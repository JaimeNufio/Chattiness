1
00:00:00,943 --> 00:00:02,871
Are you sure we got
enough plain onesies?

2
00:00:02,901 --> 00:00:06,836
Let me see. 40 people have
RSVped "yes" to Lane's shower,

3
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:09,450
and we bought 60 onesies
for them to decorate.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,073
I don't want to go all
"beautiful mind" on you,

5
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:12,661
but according to
my calculations...

6
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:16,674
Yes, Mr. Nash, but you are forgetting
about the first-pancake phenomenon.

7
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:19,331
Yes, the first pancake --
you always throw it out.

8
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,614
What if people start
decorating their onesies

9
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:23,895
and they hate what they do,
so they want to start over

10
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:26,280
and we don't have enough onesies
because we only estimated one each?

11
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:27,870
Why do you throw out
the first pancake?

12
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,800
Because the griddle's too hot.
It gets burned.

13
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,880
Oh, my god.
Next year, no excuses.

14
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,083
We are making you that
audition tape for "Top Chef."

15
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,513
This is pretty basic stuff.

16
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:38,633
Do you do it with hamburgers
and waffles, too?

17
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:39,913
No, it's pancake-specific.

18
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:42,460
Oh, my goodness.
Well, that's good news,

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,303
because onesies are the
exact opposite of pancakes.

20
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,833
They're totally
impossible to screw up.

21
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:48,793
You can slap anything on a
onesie and it looks cute.

22
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:49,803
- Anything?
- Yeah.

23
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:52,941
Alligator, fried egg, tools --

24
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:55,163
these are not generally
considered cute items.

25
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:57,880
"I'll take the adorable phillips-head
--" not something you hear normally.

26
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,032
- But you put that on a little onesie...
- You're right, it's pretty damn cute.

27
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:02,001
So cute.

28
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:04,393
All right,
we got streamers and balloons,

29
00:01:04,427 --> 00:01:06,482
and the cake's in the fridge.

30
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:08,150
The chairs are getting
delivered later.

31
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:09,742
All we have to do now is
go home and decorate.

32
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:11,770
But did we agree on one
table for presents or two?

33
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:12,371
One.

34
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:13,541
Don't you think two
would be better?

35
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:14,542
One is fine.

36
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:17,430
Okay. But I'm not going
for "fine," you know?

37
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:19,553
Lane's shower cannot be fine.
I want it to be great.

38
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:20,443
It will be.

39
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,030
Yeah, but how do you know? I don't
exactly have the best track record.

40
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:26,383
Lane's bachelorette party,
we ended up in Brian's aunt's basement.

41
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:27,811
Well, it was your
first pancake.

42
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:28,990
Hold on.

43
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:31,193
Hello?

44
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:32,981
Yes, this is Rory.

45
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:36,760
New York Times.

46
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:40,783
Hi. Um, thank you for calling me back.
Thank you so much.

47
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:41,940
Yes.

48
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:44,883
Uh... as a matter of fact,
I will be.

49
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,890
The corner of 9th and -- great.

50
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:50,021
Um, okay.
Uh, I'll see you then.

51
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,340
- Oh, my god.
- The New York Times?

52
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,892
- The New York Times!
- They called you?

53
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,562
- They called me.
- Why did they call you?

54
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:57,592
- Well --
- Don't even answer.

55
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,561
If I was the New York Times,
I would be like,

56
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,461
"Get me Rory Gilmore
on the phone, stat."

57
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:02,090
"Stat"?

58
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:04,571
Whatever the equivalent
of "stat" is in the news.

59
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:05,712
- "Now"?
- No!

60
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:08,010
At the New York Times,
the language is very fancy. You say

61
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:10,142
"promptly," "presently," "two
shakes of a lamb's tail."

62
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:11,093
Why did they call you?

63
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:14,951
Well, okay, remember that guy Hugo
Gray that I met at Logan's work party,

64
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:16,530
the guy who edits
the online magazine?

65
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,240
- Yeah, you're writing pieces for him.
- Exactly.

66
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:21,431
Hugo has an in at the Times --
this guy A.J. Abrams.

67
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,690
He's an assistant managing editor --
really big.

68
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,980
He gave me A.J.'s number and
said that I should call him

69
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:28,703
and see if he would get together with me
for coffee so I could pick his brain.

70
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:29,502
A.J.'s brain?

71
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:31,433
Well, Hugo's brain
had been picked clean.

72
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:34,061
But, yeah, I called A.J.,
and I never heard back.

73
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:36,751
I didn't think he was gonna call me,
but that was him just now on the phone,

74
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:39,701
and he said that if I was gonna be
in the city tomorrow around 1:00,

75
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,392
he could meet me for coffee.

76
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:44,962
And I said, "oh, well,
as a matter of fact, I will be."

77
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,102
He said something about a place on 9th,
and I said, "okay,"

78
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,253
and he said, "see you tomorrow,"
and I said, "see you then."

79
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:52,770
Oh, my god, if this is any indication
of the crackling spitfire dialogue

80
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,392
to come at your coffee
tomorrow -- ha!

81
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,001
This is the worst possible time,
but I just couldn't say no.

82
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:59,931
No, you couldn't say no.
I mean, let's face it.

83
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,542
"Top Chef" is a long shot.
This is the New York Times.

84
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:03,700
I know!

85
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:06,390
But I have so much to do to get
ready for Lane's baby shower.

86
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:08,040
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you sure?

87
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:10,461
Yes, I'm like a
professional party-thrower.

88
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:12,331
- Well, I know, but --
- No buts.

89
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:14,622
Okay, I mean --
that would be great.

90
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:16,561
I should probably spend the
night at Logan's tonight.

91
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,901
My laptop's there. I need to
print out my résumé, I should --

92
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,351
God, I need to prepare.

93
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:23,073
He's gonna expect me to ask him
really intelligent questions.

94
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:25,702
Honey, you've been asking intelligent
questions since you were 3.

95
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:28,310
Yeah, he's probably expecting
something a little more sophisticated.

96
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:31,170
Than "what is a color?" That one,
like, blew my mind.

97
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:33,650
Something a little more
newspaper-related, at the very least.

98
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:34,831
You're gonna be great.

99
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,551
I hope so. Even if they
don't have an opening there,

100
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:39,781
he knows people all across the country,
you know?

101
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:42,692
If I impress him, he can probably set
me up with some really good leads.

102
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:45,520
Yeah, well, tell him your mother
thinks you're spectacular.

103
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:47,271
I will do. Oh, my god.

104
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:50,723
The New York Times called me --
and not the subscriptions department.

105
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,473
Is it straight?

106
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:48,760
Oh, it's cute.
Yes, that's funny.

107
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:49,583
Thanks.

108
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:50,700
- Not what you asked.
- No.

109
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,341
- Hit me again.
- Is the sign straight?

110
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:54,243
- Uh, perfect.
- Great.

111
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:56,791
Ooh, Angelina and Brad
had their baby...

112
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:58,730
months and months ago!

113
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:00,180
Yeah, you're a little
behind the times.

114
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:02,852
This is the problem with having
two kids under the age of 4 --

115
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,363
world events just pass you by.

116
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:06,913
Are you done with those favors?

117
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:10,922
I cannot believe Britney is driving
with her baby on her lap like that.

118
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:13,283
What is she doing with that guy,
by the way?

119
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:16,421
Well, you'll be glad to know
they've since broken up,

120
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:18,843
although it turns out he was kind of
a stabilizing influence in her life.

121
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,553
- Who knew?
- You're kidding.

122
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:23,911
I know --
why don't you blow up some more balloons

123
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:25,290
or hang some streamers?

124
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,421
I would love to, but it seems
like the baby really wants me

125
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,753
to just keep sitting here
and reading in touch.

126
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:33,520
You know that excuse expires the
minute you pop that baby out.

127
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:36,380
Yep, but I've got
128 lazy days left.

128
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:39,492
Hey, why don't you go through
the stack of pictures?

129
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:42,612
'Cause Rory is looking for one of
Lane that she wants to blow up.

130
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:44,841
Ooh, baby pictures -- fun!

131
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:46,492
What do we got?

132
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:51,031
Oh, god. Ooh!
This one is so cute.

133
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,150
- That's just of Rory, though.
- I know.

134
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:56,961
She was just an itty-bitty, teeny,
little, cutie-patootie, wasn't she?

135
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:58,172
Yeah, she's cute.

136
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:01,200
Oh, she weally,
weally was, wasn't she?

137
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,492
Seriously, with the voice...

138
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:04,441
Well, sorry. I'm hormonal.

139
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:07,760
I just can't believe
this wittle girl

140
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:09,673
might be working at
the New York Times.

141
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:13,082
She's not so wittle anymore.
Hey, less Rory, more Lane.

142
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:16,383
Don't blame me. I'm not the one that
got camera-happy for this Rory kid.

143
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:19,010
All right. I'm gonna call Mrs.
Kim. She'll have some good ones.

144
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:20,250
Have you seen the phone?

145
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,990
See, the thing is,
when I sat down,

146
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:24,660
I realized it was behind me,

147
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,713
kind of right on my lower back,
and normally I would have pulled it out,

148
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:31,660
but it's really kind of hitting just
the right spot where I've had a knot

149
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,043
for like a week.

150
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:35,033
Did I mention I was pregnant?

151
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:45,652
Logan?

152
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:48,343
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Go back to bed. Go back to bed.

153
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:51,052
- Logan, it's really late.
- I know. I know.

154
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:52,913
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Go back to bed.

155
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,593
Is this all the cheese that we have?
I could have sworn we had more cheese.

156
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,891
- It's 3:00 in the morning.
- I know.

157
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:04,153
Here, keep that closed. We're gonna need
that in the sandwich-making process.

158
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:06,082
Where were you?

159
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:07,700
What? I was at work.

160
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:09,273
You were at work till
3:00 in the morning?

161
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,051
I work till 3:00 all the time.

162
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:14,502
I mean, not tonight --
tonight, I worked till about 10:00,

163
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:17,113
and that's when Philip and I got something
to drink, and then a little something

164
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:18,771
- turned into a lot of something.
- Yeah.

165
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,940
Who keeps bread in the refrigerator?
I hate cold bread.

166
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:24,201
God, these twist
ties are impossible.

167
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,752
- Okay, move.
- What?

168
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:28,173
- I'll make you a sandwich.
- You will?

169
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,370
- Yes, I will.
- Oh, you're so sweet.

170
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,442
Well, I'm not being sweet.
You're just making a mess.

171
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:34,773
- I should have called you.
- Yes, you should have.

172
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:37,953
- Uh-oh. You're mad.
- Yes, I'm mad.

173
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:39,742
I was worried about you.

174
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,531
I called you four times
before I went to sleep, okay?

175
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,263
You didn't answer,
no call back.

176
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:47,123
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

177
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:49,012
Well, my phone was on "off."

178
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:52,951
Which totally sounds like it's on,
but it's not. It's on "off,"

179
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:54,832
which is on "off."

180
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:57,422
- On "off," got it?
- I get it.

181
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:00,840
What, I'm not allowed to go out with
my friends every once in a while?

182
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:04,102
I work hard, okay?
Life is hard. I just --

183
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:06,180
- I need to --
- You need to what?

184
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:09,432
I need to not be doing this right now,
okay? I just --

185
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,902
You know what? Forget the sandwich.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

186
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:27,060
So you're telling me you
won't eat this oatmeal?

187
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:29,113
The are rolled oats
repeatedly cut,

188
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:31,203
twice steamed,
and processed extensively.

189
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:33,591
And the oatmeal you thought
you were ordering was...

190
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,552
Steel cut,
which are whole-grain oats,

191
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:38,503
retaining the more natural, nutty
flavor of the original oat kernels.

192
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:40,471
Okay, okay. I think I got it.

193
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,602
You're like an analog
guy with a CD.

194
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:44,892
You miss the vinyl's
cool scratches and pops.

195
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:46,781
I think I can work with that.

196
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:52,250
This dude over here wants to replace
this with some sort of steel oatmeal.

197
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:55,423
Tell him we've got it but it takes forever
to cook, and then deliver those plates

198
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:57,082
- to table 5.
- I'm on it.

199
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:59,071
Luke, check it out.
I've been published.

200
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,021
You have?

201
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,622
Mother wanted to sell her dinette set,
so I put pen to paper,

202
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:05,283
got my creative juices flowing,
and voilà.

203
00:09:05,316 --> 00:09:07,153
You put a want ad in the
Stars Hollow Gazette?

204
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:09,942
It's a powerful feeling seeing
yourself immortalized in print.

205
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:13,383
Sure, it's only newsprint. It rips
easily, it comes off on your fingers,

206
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:16,182
and the next day,
people use it to wrap fish, but,

207
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:17,773
hey, it's how
Dickens got started.

208
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:19,023
In want ads?

209
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:21,071
Man, this thing really flows --

210
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:23,432
"vintage dinette set, formica,

211
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,740
barely chipped,
priced to move."

212
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,590
It's precise, efficient,

213
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:30,183
Hemingwayesque in
its terse simplicity.

214
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:33,891
With two buns in the oven, you wouldn't
be interested in a dinette set, would you?

215
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:35,990
- 64.
- No, thanks, man.

216
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,463
Hey, Luke, you still haven't
RSVped for the baby shower.

217
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:40,203
Yeah, I don't
think I'm gonna go.

218
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:42,591
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's not my thing, you know?

219
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,101
But there's a gift for you in the back.
You should take it before you leave.

220
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:46,490
Wait -- gifts are required?

221
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,063
Yeah, that's kind
of the whole point.

222
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:50,090
At least that's how Lane talked
me into the whole thing.

223
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,570
Damn. It's my
first baby shower.

224
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,781
I've been so caught up with
the wardrobe question.

225
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:57,513
Just to clarify, people don't
actually dress like babies, do they?

226
00:09:57,545 --> 00:09:59,562
I think what you're
wearing is fine, dude.

227
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:01,393
- Luke, you should come.
- Yeah, thanks.

228
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:03,222
Look, it's not gonna be
too much of a rager --

229
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,720
real mellow vibe,
and I promise not too much baby stuff.

230
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:07,972
There won't be anything weird
or queer about it at all.

231
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,181
I'll think about it.

232
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,650
Listen to this one --

233
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:13,940
"Does the spray of the open
ocean call your name?"

234
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:16,550
Evocative, huh?
This guy can write.

235
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:19,100
"Sturdy 15-foot fishing boat.

236
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:23,011
Back-to-back seats, closed bow,
meticulously handcrafted."

237
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:25,431
How far out of town
is 1211 Elmwood?

238
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:28,112
1211 Elmwood?

239
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:30,223
- That's what it says here.
- Let me see that.

240
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:32,972
- That's my boat!
- Really?

241
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,091
How much are you asking?

242
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:36,840
Because I wasn't looking for a boat,
but that ad is so snappy,

243
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:38,973
it makes me think I
wouldn't mind owning one.

244
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:43,921
So, what's it going to be,
yes or no?

245
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:46,401
Well, I really like them.
I'm just not sure

246
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:47,750
how they're gonna
work in the room.

247
00:10:47,786 --> 00:10:50,432
They will work. They are teak.
Teak is a hardworking wood.

248
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,032
How about I take
them out on memo?

249
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:52,761
Memo?

250
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:54,943
You know, bring them home,
see how they look.

251
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:56,482
If I like them,
then I'll buy them.

252
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:58,832
No! I do not work with memos.
I work with money.

253
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,650
You buy them,
and then you take them home.

254
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:02,410
What if they don't
fit next to the bed?

255
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:03,882
Then you'll get a new bed.

256
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:06,122
- Hi, Mrs. Kim.
- Lorelai.

257
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:08,141
- How's business?
- People die, go bankrupt.

258
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:09,942
- There's always furniture to sell.
- Sounds good.

259
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,530
- You've come for pictures of Lane?
- Yeah.

260
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:12,803
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

261
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:15,693
I am giving these to you
in pristine condition,

262
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:18,132
and I expect that that is
how they will be returned.

263
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:20,430
Do not cut them up or
put glue on the back.

264
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,673
I will do my best.

265
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,763
I will return them in the condition
in which they were received.

266
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:25,943
See you at the shower.

267
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:27,452
Oh, no, you won't.

268
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,120
- Why?
- I'm not going.

269
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,021
You're not going to your
daughter's baby shower? Why not?

270
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,092
Lane knows why.

271
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:33,910
Oh. There's a problem
between you two?

272
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:34,563
Yes.

273
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:36,390
Do you think you could
put it aside for one day?

274
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:37,021
No.

275
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:38,892
- It's that big a deal?
- Yes.

276
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:41,522
Is there anything Lane could say
or do that would change your mind?

277
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:42,393
Yes.

278
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:44,470
- Does Lane know what it is?
- Yes.

279
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:46,143
What do I have,
like 14 questions left?

280
00:11:46,177 --> 00:11:47,091
I have work to do.

281
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:49,791
Mrs. Kim, I know Lane would really
like you to be at the shower.

282
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,651
Well, life is full
of disappointments.

283
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:53,171
You can show yourself out.

284
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:56,200
Too late!
You cannot buy those tables anymore!

285
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:58,350
Okay, then.

286
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,172
- Hi.
- Hi.

287
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:05,262
Wow. Sorry, but, hoo! Wow.

288
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:08,820
I know, every day, I think I can't
possibly get any bigger, and then I do.

289
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:10,180
It's looking homey in here.

290
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,373
Thanks. According to my book,
I'm nesting.

291
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:14,881
I hope it stops soon.
It's sort of creeping me out.

292
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,060
So, what's up?

293
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:18,823
Um, well,
I wanted to talk to you about your mom.

294
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:21,693
- What happened with you guys?
- Ask her.

295
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:23,951
No, I've already been through that.
You tell me what happened.

296
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:25,221
We got in a fight.

297
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:27,910
And now she says she's not
coming to my baby shower.

298
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,091
So, fine. She's not coming.
I don't care.

299
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:30,830
Lane.

300
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,641
I don't. Why should I?
She doesn't.

301
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:34,041
Of course she does.

302
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:36,051
Not more than she cares
about fried shrimp.

303
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,540
You lost me there.

304
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:39,863
Well, last night,
my mom was over.

305
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:42,901
And Zach had cut out an ad for
the seafood festival red lobster.

306
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:45,351
He was trying to figure out, if we
went there after we had the babies,

307
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:47,540
could we get the endless
shrimp but at the kids' price?

308
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:51,130
No, you can only get the kidsprice when
accompanied by an adult paying full price.

309
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,740
- That blows.
- I know.

310
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:53,930
Then what happened?

311
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:56,622
So then my mom sticks her
nosy head in and said,

312
00:12:56,657 --> 00:12:58,970
"the children are not gonna
be eating fried shrimp."

313
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:02,852
And I said, "not only are my children
gonna be eating fried shrimp,

314
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:05,052
they're gonna listen to
whatever music they want

315
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,270
and go to school dances, and they're
not gonna spend their whole lives

316
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:11,152
in church hearing about how
doing all that makes them evil.

317
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,583
In fact, they'll probably never
set foot in a church at all.

318
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:16,243
My kids are gonna have total freedom.
End of story."

319
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:18,220
- Total freedom, huh?
- Yep.

320
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,193
Wow, you're just gonna let them follow
their passion, no matter what it is?

321
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,070
Exactly.

322
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:24,542
What if you get kids who are
passionate about religion?

323
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:27,592
You may have kids who
want to study the bible.

324
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:30,350
Trust me -- my kids are not
gonna want to study the bible.

325
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:32,130
You don't know what your
kids are gonna want.

326
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:34,021
You think your mom thought
she was gonna get a kid

327
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:35,560
who loved Jane's addiction?

328
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:36,511
Well...

329
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:40,041
You might get kids who are nuts
for exodus, crazy for deuteronomy,

330
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:42,963
and then what? You want them hiding
their bibles under the floorboards?

331
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:46,440
Well, look,
if my kids want to go to bible study,

332
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:48,050
they can go to bible study.

333
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:50,552
Well, see?
And then what about church?

334
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:53,362
If they want to go to church,
you're not gonna let them,

335
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:55,960
even at Christmas,
when they have the manger

336
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:58,760
and the petting zoo with
the sheep and the donkeys?

337
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,710
Well, I might take
them at Christmas.

338
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:02,893
Okay, so when you say they're never
going to church, you don't really mean

339
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,383
they're never going to church.

340
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,881
Okay, not never never,
but mostly never.

341
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,943
- Can't you tell your mom that?
- No way.

342
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,381
Can I tell your mom that?

343
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,241
Okay, if you want, but tell her I
am not bending on the shrimp thing.

344
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:16,660
I got you there. Fried shrimp is one
of the best things on the planet.

345
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,811
A double whammy --
unclean meat fried in unclean oil.

346
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,803
That doesn't sound as good,
but look at it this way.

347
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:24,001
For the first year, your kids
won't be eating solid food anyway,

348
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:26,023
and I don't think they
make mashed fried shrimp.

349
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:27,161
- So?
- So,

350
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:30,353
you could tell your mother that
your kids will not eat fried shrimp

351
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:32,133
for at least a year, right?

352
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,352
Well, technically.

353
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,702
"Technically" is
good enough for me.

354
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:37,262
You sit tight. I'll be back.

355
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:47,480
It's after 12:00.
Is anyone alive in there?

356
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:50,322
I'm alive,
but I think my brain is dead.

357
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,582
I'll alert the transplant team.

358
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:53,910
You gave away my organs?

359
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:55,700
They're waiting on the
roof with a cooler.

360
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,302
Take these.

361
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:00,220
Will I wake up in a bathtub
full of ice with no kidneys?

362
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:02,090
If you did,
would you feel better or worse?

363
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:03,423
About the same.

364
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:05,830
Your dad's secretary called
three times this morning.

365
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:07,503
Okay, now I feel worse.

366
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,083
Logan, what's going on?

367
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,202
Nothing.

368
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:11,923
You're not gonna
call your dad back?

369
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:15,093
My head grew three sizes overnight.
I'm in no condition to talk to anybody.

370
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:16,633
Why are you so dressed up?

371
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,212
Coffee with the
New York Times --

372
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,193
the whole reason why I
stayed over last night.

373
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:22,313
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That's today.

374
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:25,142
Yes, and Lane's baby shower.
I'm gonna need you to be ready

375
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:27,850
to leave for Stars Hollow
the second I get back.

376
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:30,860
We're gonna be cutting it really close.
Lane's shower starts at 4:00.

377
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:33,900
I should be back by 2:00 or
2:30 at the latest. Got it?

378
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:34,901
Got it.

379
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:37,921
Okay, I'll just come home,
grab my outfit, and we'll go.

380
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:40,341
I'm gonna need you to drive because
I have to change in the backseat,

381
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,940
"Dirty Dancing"-style.

382
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:43,120
Do you want me to get that?

383
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:43,900
Leave it.

384
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:46,400
- If you don't want to get up, I can --
- I said, "leave it."

385
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:51,002
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

386
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:54,390
I better go.
I don't want to be late.

387
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,402
It's Logan. Leave a message.

388
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:02,272
Hi, Logan. It's Doris from
your father's office again.

389
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:04,400
If you could just give us a
call back here at the office

390
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:06,071
as soon as you
get this message.

391
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:08,390
I know you have the number,
but just in case...

392
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:12,221
See? Look at it.
It's just sitting here

393
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:14,403
gathering dust and
taking up space.

394
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:17,900
If we got rid of the boat, we could turn
this place into a workshop for my jewelry,

395
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,743
and I really could
use the space.

396
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:22,700
Doula's gonna be crawling around soon,
getting into everything.

397
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:25,502
And jewelry-making's really
a dangerous business, Luke.

398
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:28,773
You got all those tiny beads --
choking hazards galore.

399
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:31,013
Yeah, babies really like to
put stuff in their mouth.

400
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:32,641
They can't help it.
They get mesmerized.

401
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:36,442
The little suckers look so much
like candy or pistachio nuts,

402
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:37,943
you just want to pop
them in your mouth.

403
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:41,262
Yeah, so as you can see,
we could really use the space.

404
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:44,273
So you were just gonna sell
the boat out from under me.

405
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:45,842
Of course not.

406
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,880
We just figured we'd take an ad,
get an offer, see what you say.

407
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,682
Yeah, could be great, huh?
You get a little extra cash,

408
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,202
we get a little extra space.

409
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:56,461
Plus, we were thinking maybe you
could invest some of the profits

410
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:58,371
from the boat in
Liz's business.

411
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:00,601
If you felt like it was
the right thing to do.

412
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:03,192
But it does kind of make sense
since we went through the trouble

413
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:04,511
of selling the boat...

414
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,073
and storing it.

415
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:08,000
Whoa. Doula alert.

416
00:17:10,356 --> 00:17:12,293
Not up yet -- just a squawk.

417
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:15,932
Look, guys,
I appreciate your situation here,

418
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,511
but I'm not selling the boat.

419
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:20,142
Dad left it to me.
It's my boat. End of discussion.

420
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:21,911
Hey, look, don't worry,
all right?

421
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:24,401
- I'll find another place to store it.
- Like where?

422
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:26,803
I don't know. I'll find a place.
Another place.

423
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:29,633
What's the point of hanging on to it?
You're never gonna use it.

424
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:32,351
- I might.
- You might. Dad might.

425
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,941
- What are you talking about?
- The boat.

426
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:36,280
Dad spent like 20 years
working on the thing.

427
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:38,272
- You spent another 20.
- So?

428
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:42,363
So? How many generations are
gonna cart this thing around town?

429
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:46,390
Look, get rid of it for your own sake,
before you end up like dad.

430
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:48,230
What does that mean?

431
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:51,501
Oh, okay. Okay, forget it.

432
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,320
No, I want to know.
What does that mean?

433
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,412
- He was stuck, Luke.
- He was happy.

434
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:58,152
He was stuck doing the same
thing at the same time

435
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:00,993
the same way every
day of his life.

436
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,771
So? He did the things
that made him happy.

437
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:04,520
Dad didn't do stuff
'cause it made him happy.

438
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:07,222
He did stuff because he was
afraid to do anything else.

439
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:08,320
Come on, that's crap.

440
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:11,372
- Luke, I loved dad as much as you did.
- Look, he was good to us.

441
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:13,622
Of course he was.
I'm just saying

442
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:17,453
sometimes a little change
can be a good thing.

443
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,943
My boat, my decision.
I'm not selling it.

444
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:23,481
- All right? All right.
- Okay. Okay.

445
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,082
I'll have it out of
here by tomorrow.

446
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:30,452
Hello?

447
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:32,623
How bald do you have
to be to be bald?

448
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:34,602
Is this a zen call?
You know I hate those.

449
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,730
Does it mean completely bald,
or does it count

450
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,622
if there's no hair on top
but a little on the sides?

451
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:41,531
Well, in my experience,
if a man describes himself as bald,

452
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:42,982
there is nary a hair.

453
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:44,143
Nice use of "nary."

454
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:46,031
I'm trying to get you in
the New York Times mood,

455
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:47,413
use some fancy language.

456
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:50,053
Well, I will remember that
if I can ever find the guy.

457
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:52,532
Who knew New York was the
bald-guy capital of the world?

458
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,383
I think that's on
their license plate.

459
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:57,650
I'm telling you, they're everywhere, and
since I don't know which one A.J. is,

460
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,891
every time one walks in the door,
I just smile at him.

461
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:02,230
And let me guess --
they're all smiling back.

462
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:04,542
What's wrong with me?
What kind of reporter am I going to be

463
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,310
if all I got was "bald guy"?

464
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,763
Oh, relax.
He knows what you look like, right?

465
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:10,772
I just hate this waiting.
What should I do?

466
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:13,222
Should I go order a coffee without him?
Should I wait for him?

467
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:14,801
Order coffee. He won't mind.

468
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:17,441
Well, I can't, really.
I'm at a table.

469
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:19,802
I don't even know if I should be
sitting down already, but I walked in,

470
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:22,160
it was really crowded, and this woman
left her table, so I grabbed it,

471
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:23,970
and now I'm scared to get up
because maybe I'll lose it.

472
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:25,930
- Keep the table, skip the coffee.
- Really?

473
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,631
Yeah. And when he gets there,
go decaf.

474
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,711
Yeah, I know I'm a little nervous, but it's
only because doing well at this meeting

475
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:32,793
could mean the difference between
interviewing world leaders

476
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:35,211
and standing on street corners
with pictures of celebrities

477
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:37,690
in matching outfits asking
passersby who wore it best.

478
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:39,000
Pretty high stakes.

479
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,560
I know. Distract me.
How's the shower stuff going?

480
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,560
Oh, something's wrong!

481
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:44,870
No, nothing's wrong.

482
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,980
Oh, I knew it.
My second pancake's gonna suck, too.

483
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:51,442
I've got it all under control. You just
focus on finding the right bald guy.

484
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:52,963
Oh, another one just walked in.

485
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:55,143
- Oh, head-to-hair ratio?
- Very low.

486
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:56,971
Stand by while I attempt
to make eye contact.

487
00:19:56,985 --> 00:19:58,851
Lookt it this way --
you're making a lot of bald men

488
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:01,020
feel very good about
themselves today.

489
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,883
- I better go.
- Knock 'em dead, kid.

490
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:09,683
So, you're giving me a guarantee
for Christmas and easter.

491
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:10,791
As a minimum.

492
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:13,270
And there will be a
possibility of bible study

493
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:15,681
and no unclean meats
for at least a year.

494
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,713
That's a start, at least.

495
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:19,240
- So, do we have a deal?
- No, I never take first offer.

496
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:22,631
This is what I want --
attendance at weekly church services,

497
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,262
bible study twice a week,
adventist summer camp,

498
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:27,561
no unclean meats or
hydrogenated oils,

499
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:29,651
Christmas will be
celebrated with no gifts,

500
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,930
and there will be no sandboxes
or parties with pony rides.

501
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:33,890
What's wrong with ponies?

502
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:36,170
Flies buzzing around,
carrying infectious diseases.

503
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:39,350
No infected ponies, fine.
But sandboxes? I mean, come on.

504
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,560
Kids play, they go to the park.
You have to be reasonable.

505
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:43,703
It is not reasonable
for Lane to think

506
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:46,292
that she will raise my
grandchildren as heathens

507
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,013
while I stand by
and do nothing.

508
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,492
I understand, Mrs. Kim.
It's a really sensitive subject.

509
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:51,680
No, you don't.

510
00:20:51,716 --> 00:20:54,352
Your daughter doesn't reject
everything you stand for.

511
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:57,342
But Lane is not rejecting you.
You guys are just different.

512
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,230
God knows my mother
and I had differences.

513
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:02,093
Yes. God does know.

514
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:06,830
Look... there are times when you
have to put those differences aside.

515
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,553
Like, you know Joseph,
from the bible,

516
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,390
and how his brothers got all
mad at him about that dreamcoat.

517
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:14,782
Yes, and so they sold
him into slavery.

518
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:16,883
Yeah. I don't think that
was in the musical.

519
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:19,651
The point is there are fights you can
recover from and fights you can't,

520
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:21,830
and not going to your
daughter's baby shower --

521
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,811
I mean, I know it's hard,

522
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:27,761
but I don't want you to draw a line in
the sand now that you can't cross later.

523
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:30,330
My mother missed so much.

524
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:32,450
I don't want that
to happen to you.

525
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:43,651
- Hello?
- Hey.

526
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:44,770
Hey, dad.

527
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,033
How was swim practice?

528
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:49,500
Drills, drills, drills. Coach scott
made us swim with our fists closed.

529
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:51,501
- What does that do?
- Probably nothing.

530
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:54,523
Just looks funny. I did get to
work on my backward racing start.

531
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:55,771
How'd that go?

532
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:59,230
Not so good. I think I ended up
with half the pool up my nose.

533
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:00,700
Eh, you'll get better.

534
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,092
Can't get much worse.

535
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,410
So, how's your mom doing?

536
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:06,053
Good. Little stressed
about the new store.

537
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:08,440
She likes the space,
but she's not sure about the location.

538
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:09,880
Strip malls bum her out.

539
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:12,062
So what's going on?

540
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,303
Nothing. You know,
business as usual.

541
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:17,620
I saw your cousin Doula today.
She looks good. She's getting bigger.

542
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:19,182
You promised you'd
send me new pictures.

543
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:20,540
I will. I will.

544
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:24,571
So, look, I was thinking about this
summer when you come to visit.

545
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,340
I can't wait.

546
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:27,781
Yeah, me too.

547
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:31,750
So, I was thinking maybe
we should take a trip.

548
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:32,760
A trip?

549
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:34,510
Yeah, a big one, you know?

550
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:36,990
You're gonna be here
for six weeks, right?

551
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,023
So maybe we should
just take off.

552
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:40,520
And go where?

553
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:43,730
You know, I don't know.
I was thinking Florida.

554
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:44,660
Florida?

555
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:47,091
Yeah, you know,
go down to Disneyworld.

556
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:48,992
You want to go to disneyworld?

557
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:51,843
Yeah. You've never been there.
I've never been there.

558
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:54,612
We could fly down to Florida
and check out Miami Beach

559
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:58,071
and then go to... Disneyworld.

560
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:02,383
I-I can't imagine you at Disneyworld --
or at the beach, for that matter.

561
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:03,741
W-Why not?

562
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,132
I don't know --

563
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:08,063
riding roller coasters, getting
your picture taken with mickey mouse.

564
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,810
I'm just having
trouble picturing it.

565
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:11,433
Yeah, well...

566
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:14,661
Look, dad, you don't have to do this.
It's okay.

567
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:18,502
I'm looking forward to the summer, but
it's not like I'm expecting anything.

568
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:19,872
Oh, no, sure.

569
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:23,450
I mean, I'm fine just hanging out
at the diner like we always do --

570
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:26,192
wipe down tables,
refill salt and pepper shakers.

571
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:29,141
It's our thing.
Really, honestly, it's fine.

572
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:32,122
Oh, okay.

573
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:34,930
Oh, mom wants to talk to you real
quick about some travel stuff

574
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,842
for my spring break.
But don't hang up when you're done,

575
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:38,463
'cause I want to read
you something I wrote.

576
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:39,381
Oh, yeah?

577
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,700
We had to write a
five-page fictional story

578
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:44,581
featuring someone we know as the hero,
and I chose Kirk.

579
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:45,812
It's hilarious.

580
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:48,313
I'll give you to mom,
and I'll get the story.

581
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:49,921
Okay, great.

582
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:57,522
Hi.

583
00:23:58,487 --> 00:23:59,801
Can we come in?

584
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:02,360
Sure. Whatever.

585
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:06,152
Isn't that nice? So great.

586
00:24:06,426 --> 00:24:07,791
Okay.

587
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:10,160
Here we go.

588
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:13,721
So...

589
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:15,102
So.

590
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:16,981
So, what?

591
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:19,822
Your mother has something
she'd like to say to you.

592
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,162
You say it.

593
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:24,263
Me? Um... you'll jump in?

594
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:25,211
Okay.

595
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:26,960
Uh... Lane, um...

596
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:29,433
your mother realizes that the
two of you have differences.

597
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,672
She might not always agree
with all of your decisions.

598
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:33,200
No "might." She doesn't agree.

599
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,413
I know.
You've made yourself perfectly clear.

600
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:36,411
Lane.

601
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:38,583
Sorry. Go on.

602
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:40,642
She doesn't agree with
all your decisions.

603
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:43,760
However, she knows how much
you love and respect her.

604
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,083
Don't you, Lane?

605
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:47,042
Of course I do.

606
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,740
And she'd very much like
to come to your shower.

607
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:52,720
- Really?
- Really.

608
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:56,201
Thank you, mama.

609
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:59,130
- Lane?
- You okay?

610
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,472
I think so.

611
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:02,671
What's wrong?
Are you going into labor?

612
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,413
I don't know.
I've never been in labor before.

613
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:05,792
You might have
had a contraction.

614
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:07,100
We'll wait and see
if you have another.

615
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,792
There will be no waiting. You will
drive us to the hospital right now.

616
00:25:09,825 --> 00:25:11,260
- Hurry, Lorelai.
- Okay.

617
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:12,982
Careful, Lane.
Wait. I'll get it.

618
00:25:13,018 --> 00:25:15,280
Uh, well, okay. You got it.

619
00:25:15,318 --> 00:25:16,870
- You got it.
- All right.

620
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:18,003
Here we go.

621
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:20,082
I can't believe I'm on bed rest.
This sucks.

622
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:23,250
Oh, come on, haven't you ever
had one of those lazy sundays

623
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:26,861
where you stay in bed all day? Just
think of this as one long lazy sunday.

624
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:29,222
Yeah, babe. Plus you get to
eat all your meals on trays.

625
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:31,242
That's pretty cool.
And I'm gonna hang out with you,

626
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:33,762
- just like John and Yoko.
- This is your fault.

627
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,471
Mine? See what I deal with?

628
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:36,100
Lane...

629
00:25:36,107 --> 00:25:37,813
We shouldn't have
gone to the hospital.

630
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,921
Better I watch my
daughter writhe in pain?

631
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:42,343
I wasn't writhing.
Lorelai, tell her I wasn't writhing.

632
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:44,921
Does it really matter who
was or wasn't writhing?

633
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:46,331
Your mom was worried about you.

634
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:48,142
Yeah, right.
She's probably happy.

635
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:50,701
- Why would I be happy?
- 'Cause now I can't have my party.

636
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:53,242
Lane Van Gerbig,
what is wrong with you?

637
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:55,593
Parties are not the most
important thing in life.

638
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,601
I know.

639
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,860
- Do you?
- Of course.

640
00:25:57,895 --> 00:25:59,990
It's just that this
one is my last.

641
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,351
Why is it your last?

642
00:26:01,388 --> 00:26:02,992
I'm about to be a mother.

643
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:05,053
Um, mothers can have parties.

644
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:07,973
Not for themselves.
They only do things for their children.

645
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:10,161
She did everything for me.

646
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:14,460
And... I'm...
gonna be the same way.

647
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:17,871
You will have the party.

648
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:19,023
How?

649
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:22,141
Uh... Lorelai will
figure something out.

650
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:23,400
Cool!

651
00:26:26,146 --> 00:26:27,720
Hello. I'm home.

652
00:26:27,757 --> 00:26:29,053
Hey. How'd it go?

653
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,392
Awesome.

654
00:26:31,237 --> 00:26:33,640
Logan! You're not dressed!

655
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,792
It's 2:30.
You were supposed to be dressed

656
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:37,283
- and ready.
- I'm dressed.

657
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:39,553
But not for Lane's shower.
Come on, get up. Let's go.

658
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:41,482
Wait, wait. Sit down.
Tell me how it went.

659
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,883
I'll tell you on the way.
Come on.

660
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:44,840
Wait. Sit down.
I have to tell you something.

661
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:46,542
Well, that doesn't
sound so good.

662
00:26:46,578 --> 00:26:47,672
It's not.

663
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:52,200
Look, I screwed up,
okay? Big-time.

664
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,523
What's going on?

665
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:56,023
The company I bought,
the new business I was trying to start?

666
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:57,833
- It's a bust.
- What?

667
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,690
We're going belly-up
because of me.

668
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:02,312
I lost everybody's money --
my money, my dad's money,

669
00:27:02,345 --> 00:27:04,740
all our investors' money,
the parking-lot attendant's money,

670
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:07,362
the hot-dog vendor's money.
I lost money I didn't even know I had.

671
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:09,703
- Logan, be serious.
- I am.

672
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:14,360
Well... if you are, then back up a step.
Explain this to me.

673
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:17,203
There's nothing to explain.
The second we bought this company,

674
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,211
all these lawsuits came
out of the woodwork.

675
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:21,352
- So?
- So one of them has merit,

676
00:27:21,387 --> 00:27:24,090
which means we're screwed --
no money, no jobs, no nothing.

677
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:27,222
Um... I don't understand.

678
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:29,083
How long have you
known about this?

679
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,271
Weeks.

680
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:31,593
Weeks?

681
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:33,642
Why didn't you say
something about it to me?

682
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:36,302
I don't know. I thought maybe
I could fix it, you know?

683
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:37,991
I was looking for loopholes.

684
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:39,861
Well, you can keep looking.
You'll find one.

685
00:27:39,898 --> 00:27:42,061
No, we can't. Look, it's over.

686
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,772
Philip and I got the final call
last lignt from our patent lawyers.

687
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:47,200
Their case is solid.
There's nothing we can do but settle.

688
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:49,540
I screwed up, okay?
I rushed in.

689
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:51,682
I didn't do my research.
It's all my fault.

690
00:27:51,718 --> 00:27:54,061
Well, I'm sure that's not true.
I'm sure there's something --

691
00:27:54,098 --> 00:27:56,233
Rory, you're not getting this.

692
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:58,572
This is huge.
This isn't something you can fix

693
00:27:58,608 --> 00:28:01,091
with a plucky,
good attitude and a can-do spirit.

694
00:28:01,128 --> 00:28:03,641
- Well, I'm just trying to help.
- I know.

695
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,590
Well, what about your dad?
What's he say about all this?

696
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:09,073
I haven't talked to him.

697
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:10,573
Logan, you're gonna
have to talk to him.

698
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,071
Rory, don't give me
any grief about this.

699
00:28:12,105 --> 00:28:14,352
Any minute now, Mitchum is gonna
be busting through that door

700
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:17,491
champing at the bit to tell me
what a gigantic failure I am.

701
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:21,343
God, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about all this.

702
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:22,722
I know you are.

703
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:26,560
Well, you'll get through it.
We'll get through it.

704
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:29,372
I mean, whatever happens,
we'll figure it out together.

705
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,890
Sure. And I'm
sorry about today.

706
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:33,720
I just can't deal
with a baby shower.

707
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:35,743
No, I know. I get it.

708
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:39,020
The minute it's over,
I will come back, and I'll bring cake.

709
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:41,141
- You don't have to hurry.
- I want to.

710
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:43,700
No, it's cool, don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna be here.

711
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:44,910
You're going out?

712
00:28:44,945 --> 00:28:47,021
I'm gonna go to Vegas
with Colin and Finn.

713
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:48,370
What?

714
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:50,750
Yeah, I just need to blow
off steam for a couple days.

715
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:52,972
- With Colin and Finn.
- It's perfect timing.

716
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:56,671
Colin's got his dad's jet gassed up at
Teterboro. I'm gonna meet him in an hour.

717
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:58,851
To go to Vegas with
Colin and Finn.

718
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:01,501
Yeah. Finn bought a
racehorse with George Maloof.

719
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:03,822
How hilarious is that?
I'm gonna go take a shower.

720
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:06,253
Are you kidding me?
This is really what you want to do?

721
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,510
I just need a break, okay?

722
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:11,500
Tell Lane I said congrats.

723
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:20,662
Word on the street is you
want to sell your boat.

724
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:22,663
I called you, Kirk.

725
00:29:22,698 --> 00:29:24,950
Yeah, but I was on the
street when I got that call.

726
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:27,222
And to be honest with you,
I was a little surprised

727
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:29,551
to hear about this
turn of events.

728
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:32,941
It's not a turn of events, Kirk.
I just want to sell my boat.

729
00:29:32,977 --> 00:29:35,102
But you've always been really
attached to this boat.

730
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:36,943
Hell, I thought you'd take
it to your grave with you,

731
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,841
maybe row yourself
across the river Styx.

732
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:41,021
Turns out I'm not using it.
You interested?

733
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:44,140
It does suit me.
And it'd be great for water-skiing.

734
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:45,871
Lulu loves water-skiing.

735
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:48,211
She also loves carriage rides.
You're not selling a carriage, are you?

736
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,451
Just the boat, kirk.
You interested or not?

737
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:52,321
- How much we talking?
- $600.

738
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,622
- I was thinking more around $300.
- Price isn't negotiable.

739
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:56,272
- Okay, $400.
- Non-negotiable --

740
00:29:56,306 --> 00:29:59,183
$600 price includes everything,
Kirk, even the trailer.

741
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,393
- $590.
- $600, Kirk.

742
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,510
$595, and you throw in a life
preserver and a captain's hat.

743
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:06,381
$600, you buy your
own captain's hat.

744
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:09,611
- But you'll throw in a life preserver?
- Deal. Just have it out of here A.S.A.P.

745
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,251
Sucker.

746
00:30:13,957 --> 00:30:16,310
Oh, plates and cups
right by the food.

747
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:18,860
Art supplies over at the
onesies table. Thanks.

748
00:30:18,896 --> 00:30:21,721
Hey, Sookie, I forget --
are these edible or soap?

749
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:22,810
Soap.

750
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:25,700
Oh, this is a party favor --
not near the candy pacifiers.

751
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:27,690
Sugar, what do you think?
Is it straight?

752
00:30:27,728 --> 00:30:29,763
It looks great.
Patty, how are you doing?

753
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:31,070
Adorable.

754
00:30:31,107 --> 00:30:33,631
There is nothing cuter
than a baby in a onesie --

755
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,623
except, of course,
Anthony Quinn in a onesie.

756
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:37,802
I'll take your word for it.

757
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,033
- Mom!
- Hey! How'd it go?

758
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:41,972
Why did the baby shower
get moved to miss Patty's?

759
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:44,833
Oh, it's a long story.
Now tell me about the meeting.

760
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:48,271
It was great. It was so great.
But what's going on here?

761
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:50,802
Okay, "great's" not gonna do it.
I need big, juicy details.

762
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:54,150
All right, Lane had contractions.
She went to the hospital,

763
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,833
but it was a false alarm.
She's okay. She is on bed rest.

764
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:57,890
- What?
- I know.

765
00:30:57,928 --> 00:31:02,071
But now tell me from the moment that
the right bald guy smiled at you --

766
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:03,303
- And walk.
- Where are we going?

767
00:31:03,335 --> 00:31:04,300
- How are your shoes?
- My shoes?

768
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:06,053
Good arch support?
Good traction? Good.

769
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:09,163
Slow down. Hold it! Hold it.

770
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:09,972
Too fast.

771
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:11,810
Mom, I'm fine.
Hey, this is fun.

772
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:14,440
Don't they push a bed through the streets
in the opening credits of "the monkees"?

773
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:15,941
I'm pretty sure
it was a bathtub.

774
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,771
Actually it was both -- Davy's in
the bed. Peter's in the bathtub.

775
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:20,250
Are you sure?
'Cause I could have sworn --

776
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:23,070
Zach, you don't want to go head-to-head
with her about "monkees" trivia.

777
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:26,483
You did not come to a full stop!
And use your blinkers!

778
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:28,661
- Okay, we're turning around.
- Okay, hold on, Lane!

779
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:32,101
Hold on. Are you ready?
Here we go.

780
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:35,173
Hold tight. You all right?

781
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,041
Yep. I'm good.

782
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:04,951
Looking good.
You done there, Patty?

783
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm done. How you doing, hon?

784
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:08,330
Oh, doing great.

785
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:11,053
Yeah? I mean about the
whole Christopher thing.

786
00:32:11,088 --> 00:32:15,820
Oh, um... fine, you know,
moving forward, moving on.

787
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:16,991
Good.

788
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:20,601
If you ask me,
Gil's the one to beat.

789
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:22,612
Oh, yeah,
I saw him do that whole thing freehand.

790
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:24,542
He's an amazing man.

791
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,771
As is Kirk.

792
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,261
Don't worry, Lulu.
It's the rock-star thing.

793
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:33,873
Dean Martin singing "mambo italiano" --
I will never forget it.

794
00:32:33,906 --> 00:32:35,953
Oh, great. I need another one.

795
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:37,742
Oh, no, no. What are you doing?

796
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:39,872
Well, I was trying to
make a little truck,

797
00:32:39,906 --> 00:32:42,373
but the flatbed kept
running around to the back.

798
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,900
Well, no do-overs,
so just turn that into something else.

799
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:48,660
I tried to make Snoopy --
figured he's easy to draw,

800
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:50,422
and what kid doesn't
like snoopy, right?

801
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:53,253
Plus, as the added bonus, he's black-and-
white, and the onesie's already white,

802
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:56,563
so I only got to add the black. But it's
looking more like a chocolate-chip cookie --

803
00:32:56,597 --> 00:32:57,550
a big one.

804
00:32:57,585 --> 00:33:00,172
Which is okay,
'cause what kid doesn't like a cookie?

805
00:33:00,597 --> 00:33:02,653
What am I supposed
to turn this into?

806
00:33:02,685 --> 00:33:04,262
I don't know -- a blob?

807
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:07,853
Make it a bunch of blobs --
a baby's first rorschach test.

808
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:10,650
Oh, yeah.
I see a ballerina about to take flight.

809
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:11,871
I see cheese.

810
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,493
See? Something for everyone.

811
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:14,721
All right, have fun.

812
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:18,220
Whoa! This one's homely, man.

813
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:22,410
Look, it's got Zach's giant ears and
Lane's glasses. I feel for that kid.

814
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:24,163
Gonna have a rough life.

815
00:33:24,198 --> 00:33:27,461
But it will probably
help to fuel his music.

816
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:31,480
You know, you got to feel pain
to create the really good stuff.

817
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:33,730
Yeah, this one's
gonna get the chicks,

818
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:35,601
but that one's
gonna be the genius.

819
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:38,101
You know these aren't what Lane and
Zach's kids are gonna look like.

820
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:39,711
It's one of those computer
morphing programs.

821
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:42,472
Yeah, dude. I have kids.
I know how it works.

822
00:33:42,508 --> 00:33:43,852
Thanks for coming.

823
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:47,533
Yo, hello. What's up, guys?

824
00:33:48,657 --> 00:33:51,393
Hi, everyone.
I don't want to interrupt the fun.

825
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:53,463
I just wanted to say
thank you for coming

826
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:56,202
to this somewhat
unconventional baby shower,

827
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:58,102
which is actually perfect,
because when do Lane and Zach

828
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:00,112
ever do anything
that's conventional?

829
00:34:02,338 --> 00:34:06,071
I've known Lane now for --
what has it been? 17 years?

830
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:09,181
And... I'm just sick
of her already.

831
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:13,332
No, actually,
I just love you and Zach so much,

832
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:14,971
and I just can't wait
to meet those boys.

833
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:17,500
So thank you so much for coming.
Keep having fun.

834
00:34:17,536 --> 00:34:20,970
And just eat, drink,
and keep decorating those onesies.

835
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:28,802
Thanks, Rory. This party rocks.

836
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:32,123
It's all due to my mom, though.
I planned, she executed.

837
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,553
Well, you both rock.

838
00:34:33,587 --> 00:34:35,623
Well, how often does a girl's
best friend have twins?

839
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,900
Just once, let's hope.

840
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:38,572
Yeah, no kidding.
You want a drink, babe?

841
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:40,652
- Maybe a lemonade.
- Coming right up.

842
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,111
Seriously, Zach's right.
This party is amazing.

843
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,870
Everything you guys did --

844
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:48,511
truthfully, I didn't think it
was actually gonna happen.

845
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,952
Yes, well, that whole bed-rest
thing really threw a wrench in.

846
00:34:51,986 --> 00:34:53,982
- Plus the fight.
- What fight?

847
00:34:54,015 --> 00:34:55,152
You didn't hear
about the fight?

848
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:57,583
Me and my mom,
classic Kim family grudgefest?

849
00:34:57,615 --> 00:35:01,241
If not for your mom, we might have gone
the way of pretty girls make graves.

850
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:04,431
They were so young and had so
many killer albums left in them.

851
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:06,111
So my mom brokered peace?

852
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:07,491
Hard-core.

853
00:35:07,915 --> 00:35:10,810
Listen... here's the thing.

854
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,110
My kids are gonna need that,
too --

855
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:17,553
You know, when they're hiding
bibles and they can't stand me.

856
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:19,470
So what I wanted to know is...

857
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:22,383
would you be their
Lorelai Gilmore?

858
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:24,862
I guess that's the proper term.

859
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:26,451
Really?

860
00:35:26,846 --> 00:35:29,041
I can't think of anyone
who would be better.

861
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:31,403
Plus, you already
have the name.

862
00:35:32,438 --> 00:35:35,293
- I'd love to. Yeah.
- Thanks.

863
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:42,070
- Here.
- Hi, Mrs. Kim. What's this?

864
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:43,243
Open it.

865
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,800
- It's a doorknob.
- Not just any doorknob --

866
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:48,332
John Adams' doorknob.

867
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,703
You are familiar with our
second president, I assume?

868
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:51,782
Not personally.

869
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,311
- You're making a joke?
- Little one.

870
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:55,272
That's what I thought.
Anyway, I'm glad to be here,

871
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:57,200
- and I wanted you to know that.
- Hence the doorknob.

872
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:58,452
- Yes.
- Thank you.

873
00:35:58,485 --> 00:36:00,502
Don't tarnish it,
or its value will decrease.

874
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:01,791
Okay.

875
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:05,131
- Do you have my pictures?
- I left them at home.

876
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,422
- I'll drop them off tomorrow.
- You do that.

877
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:14,691
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, you.

878
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:16,251
Way to go. It's a great party.

879
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:18,743
It is, right? I could have used
another gift table, though.

880
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,332
Yeah, somebody went crazy.

881
00:36:20,365 --> 00:36:21,843
I wouldn't say "crazy."

882
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:23,793
Wait -- that's all from us?

883
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:25,343
Well, I felt bad.

884
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,861
I had already promised them all of
our old stuff from Martha and Davey,

885
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:30,592
- and then I had to renege.
- So they get all new stuff,

886
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:33,901
and we have to keep the crappy hand-me-
downs? How does that make any sense?!

887
00:36:33,937 --> 00:36:36,000
Whose fault is this, huh?

888
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,481
Nice talking to you.
See you later.

889
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:40,310
Ahoy, Lorelai.

890
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,883
Yeah, Kirk.
What's with the hat?

891
00:36:41,918 --> 00:36:44,342
Oh, this? No big deal.
Just bought myself a boat.

892
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:46,932
- A boat?
- Yeah, the S.S. Lurk.

893
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:50,183
It's a combination of my name and
Luke's since it used to be his boat.

894
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:51,543
Oh, you bought Luke's boat.

895
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:54,103
Yeah, she needs a little more
work before she's seaworthy,

896
00:36:54,135 --> 00:36:56,421
but as soon as she is,
I'll take you out.

897
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:58,803
You can be Ginger
to Lulu's Mary Ann.

898
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:00,193
Let's lock down dates now.

899
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:01,441
- When are you free?
- Mom.

900
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:03,882
Oh, well,
we'll figure it out later. Bye.

901
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:12,430
Perfect timing. You save me from a
three-hour tour of the S.S. Lurk.

902
00:37:12,468 --> 00:37:13,182
The what?

903
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:15,243
Kirk bought Luke's old boat.

904
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:16,673
Does he even have
a driver's licence?

905
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:17,500
I don't think so.

906
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,713
- I'm staying out of the water.
- Good kid.

907
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:22,730
Why didn't you tell me about
the whole drama with Mrs. Kim?

908
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:24,821
Honey, you had your meeting.
You were nervous enough already.

909
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:26,091
Yeah, I was, wasn't I?

910
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,470
You got the whole brunt of
that freak-out. I'm so sorry.

911
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,700
That's okay.
So, do you think it went well?

912
00:37:30,735 --> 00:37:32,382
I do,
I think it went really well.

913
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,532
I mean,
the reston fellowship is a long shot.

914
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:37,172
They only pick four people out of the
whole country, and that's including

915
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:39,082
college seniors and
graduate students.

916
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:40,751
So? You and three other people.

917
00:37:40,787 --> 00:37:43,820
Yeah, but can you imagine it? I would
be an intern at the New York Times.

918
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:46,320
- I'd be up for bylines.
- I can imagine it.

919
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:49,371
I don't want to get my hopes up,
so I'm not even gonna think about it.

920
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:51,532
- Can I think about it?
- Yes, but not around me.

921
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:53,942
Deal. So,
when is Logan getting here?

922
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:56,910
- Oh. He's not.
- Why?

923
00:37:56,948 --> 00:38:01,593
Um... it's a long story. I guess there
was this huge disaster at his work.

924
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,120
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

925
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,390
I guess the company he
bought is being sued,

926
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:07,861
and he's losing all kinds of money --
not only his own money,

927
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:10,530
his dad's money.
It's awful, and he feels awful.

928
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:13,031
At least that explains
why he's acting awful.

929
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:14,181
What do you mean?

930
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:18,171
Well, right now, he's on a private
jet to Vegas with Colin and Finn.

931
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:21,792
"Got kicked out of Argentina with
the bush twins" Colin and Finn?

932
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:23,772
So sorry. You okay?

933
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:27,503
Yeah, I'm fine. I just wish that
he'd told me about this earlier,

934
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:30,170
that I'd known it was going on.
Maybe I could have helped.

935
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:32,331
Honey, I don't think there's
anything you could have done.

936
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:34,730
Yeah, I know,
but maybe I could have tried, you know?

937
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:38,963
And now he just took off, which -- I
get it. He needs to blow off some steam,

938
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:41,303
but I just wish he could
have come to the party.

939
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:43,333
It would have meant so much to me.
He could have met everyone.

940
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:44,553
I know.

941
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:46,952
But I'm sure we'll
figure it out.

942
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,530
Oh, hey, Lane asked me to be
her Lorelai Gilmore to her kids,

943
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:52,000
like you were to her.

944
00:38:52,037 --> 00:38:53,190
Yeah.

945
00:38:53,675 --> 00:38:55,013
Big shoes to fill.

946
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:57,472
Well, luckily,
we have similar feet.

947
00:38:59,045 --> 00:38:59,970
What?

948
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,262
Oh, it's nothing.

949
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:02,401
Come on.

950
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,570
I just think my first pancake
turned out pretty darn good.

951
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:10,393
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

952
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:11,352
That's all right.

953
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,493
I was wondering if we should
bring the cake out now,

954
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:15,921
because Lane's got that
low-blood-sugar look in her eye.

955
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,522
Oh, yeah, let's do it.

956
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:28,130
Seems like yesterday she was taking
up three tables at the diner

957
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:29,820
with those giant books of hers.

958
00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:32,952
Yep. She was something.

959
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:34,871
Is something.

960
00:39:37,516 --> 00:39:41,440
So, what's this I hear
about Kirk buying your boat?

961
00:39:41,475 --> 00:39:45,690
Oh, well... I just realized I was
never gonna take that thing out.

962
00:39:45,727 --> 00:39:48,983
I mean, all that time I
spent trying to fix it up...

963
00:39:49,645 --> 00:39:51,892
So I bought a new one.

964
00:39:52,805 --> 00:39:53,683
When?

965
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:56,111
Today -- got the idea in my
head a couple hours ago,

966
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:59,250
went down to the shipyard in Bridgeport,
and just did it.

967
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:00,393
You just bought a boat.

968
00:40:00,425 --> 00:40:03,003
Yeah, and it's even bigger
and better than the old one.

969
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:05,880
It's got everything.
It's got a little kitchen,

970
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,842
a bathroom,
even a place to sleep.

971
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,262
- Wow.
- I'm gonna keep it in the marina.

972
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:12,660
And then when April comes
to visit in the summer,

973
00:40:12,698 --> 00:40:15,961
take it out on little trips,
go away for a few weeks.

974
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:18,270
- Luke, that sounds really nice.
- Right?

975
00:40:19,118 --> 00:40:21,682
God, I can't believe you
bought a boat in a day.

976
00:40:21,715 --> 00:40:23,783
It used to take you a
week to buy a t-shirt.

977
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:26,021
Yeah, well, things change.

978
00:40:30,206 --> 00:40:31,541
I'll see you inside?

979
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:37,143
All right, everyone,
here comes cake!

980
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:40,320
Ready, fellas.
One, two, three, four...

981
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:44,330
# Hush, little baby,
don't say a word #

982
00:40:44,397 --> 00:40:47,230
# Papa's gonna buy
you a mockingbird #

983
00:40:47,296 --> 00:40:50,211
# And if that
mockingbird don't sing #

984
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:53,140
# Papa's gonna buy
you a diamond ring #

985
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:56,131
# And if that diamond
ring turns brass #

986
00:40:56,197 --> 00:40:58,981
# Papa's gonna buy
you a looking glass #

987
00:40:59,046 --> 00:41:01,853
