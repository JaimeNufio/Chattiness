1
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,703
- Are you serious? 
- I am serious.

2
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:07,290
We can really rehearse in your garage?

3
00:01:07,383 --> 00:01:10,143
In exchange for the promise that you never pose naked

4
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:13,148
on the cover of Rolling Stone no matter how much trouble your career is in.

5
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,823
I promise. I love you.

6
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:16,246
Do you know how amazing your mother is?

7
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:18,669
No. Tell her, would ya? She forgot this morning.

8
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:21,280
Because hot water is enjoyed by all, not just by you.

9
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:22,472
I wasn’t in the shower that long.

10
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:24,562
Man, it’s winter carnival time again already.

11
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,175
Are you going?

12
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:29,171
I have to. We are raising money for the marching band this year,

13
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:30,650
mandatory booth manning is involved.

14
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:33,000
Man, Lane – marching band, rock band.

15
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:33,916
Music is my life.

16
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,962
Hi Mrs. Kim!

17
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:36,702
So not funny.

18
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:38,612
Raising money for the marching band to do what?

19
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,691
Please let it be new uniforms.

20
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:43,123
It’s for letters so we can finally have letter carriers.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,062
For some reason, the powers that be think that the reason we never win at competitions

22
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,089
is because no one knows who we are. The fact that we suck has never occurred to them.

23
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:50,501
What’s wrong with our uniforms?

24
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,327
Nothing.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,564
- We look stupid, right? 
- No.

26
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,153
The plumes are too big, and it looks like

27
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:55,826
big red fountains of blood spurting out of our heads.

28
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:56,973
I love the uniforms.

29
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:58,713
It’s bad enough I have to be in marching band at all

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,666
without being mocked for what is mandatory for us to wear.

31
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:02,104
No, no, no, I didn’t mean...

32
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:04,894
remind her that she gets to rehearse in our garage

33
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:06,328
‘cause I think I’m losing points here.

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,001
Your uniforms are great, and people knowing who you are can only help.

35
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,598
Now let’s just enjoy the snow, okay?

36
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:14,342
Especially since some of us have been freezing since our showers this morning.

37
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,797
I wasn’t in there that long.

38
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,317
I’m sorry, can we get back to the band uniforms,

39
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:18,601
‘cause on a scale of one to ten,

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,768
how much do I not wanna let Dave see me like that?

41
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:22,903
- Ten. 
- Okay, thanks.

42
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:21,908
To evaluate the value of a function of X when X equals pi.

43
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:24,376
You want to start by splitting the intregal into two separate intregals.

44
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,649
Now, since the left intregal is a variable of a constant exponent,

45
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,912
remember C is a constant, add one and divide by the new power.

46
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:30,904
Paris, what did he say?

47
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:33,368
He’s talking too fast, I missed it.

48
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:34,791
Ask Louise.

49
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:37,771
- Louise, what did he say? 
- I don’t know, ask Paris.

50
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,005
She told me to ask you.

51
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:40,716
- Why would she do that? 
- I don’t know.

52
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:42,328
Did you guys have a fight?

53
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,593
Not that I know of.

54
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:45,800
The right intregal, however, is more complex.

55
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:49,055
You have to use U substitution with U equals 3 feet.

56
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,320
We’ll pick up at the same place tomorrow.

57
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:56,751
- The bell rang. 
- What?

58
00:03:56,894 --> 00:03:58,943
The bell? That loud metal musical contraption

59
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,360
that when hit loudly by a vibrating mallet signals the end

60
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:03,556
of this particular educational experience.

61
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,035
- Class is over? 
- Yup.

62
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,955
- What did he talk about? 
- Ask Louise.

63
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:10,838
I didn’t take notes. I didn’t pay attention. I’m going to...

64
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:12,225
Borrow my notes and be just fine.

65
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:13,030
Thank you.

66
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:14,596
Madeline want notes, too, please.

67
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:18,139
Add one and divide by the new power?

68
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:21,556
Oh, I thought it said add one and divide by the Jew power.

69
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:23,307
It makes much more sense this way.

70
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:25,647
I can’t believe I zoned out for the entire class.

71
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:26,419
You must have a lot on your mind.

72
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,510
- I do. 
- I’m sure.

73
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:29,466
Okay, so, onto the next thing.

74
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:31,048
I don’t think I’ll have the prom bids ready

75
00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:33,029
for the supplemental student council meeting this week.

76
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:35,723
They need a little more time to get the details together,

77
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,618
so that leaves a little hole in our agenda.

78
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:38,727
Any thoughts?

79
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,995
Well, we can just cancel the supplementary meeting this week.

80
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:43,019
What?

81
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,099
Well, if there’s nothing really to talk about, what’s the point, right?

82
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:48,001
You said that one student council meeting a week was not enough.

83
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:50,639
Yeah, you said that was no way to govern,

84
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,470
that meeting once a week was lazy, ineffectual,

85
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:54,743
and if we were going to do it like that,

86
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:56,891
we might as well just buy ourselves a ranch in Texas.

87
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:59,169
Fine, if you guys wanna sit around for an hour after school

88
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:01,524
swapping makeover horror stories, then count me in.

89
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,392
 Hey, did I ever tell you about the time I plucked outside

90
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:07,110
of my designated brow line? Man, was my face red.

91
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:08,882
I’ve done that, too. Ooh, it’s bad.

92
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,260
She was being sarcastic.

93
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,682
Well, I wasn’t. I looked surprised for a month.

94
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:13,721
We’ll just take this week off,

95
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:15,514
and next week we’ll go back to twice a week, okay?

96
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:17,084
- Sounds fair. 
- Sounds fab.

97
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:20,556
I heard something about the supplemental student council meeting –

98
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:23,475
anything I need to know about, a new chart to be made, perhaps?

99
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,261
No. We were just saying that the agenda seems light this week,

100
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:27,443
so I’ve decided to cancel it,

101
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,557
and we can just gather at the regular meeting on Friday.

102
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,662
Wow, this is quite a change in plans.

103
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:32,794
You have a problem with it?

104
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:34,007
No, I’m just surprised.

105
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:35,743
You seem so attached to those meetings.

106
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,956
Well, I finally got a blankie. It’s much better.

107
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,105
Okay, no extra meeting this week.

108
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,609
What will I do with all that extra time?

109
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,575
Well, I guess I’ll think of something.

110
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,629
Take a picture of which outfit wins, will ya?

111
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:48,061
Bye Francie.

112
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:48,979
Bye.

113
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,593
- I met his parents. 
- You did?

114
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:55,724
He bought me a ticket, and I took the train to Philadelphia,

115
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,405
and he met me at the station, and I spent Christmas with him and his family.

116
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,284
- Sounds nice. 
- No, not nice.

117
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,685
It was perfect. They had a Christmas tree twelve feet tall.

118
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:06,306
Everything was red and silver and there was eggnog.

119
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:08,217
- Have you ever had eggnog? 
- Yes, I have.

120
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:09,731
- It’s disgusting. 
- Yes, it is.

121
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:11,831
But disgusting in a really great way.

122
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,615
And they had tiny wreaths hanging from every doorknob,

123
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:16,567
and mistletoe and candles everywhere.

124
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:19,491
I couldn’t believe it. I mean, I’ve never had a Christmas before.

125
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,000
One year, I asked my mother if we could get a Chanukah bush.

126
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,797
She made me watch Shoah the rest of the week.

127
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,787
The place smelled like cinnamon all the time,

128
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,864
and there was a fire in the fireplace, and a ton of presents.

129
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:31,600
I mean, hundreds of presents.

130
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:34,089
I’m looking at this mound of gifts, and I’m thinking,

131
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,385
‘Eight days of Chanukah...

132
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:37,483
who was the skinflint who thought up that deal?’

133
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:39,634
Don’t the eight days symbolize something?

134
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:42,281
Yes, they symbolize eight days of ripping off the little kids

135
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:44,402
- who can’t have a Chanukah bush. 
- You’re making me sad.

136
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:46,567
- His mother bought me a present. 
- Well, that says something.

137
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:47,442
What does it say?

138
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:49,285
It says that Jamie likes you enough

139
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:51,431
that she felt compelled to buy you a present.

140
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:52,727
I had the most amazing time.

141
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:54,564
Sitting around the tree opening presents,

142
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:57,156
and they played Christmas music and we drank apple cider...

143
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:58,600
it was so nice.

144
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,647
And then his grandfather and I wound up in a theological discussion.

145
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:05,691
Jesus – Messiah or nice Jewish kid with a hammer? It got pretty heated.

146
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:08,206
Okay, skip to the end, I can’t take it. How did it turn out?

147
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:10,674
- He told me he loved me. 
- Aw, Paris!

148
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:13,106
I never thought I’d hear a boy tell me he loved me.

149
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:14,109
That’s great.

150
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,619
He invited me back up for Easter break.

151
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:16,612
You’re going, I assume?

152
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:17,438
Are you kidding?

153
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:19,792
And miss a chance to debate Christ rising from the dead?

154
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:22,087
- I’m so there. 
- Jamie’s a lucky man.

155
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:33,044
- Move, please. 
- Whoa, what’s going on?

156
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,190
I cannot talk now, please.

157
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,886
Michel, they sound really angry.

158
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:36,921
They do, don’t they?

159
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:38,358
- What did you say? 
- I don’t know.

160
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,312
What do you mean you don’t know?

161
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,416
All you had to say was ‘Welcome to Stars Hollow,’ that’s it.

162
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:42,809
I know, I thought I did,

163
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:45,251
and then they got angry and threw breadsticks and butter pats.

164
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:47,878
- Michel. 
- I’m looking.

165
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,280
You only had to say one word in Hungarian...

166
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:52,022
welcome, that’s it. How bad could it be?

167
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,413
Very bad.

168
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:56,045
- Oh, Michel. 
- Very, very bad.

169
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,043
Be careful.

170
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,274
Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.

171
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:04,134
Well, your father’s sixtieth birthday dinner is back on.

172
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:05,446
What sixtieth birthday dinner?

173
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:07,607
The one that I had planned for Wednesday night.

174
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,938
Oh, were we coming?

175
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:11,063
Of course you were coming. You think you wouldn’t be invited?

176
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,859
Apparently, we weren’t invited.

177
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:14,739
I had just started planning the whole thing

178
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,019
when he came home in a mood

179
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,580
and declared that parties were for children and it was canceled.

180
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:19,639
Were we disappointed?

181
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:21,830
However, today he came in and changed his mind,

182
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:23,653
so I expect the two of you at eight.

183
00:08:23,864 --> 00:08:26,716
And bring a gift, but don’t get him a cigar humidor.

184
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:27,388
Okay.

185
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:28,693
I bought him a cigar humidor.

186
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:29,763
I assumed.

187
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:31,002
It’s gorgeous.

188
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:34,166
It belonged to a lieutenant in the army in World War I.

189
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,798
Apparently, he kept it in his field office in France.

190
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,426
There are carvings in the bottom

191
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,534
that the dealer said could possibly be coded messages.

192
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,249
- Cool. 
- I think so, too.

193
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,400
All right, eight o’clock, do not be late.

194
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,725
Okay, we will not be late. Bye. - Well?

195
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,756
It’s fine. All we have to do is pay the ransom

196
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:52,604
and they will give us the busboy back.

197
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:04,182
Come in.

198
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,326
- Dean, hi. 
- Hi.

199
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:09,531
I hope I’m not disturbing anything.

200
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:10,771
Oh, no, absolutely not.

201
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,049
Good. Um, I just wanted to...

202
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:13,326
What?

203
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,006
- Don’t kick the cup. 
- The what?

204
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,403
I have a spider whose previous credits include the bathtub scene

205
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:19,425
from Annie Hall trapped under that cup.

206
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:21,043
- The size of a Buick? 
- Yeah.

207
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:24,089
I see. And what are you planning to do now that you’ve got him trapped?

208
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:25,876
Well, I was thinking of just giving him the kitchen.

209
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:28,345
‘Cause, you know, we don’t use it very much anyhow, so...

210
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:29,927
I could get rid of it if you want.

211
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,138
Yeah, that’d be great. Just, careful...

212
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,570
He heard me talking, so don’t let him get away.

213
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:36,834
He knows I’m behind this, he’ll come after me.

214
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,361
I guess you can see why camping’s completely out of the question for me.

215
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:42,774
- Got it. 
- Okay, great.

216
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,001
- Could ya... 
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

217
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:47,228
Don’t let his family see you. Spiders are vindictive.

218
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:49,774
- Mom? 
- Rory.

219
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:53,260
Can we do pizza tonight? I’ve got a ton of studying to do.

220
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,458
Sure, pizza sounds great.

221
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,367
Good. Why’s the door open?

222
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,802
The door is open because...

223
00:09:58,227 --> 00:09:59,067
Dean’s here.

224
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:05,098
Dean threw out a spider for me.

225
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:08,253
I just came by to drop off some of your stuff.

226
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,735
Just some books you loaned me, a couple of CD’s.

227
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:12,734
Okay, thanks.

228
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:13,691
Yeah, sure.

229
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,203
Okay, so, I’m gonna go.

230
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,453
Thanks Dean.

231
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,851
It was a really big spider.

232
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:24,535
I think it had a gun.

233
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:27,403
What are you feeling right now?

234
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:28,206
Nothing.

235
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:30,014
Not weirded out, even a little?

236
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,017
Why would I be weirded out?

237
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:33,025
Well, Dean coming over, bringing your stuff back.

238
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:34,197
No, I’m fine.

239
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:37,166
Okay. Although, you know, if you were weirded out a little,

240
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:39,143
it would be okay.

241
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,771
It wouldn’t mean that you don’t like Jess, or that you made a mistake.

242
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:45,109
It would just mean the guy who was in your life for two years isn’t there anymore.

243
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,542
I was just surprised, that’s all.

244
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:48,647
- If you say so. 
- I do.

245
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,572
I’m gonna go start studying.

246
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:52,446
- I’ll order the pizza. 
- Thank you.

247
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,107
You know what just occurred to me?

248
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:26,970
That we are very fortunate to have good teeth.

249
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:28,081
Yes, very fortunate.

250
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:34,327
Can you imagine if braces were involved in this interaction?

251
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:35,373
It’d be a bloodbath.

252
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:39,464
I can’t catch my breath.

253
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,653
You’re not supposed to.

254
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,311
Hey, listen,

255
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,722
Thursday night is the Stars Hollow High Winter Carnival.

256
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:45,373
Oh yeah?

257
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:47,058
Yeah, I thought we could go, meet Lane there.

258
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:47,739
Nope.

259
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:49,331
But it’d be really fun.

260
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:52,690
They’ll have really bad games and really bad food

261
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:54,631
and the marching band will play and...

262
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,453
Rory, I’m doing some of my best work here

263
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:58,036
and you’re just talking right through it.

264
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,685
Come on, let’s go to the carnival.

265
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:01,717
I don’t go to these stupid town things.

266
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:03,960
You went to the Bid-A-Basket festival.

267
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,203
You went to the dance marathon.

268
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:07,012
That was when I was trying to get you. I now have you.

269
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,108
That means I don’t have to go anymore.

270
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:09,372
- You’re serious? 
- As a heart attack.

271
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:10,489
But it’ll be fun.

272
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,343
We can have our own fun.

273
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:15,267
- I can’t miss the winter carnival. 
- Rory, come on.

274
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:18,672
Well, I never have. I can’t.

275
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:20,970
Just go with me, please.

276
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:24,652
Look, how ‘bout you go to the festival, meet Lane,

277
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,152
and then I’ll hook up with you afterwards.

278
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:27,704
That’s my final offer, man.

279
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:28,738
- Fine. 
- Fine.

280
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:33,285
We’re gonna walk right in front of a car one of these days.

281
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:38,640
So, you want some help with your homework?

282
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:39,547
You’re going to help me?

283
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:41,927
Don’t take this the wrong way, but how?

284
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,249
Come upstairs and I’ll show you.

285
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:44,150
- Upstairs? 
- Yeah.

286
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:46,203
You know how important my education is to me.

287
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,309
Yes, I do.

288
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:49,674
Rory, hey. Thank God, I need help.

289
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,288
- Where you going? 
- Nowhere.

290
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,180
See ya.

291
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,785
Were you guys gonna go upstairs and kiss?

292
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:56,106
Wow, look at all the bags.

293
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,570
Yes, I went shopping for my father’s birthday present today,

294
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:00,376
which was great for about fifteen minutes,

295
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:02,322
- until it all came back to me. 
- What?

296
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,739
The fact that I totally suck at buying my father presents.

297
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,188
He’ll like whatever you get him.

298
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,237
If I slip him a quaalude, he’ll like whatever I get him.

299
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,152
They are not that bad.

300
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,478
My intentions are always good,

301
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,281
and I never put a price limit on it.

302
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:14,856
I even went so far as to follow older men around the store

303
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:16,505
who kind of looked like my dad to see what they were buying,

304
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:19,573
which didn’t help me with ideas, but I did get asked to the antique car show.

305
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,366
- Just show me what you got. 
- Fine.

306
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:24,110
Option number one –

307
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,776
a state of the art, high tech, titanium bathroom scale.

308
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:30,509
What? He has weight.

309
00:13:30,698 --> 00:13:33,981
Yes, but I’m not sure that his birthday is the time to remind him of it.

310
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,768
Okay, option number two –

311
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:43,218
a fabulous mechanical coin sorter.

312
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:45,301
You put the coins in, it sorts ‘em.

313
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:46,659
What?

314
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:49,582
Well, it’s a little generic.

315
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,800
Generic in a good way, or...

316
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:51,856
What’s the third option?

317
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:53,971
See, I should have pulled the coin sorter out last, ‘cause...

318
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:54,785
- Mom. 
- Okay.

319
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:59,377
- A tie. 
- Yes, it’s silk.

320
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,462
- It’s nice. 
- It is?

321
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,862
- What’s that? 
- It’s a tie for my father’s birthday.

322
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,592
- What, no Aramis this year? 
- No, he likes ties.

323
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:07,954
You know, if you get the big bottle,

324
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,816
it usually comes with a tote bag and a soap on a rope.

325
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:11,759
Go away.

326
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:15,174
- My gifts suck. 
- It’s the thought that counts.

327
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,720
- What’d you get him? 
- Nothing big.

328
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:17,882
- Well, what? 
- Just a thing.

329
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:20,612
- What kind of thing? 
- Chuck Berry Live at the Fillmore on vinyl.

330
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:22,639
Oh my God, that’s perfect.

331
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:24,390
He loves Chuck Berry. How did you come up with that?

332
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:25,866
I called him and asked him what he wanted.

333
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,120
- That’s cheating. 
- Tough.

334
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:28,876
Well, now what am I gonna do?

335
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:31,651
I can’t give him a tie when you give him the world’s most perfect present

336
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:32,854
we already know he likes.

337
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:34,416
You want me to go find something for you?

338
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:35,446
You would do that?

339
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:36,951
He gave me a couple other suggestions.

340
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:38,395
I can go see if I can find one of them.

341
00:14:38,564 --> 00:14:41,272
My God, I love you. You are my angel.

342
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,504
Hey, you had one more that you didn’t show me.

343
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:46,136
Oh, yeah – it lights up and sings.

344
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,161
Enough said.

345
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:57,196
Oh, sorry.

346
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,618
- I didn’t see you. 
- I wasn’t paying attention.

347
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:01,155
I was just looking in the window and then...

348
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:02,874
I was just noticing the new benches in the square.

349
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,616
- Sorry. 
- Yeah, sorry.

350
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,794
- It’s weird. 
- What’s weird?

351
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,560
How we keep randomly bumping into each other like this.

352
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:14,927
It wasn’t exactly random bumping into you at your house.

353
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,510
Right, I live there, not so random.

354
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:18,001
Though, this, right now...

355
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:19,357
- Random. 
- Very random.

356
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,317
That’s probably the most the word random’s been used

357
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,032
in a two minutes period in a really long time.

358
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:27,697
Hey, you wanna get a cup of coffee?

359
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:29,597
- Coffee? 
- Maybe talk a little?

360
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,157
Of course, if you prefer, we can both just head over to Weston’s

361
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:34,922
and randomly bump into each other.

362
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,790
No, that’s okay. I can get coffee.

363
00:15:38,242 --> 00:15:38,906
Good.

364
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,761
So, where do you wanna sit?

365
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:48,901
There’s good, if you like the window.

366
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:50,283
Window is fine.

367
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:51,964
Of course, there’s that one if you don’t like the window.

368
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:52,962
Window’s fine.

369
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,272
The window can be colder because of the glass,

370
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,595
but then that one is right by the bathroom,

371
00:15:57,774 --> 00:16:00,668
and being right by the bathroom always makes me kind of uncomfortable,

372
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,631
which isn’t really fair because something has to be right by the bathroom.

373
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,661
Otherwise, you’re cutting down on tables,

374
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,292
which means you’re cutting down on profits and...

375
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,765
- window’s fine? 
- Window’s fine.

376
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,071
Let’s sit down then.

377
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,454
This is a very nice table.

378
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,493
Good pick.

379
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:24,626
Today we have an almond tort, an apple pandowdy,

380
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:28,537
and various marzipan fruits made by a sect of cloistered nuns in Toledo.

381
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,216
I’ll have a piece of pie.

382
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:32,900
Cherry, peach, chocolate, pumpkin, custard...

383
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:34,324
- Custard’s fine. 
- There’s more.

384
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:35,916
I know, but custard’s fine.

385
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:36,955
You don’t wanna hear the rest?

386
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:38,733
I am really good with the custard.

387
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,805
But they made memorize thirty different flavors.

388
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:41,639
- Kirk? 
- Yes?

389
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:42,721
Custard is fine.

390
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,396
- You want ice cream with that? 
- Are there different flavors?

391
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,947
- Thirty-two. 
- Just the pie.

392
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:47,801
Okay. What about you?

393
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:49,259
Oh, nothing for me.

394
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:50,662
- Nothing? 
- I’m not hungry.

395
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,235
- You’re not hungry? 
- Nope, I’m not.

396
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,512
- She’s not hungry. 
- I’ll be right back.

397
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,742
In all the time I’ve known you, I’ve never seen you not hungry.

398
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,150
Yeah, well...

399
00:17:01,113 --> 00:17:02,065
Thanks for doing this.

400
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,161
Of course. Why wouldn’t I?

401
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:05,081
Because you’re incredibly uncomfortable.

402
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:08,021
Well, it’s the situation, not you.

403
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,962
Yeah, the situation.

404
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,133
You know, with you and me being...

405
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,144
Yeah, I know the situation.

406
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:19,874
So... how are ya?

407
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:21,241
I’m fine.

408
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:24,293
- You? 
- I’m doing okay.

409
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:26,602
- How’s school? 
- Not bad.

410
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,138
I’ve got McKellan for History.

411
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:31,390
Oh, has he done his Napoleon having dinner with Charlemagne bit yet?

412
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:33,315
Catherine the Great shows up for dessert.

413
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,952
Oh, wow, he’s revised it. Good for him.

414
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,497
He’s a unique man, but a decent teacher.

415
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,681
You know...

416
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:45,680
I wanted to tell you I applied to Southern Connecticut State.

417
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:46,519
What?

418
00:17:46,636 --> 00:17:48,732
McKellan actually wrote me a letter of recommendation.

419
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:50,002
Wait a minute – you do know

420
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:52,024
that Southern Connecticut State is a four-year college?

421
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:53,862
Yeah, I read that in the brochure.

422
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,844
But what happened to ‘I’m going to community college’?

423
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,594
- I changed my mind. 
- Why?

424
00:17:57,857 --> 00:17:59,791
- You. 
- Me?

425
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,025
All your Harvard talk,

426
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,880
all those crazy books you pushed on me,

427
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:04,779
all that talk about ‘you can do more.’

428
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,231
- You can do more. 
- So I decided to do more.

429
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:09,546
- Wow, I’m so glad. 
- Thanks.

430
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:10,973
Well, if you need any help with anything,

431
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:13,315
I’ve become the Rain Man of college application requirements.

432
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:15,275
Thanks. I might take you up on that.

433
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:17,221
Custard pie, no ice cream.

434
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:18,306
Thanks, Kirk.

435
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:21,800
Wow. Southern Connecticut State, that’s exciting.

436
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:23,310
When did all this happen?

437
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:24,866
The last few weeks.

438
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,180
It’s funny. I got the envelope,

439
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:28,988
and I wanted to call you,

440
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:30,760
and then I realized...

441
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:35,594
- I can’t do that. 
- You could’ve done that.

442
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,555
I guess.

443
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:39,217
I don’t know, I can’t get over how weird it is.

444
00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:41,692
- I go from seeing you everyday to... 
- I know.

445
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,852
- I mean, I’m used to talking to you. 
- I know.

446
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:46,070
- That’s a hard thing to just let go of. 
- For me, too.

447
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,046
I don’t know, Rory. Maybe...

448
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:49,470
Maybe...

449
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:54,549
Is there a way we could be friends?

450
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,494
- Really? 
- If you want to.

451
00:18:56,622 --> 00:18:57,877
Oh, I want to.

452
00:18:58,557 --> 00:18:59,576
I really want to.

453
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:02,409
- But... 
- Don’t ask me

454
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,476
how I’m gonna deal with him. I have no idea.

455
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:07,053
Let’s just take this one step at a time.

456
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,091
Absolutely. Slow and steady wins the race.

457
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,243
This is really good.

458
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:11,784
You sure you don’t want a bite?

459
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:13,013
One bite.

460
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:16,724
So how’s Clara’s horseback-riding lessons going?

461
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:20,544
Not bad. I think she actually got within three feet of the thing last week.

462
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,925
- Very impressive. 
- She thought so.

463
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,620
This man is a genius. Listen to him play.

464
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,844
I’m glad you like it, Grandpa.

465
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:31,414
Oh, I must say, I am a very spoiled man.

466
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:35,722
Chuck Berry, and the complete history of the Peloponnesian War.

467
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:39,674
Well, sure, ‘cause a partial history would skip all the dirty stuff.

468
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:43,034
I especially like the way you wrapped the books in a bow tie.

469
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:44,088
It’s very, very clever.

470
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,583
I thought it would be appropriate.

471
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:47,810
And, of course, you’re not forgetting your favorite gift.

472
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,847
Oh, yes, my beautiful humidor from my beautiful wife.

473
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:51,748
Thank you.

474
00:19:51,952 --> 00:19:53,150
No, thank you.

475
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:54,984
It’s been a wonderful birthday.

476
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:57,806
Would you like some more champagne?

477
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,146
Oh, why not?

478
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,684
One of the porch lights is burned out.

479
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,640
Perhaps the simple act of glancing outside a window

480
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,644
once in awhile might have alerted someone to the situation.

481
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:09,489
Gran?

482
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:10,791
Trix, is that you?

483
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:13,674
Well, I’ll be. What a surprise.

484
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,153
Mom, did you know Grandma was coming?

485
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:16,541
Oh my God.

486
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,193
Okay, no seems like a safe answer.

487
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:20,063
Emily, come here!

488
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:23,150
Come say hello to this delightful creature that just walked in.

489
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:24,036
Oh my God.

490
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,294
Come on, let’s see if she tries to make a break for it.

491
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:29,592
Emily, did you know about this?

492
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:31,778
- Why, no, I didn’t. 
- Well, I’m floored.

493
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:32,781
Good.

494
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:36,437
- Hello Lorelai. 
- Hello Gran, good to see you.

495
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,768
- You’re well? 
- I’m well.

496
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:38,747
- You’re working? 
- I’m working.

497
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:40,253
- You’re single? 
- I’m single.

498
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,223
By choice, or do you scare the men with your independence?

499
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:46,063
Actually, I scare them with my Minnie Pearl impression.

500
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:47,288
The lady with the hat.

501
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:49,581
Rory, as soon as I get settled,

502
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,117
I want to hear all about your schooling and your college plans.

503
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:53,044
Okay, Gran.

504
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:56,801
Emily, I don’t know if you realize it or not,

505
00:20:56,903 --> 00:21:00,277
but it’s not proper to receive guests in the foyer.

506
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:03,996
It puts one in the awkward position of having to invite oneself in.

507
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,483
Yes, please, I’m sorry. Please, come in.

508
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:07,412
This way.

509
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,075
- What is she doing here? 
- She’s visiting.

510
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:13,723
She didn’t call, she always calls.

511
00:21:14,031 --> 00:21:16,213
Oh, it’s Dad’s birthday. She wanted it to be a surprise.

512
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,420
But I haven’t prepared. I haven’t shopped or set up the guest room and –

513
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,117
oh God, her horrible gifts are still in the basement.

514
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:22,617
- What do I do? 
- Leave ‘em there.

515
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:23,474
But...

516
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,424
It’s too late to do anything about that now. Come on.

517
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,593
Oh, Emily, you’re still here.

518
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:31,103
Yes, of course I’m still here.

519
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:32,634
Can I get you some champagne?

520
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,325
Well, if you wish me to be violently ill tomorrow, absolutely.

521
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:37,405
Do not answer that.

522
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:39,771
I’ve got you covered Trix.

523
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:42,612
Now, tell me what on earth you’re doing here.

524
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:45,051
You didn’t travel all the way from England just for my birthday.

525
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:47,732
I think your birthday is a good enough reason

526
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:49,356
to travel all the way from England.

527
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:53,397
However, it did also happen to coincide with some business I needed to attend to.

528
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:55,337
- What kind of business? 
- For the past year,

529
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,766
I’ve been renting my home in Hartford to a group of musicians.

530
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,411
They’ve recently moved out,

531
00:22:00,504 --> 00:22:03,679
so I had to come check on the house and secure a new tenant.

532
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,692
What kind of musicians?

533
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,765
A rock and roll group of some sort.

534
00:22:06,873 --> 00:22:08,624
I believe they call themselves Korn.

535
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:10,335
You rented your house to Korn?

536
00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:11,532
That’s so cool!

537
00:22:11,682 --> 00:22:14,287
They were fine tenants. Took wonderful care of the place.

538
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,755
They planted some lovely tulips in the front yard.

539
00:22:16,873 --> 00:22:18,640
So, Mom, if you’re going to be here for awhile,

540
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:22,096
I can plan some things for you to do, some outings you might enjoy.

541
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:23,980
- Like what? 
- Like the arboretum.

542
00:22:24,103 --> 00:22:27,313
I have no desire to spend the entire day with plants, Emily.

543
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:28,395
I’m not a bee.

544
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:31,517
Besides, I already know what I would like to do.

545
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,159
I would like to see where Lorelai works.

546
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,250
The inn?

547
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:36,663
I thought we could all have dinner there.

548
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:38,850
Oh, well, sure. That would be great.

549
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,785
Wonderful. Tomorrow night, then.

550
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:41,789
- Oh... 
- Well...

551
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:42,798
What?

552
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:45,081
It’s just that tomorrow night we were planning

553
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,849
to go to this winter carnival at the high school...

554
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:49,402
- But we can skip it. 
- Absolutely not.

555
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:51,609
Rory, you’re a young person who works hard.

556
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,050
It’s equally important to have fun. You go to the carnival.

557
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:55,983
Thank you.

558
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:57,817
Lorelai, you’ve had enough fun in your life.

559
00:22:57,907 --> 00:22:58,927
And then some.

560
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,643
Dinner will be for the grown-ups.

561
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:03,791
Now, how is the birthday going?

562
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,926
Wonderfully. They’re spoiling me rotten.

563
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,087
Emily got me the most beautiful humidor.

564
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:11,451
It’s from 1917, and was owned by a lieutenant in World War I.

565
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:14,410
You know, your father had a humidor that was owned by Victor Hugo.

566
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:15,354
Really?

567
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:16,725
I still have it if you’d like it.

568
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:17,703
Well, I’d love it.

569
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:20,771
Fine. I’ll take care of it as soon as I get back to London.

570
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:24,574
Now, if you will excuse me, I should like to freshen up.

571
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:25,937
I’ll make sure the guest room’s ready.

572
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,099
Oh, I can do that, Emily.

573
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:28,691
Thank you, Richard.

574
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,280
Emily, I expect to return in twenty minutes.

575
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:35,670
That should give you enough time to pull my gifts out of storage

576
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:39,700
and place them around the room as if they actually stand there all year.

577
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:43,796
You want some help with those gifts?

578
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:44,927
Yes, please.

579
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:53,616
Twelve courses, each paired with a specific wine,

580
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:57,624
and for dessert, individual chocolate amaretto mousse cakes in the shape of a G.

581
00:23:57,721 --> 00:23:59,185
Sookie, look what you’ve done.

582
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,070
- Over the top? 
- On a monumental scale.

583
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,658
Exactly what I was going for.

584
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:06,375
I’m also going to have individual little menus printed up and placed at each setting.

585
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:07,731
I love you for doing this.

586
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,011
Your mother is on the phone.

587
00:24:09,134 --> 00:24:10,527
Oh, can you take a message?

588
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,181
You mean, do I have the physical and mental capabilities

589
00:24:12,232 --> 00:24:14,633
to take a message? Why, yes, I do, however...

590
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:15,561
I got it.

591
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:20,128
- Hey Mom. 
- She wants to see your house.

592
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:22,754
- What? 
- Tonight, before the dinner.

593
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:24,281
- Oh, okay. 
- Okay?

594
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:26,800
Did you hear what I said? That horrifying woman wants to see your house.

595
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:28,561
Your house – the one with the monkey lamp.

596
00:24:28,637 --> 00:24:30,333
- Mom, relax. 
- Is it clean?

597
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,521
Yeah, it’s clean.

598
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:33,657
If I came in there wearing white gloves, what would I find?

599
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:35,577
That you could pull a rabbit out of your hat?

600
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:36,795
I don’t know what to do.

601
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:38,864
Oh, nevermind, I’ll just figure it out when I get there.

602
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:40,589
- When you get where? 
- I’ll call you later, Lorelai.

603
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:41,875
When you get where, Mom?

604
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,045
- I’m turning onto your street now. 
- Mom, no!

605
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,406
I’ll just let myself in. I know you keep a key in the turtle

606
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:47,578
or some ridiculous thing like that.

607
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:50,118
Mom, I beg of you, make a very dangerous u-turn right now

608
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:51,392
and go back where you came from.

609
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:53,016
I’m here. I’ll talk to you later, Lorelai.

610
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,568
Mom... mom!

611
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:02,950
Oh, Rory, super.

612
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:04,925
Could you step in here for a sec?

613
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:07,091
Oh, okay.

614
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:09,467
Thanks. I’m just so lucky I caught you.

615
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,221
What is this?

616
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:16,529
The supplementary student council meeting, silly.

617
00:25:16,606 --> 00:25:17,819
But Paris canceled that.

618
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:20,301
She did, didn’t she?

619
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,594
- What’s going on? 
- You tell us.

620
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:24,379
I don’t know.

621
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,432
Francie said there was an issue that has to be discussed.

622
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:27,496
We figured you ok’ed it.

623
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,541
I did not okay it.

624
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,768
Mr. Hunter, there’s been a mistake.

625
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,120
Paris canceled this meeting and...

626
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,933
I know, Rory, but Francie approached me

627
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,273
and said there was an issue that she had planned to discuss at the meeting today,

628
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:38,003
and it has a bit of a ticking clock on it.

629
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:39,950
You did not mention that you had anything.

630
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:42,115
I was just so surprised that Paris was canceling the meeting

631
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:43,662
that it flew right out of my head.

632
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,530
It was New York to London in three hours or less.

633
00:25:45,623 --> 00:25:46,330
I’ll bet.

634
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:47,835
Rory, if you take a seat, we can get started.

635
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:51,158
I move that we postpone this meeting until Paris can be reached.

636
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,431
We’re all here now, let’s just hear what Francie has to say.

637
00:25:53,544 --> 00:25:54,608
You can fill Paris in later.

638
00:25:54,813 --> 00:25:56,493
By the way, did anyone try to find her?

639
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:57,871
I saw her walking off with...

640
00:25:58,281 --> 00:25:59,472
who was that, her brother?

641
00:25:59,678 --> 00:26:00,825
Paris doesn’t have a brother.

642
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:03,195
Really? Well, she certainly seemed to know him.

643
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:05,372
Francie, why don’t you just tell us all why we’re here?

644
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:06,749
And how long we’re staying.

645
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:09,018
The Wadsworth Mansion has just had a cancellation,

646
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:10,926
which means that we can get it for prom,

647
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,688
if we move quickly. Shall we vote?

648
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,217
Hold on – the Wadsworth Mansion is too expensive.

649
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:16,523
We’ve already discussed this.

650
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:18,009
There are plenty of funds there to cover it.

651
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:19,923
Not if we want a telescope to be the senior gift.

652
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,554
You mean, not if Paris wants a telescope to be the senior gift.

653
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:23,851
We all thought it was a good idea.

654
00:26:23,943 --> 00:26:25,085
Reach for the stars?

655
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:26,462
Nice theme, original.

656
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:28,638
- Was ‘Be all that you can be’ taken? 
- It’s a good gift.

657
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,828
It’s a fine gift. However, so is planting a nice tree in the quad.

658
00:26:31,926 --> 00:26:33,113
Every class plants a tree.

659
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:35,464
Then, who are we to judge those who came before?

660
00:26:35,588 --> 00:26:37,082
I say, let’s put it to a vote.

661
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,950
This isn’t right. Paris should be here.

662
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:40,819
I agree, Paris should be here.

663
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:43,447
However, she’s not, so once again, shall we vote?

664
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:44,716
Rory, as student body vice president,

665
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:46,099
I need you to call for a vote.

666
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:50,533
All those in favor of using the funds for the Wadsworth Mansion,

667
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:54,685
even though we will be cheating the next generation of Chilton students

668
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:56,984
who would love a nice telescope, say aye.

669
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:00,477
Wadsworth Mansion it is.

670
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:01,474
Meeting dismissed.

671
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:06,416
Chin up, we’ll make it a really big tree.

672
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,796
Hold it right there!

673
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:28,163
Step back and move away from the couch.

674
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:29,960
- This couch cannot stay. 
- Yes, it can.

675
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,567
- It’s awful. 
- It can hear you.

676
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,642
- Please. 
- No.

677
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:34,399
What about the chair? Let me move the chair.

678
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:35,628
No, the chair stays also.

679
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:36,856
We have to do something.

680
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:38,844
I brought flowers over and can’t find a decent vase.

681
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:41,679
All I could find was a ceramic Betty Boop head.

682
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:43,134
Mom, you’re making yourself crazy.

683
00:27:43,302 --> 00:27:46,052
I know. We’ll get some tarps and throw them over everything

684
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:48,143
- and tell her that you’re painting. 
- Mom, stop it.

685
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,091
- What is so horrible about this room? 
- Look at it.

686
00:27:50,198 --> 00:27:51,972
I am. I like it.

687
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:53,924
You may like it, but your grandmother will not.

688
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,754
She’s going to take one look around here at the junk store collection

689
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:58,813
of hobo furniture and she’s going to blame me.

690
00:27:58,951 --> 00:27:59,786
For what?

691
00:27:59,955 --> 00:28:01,224
For letting you live like this.

692
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:04,143
For not teaching you better. For not redecorating while you’re out of town.

693
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,602
We’re never out of town.

694
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:07,977
For not sending you out of town so I could redecorate!

695
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:09,715
Mom, you don’t believe that.

696
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:12,618
Everything that’s wrong in your life is my fault.

697
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:15,096
Everything that’s wrong in your father’s life is my fault.

698
00:28:15,183 --> 00:28:17,215
Basically, everything’s that wrong is my fault.

699
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:18,951
Mom, would you sit down for a minute.

700
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:23,586
And it’s lumpy, perfect.

701
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,780
Mom, if I may, I’d like to give you some advice.

702
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:27,718
You would?

703
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,862
You need to develop a defense mechanism for dealing with Grandma.

704
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,881
What are you talking about?

705
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,580
You just need a system, a new mindset.

706
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,322
- Take me, for example. 
- What about you?

707
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:38,086
I know there are many things in my life you don’t approve of.

708
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:40,217
- Like what? 
- Like this couch.

709
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:41,841
Well, this couch is terrible.

710
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,954
Okay, good – you think the couch is terrible.

711
00:28:44,247 --> 00:28:48,292
Now, at one point in my life, you saying a couch that I carefully picked out

712
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,463
and had to pay off over eight months is terrible

713
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,864
might’ve hurt my feelings, but not anymore.

714
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:53,971
- No? 
- No.

715
00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:54,728
Why not?

716
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,800
Because one day, I decided that instead of being hurt

717
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:59,423
and upset by your disapproval, I’m gonna be amused.

718
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:00,616
I’m gonna find it funny.

719
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,423
I’m even going to take a little bit of pleasure in it.

720
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:05,010
You take pleasure in my disapproval?

721
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:07,556
I encourage it sometimes just for a laugh.

722
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:08,840
I don’t know what to think of that.

723
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:12,260
Think, ‘hey, that’s brilliant’, because this idea could set you free.

724
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:16,448
Mom, what are you thinking about?

725
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:18,333
That ridiculous Betty Boop head.

726
00:29:19,397 --> 00:29:20,887
So am I.

727
00:29:29,014 --> 00:29:31,614
Francie, so good of you to stop by.

728
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:33,535
I know how busy you are. Gum?

729
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:34,963
What’s your damage, Gilmore?

730
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,431
Damage? No damage. I just thought we should chat.

731
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:38,885
Yeah? Well, I don’t have any...

732
00:29:38,957 --> 00:29:40,155
Oh, you know what, I changed my mind.

733
00:29:40,252 --> 00:29:41,978
I don’t think we should chat, I think I should chat.

734
00:29:42,137 --> 00:29:45,096
Ready? Okay. That little stunt you pulled – not good.

735
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:45,865
Stunt?

736
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:47,621
- Paris canceled that meeting. 
- Something came up.

737
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:48,947
Then you should have brought it to Paris.

738
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:50,176
Paris wasn’t around.

739
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:51,932
She was off yet again with the mystery man.

740
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:54,861
- Jealous? 
- Of Paris’ lobotomy victim? I think not.

741
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:57,359
What is wrong with you? So what if Paris has a boyfriend?

742
00:29:57,451 --> 00:30:00,447
You don’t think that as hard as Paris works in school or on the Franklin

743
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:01,684
or on student council - you don’t think

744
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:03,478
that she deserves to have a boyfriend and to enjoy it?

745
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:06,781
Hey, no one is denying Gidget a chance to snag Moondoggie

746
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:09,401
for the clambake, but the rest of us have things to accomplish.

747
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,461
You’ve had one goal since the beginning of the year.

748
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:12,837
To achieve the perfect liquid line.

749
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:13,898
To take Paris down.

750
00:30:14,006 --> 00:30:15,434
And to achieve the perfect liquid line.

751
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,912
I tried to intervene, I tried to smooth the path between both sides,

752
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,331
but you know what? That’s over.

753
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:21,517
- Oh, it is? 
- Yes, it is.

754
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:23,579
I’m finished being your go-between.

755
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:27,119
You’re a jerk, and if you wanna play it this way, then fine.

756
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,306
All bets are off. I’m no longer your ally.

757
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:31,384
You wanna play rough – fine.

758
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:33,933
I’ve read The Art of War. I can be just as big a pain

759
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:35,808
in your butt as you are in Paris’, capiche?

760
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,866
You do not wanna be my enemy, Marlo Thomas.

761
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,505
I think I do, Tina Louise.

762
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:40,683
- Fine. 
- It is fine.

763
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:42,320
- Can I go now? 
- The door’s right there.

764
00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:43,642
You’re gonna be very sorry.

765
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:44,952
Am I?

766
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:47,293
Oh yes... you are.

767
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:48,909
I’m good with that.

768
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,234
I’m running out of space.

769
00:30:57,362 --> 00:30:59,118
- How many bouquets you got left? 
- Three.

770
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:00,992
- Can you put ‘em on your dresser? 
- Dresser’s full.

771
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:02,451
Can you squish ‘em in with another bunch?

772
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:03,338
Already squished.

773
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:05,861
Can you toss ‘em out the window like I did my last five bouquets?

774
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,891
- Done. 
- Great.

775
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:09,201
Okay, so monkey lamp’s in the closet,

776
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:10,572
singing rabbi’s in a drawer,

777
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:13,659
and all Spice Girl memorabilia’s under your bed. How do I look?

778
00:31:13,763 --> 00:31:16,088
Like a woman who does not own any Spice Girl memorabilia.

779
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:17,239
- You look pretty, too. 
- Thank you.

780
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:19,513
And I want a play-by-play of the carnival tonight.

781
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,300
- I promise. 
- And you can leave out all the...

782
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:22,477
Hand kissing sounds, gladly.

783
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:25,027
Oop, they’re here.

784
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:27,290
Hey, if she doesn’t like the house – what happens then?

785
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,473
I think we have to move.

786
00:31:29,736 --> 00:31:30,650
Smile pretty.

787
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:35,754
Hi Mom, hi Dad, hi Gran.

788
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:36,736
Was your trip good?

789
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,713
The trip was fine. Hello Rory.

790
00:31:38,812 --> 00:31:40,348
Hi Gran. Hi Grandma, hi Grandpa.

791
00:31:40,547 --> 00:31:43,706
Now that we’ve exhausted the greetings, kindly move aside.

792
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,877
- I’d like to see your house. 
- Oh, come on in.

793
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:49,518
- If I pass out... 
- I’ll yell timber.

794
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,039
So, Gran, what do you think? I mean, it’s not much.

795
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,937
Probably too modest for Korn, but Weezer’d be pretty comfortable.

796
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:36,773
Let’s go.

797
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:39,743
Are we moving?

798
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:40,973
I don’t know.

799
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:43,915
Lorelai, I swear to God, if you prolong this evening...

800
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:45,200
- Coming. 
- Have fun.

801
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:47,711
No one appreciates your sarcasm, young lady.

802
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:56,175
- Boy, it’s pretty out tonight, isn’t it? 
- Sure is.

803
00:32:56,272 --> 00:32:57,280
Like a snow globe.

804
00:32:58,194 --> 00:32:59,348
Sparkly.

805
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:02,636
I mean, I don’t think a night comes any prettier than this one.

806
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:04,997
And if you take a really pretty night and add a corndog...

807
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:07,141
- I’m not going to that carnival with you. 
- Why not?

808
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:09,718
I will be in front of Miss Patty’s at nine as promised.

809
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,115
You are stubborn and impossible.

810
00:33:11,316 --> 00:33:12,252
See you at nine.

811
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:13,302
Rory!

812
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,838
Clara, hi!

813
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,233
I haven’t seen you in forever.

814
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:20,404
- Longer than forever. 
- She got away from me.

815
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:21,567
Buy a stronger leash.

816
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:25,391
Hey, did you see they got the crazy psychic from Woodbury again?

817
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:27,065
You’re kidding. I thought she got arrested.

818
00:33:27,189 --> 00:33:28,948
She’s out now and sitting right over there.

819
00:33:29,078 --> 00:33:31,321
I love her. She always tells me I’m gonna be rich and famous.

820
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:33,496
She tells everybody that they’re gonna be rich and famous.

821
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,217
- Who are you? 
- No one.

822
00:33:35,411 --> 00:33:37,264
- Yes, you are. 
- No, I’m not.

823
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:39,159
That’s Jess. Jess, this is Clara.

824
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,394
Are you guys going to the carnival?

825
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:41,694
I’m going, Jess isn’t.

826
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,594
- Why not? 
- He has things to do.

827
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:45,919
Then you can go with me and Dean, right?

828
00:33:46,015 --> 00:33:47,317
- Oh, well... 
- I’m going.

829
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:48,490
What?

830
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:49,876
To the carnival. I’m going to the carnival.

831
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,272
- I thought you had things to do. 
- Well, I don’t.

832
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,183
Rory just said you had things to do.

833
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:55,999
Hey Tatu, just look at the plane, will ya?

834
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:56,733
What?

835
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,118
Jess, you don’t have to go. We can meet later like you said.

836
00:33:59,226 --> 00:34:00,281
What? No.

837
00:34:00,527 --> 00:34:02,647
Come on, how many chances does a guy have to go

838
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:04,439
to a Stars Hollow High winter carnival, right?

839
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:06,558
- Right. 
- Okay, then. Let’s go.

840
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,343
- To the carnival! 
- To the carnival.

841
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:11,454
I want a pretzel and a snowcone and a cheese stick...

842
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,396
Pace yourself.

843
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:14,355
Rory never tells me to pace myself.

844
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:17,884
And this is our dining room.

845
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:19,963
- Small. 
- Or quaint.

846
00:34:20,203 --> 00:34:21,315
Touche.

847
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:23,470
Oh, you’re in for a real treat, Trix.

848
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,565
This Sookie is one of the best chefs around.

849
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:27,275
Here’s our table, Gran. Why don’t you sit here?

850
00:34:27,388 --> 00:34:28,064
All right.

851
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,914
Well, Lorelai, I must say, on first viewing,

852
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:34,797
this little inn of yours looks quite impressive.

853
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:35,637
Thank you.

854
00:34:35,852 --> 00:34:38,986
I mean, it’s certainly no arboretum, but it’s nice just the same.

855
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:40,716
It was just a suggestion, Mom.

856
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:41,924
Yes, it was.

857
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:43,993
Oh, look, a menu.

858
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,540
That’s a nice little touch.

859
00:34:45,611 --> 00:34:47,536
Sookie wanted everything perfect for tonight.

860
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:49,446
Hey, there you are.

861
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:50,762
Oh, Michel, great.

862
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:53,655
Gran, I’d like you to meet Michel Gerard, our concierge.

863
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:55,294
Michel, this is my grandmother, Lorelai.

864
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:57,290
Very pleased to meet you.

865
00:34:57,418 --> 00:34:58,339
Do you have a pen?

866
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:00,121
Why, of course.

867
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:02,754
Now, please take this to your chef.

868
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:06,072
These are the times I would like each course to appear at this table.

869
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:11,125
I like a brisk pace, twelve minutes per course is best for my digestion.

870
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:16,625
However, please tell your servers that they are not to clear until everyone has finished.

871
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:17,818
Thank you.

872
00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:19,928
Oh, no, thank you.

873
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:22,836
It is so rare that I get to carry a note anymore.

874
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,673
- Is Jess your real name? 
- Yes.

875
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:30,394
- Do you like it? 
- It’s fine.

876
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,693
- Would you rather be named Bill? 
- No.

877
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:34,127
- Frank? 
- No.

878
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:35,036
- Mike? 
- No.

879
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,092
- Bob? 
- No.

880
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:37,746
- Ed? 
- Does this belong to you?

881
00:35:37,997 --> 00:35:39,969
Clara, you want a snowcone?

882
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:42,057
Yes. Will you go get me a snowcone?

883
00:35:42,202 --> 00:35:44,003
Absolutely. Go stand in the middle of the street

884
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,458
and wait for me, I’ll be right back.

885
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:48,090
- I’ll get your snowcone. 
- And one for Rory, too.

886
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,686
- And one for Rory, too. 
- Thanks.

887
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:51,592
Do you wash your hair?

888
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:53,702
Yes, I wash my hair.

889
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,585
Then why does it stick up like that?

890
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:56,395
Because.

891
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,397
It looks crazy.

892
00:35:58,705 --> 00:35:59,569
Rory!

893
00:36:01,649 --> 00:36:03,957
Hey, how’s the fundraiser going?

894
00:36:04,618 --> 00:36:06,738
- The turnout looks good. 
- The turnout’s great.

895
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:08,878
Apparently, people are starved for entertainment around here.

896
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,737
Hurrah for bad cable reception.

897
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:13,410
So, I’m sorry, but did I just see you with Jess and Dean,

898
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,939
- or do I need a new prescription? 
- Your prescription’s fine.

899
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,982
- So explain. 
- Tomorrow at Luke’s.

900
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,781
I need to get back before there’s a more exciting ending to the evening.

901
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:23,548
- Forget nothing. 
- I promise.

902
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:25,601
You missed.

903
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:27,551
You missed.

904
00:36:29,843 --> 00:36:30,593
You missed.

905
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:31,935
Hey, you wanna learn how to fly?

906
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:33,020
How’s everybody doing?

907
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:35,124
- Jess can’t throw. 
- I can, too.

908
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,671
You missed every time.

909
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,641
I can’t concentrate with your annoying midget voice yammering on and on.

910
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:42,023
It’s like having Stuart Little shoved in my ear.

911
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:44,070
Here. They only had cherry.

912
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:45,504
Oh, that’s all we need.

913
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:47,331
So, you play any of the games yet?

914
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:49,206
Nope, I’ve been watching him lose.

915
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,699
You don’t get a bear, but it’s still pretty fun.

916
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,697
How about I go beat you at ice bowling?

917
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,745
- You can’t beat me. 
- Oh, I think I can.

918
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:57,126
Let’s go!

919
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:58,518
- We’ll be back. 
- Okay.

920
00:36:59,313 --> 00:37:01,571
- So, how much to play? 
- A dollar.

921
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:02,950
- Okay. 
- I got it.

922
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:06,748
Just for the record, I’m a girl and we are supposed to throw like this.

923
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:11,106
So you got anything you wanna tell me?

924
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:12,535
I like your crazy hair.

925
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:14,290
You weren’t just gonna go to the carnival with Dean?

926
00:37:14,438 --> 00:37:17,398
No. Running into them was a total coincidence.

927
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:19,098
- I swear. 
- Okay.

928
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,273
Not even close.

929
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:24,525
So when did you and Dean get so buddy-buddy again?

930
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:25,667
We’re not so buddy-buddy.

931
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:27,439
Last time I checked, you weren’t even speaking.

932
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:28,642
Now he’s fetching you snowcones?

933
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:30,732
- He was getting one for Clara. 
- You guys talking?

934
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,134
No, we’re not talking.

935
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:35,412
We talked, once.

936
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:36,881
You got my interest.

937
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:40,266
We ran into each other and he wanted to get coffee,

938
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:42,410
- so I did, and we talked. 
- About?

939
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,876
Just boring things.

940
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:47,848
Clara’s horseback riding, his college application, nothing earth shattering.

941
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:52,407
And he asked if we could be friends, and I said sure.

942
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:53,491
Friends?

943
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,437
Jess, he knows we’re together, okay?

944
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:56,906
And it’s a small town.

945
00:37:57,045 --> 00:38:00,307
Dean and I will see it each other, and I just thought it wouldn’t hurt to be polite.

946
00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:01,531
So you’re just being polite?

947
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:04,142
Yes. Dean has never done anything bad to me,

948
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:05,975
- and I just, I want to... 
- I got it.

949
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:07,526
You’re mad.

950
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,425
Nope, just figured you could’ve told me.

951
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:11,386
- I’m sorry. 
- No biggie.

952
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:12,723
You gonna throw that?

953
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:14,940
- You’re really not mad? 
- Nope, not mad at all.

954
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:16,123
- And you understand? 
- I understand.

955
00:38:16,558 --> 00:38:17,976
And you believe me?

956
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:20,019
Like you’re standing with an ax next to a cherry tree.

957
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:21,934
- And you’re okay with it? 
- Will you just throw the ball?

958
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,041
Oh my God, I did it!

959
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:26,937
Very impressive.

960
00:38:27,065 --> 00:38:28,258
Here you go, congratulations.

961
00:38:28,365 --> 00:38:29,252
Thanks.

962
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:31,454
Hello sad, pathetic bear.

963
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:32,959
You know, I could’ve bought you that thing for a quarter.

964
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:34,275
No, it’s better that I won it.

965
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:37,081
- Maybe Clara would like it. 
- Yes, shoved in her mouth.

966
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:39,293
- She’s cute. 
- Oh, just darling.

967
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:44,715
And so far, knock wood,

968
00:38:45,038 --> 00:38:46,296
things seem to be picking up.

969
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,503
It’s about time you went into business.

970
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:51,418
Emily, you should’ve encouraged him to do this years ago.

971
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:52,513
Yes, I should’ve.

972
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:53,824
He’s a go-getter, your father.

973
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:55,668
Not completely dissimilar to yourself.

974
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,502
Thank you, Gran.

975
00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:57,403
Hello.

976
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,996
Just wanted to check and see how your dinner was coming along.

977
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,376
Sookie, it’s amazing. Gran, this is our chef, Sookie.

978
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,953
The food is excellent.

979
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:05,222
Thank you very much.

980
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:10,045
Young lady, your uniform has a large cut down the middle of your back.

981
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:13,856
It does? Oh yeah, I did get myself.

982
00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:15,540
Sookie, how on earth did you do that?

983
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:18,868
Oh, well, I... and the chop flew, so I lunged...

984
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:21,340
and then the floor slipped... and then...

985
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:22,443
ooh! You know, and I just...

986
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,968
did a flip, ya know.

987
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:26,554
I guess you just kind of had to be there.

988
00:39:26,722 --> 00:39:27,880
Yes, apparently so.

989
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:30,784
Okay, well, nice to meet you.

990
00:39:30,947 --> 00:39:33,788
I have to get back. We have quite a tight schedule to follow.

991
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,854
Yes, we do.

992
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:39,580
So, Trix, let’s talk about the Hartford house.

993
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:41,157
Do you have a new tenant lined up yet?

994
00:39:41,397 --> 00:39:42,242
Yes, I do.

995
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:43,445
- Who? 
- Me.

996
00:39:43,696 --> 00:39:44,823
What?

997
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:46,415
I wasn’t going to bring this up tonight,

998
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:47,753
but since you asked,

999
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:50,006
my health hasn’t been too good lately.

1000
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:51,034
What, what’s the matter?

1001
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:52,857
What the matter is, I’m not twenty.

1002
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,822
Anyhow, the weather in London is quite damp,

1003
00:39:55,928 --> 00:39:59,923
and I have a yearning to be a little closer to my immediate family,

1004
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,352
so now that Korn has moved out of my house,

1005
00:40:03,446 --> 00:40:05,110
I thought perhaps I would move back in.

1006
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,322
When, Gran?

1007
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:10,399
As soon as I can close up the London house and get my affairs in order.

1008
00:40:10,502 --> 00:40:12,207
I think that’s a wonderful idea.

1009
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:14,772
I’m thrilled. In fact, I’m so thrilled,

1010
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:16,292
I’m not going to be angry with you

1011
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:18,336
for not telling me you were in ill health.

1012
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,527
I will be fine, Richard.

1013
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,693
You will be fine, because as soon as you’re back here,

1014
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:24,158
I’m going to send you to the finest doctors.

1015
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:25,248
Whatever you say.

1016
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:27,383
And Emily and I are going to look after you completely,

1017
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,487
day and night. You can count on us.

1018
00:40:29,616 --> 00:40:30,619
I knew I could.

1019
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:32,407
Oh, it’s time for the next course.

1020
00:40:32,632 --> 00:40:34,393
Waiter, our next course please.

1021
00:40:34,706 --> 00:40:36,302
I’m not done.

1022
00:40:36,446 --> 00:40:37,614
What do you mean, you’re not done?

1023
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,163
- You had twelve minutes. 
- I’m not done.

1024
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:43,271
Fine, we will wait.

1025
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:58,556
That’ll do, pig. That’ll do.

1026
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:08,184
Need some help with the big words?

1027
00:41:08,628 --> 00:41:09,329
Sure.

1028
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,767
Why don’t you come over here

1029
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,503
and I’ll show you which one’s giving me a hard time.

1030
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:15,090
You’re getting a little pathetic man.

1031
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:16,068
Thanks for the heads up.

1032
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:17,824
- Let’s be friends? 
- No thanks.

1033
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:19,299
You don’t think I know what you’re doing?

1034
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:21,311
You don’t think it’s so pathetically transparent?

1035
00:41:21,423 --> 00:41:22,313
Get out of here, Jess.

1036
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:23,809
Rory’s taking pity on you.

1037
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:26,523
That’s why the sudden interest in being your friend. You know that?

1038
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,377
Whatever you say.

1039
00:41:27,474 --> 00:41:29,072
The saddest part of this whole thing is...

1040
00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:30,997
Man, you like hearing yourself talk.

1041
00:41:31,094 --> 00:41:33,972
You really think that by being her friend, you’re gonna get her back.

1042
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:35,176
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

1043
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:36,048
No, huh?

1044
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:37,286
Rory and I are just friends,

1045
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:39,196
just like you and Rory were just friends.

1046
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:40,465
And hey,

1047
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,214
look how it turned out for you.

1048
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:45,581
Okay, I’m ready for popcorn.

1049
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:47,982
You got it.

1050
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:49,452
Bye Jess.

1051
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:51,863
You think Rory wants some popcorn?

1052
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:54,147
I don’t know. Let’s go ask her.

1053
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,352
This is very impressive.

1054
00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:03,102
Not as impressive as my mother

1055
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:04,853
making four green beans last an hour and a half.

1056
00:42:04,915 --> 00:42:05,801
I wish I’d seen that.

1057
00:42:05,907 --> 00:42:09,170
When she finally got to the last bean, she cut it in six pieces.

1058
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,992
I swear, I thought Gran was gonna lunge across the table at her.

1059
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:13,834
The student surpasses the master.

1060
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:15,058
I was a little proud.

1061
00:42:15,238 --> 00:42:17,220
Although I’m bummed I missed the carnival.

1062
00:42:17,393 --> 00:42:18,944
There’s a snowcone in the freezer for you.

1063
00:42:19,308 --> 00:42:21,377
How’d it finally end with Cheech and Chong?

1064
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:24,249
Jess knows I’m friends with Dean,

1065
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:26,764
Dean knows I’m dating Jess, and they both seem fine with it.

1066
00:42:27,985 --> 00:42:29,230
What?

1067
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:33,640
I just like that once in awhile, you still seem like a little kid.

1068
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,002
They do, I swear.

1069
00:42:36,508 --> 00:42:38,704
Let’s just watch the snow.
