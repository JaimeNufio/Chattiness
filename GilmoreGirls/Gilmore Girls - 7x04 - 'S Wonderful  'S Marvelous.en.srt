1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:01,805
Previously on
"Gilmore Girls"...

2
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:03,665
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing ?

3
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:05,185
I had a really great
time last night.

4
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:08,526
Let's not make more
out of it than it was.

5
00:00:08,536 --> 00:00:09,597
You slept with dad?

6
00:00:09,607 --> 00:00:11,345
Yeah, I did.

7
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:13,893
Is that why you and Luke broke up,
because you slept with dad?

8
00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:15,595
You don't belong with me.

9
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:17,646
You belong with someone
like Christopher.

10
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:19,321
You can go back to
being Lorelai Gilmore,

11
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,863
and I'll go back to being the guy
in the diner who pours your coffee.

12
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:22,701
I love you.

13
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:25,287
I know the other night didn't
mean for you what it did for me.

14
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:27,321
But I don't regret it and haven't
stopped thinking about it.

15
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:30,013
And if I have to wait until we're
both 80 years old for you to see it,

16
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:32,063
then I'll wait.

17
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:34,573
I can't wait to come see you, Logan.
I can't wait.

18
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:36,371
- I already got you a ticket.
- You're kidding.

19
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:39,212
I got it right here. I was gonna fedex
it to you. You'll have it by tomorrow.

20
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,163
Tell your mom you're not
gonna be home for Christmas.

21
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:42,583
Christmas?

22
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:44,543
Hi, Chris.

23
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:48,581
Let me bottom-line it for you.

24
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:50,932
Snakes are gross.
Snakes are scary and slithery,

25
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:52,953
and do you know where
snakes do not belong?

26
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:54,643
- On a plane?
- They do not belong on a plane.

27
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:55,953
It's not an ideal situation.

28
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:58,233
They do not belong
anywhere except in cages

29
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:00,422
stuck in safes buried deep,
deep underground.

30
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,030
- I hate snakes!
- So I'm gathering.

31
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:05,013
With their gross, no-legged bodies,
and their scaly, scaly skin,

32
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:07,023
and their wiggling,
and their hissing.

33
00:01:07,038 --> 00:01:09,951
Okay, Lor. I respect your very
valid feelings about snakes.

34
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:10,590
Thank you.

35
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:12,891
But I have to say we
were fairly warned.

36
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:14,120
No! No!

37
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:16,172
A movie should not
just be its title.

38
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:18,473
"Driving miss daisy" didn't
all take place in the car,

39
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:21,063
"Dances with wolves" wasn't
one long wolf dance.

40
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:23,271
But this was nothing
but snakes, snakes,

41
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:25,283
relentless snakes,
snakes on a plane.

42
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:27,020
Snakes, snakes,
snakes on a plane!

43
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:28,951
This was our fifth
bad movie in a row.

44
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,193
It's got to be some
kind of a record.

45
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:32,662
We got to face facts--
movies have gotten bad.

46
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,793
Unless it's our fault.

47
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:35,583
What? No,
we didn't make the bad movies.

48
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,441
No, we made the movies bad.
Think about it.

49
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:39,110
We are the common factor.

50
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:39,931
Ohh.

51
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:41,430
All the movies --
very different.

52
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:43,542
Different genres --
different languages, even.

53
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:46,083
We saw them in different
theaters at different times.

54
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:47,241
What do they all
have in common?

55
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:48,702
They were all seen by us.

56
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:50,180
- Wow!
- Huh?

57
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:51,953
We can never see
"Casablanca" together.

58
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,861
I mean, I'm very sorry.
I don't care how much I love it,

59
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:57,412
but I will not be responsible
for ruining "Casablanca."

60
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:02,133
So...

61
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:07,833
So... we should
divvy up the candy.

62
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,480
- Divvy...
- The candy.

63
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:10,701
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

64
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:15,132
Got half the Milk Duds.

65
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:18,103
Sour Patch Kids --
hmm, a third.

66
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:22,101
Twizzlers -- you got about 5 --
4 3/4 -- you pick.

67
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:23,363
Yeah, I'll take the Twizzlers.

68
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,261
No, I meant besides
the Twizzlers.

69
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:27,610
I tell you what --
you can have it all.

70
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:29,872
Such a gentleman.

71
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:51,043
We should...

72
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:53,243
- Yeah, I should, uh...
- I should...

73
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:55,231
Okay.

74
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:56,883
Yeah.

75
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:59,031
Okay.

76
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:02,493
- Good night, Lor.
- Good night, Chris.

77
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:16,921
H i.

78
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:20,051
Well, well, someone is cutting
it pretty close to curfew.

79
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,030
Did you guys have a good time?

80
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,062
Yeah, really good.

81
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,510
Ooh, is it weird that
he didn't come in?

82
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:24,612
- Weird for me?
- Yeah.

83
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:27,183
Oh, I saw the guy two days ago.
I'm sick of him.

84
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:28,780
- Is it weird for you?
- No. No.

85
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:31,313
Okay. He could come in
if you wanted him to.

86
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,571
I mean,
I could make myself scarce.

87
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:34,750
Oh, no, you wouldn't have
to make yourself scarce.

88
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:38,040
Oh, then I could be un-scarce. I could
be here in all my plentiful glory.

89
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:38,933
That's more normal.

90
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:41,363
God, I forget what the protocol is
when your mom is dating your dad.

91
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:43,702
Yeah, me too.
We'll have to consult Emily Post again.

92
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:44,771
Yeah.

93
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:47,043
But I really don't
think it would be weird.

94
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,953
- It wouldn't?
- No. I mean, if it was,

95
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:51,801
it wouldn't be weird in a bad way.
I mean, if that's what you want.

96
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:52,640
Okay.

97
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:53,902
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know.

98
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:56,350
No. Not now. Maybe...

99
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:58,740
I want it.
I don't know. Twizzler?

100
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:00,382
- Okay.
- Okay.

101
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,060
It's good, though. You know?

102
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:08,620
He and I, between us --
it's -- it's going good.

103
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:09,900
Well, good.

104
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:12,450
Yeah, when I had lunch with him the other 
day, he said things were really good.

105
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,481
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:14,722
What'd he say?

107
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,133
Um, nice things.

108
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:17,290
Oh, yeah?

109
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:19,150
- Yep.
- Like what?

110
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,740
Nice things.

111
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:23,273
Did he talk about my sparkling
eyes and my glossy, raven hair?

112
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:25,201
Look, I'm not gonna pass
notes between you guys.

113
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:27,513
What if Emily Post says that's
part of the appropriate protocol?

114
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:29,870
If you can get it in writing
from the ghost of Emily Post,

115
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:32,800
then I will pass as
many notes as you want.

116
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:35,851
- But, mom...
- Yeah?

117
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:38,361
I'm really glad things
are good between you.

118
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,563
- Me too.
- I'm just...

119
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:42,051
Yeah?

120
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,983
I just want you to be careful.

121
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,340
Is this the safe-sex talk?

122
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:47,480
Because even if the ghost of
Emily Post says it's okay,

123
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:48,761
it is just plain weird.

124
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:51,742
No. Mom, I want you to be
careful with you, with him.

125
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:55,091
I just...
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

126
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:57,431
I am. I am being careful.

127
00:04:57,448 --> 00:04:59,970
Okay. Good.

128
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,671
Oh, my gosh.
Am I coming with you to college?

129
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:04,493
Excuse me?

130
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,891
You totally want me to come
to Yale with you, don't you?

131
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:07,911
What? No.

132
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,960
Then why are you packing all of
my clothes -- my pink t-shirt?!

133
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,163
-  Where'd that come from?
- Oh, my goodness.

134
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:16,851
That is so nice of you to
think of me in school --

135
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,691
My sweet skirt!

136
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:20,051
I hope you brought a toothbrush

137
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:23,123
'cause, boy, oh, boy,
are we gonna have fun!

138
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,753
My cozy sweater...

139
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:24,633
Okay, two eggs over-easy,
hash browns cooked well,

140
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:26,643
whole-wheat toast buttered, and

141
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:29,213
with a side of marmalade.

142
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:31,580
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

143
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,622
All right, what can I get you?

144
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:38,533
Kirk, you're scaring
away the customers.

145
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:42,141
I am not gonna ask you what's wrong.
Either eat or go.

146
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,857
Women troubles, Luke.
Haven't slept in days.

147
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:47,513
See the bags under my eyes?
See the glazed look?

148
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:48,220
Women.

149
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:50,342
See this glazed look?
Don't care.

150
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:53,460
Mom's been incredibly possessive lately,
as has Lulu,

151
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:54,893
and it's very tense.

152
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:56,772
I noticed they were beginning
to snipe at each other,

153
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,790
but I figured it was
a friendly competition

154
00:06:58,805 --> 00:07:00,602
I could work to my advantage,
you know?

155
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,720
When you've got two women
making you sherry cobbler,

156
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:04,573
you're likely to end up with
some pretty good cobbler.

157
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:05,802
Basic capitalism.

158
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:07,171
That's not how they see it.

159
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:10,820
Oh,  no. Apparently,
it's mom's cobbler or Lulu's cobbler.

160
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:12,990
- I've got to choose.
- Are you gonna order something?

161
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:14,891
I'd love to order something.
I'm starving.

162
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:16,190
But what should I get?

163
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:18,681
Lulu would want me to get something hip,
like a bagel.

164
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:19,363
Hip?

165
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,992
But mom would say a growing boy
needs something more substantial,

166
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:22,900
like pancakes.

167
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,202
Well, neither of them are here,
so what do you want?

168
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:29,230
I don't know!
Bagel, pancakes, bagel, pancakes...

169
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,672
It's like their voices
are blocking out my voice,

170
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:33,521
and I don't know what
I think anymore.

171
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:36,680
I'll have a bagel and pancakes,
I guess.

172
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:39,283
Yeah, what kind of bagel?

173
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,502
Lulu would kill me if I got the onion,
you know,

174
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:43,052
'cause of all the kissing --

175
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:45,383
and mom would freak
over the poppy seed

176
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:48,010
'cause she thinks poppies
are a gateway drug.

177
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:50,931
What about... egg?

178
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,921
Egg, it is.

179
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:54,861
- Hey.
- Hey.

180
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:56,323
I didn't expect you till later.

181
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,151
I know, but I wanted 
to go over April's schedule

182
00:07:58,188 --> 00:07:59,590
before I brought her by.

183
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:01,133
- Is this a good time?
- Sure, let's sit.

184
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:02,471
Great.

185
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:06,500
So, this is her schedule.

186
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:08,970
I think I erred on the
side of too many details.

187
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:10,392
I like details.

188
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,231
These are some of the phone
numbers you might need --

189
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:15,610
pediatrician, dentist, orthodontist --
if her retainer breaks --

190
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:17,700
- optometrist...
- If her glasses break.

191
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:20,481
So, my mom has her back
surgery on monday,

192
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:22,781
but, apparently,
the recovery process is really slow,

193
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:24,951
so I'm gonna be in New
Mexico at least two weeks.

194
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,502
It's fine. April can stay with
me as long as you need her to.

195
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:31,460
Thanks. I really
appreciate this.

196
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:34,840
- All right, so what's this packet?
- Right.

197
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:36,530
Registration forms,
some waivers --

198
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,823
April will need to have this when
she goes to school tomorrow.

199
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:41,431
And she will tell you she
needs to be there at 7:30,

200
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:43,931
but she really doesn't need
to be there until 8:00.

201
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:45,680
Anyway, it's all in the notes.

202
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:48,132
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

203
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:51,691
Okay, maybe a little.

204
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:52,890
It'll be fine?

205
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:55,743
It will be fine. I promise.

206
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:59,990
Wow! Today's secret
ingredient is gourds!

207
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,402
Aren't they beautiful?

208
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,450
I guess that depends
on the beholder's eye.

209
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:05,832
Jackson's whole squash
crop went crazy this year.

210
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,070
We had such a hot summer,

211
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:09,140
and these babies love the sun.

212
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:10,461
You've got to try this soup.

213
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:11,842
Wait, is that gourd soup?

214
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:14,191
It's so good.
It's sweet and rich.

215
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,892
It's like pie, only it's soup.

216
00:09:15,908 --> 00:09:17,140
It's like pie soup!

217
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,561
No, I don't eat orange food,

218
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:20,400
- except for candy corn.
- You eat cheetos.

219
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,801
I don't eat food that's
naturally orange.

220
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:22,673
You eat oranges.

221
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,153
I eat food that's naturally orange,
but I don't eat gourds.

222
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:26,231
Fine.

223
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:27,630
What else is going on at home?

224
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:31,201
Ooh! Martha is so close to walking.
She's right on the verge.

225
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:33,522
Why don't you come over
tomorrow night for dinner?

226
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,762
Maybe you'll see
the inaugural steps.

227
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,931
Um, I'd love to, but...

228
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:41,403
But you want to wait to see if 
Christopher calls and asks youout first,

229
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,240
and then if he doesn't,
you'll come over.

230
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:44,771
Something like that, yes.

231
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:47,021
You two have been seeing quite
a bit of each other lately.

232
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:48,422
Yeah, we're just dating.

233
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:51,911
Right, 'cause you can just
date the father of your child.

234
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,973
Turns out you can.

235
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:56,791
It's been a fun six weeks.
We're taking things slowly

236
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,990
And just getting to
know each other again.

237
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:02,321
Except for the fact that you've known
each other for more than 30 years.

238
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:06,431
Okay, I get it. Please get off my back,
and stop talking like this.

239
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:10,680
Okay, it's just that you and Luke
haven't been broken up all that long.

240
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:14,101
I know. I remember.
I was there.

241
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:19,503
Okay.  It's -- you know, after
breaking up out of a big relationship

242
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,590
it's normal to have
a rebound thing.

243
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:25,061
You know, a big, bouncy,
rubber ball of a rebound thing.

244
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:27,021
- It's... good.
- But?

245
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,812
But a rubber ball is
a 28-year-old surfer

246
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:33,023
or a jazz saxophonist
who drives a V.W. bus

247
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:34,993
or a really cute guy that
can't even spell his last name.

248
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:37,060
It's not the father
of your only child.

249
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:39,932
Christopher is not
your rubber ball.

250
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:40,752
Okay.

251
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,122
He's a big, heavy bowling ball.

252
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,571
I'm gonna tell
him you said that.

253
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:45,840
I just want you to be careful.

254
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:48,680
Okay, God, I feel like I should
set up traffic cones around me

255
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:51,333
for all the people
worrying about my safety.

256
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:53,583
I am being careful, okay?

257
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:54,433
That's all I want.

258
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,830
- All right.
- Great.

259
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:56,740
- Fine.
- Good.

260
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,013
- Good.
- Better.

261
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,400
Hi, Chris.

262
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,261
So Lor, what's your life
looking like tomorrow night?

263
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:02,232
You available?

264
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,683
Well, I don't know,
is there some particular reason

265
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:05,710
you're checking
my availability?

266
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,693
Well, I have an idea
for a really fun date,

267
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,511
and if, in fact,
you are available,

268
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:13,521
I will put thought into action.

269
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:15,410
I thought our last
date was pretty fun.

270
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:16,793
Well, this will
be even more fun.

271
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,732
"Snakes on a boat"?!

272
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:20,823
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

273
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:23,242
Okay,  I'll be there at
6:00 to be picked up.

274
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:28,012
Sorry. These gourd
rinds are really thick.

275
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:29,723
What is the, uh, fun date?

276
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:30,860
No hints.

277
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:32,290
I hate not knowing things.

278
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,270
I know. I'll see you tomorrow.

279
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:36,013
Okay. Bye.

280
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:38,173
Sounds like somebody's
got a date.

281
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:40,003
- Sookie.
- Sorry.

282
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,952
- Sounds like somebody's got a date.
- Nice.

283
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:15,141
Hey, this is Logan Huntzberger.
Leave a message.

284
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:17,050
Hey, it's me.

285
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,061
I just got back to Yale.

286
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:21,953
I thought I would try you
and see if you're there,

287
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,511
but you're not.

288
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,752
I thought you would be,
but you're not.

289
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:29,150
Fascinating, my thought process,
isn't it?

290
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:31,750
Okay, I'll talk to
you later. Bye.

291
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:37,453
Hey!

292
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,043
Well, hello, Rory.
You sound chipper.

293
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:41,712
Oh, hi, grandpa.

294
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,103
You're back at Yale?

295
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:45,141
Yep. Back at Yale.

296
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,482
Tell her the good
news, Richard!

297
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:47,630
I'm coming to that.

298
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,583
- It's very exciting!
- What's exciting?

299
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:52,852
Well, when I was at my
Yale class reunion,

300
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:56,991
I had a chance to meet one of my
former classmates, Harold Laken.

301
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:59,852
You know him as the dean of
undergraduate education.

302
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:01,653
Harold was also a
fellow Whiffenpoof.

303
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,691
- The news, Richard!
- Yes, right. Well...

304
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:08,701
It seems there was a sudden vacancy
in the economics department,

305
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:11,352
and they need someone to
teach a course this semester,

306
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:13,951
and Harold immediately
thought of me.

307
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,643
Can you believe it?
Your grandfather, a professor!

308
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:18,530
I'm just a visiting lecturer.

309
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,593
Too starchy. Too starchy?

310
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:22,892
- No, I like -- I like --
- Too starchy.

311
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,982
What I want to know is whether
you'd be okay with this.

312
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:27,861
I'm gonna be on the campus
at the same time you are,

313
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,062
and there's a chance we
might run into one another.

314
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,043
I promise,
you will not cramp my style.

315
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,413
Well, that's wonderful,
because I have to admit,

316
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:36,252
I'm really quite
excited about it.

317
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:38,190
That's great,
grandpa. Congratulations.

318
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:40,491
Well, why don't we meet
up after your first class

319
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:42,561
and grab dinner and celebrate?

320
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:44,093
Oh, I would love that,

321
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:46,860
but I've already scheduled
dinner with Harold.

322
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:49,971
But, Richard, we have dinner
with the Sudburys on thursday.

323
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:51,490
Remember? We're going
to the Hill House.

324
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:54,041
Well, I'm sorry, Emily,
but I have dinner with the dean,

325
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:56,582
and you can't expect me to
include the Sudburys in that.

326
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,070
They are insufferable bores.

327
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:59,502
No,  of course not.

328
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:02,031
I'll just have to have dinner
with the Sudburys alone.

329
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:04,602
Oh, the life of
a faculty widow!

330
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,023
Did you hear that, Rory?
She's already turned on me.

331
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:08,601
I heard it, grandpa.

332
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:12,363
Razor blades? They've expressly
forbidden razor blades?

333
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:13,572
That's sound policy.

334
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,822
Are kids at this school
showing up with razor blades?

335
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:18,132
I mean, listen to this list
of stuff they've had to ban.

336
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:21,422
Drug use, bullying, graffiti,
theft, spitting, fighting --

337
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:25,341
including but not limited to punching,
kicking, gouging, and biting.

338
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,282
Seems to me like they're
just giving the kids ideas.

339
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,452
"Gee, I can't think of any
other bad things to do today.

340
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:32,641
Let me look at the manual.
Hey, gouging sounds fun!"

341
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:34,943
No one at that school
is gouging anyone.

342
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:37,661
Well, sure. Why bother with
that when they've got access to

343
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,043
guns, tasers, knives,
and nunchakus?

344
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:42,663
Nunchakus are cool --
and deadly.

345
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:45,303
That's ridiculous. Nobody's bringing
nunchakus to April's school.

346
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:46,672
Of course not.

347
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,323
They're way too bulky
to fit in your sock.

348
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:49,973
- Now, mace, on the other hand --
- Mace?

349
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:51,123
Kids are walking
around with mace?

350
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:53,702
Oh, honey, calm down.
Nothing's gonna happen to April.

351
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:56,542
They just spell out that stuff
for their legal protection.

352
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:59,253
Whenever you're taking care of kids,
that's a lot of liability.

353
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:00,802
It's the same with
my dance school.

354
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,313
And nothing bad ever happens?

355
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:03,662
Nothing ever happens.

356
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,741
Oh, except for that one time.

357
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:07,133
What one time?

358
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:08,721
Well, I took my
senior ballerinas

359
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:10,911
to try out for a performance
of "The nutcracker,"

360
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:12,893
and one of the girls
pulled a Tonya Harding

361
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:15,522
and knocked the front-runner for
Clara out of the competition.

362
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:17,112
Broke her leg in three places.

363
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,853
That is not nothing.
That is the opposite of nothing.

364
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:22,953
It's totally different.
That was a much rougher crowd.

365
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,903
Rougher crowd?
They're ballerinas.

366
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:26,200
Oh, yeah. I know.

367
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:29,540
Everyone thinks, "ballerinas --
so sweet, so fragile."

368
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,793
Trust me,
they're dancing on stress fractures

369
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:35,241
and ingrown toenails,
and they haven't eaten in weeks.

370
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:36,773
- Hey.
- Sorry we're late.

371
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:38,143
We were half-way here
and April remembered

372
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:40,860
the avocado pit was still in the
kitchen, so we had to go back.

373
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:43,083
We had to make to
make a pit stop.

374
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:44,950
- Hey, honey.
- Hi!

375
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,873
- You remember miss Patty.
- Sure!

376
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:48,151
- And Kirk.
- Yo.

377
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:49,293
- And Caesar.
- Hey, April.

378
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:51,613
I hate to have to rush,
but I actually have to rush.

379
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,982
That's fine. You go.

380
00:15:52,997 --> 00:15:55,332
- Bye, mom.
- Ooh, I love you, sweetie.

381
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:56,673
- Say hi to grandma.
- I will.

382
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:58,943
- I'll call you when I get there.
- Okay.

383
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,060
Take care of her.

384
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,192
I will.

385
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,930
Okay, then.

386
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,510
So, is there somewhere
I can put the pit down?

387
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:12,272
Oh, you know what?
Go on upstairs, and I'll bring the bags.

388
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:18,051
Look at that turnout.
And the hips of Anna Pavlova.

389
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,441
You must bring her
to my ballet class.

390
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:23,053
Where ballerinas are maiming each
other to be in "The nutcracker"?

391
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:25,243
Fat chance of that.

392
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:30,742
Okay, here we are.

393
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,531
You remember the place.

394
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,111
All right.

395
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:37,511
Here's your bed,
and here's the desk.

396
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,051
I thought you could do
your homework on it.

397
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:41,420
A little chair for reading.
I know how you like reading.

398
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:43,462
And this is your dresser.

399
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:45,791
Now, if you have a hanging bag for,
like, dresses,

400
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,813
you can just hang it in my closet,
but I don't seem to remember

401
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:51,073
- you wearing a lot of dresses.
- Not big on dresses.

402
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:54,731
All right, what else?
Here's your kitchen, my bed,

403
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:57,512
bathroom's back there,
and the TV.

404
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,212
I had a remote but I lost it,

405
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:02,712
so you're gonna have to change the
channel by turning this knob here.

406
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:04,430
And here's the telephone.

407
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:07,600
If you're on it and you hear a
beeping sound, that's call-waiting,

408
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:11,001
So you've got to hit the flash button
to switch over to the other call.

409
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:12,573
Maybe I should
write all this down.

410
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:13,561
Oh, sure! Sure!

411
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,080
I was just kidding.
I know how call-waiting works.

412
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:17,792
Of course you do.

413
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:21,202
You probably also know how to open up
a refrigerator and turn on a sink.

414
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:23,400
Okay, well,
I'll get out of your way,

415
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,310
and you let me know if
you need anything. Okay?

416
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:28,452
Actually, my avocado
pit needs light,

417
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,180
and it's kind of dark in here.

418
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:33,582
Well, there will be a little
more light in the morning.

419
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:36,160
Will there be less
brown in the morning?

420
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:39,411
You know, this place is kind
of depressing, isn't it?

421
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:41,313
I'd say.

422
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:43,470
Sorry if that hurt
your feelings.

423
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:47,472
Mom says bluntness isn't my
most attractive quality.

424
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:49,580
Well, maybe we can
pick up a few things.

425
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:51,492
I don't know,
some pillows, a rug.

426
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,191
You know, lamps --
lamps brighten.

427
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,673
Hey, we could go to "targét."

428
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,190
Oh, sounds kind of fancy.

429
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:58,021
No. No,
that's just how we say "Target."

430
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,790
Oh, never been.

431
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:02,372
Wow. Um...

432
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:05,091
I don't think I've ever met a
person who hasn't been to Target.

433
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:07,623
Well, now you have,
so if you say that's the place to go,

434
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:09,781
- so that's where we'll go.
- It's the place to go.

435
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,511
Okay, so how about tomorrow,
after I close up?

436
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:13,571
- Cool.
- Cool!

437
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:15,360
- I'll let you get settled in.
- Okay.

438
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:16,730
All right.

439
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:30,763
Everyone, congratulations.

440
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:34,050
The first issue of the year
is officially locked down.

441
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:36,583
And special kudos to Bill
for landing the front page

442
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,680
with his campus housing exposé,

443
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:40,390
"Dormitory or death trap?"

444
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:41,403
Nice alliteration.

445
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:42,702
Slugline's half the battle.

446
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:45,062
Dormitory renovations --
that's quaint.

447
00:18:45,078 --> 00:18:47,910
I recently had the opportunity to be a
fly on the wall at the Hartford courant

448
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:49,970
as the editor selected
their lead story.

449
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:52,470
It was down to the wire,
and I was on the edge of my seat

450
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:55,162
when at the last second,
a local-corruption story broke.

451
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,602
It was thrilling.
It made this place look like a joke.

452
00:18:57,617 --> 00:18:59,670
- Your point, Paris?
- Oh, I thought I was clear.

453
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:01,780
Compared to the courant,
this place is a joke.

454
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:03,271
Okay. Assignments.

455
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:05,511
Bill, you'll go with part two
of the campus-housing series.

456
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:06,141
Got it.

457
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:08,183
We need someone to cover the
board of trustees meeting.

458
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:09,693
- I'm on that.
- Thanks, Joni.

459
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,883
And I want to do the traditional
freshman class composition article,

460
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,833
but I think we need to go deeper
than just ethnicities and hometowns.

461
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:18,292
I mean,
what is the class of 2010 really about?

462
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:19,742
Maybe take a different look.

463
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,952
At the courant, they use indesign to
integrate the words into the photos.

464
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:24,872
Gee, Paris, do you happen to
have an "in" at the courant?

465
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:26,643
Like, maybe your
boyfriend, Doyle?

466
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:27,853
What is he, a fact-checker?

467
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,133
The most requested
fact-checker at the paper.

468
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:32,301
He works seven days a week just
to keep up with the demand

469
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:33,442
for his fact-checking.

470
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,642
Maybe he's looking to get
away from a certain lunatic.

471
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:36,932
Jealous much, Sheila?

472
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,460
Yeah. You got me.

473
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:41,281
So, the art-show piece.
I've got a problem.

474
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:42,792
Animal, vegetable, or mineral?

475
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,283
I kind of had a thing with one
of the artists in the show.

476
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:46,340
Okay. Animal.

477
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:47,483
I just can't do it.

478
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:48,821
That's fine. I can do it.

479
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:51,281
That's it. Class dismissed.

480
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:53,840
So, you want to go to this
art-show thing with me tonight?

481
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,200
Sorry, can't, Doyle's celebrating his
one-month anniversary with the paper.

482
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:59,432
Having drinks with a bunch of the
staff bigwigs over at Duffy's.

483
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,692
- Cool.
- Yeah.

484
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:02,790
He's pretty loved.
Actually, we both are.

485
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:04,681
We're like the Ephron and
Bernstein of the group.

486
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:06,293
I think it's going
to be quite a fete.

487
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:08,733
Doyle says the editor of the
metro section might even show.

488
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,491
That's cool.
Well, I can just go by myself.

489
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:13,283
You know, if you're desperate, you could
force one of these staffers to go with you.

490
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:14,990
I used to do that all the
time when I was the editor.

491
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,161
I dragged Bill everywhere.

492
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:18,371
That is, until the time I picked
him up to go to the groundbreaking

493
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:19,761
for the new chemistry
research building,

494
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:21,313
and he was wearing
a cable-knit sweater

495
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:24,101
that had "date" written all over it.
As if.

496
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:25,501
I'm not desperate.

497
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,943
Look, don't give me those
Rory Gilmore puppy-dog eyes.

498
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:30,921
Even if I am your best friend,
I have to look out for my career first,

499
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:32,492
then Doyle's, then you.

500
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:33,560
Go to your party, Paris.

501
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:35,550
Be the couple whose
divorce was so painful

502
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,582
that it was memorialized in both
literature and film. I'll be fine.

503
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:41,323
Oh, yeah. Now it's just sad.

504
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:52,100
Huh!

505
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,291
Um... kind of, uh, casual,

506
00:20:55,305 --> 00:20:57,511
seemingly routine
dating clothes.

507
00:20:57,527 --> 00:20:59,213
Was that intended
as a compliment?

508
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:01,211
'Cause it didn't
come out like one.

509
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,530
No, you look good.

510
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:04,832
But I mean, how hard is it to look
good when you know where you're going?

511
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:07,092
- Not that hard.
- I could get some points.

512
00:21:07,108 --> 00:21:08,903
I, on the other hand,
had to come up with an outfit

513
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:11,473
that could easily convert from
totally formal to totally casual

514
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:13,291
with just a few moves.

515
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:14,761
Look, here I am, all ready

516
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:17,440
for an elegant,
New York night on the town,

517
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:19,310
carriage ride through the park,

518
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:21,672
dinner at Pastis,
drinks at the Algonquin,

519
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:25,183
but if I change my shoes
and throw on a cardigan

520
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:26,573
and add necklace number two,

521
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:29,152
then I am ready for a concert
at the New Haven Green,

522
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:31,861
or I could use my cardigan to
cover up the security camera

523
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:34,391
in case the date turns
into some sort of heist.

524
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,213
I'd prefer the sexy
shoes to the sandals,

525
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:37,771
but you should be comfortable.

526
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:39,331
Comfortable?

527
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:42,242
"Comfortable" like we're gonna
eat moroccan and sit on the floor,

528
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:44,980
or "comfortable" like
we're gonna go up steps?

529
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:47,683
Steps? Steps? Steps?
Are we going to the Mets?

530
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,423
No hints.

531
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:51,892
So, tell me now.

532
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:53,543
Now! Tell me!

533
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:56,362
Oh, hello, "Bullitt."
Are you taking me on a car chase

534
00:21:56,378 --> 00:21:57,810
through the streets
of San Francisco?

535
00:21:57,846 --> 00:21:59,150
- It's cool, right?
- It's really cool.

536
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,353
- You like it?
- I love it.

537
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:02,633
- So is this the thing?
- It's a thing.

538
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:04,583
But is this the special
thing you planned?

539
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:06,343
'Cause if it is,
I want to give it its due.

540
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:08,743
If it's not, I want to have
the proper level of enjoyment

541
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:11,392
while still reserving myself
for the actual special thing.

542
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:13,413
The car is part of the thing.
It's not the whole thing.

543
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:14,590
I don't want to peek too soon.

544
00:22:14,628 --> 00:22:15,601
Yeah, that's never good.

545
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,453
Ooh, you're being a gentleman.
Is that the special thing?

546
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,541
I always open your door.

547
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,781
Bucket seats --
is that the special thing?

548
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:23,861
No? Take a good,
long look at my hair now

549
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,932
'cause it's not gonna look like
this for the rest of the night.

550
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:30,752
Rumbly engine --
is that the special thing?

551
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,981
Buckle your seatbelt.

552
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:34,041
Buckling my seatbelt --
is that the special thing?

553
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:36,511
Yeah, that's it.
You're all buckled up. Date's over.

554
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:41,882
Look at this --
12-pack of socks for $6.

555
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:45,710
24 socks for 6 bucks.
That's only 25 cents a sock..

556
00:22:45,725 --> 00:22:46,930
I knew you'd like it.

557
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,312
Oh, this looks good.

558
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,392
- You picked it out.
- Well, you said tablecloth.

559
00:22:50,405 --> 00:22:51,353
That's true.

560
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:52,833
And what's the name
of that blue again?

561
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:55,363
Uh, cerulean.
I'm really into cerulean.

562
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:56,860
Yeah, I can see why.

563
00:22:56,877 --> 00:23:00,781
I used to be really into olive.
Everything was olive, you know?

564
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,723
It was my backpack, my pants, 
my sneakers. It was all olive.

565
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:05,910
And then one day, I just --
I woke up,

566
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:09,381
and I was like, "olive?
I don't like olive.

567
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:12,712
Not to wear, not to eat.
Olive -- Bleh."

568
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:15,280
Well, you know what?
I'm really glad we did it.

569
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:17,571
We had fun,
and the place looks great.

570
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:19,590
And, you know, now,
anytime you want,

571
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:22,492
you can have a nice
dinner on this table.

572
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:23,753
That's true.

573
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,480
You could put
flowers in this vase

574
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:28,383
- and use it like a centerpiece.
- Uh-huh.

575
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:32,000
You could dim the lights,
light these candles.

576
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:34,253
You know,
we can do it tonight if you want.

577
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:35,393
Yeah.

578
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:39,443
Or, you know, you could do it
when you have a lady over.

579
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:40,500
Oh?

580
00:23:40,516 --> 00:23:43,372
It'd be really nice.

581
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:47,073
And she would be totally
comfortable in here now.

582
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,850
Right. Uh, you know what?

583
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:50,761
Why don't we, uh,
set up the desk lamp

584
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:52,340
so you can get at
your homework?

585
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:54,320
Actually, they don't give homework
on the first day of school.

586
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:56,070
One teacher said he was
gonna give us homework.

587
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:58,473
He even wrote it on the board,
but the homework was just,

588
00:23:58,486 --> 00:24:00,933
"cover your books."
How lame is that?

589
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:02,651
- Very lame.
- I know.

590
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,233
So I'll set it up so you
can get to it tomorrow.

591
00:24:05,248 --> 00:24:07,370
Cool. Um,
I'm gonna start covering my books.

592
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:08,872
Can I grab some grocery bags?

593
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:10,882
Yeah, go for it.
It's under the sink.

594
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,301
You know,
you can admit it if you're lost.

595
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,943
I will not lose any
respect for you.

596
00:24:23,957 --> 00:24:25,591
I'm not lost.

597
00:24:25,606 --> 00:24:27,411
Well, then,
are you planning to murder me?

598
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,181
Because people will
notice I'm gone.

599
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:30,443
They'll look for me.

600
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:33,160
Paul Anka saw me leave with you.
He'll bark.

601
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:35,740
He will bark,
and he'll sell you down the river.

602
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:38,240
Chris! Chris!

603
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:43,693
Good. Finally asking
for directions.

604
00:24:43,707 --> 00:24:45,461
We're here.

605
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:48,701
Here, where? Are we at Woodstock?
I think we're late.

606
00:24:48,715 --> 00:24:51,180
Shh! Just give it a minute.

607
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:54,312
Oh, are we meditating?
I think you need a word to repeat.

608
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,390
I don't have a word.

609
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:56,432
Stop talking.

610
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:57,703
That's two words.

611
00:24:57,716 --> 00:24:58,930
Shh.

612
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:00,092
Oh.

613
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:01,520
"Shh." I like it.

614
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:03,133
Shh...

615
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:05,502
Ooh! What the --

616
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:28,343
I love this movie.

617
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:31,350
Check the glove compartment.

618
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:35,161
Oh, my god.

619
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:36,913
Hold this.

620
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:39,781
And...

621
00:25:40,227 --> 00:25:41,953
popcorn.

622
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:44,632
Oh, my god.
You're unbelievable!

623
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:48,231
I thought it was time we saw a
movie we wouldn't complain about.

624
00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:01,883
"Good morning, Mr. Ascot."

625
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:08,282
Mm-hmm.
But I have to tell you, Emily,

626
00:26:08,298 --> 00:26:10,561
it's a whole new world
from the one we remember.

627
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:12,363
But the jacket was
still appropriate?

628
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:13,850
Oh, the jacket was fine.

629
00:26:13,868 --> 00:26:16,172
Although I must say,
I felt wildly overdressed.

630
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:19,611
Boys in undershirts and
filthy baseball caps --

631
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:21,920
the girls wearing
pajamas and flip-flops.

632
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:23,822
Well, it's the style, Richard.

633
00:26:23,837 --> 00:26:25,431
Well, it's most peculiar.

634
00:26:25,448 --> 00:26:27,871
And you were firm with them?
That's one thing that never changes.

635
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:29,923
Young people respond
to discipline.

636
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:32,520
After all, you don't want your
course to be known as a "gut."

637
00:26:32,535 --> 00:26:33,811
That's an easy class.

638
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:35,981
I learned that term at
dinner with the Sudburys,

639
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:37,833
who learned it from
their grandson, Paul.

640
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:41,631
And how are the Sudburys?
I hope you gave them my regards.

641
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:44,391
Of course. And they sent you theirs
and then proceeded to bore me

642
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:47,131
with the details of every
stunning vista they witnessed

643
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:49,180
on their recent
cruise to Alaska.

644
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:53,042
If you ask me, they saw more of the
baked Alaska than anything else.

645
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:56,150
You poor thing.
You have a disappointing evening,

646
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,612
and I have to give
you the bum's rush

647
00:26:57,647 --> 00:27:00,093
to make my dinner with
Harold at the faculty club.

648
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:01,951
That's all right.
You enjoy yourself.

649
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:04,272
I probably won't wait up,
so I'll say good night now.

650
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:06,182
Good night, dear.

651
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:15,800
Oh, for Pete's sake! What now?

652
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,233
License and
registration, please?

653
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:31,551
Why do you need to see my license?
I wasn't speeding.

654
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,090
You were on a cellphone, ma'am.

655
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:34,481
I don't see how
that's your concern.

656
00:27:34,515 --> 00:27:36,260
Do my bills go to your office?

657
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:38,560
It is illegal in Connecticut
to talk on a cellphone

658
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:40,132
while operating a vehicle.

659
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:43,570
Well, that is absurd. I can't talk
on my own phone in my own car?

660
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:45,770
License and
registration, ma'am.

661
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:48,820
If I can manage to drink a
cup of hot coffee and drive,

662
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:50,342
I can talk on a cellphone.

663
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:51,973
Or is coffee illegal, too?

664
00:27:51,988 --> 00:27:53,273
Can I listen to the radio?

665
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:54,663
Can I open the
glove compartment?

666
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,111
Perhaps you should outlaw
scratching your nose.

667
00:27:57,127 --> 00:27:59,723
That would certainly
cut down on accidents.

668
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:01,421
Ma'am, have you been drinking?

669
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:03,511
What? No!

670
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:05,051
This is outrageous.

671
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:07,353
You know, right now,
someone is robbing a kwiki mart,

672
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:09,730
and you're standing
there harassing me.

673
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:13,260
I'm going to need you to blow
into this breathalyzer for me.

674
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:16,603
Young man,
I don't know where that's been,

675
00:28:16,615 --> 00:28:18,381
but I can say with
absolute certainty

676
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:21,651
it won't be going
anywhere near my mouth.

677
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,723
Excuse me. Do you know what
the light bulbs are all about?

678
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:46,382
Shock in your system.

679
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:48,153
Effective.

680
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:00,913
What are you doing?

681
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:02,470
Um, me?

682
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:03,723
She's touching your art.

683
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:06,760
What are you doing?
Are you actually drinking that water?

684
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,300
Oh, um,
I didn't know that it was art.

685
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,632
I thought it was
just a water cooler.

686
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:13,100
There's no sign or anything.

687
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:14,290
"Just a water cooler."

688
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:16,621
That's her self-portrait.

689
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,880
I'm kidding!
It's just a water cooler.

690
00:29:19,895 --> 00:29:20,901
Oh. Okay.

691
00:29:20,918 --> 00:29:23,012
We were just messing with you.
She is an artist, though.

692
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,060
I made the horse.

693
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:25,631
Oh, I really like that one.

694
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:26,722
Well, thanks.

695
00:29:26,738 --> 00:29:29,102
Yes. It looks really big, too.
It looks bigger than the doorway.

696
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:30,522
Yeah. Well, it turns out it is,

697
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:32,920
as I found out four hours
before the show gonna start.

698
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,673
I had to detach the head,
then reattach it when I got here.

699
00:29:35,685 --> 00:29:37,073
Does it look crooked?

700
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:38,141
Um, not to me.

701
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:39,600
- No, it does.
- If it does look crooked,

702
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:43,022
which it doesn't, I think it looks
better then it did before -- more jaunty.

703
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:44,053
What's it made out of?

704
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,331
Cans mostly. Tinfoil.
A couple hubcaps.

705
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:47,761
I do stuff with found objects.

706
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:50,161
I mean, you could call it trash,
but that'd be kind of negative.

707
00:29:50,197 --> 00:29:51,782
She once made this
sculpture of an old lady

708
00:29:51,815 --> 00:29:53,601
out of plastic sandwich
bags and milk cartons,

709
00:29:53,635 --> 00:29:55,083
which was so cool.
She's awesome.

710
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,253
Oh, shut up!

711
00:29:56,268 --> 00:29:57,920
So you're Olivia Marquont?

712
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,300
- Impressive.
- What are you, a spy?

713
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:02,430
Actually, I'm here for the paper.
I'm Rory.

714
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:04,913
Oh, the press.
So what do you think?

715
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:07,513
Honestly, I don't know.
I like your piece,

716
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:09,810
and I think I like the
robot in the underpants.

717
00:30:09,828 --> 00:30:11,091
The robot is genius.

718
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:12,863
Olivia thinks
everything is genius.

719
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,970
Only genius stuff.

720
00:30:13,988 --> 00:30:15,362
So, you're on the paper?

721
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:16,821
Oh, my god,
we used to be totally obsessed

722
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,112
with this girl who was on the paper --
Paris Geller.

723
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:20,582
- Sure.
- You know Paris?

724
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:22,410
- I know Paris.
- Okay, freshman year,

725
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:24,513
we were in this moral-reasoning
class with Paris,

726
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:27,093
and she was the most intense
person we'd ever met.

727
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:29,252
Um, she's pretty much
like that all the time.

728
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:30,670
Actually, I went to
high school with Paris.

729
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:33,150
Paris geller is a genius,
and I will go to the mat on that one.

730
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:35,312
Okay, you've got to let us
show you the rest of the show.

731
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:36,131
That's cool.

732
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:37,540
Come on.
We'll help you with your article,

733
00:30:37,575 --> 00:30:39,661
give you the skinny
on everyone.

734
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:41,580
Did you see the
light bulb thing?

735
00:30:41,598 --> 00:30:43,520
Um, my retinas
are still ringing.

736
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:45,862
Our friend Joel did that.
He just transferred from M.I.T.

737
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:48,490
Dude's wicked smart.
His work is always about technology.

738
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:49,791
I think Joel's a genius,

739
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:53,022
but I'll admit, I could be biased
by the fact that he's a total fox.

740
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:55,151
Is that the guy in
the '70s prom tuxedo?

741
00:30:55,168 --> 00:30:57,793
No, that's Elijah.
He's doing a performance piece, actually.

742
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:00,573
He's been doing it since we were juniors.
Who knows if it'll ever end?

743
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:02,690
Okay, you've got to see
our friend Kasha's piece.

744
00:31:02,705 --> 00:31:05,741
It's called "Girl without
clothes," and it's far out.

745
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:08,010
# You can't blame me #

746
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:12,430
# For feeling avarice #

747
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:16,562
# Oh, s'wonderful #

748
00:31:16,716 --> 00:31:20,850
# S'marvelous #

749
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:25,353
# That you should care #

750
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:29,850
# For me #

751
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:51,570
Ooh, it's so good!

752
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:55,151
It's so chock-full of...
words like "chock-full."

753
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,773
And even if Audrey
Hepburn was 20

754
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:59,411
- and Fred Astaire was, like, 80 --
- He's still Fred Astaire.

755
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:02,212
I mean,
he could really tap-dance.

756
00:32:02,226 --> 00:32:04,030
That was so nice, Chris.

757
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:07,003
That was so romantic
and fun and wonderful.

758
00:32:07,015 --> 00:32:09,203
- S'wonderful?
- S'marvelous.

759
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:11,781
- I'm glad you liked it.
- I did. I really liked it.

760
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:13,933
You know,
the evening doesn't have to end here.

761
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:16,653
Gigi's staying with my mom.
We could go back to my place.

762
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,112
Oh. That's nice.

763
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,420
- Nice?
- No, that's not what I meant. Um...

764
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:25,042
- We don't have to.
- No, I want to.

765
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:27,342
- You do?
- I do, but I don't know if...

766
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:29,023
- ...you want to.
- ...if I should.

767
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:30,613
Okay.

768
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:35,443
I mean, everything's good, you know?
It's going really good.

769
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:38,421
- It's really good.
- Yeah, and I'm feeling good.

770
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:40,101
But?

771
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:45,382
I don't, uh...
know if I trust you.

772
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,322
Really?

773
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:50,760
Not just you. Me too.

774
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:55,863
I'm not sure if I
trust us yet with this.

775
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:57,561
Oh.

776
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:01,040
It's scary.

777
00:33:01,057 --> 00:33:03,333
I'm scared, too.

778
00:33:03,345 --> 00:33:06,341
I just hoped maybe...

779
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:10,822
we could stay here in this
place for a little while longer.

780
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:13,043
Well, it's gonna
snow eventually.

781
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:14,530
Right.

782
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,241
It's fine. We should wait.

783
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:18,670
I can wait.

784
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:20,740
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

785
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,290
Thank you.

786
00:33:24,977 --> 00:33:27,560
All this is perfect.

787
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:34,401
Okay.

788
00:33:40,138 --> 00:33:41,890
Hello?

789
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,320
This is she.

790
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:46,823
What?

791
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:48,801
Oh. Yes!

792
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:50,543
What is it?
Who are you talking to?

793
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:53,203
Is she okay? What did she --

794
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:57,281
Okay. Where are you?

795
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:59,580
Uh-huh. I know where that is.

796
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,642
I'll be right there. Thank you.

797
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:04,211
Okay, bye-bye.

798
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:05,283
What?

799
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:07,951
We have to go.
We have to pick up my mother --

800
00:34:07,968 --> 00:34:09,932
from jail.

801
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:12,721
Your mother's in jail?

802
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:15,040
Ooh, this night keeps
getting better and better.

803
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:16,452
Let's go.

804
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:29,991
You brush your teeth?

805
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:31,183
They're brushed.

806
00:34:31,197 --> 00:34:33,660
So, there's a clear
path to the bathroom.

807
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:35,180
Can I get you a night-light?

808
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:36,992
I'm 13.

809
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:38,533
I'll take that as a "no."

810
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:39,871
I thought you didn't
have any homework.

811
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:41,621
I don't.
This is more for pleasure.

812
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:44,483
Sure. Sure,
a little light reading before bed.

813
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:46,481
I love my biology teacher.

814
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:49,110
She is so smart,
and she's really pretty.

815
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:51,210
She has this long, brown hair

816
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:53,343
that she kind of just
whooshes up into a clip.

817
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,300
She has all these piercings,
but it's just on one ear,

818
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:57,060
and she likes to fish.

819
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:59,933
No kidding?
A pretty fisher/scientist woman.

820
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:01,381
And I know she's single

821
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:03,413
because last year her
name was Mrs. Johnson,

822
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:06,153
and this year it's Ms.
Kaplan, so I was thinking,

823
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:09,151
one day, I could conveniently
forget my biology book,

824
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:10,833
and you could
bring it by for me,

825
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:13,701
and then maybe you could...

826
00:35:13,716 --> 00:35:16,340
Have dinner at the candlestick
table with Ms. Kaplan?

827
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:18,182
Exactly.

828
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:20,311
Look...

829
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:22,213
April...

830
00:35:23,108 --> 00:35:25,852
I guess you know
Lorelai and I broke up.

831
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:28,381
Yeah, my mom sort of told me.

832
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:30,633
Okay, well,
sometimes that happens, you know?

833
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:33,421
Sometimes it doesn't
work out between people,

834
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:35,121
and it's nobody's fault.

835
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:37,090
It's all about pheromone.

836
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:38,562
Right.

837
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,413
But I want you to
know I'm okay,

838
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:43,343
and you don't have
to take care of me.

839
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,530
I'm here to take care of you.

840
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,072
Okay?

841
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:48,972
Okay.

842
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,832
- Good night.
- Good night.

843
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:55,772
Is it okay if I read a little
more before I turn out the light?

844
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,313
- Real page-turner, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

845
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:59,291
Mitosis is insane.

846
00:35:59,305 --> 00:36:01,302
Knock yourself out.

847
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:07,211
Oh... got it! Thank you!

848
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:09,490
- Am I smiling too much?
- You're smiling a lot.

849
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:11,071
All right,
I'll try to bring it down a notch.

850
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:12,842
Well, it's about time.
Oh, good.

851
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:14,451
I get to walk this
filthy floor again.

852
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,050
I don't need any help walking.
Thank you!

853
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:20,321
Oh, thank you for giving me
things that already belong to me.

854
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:23,013
Well, you can all be very
proud of yourselves.

855
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:24,382
You're doing a crack job.

856
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:27,221
You finally got menace-to-society
Emily Gilmore off the streets.

857
00:36:27,237 --> 00:36:29,013
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

858
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:31,300
Come on. Put that thing away.

859
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:33,050
One, two, three! Ah!

860
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,851
Smile! Cheese!

861
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:38,311
Oh, I got you already. I'll get --
Okay, later. Bye!

862
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:43,250
Do you mind if I turn
on the music, mom?

863
00:36:43,265 --> 00:36:44,471
That's fine.

864
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:46,660
Whatcha in the mood for?
"Jailhouse rock"?

865
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:47,870
"Folsom prison blues"?

866
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:49,253
You're very funny, Lorelai.

867
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:52,071
No, no, no. I know, I know.
"Working on the chain gang."

868
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:54,132
Yes, it's all quite amusing,
isn't it?

869
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,382
My being arrested,
held behind bars,

870
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:58,930
manhandled, and patted down?
Hardee-har.

871
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:01,313
Aw. I just have one
question for you, mom.

872
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:03,052
Why on earth did you call me?

873
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:05,452
I mean, thank you very much
from the bottom of my heart

874
00:37:05,465 --> 00:37:06,871
for that incredible gift.

875
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:08,992
You don't need to get me anything
for the next five Christmases.

876
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:10,972
But why did you call me,
not dad?

877
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:13,002
It was his first night
teaching at Yale.

878
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:14,311
He was having dinner
with the dean.

879
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:16,373
I'm not about to call him
so he can excuse himself

880
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:18,902
to come bail his
wife out of jail.

881
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:22,293
I can't begin to tell you how
incompetent our police department is.

882
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,252
That officer Peters
who pulled me over --

883
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:26,661
he's going to be receiving a big,
fat subpoena,

884
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,003
and I'm not stopping there.

885
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:31,023
Wait.

886
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:33,963
What is this? What's this car?

887
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:36,323
What's going on here?

888
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,583
Are you two on a date?

889
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:40,601
No way.
You are not changing the subject.

890
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:42,941
We're not talking about anything
else except you in the clink.

891
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:45,803
Now, come on. Spill.
What was it like on the inside, huh?

892
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:48,133
Did you try to tunnel your
way out with a spoon?

893
00:37:48,148 --> 00:37:50,341
You know ? Did they try to make
you join a gang?

894
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:52,312
And, mom,
now that you're on the outside

895
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:53,511
and they're still
on the inside,

896
00:37:53,546 --> 00:37:55,860
are they gonna try to use you
as some kind of prison mule?

897
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:59,442
I just --
so much I need to know!

898
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,861
So, after my third callback,
he says to me,

899
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:07,523
"a girl can't play Oscar Wilde. I want
people to take this production seriously,"

900
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,290
like he's Peter
Brook or something

901
00:38:09,306 --> 00:38:11,773
And not some goateed
sophomore from Arkansas.

902
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:13,671
So I give him my most
foppish stare and say,

903
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:15,812
"life is too important
to be taken seriously."

904
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:16,520
Nice.

905
00:38:16,536 --> 00:38:18,871
But on the way out,
as I'm making my dramatic exit,

906
00:38:18,888 --> 00:38:21,243
I walk right into the glass door,
like smack.

907
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,340
No. Ouch!

908
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:25,452
So the next semester, he keeps
hounding me about how I'd be perfect

909
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:27,060
for his production of
"California suite"

910
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:30,263
because I have such a
gift for physical comedy.

911
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:34,110
Holy crap!
Your boyfriend is rich.

912
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:36,732
And he's got some wild stuff.

913
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,090
I mean, what's this about?

914
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,193
Well, I must eat.
I'm positively famished.

915
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:44,453
Nice sound system.

916
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:46,692
Do you have popcorn?

917
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,442
Um, yeah,
there should be some in there.

918
00:38:49,526 --> 00:38:51,890
You have a hell of a lot
of rice in here, Rory.

919
00:38:51,906 --> 00:38:54,331
White rice, brown rice,
long-stem rice.

920
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:55,930
You are simply crazy for rice.

921
00:38:55,946 --> 00:38:57,492
Who doesn't like rice?

922
00:38:57,506 --> 00:39:00,402
Look who found an air popper!

923
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:01,651
Genius.

924
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,032
Now we just need some popcorn.

925
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:04,963
Or something else that
could be cooked in here.

926
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:08,772
Rice. Who's up for a late-night
snack of air-popped rice?

927
00:39:08,787 --> 00:39:10,720
Oh, wow,
that must be my Logan call.

928
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:12,672
I didn't realize it
was so late already.

929
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,640
Time flies when you're
partying with an artist.

930
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:15,522
Hey!

931
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:17,030
- Hey.
- Hi.

932
00:39:17,048 --> 00:39:18,871
What's going on?
You having a party there, Ace?

933
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:20,762
Oh, no, I'm just hanging out 
with a few friends.

934
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,283
- Just friends, huh?
- Yeah.

935
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:23,611
Anybody I know, or...?

936
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,281
No. Just some girls I met.

937
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:27,483
- Hi, Logan!
- Hi, Logan!

938
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,711
Just girls, huh?
Your new boyfriend's not over.

939
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:31,883
Nope. Just us girls hanging
out in our underwear,

940
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:34,212
throwing pillows at each other --
you know, girl stuff.

941
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:36,312
Sounds very wholesome and loud.

942
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:38,312
- Yeah, we're --
- Hey, Rory!

943
00:39:38,327 --> 00:39:40,191
Hold on just a sec. Yeah?

944
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:42,852
This says it's popcorn,
but it looks so fancy.

945
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:45,792
Can I open it, or are you saving it
for a special occasion or something?

946
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:47,302
Go ahead.

947
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:48,823
Hey, uh, sorry.

948
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:50,861
Is it okay if I call
you back later?

949
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:52,371
Sure, no problem. Have fun.

950
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:54,450
I will. Love you. Bye.

951
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:58,293
Is that too much popcorn?

952
00:39:58,307 --> 00:40:00,810
- Uh, yeah.
- I'm really hungry.

953
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:05,592
Okay. Someone's got
some explaining to do.

954
00:40:07,758 --> 00:40:10,270
I mean, they escorted her
out in her stocking feet.

955
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:11,382
Her shoes in a bag.

956
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:12,951
Somewhere in my
youth or childhood...

957
00:40:12,966 --> 00:40:14,673
...you must have
done something good.

958
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:16,260
The universe owed me this one.

959
00:40:16,278 --> 00:40:18,432
- I'm glad you had fun.
- I did. Didn't you have fun?

960
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:20,111
Yeah, I did. It was great.

961
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,253
It was one of the
"great" greats. What?

962
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:25,091
Nothing. I feel I may have
gotten overshadowed a bit.

963
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:27,021
I mean, how's my little barn
movie supposed to compare

964
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:28,410
with your mom in jail?

965
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,581
Chris, no!

966
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,472
It was just the cherry on top,

967
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:35,910
the mint on the pillow of what
was already a perfect night.

968
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:38,742
No, I loved our date.
It was amazing.

969
00:40:38,758 --> 00:40:39,990
I loved the movie.

970
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:42,903
I'll never forget the movie I saw the
night I picked my mother up from jail.

971
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:44,640
You're never gonna get tired
of saying that, are you?

972
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,490
"Picked up my mom from jail"?
No, I don't think I ever will.

973
00:40:47,507 --> 00:40:50,001
I'm just so glad you
were with me tonight.

974
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:53,901
I mean, anybody else who
would have seen me laughing

975
00:40:53,915 --> 00:40:55,463
as I bailed my
mother out of jail

976
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:57,213
would have just thought I
was completely deranged.

977
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:01,203
Well, I know you're deranged but
for completely different reasons.

978
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:03,603
I mean, you just get it,

979
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:06,120
and you make everything fun,

980
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:09,252
and it's so nice to be with
someone who understands you

981
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,311
and makes you...

982
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:21,760
I'll call you tomorrow.

983
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:26,003
- Gigi's with her grandmother?
- She is.

984
00:41:27,497 --> 00:41:29,403
You want to come in?

985
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:31,432
Yeah?

986
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:36,832
Yeah.
