1
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,381
The redcoats are coming!
The redcoats are coming!

2
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:24,773
The redcoats are coming!

3
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:27,019
Whoa, whoa.
Hold on there, missy.

4
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,069
Got to put on your
jacket first, okay?

5
00:00:30,723 --> 00:00:32,177
- Hi!
- Hi!

6
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,401
- I'm so mad at you!
- What kind of greeting is that?

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,186
What kind of daughter doesn't let her
mother pick her up at the airport?

8
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,229
The kind of daughter who parks
her car at the airport car park.

9
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:40,330
But I'm the kind of mother who picks
her daughter up from the airport.

10
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:42,438
You know, with flowers and coffee
and a fake chauffeur's sign.

11
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:43,878
Why would you mess
with my sense of self?

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,718
But my car was parked at
the airport car park.

13
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,594
So what? I could have driven to the
airport, picked you up, brought you back.

14
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,829
Then we both could have driven to
pick up your car and come back here.

15
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:52,702
Yeah, 'cause that wouldn't be
a waste of gas or anything.

16
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:55,482
Oh. Oh, God.
Did you pack Big Ben?

17
00:00:55,497 --> 00:00:56,919
I still think it
was kind of risky.

18
00:00:56,935 --> 00:00:57,619
What's risky?

19
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,106
You've spent a lot of
time across the pond.

20
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:02,059
You might get confused and forget
which side of the road to drive on.

21
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:03,711
Yes, it was a near escape.

22
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,445
Hey! Welcome home!

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,950
The redcoat is here!

24
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,303
Hi, dad!

25
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,885
- How are you doing?
- Good.

26
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,297
Hi, little sister.

27
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:13,510
Oh, hello. Okay. Oh.

28
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,306
Oh. Well, all right.

29
00:01:16,153 --> 00:01:17,847
- So, you made it here okay?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,515
I was thinking --
all that time in England,

31
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:21,531
you might forget which side
of the road to drive on.

32
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:22,892
Hey, don't steal my material.

33
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:23,764
What do you mean,
your material?

34
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,705
I just made that joke.

35
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,517
The drive-on-the-other-side-
of-the-road thing? That's my joke.

36
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:28,068
If you just made it,
you ripped me off.

37
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:29,777
- I ripped you off?
- Guys.

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,844
That's like saying Lenny
Bruce rips off Carrot Top

39
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,880
or Woody Allen gets his material
from what's his name --

40
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:36,022
the guy with the watermelons.

41
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,024
I did not rip you off --
no way, no how, sister.

42
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:41,189
I made that joke this morning at
breakfast. We were sitting there.

43
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:42,272
- We were drinking coffee.
- Guys...

44
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:44,353
not that that's not
a hilarious joke,

45
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,897
but the guy at the car
park made the same one.

46
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:48,881
Hey, G.G., would you want
to take this inside for me?

47
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:50,310
Come on, Geege.

48
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,071
- Ohh!
- What?

49
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:54,570
You took the
Christmas lights down.

50
00:01:54,584 --> 00:01:55,910
I didn't take them down.
I haven't put them up yet.

51
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:57,214
I saved Christmas for you.

52
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,604
Before you left, we said we were
gonna wait and do Christmas together.

53
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,110
Okay, yeah, but --

54
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,365
What are those?

55
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:03,745
What are what?

56
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:05,464
Are those a Christmas
present from Logan?

57
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:07,210
No, I mean -- well, yeah,

58
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:09,787
but it's more like a late
birthday/new year's present.

59
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:10,737
Stop sniffing me.

60
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,042
I smell Christmas cookies.

61
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:14,343
There's no way you can smell
cookies from six days ago.

62
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:15,513
So there were
Christmas cookies.

63
00:02:15,546 --> 00:02:16,760
There may have been
a little Christmas.

64
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:17,853
Unbelievable!

65
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:20,250
London, as a city,
is very Christmas-obsessed, okay?

66
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:22,255
I couldn't help what
was going on around me.

67
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:23,637
But inside, I assure you,

68
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,748
I was devoid of the Christmas spirit --
a complete scrooge.

69
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:27,350
I didn't let any
Christmas happen.

70
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:29,852
I grinched it up so hard,
I didn't let it snow.

71
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,167
What? It hasn't snowed yet?

72
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:33,513
Thanks to me thinking of you and
our agreement, our pledge, our oath.

73
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:34,541
You stopped the snow?

74
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,556
Yes, sheer force of will.

75
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:39,172
We said we would have no Christmas,
so I had no Christmas.

76
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:40,612
You must have had
a little Christmas.

77
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:41,417
None.

78
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,730
- No presents?
- No presents.

79
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:43,641
- No tree?
- No tree.

80
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:45,493
- No eggnog?
- No egg, no nog.

81
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:47,794
I sat in the dark with the
lights off and ate gruel.

82
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:50,719
Okay, mom, I hereby apologize

83
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:53,039
for any accidental Christmas
celebrating I may have done.

84
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:54,603
I'm now ready to celebrate
Christmas for real.

85
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:55,602
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

86
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:56,629
Okay!

87
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,757
So, you stopped the snow?

88
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,187
Yeah. I did an anti-snow dance.

89
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,889
It was humiliating and arduous,
but I had made a promise to my daughter.

90
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:05,095
- Humiliating?
- Two words -- coconut bra.

91
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,637
- Where am I taking this?
- Living room.

92
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,555
- I love our trees!
- Me too!

93
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,291
- You don't think our trees are...
- What?

94
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:05,381
- Maybe a little homely?
- Homely?!

95
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:06,723
- I'm just saying.
- What?

96
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:07,509
What are you saying?

97
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:10,051
That our trees are not classically
good-looking. If you were to look up "tree"

98
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,103
in the dictionary,
you would not find one of these fellas.

99
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:13,609
Why would you look up
"tree" in the dictionary?

100
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,278
So we don't have classically
good-looking trees.

101
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,381
You don't know what a tree is?

102
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,147
- Come on, look at that tree.
- I'm looking.

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,596
- That tree has character.
- It does.

104
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,867
That tree has earned
character by persevering

105
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:25,443
through freezing winters
and forest fires and floods.

106
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,327
This tree's a fighter.

107
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,800
Woodpeckers. Maniacal woodpeckers
just pecking at its trunk.

108
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:29,568
Survivor.

109
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,833
Peck, peck, peck,
day in and day out.

110
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,358
That tree's a champion.

111
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,183
It smells so good in
here with all our trees.

112
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:36,003
It's like a dozen
car air fresheners.

113
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:38,823
Just imagine how good it's gonna be
once all of our trees are in here.

114
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:39,887
This is crazy!

115
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,863
- Seven trees.
- Which was crazy.

116
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:43,252
What? Buck a tree.

117
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:45,784
Dad, we have to have at least
one tree in the kitchen.

118
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,043
Yeah, dad.

119
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:49,230
I'm in a forest of crazy.

120
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,407
- Buck a tree.
- Genius.

121
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,089
So genius. We better be careful,
or word will get out

122
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:56,153
and everyone will start celebrating
Christmas after Christmas,

123
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,993
which will really drive up the
post-Christmas Christmas-tree prices.

124
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,843
Then we'll have to keep
celebrating later and later.

125
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:03,731
Yeah, before we know it,
we'll be having figgy pudding in july.

126
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,745
Look! G.G.!

127
00:05:05,864 --> 00:05:08,111
You know who made this? Rory.

128
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:10,133
Rory made this when she
was right about your age.

129
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:11,314
That's nice.

130
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,367
Someone's not impressed.

131
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:14,287
She doesn't understand
abstract art.

132
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:15,113
Philistine.

133
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:18,344
Hey, look at this.
Here's Santa's costume.

134
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,601
Wow. That's seen better days.

135
00:05:19,614 --> 00:05:21,557
Why do you have
Santa's clothes?

136
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,638
Because... I...
used to do Santa's dry cleaning.

137
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,075
- You did?
- Yeah.

138
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:27,599
- Wow.
- I know.

139
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:29,373
Okay, everybody can relax.

140
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,790
There's now a Christmas
tree in the kitchen.

141
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:32,604
Thank you.

142
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,648
Oh! My antlers!
I love my antlers!

143
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:35,993
Oh, neat!

144
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:37,755
Let me try!

145
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,450
On Vixen! On Blinxen !

146
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,944
Kid took my antlers. She took my
antlers and she galloped away.

147
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,747
All right,
now tell me more about London.

148
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,463
Did everything work out
with Logan after the whole

149
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,132
Marty/Lucy/dinner debacle?

150
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,014
Well, I was pretty
angry for a while,

151
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:52,536
especially after he blurted out
all that stuff the way he did,

152
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,902
but he apologized a lot

153
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,744
and even admitted that he was a
little jealous, so I forgave him.

154
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:58,807
Well, that's good.

155
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:01,128
Yeah. Well, plus I realized
a lot of it was my fault.

156
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:02,354
You know, I was Lucy's friend.

157
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,486
I should have been straight
with her about knowing Marty.

158
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,350
I just can't believe I got suckered
into that whole thing for so long.

159
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:09,933
I don't blame her
for hating me.

160
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:11,504
So have you talked to her now?

161
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:12,723
I've left messages.

162
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:13,788
Oh, hon.

163
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:15,694
Wow! Look at all this!

164
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:17,730
Yeah, we have a lot
of Christmas stuff.

165
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:20,241
Cool. Mistletoe.

166
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,277
Where are you going with that?

167
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,353
I'm gonna hang it
up in the doorway.

168
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:23,694
Oh, that's not where it goes.

169
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,452
Where does it go?

170
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:26,838
We tape it to one of the blades
of the ceiling fan upstairs.

171
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,614
That way,
the kissing is more like a sport.

172
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:29,506
One of our traditions.

173
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,580
That's a tradition?

174
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,145
Our traditions are
very important to us.

175
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,052
What other traditions
am I in for?

176
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,968
On Christmas morning, we put red
and green M&M's in our cereal.

177
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:37,905
Down with that.

178
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:39,833
We string up our
stockings on the banister.

179
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:43,133
Yes, we used to string them up on the
traditional place of the fireplace,

180
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:46,155
but then there was that fire incident,
and they nearly burned to bits.

181
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,677
So now we put them on little
nails on the banister.

182
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:51,641
Oh, we always go to Weston's for a
cup of holiday candy-cane coffee,

183
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:52,915
which is so delicious.

184
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:55,170
Delicious. And we bake cookies.

185
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:56,205
You bake?

186
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:58,392
Well, we put on some Christmas music,
drink eggnog,

187
00:06:58,407 --> 00:07:00,742
and pretend to bake the cookies
we actually bought from Weston's.

188
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,565
We do, however,
make our own frosting.

189
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:05,097
We use a handheld electric
mixer from the dark ages

190
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,723
so that Rory can continue the
tradition of licking the beaters.

191
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:09,871
Yes, a skill which I have
perfected over the years.

192
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,902
And then on Christmas Eve, we leave
the cookies out for Santa's reindeer.

193
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,004
Santa prefers gum.

194
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,951
Well, I am very excited
about these traditions,

195
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:18,829
but, you know, because it's our
first Christmas together as a family,

196
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:21,188
I thought maybe it was time
to start some new traditions.

197
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:22,360
Like what?

198
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,941
Well, for starters...

199
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:26,271
I got us these.

200
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:27,114
Wow.

201
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,919
Oh, they're so big and flashy.

202
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,108
I got one for each of us.

203
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:32,785
But we have stockings already.

204
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:35,381
I mean,
they're a little singed from the fire,

205
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:36,668
but they're still usable.

206
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,565
But not stockings like these.

207
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:39,804
That's true.

208
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,943
All right, this will be a new tradition.
I'm gonna hang them up.

209
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:44,108
You know what else we should do?
We should go caroling.

210
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:45,441
- No.
- Are you kidding?

211
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:46,765
Come on, it'll be fun.

212
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,680
It wouldn't be fun for
strangers to hear us sing.

213
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:51,495
- It'd be cruel, that's what it would be.
- And embarrassing.

214
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,402
Guys, carols are beautiful.

215
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:14,166
Yes, sir. Thank you.

216
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:16,631
Oh. You.

217
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:18,291
I thought we were
done with you.

218
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:20,294
Hi, Michel. Is Lorelai here?

219
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,896
Hey. Can you tell
Lorelai that...

220
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:27,447
someone is here to see her?

221
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,045
Well, this is awfully awkward.

222
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,702
We should make some
sort of conversation.

223
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,140
I see your sense of
style has not changed.

224
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:42,859
Nope.

225
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:47,330
I've often wondered, does someone in
your family own a flannel company?

226
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:48,673
Uh, no.

227
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:52,729
You know what?
I cannot do this.

228
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:55,924
Let us just stand here and let
the awkwardness wash over us.

229
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:57,177
Fine by me.

230
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,770
- Hi.
- Ahh, here she is.

231
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:04,843
It's been a delight
chatting with you.

232
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:07,375
- I'm sorry to just barge in like this.
- That's okay.

233
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:08,773
Can we talk somewhere?

234
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:10,213
Um, sure.

235
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:17,413
Anna wants to move to
New Mexico with April.

236
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:18,372
New Mexico?

237
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:22,211
Anna's mother just had major surgery,
and she's not doing so well.

238
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:24,299
And Anna wants to be near her,
which I get.

239
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,749
It's just I'd like to see April
on some weekends and vacations.

240
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:30,399
- Of course.
- But Anna says no.

241
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:33,909
In fact, right now,
she's not letting me see April at all,

242
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:36,519
so I have to fight for custody,

243
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,361
and I'm going to court.

244
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,432
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's the whole thing.

245
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:43,242
I got to get a lawyer and wear a tie.
It's not a whole lot of fun.

246
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:44,631
It's good you're
doing it, though.

247
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:48,096
Well, I can't not.
You know, I mean, I can't not do it.

248
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,023
Right.

249
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:53,551
So, anyway, um,
the court date is coming up.

250
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,340
And I need a
character reference.

251
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:59,536
And Liz wrote one, but my lawyer
read it, and he said it was sweet,

252
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:02,853
but it was filled with all
these weird childhood anecdotes

253
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,797
that I probably don't want to share
with anyone, much less a court of law.

254
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,471
And I need another one,
and I just don't know who to go to.

255
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:12,185
And I know it's an
awful lot to ask.

256
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:14,562
And if it's weird or whatever,
I mean, I totally understand.

257
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:15,534
Yes.

258
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:17,481
But if you could, uh...

259
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:19,081
Yes, I'll do it.

260
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:20,452
Yeah?

261
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:24,498
Okay. All right, well,
this is my lawyer's address,

262
00:10:24,512 --> 00:10:27,300
and you can just mail the
letter directly to him.

263
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:28,155
- Okay.
- Yeah.

264
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,550
And, look, if you don't mind, if you
could do it as soon as possible...

265
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:33,324
The court date's right
around the corner.

266
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,048
- Definitely.
- Thanks. Thank you.

267
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:37,331
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

268
00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:40,667
Okay, well... I'll just...

269
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,761
- Thanks.
- Sure. I'll get right on it.

270
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,956
- I send it to here. Okay.
- All right.

271
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,048
Thanks.

272
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:47,545
Okay.

273
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:02,143
No, that should do it. Thanks.

274
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:03,724
- Ugh!
- It's hard, huh?

275
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:06,044
Yeah, the pressure is a lot,
you know?

276
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:07,013
Yeah, of course.

277
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,402
I mean, I just keep thinking that
whatever I write might help save

278
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:11,818
Luke's relationship with his kid,
which is huge and important,

279
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,070
so the pressure's really getting to me
-- that and a lack of sufficient caffeine.

280
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,621
Of course. Totally.
Plus, it's Luke,

281
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,991
and after all you've been through,
it's got to be hard.

282
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:21,055
Well, yeah.

283
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,951
You're having to dig up
all those feelings for him.

284
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:26,462
That can't be fun.
You must be feeling overwhelmed.

285
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,100
I don't think it's about
digging up my feelings for Luke.

286
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:29,693
Okay.

287
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,662
I think it's really about
writing an amazing letter.

288
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:33,232
I mean, the stakes
are really high for him,

289
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:37,011
and I want it to be something
amazing and powerful,

290
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:39,160
you know,
like Gettysburg address powerful

291
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:41,137
or "I have a dream" powerful.

292
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:43,583
So, I'm thinking I'll look
a couple of those up online

293
00:11:43,598 --> 00:11:46,478
and just pop the name "Luke"
in there and be done with it.

294
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:47,946
Sure. I don't think
anyone will notice.

295
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:49,059
All right, back to work.

296
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:50,295
Good luck.

297
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:26,718
Is it twins?
It's got to be twins.

298
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,269
- Is what twins?
- Are you...

299
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:29,959
Pregnant? You
think I'm pregnant?

300
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:32,758
Oh yeah, because it's not acceptable in
this society to be a plus-sized woman

301
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,418
who happens to carry
her weight in her belly.

302
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,279
So you're not -- oh, gee.

303
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:39,077
Well, I need new glasses.
I'm sorry.

304
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,371
Of course I'm pregnant.
Turkey with swiss.

305
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,358
Hey! Hey!
What's up with this tip?

306
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:47,490
Oh, I'm... sorry.

307
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,840
This is 50%.
I don't need your pity tips.

308
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:52,496
Okay, I'm pregnant,
not homeless.

309
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,709
April! Hey!

310
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,120
Wow. What are you doing?

311
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,879
Well, I biked over because --
oh, my gosh. Lane is gigantic.

312
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:01,243
I wouldn't mention
that to Lane.

313
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:04,119
Hey, did you know the gestation
period for an elephant is 22 months?

314
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:06,381
I wouldn't mention that to Lane, either.
So what do you doing here?

315
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,714
Does your mother
know you're here?

316
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,106
She doesn't have a clue.

317
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,397
You see, I told her I was
gonna spend the whole day

318
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:14,190
at the Boston museum of science
with my friend Melissa and her dad.

319
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:17,240
And it's perfect because mom confirmed
things with Melissa's dad two days ago.

320
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:20,472
But, then yesterday, I told
Melissa's dad that I couldn't come

321
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:22,074
because I had gotten the curse,

322
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:25,447
which is perfect, 'cause you know how
awkward men get about menstruation.

323
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:28,392
Yeah, look, it's really great to
see you, but this isn't gonna work.

324
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,012
There's no way mom will
ever figure it out.

325
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:32,555
I even read all about cotton-topped
tamarin monkeys they have there

326
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,912
and the Van de Graaff generator, so I'll
have plenty to tell her when I get back.

327
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:37,390
I'm gonna have to
take you home.

328
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:38,595
- No!
- I'm sorry.

329
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:40,743
Dad, no. Please, no.
I've missed you so much.

330
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:42,001
I missed you, too.

331
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:43,553
I haven't seen you
in ages and ages.

332
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:46,509
Plus, if you take me home now,
mom will know that I lied,

333
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,483
and I'll get into
so much trouble.

334
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:50,422
- Please?
- I don't know.

335
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:52,120
Here. This is for you.

336
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:54,057
Merry belated Christmas.
Sorry it looks like this.

337
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,906
I couldn't exactly wrap
it in wrapping paper

338
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:57,893
without arousing
maternal suspicions,

339
00:13:57,906 --> 00:13:59,093
if you know what I mean.

340
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,624
Thanks. I actually got
you something, too.

341
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,507
You did?

342
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,655
Yeah.

343
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,618
So, are you hungry or what?

344
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:07,734
Tuna-fish sandwiches?

345
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:09,124
That's what I was
thinking, too.

346
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:11,260
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

347
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,456
Be very careful
with your needle.

348
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,242
I know.

349
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:17,264
Okay, because it's really,
really pointy.

350
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,254
I know.

351
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:19,961
Okay, so what guidelines
did he give you?

352
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,079
None. No guidelines.
No guidelines whatsoever.

353
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:23,568
I'm supposed to write
a character reference,

354
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,609
so I thought I'd
reference his character.

355
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:26,721
Sounds like you're
on the right track.

356
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:28,917
No, I'm not,
because it turns out I can't write.

357
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,779
- Oh, sure, you can.
- No, I can't.

358
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:34,200
I stare at the blank page,
and I just keep staring and staring.

359
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:36,361
And eventually I have to get
up and lubricate my eyeballs.

360
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:38,596
Otherwise, they would fall
out of my head, like raisins.

361
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,954
Well, are you using a pen?
You can't just stare at the paper.

362
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,908
You have to have a writing
implement of some kind.

363
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:43,928
Look.

364
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,035
- Very pretty, honey.
- What a good job.

365
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,348
You know what I really like?
Your cranberry-to-popcorn ratio.

366
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,860
Rory's more of a one-to-one kind of gal,
but I'm like you.

367
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,171
I like a lot of cranberry,
little popcorn for flair.

368
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,629
- Yours is pretty, too.
- Thank you.

369
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,354
I have a writing implement.
The problem is

370
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:58,502
that everything I write
sounds so schmucky.

371
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,594
I'm sure that's not true.
We're running low on cranberries.

372
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,690
"Luke Danes is a highly regarded
member of this community.

373
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:08,019
Not an ill word can be
spoken of Mr. Danes."

374
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,315
It's like I'm some documentary
narrator from the history channel.

375
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,668
And you know what phrase
I keep using? "Stand-up."

376
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,919
"Luke Danes is a stand-up guy.

377
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,547
He's an upstanding
member of Stars Hollow,

378
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:20,304
a real stand-up citizen."

379
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,906
People are gonna think he's
turned into a comedian.

380
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:23,383
Sounds like you're
overthinking this.

381
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:24,868
Maybe if you just
put pen to paper.

382
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:27,926
I tried that. I thought, "I'll just
sit down and write whatever comes --

383
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,595
no judgment, no inner critic."

384
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,389
- Was that a bad idea.
- Really? Why?

385
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:35,120
Because my brain is a wild
jungle full of scary gibberish.

386
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:36,385
"I'm writing a letter.
I can't write a letter.

387
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,373
Why can't I write a letter?
I'm wearing a green dress.

388
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,883
I wish I was wearing my blue dress.
My blue dress is at the cleaners.

389
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:44,306
'The germans wore gray. You wore blue.'
'Casablanca' is such a good movie.

390
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:45,843
'Casablanca.' The
white house. Bush.

391
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:48,260
Why don't I drive a hybrid car?
I should drive a hybrid car.

392
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:51,019
I should really take my bicycle to work.
Bicycle. Unicycle. Unitard.

393
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,899
Hockey puck. Rattlesnake.
Monkey, monkey, underpants."

394
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,153
"Hockey puck, rattlesnake,
monkey, monkey, underpants"?

395
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,809
Exactly. That's
what I'm saying.

396
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,280
It's a big bag of
weird in there.

397
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,351
So, I think I need inspiration.

398
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:03,813
I need a muse.
Perhaps I need "the muse."

399
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:06,000
Maybe it would help if Sharon
Stone would appear to me

400
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:08,493
in an alarming caftan and coo
inspirational words in my ear.

401
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,385
Just write what you feel.
That's all writing is.

402
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,975
Hey, do you think there
might be some reason

403
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,193
why you're having
trouble with this?

404
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:15,821
I would imagine that writing
about Luke wouldn't be easy.

405
00:16:15,835 --> 00:16:17,711
- I know. You should write it.
- What? No.

406
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,144
Yes. You are a wonderful writer.
Everything you write is so good.

407
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:23,484
Your grocery lists are
like shimmering haikus.

408
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,123
You write a pretty mean
grocery list yourself.

409
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:27,608
And it doesn't have to shimmer.
It just has to be authentic and real.

410
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:28,769
Oh! You know what I'm gonna do?

411
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:29,737
Write my thing for me.

412
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,009
No, I'm going to
write a letter to Lucy

413
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,619
explaining how sorry I am.
That way, she doesn't have to see me,

414
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:36,440
and she can just read it
and she'll still know.

415
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:39,510
That's great. And after you do that,
you can write my letter for me.

416
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,696
No. This is something you
have to write for yourself.

417
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,865
- What letter?
- Uh... to Santa.

418
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,794
Wow.

419
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,089
You know what my problem is?

420
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:48,581
It's the whole
writing-by-hand thing.

421
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:52,131
You know? I think what would help is if
I got my old electric typewriter out.

422
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,250
The soothing sound of
that irritating buzzing,

423
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,036
- that's what would help me.
- I'm home!

424
00:16:56,048 --> 00:17:00,159
So, cranberries really stay on the
string, and popcorn falls right off.

425
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:01,577
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, everybody.

426
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:02,669
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, dad.

427
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:03,995
- Hey.
- Hey.

428
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:06,611
Wow. Look at those.

429
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,936
They're for the trees.

430
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,935
So, what do you
have in the bag?

431
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,234
No snooping.
This is Santa's secret stuff.

432
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:13,375
- Lorelai knows Santa.
- Oh, yeah?

433
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,301
She does Santa's dry cleaning.

434
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:18,456
Well, Lorelai is a
remarkable woman.

435
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,940
- The yellow squash?
- Yes, they're a delicacy.

436
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,542
We're going to steam them
along with the broccoli.

437
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:40,506
Is that adult broccoli?
Can you do that with baby squash?

438
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,243
Yes, it's very
high in oxidants.

439
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:43,460
- Welcome home, babe.
- Welcome home, Lane.

440
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,763
So we went to the nature mart,
and guess what we got you.

441
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:48,411
Turnip greens -- turns out they
got a sick amount of folic acid.

442
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:51,124
What else did we get?
Squash, zucchini, tofu.

443
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,765
Special calcium fortified tofu.

444
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,549
And the calcium's real important
because you're not eating

445
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,483
some of your previous calcium sources,
like soft cheese.

446
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:58,923
You're not eating soft cheese,
are you?

447
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:01,317
No. I'm not having
any soft cheese.

448
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,006
- And no sushi?
- And no duck.

449
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,463
We don't want the babies
to have webbed feet.

450
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:07,484
So the duck sushi I had for lunch
was probably a mistake, huh?

451
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:09,386
I'm kidding, mama.

452
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:10,949
I am beat.

453
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:13,461
Today at work,
it was absolutely ridiculous.

454
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:16,442
Every other customer was "baby" crazy!
I'm gonna tell Luke tomorrow.

455
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,120
- You should put your feet up.
- I'm fine.

456
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:19,962
- How are your ankles?
- They're fine.

457
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:22,168
You know what I was reading about?
Compression pantyhose.

458
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:24,546
A lot of pregnant women wear
them to help with circulation.

459
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,106
How are your bladder? Are the babies
putting a lot of pressure on your bladder?

460
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:28,143
What? I don't know.

461
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:30,024
How many times did
you urinate today?

462
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:32,383
Oh, my god, Zach!
I am so not answering that question!

463
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:34,473
Here are some new prenatal
vitamins we bought you.

464
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,728
I'm going to put them
on your bedside table.

465
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,460
You have to take two every
morning the moment you wake up.

466
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:41,175
Maybe I need to
make you a chart.

467
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:42,779
I don't need a chart.

468
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:45,617
I happen to know that you forgot
to take your calcium tablets

469
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:46,881
for two mornings.

470
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:48,311
That is not right, Lane.

471
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,529
Mama, you're counting my pills?

472
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:51,018
Yes, of course.

473
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,118
I'm serious about the whole
compression-pantyhose thing.

474
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,806
I could totally
pick you up a pair.

475
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:05,134
I mean, do I relish the prospect of being
seen skulking around the pantyhose aisle?

476
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:07,474
No. But I'm sure you
don't want varicose veins.

477
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:10,120
- I don't want pantyhose!
- Oh. Okay.

478
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:13,016
I have decided I will make a chart.
I need a piece of paper,

479
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:14,771
a ruler,
and some magic markers.

480
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:16,631
I'm serious, mama.
I don't need --

481
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:19,595
- What is that?
- Oh, it's the crib we ordered.

482
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:21,533
Isn't it cool?
It'll be big enough for both of them.

483
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:22,692
Where are my drums?

484
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:24,775
They're good, they're safe.
We put them in the closet.

485
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,356
The closet?
You put my drum kit in the closet?

486
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:31,249
Yeah, we needed the space, and, Lane,
we haven't had band practice for months.

487
00:19:36,998 --> 00:19:38,757
We need to have band practice!

488
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:40,358
Sure. And we will.

489
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:40,972
Now.

490
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:43,305
Well, if you want,
we can call Gil and Brian,

491
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,500
but I mean, can you even play?

492
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:47,888
What do you mean, can I play?

493
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:50,026
I mean, in your condition.

494
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,417
I can play.

495
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,635
Okay.

496
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,027
Cool.

497
00:19:58,691 --> 00:20:01,888
I melted three entire candy canes into
this not-very-large cup of coffee,

498
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:03,921
- and still I can barely taste it.
- I know.

499
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,926
It's just the vaguest
whisper of peppermint.

500
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:06,752
Peppermint.

501
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:09,925
I swear, I could get the same
effect if I put vaporub on my chest

502
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,095
and drank coffee
at the same time.

503
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:11,855
Peppermint.

504
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:15,479
I mean, how arbitrary is it to decide
to stop serving candy-cane coffee

505
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:17,176
the day after Christmas?

506
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:19,508
Christmas spirit is not
something that can be turned off

507
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:21,617
like a faucet on december 26th.

508
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,661
Yeah, it stinks.

509
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:25,837
On the plus side, any chest congestion
I had is now totally cleared up.

510
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:26,595
Well, that's good.

511
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:28,053
Well, let's
go Christmas-shopping.

512
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:30,058
- Write your letter.
- I can't. I need a treat.

513
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,596
This was your treat. Coming to Weston's
was supposed to buck up your spirits.

514
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,798
and inspire your writing.

515
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:36,637
No, candy-cane coffee was
supposed to be my treat.

516
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:38,276
This coffee is no treat.

517
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,644
Let's face it --
this is un-candy-cane-coffee coffee,

518
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,190
and it's totally
un-bucking up my spirits.

519
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,474
So it's decided --
let's go shopping.

520
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:44,643
Write.

521
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:46,457
Rory, I can't.

522
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:48,557
Ooh. I have an idea. Excuse me.

523
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,358
Hi. Merry Christmas.

524
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,375
Christmas is over.

525
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:52,739
Okay. Sue -- pretty name.

526
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,304
I have a hunch that there's some of
the secret candy-cane-coffee mix

527
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,899
just sitting in the back there,

528
00:20:57,912 --> 00:20:59,913
and I wonder if I could
make it worth your while

529
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,962
if you and I could come to
some sort of arrangement.

530
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:05,464
Like I said before, we stop selling
candy-cane coffee when Christmas is over.

531
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,498
Right. I'm not talking
about selling it.

532
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,587
I'm talking about maybe if you
misplaced a canister or two.

533
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:13,020
- Misplaced?
- Misplaced.

534
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:14,605
- Honey.
- Yes?

535
00:21:14,618 --> 00:21:16,725
- Christmas is over.
- Okay.

536
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,609
- Are we gonna talk about this?
- About what?

537
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,882
- Why are you lying to dad?
- I'm not lying.

538
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:25,238
He walked into the kitchen earlier,
and you all of a sudden

539
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:27,962
started prattling on about
popcorn and cranberries.

540
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:31,136
I wasn't prattling.
Come on, let's blow this popsicle stand.

541
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,685
But you're not telling him about this
character-reference thing, are you?

542
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,449
- I haven't yet.
- And you're not planning to.

543
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:40,755
You're intentionally not telling him.
That's kind of a lie of omission.

544
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,252
A Lie of Omission ? Isn't that an
Ashley Judd/Morgan Freeman movie?

545
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:46,014
Look mom, if there's anything to be
learned from this whole thing with Lucy,

546
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:48,789
It's an okay policy.

547
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:50,410
But how do you expect to have
any kind of relationship

548
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:51,750
if you're not honest with him?

549
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:54,303
Honey, look,
I have been around a long time, okay?

550
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:56,000
I wore leggings the last
time they were trendy.

551
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:58,492
I knew Tom Hanks when he was a bosom
buddy. I have lived, and I have learned.

552
00:21:58,527 --> 00:21:59,099
I know.

553
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:02,060
And I understand that you value honesty,
and I applaud that value.

554
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:04,745
But sometimes the truth is
a little more complicated.

555
00:22:04,762 --> 00:22:05,984
More complicated how?

556
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:08,429
More complicated.
We don't have to talk about this.

557
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:11,164
I know, but I want you to
tell me what's going on.

558
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:14,223
Things with dad are great.
They're better than great.

559
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:15,883
It's just that...

560
00:22:15,896 --> 00:22:16,698
What?

561
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,018
He's been a bit on
edge about Luke.

562
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,097
You know, I ran into Luke
outside Doose's the other day,

563
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,668
and dad saw me
holding Liz's baby.

564
00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:25,808
And it just wasn't great.
It wasn't great timing.

565
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:30,668
And this whole mom having the
not-a-wedding-party thing caused tension,

566
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:31,888
and we argued.

567
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,132
So I just want to be
sensitive and not worry him

568
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,847
about something he doesn't
need to worry about.

569
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:37,143
Well, that makes sense.

570
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:40,011
But everything is
gonna be fine.

571
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,556
Better than fine --
it's gonna be great.

572
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:42,560
Okay.

573
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,400
Well, you know, mom,
I've been around for a while, too.

574
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,854
I remember Tom Hanks from his
"Joe versus the volcano" days.

575
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:48,989
Yeah, you were like 5.

576
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:50,840
Yeah, but the point is,
I'm not a kid anymore.

577
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:53,362
You don't have to create this
whole Christmas illusion

578
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,836
where everything in the
world is magical and fine.

579
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:57,303
It's okay if it's not.

580
00:22:57,318 --> 00:22:59,065
You still believe in Santa,
though, right?

581
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:01,234
Your best dry-cleaning client?
Of course.

582
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:06,664
A little to the right. Okay. Too far.
A little to the left. There.

583
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:07,659
- How's that?
- Good.

584
00:23:07,675 --> 00:23:08,859
It really livens
up your apartment.

585
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:11,381
It's a very lively mask.
Thanks again, April.

586
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:12,800
I love it. I really do.

587
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:14,278
It's based on my real face.

588
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,112
Oh, yeah?

589
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:16,858
Not the outside,
but the inside.

590
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:19,560
I made it in art class, and I had
to lie still with straws up my nose

591
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,297
while a partner put
plaster strips on my face.

592
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:23,676
- Straws on your nose, huh?
- I suffer for my art.

593
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,475
Anyway, this kid Evan,
he got Liz Alderman as a partner,

594
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:29,735
who's a total wild child. And she laid
the plaster strips all willy-nilly

595
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,856
and ended up pulling
off half his eyebrows.

596
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:33,237
Oh, that's not good.

597
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:35,374
Actually, Liz Alderman's
on my swim team now.

598
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:36,307
Oh yeah?

599
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,703
She's got these really huge feet,
which coach Bennett finds promising.

600
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:40,544
- Like built-in flippers.
- Exactly.

601
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:43,404
Hopefully they kick in -- no pun intended
-- before our big swim meet in may.

602
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,485
- May, huh?
- May 15th.

603
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:48,130
10 different clubs are sending teams.
It's gonna be amazing.

604
00:23:48,144 --> 00:23:50,635
I hear they have really great
swim teams in New Mexico.

605
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:54,059
Yeah, right.
New Mexico is a barren, dusty desert,

606
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:56,214
and they probably don't
even have water to swim in.

607
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:58,929
In hot climates,
they actually have more swimming pools.

608
00:23:58,943 --> 00:24:01,164
I bet you a lot of kids there
will be really into swimming.

609
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:02,573
Then they're probably
too good for me.

610
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,321
I mean, the only reason I
get to do so many events

611
00:24:04,354 --> 00:24:06,323
is 'cause everyone on my
team stinks worse than I do.

612
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:07,820
- April!
- It's true.

613
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,164
Go on.

614
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:12,298
All right, go ahead and open
up your Christmas present.

615
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:15,453
Are you trying to bribe me out of a bad
mood with the offer of material goods?

616
00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:17,123
'Cause I'm amenable to that.

617
00:24:21,702 --> 00:24:24,747
Wow! A rock polisher!

618
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,540
- Thanks so much.
- You like it?

619
00:24:26,555 --> 00:24:29,063
- It's the perfect present.
- You hinted at it pretty hard,

620
00:24:29,077 --> 00:24:30,473
so I figured it might
be the right thing.

621
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:32,161
It is. It is.

622
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:36,207
But, dad, I kind of already got
a rock polisher from grandma.

623
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:38,316
Oh. Well,
then it's not the perfect present.

624
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:39,458
No, it is. It is.

625
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:41,705
This one looks more powerful
than the one I already have.

626
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:43,755
Plus, I mean,
who couldn't use two rock polishers?

627
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:44,857
- Yeah?
- Sure.

628
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:46,343
You should see my rock
collection right now.

629
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:49,043
It's insane. I've practically
got a quarry in my bedroom --

630
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:53,019
granite, of course, but also feldspar,
quartz, mica, limestone.

631
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,351
- Cool.
- I know.

632
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,307
I've been biking over to Beacon Falls and
going rock-hunting around Naugatuck River.

633
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,457
It's amazing.

634
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:00,873
The other day, I found an arrowhead
in almost perfect condition.

635
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:03,635
It's so sharp, I think I'd get in
trouble if I brought it to school.

636
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,080
You know, if you're interested
in arrowheads, New Mexico has

637
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:07,827
- some incredible places --
- Dad.

638
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:09,773
Okay. Okay.

639
00:25:10,835 --> 00:25:12,308
Let's open this thing.

640
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,720
Hey! I'm done with the lights.

641
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:17,793
Do you want to see them now,
or you want to wait till after dark?

642
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,016
Uh, I will wait --
to get the full effect.

643
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:22,261
What you got there?

644
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:25,166
Uh, nothing.
Just some of Santa's secret stuff.

645
00:25:25,183 --> 00:25:26,671
Oh, yeah? What did you get me?

646
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:28,736
- A Maserati.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

647
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,997
It's amazing how a Maserati can
fit behind the bed like that.

648
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,819
I haven't put it together yet,
which reminds me --

649
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:34,228
do you have any masking
tape I can borrow?

650
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:36,290
You're gonna assemble the
Maserati with masking tape?

651
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:38,996
Don't ask questions! Get out of here.
It's Santa's workshop!

652
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:43,147
Rory!

653
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:45,047
We have to go shopping,

654
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:46,955
get your dad a Maserati!

655
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:52,668
So of course I spun the record
for like a week straight,

656
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,845
because who wouldn't want to listen
to art brut for a week straight?

657
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,178
Pass me your lyrics.

658
00:25:56,193 --> 00:25:58,193
Yeah. Here they are.

659
00:25:58,234 --> 00:26:01,426
As far as I'm concerned, "formed a
band" could be the new national anthem.

660
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:04,808
I swear I could literally stand
and cover my heart if asked.

661
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:06,902
Brian?

662
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,367
Brian?

663
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,150
Whoa!

664
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:12,923
What's going on here, babe?
Everything okay?

665
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:14,493
You got to watch
the loud noises.

666
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:17,526
Loud noises?
We're about to play rock music, Zach.

667
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:20,135
Oh, check out the mandolin.

668
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,755
Yeah, right.
She's a beaut, huh?

669
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:23,857
Yeah. Cool.
What kind of stuff you been working on?

670
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,379
Mostly I've just
been messing around.

671
00:26:25,394 --> 00:26:27,664
I wrote one song that was kind
of White Stripes' "Little Ghost"

672
00:26:27,697 --> 00:26:30,091
meets The Decemberists
meets Gulag Orkestar

673
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:31,730
meets, like,
"Losing my religion"

674
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:33,736
meets Jethro Burns on
that Steve Goodman album

675
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:35,654
meets "Battle of
Evermore" meets the Smiths

676
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,251
meets... some other stuff.

677
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:40,678
- That's lot of meeting.
- Exactly.

678
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:43,997
Whoa. Okay, this is eerie.

679
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,267
You see the way I'm
holding my mandolin.

680
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:48,091
It's exactly one of the
baby holds I've learned.

681
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:50,977
See how I have it in the crook of
my arm with its head supported?

682
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,291
That's how you're
supposed to hold a baby?

683
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:54,698
One of the ways.
Man, Lane, I wish your mom was here.

684
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,030
This is so totally
"rock-a-bye, baby."

685
00:26:57,045 --> 00:26:57,971
Fascinating.

686
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:00,895
So wait, there are different
ways to officially hold a baby?

687
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,281
Yeah, sure --
you got your "hello, world,"

688
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:05,038
where you put the baby's
back to your stomach

689
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:06,937
and put your hand
under here for support.

690
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:08,239
You got your belly hold,

691
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:11,433
where you put the baby's chest
down along one of your forearms.

692
00:27:11,449 --> 00:27:13,333
This is really great
for gassy babies.

693
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:15,501
Then you got your fruit basket,
which is --

694
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:16,747
Finally.

695
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:22,597
Hey, hey, hey! How we doing?

696
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:23,834
Long time no see.

697
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,270
- Gil, how's it hangin'?
- It's hangin' great, my friend.

698
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:30,163
So, check it out. This is the
youngest of my brood -- Macon.

699
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:32,188
Macon, this is the band.

700
00:27:32,203 --> 00:27:33,097
What up?

701
00:27:33,114 --> 00:27:35,955
The sitter flaked,
and I got Macon the bacon under my wing.

702
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:36,610
That's cool.

703
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:38,557
Sorry for the short notice,
but I figured you guys would be

704
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:42,191
a little more understanding being
that you're in the family way.

705
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:44,300
Speaking of which...

706
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:45,942
Whoa! Check you out, Lane.

707
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:48,915
You are some kind of
serious fertility goddess.

708
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:49,787
Thanks.

709
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,561
Zach, nice work, man.

710
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:54,774
So, I thought we should warm up by
practicing some of our old songs.

711
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:57,505
And then maybe Zach could show us what
he's been doing with the mandolin.

712
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:58,895
The mandolin.

713
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:01,851
Right on.

714
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:04,343
Oh, man!
You got the Alcmere 3000!

715
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,366
- The what?
- The breast pump.

716
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,361
I'm psyched you guys picked this one.
It's really gentle.

717
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:11,299
I mean,
my wife's got sensitive nipples.

718
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:13,217
This one didn't
bum her out at all.

719
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:15,902
- You use that to pump...
- Milk. Sure.

720
00:28:15,914 --> 00:28:18,097
That's if you choose to go
the breast-feeding route.

721
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:20,572
You guys, I'm sure Brian
is not interested in this.

722
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:21,675
Breast-feeding, huh?

723
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,975
Yeah. I mean,
some people go with the formula deal,

724
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:25,318
which is cool, too.

725
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:27,620
Actually, for baby number two,
we did use formula.

726
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:28,321
Yeah?

727
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:31,878
I mean, if you use formula,
the old lady can smoke, drink,

728
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:35,196
eat as many tacos as she wants --
no problemo.

729
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,368
You hear that, babe?

730
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,660
Yeah. Tacos. Thrilling.

731
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:40,770
Why can't they make books
out of something lighter?

732
00:28:40,782 --> 00:28:41,672
Lighter than paper?

733
00:28:41,683 --> 00:28:43,139
I'm being punished
for being generous.

734
00:28:43,152 --> 00:28:45,026
That's what you get for
having so many smart friends.

735
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:46,627
So I think we're doing well.

736
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:47,618
Yeah, I think we're done.

737
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:49,258
Oh wait, Babette.
Do we have something for Babette?

738
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:51,022
The needlepoint pillow
with the sassy saying.

739
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:53,976
Oh yeah.
Hey, you know, it's kind of impressive

740
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,007
when people curse
in needlepoint.

741
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:57,303
There's something
laborious about it.

742
00:28:57,337 --> 00:28:59,999
And I got cologne for Michel and
the same cologne for my mother.

743
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:00,603
Weird.

744
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:01,837
Well, they'll both hate
whatever I give them,

745
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:04,120
so I figured,
why spend time picking out doomed gifts?

746
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:07,161
Then I have whatever Williams-Sonoma
sold me for Sookie --

747
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:10,373
a butter slicer,
a bread warmer/wine maker.

748
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,080
Well, I'm sure she'll
love her butter slicer.

749
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:15,295
If that's even what it is. I swear, they
could attach a stone to a piece of string

750
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:17,492
and call it a poultry pounder,
and I'd shell out 35 bucks.

751
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,236
So I guess all we need is dad.

752
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,031
I really want to get
him something great.

753
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:22,026
We have the sweater.

754
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,361
And the really heavy book.

755
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:26,419
But I want to get him something
that he'll really love.

756
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:28,394
Well, we will.
I mean, we'll find something.

757
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:31,433
We have a whole mall here full of
post-Christmas prices. We'll find something.

758
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:33,345
Guys are tricky,
but your dad's really tricky.

759
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,330
What does he need?
What does he want?

760
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:36,622
Perhaps a poultry pounder.

761
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:38,167
Plus, he is my husband now.

762
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:39,626
I've never bought
something for a husband.

763
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,841
I wish they had a special
store for husband stuff.

764
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:43,088
Hey!

765
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:45,361
What do you think?

766
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:46,291
Maybe.

767
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:47,794
I think he'd love it. Come on.

768
00:29:48,608 --> 00:29:50,952
Oh, look at this one.

769
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:54,012
Doesn't work so good
inside, though.

770
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,746
Solar systems, 50% off!

771
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,143
That's not just a post-Christmas sale.
That's a post-Pluto sale.

772
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:00,320
- Poor Pluto.
- Oh, poor Pluto.

773
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:02,844
Hey, um, it's Luke.

774
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:07,464
Hi.

775
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:10,344
- I guess we should...
- Yeah.

776
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:13,689
- Oh! Hey!
- Hey.

777
00:30:13,704 --> 00:30:15,849
- Hey, Rory.
- Hey, Luke. Hey, April.

778
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:16,855
- Hey.
- Hey.

779
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:18,170
- Hi.
- Hi, April.

780
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:19,300
Hi.

781
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:22,879
April showed up at the
diner today out of the blue.

782
00:30:22,893 --> 00:30:24,651
You make it sound like
Pearl Harbor or something.

783
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:27,913
No, I mean, it was a surprise --
a nice surprise.

784
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,305
So, how's it going?

785
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:31,776
- It's -- I'm almost done.
- Done?

786
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:33,649
You're not talking
about the letter.

787
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:35,094
You're just asking in general.

788
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,143
I meant, how's it going?

789
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:38,164
Good. I'm good. We're good.

790
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:40,429
Hey, I like your sweaters.
They're very festive.

791
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:42,163
Thank you.
It's Christmas for us.

792
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:43,516
Rory was in London at
the end of december,

793
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:45,110
so we waited to do
Christmas together.

794
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:46,152
Of course you did.

795
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,483
- Sir, do you have a return?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

796
00:30:49,678 --> 00:30:51,476
So, April,
how was your Christmas?

797
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:54,842
Well, I'm 60% atheist
and 40% agnostic,

798
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,791
so Christmas isn't really
a big deal for me.

799
00:30:56,802 --> 00:30:58,389
Oh, really? 60/40, huh?

800
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:00,434
- More of a winter solstice gal?
- Exactly.

801
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:02,419
You went to London by
yourself over Christmas?

802
00:31:02,432 --> 00:31:04,692
Oh, I wasn't exactly by myself.
I met my boyfriend there.

803
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:07,819
Oh. Meeting a lover in a foreign city --
how glamorous.

804
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,420
I can't wait to be
grown up and glamorous

805
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:12,385
and be able to make my own
decisions about where I go and when.

806
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:13,850
Being a kid is the
pits sometimes.

807
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:15,127
It sure is.

808
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:16,659
Oh, thanks.

809
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:18,311
What'd you get?

810
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:21,418
Well, my dad got me the greatest
present ever -- a rock-polishing kit --

811
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:23,978
but I had already gotten
it from my grandma,

812
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:25,887
who's very into Christmas.

813
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,706
So we exchanged it
for this microscope,

814
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,252
which is also the
greatest present.

815
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:31,794
- Good.
- Wow. That's great.

816
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,394
My dad's always been
a great gift giver.

817
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,526
I guess I don't know if I
was always considered so good

818
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:37,567
at picking out presents,
right, Rory?

819
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:39,545
Oh, no,
you've always been great.

820
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,126
- Towels?
- What towels.

821
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:43,292
- You meant well.
- You gave her towels?

822
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,213
For my birthday.

823
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,257
I had them monogrammed.
I thought it was cool.

824
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,349
Yes, you went through quite
the monogramming phase.

825
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:51,386
I believe you received monogrammed
pencils, a monogrammed mug,

826
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:53,728
a monogrammed backpack,
and a monogrammed belt.

827
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,248
No one ever tried to steal that belt.
Those were my favorite towels.

828
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,371
I still have the washcloth.

829
00:31:57,387 --> 00:31:58,562
That's hilarious.

830
00:31:58,574 --> 00:32:00,919
Remember the year you got me the
unicorn marionette with the purple horn?

831
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,465
You didn't like the
unicorn marionette?

832
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,383
I've never really been
that into unicorns.

833
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:05,533
I thought you loved that.

834
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:06,944
I know,
because I was being polite.

835
00:32:06,957 --> 00:32:08,268
Being polite can be dangerous.

836
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,956
Yes, it totally backfired,

837
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,879
because for the next five years,
I only got unicorn items --

838
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:15,392
unicorn sweatshirt,
unicorn pencil case,

839
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:17,570
bumper sticker --
"I brake for unicorns."

840
00:32:17,584 --> 00:32:19,908
You were always so nice.
You never forgot my birthday.

841
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:22,287
And every holiday,
there was a monogrammed unicorn item.

842
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:24,638
Dad, for the record,
I'm not really into unicorns, either.

843
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,699
Well, I'm glad to know it.
Anyway, we should get going.

844
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:28,070
I got to get you home, kiddo.

845
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:30,361
Well, we have to buy up
all the Pluto stuff.

846
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:31,677
It's really gonna be
a collector's item.

847
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,559
Sure.

848
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:34,581
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye. Have a merry Christmas.

849
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:35,848
Merry Christmas.

850
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:43,058
Honey, let me carry that.

851
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:44,344
- No, thank you.
- Lane, come on.

852
00:32:44,358 --> 00:32:46,090
I'm perfectly capable of
carrying a bag of groceries.

853
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:48,620
Nutter butters? I put those
nutter butters back on the shelf.

854
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,858
I took them off of the shelf.

855
00:32:49,871 --> 00:32:51,863
Your mom doesn't think you
should be eating many cookies.

856
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:54,450
Enough about my mom, okay?
Enough. I'm so sick of her.

857
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:57,061
She's been pretty great, Lane.
She cooks for us, cleans for us.

858
00:32:57,074 --> 00:32:58,758
She's a total fountain
of baby information.

859
00:32:58,772 --> 00:33:00,696
You know what? Maybe you should
have married my mom, then, okay?

860
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,630
Well, I'm sure when
your mom was younger...

861
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:05,165
Hey, I'm just saying,
she's a handsome woman.

862
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:07,042
What? I'm just saying that
I bet when she was younger,

863
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:08,522
she used to look a
little like you --

864
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:11,252
shorter hair, no glasses,
maybe a bit more crabby. Maybe.

865
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:12,607
Well, I'm sick of her.

866
00:33:12,622 --> 00:33:14,334
- That's kind of harsh.
- I am. I'm sick oh her.

867
00:33:14,364 --> 00:33:16,719
I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of
being treated like I'm not a person,

868
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:19,637
like I'm some incubator whose
puffy ankles and varicose veins

869
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:21,486
and bathroom habits
are up for discussion.

870
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,509
On what planet is it
appropriate to ask a person

871
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,024
how many times a
day she urinates?

872
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:26,819
- You can ask me.
- I don't want to ask you.

873
00:33:26,832 --> 00:33:29,159
Six times today so far.
I had a lot of coffee.

874
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,567
I'm sick of being told what
to eat and what I shouldn't

875
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:33,617
and what side I should
sleep on when I lie down.

876
00:33:33,631 --> 00:33:35,545
I'm a person, Zach.
I'm an adult.

877
00:33:35,562 --> 00:33:37,224
I don't want to be hiding
things under the floorboards

878
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:38,434
and behind cushions again.

879
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,791
Yeah, that's no good. Plus,
we're starting to get ants and mites.

880
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:42,326
I don't want
everything to change

881
00:33:42,342 --> 00:33:43,689
just because we're
having these babies.

882
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:46,085
But things are going to change.
There's no getting around it.

883
00:33:46,102 --> 00:33:48,789
Really, really soon,
we're gonna have two babies --

884
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:50,171
two alive human sons.

885
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:51,822
It was such a small window --

886
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:53,692
a peephole, really.

887
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:55,467
For years,
I was this repressed kid,

888
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:58,525
and then there was the
briefest of windows.

889
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,115
And then -- slam.

890
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:02,974
All of a sudden,
I'm this overburdened mother.

891
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,779
I barely got to do it, Zach.

892
00:34:04,803 --> 00:34:06,589
I barely got the
chance to be a person.

893
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:09,325
No, no, you can still be a person
and still be rock 'n' roll.

894
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,336
Having babies doesn't mean
you can't be rock 'n' roll.

895
00:34:11,372 --> 00:34:12,316
I don't know.

896
00:34:12,331 --> 00:34:14,896
Give me a break. Sonic Youth has a kid,
and they're still way cool.

897
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:15,663
Yeah.

898
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,648
And Mick Jagger --
that cat has like 15 kids,

899
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:18,980
and he still goes
out and rocks.

900
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:19,864
Yeah, I guess.

901
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:22,904
For sure, the man rocks hard,
and then he makes another kid.

902
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,859
I don't want to make
any other kids ever.

903
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,192
All I'm saying is,
we can still go out and play.

904
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:30,337
That's one of the cool things
about having your mother around --

905
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:32,427
- built-in babysitter.
- Yeah.

906
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:34,853
I just don't think I can bear
having her around all the time.

907
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:37,403
What about weekends? What if she
hung out with us on the weekends

908
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:39,103
and spent the week
back at her pad?

909
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:41,239
Yeah, I guess that'd
be all right.

910
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,678
Let me carry that bag for you.

911
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:55,589
I had such a good
time with you today.

912
00:34:55,602 --> 00:34:57,766
I was thinking that
tuesdays after school,

913
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,281
I could tell mom that
I have chess club.

914
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:01,235
And I really only have
chess club once a week,

915
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:02,801
but I could pretend
it's twice a week.

916
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:05,505
And so as soon as school's over,
I could bike halfway to Stars Hollow,

917
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,038
and you could meet me.
I could hide in the bushes

918
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:10,186
and do prearranged bird calls,
like a mourning dove or something --

919
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,981
A "coo-roo coo-roo
coo-roo" as a signal.

920
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:16,982
Yeah, I don't think so.

921
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,412
I don't need to do
the bird calls.

922
00:35:18,428 --> 00:35:20,667
It wouldn't be right, April.
It woudn't.

923
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,238
We can't lie to your mother.

924
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:26,268
Your mother and I are not totally
seeing eye to eye on certain things,

925
00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:28,827
and so we're sort
of in negotiations

926
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:33,018
to figure out how to share our
parenting responsibilities.

927
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,543
Do you have a good lawyer?

928
00:35:34,643 --> 00:35:37,429
You better have a good one,
'cause mom hired a shark.

929
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:39,972
We're gonna figure that out.
Don't worry about it, okay?

930
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:42,437
But the court case is the reason
that it's really important

931
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:45,478
that we do everything
honestly and aboveboard.

932
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:47,384
Yeah. I guess that makes sense.

933
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:51,431
Okay. So...
what should we do with the microscope?

934
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:52,287
Keep it.

935
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:54,434
I'll use it the next
time I'm over -- soon.

936
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:55,430
Okay.

937
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,872
You can set it up if you want.

938
00:35:56,885 --> 00:35:59,767
Just make sure that you
always remove the slide

939
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:02,309
before you rotate the lenses,
or you can grind things up.

940
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:04,417
And always carry it with
a hand under the base.

941
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:05,922
I'll be very careful.

942
00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:12,483
- Bye.
- Bye.

943
00:36:19,057 --> 00:36:21,078
Don't forget to
put your helmet on.

944
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:41,400
# I'll be home for Christmas #

945
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:48,121
# You can plan on me #

946
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:55,936
# Please have snow and mistletoe #

947
00:36:55,951 --> 00:37:03,514
# And presents on the tree #

948
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:06,610
Look at this -- liquid sugar.

949
00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:08,395
It's good for you, this stuff.

950
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,948
You think?

951
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:11,877
You like the red or the green?

952
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:15,475
Red? Red the best?
I like red, too.

953
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:18,418
Little. Little.

954
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:20,564
- That's dripping.
- That's dripping.

955
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:21,936
You're making a mess, dad.

956
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:24,861
I'm not very good
with the cookies.

957
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:26,934
And what do we say
if anyone asks?

958
00:37:26,948 --> 00:37:30,443
We made cookies by scratching.

959
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,102
"From scratch."

960
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,533
From scratching.

961
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:35,353
Well, let's hope nobody asks.

962
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,898
Hey, G.G.,
you want to lick the beater?

963
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:38,703
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

964
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:40,667
- Hey.
- Hey.

965
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,864
We're making some
cookies by scratching.

966
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:45,397
That sounds appetizing. I'm gonna run
out for a sec. I'll be right back.

967
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,919
Okay, hurry back. "Christmas in
july" screening in 30 minutes.

968
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,134
Thought we'd start
a new tradition.

969
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:50,458
Sounds good.

970
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,932
G.G., I think we need
some of the colors.

971
00:37:53,944 --> 00:37:55,533
Can you put some
sprinkles on that one?

972
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:57,161
You want to decorate that one?

973
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:08,884
# Please have snow #

974
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:13,755
# And mistletoe #

975
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:23,803
# And presents on the tree #

976
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:35,072
# Christmas Eve will find me #
