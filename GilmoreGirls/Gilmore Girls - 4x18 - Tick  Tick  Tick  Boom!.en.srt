1
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:10,105
All right, Davey, here comes the airplane.

2
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:13,336
What did they say to kids to get them to open their mouths before there were planes?

3
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:15,199
- "Here comes the choo-choo." 
- And before there were trains?

4
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,324
- "Here comes the spoon." 
- That's so on the nose.

5
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:20,190
One more bite, honey. Come on, now. Here comes the airplane again.

6
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:22,987
It's flying through the air. It's beginning its descent.

7
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:25,972
It's commencing its approach. It's lowering the landing gear.

8
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:28,404
It's signaled the ground crew. They're flipping their flashlight thingies.

9
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,781
Would you shove that in the kid's mouth?

10
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:32,627
Oh, look -- it's Bilbo Baloneypuss just in from the shire.

11
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:34,609
- Just hurry up and order. 
- What's the rush?

12
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:35,765
I don't like babies.

13
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:40,047
I suddenly felt violently protective.

14
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:42,919
- It's gone. 
- It's the noise they make.

15
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:45,716
- This baby has not made a peep. 
- He will and at the worst possible moment.

16
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:48,854
- Like when you're defusing a bomb or something? 
- That would be awkward.

17
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:51,387
You've got one minute to order, then six minutes to eat.

18
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:54,266
Yessiree, come on down to Luke's, where the motto is "eat it, then beat it."

19
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:54,823
One minute.

20
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:57,091
Hello, all.

21
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:00,311
- Taylor. 
- Top o' the morning to you.

22
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:03,589
- Top o' the... 
- Yeah, on top there, you got the...

23
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:06,344
- It's definitely -- it's a... 
- Beautiful top. It's...

24
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,727
Top o' the morning right back at you. You were just on a cruise, weren't you?

25
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,555
Yes, and it was heaven. The Caribbean -- ever been?

26
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,307
- I'm sorry. What did you say? 
- Ever been to the Caribbean?

27
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:18,856
God, I'm sorry. I missed it again.

28
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:22,953
Never mind. Luke, I have an issue I need to discuss with you.

29
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:24,990
Good -- something to write about in my diary.

30
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:27,521
There is a distinct odor outside our establishments,

31
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:29,256
and I have to assume it's coming from the diner.

32
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:30,821
There's no odor coming from my diner.

33
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:33,669
It wasn't there when I left for my trip. Where else could it be emanating from?

34
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:36,162
I don't know. Have you checked underneath that thing on your head?

35
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,132
- I'm combing it differently. 
- The comb didn't loosen the glue?

36
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:43,682
You know, I smelled something, too, but it was across the square.

37
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:46,376
Me, too, over by the hair stand -- newsstand.

38
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:48,292
I smelled it by Gypsy's -- horrible.

39
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,965
So the whole town smells? How can that be possible?

40
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:54,047
- It is an old town -- 200 years. 
- So, it's decaying from age?

41
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:57,780
- Or we've got skunks again. 
- I think you're right, Taylor!

42
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,319
Ten years ago we got infested. They crawled under houses,

43
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,766
met their fate, and the town smelled for weeks.

44
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:05,485
That must be it, Taylor! Good work. Good work!

45
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:08,634
Thank you, Kirk. I'm going to have to mobilize the community.

46
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,219
We've got the flower show coming up. We have to deal with this quickly.

47
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:15,510
Let me go door to door and make sure every townsman looks under his house, Taylor.

48
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:18,455
I'll even knock some heads together -- get medieval on their ass.

49
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:22,525
That's a nice offer, Kirk, but the block captains will see it gets done.

50
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,050
I better start making my calls.

51
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:26,943
- Your minute's up. Order. 
- We're not ready.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,515
Then it's coming out of your eating time.

53
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:30,967
Hey, get violently protective so Luke will back off.

54
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,072
- I don't know if I can summon it like that. 
- Try.

55
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,869
- Luke. 
- In five minutes, you're all gone.

56
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:40,245
I let you down.

57
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,570
The "argh" was good, and then you kind of petered out.

58
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,714
-  I need to practice more. 
- You'll get it there.

59
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:45,600
Read, read.

60
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,524
- Try it against that wall there. 
- We've already tried it there.

61
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,052
- It's no problem. 
- No problem for you,

62
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:53,247
but this is giving me cuticle damage. Do you know how long cuticle damage takes to heal?

63
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,613
- Thank God, no. 
- No, it doesn't work there either.

64
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,783
What an enormous shock.

65
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,776
Anywhere else you want to try it --

66
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:02,647
maybe at the Lincoln Memorial on his giant lap?

67
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:05,207
- How 'bout over there? 
- Yeah, there.

68
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,265
I'm sending you my manicure bill.

69
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:09,543
- Yes, mine, too. 
- Don't be snotty.

70
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,961
Seems a little out of place no matter where you put it.

71
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:13,056
Yeah, unfortunately.

72
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,277
If you'd ordered it from me, I would have guaranteed it. You didn't order it from me.

73
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:18,682
I know, we ordered it before we hired you. We should have waited.

74
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,955
- It's always best to do it through your contractor. 
- I don't think it fits here.

75
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:25,447
- Oh, my God, I'm getting a blister. 
- Hey, how about by the front desk?

76
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:28,309
- We could give it a shot. 
- That's it! I'm jumping off the Amistad.

77
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,361
This is heavy, my back hurts, I'm not moving it again.

78
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:31,130
No problem.

79
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:33,925
I can do it.

80
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,293
- It's not me. It really is heavy. 
- You mean here?

81
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:41,160
- They already tried it there. 
- I think it's a lost cause.

82
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:44,232
- We've got the Dennis Kucinich of bookcases. 
- I wish you'd gone through me.

83
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:46,188
I could just give it to Rory. She could use it at Yale.

84
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:48,046
- Hi, everybody. 
- Hi!

85
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,372
- Hi, Michel. 
- Hi, Lindsay.

86
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:53,315
Are you okay? You're standing kind of funny.

87
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:56,976
It's nothing funny. It is how you stand in these pants.

88
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:01,676
- Keys, please. 
- You got it.

89
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:05,194
Annette and Frankie really found each other.

90
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,677
They float together. Y'know, they just sort of float.

91
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,838
- It's off-the-charts adorable. 
- Yep.

92
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:12,556
The Deans of the world always get the Lindsays.

93
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:15,387
The pretty little things just like the bookcase lifters.

94
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:17,646
That's a category -- jocks, nerds, bookcase lifters?

95
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:20,534
I was born with this bad back. It was heretical.

96
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,337
Congenital.

97
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,686
Well, I hate that bookcase. I wish you had never ordered it.

98
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,066
I wish you had never thought of it. I can't even be in the same room with it,

99
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:30,876
- mocking me for how alone I am. 
- It's mocking you?

100
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:34,511
- It's three pieces of wood. 
- Well, I hate it -- hate it, hate it, hate it!

101
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,202
If you had ordered it from me, he wouldn't be experiencing this psychological trauma.

102
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:46,129
I mean, they were extremely common until just recently -- historically recently,

103
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:49,606
not recently like "metrosexual is a word now" recently, but recently.

104
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:53,728
- Are we still talking about anvils? 
- Yes, where did all the anvils go?

105
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,037
You're talking about those big, heavy, metal things?

106
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:58,965
That blacksmiths hammered horseshoes and stuff on. Everyone had them.

107
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:02,667
They were featured prominently in every movie western, so where did they all go?

108
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,285
I don't know that they were that common.

109
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:06,978
Wile E. Coyote used them. That's how common they were.

110
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:08,057
- Who? 
- The cartoon.

111
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,946
He was always trying to drop an anvil on the Road Runner's head

112
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:14,545
or shoot it at him out of a giant slingshot or fire it at him out of a cannon.

113
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:18,421
Inevitably, the cannon tilted up, shot it in the air, it fell down,

114
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:21,166
and made an anvil-shaped impression on Wile E. Coyote's head.

115
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:23,908
- This is a cartoon? 
- No, no, this just happened to me the other day.

116
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:27,044
I was walking down the street, and this giant anvil -- yes, mother, it's a cartoon.

117
00:07:27,116 --> 00:07:29,491
I know she sounds nuts, but it's a very common cartoon.

118
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,667
But that doesn't prove that anvils were so common.

119
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:34,933
It does. It proves that anvils were so ubiquitous at one point --

120
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,216
- is that the word, ubiquitous? 
- It depends on where you're going.

121
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:40,381
That they knew that children would know what they were and delight in them.

122
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:43,197
That's how common they were -- children watching cartoons.

123
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,638
- That was the word. 
- I've forgotten your point.

124
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:47,360
Where are all the anvils?

125
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:51,686
I mean, is there some sort of secret anvil storage facility the government is keeping from us?

126
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:55,285
Or they fell into disuse with the advent of other technologies,

127
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:57,195
and so they melted them down and they're gone.

128
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:58,403
But they're not supposed to melt.

129
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:01,410
They were made to withstand the red-hot hammer of the town blacksmith.

130
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,476
This is easily the most pointless conversation we've ever had.

131
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:06,641
I don't hear anyone chiming in with rational theories.

132
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,631
Please change the subject, I beg of you, anyone.

133
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:12,955
Well the girls don't know the big news about Jason and me.

134
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:13,681
You're pregnant?

135
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,644
- We're acquiring another company. 
- I was close.

136
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,059
Already? You just started yours.

137
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:21,029
The insurance business is changing so rapidly, you have to adapt to keep up.

138
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:23,764
- It's a dog-eat-dog world, Grandpa. 
- Don't get the wrong idea.

139
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,687
It's not a big company. It's smaller than ours, but very powerful.

140
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:30,210
Wait, the company is smaller than yours? Your company is two guys -- you and Jason.

141
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:32,841
This company is a one-man operation -- Bob Sutton.

142
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,500
So, you're acquiring Bob?

143
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:37,305
We're acquiring his company, and his company is him.

144
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,246
Did he have to give himself two weeks' notice?

145
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,806
Is there gonna be a sad little going-away party where he brings in his own cake

146
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,115
and blows out his candles?

147
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:47,499
We are all celebrating with a dinner tomorrow -- us and the wives.

148
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,940
- You're not big on the Bob? 
- Bob's fine. We've known him for years.

149
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,920
It's that dolt he's married to -- classic trophy wife.

150
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,671
- She is quite young. 
- How young?

151
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:57,498
Her car looks just like Barbie's.

152
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:59,875
Regardless, I hope you will be kind to her at dinner.

153
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:02,194
I'll have to bring my English-to-dumbbell dictionary.

154
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,723
Try and focus on Bob. Bob's as sharp as they come.

155
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,634
He's very brilliant, I'll give you that.

156
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:08,686
- Bob's brilliant, huh? 
- He's a Rhodes scholar.

157
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,386
Ask him where the anvils went.

158
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:13,566
Or not.

159
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:21,057
And forty-seven cents comes to $5. Thank you, Mrs. Cassini.

160
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:23,432
Thank you. I don't know what it is about you, Taylor,

161
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:27,222
but you look so healthy, so invigorated, so youthful.

162
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:29,659
Thank you, Mrs. Cassini. Must be the vacation.

163
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:30,955
Or the fake hair.

164
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:33,653
Come again, Mrs. Cassini.

165
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:38,702
Tracy, change out the scoop water. It's an unsightly color.

166
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:41,486
And tell Franklin when he gets here...

167
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:45,427
tell him that he keeps forgetting to punch out...

168
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:49,669
- Kirk, something wrong? 
- Well, I...

169
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,515
Don't touch the candy.

170
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry. I didn't want to touch the candy. It's just…

171
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:57,645
Kirk, I just had a spat with my sourball distributor, and I'm not in the mood.

172
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:58,536
Now, what's the trouble?

173
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,654
- It's eggs. 
- What? What's eggs?

174
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:05,176
In the square -- the smell. It's not skunks, it's eggs.

175
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,906
- Easter eggs from the Easter egg hunt. 
- But Easter was over a week ago.

176
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:12,667
And I did it just like you told me. I personally hid 300 eggs around the town square,

177
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:16,651
and the kids had a blast hunting them down, except the Banyan boys.

178
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:18,795
They're bad seeds. Going to hell -- both of them.

179
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:22,517
But the kids only found 241 of them.

180
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:26,886
Are you telling me that there are fifty-nine rotting eggs hidden in the square?

181
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:30,537
I thought they would naturally decompose and just disappear.

182
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:35,155
- Eggs smell when they decompose. 
- I just found that out.

183
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:41,093
I find your hair very believable.

184
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,712
Nice shot. Beautiful!

185
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:51,384
You're being extremely charitable.

186
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:53,331
Oh, Richard, if I get that far on four shots,

187
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:55,522
it would be a miracle on the order of loaves and fishes.

188
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,915
Yeah, and I'm in the sand.

189
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:00,059
I don't think any of us are gonna make Tiger shake in his spikes.

190
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,509
I'd go with a driver or 3-wood.

191
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,563
Whatever is gonna make me look less like Dorf.

192
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:10,458
You know, my wife's very excited about the merger, Richard -- very excited.

193
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:14,195
Oh, do give Trish our best. Emily and I were just talking about her -- terrific girl.

194
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,309
At least he held onto the club this time.

195
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:24,092
Now, it's hard to know whether he should yell "fore!" Or "duck!"

196
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:29,315
Why can't businessmen do deals over air hockey? I am great at air hockey.

197
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,044
- Oh, looky here. 
- Hmm? Your father?

198
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:36,179
One of the many hazards on this golf course.

199
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:37,323
I thought that was you.

200
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,548
Groundskeeper must be unhappy that you're here today.

201
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,113
Divots -- I do produce a lot of divots. Good one.

202
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,708
- Richard, nice to see you. 
- Same here, Floyd.

203
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:48,673
And, Bob, didn't know you were a duffer.

204
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,134
- More like spoiling a good walk. 
- You want to play through, Floyd?

205
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:55,827
Actually, I was heading back to the clubhouse, and you caught my eye.

206
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:57,905
- How's Emily? 
- She's fine.

207
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:00,972
- Good health? 
- Very good. And Carol?

208
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:05,662
Fine, fine. You know, she really misses Emily -- misses her company.

209
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,008
And vice versa, I'm sure.

210
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:08,969
You couldn't drag those two apart at a function.

211
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:12,297
- They were like conjoined twins. 
- I know she'd love to see Emily again.

212
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:13,853
I'm sure the feeling is mutual.

213
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:15,826
Then, perhaps we should get those two together.

214
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,119
Well, we could arrange that.

215
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:20,771
- I can tell Carol to give her a call. 
- Any time.

216
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,333
You know, if it's a meal, we men could tag along if they'd let us.

217
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,365
That's a big "if," but that could happen.

218
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:31,343
- Maybe Jason could tag along, too. 
- That would be a nice little gathering.

219
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:33,990
I'm out of town next week, but this Friday's free.

220
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,806
- Friday would be perfect. 
- I hope it happens.

221
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:38,451
- I hope so, too. 
- Glad to run into you.

222
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:40,724
- Same here, Floyd. 
- Bob, Jason.

223
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,260
He wants to have dinner.

224
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,170
- Was it Carol's idea or Floyd's? 
- It's hard to say.

225
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:53,011
- This is very good, Richard. 
- It was public. The whole club saw.

226
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,915
But did he say that Carol had wanted it or that he had wanted it?

227
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:57,558
- What did you hear? 
- I was out of earshot.

228
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,922
Rapprochement with Floyd Stiles. Never in my wildest dreams.

229
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,709
And it came from him. Who saw this coming?

230
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:05,187
Did he bring up Carol before or after he brought up the dinner?

231
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:08,240
- I didn't have a tape recorder, Emily. 
- I'll offer to host it here.

232
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,875
I've got the perfect menu. Friday, right? So it's Lorelai and Rory, too.

233
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,480
Well, Friday was his suggestion. I wasn't in a position to counter.

234
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,564
- No, of course not. That's fine. 
- And he saw us with Bob, too.

235
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:18,842
- And still he made the offer. 
- Acquiring Bob was a great idea.

236
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,749
There'll be seven of us. That's an unbalanced table, but that's okay. Oh, this is wonderful!

237
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,357
Floyd wants peace.

238
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:25,616
So it seems.

239
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:31,709
- Dean. 
- Surprise.

240
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:32,757
What are you doing here?

241
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,708
- I come bearing gifts. 
- A bookcase?

242
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:39,455
Yeah, the one from the inn. Do you see what's going on out there?

243
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,354
Almost there, almost there.

244
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:45,738
Thanks for the help.

245
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,575
Should I give him a hand?

246
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,246
If he doesn't work for his inebriation, he won't appreciate it.

247
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,417
There's a big party on Friday night. It must be for that.

248
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:55,835
Yeah? You going?

249
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:59,131
I have two papers due, so I'll be in Stars Hollow avoiding the fray.

250
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:00,489
I'll just have a brewski there.

251
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,099
So, which way's your room?

252
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:05,052
Thataway.

253
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:08,737
So, where did this come from?

254
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:11,872
Well, your mom had it made for the Dragonfly, but it didn't fit,

255
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:14,201
so she thought you could use it here.

256
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,531
- She didn't tell you? 
- Nope.

257
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:18,701
- Small. 
- Yes.

258
00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:21,644
- There's no place to put this. 
- Yes again.

259
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,005
What was your mom thinking?

260
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,831
That I have books, and that's probably the extent of it.

261
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:30,565
- Right. So, I guess I'll take it back. 
- I'm sorry you had to make the trip.

262
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:34,036
No, it's okay. It's kind of nice seeing where you live.

263
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,418
So, are you on your way back to school?

264
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,471
Oh, no, I'm just off from work.

265
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:44,680
- I'm actually gonna take a little break from that. 
- From what, school?

266
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,113
Yeah, just for a semester or two, you know.

267
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:50,015
A semester or two? But I thought it was going so well.

268
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:53,609
It was. It's just that Lindsay and I really need some extra money right now,

269
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:56,769
- and this job with Tom has been perfect. 
- Extra money for what?

270
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,358
- What do you mean? For life, things. 
- What kind of things?

271
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:05,535
Well, Lindsay's got her heart set on having a townhouse by the end of the year,

272
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,833
and we're kind of cramped where we are, so I think it's a good idea.

273
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:08,969
- You do? 
- Yeah.

274
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:10,567
- I don't. 
- What?

275
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:12,036
I think it's a horrible idea.

276
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:15,304
- It's just temporary. 
- Maybe.

277
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,340
A lot of people who drop out say that it's just temporary.

278
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:21,088
- It usually doesn't work out that way. 
- I'm gonna go back.

279
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:23,481
- I hope so. 
- Have some faith, will you?

280
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:25,005
I just think this is a mistake.

281
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,852
Rory, I'm married, remember? I have responsibilities.

282
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:29,859
- You'll lose your momentum. 
- I need the money.

283
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:32,670
- Can't the townhouse wait? 
- Jeez, lighten up.

284
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:34,326
I just think this is a really bad idea.

285
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,880
Graduating from college doesn't guarantee you a job anymore.

286
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:39,122
- It's not like it was with our parents. 
- So you're not going back?

287
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,954
- You're twisting my words. 
- And you're just gonna work in construction?

288
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,465
- What, are you gonna get all elitist on me now? 
- We're friends, so I get to tell you what I think.

289
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:47,134
- Fine. 
- You should go to school.

290
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:50,043
Great. Now you've told me three times. I get it.

291
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:51,732
You don't need to tell me again, okay?

292
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,307
- You want me to take this now? 
- Yes...

293
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,030
- No. Whatever you want. 
- I'll take it now.

294
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:03,883
Fine.

295
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:12,392
Attention, please! Everybody, if I may!

296
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,990
Let's have some attention, people!

297
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:19,114
We all know why we're here. There are fifty-nine rotting Easter eggs

298
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:21,706
hidden throughout the square, and we've got to find them.

299
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:24,138
I know what you're thinking -- what about the map,

300
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:27,834
the careful, detailed map of where the eggs are hidden

301
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:31,787
made each year to avoid catastrophes such as this?

302
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:36,364
Well, a map was not made this year, good townsfolk.

303
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:38,432
One was not made.

304
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:42,345
Now, this work is going to be exhausting and, yes, disgusting,

305
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:48,023
but as my way of thanking you, help yourself to lunch at Doose's market,

306
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:52,258
where everything in our prepared-foods section will be discounted 5%,

307
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,797
20% for our day-old sushi.

308
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:59,124
Now, with the flower show due in three days,

309
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,231
we have a clock on this, people, but when I look out

310
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:06,870
at this fine group of volunteers, my heart races with pride.

311
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:09,875
I see America,

312
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,225
and I am proud.

313
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:15,037
- Now, are there any questions? 
- What's with the toupee?

314
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:18,249
- It's not a toupee. 
- And I'm blond and leggy.

315
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,670
Are there any legitimate questions from anyone?

316
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:22,855
- Yes, Joe? 
- I'm Jewish.

317
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:25,056
Well, that's swell.

318
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:29,126
- Is it okay for a Jew to hunt Easter eggs? 
- That's between you and your Rabbi.

319
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,605
- Jackson, a question? 
- Toupee guy says what?

320
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:32,255
What?

321
00:17:33,438 --> 00:17:36,658
- What are you laughing about? 
- Jackson said, "Toupee guy says what?"

322
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:41,163
Inspiring your understandable response of "what?" Thus soliciting their childish laughter.

323
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:42,936
It's infantile and a total clam.

324
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:47,973
Please report every found egg to me, and I will keep the running total.

325
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,810
Now, good luck, and let the hunt begin.

326
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,931
We won't let you down, Taylor,

327
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,950
because not only are we gonna find twenty eggs within the hour,

328
00:17:57,103 --> 00:18:00,504
but we're going on to find twenty-five... and then thirty...

329
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:05,085
and then thirty-five... and then forty... and then forty-five

330
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:10,738
and then fifty until we find all fifty-nine and take back the square!

331
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:17,209
- Hurt your throat? 
- Very badly.

332
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,866
- Found one! 
- Fifty-eight to go.

333
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,469
Good job, Joe.

334
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,384
Okay, dinner is ready when the cow moos.

335
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:34,326
- How about here? 
- Not there.

336
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:35,427
- Why not? 
- It's dark.

337
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:38,196
Yeah, that's the point. It's a dark corner. The plant livens it up.

338
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:40,255
- Plants need light. 
- They do?

339
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:42,605
It's the "photo" part of photosynthesize.

340
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:44,489
Oh, don't some plants just synthesize?

341
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:46,137
They really need the photo part.

342
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:47,806
None of the plants I ever had needed light.

343
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:48,698
Any of them live?

344
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,175
No. Whoa, insight!

345
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:52,758
Poor thing doesn't stand a chance.

346
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,234
- Hey, so, you ready for Friday? 
- Ohh, dinner with my parents?

347
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:59,127
- You haven't seen them in a while. 
- Well, I've seen Mom occasionally,

348
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:01,147
but Floyd and I really haven't spoken since the great schism,

349
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:04,615
not that Harry Chapin isn't dying to rise from the grave and write a song about us.

350
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:07,289
- I'm a little nervous. 
- Yeah, I get that.

351
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:11,631
And he's gonna call me "Digger." Oh, he loves calling me "Digger."

352
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:14,277
And he has hated every girl I have ever dated.

353
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:16,788
- Really? 
- Yeah, mom, too.

354
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:19,954
It's some sort of reverse Oedipal thing. And not just the ones I pick.

355
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:22,987
They set me up with a girl they loved, and as soon as they found out I liked her,

356
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:25,557
they turned on her viciously. She moved to Alaska.

357
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,226
- Why are you telling me this? 
- Just a heads up.

358
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:29,340
All it's gonna do is make me nervous, and it has.

359
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,954
They don't know I'm going out with you, so it doesn't matter.

360
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:32,163
Well, they'll find out eventually.

361
00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:35,500
Well, impress them now when they don't know. Preempt their gathering hatred.

362
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:38,669
- Unless they end up hating me retroactively. 
- Oh, I have seen that, too.

363
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:40,643
- Tony Robbins has nothing on you. 
- Sorry.

364
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:43,421
- Ooh, how about here? 
- On the chair?

365
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:45,106
Yeah, it's not a very comfortable chair.

366
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,093
- How about I just get a new chair? 
- That'll work.

367
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:50,680
You know, in a warped way, you being nervous has made me less nervous.

368
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:52,504
- So there's a bright side. 
- Not that that was my intent.

369
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,231
Good to know.

370
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:54,742
Dinner.

371
00:19:57,594 --> 00:20:00,538
There was a death-to-disco movement in the late '70s -- very intense.

372
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,282
- We had Donna Summer on the run. 
- "We?" You weren't born yet.

373
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,202
- I'm a kindred spirit. 
- Gotcha.

374
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:07,634
So where's the passion now, huh? Where is it?

375
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,759
There's disco to kill anymore. They wiped it out.

376
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:13,533
But there are other things that need wiping out -- phony rappers, most techno,

377
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:16,992
alt country, Christian rock, anything fusion, classic alternative radio,

378
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,132
where all they do is play the same Nirvana song over and over --

379
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:21,683
the Rubens, the Clays, the Clarksons.

380
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,997
It's gonna be a bloodbath. What are they doing?

381
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:26,158
- You smell that smell? 
- Yeah.

382
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:30,377
Taylor left Kirk in charge of the Easter egg hunt, and they didn't exactly find them all.

383
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,768
- They lose the egg map? 
- They didn't make an egg map.

384
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:35,041
- They didn't make an egg map? 
- I was just as shocked.

385
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:36,378
They always make an egg map.

386
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:38,840
- Let's have the hourly report, Joe. 
- Well, you know...

387
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:41,140
- We found three more, Taylor. 
- I said, "Joe."

388
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:45,307
- We found three more, Taylor. 
- That's not good! That is not good!

389
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:50,150
More than half are still missing, and every minute we have people deserting the cause.

390
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,832
- What's this? 
- There's a couple in the tree.

391
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:56,714
- You hid them in a tree? 
- Oh, right.

392
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:58,860
They're completely out of reach of the children.

393
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:02,668
The others I hid for the delight of the children. These I hid for me.

394
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:08,315
Get them down. This is not good. We are losing men, and we are losing...

395
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:09,740
- Hair! 
- Time.

396
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:14,032
- Jinx, jinx, jinx, jinx! 
- Oh, I miss the Caribbean.

397
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:18,552
- So, what are we looking for? 
- Well, we still have no fridge, no stove,

398
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,906
and no microwave, so nothing perishable, nothing that requires boiling water,

399
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:24,973
- and nothing that needs to be cooked. 
- I'm guessing the day-old sushi is out.

400
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:26,835
- It was never in. 
- Beef jerky?

401
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,720
- Definitely. 
- And protein bars.

402
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:31,695
- I'm sorry. When did I win the lottery? 
- Protein bars are a luxury?

403
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:33,758
They are when you live with guys that eat ten of everything

404
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:36,687
when one's the correct portion. Got to keep that proportion cost low.

405
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,075
- Pretzels. 
- Perfect.

406
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:40,788
- And, of course, the perennial Pop-tart. 
- Oh, load up on those.

407
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,614
- Did I tell you that Dean stopped by? 
- Where, Yale?

408
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,490
He was delivering a bookcase for my mom. Hey, you want a bookcase? It's free.

409
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:49,857
I'll take it. So, how's old Dean-boy doing?

410
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,879
- He dropped out of college. 
- What? You're kidding!

411
00:21:51,981 --> 00:21:53,839
Says he needs money. How about marshmallows?

412
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:56,103
Sure, and throw in a Park Avenue mansion while you're at it.

413
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,836
- Another luxury -- got it. 
- So, he's just working full-time?

414
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,154
It's such a waste. Dean is so smart. He can do so much more.

415
00:22:02,383 --> 00:22:04,893
- Hey, melba toast. 
- Cheap, tasteless, and filling.

416
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:05,811
I'll grab a bunch.

417
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,990
And I'll get one bag of marshmallows so the boys can have a treat afterwards.

418
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:12,517
I'm mad at Dean about doing this, but I'm more mad at Lindsay. She's so selfish.

419
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:14,001
- Women. 
- She's his wife.

420
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,018
She should be encouraging him to go to school and think about his future,

421
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,061
but, no, she needs a townhouse and a Rolls-Royce.

422
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:22,556
- They're buying a Rolls-Royce? 
- No, but they are the townhouse,

423
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:25,855
and he didn't even seem that excited about it. It's just Lindsay.

424
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:28,651
I mean, why doesn't she get a job. What does she do all day?

425
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:39,346
So, you think...

426
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,205
you think she heard?

427
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:54,552
- Kirk? 
- That's me.

428
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,094
- You want something? 
- Why?

429
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,321
Well, you usually get something here. You're in the diner.

430
00:22:58,894 --> 00:22:59,600
Oh, yes.

431
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,367
- Kirk? 
- That's me.

432
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:04,261
- You want some coffee? 
- Yes, please.

433
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,693
Your eyes are spinning in different directions.

434
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:08,755
I've been up for one and a half days straight.

435
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,899
I haven't done that since the "Petticoat Junction" marathon in '97.

436
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:14,254
Right. Caught a little of that myself.

437
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:22,115
Luke, turkey sandwich on rye, please -- lettuce, tomato, cucumber.

438
00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:22,876
Coming right up.

439
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:24,474
We're gonna do it, Taylor!

440
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,906
- We're gonna find those last twelve eggs! 
- Cole slaw, too.

441
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:31,187
- Every last one of them! 
- And a pickle -- make it two.

442
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:35,744
Joe and I can divide the square in two and sweep it clean till the job's done.

443
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:39,640
I'm going to pay now and wait outside if you don't mind.

444
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,582
I guess not.

445
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:44,171
I'll take the east side, he'll take the west. That way we can --

446
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:46,639
- That's enough, Kirk! 
- Hey, watch it.

447
00:23:46,746 --> 00:23:50,694
You're not satisfied that I'm suffering for what you've done to this town.

448
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:53,187
You have to continue to personally torture me?

449
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,371
- We'll find the twelve! 
- We won't find the twelve!

450
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,720
You have brought disaster down upon us! Are you happy?!

451
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:03,197
I left you in charge of things because I thought I could trust you,

452
00:24:03,253 --> 00:24:06,781
but you let me down. Now I have to cancel the flower show.

453
00:24:06,842 --> 00:24:09,951
I'm making the call tomorrow. The flower show is history.

454
00:24:10,022 --> 00:24:13,918
- But we're only missing twelve! 
- We have to find every last egg.

455
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:17,758
- Well, then, Joe and I... 
- Joe just left for Cabala class.

456
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:20,023
- I have no men left. 
- You have me left.

457
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:23,457
I have no men left.

458
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:26,498
I've lost my appetite.

459
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,038
Hi, guys. Wow, love the heaters.

460
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:38,510
It's not too cold, is it? We thought we'd start the evening out here.

461
00:24:38,592 --> 00:24:39,345
It's nice.

462
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:42,007
No, no. I'm not seeing the olives that Floyd likes.

463
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:45,089
They're in the back on the right. Is this cart in the best place?

464
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,496
- Move it back? 
- Move it back.

465
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,586
They keep moving everything back and forth -- the cart, the heater, me.

466
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:53,107
- I used to be over there. 
- They're perfectionists.

467
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:54,485
It's like watching an ant farm.

468
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:58,033
Oh! I should go grab that gin that Floyd likes. I've got some in the freezer.

469
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:00,255
Maybe it was better in the other spot.

470
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:02,773
- Patio looks great, Mom, really. 
- I guess.

471
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:06,031
Where's that awful light coming from?

472
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:07,889
I think it's the moon?

473
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:09,820
You're not thinking of having the moon moved, are you, Mom?

474
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,929
I suppose it will move on its own at some point.

475
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:14,534
- You look nice. 
- Thank you.

476
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,738
Why do you look so nice?

477
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:17,631
Because I knew this was an important night for you guys,

478
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,031
I thought I would dress up a little.

479
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:19,936
They're here.

480
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:22,624
Richard, they're here!

481
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:25,721
- You do look especially nice tonight. 
- What is with everyone?

482
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:28,493
It's not like I'm always in dirty sweats fresh from slopping the pigs.

483
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,139
You know what I mean. You don't have that just-came-from-work look about you.

484
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:32,249
A girl can't dress up a little?

485
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:34,922
- Your mom's a little nervous. 
- Ta-ta-ta-da.

486
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,749
Oh, right. You're meeting the parents.

487
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:41,419
I actually had not put that together before. That's why you showered.

488
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:42,506
That's not why I showered.

489
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:43,647
Here we are!

490
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:47,067
Oh, your patio is beautiful, Emily!

491
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:48,076
Thank you, Carol.

492
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:49,265
- Hi, honey. 
- Hi, Mom.

493
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:52,516
- Floyd, Carol, our daughter, Lorelai. 
- How do you do.

494
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,534
And our granddaughter, Rory.

495
00:25:53,713 --> 00:25:57,594
- We've met before, but a long time ago. Hi. 
- We remember you well.

496
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,201
You didn't dress up for our benefit, I hope.

497
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:01,603
No, no. This is nothing weird.

498
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:03,535
How 'bout some beverages, everybody?

499
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:06,780
- Extra dry martini still your drink, Floyd? 
- Absolutely.

500
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:07,702
Same here, Dad.

501
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,533
And bourbon with a splash of branch water, right, Carol?

502
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:12,427
- Thank you, Richard. 
- Oh, here, Emily.

503
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:16,437
- You've redone the patio. It's gorgeous! 
- Don't you think?

504
00:26:16,712 --> 00:26:19,693
Oh, and those trees -- I love them. What are they?

505
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,157
They're African. Come see.

506
00:26:21,802 --> 00:26:24,674
I'm trying to remember when we saw you last.

507
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:29,329
- Ah, probably at camp. 
- Right, the day we came to pick up Jason.

508
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:33,394
There was a talent show. You sang a duet with a pimply fellow.

509
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,118
- "Crater Face" Cutler. 
- He's a litigator now. Very bitter man.

510
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,742
Well, the pimply fellow stank, but you were wonderful -- very charming.

511
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:42,103
- It was from "Grease." 
- How Crater Face got his pimples?

512
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:46,634
No, my song -- "Summer Lovin'." I had to sit on his lap. It was very uncomfortable.

513
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:48,012
Crater Face had very bony knees.

514
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:50,791
And you did a dance with somebody, if I remember correctly.

515
00:26:50,905 --> 00:26:53,649
- Oh, yes, he cha-cha'd. 
- Well, thank you for bringing that up.

516
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:55,343
And thank you for never sending me to camp.

517
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,374
You were great. I liked when you and your partner knocked heads.

518
00:26:58,456 --> 00:27:01,477
"Clubfoot" Cindy -- she married "Crater Face" Cutler. Beautiful children.

519
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:02,732
Here are your drinks everybody.

520
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:07,498
- Rory, we left your soda inside. 
- Oh, I'll go get it.

521
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:11,183
I actually had a barbershop quartet at Yale.

522
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:14,365
I was by far the weakest link. That reminds me.

523
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:18,122
I have a story I've been dying to tell you ever since I heard it, Richard,

524
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:21,553
- about Herb Benson. 
- Oh, what's the rogue up to now?

525
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:23,458
Later. I don't want to bore the others.

526
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:26,248
I can't wait. Help me take the drinks down to the ladies?

527
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:27,859
Absolutely. Excuse us.

528
00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:30,222
Alright, ladies?

529
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:37,446
- Wow, look at that. 
- Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo together again.

530
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:39,956
- Excuse me, Grandma. 
- Yes, sweetie?

531
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,079
Elsa said to say that dinner's in fifteen minutes.

532
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:44,046
Did she ask you to do some vacuuming, too?

533
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:47,528
She sends my granddaughter out to do her job.

534
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,077
How many maids has Emily been through, Richard? We used to keep a running count.

535
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:55,090
No, I'm afraid western mathematical principles cannot accommodate such a task.

536
00:27:55,618 --> 00:27:57,829
My father is in a particularly good mood tonight.

537
00:27:58,025 --> 00:27:58,588
Very.

538
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:01,505
He's only said two passive-aggressive things to me since he got here,

539
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:02,674
which is astounding for him.

540
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:06,304
By the way, may I be the fourteenth person this evening to say how great you look?

541
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:08,157
It's the shower. I gotta try that more often.

542
00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:13,604
Oh, this is our grandson's first step.

543
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:15,591
We were so lucky to have the camera ready.

544
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:19,016
- Oh, that's darling. 
- Oh, ho, ho. He's gonna be big.

545
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:23,078
He's gonna start on the defensive line for the Bulldogs in 2021.

546
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,044
Floyd has it all worked out.

547
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,105
I believe that's you very lovingly holding your nephew,

548
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:29,752
who looks very happy in your arms.

549
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,061
I just told him I'd opened a no-load mutual fund for him. Tracks the S&P.

550
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:34,750
You sentimental fool.

551
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:37,531
You know, I have some terrific pictures of Rory. I should go get them.

552
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,855
- But, Grandma, I'm right here. 
- I know, but you're so big now.

553
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:41,508
Slouch down in your chair for Grandma, honey.

554
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,710
You know, if it's okay, I actually thought I might leave soon.

555
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:45,949
She's got a big paper due next week and lots of reading.

556
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:48,175
Oh, yes, Rory. We've made you stay too long already.

557
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:49,483
Oh, yes, go, go.

558
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:52,163
Thank you for looking like you weren't too bored all evening.

559
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,964
Oh, no, I wasn't, really. It was fun. Bye, Grandma.

560
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,899
- You have to go, too? 
- Oh, no, we came separately.

561
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:58,657
Good.

562
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,346
- Bye, Grandpa. 
- Goodbye, Rory.

563
00:29:00,587 --> 00:29:02,425
- Lovely girl. 
- Oh, she's a doll.

564
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,126
Well, I think this is the perfect time for those who are so inclined to enjoy a cigar.

565
00:29:06,316 --> 00:29:07,472
All right, let's fire 'em up!

566
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,767
I meant the men, but would you like a cigar?

567
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,218
No, you guys go. Circle the fire. Pound your chests. We'll be waiting.

568
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:14,877
- Floyd, Jason. 
- Let's do it.

569
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:17,683
Well, let's let Elsa clean up and maybe keep her job.

570
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:20,043
- The living room all right? 
- We can bring the coffee?

571
00:29:20,145 --> 00:29:21,446
- I was going to pour brandy. 
- Even better.

572
00:29:21,521 --> 00:29:25,629
Oh, let's go. Oh, this evening has been so wonderful, Emily...

573
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:28,208
- The two of us together again. 
- Yes, it has.

574
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:31,162
All those horrible things that happed with the business.

575
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:34,050
Now, let's not let business come between us again.

576
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,703
All that ugliness is in the past now, so we don't have to worry.

577
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:37,707
Yes.

578
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,686
Smooth. '63?

579
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:44,276
'65. You can't get a '63 to save your life.

580
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:45,592
Still does the trick, though.

581
00:29:45,812 --> 00:29:49,867
Oh, good port was as caught up in that ridiculous cigar boom a few years ago, remember?

582
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:51,106
Yes, yes.

583
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:54,567
Amateurs -- babes in diapers talking big in those cigar clubs,

584
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,599
smoking Churchills down to the ring.

585
00:29:56,738 --> 00:30:00,768
Tobacco farmers harvested their crop green just to keep up with the demand.

586
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,680
If I remember correctly, you found a way to rectify the problem.

587
00:30:03,757 --> 00:30:06,727
I couldn't get Hennessy's to put my favorite cigars aside for me --

588
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:09,220
this after twenty years of giving them my business.

589
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:11,668
- Big mistake. 
- Love these kind of stories.

590
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,130
So I bypassed the bastards. I found their supplier.

591
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,686
I swooped in and bought all of my favorites in bulk --

592
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:19,502
hundreds of boxes, cash on the barrel,

593
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:22,344
- so now Hennessy's couldn't get them. 
- Hundreds of boxes?

594
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,375
Oh, I couldn't have smoked them in three lifetimes,

595
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:28,139
so I kindly offered to sell Hennessy's my excess supply.

596
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,011
They leapt at it like dogs for a bone.

597
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,981
And I made enough to pay for the boxes that I kept.

598
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:36,218
You're creative, Richard. It's one of your many strengths.

599
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:37,852
I'd say it's his main strength.

600
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:40,074
Who ever said an insurance man can't be creative?

601
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:42,085
It's one of the fallacies about what we do.

602
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:46,551
People think it's dry, wooden, a bunch of automatons shuffling papers.

603
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,480
On the contrary -- it breeds daily.

604
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:51,820
It's life and death, what we do.

605
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:56,659
It's a new drama every day -- almost Shakespearean.

606
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:58,445
"Richard III," "Macbeth."

607
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:00,989
What day doesn't necessitate courage, tenacity,

608
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:04,456
and sometimes, like your cigar story, Richard, a little vengeance?

609
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:07,374
- And that's all before lunch. 
- Our work is wonderful.

610
00:31:07,886 --> 00:31:09,279
I've always felt that way --

611
00:31:09,694 --> 00:31:12,796
protective of what I do, protective of what I have.

612
00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:15,289
- I think my cigar is out. 
- That's why I'm suing you.

613
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:17,866
- Dad. 
- You're joking.

614
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:20,958
I'm not joking. I'm suing your company.

615
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:24,572
- My lawyers will be contacting you Monday morning. 
- Floyd, you're not serious.

616
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:27,875
Richard, you didn't think I'd let Digger walk away with some of my oldest clients

617
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,583
and not respond, did you? Are you that naive?

618
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,720
Dad, this is crazy.

619
00:31:32,212 --> 00:31:34,919
You signed a noncompete clause with me, Digger.

620
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,327
- And I didn't break that clause. 
- He didn't, Floyd.

621
00:31:37,434 --> 00:31:40,353
I studied Jason's contract, and only certain clients were off limits,

622
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:43,429
- and those remained off limits. 
- Alexander Barnes was off limits.

623
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:46,441
That was a social lunch, and you can't prove otherwise. You have no case.

624
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:49,502
Maybe, maybe not. But by the time the courts figure out the situation,

625
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:53,418
I'll have buried you in legal fees. I know your financial situation, Richard.

626
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:55,722
You can't survive a lengthy legal process.

627
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,402
So, this is just revenge, Floyd?

628
00:31:58,415 --> 00:31:59,762
Are we stooping that low?

629
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:03,490
You just described how strongly you felt about a bunch of cigars.

630
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:06,189
How did you think I was going to feel about my business?

631
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:08,328
How did you know I had lunch with Alex, Dad?

632
00:32:08,687 --> 00:32:10,485
You have a private investigator tailing me?

633
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:13,730
This whole business is so distasteful, but what was I to do?

634
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:17,821
I did what I had to do -- what Richard Gilmore would do.

635
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:21,437
I think I should go now.

636
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:24,139
Don't -- Dad, don't leave. Call this off!

637
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:28,496
Sorry I didn't get to that anecdote, Richard. Maybe some other time.

638
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:30,949
Dad!

639
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:36,888
Rory did come out and she was a beautiful debutante -- the hit of the night.

640
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:40,114
She did so well, we had her go back in and come out again.

641
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:43,231
- Floyd, wait. 
- Dad, I will block the door if I have to.

642
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:46,206
- I wouldn't suggest you do that, son. 
- What is going on?

643
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,644
- I should get my purse. 
- Carol, no.

644
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,409
- Excuse us, Emily. This is rude, but we have to go. 
- Mom, stay.

645
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:54,956
- It's too late, Jason. 
- What's going on? Richard?

646
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:56,575
I apologize, for how this ended.

647
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:59,349
We are not unprepared for a fight. We are capitalized.

648
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:02,411
Only because you put your pension up as collateral on all your loans, Richard.

649
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:05,274
- How did you... 
- It's a small community, our community.

650
00:33:05,427 --> 00:33:08,054
Endangering your pension, Richard -- it's reckless.

651
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:10,301
Which PI did you have on me? Paluso, I assume?

652
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:12,667
He's the best. He gets everything.

653
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:16,568
- It's how I found out your daughter is dating my son. 
- That's not true.

654
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,971
Sorry we spoiled your secret, son.

655
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:29,191
We'll see ourselves out. Come on, Carol.

656
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,183
Dad, wait!

657
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,532
Richard, Emily, this isn't gonna happen, period.

658
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,818
It will resolve quickly and in our favor. Excuse me. Dad!

659
00:33:56,043 --> 00:33:56,986
We need to talk.

660
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,658
You brought your own car, didn't you?

661
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,402
You don't need to stay. You can go.

662
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:12,408
I'm blocked in.

663
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:23,840
Richard, you have every right to be angry.

664
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:28,044
Oh, you're damn right I do. To be humiliated like this in my own house?!

665
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,266
- It was unconscionable. 
- Why didn't you see this coming?

666
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:32,305
You know him, Richard. He doesn't show his hand.

667
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:34,732
He sweet-talked us on the golf course, got himself invited to dinner.

668
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:37,706
- The man is a sociopath! 
- Tell me if you've done anything -- anything illegal.

669
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:40,501
Nothing, Richard, I swear to you -- nothing.

670
00:34:40,598 --> 00:34:42,533
- The lunch with Alex? 
- Social -- we're friends.

671
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:44,485
- Why should I believe you? 
- Because I'm not stupid enough

672
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:47,275
to do anything illegal or think that I could get anything illegal by you.

673
00:34:47,357 --> 00:34:51,110
I do push boundaries, Richard, but I never cross them -- ever.

674
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,112
How long have you been seeing my daughter?

675
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:58,222
- Five months. 
- For five months you've been lying to me.

676
00:34:58,283 --> 00:35:02,256
Yes, but it was a white lie. It was a timing issue.

677
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:05,036
It would have complicated our relationship, yours and mine,

678
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,237
and we didn't know if it would last, so we took a path.

679
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,562
It was the wrong path, and I am sorry about that, too.

680
00:35:10,628 --> 00:35:12,574
- You've got a lot to be sorry about. 
- I do.

681
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:16,162
My damned father.

682
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:21,994
I should have seen this coming. As well as I know him, I keep underestimating him.

683
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:25,265
We both should have seen this coming.

684
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,787
- I can make this go away. 
- How?

685
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:31,483
It's a bluff. You know my father.

686
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:34,615
He hates giving money to lawyers, and this action is gonna cost him big.

687
00:35:34,722 --> 00:35:36,428
- That is true. 
- So we will counter sue.

688
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,275
- It's a wrongful lawsuit. We will make him pay. 
- Possibly.

689
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:43,110
And I will do anything to win back your trust, Richard.

690
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:46,581
You have been so good to me. Please... let me try.

691
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,234
You've got my trust.

692
00:35:53,503 --> 00:35:54,226
Go get him.

693
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:56,544
Thank you, Richard.

694
00:35:57,465 --> 00:36:00,052
Thank you. And also, I'm gonna work on my golf game --

695
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:02,790
get it up to snuff so I stop embarrassing you around the greens.

696
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:04,399
Yeah, do that.

697
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:06,708
Thank you, Richard.

698
00:36:23,497 --> 00:36:27,315
I have a gigantic bottle of vodka at my place -- the largest bottle of vodka known to man.

699
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:28,690
- But what will you drink? 
- Gin.

700
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,451
Let's go.

701
00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:39,271
Eggs.

702
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:43,004
Gotta get the eggs.

703
00:36:47,016 --> 00:36:47,709
Eggs.

704
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:10,345
Flower show's tomorrow. Flower show's tomorrow, and I can't find the last twelve eggs.

705
00:37:10,857 --> 00:37:12,291
I let Taylor down.

706
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:14,657
He's like a father to me.

707
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:17,416
- I think he is my father. 
- He's not your father.

708
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,824
No, my father's my father,

709
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:20,939
which means Taylor's my tailor.

710
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,754
- I wonder how much he charges to hem pants. 
- He's not your tailor.

711
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:26,601
I let him down! I let Taylor down.

712
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:28,783
I let the whole town down.

713
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:31,522
He won't like me anymore.

714
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,329
- What's this? 
- It's the last twelve eggs.

715
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:41,767
- The last... 
- You picked some screwy places to hide them.

716
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:44,034
- Don't do that again. 
- The last twelve?

717
00:37:44,116 --> 00:37:46,236
Tell Taylor you found them. Be the hero.

718
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:50,219
Thank you. Thank you!

719
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:54,572
I love you, Luke Danes! I love you!

720
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:55,913
I'm stupid.

721
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,442
I love you! I love Luke Danes!

722
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:02,257
Love, love!

723
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:15,139
- Hey. Come on. 
- What? Where?

724
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:16,593
I want to talk to you. Come on.

725
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,845
I've been trying to call your cell.

726
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,782
- I didn't have it on. 
- I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry.

727
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:36,039
- About what? 
- I was a jerk at your dorm. I yelled.

728
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:38,365
- You didn't yell. 
- I got upset, and I shouldn't have.

729
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:41,483
No, Dean, I'm the jerk. Hounding you about school like that --

730
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:44,478
it all came out wrong. It's your life. It's your decision.

731
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,124
- No, I shouldn't have sniped like that. 
- I deserved it.

732
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:50,698
- You were concerned. 
- I want the best for you, and I think school is it.

733
00:38:50,877 --> 00:38:55,383
I still think that, but it's not up to me. I just don't want you to settle.

734
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,806
Yeah, I know you don't.

735
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,825
Sometimes it seems like you're the only one who doesn't.

736
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:07,573
I think Lindsay may have overheard me saying stuff at Doose's.

737
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:11,685
I feel even worse about that. I've got such a big mouth.

738
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:12,899
No, it's okay.

739
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,036
- She must have been really upset. 
- Kind of.

740
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:18,761
- I didn't mean to hurt her feelings. 
- She'll be okay.

741
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:21,090
She knows we talk, right -- that we're friends?

742
00:39:22,698 --> 00:39:23,625
She does now.

743
00:39:26,687 --> 00:39:29,010
She doesn't want me talking to you anymore.

744
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:35,314
Well, I guess that's understandable.

745
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:39,655
- I don't want that to happen. 
- I don't want that to happen either.

746
00:39:39,748 --> 00:39:40,885
Then it's not gonna happen.

747
00:39:45,328 --> 00:39:46,209
Should you get home?

748
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:51,060
- Yeah. 
- Me too.

749
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:12,761
Is it true?

750
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:15,573
Did you put your pension up as collateral?

751
00:40:17,954 --> 00:40:18,798
Are we in trouble?

752
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:20,601
It's going to work out, Emily.

753
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:22,397
It'll be okay.

754
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,173
You and Jason talked?

755
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:27,554
It's going to be okay.

756
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:42,171
Three words. Four words. Two words. Okay, you suck at charades.

757
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:45,013
- We're playing charades? 
- Yeah, weren't we?

758
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,585
- You're drunk. 
- You're drunk.

759
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:49,017
- Don't drunk and drive. 
- I would not thunk it.

760
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:50,707
- That's a fun game to play. 
- What?

761
00:40:51,024 --> 00:40:53,330
The "changing words into funny words" game.

762
00:40:54,343 --> 00:40:55,775
Oh, I'm sleepy.

763
00:40:57,149 --> 00:41:00,244
Hey, you know, your father was terrific until the end.

764
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:03,490
Yeah, the end was kind of bad.

765
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:06,619
It's like falling 600 feet to your death.

766
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:10,848
You know, it's fun the first 599 feet, but it's just the last foot -- total sucko.

767
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:13,613
Yeah, it's a bummer -- that last foot.

768
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:15,988
But, you know, there is a bright side to this evening.

769
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:16,844
The moon?

770
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:19,752
No, but the moon was very bright.

771
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:23,863
At least our relationship is out in the open -- no more hiding.

772
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,749
Yeah, no more hiding. I'll drink to that.

773
00:41:26,936 --> 00:41:31,282
And I got Richard calm, and I'll work my magic, which is what I do.

774
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:34,928
Dad's head looked like it was gonna go full-out piñata.

775
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,427
It'll be okay. He and I are going golfing in a couple days.

776
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:38,654
That always puts him a good mood.

777
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:44,876
Your plant is dead. How did it die so quickly?

778
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,985
- It may have been self-inflicted. 
- Poor thing.

779
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,660
Are you okay, though? Am I being enough supportive?

780
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:54,343
- Reversed those last two words. 
- No, I'm fine.

781
00:41:54,728 --> 00:41:57,315
In a weird way, my father trying to destroy me is the first time

782
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:00,717
- I've ever gotten any real respect out of him. 
- Cool. Clink.

783
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:14,450
Nice shot! Beautiful!

784
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:16,457
Your charity is limitless

785
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,914
You're just warming up. You've always been a closer.

786
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:22,063
Too true. So, we're done with the broad strokes?

787
00:42:22,197 --> 00:42:24,686
I believe so. I'll drop the lawsuit.

788
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:26,139
We'll split the clients evenly.

789
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:30,062
You'll come back to the firm -- have your own company under our umbrella.

790
00:42:30,194 --> 00:42:32,687
- And Jason is out. 
- Jason's out.

791
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:36,887
- You'll be returning a hero, Richard. 
- Music to my ears.

792
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:39,830
- Beautiful day today. 
- Beautiful.
