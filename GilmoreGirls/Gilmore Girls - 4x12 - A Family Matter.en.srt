1
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:10,658
Unbelievable.

2
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:19,747
- Hello? 
- There are no empty tables at Luke's.

3
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,355
And I can do what about that?

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,380
Well, I was hoping you'd develop mind control powers since I last saw you

5
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:26,546
- and you could will people to leave. 
- No. If I could do that,

6
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:29,844
I'd be using it to play the ponies or something. Your table would be low on the list.

7
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,774
Selfish! Ooh, hold on a sec.

8
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,903
- Kirk, may I? 
- May you what?

9
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:35,916
- Sit with you? 
- Here?

10
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,421
- Yes. 
- I have a girlfriend.

11
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:40,227
- I'm not flirting with you Kirk. 
- Oh. Then, have a seat.

12
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:41,062
Thanks.

13
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,621
- I love that shirt. 
- It's an Arnold Palmer.

14
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,899
- That was flirting. 
- Oh, man.

15
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,586
- I'm back. So, what's going on with Lane? 
- She's here. She's fine.

16
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:55,571
She's still a little bit in denial. She hasn't talked to her mom since the kick-out.

17
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:57,123
- Poor Mrs. Kim. 
- Poor Mrs. Kim?

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,805
- She kicked Lane out, I'm mad at her. 
- Why? She must be very lonely without Lane.

19
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:05,444
Well, Lane's getting along pretty well here. She kind of fallen into a - rhythm.

20
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,904
- Hey. 
- Hey, Take.

21
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:09,013
Thanks you. Hey, you're out of breath.

22
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:12,806
There were incredibly slow people in the coffee line, and I promised to wake Paris.

23
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:15,443
- Up and at 'em! 
- Die.

24
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:18,850
I got you a triple espresso that I'm going to put here right out of reach,

25
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:22,024
- so sleepyhead has to get up to get it. 
- Die twice.

26
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,425
Was she at the professor's again last night?

27
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:26,108
Yes, but she claims she was up all night cramming.

28
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:29,288
- Well, she was. 
- Oh, ick!

29
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:31,900
Ick what? Are you talking about me? Who is that?

30
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:34,379
It's my mom. We're not talking about you. You're so paranoid.

31
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,129
Uh, hold on a sec. Luke's here.

32
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:40,030
I swear, it feels like these stupid Firelight Festivals happen every week.

33
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:42,339
- And a happy, happy to you too. 
- Order please.

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,067
- Coffee and whatever muffin you have. 
- Comin' up.

35
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:46,666
- You two an item now? 
- I have a girlfriend.

36
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,858
Double dipping, you dog.

37
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,982
You never told me why you're up so early.

38
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:54,410
Well, I've got a quick meeting at the Dragonfly, and then Jason is coming here for the day.

39
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:56,097
- Jason? 
- He's taking the morning off,

40
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:58,815
so I'm taking him shopping for new furniture for his office.

41
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:02,897
- Sounds fun. 
- Yeah. He's never really seen Stars Hollow, so I...

42
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:06,327
- get to - show him around, right? 
- Hm. Um-hm.

43
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:07,627
- Did I interrupt something? 
- No.

44
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:11,298
Would my reminding you of the cell phone policy affect your behavior in anyway?

45
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:13,194
- It's Rory. 
- Hello Rory!

46
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:16,044
- How does it feel to be a step-dad? 
- Knock it off.

47
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,651
- Gooood thinking. 
- What?

48
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:22,195
Clamming up. He's always had a problem with your guys. Best to ease into it.

49
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:24,084
Oh. No, no that's not why I stopped talking.

50
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,647
Whoo, whoo! Good Morning Vietnam!

51
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:28,727
- What was that? 
- Paris.

52
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:31,512
She likes to do this thing in the morning with the triple espresso.

53
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,743
- It's like Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider. 
- Jumping Cattle Hockey!

54
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,683
Hey Paris, can you take this somewhere else, please?

55
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:39,597
Ahh, wait, wait, wait. We got a little something else goin' on here --

56
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:40,620
What's going on?

57
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,127
A kinda odd rock-and-roll, hippy-chick came in, she's deep in conversation with Luke,

58
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:47,646
- who is not looking too happy...
- What are they saying?

59
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:49,473
They are rudely out of range.

60
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:53,815
Hey hun, hun? Try to move in so you can hear 'em. Go

61
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,590
She's joking. We're just friends, ha-ha.

62
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,089
- A mystery woman! 
- Maybe she has something to do with his apartment?

63
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:03,445
I mean he might be leasing out whichever one he's not using, or it's about his divorce with Nicole

64
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:06,446
or the lack of one if the divorce is definitely off.

65
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:11,284
Or maybe she's a friend of Nicole's or another attorney if it's not definitely off.

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,633
Wait, Luke is the most complicated guy I know who also owns a Doobie Brothers record.

67
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,036
- Sweet Mamma Jamma! 
- Oh! I've gotta wake Tanna.

68
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:18,776
Wait, wait… denoument!

69
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:23,542
- He sent her upstairs! 
- Weird!

70
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:26,706
So what do you think? An early morning tryst with the county dominatrix?

71
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,374
- Hmm, does she have a bag? 
- No.

72
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:31,243
Then where would all her dominatrix stuff be?

73
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:33,332
Oh, maybe they're using all the stuff he keeps on hand?

74
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:35,099
- Fishing pole? 
- Nolan Ryan's rookie card?

75
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,762
- Mystery! 
- Mystery!

76
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,288
- Go ask him! 
- Who's yer daddy!

77
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,448
- He's in back. 
- So go back there and ask him!

78
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:41,975
- I have to know what's going on. 
- Okay.

79
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,750
Aww, crap, crap crap!

80
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,230
Oh, maybe later, I don't think now is such a good time.

81
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,712
- I'll talk to you later. 
- Later.

82
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,730
I have a girlfriend!

83
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,173
Okay, open your eyes.

84
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:01,033
Wow! I'm stunning.

85
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,408
- Your stylist concurs. 
- Wow, so organized out here.

86
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:05,936
- I tidied up a little. Excess stuff went into the cabinet. 
- Impressive.

87
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:07,393
I'll get it.

88
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:10,767
- How good do I look? 
- Would a comedic reply crush you?

89
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,116
- Probably. 
- Terrif.

90
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:14,847
- Where's the phone? 
- Buried somewhere.

91
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,773
- Tanna's gonna knock boys out today. 
- With what? Sheer peculiarity?

92
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:20,786
I am hoping that one boy notices. Chester Fleet.

93
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:21,700
Chester Fleet?

94
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:25,482
His father was instrumental in conducting research showing that neurons in the brain fire

95
00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:28,774
actively during REM sleep - with the exception of nerve cells involved

96
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:31,697
with the transmitter chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine.

97
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:35,558
I'd forgot the first part of that sentence by the time you finished, but I say jump him.

98
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:38,590
Thanks Lane. See ya later.

99
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,012
Finally.

100
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:42,911
- Hello? 
- Hi Rory, its Jamie. How you doin'?

101
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:46,305
Good Jamie. It's been a while. How's the second best school in the country?

102
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:49,525
Princeton's fine. Hard, not as easy as slacker schools like Yale.

103
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,785
I'm assuming you're looking for Paris?

104
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:53,812
Yeah. I'm actually in town for a couple of days, so I'll probably see you at some point.

105
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:54,692
Great. Here she is.

106
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:56,930
Hey, I was just stepping out the door, what's up?

107
00:05:57,503 --> 00:05:58,128
Fine.

108
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,186
Your hotel room's good?

109
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:01,775
Good.

110
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,535
Well, probably not tonight, unfortunately. Things are really bad on my end.

111
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:11,696
I know, I'm so sorry but tonight was tentative, remember? Tonight wasn't set in stone.

112
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:16,647
Well, I'm - dead tired, I have tons of studying to do

113
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:18,931
and we have a little drama going on here at the suite.

114
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:21,926
Rory's small town friend, Lane, is crashing in with us.

115
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,773
She got kicked out of her house, and she's in pretty bad shape.

116
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,197
She's pretty heavy into the drugs, totally Nancy Spungening it,

117
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:31,050
chasing the dragon, and I kind of have to be here for support.

118
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:32,401
The chick's bouncing off the walls.

119
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,134
Yeah. Tomorrow, sure, absolutely.

120
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:39,912
Tonight was tentative, Jamie, I'm sure I told you to pencil it in.

121
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:42,268
Pencil. Okay, bye.

122
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:45,975
- What? 
- Nothing.

123
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,738
I had to say something like that. He doesn't always respond to the fact

124
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,633
that I have to study, which I do, you know that.

125
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:52,150
- Oh, sure. 
- And I'm seeing him tomorrow anyway.

126
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:54,156
- What's "chasing the dragon?" 
- I've gotta go

127
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,204
But I don't think you should be saying that...

128
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:03,210
Hey, take it easy!

129
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:47,032
Gentleman, gentlemen. There is no way to one hundred percent avoid liability

130
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:49,264
for on-site accidents at any of your plants.

131
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,757
It is unfortunate, but international accords preclude it.

132
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:54,742
- Can you please translate Mr. Watanabi? 
- Okay.

133
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:59,811
- I'm sorry. 
- What happed to taking the morning off?

134
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:04,061
I have the morning off. Japan does not have the morning off. Here.

135
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:06,339
- Care to join me? 
- With all those Japanese business men in the car? Kinky.

136
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:09,959
Kinky? I'm sorry, what is kinky?

137
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:13,769
You don't have to translate that, Mr. Watanabi. Where are we?

138
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,616
- They must confer. 
- Oh, they really dig conferring.

139
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:20,317
Please tell them that I will call them again tomorrow.

140
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,118
Minna-san domo arigato. Gozaimasu.

141
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,277
Here come on, get in here. It's cold out side.

142
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:30,968
I thought we'd take my Jeep. It holds more stuff.

143
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:31,894
That's good thinking.

144
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,143
- Hello. 
- Hello.

145
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:40,850
- So, where are we off today? 
- Well, I've got a fabulous little list here.

146
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:43,763
Lots of places in neighboring Woodbury and we'll have to get a newspaper.

147
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,324
- For...
- ... finding dead people.

148
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:46,865
Ah, estate sales, got it.

149
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,563
Then we can come back, hit a few places here and then grab some lunch.

150
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:51,935
Do we have time for coffee now? I haven't had any for hours.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,521
- For hours? When did you get up? 
- Five.

152
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:55,850
Wow, they have one of those in the morning too?

153
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:58,615
You know how Asia is not taking the morning off? Neither is Europe.

154
00:08:58,682 --> 00:08:59,627
Well, coffee, it is then.

155
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:02,199
How about you taking me to that place you're always talking about. What is it, um -

156
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:04,678
- Duke's. 
- Duke's. Sure.

157
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,403
Or, uh, we could go some place else.

158
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,293
- Why? Why not Duke's? 
- It's not so special.

159
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,327
You go there daily.

160
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:12,021
Yeah, but I think Duke's is closed… and it's Luke's.

161
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,257
Closed at eight in the morning on a Friday?

162
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:16,238
- Yeah. Sabbath. 
- Duke's a Jew.

163
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:18,774
- No, Luke's a Jew. 
- Sabbath's not 'til sundown.

164
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,749
Well, he likes to get an early jump on his - Sabbathing.

165
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,033
I bet he's open.

166
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:26,243
Okay, but we run the risk of going and then discovering it's closed.

167
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:27,984
Well, I say live dangerously or not at all.

168
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,731
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

169
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:34,523
All the other coffee in town sucks. Let's just go to Duke's - which is Luke's.

170
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,705
- Which is Luke's? 
- Dukes.

171
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:36,915
What?

172
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:41,804
No, no Rietgaard, those documents were Fed-Ex'd to you on Wednesday.

173
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:48,808
The dok-umen-ten were Fed-Ex'd, on

174
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:52,074
aw, shoot, on… Monday is maandag, Tuesday is dinsdag…

175
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,773
- How's your Dutch? 
- Oh great. I just don't like to share it.

176
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:58,894
I'll just have the office fax it all over to you today. It's okay.

177
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,408
Hey, is he ice-skating under a windmill, that's the picture I have in my head.

178
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,897
Okay, Rietgaard, good bye. Bye.

179
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,052
I am exhausted.

180
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,624
Aww, and on your morning off!

181
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:09,522
Yeah, I stink at taking mornings off.

182
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:11,301
Well, here we are.

183
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:12,456
Ahh, wait.

184
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:14,239
No more calls.

185
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:16,103
Whose truck is that?

186
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,849
- Duke's? 
- Yeah, Luke's.

187
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:19,288
- Are they different people? 
- Same person.

188
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:21,679
- And that's his truck. 
- Yes, it's practically an appendage.

189
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:24,213
So, that would be Luke.

190
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:26,614
Boy, you sure like to do a lot of research before getting a cup of coffee.

191
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:28,969
That's the doorknob. It twists to the right. C'mon.

192
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,772
- Ahhh...
- What is with you?

193
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,769
Yeah, I'm not in the mood for coffee anymore.

194
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,611
You were jonesing not 5 minutes ago.

195
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:37,388
No, it's passed. My 5 a.m. coffee just kicked in again.

196
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:39,389
- You drink time-released coffee? 
- It's all the rage.

197
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,552
- Okay. Well, I want coffee. 
- Okay, I'll wait for you here.

198
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,014
What is with you?

199
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:46,864
I was kind of tailgating Duke on the drive in.

200
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:48,420
You were tailgating Luke?

201
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:51,042
- Pretty rudely. There was honking. 
- Aw, geez.

202
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,459
- Well, I didn't know it was Duke. 
- How fast was he going?

203
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:54,887
Snail's speed. Like twenty.

204
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,496
The speed limit here is twelve!

205
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,988
Okay See this is one of the problems I have with small towns - proximity.

206
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:01,329
You tailgate a guy in Manhattan and you never see him again,

207
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:04,128
you tailgate a guy in a small town, he is the keeper of the coffee.

208
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:06,808
- And he is looking at us! 
- Who Luke?

209
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,759
- Is that his name? 
- YES!

210
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:10,556
- Okay, don't look at him! Don't look at him! 
- This is ridiculous!

211
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:12,158
- Okay go, go, go! 
- Where?!

212
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:15,722
- Anywhere - else - for coffee, please. 
- Okay.

213
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,238
Why are we stopping?

214
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,698
Um, the next best place for coffee is at this place.

215
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:23,744
Okay Please find us coffee at least fifty yards away from Duke's.

216
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:27,584
Oh, oh okay finding coffee fifty yards from Luke's is another matter.

217
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:32,055
- Hey Rory. 
- Oh, Jamie, hi.

218
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:33,595
Sorry to pounce on you like that.

219
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:35,230
That's okay, you're not pouncing. Wanna sit?

220
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:36,350
Thanks.

221
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,389
Listen, do you - ?

222
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:42,877
Do I what?

223
00:11:43,154 --> 00:11:47,056
Look, I need to find out what's up with Paris, and I don't know who else to ask.

224
00:11:47,394 --> 00:11:51,377
I mean, I had to rearrange a million things to come here, and I could only manage two days

225
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:52,462
and she won't see me.

226
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,566
Well, you're going to see her tomorrow, aren't you?

227
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,637
- If she doesn't cancel. 
- She's not going to cancel.

228
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:00,075
- She wouldn't. 
- Well, she's been canceling plans for weeks.

229
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:02,688
She's not calling me as much - I know, I sound pathetic.

230
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,807
No you don't, and Paris has been so busy.

231
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,947
You've been a freshman in college, you know what that entails.

232
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:07,843
Yeah.

233
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:10,931
Plus, I heard her telling you about my friend, Lane.

234
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,796
She's been living in our suite and it's been really unfair to all my roommates.

235
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,116
What is "chasing the dragon?"

236
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,230
I don't know, but that's what Lane says she's been doing.

237
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,427
She's in cold turkey now - going it,

238
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:26,653
I mean - cold turkey and -- Paris has been really great helping out.

239
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,391
Has she been seeing someone else?

240
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,248
Not that I know of.

241
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,275
I'll let you go. Thanks, this actually helped.

242
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,480
Good. It will get better, Jamie. I really think that.

243
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,203
Good.

244
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,099
It's my birthday.

245
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,516
Oh wow, happy birthday.

246
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:46,393
Thanks.

247
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:53,744
Thanks.

248
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,426
- Hey! 
- Oh yeah.

249
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,836
- You forget about me? 
- No, I'm just real, real busy, that's all.

250
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,646
- Looks like a lull to me. 
- No, it can be deceptive.

251
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,063
Hey, Kirk, you want another piece of pie?

252
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,103
No, I'm fine.

253
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,559
And this is the commencement of your classic mid-morning lull.

254
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,535
People off to work, kids off to school.

255
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:21,074
You may not have another soul in here for half an hour.

256
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:24,721
It gets peaceful, quiet - kind of like a sweet death.

257
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:26,006
He's trippy.

258
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,598
Kirk, are you sure you don't want anything else?

259
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:30,378
A spider monkey, but there is probably nothing you can do about it.

260
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,499
Cool. C'mon.

261
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:33,741
Coming sis.

262
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,526
Liz?

263
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:41,897
Liz?

264
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,306
I'm in the closet.

265
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:47,929
Oh my God. It's still here.

266
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,722
- What's still there? 
- My pot.

267
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,653
Your what?

268
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:53,880
I used to stash it in a hole back behind Daddy's files

269
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:56,967
cause it was the one place he wouldn't look. Isn't that wild? It's still here.

270
00:13:57,018 --> 00:14:00,762
- Will you give me that. 
- Relax, will ya. I don't do that any more.

271
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,167
- What are you doing? 
- I'm putting it away.

272
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,153
- Throw it in the trash. 
- So the garbage man can see it?

273
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:07,441
- Isn't Hayward Donnelly still the garbage man? 
- Yes.

274
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,790
- Well hell, he sold it to me. 
- I'll get rid of it, okay Liz?

275
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:11,846
Okay, Luke.

276
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,787
Boy, you look good.

277
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:18,589
What about me, don't I look good?

278
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:19,566
You look fine.

279
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:23,104
I do not look fine, I look good. I am good. I am really good, Luke.

280
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,113
Well, I'm glad.

281
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:27,293
- I made us some coffee. 
- I don't drink coffee.

282
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:31,490
Well, sit down and watch me drink it then. Come on, just for a minute.

283
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:37,988
Look at us - catching up, and all.

284
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,004
- I haven't seen you in two years. 
- Three years.

285
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:47,371
- Three years, wow. 
- Liz, I gotta know why you're here.

286
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:48,894
- To see you, I've missed you. 
- C'mon.

287
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,273
I did, plus it's my twentieth high school reunion this Saturday,

288
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:55,919
I thought I'd maybe come back and I'd check out what the rest of the class of 84's up to.

289
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,026
- You're going to your high school reunion? 
- I even sent in a picture for the program.

290
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,380
Wrote a little thing about myself, about how things are going good,

291
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,224
I've got a great job, I've just moved into a really cool apartment with a big patio

292
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:10,547
so I can finally get a dog. Plus, I have got -

293
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:13,302
Wait, wait, wait - let me guess. A new, a new boyfriend!

294
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:13,931
Yes!

295
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:16,599
And this one - Oh, let me guess - is different from the others.

296
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:17,402
Yes, he is.

297
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:19,091
- I dare say, that he might even be the one! 
- Well, yeah!

298
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,908
- C'mon, Liz. 
- You should meet him.

299
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:26,992
Well you know what? As long as, unlike the others, he leaves your TV when he takes off, I'll love him.

300
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:30,750
Okay, fine. You have good reason to think, to doubt -

301
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:35,383
Good reasons? Liz, every time you find the one you wind up with your bank account cleaned out,

302
00:15:35,471 --> 00:15:39,122
your stuff missing, crying on the phone to me to bail you out,

303
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:45,619
which I do happily, but you'll understand if I hold off on planning for the bachelor party for a while.

304
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:47,355
Sure.

305
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:53,442
Well - anyway - let's talk about something else.

306
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,867
Yes. Let's talk about something else. You said you had a new job.

307
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:00,129
Yes, I do. I do. I'm making my own jewelry:

308
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:04,353
beaded necklaces and earrings, some crystal, getting into feathers now.

309
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:04,962
Feathers?

310
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:07,988
I'm really good, very big on the renaissance fair circuit.

311
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:08,588
What's that?

312
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,185
That's where I sell them, the renaissance fair circuit. It's a total trip.

313
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,861
I wear the long skirt, I have a hat and one of those corsets that squishes my boobs all up high.

314
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:20,794
- And I yell "Huzza for the tipper!" 
- And that's your great new job?

315
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:24,767
- You sell earrings at the renaissance fair? 
- I know it sounds flaky -

316
00:16:24,906 --> 00:16:28,008
Oh no, what - huzzah for the tipper with your squished up boobs, not flaky at all.

317
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:31,065
- Look, I have to go back to work. 
- Luke, come on.

318
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:34,598
What come on, Liz? I mean, you're selling earrings in a booth

319
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,818
- and you're hooked up with another winner. 
- You don't even know him.

320
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:39,587
What about your son, huh? What about Jess, you talk to him lately?

321
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:43,332
- You notice he's not even here? 
- Yeah, he sent me a letter. He's with his father.

322
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:44,899
That's it? That's the extent of the contact?

323
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,551
He's nineteen, you can't tell him anything.

324
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,936
- Well, you definitely can't if you don't try. 
- I tried.

325
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,314
No, I tried, you gave up.

326
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:53,675
I thought you'd be better for him that I was.

327
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:55,353
Oh yeah, I was great for him.

328
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,487
I gave him a place to crash while he lied to me about everything,

329
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:01,370
about going to school, about Wal-Mart - you know I stole his car?

330
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:02,526
- You what? 
- In the middle of the night.

331
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,690
I break into his car. I'm stealing it and hiding it in Dad's old garage.

332
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,380
- Why? 
- Why? Because I'm crazy.

333
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:12,132
Because I think now he'll have to go to school, now he'll have to graduate, now -

334
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:19,572
well, we saw how that all turned out, he went to live with the bum who abandoned him -

335
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:21,481
that's how great a job I did.

336
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,042
You tried.

337
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:28,562
Well, I'm great at trying aren't I?

338
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,975
Well, I know you have a lot of work to do, so I'm gonna go.

339
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:39,510
Where you staying?

340
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:40,733
With Carrie Duncan.

341
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,151
Crazy Carrie Duncan?

342
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:45,120
- She's not crazy, she just likes the boys. 
- I'll say.

343
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:48,275
You should talk. You made out with her at the homecoming game.

344
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:54,747
I did not. I didn't not make out with Crazy Carrie Duncan at the homecoming game.

345
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,339
It was really good to see you.

346
00:17:57,122 --> 00:17:58,279
And you do look good.

347
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:02,247
I will make sure Carrie knows that.

348
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:20,517
Wait, wait, wait, wait the tracking says its in Atlanta. What is it doing in Atlanta?

349
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:22,038
Who is this country that speaks English?

350
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:22,933
It's America.

351
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,541
Everyday she learns something new.

352
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:26,845
Okay, Dennis, it is time to get proactive on this.

353
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:29,922
This is when mild mannered Jason Stiles suddenly darted into a phone booth

354
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,143
and ripped off his shirt and became - Proactive Man.

355
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,757
What? I'm sorry I didn't get that last part.

356
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,383
Able to be proactive where ever there is activity of a pro nature.

357
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:37,438
Dennis, just do this.

358
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:41,360
A messenger is coming in an hour to pick up the box with the checks --

359
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:43,700
the box with the checks in the drawer by the floor.

360
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:45,819
The vessel with the pestle holds the brew that is true.

361
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,738
I'm sorry, I'm kind of distracted.

362
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,653
Get off the phone!

363
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,783
It's the last one, I promise - two minutes tops.

364
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:53,351
Two minutes and I'm going to throw that thing in the lake.

365
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:54,888
- There's a lake? 
- We just drove by the lake.

366
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:56,551
Aw, I missed the lake, can we drive by it again later?

367
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:57,912
Two minutes!

368
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:14,352
My deliveryman is very good, very dependable. He will call you with a two hour window.

369
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:16,027
- Let me check his availability. 
- Thank you

370
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:18,214
- Hi Mrs. Kim. Hi. 
- Lorelai.

371
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,185
Wow, you've got a lot of new stuff in here.

372
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:28,685
She's fine. She's at Yale with Rory.

373
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:31,573
Here it is.

374
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,980
Let's see, we have Monday between one and three open.

375
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:36,780
Great.

376
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:41,893
No, no, no. I don't see any reason why that can't work out.

377
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:46,376
Okay! Ah, I'm sorry but your two minutes are up. Asia, Africa and where ever Jvork is from

378
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:49,568
is just going to have to wait because I'm putting a kibosh on that phone.

379
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:52,165
I'm sorry mister but I'm clicking that thing off myself.

380
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:54,438
No, no, no. I am still here, Emily!

381
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:58,370
There's just a lot of commotion around me.

382
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:02,052
No, I'm not in the office. I took the morning off.

383
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:06,137
Yes, Richard deserves a morning off too.

384
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:10,726
Okay, I'll see you at the hotel. Okay, bye.

385
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:14,355
I pulled a muscle waving at you.

386
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:16,408
How was I supposed to know you were talking to my mother?

387
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,427
It was a very personal wave. It was a big, broad, over the top personal wave.

388
00:20:20,488 --> 00:20:21,774
- She called you? 
- She called.

389
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,427
Are you doing like a Mrs. Robinson thing with my mother?

390
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:28,143
Yes. I was visiting Richard one day, and he stepped out and Emily lit a cigarette

391
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:31,358
- and did that triangle thing with her thigh. 
- Well, you said hotel.

392
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:35,357
Well, she wants me to come to some charity thing at a hotel tomorrow.

393
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:39,611
Hey, wait, wait a minute. If I can't be on the phone then you cannot be on the phon..

394
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:40,134
Hello?

395
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:42,857
- Lorelai, its me. 
- Lorelai Gilmore's a hypocrite!

396
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:45,040
- Hello Emily! 
- Why are you calling me Emily?

397
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,059
'Cause that's your name, ask me again and I tell you the same.

398
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:50,322
- And who was that yelling? 
- No one you'd know. What's up?

399
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:53,903
Well, I'm having trouble filling these eight seats your father bought

400
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:57,399
for the rare manuscript acquisition charity dinner tomorrow night.

401
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,746
This is Jason. Oops.

402
00:20:58,838 --> 00:21:00,870
That's the same man I heard before. Is he harassing you?

403
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:05,627
Ah, err, yes. I'm on the street. Get away you! It's just insanity out here today.

404
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:08,168
Well, that's not good. Walk down a different street.

405
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,553
I'm turning the corner as we speak. So, what, there's a manuscript thing?

406
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:14,684
Yes, it's a fund-raiser, and we're stuck and I'm desperate for attendees.

407
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:16,732
- I'll go. Sure. Yes. 
- Really?

408
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,688
I'll be there. How much - how much do I give?

409
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:20,015
Nothing. We've already paid.

410
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:23,312
Okay, why don't you leave the details on where to meet up and all on the home machine.

411
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:26,640
I will, thank you, and please get out of the street.

412
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:27,689
I will, bye.

413
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,461
Okay, okay, bye. Did she hear me?

414
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:32,241
Yes, but she thinks you're a raving street loon.

415
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:35,359
Okay, this is exactly the reason why I hate hiding relationships

416
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:36,916
- I know. 
- We're gonna get caught.

417
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:39,240
- We can't tell them. 
- We're gonna get caught.

418
00:21:39,316 --> 00:21:41,985
- This is just a freak occurrence. 
- This is destined to be repeated.

419
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,454
They'll be mad that I hid it.

420
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,631
They'll be madder the longer you hide it.

421
00:21:45,732 --> 00:21:48,344
They'll screw things up, I don't want that. I like us.

422
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:49,512
But, it's inevitable.

423
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:54,814
They're gonna see us together someplace, or a traffic report will take pictures of cars on the expressway

424
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:58,006
and we'll be sitting in the car - and then Richard will be watching the news and he will see us,

425
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,851
so barring some sort of Star Trek-like cloaking device -

426
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:04,477
which was problematic in every incarnation of Star Trek -

427
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,293
I remember Kirk complaining about it, I remember Picard complaining about it -

428
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:09,532
they will see us, and we'll get caught.

429
00:22:09,643 --> 00:22:11,425
I'm very uncomfortable dating a Trekkie.

430
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:15,670
Ah, I just don't feel good about this. It makes me very nervous.

431
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:18,916
Listen, I've a very difficult phone call this morning with our Japanese partners

432
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:23,463
and I didn't ever break a sweat, I had that testy call from the client from California -

433
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:27,563
not a drop, but your mother calls and I'm soaked through.

434
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:30,344
- On your morning off too, I'm sorry. 
- That's okay.

435
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,840
Do you want me to wring your shirt out for you?

436
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,241
No, it's old - and I like us too,

437
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:37,180
by the way which is why I feel so strongly about this.

438
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:38,695
- I know. 
- I'm not mad.

439
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:39,622
I know that too.

440
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:41,648
And I'll do what ever you want, you know them better than I.

441
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:43,574
I'll tell them.

442
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:45,618
- Really? 
- Yes. Yes.

443
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:50,973
Tonight's our Friday night dinner. Dad's gone, but starting with Emily might be for the best.

444
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,400
I could talk to Richard, if you want.

445
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:54,530
Oh no, its my thing. I'll do it.

446
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,707
Good. Oh, look phone is off.

447
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,139
Oh. Good, let's go buy some furniture.

448
00:23:06,726 --> 00:23:08,780
So, you're just sitting here watching TV?

449
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:12,006
I'm studying. Look at Ted Kennedy, huh?

450
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:14,556
I always admired him as a senator, but you see him and think:

451
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:17,378
It's just so unfair that fat men look good in suits.

452
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:20,156
We girls get a couple of pounds and every piece of fashion betrays…

453
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:21,247
- Off. 
- What?

454
00:23:21,422 --> 00:23:23,669
I want to talk to you about your boyfriend situation, Paris.

455
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,366
- Jamie? 
- I'm sorry, I should have clarified "boyfriends."

456
00:23:25,543 --> 00:23:27,139
Oh. You mean a certain other fella.

457
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:30,909
Let's cut the coyness. I want to talk about you having an affair with Professor Asher Fleming

458
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:35,030
and at the same time stringing along poor Jamie, with no concern for his feelings.

459
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:35,886
It's not an affair.

460
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,541
Affair. Relationship. Fling. Tete-a-tete. What ever you want to call it.

461
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:41,726
- Well, I'm very surprised by this. 
- How so?

462
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:43,519
You've never wanted to discuss Asher before.

463
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:46,495
Well, I don't particularly want to discuss him now, but I'm forced to.

464
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:48,205
- What's forcing you... 
- I just ran into Jamie,

465
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:52,786
and he's wandering around lonely, missing you, scared of losing you,

466
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,369
and you're sitting here watching C-SPAN!

467
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:56,693
Nobody watches C-SPAN. It's just on in the background.

468
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,340
Well you gotta choose Paris, because this is becoming pretty clear

469
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:02,125
that the what-ever-you-want-to-call-it with the professor is not a short-lived thing.

470
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:04,707
I'd say that's accurate, and you can just call him Asher.

471
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:07,785
No, he's my teacher, so I think I'll stick with professor.

472
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,815
- Professor just makes him sound old. 
- He IS old!

473
00:24:09,897 --> 00:24:14,588
He's sixty. Today's sixty is what fifty was twenty years ago and he's got the body of a forty year old.

474
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:16,441
I really don't want to talk about his body.

475
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:18,987
I'm not denying that we've got a May-December romance going on here.

476
00:24:19,062 --> 00:24:23,410
This is not May-December, this is May - Ming Dynasty.

477
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:25,162
An age difference like this is very common.

478
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:27,643
People dating people the same age are passe now.

479
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:31,535
My grandfather introduced you to him. Do you see how awkward this is for me?

480
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,480
Well, hot men tend to run in packs.

481
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:35,810
Do not ever say anything like that again.

482
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,055
Mary, you are such a prude.

483
00:24:37,173 --> 00:24:40,684
Well, at least I'm not mean to people who love me. Where is your heart?

484
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:44,454
I know I've mishandled the Jamie situation. He just can't take a hint.

485
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:48,211
Well, you gotta do something, because one of us here does care about Jamie and I think its me.

486
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,433
I know. He's my first real boyfriend.

487
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,658
Well, you got lucky with him.

488
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,238
And he's crazy about me, I never quite figured out why.

489
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,455
Oh, don't get so self-deprecating. It's obnoxious.

490
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:59,215
He's been so forgiving. I've been pretty mean.

491
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:01,317
Just talk to him and see how it goes.

492
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:06,490
Hey, it's me. We've got to end this - now.

493
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:10,519
There's just no reason to prolong it. Sorry you came all the way out here.

494
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:14,672
Well, Rory show me the light. She made me see there's just no point in going on.

495
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,445
Paris!

496
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:18,296
No, she just came home and we talked. She's right here if you want to ask her, yourself.

497
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:19,438
Do not give me that phone!

498
00:25:19,526 --> 00:25:23,166
Anyhow, I'm really sorry Jamie. Really. Bye.

499
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:26,985
That had all the tact of a Nazi storm trooper.

500
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,197
- It was your idea. 
- Breaking up was not my idea.

501
00:25:29,253 --> 00:25:31,193
Well, he'd be stupid if he thought that's why I'd do it.

502
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:35,725
This was good. It was right. I'm glad I did it.

503
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:37,636
You can have the TV if you want.

504
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,770
Hello Luke. It's getting cold again isn't it?

505
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,151
Yup, it's that unpredictable time of year, Mrs. Cassini.

506
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:50,026
- Stay warm. 
- Yeah, you too.

507
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:13,624
It's a Rambler Ambassador, four door, a rusty brown pretty much a beat-up clunker.

508
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:17,572
No. I don't know how long its been missing.

509
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:21,648
I mean I saw it for sure last week.

510
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:26,374
Nah, I don't drive it much, it's a second car, okay?

511
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:32,406
Just, just call me when you find it. Thanks, Bye.

512
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,783
- Oh hey. 
- Hey.

513
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:39,881
Tanna just told me that that Chester Fleet guy liked her hair and asked her out.

514
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:40,858
She's throwing up now.

515
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:41,681
Good for her.

516
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:43,132
Going somewhere?

517
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,335
Home for the weekend.

518
00:26:44,755 --> 00:26:45,758
Just to get away from me?

519
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:48,994
No, I've got dinner at my grandma's tonight - obligatory thing -

520
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,055
and our town's having its Firelight Festival tomorrow which I haven't missed since I was one,

521
00:26:53,222 --> 00:26:57,754
so not seeing you is - Well - quite frankly just a fringe benefit.

522
00:26:58,174 --> 00:27:00,259
Would it make you feel any better to know how awful I feel?

523
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:01,124
Nope.

524
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:03,028
I don't understand why you're so upset about this.

525
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:03,909
I know you don't.

526
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,839
 I tried to call Jamie again, he won't pick up.

527
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,706
- Can you blame him? 
- No. I know I let it go too long.

528
00:27:08,814 --> 00:27:12,711
I just wasn't sure what Asher was thinking at first. I wasn't sure if it was just a fling for him.

529
00:27:12,822 --> 00:27:16,073
But over the past couple of weeks, he's been mentioning stuff about the future.

530
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,233
He's spending a month teaching a couple of courses at Oxford over the summer

531
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,496
and then he asked me what I was planning to do over the summer.

532
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:25,587
I mean there is a definite implication that he was wondering if I was available during the summer.

533
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,203
I think he might ask me to go with him to Oxford. I mean, why else would he ask?

534
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:31,024
- Beats me. 
- I'm not counting my chickens…

535
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:32,811
- Its good thinking. 
- But it is the first indication.

536
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,735
- Look, I've gotta hit the road. 
- It was his accent that did it.

537
00:27:35,914 --> 00:27:39,682
I'm such the total Anglophile. When I was a kid, I was in love with Neal Kinnock.

538
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:41,306
- Who? 
- The former head of the Labour party.

539
00:27:41,357 --> 00:27:44,864
Teeth like a horse, but oh that voice, and then there was Roger Moore -

540
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:47,332
- English accents are nice. 
- He TiVos Frontline.

541
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:48,531
- Who does? 
- Asher.

542
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,338
- So we can watch it together. 
- Terrific.

543
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:52,074
You don't think he meant we'd be together this summer?

544
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,378
- I wasn't there. 
- I'm not counting my chickens.

545
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,625
- I think that's smart. 
- I never wanted to hurt Jamie.

546
00:27:57,393 --> 00:28:00,844
I just don't know how to do these things. I'm not very nice sometimes.

547
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:03,302
I hope Asher doesn't see that in me.

548
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,648
I didn't mean to hold you up. Have a good weekend.

549
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:11,714
I just want you to be happy. You know that, right?

550
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:14,012
Thanks. I'm happy.

551
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:27,103
Mom? Hello?

552
00:28:31,431 --> 00:28:34,237
Oh, Rory. Good. I did not go suddenly half deaf.

553
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,756
- Were you supposed to meet me here? 
- No, I'm a surprise.

554
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:38,871
- As was your conception. 
- I'll just be two minutes.

555
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:40,160
As was your conception.

556
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:43,407
- Hey, how was your day with Jason? 
- Fun! He makes me laugh.

557
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:44,548
Aww, I like that

558
00:28:44,753 --> 00:28:49,314
He's very off-center. It's been a while since I've been with someone off-center.

559
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:49,975
Cool.

560
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:53,038
I'm telling Mom tonight - about us.

561
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:55,265
I think Grandma knows you're my mother.

562
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:56,816
About me and Jason.

563
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,603
- Very brave. 
- Yeah.

564
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:01,020
Jason's wanted to from the beginning.

565
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,624
It's the mature thing to do and that's why I didn't want to do it, but it's time.

566
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:05,408
That's weird

567
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:06,314
What's weird?

568
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,434
This.

569
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:08,408
Bread? Bread is weird?

570
00:29:08,474 --> 00:29:10,680
It's weird when its here. It does not make a good snack.

571
00:29:10,881 --> 00:29:13,164
It does when you add stuff to it, like cheese.

572
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:13,861
We have cheese?

573
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:16,713
Yeah. It's not "Donner Pass", we have cheese.

574
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:19,359
Whoa! It's like a frickin' cornucopia.

575
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,121
- Yeah, there's the stuff. 
- There's the cheese!

576
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,184
Yeah, yeah. Why are you making such a big deal about this?

577
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:26,394
Because we never had real food in this house the whole time I was growing up.

578
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:29,052
What? We always had food. This fridge was never empty.

579
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:32,493
Well, yeah. We had left overs from take-out - cold pizza, Luke's fries,

580
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:35,627
- but never stuff you had to assemble. 
- Okay chill out on the inquiry.

581
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:36,511
Is that a cucumber?

582
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,722
Listen, you'd make a terrible private investigator, because you get hung up

583
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:43,254
on all sorts of dumb stuff that does not matter - now come on. We're late, I'll drive.

584
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:45,519
Sounds good. Oh my God, is that a tomato?

585
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:46,132
Enough already.

586
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:53,049
Ah, my girls are arriving together.

587
00:29:53,116 --> 00:29:54,177
- Hi, Mom. 
- Hi, Grandma.

588
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,455
- You smell like coffee. 
- We haven't had any.

589
00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:58,681
It's so strong.

590
00:29:58,749 --> 00:30:00,397
Okay, Mom. I really don't like you sniffing me.

591
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:01,605
Hey where's Grandpa tonight?

592
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:04,728
He's in Manhattan having dinner with clients. He just called.

593
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:07,151
They're at some restaurant near Times Square.

594
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:09,956
He said that Times Square just keeps getting cleaner and cleaner.

595
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,589
They didn't stumble upon one prostitute the whole night.

596
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:15,374
Oh yeah. I heard the Disney Company had them all killed.

597
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,926
What I don't understand is why Jason wouldn't make this trip instead.

598
00:30:18,994 --> 00:30:21,753
Oh. Well, he's maybe busy with his own thing.

599
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:24,844
I know for a fact he wasn't. Richard said he took the whole morning off.

600
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,892
Well, everyone deserves an occasional morning off.

601
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:28,388
Richard never takes a morning off.

602
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:32,152
He's up every day at five-thirty on the phone then it's out the door to the office.

603
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,446
I bet Jason doesn't roll out of bed until eight.

604
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:38,260
On the contrary - he - probably gets up earlier than eight.

605
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:40,477
You know, I would think that he would have to, to keep up with Dad.

606
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:42,055
- Makes sense. 
- Just a guess.

607
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:45,822
I just find that boy so irritating. He's always trying to get in good with me.

608
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:51,210
Complimenting me, agreeing with me. He's absolutely prostrating himself at my feet. It's so weak.

609
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,108
Well you're a formidable opponent, Mom. They don't call you the Edie Amine of the DAR for nothing.

610
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,906
He's so grating about it. I'm never fully comfortable around him.

611
00:30:57,988 --> 00:30:59,442
Well you should maybe try harder.

612
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:03,819
I try. But every time I see him a new facet of his Jason-ish comes out.

613
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:07,547
It's good to have different facets, and there's probably a lot you don't know about him.

614
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:11,008
Oh, I'm sure about that. You two would be perfect for each other.

615
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:14,039
What? Who, me and Jason?

616
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:16,113
- A match made in heaven. 
- Well, thanks a lot!

617
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,219
Don't get upset.

618
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,990
Well Mom, you just spent the last five minutes listing every off-putting quality Jason has,

619
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:25,094
real or imagined and then you put me on his level and you say we're perfect together.

620
00:31:27,806 --> 00:31:29,194
What's so funny?

621
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:31,827
I'm sorry -

622
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:36,496
Did I miss something? Did a clown come in behind me and start doing funny pratfalls, what?

623
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:42,102
Just the idea of you and Jason together, it's funny.

624
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:43,351
It's funny.

625
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:47,145
It's very funny. I just said it as a joke.

626
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:51,098
- You said it as a joke. 
- You took it so seriously.

627
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,847
- But why is it so funny? 
- Well, think about it.

628
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:56,336
I am. I just trying to figure out what you're thinking.

629
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,867
Well, it's obvious.

630
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,006
It's not obvious to me or to Rory. Rory's wondering, aren't you?

631
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:05,370
- Yeah, why is that so funny, Grandma? 
- It would just be so ludicrous.

632
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:10,058
But why, because he's a - you know, he's a hard-working guy from what I know.

633
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:15,941
I'm sorry, you're making me laugh even harder about it. I just said it off hand.

634
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:17,630
I know.

635
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:18,726
Martini?

636
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:21,281
You didn't have to shake it much with all that laughing, you know,

637
00:32:21,343 --> 00:32:23,195
the laughing just shook it on up for ya.

638
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:26,354
It's good to laugh like that once in a while.

639
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:27,932
Oh yeah. I know.

640
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,263
You okay?

641
00:32:39,718 --> 00:32:40,486
You didn't tell her.

642
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:42,868
Next time?

643
00:32:44,424 --> 00:32:46,394
How are your motor skills? I'll drive.

644
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,163
- Luke. 
- Oh, Hey Coop.

645
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:55,272
Good news, found the car.

646
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,249
Oh good. Who would steal that thing. It's just a hunk of junk.

647
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:00,940
It broke down on the expressway a couple of hours ago, the guy was in it.

648
00:33:01,432 --> 00:33:02,236
You got the guy?

649
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,325
Yeah, but there's not a lot we can do, the guy's the owner.

650
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:05,640
What do you mean? I'm the owner.

651
00:33:05,728 --> 00:33:08,298
Well, not according to the registration. It's registered to a --

652
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:09,409
Jess Mariano.

653
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,915
Yep. Says you're his uncle.

654
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:15,230
Registration's long expired, too. It needs seeing to.

655
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,606
But I just figured that since these seems like a family matter,

656
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:19,484
I'd bring the car and the kid back to you.

657
00:33:23,274 --> 00:33:24,698
Yeah, a family matter.

658
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,526
- Where do you want it? 
- Right there's fine.

659
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:30,586
This isn't wasn't my idea.

660
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:31,953
You'll take care of the registration?

661
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,740
- Yeah, thanks Coop. 
- Yeah, thanks Coop.

662
00:33:33,856 --> 00:33:34,758
Lets go, Frank.

663
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:39,162
Well, look who's back.

664
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:40,928
I'm only here to retrieve my property.

665
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:42,638
- You've got a lot of nerve. 
- You've got a lot of nerve.

666
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:44,185
- How so? 
- You stole my car.

667
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,795
Coop should have arrested you, why didn't he arrest you?

668
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:47,727
Free donuts.

669
00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:48,807
Beautiful.

670
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:50,835
So you got anything you wanna say?

671
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,599
You could have washed it once in a while?

672
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:58,306
Okay fine, the car is yours, our business here is done, hasta la vista, have a nice life.

673
00:33:58,382 --> 00:34:01,008
Our business here is not done. My car is wrecked because of you.

674
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,551
Oh yeah?

675
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:05,377
Three of the tires are leaking, its got no oil, the floats in the carburetor are probably cracked

676
00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:08,955
so it's back-firing like mad, I mean, people were ducking when I was driving by.

677
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,854
Then it stalled and wouldn't start.

678
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:14,648
Well, you can find Mr. Goodwrench in the Yellow Pages, I think it's under M or is it G?

679
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:17,051
I can never tell with those kinds of things.

680
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:19,405
- You're paying for the repairs. 
- Oh, don't make me laugh.

681
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:20,845
It's broken because of you.

682
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:23,819
That thing was a piece of junk to begin with, the paint is the only thing holding it together.

683
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,470
And the expired registration? I'm gonna have to pay a fine.

684
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:28,602
So, I guess it didn't work out with your dad, huh?

685
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:29,990
It worked out fine.

686
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,083
So, what are you doing back East, buddy? Still searching?

687
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:32,912
Been traveling.

688
00:34:33,034 --> 00:34:36,257
Well, thanks for all the swell cards and letters you sent while you were away.

689
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:38,718
You kicked me out, what were you expecting - a candygram?

690
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,833
I didn't kick you out, you got yourself kicked out.

691
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:42,983
Nice spin, you should work for Bush.

692
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,092
So what did you get out of this Kerouac trip of yours?

693
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,617
You write the great American novel or something? You learn how to play the harmonica?

694
00:34:47,674 --> 00:34:49,311
What do you care, you're not my guardian anymore.

695
00:34:49,373 --> 00:34:50,996
And I bless every day that I'm not.

696
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,387
Well, when you're not good at something, it's best to cut and run.

697
00:34:53,454 --> 00:34:55,988
Aww, I'm sorry I tried to give you a decent life, Jess.

698
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,263
I'm sorry I didn't think driving a fork-lift for the rest of your life was good enough for you.

699
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:04,021
Oh that is condescending, isn't it? I thought you were a friend of the working man.

700
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:07,676
Oh, that sister of mine, what a prize. What a prize.

701
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,044
What does she have to do with any of this?

702
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:12,224
I tell her about the car, she runs and tells you. That's what happened, right?

703
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,001
Her claiming she had no contact.

704
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:18,808
Again, the car is mine. Liz was doing the right thing, that's what family does.

705
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:21,357
Family? What a joke coming from you.

706
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,467
- Go clean your counters, I'm tired. 
- So, you staying in town?

707
00:35:24,594 --> 00:35:27,231
I don't know of any twenty-four hour auto shops around here, do you?

708
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:29,383
- Well, you're not staying with me. 
- It didn't cross my mind.

709
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,533
Get it fixed quick.

710
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:32,729
Believe me, no one wants it fixed faster than me.

711
00:35:33,103 --> 00:35:34,987
You stay away from her while you're here.

712
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,574
- Stay away from who? 
- You know who I mean.

713
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:39,165
Gee, you're so cryptic.

714
00:35:39,243 --> 00:35:41,418
You've done all the damage there you're gonna, okay?

715
00:35:41,624 --> 00:35:43,691
I'm here to get my car, then I'm gone.

716
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,873
- Where are you staying? 
- Backseat's as comfy as anywhere.

717
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,553
Fine.

718
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,296
Please do not say that word again.

719
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:01,223
It's a free country.

720
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:03,843
Just say hot chocolate or say nothing at all.

721
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:05,539
Mmm, terrific "Ho-Cho".

722
00:36:05,636 --> 00:36:08,180
Oooh, I hate that. It's so cutsey-wootsey.

723
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:09,773
Do you hate it as much as my favorite summer treat?

724
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:11,426
- Don't! 
- An ice-cold Fro-Yo!

725
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:13,746
Stop! Just stop - who are you calling?

726
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:15,876
I'm calling Jason, I promised I would check in.

727
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:21,299
- Hello. 
- I'm dying here, how'd it go?

728
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,589
Well, it didn't.

729
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:24,508
Sorry.

730
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:25,369
You chicken out?

731
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:28,635
Na - it's a long story - the timing was very bad.

732
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:31,563
- You chickened out. 
- No, no. I - ah, yeah - kind of.

733
00:36:31,615 --> 00:36:34,493
- Lorelai, we've got to do it. 
- Well, the timing has to be right

734
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:37,308
It's going to be awkward no matter when you do it.

735
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:38,548
Not if they're both unconscious.

736
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:41,015
Yeah, but then you're going to be dealing with why both your parents are unconscious,

737
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:45,117
and doctors consultations, and phoning friends and relatives - the timing is bad there too.

738
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:48,926
Listen, it's ah - trust me, this was not good timing,

739
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:51,931
and I swear to you there'll be much better timing in the near future.

740
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:56,233
Well, near is near - I can't define it more than that.

741
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,500
Uh, it's closer than far, how's that?

742
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:03,651
I don't believe this.

743
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:09,037
Uh, honey - I gotta call you back, okay? Bye. Um, is that - ?

744
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:10,465
- Yes. 
- Oh.

745
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:12,089
I don't believe this.

746
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:15,029
- What is he doing here? 
- What is he doing - there?

747
00:37:15,095 --> 00:37:17,091
Asleep in his car - is he living in it?

748
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:18,080
I don't see stuff.

749
00:37:18,397 --> 00:37:20,026
Does Luke know he's here?

750
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,212
Well, I know what you know.

751
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:24,409
He - may not know.

752
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:27,568
Well, it's right in front of his place. How could he not know?

753
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:30,019
Well, it's freezing out here. He could die, he must not know.

754
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:30,971
Or doesn't care.

755
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,631
Do you think David Blain put him up to this?

756
00:37:32,763 --> 00:37:34,745
Why is he here? I mean, why did he come back?

757
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:37,571
Light's still on in there, Luke's in there somewhere - should we go talk to him?

758
00:37:37,653 --> 00:37:41,965
No. It's too weird. And it's - weird.

759
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,101
Definitely weird.

760
00:37:43,255 --> 00:37:44,391
Well, I'll just see you at home.

761
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:47,336
I'm - cause I don't want to deal with this. I'll see you at home.

762
00:37:56,798 --> 00:37:57,622
Hey, come on in.

763
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,674
Are you aware of whose out there?

764
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:00,509
Yeah, I'm aware

765
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:02,264
- That he's sleeping in his car? 
- Yeah.

766
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:05,199
- It's about thirty-five degrees. 
- He's a tough guy, he can take it.

767
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:07,011
Luke, why is he back here?

768
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:08,750
- Because I'm stupid. 
- Meaning?

769
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:12,455
Well his mom showed up -- for what reason I don't know --

770
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:15,707
I'm still waiting for that shoe to drop. I mention Jess' car

771
00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:17,242
and then - boom - there's Jess.

772
00:38:17,513 --> 00:38:20,498
So the mystery woman from this morning? That's Liz?

773
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,824
In all her glory.

774
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:23,600
Quite a day you've had.

775
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:25,106
Oh, it's been delightful.

776
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:30,252
I think Bobby McFerrin's gonna write one of those happy boop-boopdy-doo songs of his about this.

777
00:38:30,312 --> 00:38:33,626
I mean, she lied to me about having contact with Jess, so she's lied about everything else.

778
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:35,391
But why is he sleeping in his car?

779
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:39,074
Because he's going to wait to have it fixed, it's a point of pride with the little punk.

780
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:42,467
But please, don't tell Rory, he'll be gone tomorrow, no reason to upset her.

781
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:44,721
- Well, she's already seen him. 
- Oh man!

782
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,241
She's fine Luke. She's over it.

783
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,209
Well, he won't go near her, I'll make sure of that.

784
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,501
Again, I don't think it's necessary. She can fend for herself.

785
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:53,964
- What a lie it all is! 
- All what is?

786
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:56,958
Families. I mean, they're just messes.

787
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:01,567
It's like this - spilled drink that just keeps spilling, and ya gotta keep cleaning it up,

788
00:39:01,654 --> 00:39:04,474
and you scrub and you scrub and you just can't get the stain up!

789
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:07,408
Show me a happy family - just one.

790
00:39:07,485 --> 00:39:09,763
Didn't that Tolstoy-guy say something about families?

791
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,161
- Probably 
- It's a famous thing he said.

792
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:15,799
It's like: "all families are unhappy" …or, or, or "happy on the surface"…

793
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:19,252
- or "unhappy in the same way"… 
- Sounds a little incomplete.

794
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:22,753
Well, y'know, maybe he couldn't complete the thought because he was dealing with his stinkin' family.

795
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,744
Do the Hallmark people know about you? 'Cause you're a natural.

796
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:30,217
I'm tired of cleaning up messes. I'm tired of helping people who do nothing to help themselves!

797
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:31,267
I'm sorry you're so upset.

798
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:35,930
I just don't want you to have to deal with the frozen carcass in the morning

799
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:37,298
- He'll be fine. 
- Okay.

800
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:43,187
Try to get some rest, okay? Relax. Watch a little TV - no family shows…

801
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,361
Yeah, yeah… I'm going up now.

802
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:48,215
Bye.

803
00:39:58,143 --> 00:39:59,024
- Hey. 
- Hey.

804
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:02,613
So, do you want an update?

805
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:03,822
I guess.

806
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:06,407
Well, the whole thing -

807
00:40:07,744 --> 00:40:10,068
the mystery woman from this morning? Jess' mom.

808
00:40:10,263 --> 00:40:10,913
Whoa.

809
00:40:11,353 --> 00:40:14,455
Still a mystery though. Luke's not quite sure what she's up to.

810
00:40:14,558 --> 00:40:15,423
She came with Jess?

811
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:17,902
She called him or something. It's very confusing.

812
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:20,165
Luke was not in an expansive story telling mood.

813
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:23,949
All he knows is that Jess said he came for his car and he's not leaving without it.

814
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:25,228
- Okay. 
- Yeah.

815
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:29,227
Which means he might be here part of the day tomorrow, so uh, "Danger, Will Robinson."

816
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:30,476
I can live with it, really.

817
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:32,315
- That's what I told Luke. 
- Good.

818
00:40:32,892 --> 00:40:37,828
Okay. So, I'm going to go upstairs, get warm - Good night.

819
00:40:37,922 --> 00:40:39,974
- Hey, um, before you go. 
- Hmm?

820
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:42,273
- What happened to our movie channels? 
- What do you mean?

821
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,613
Well, I was flipping through cable and a bunch of our channels are gone.

822
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:46,902
- Oh. Well, that's not right. 
- And you have bread.

823
00:40:47,046 --> 00:40:48,417
There's a connection?

824
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,594
- Are you skimping? 
- What?

825
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:53,501
Cutting back on things, cable, eating out, the bread, the cheese, the tomato.

826
00:40:53,557 --> 00:40:56,651
Okay, hey - if you're going to try me in a court of law,

827
00:40:56,712 --> 00:40:58,979
the bread, the tomato and I will need to hire a lawyer.

828
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:02,150
There's no takeout in the fridge, no takeout containers in the trash.

829
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:03,209
You're going through the trash?

830
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,564
And I'm not seeing the stacks of magazines lying around.

831
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,053
We always subscribe to everything.

832
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,648
Yes, we do. I've read them all, they're in recycle bin - you can go check.

833
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,397
It even seems a little darker in here - like you're using a lower watt bulb, or something.

834
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:16,741
Oh my God, you're reading into everything.

835
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:18,011
You're not having money problems?

836
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:22,824
No. I mean, I'm not going to be on the Fortune 500 list anytime soon, but I'm fine.

837
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,481
- With the Inn and everything? 
- Yes. We're getting a horse.

838
00:41:25,645 --> 00:41:27,750
Cool. And food for the horse?

839
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:28,912
He'll be well fed.

840
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:30,258
Just as long as you're well fed too.

841
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:33,736
Yeah, I'll call the cable company in the morning. I think we should be getting those channels.

842
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:34,851
Well, you'd tell me, right?

843
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:35,947
Yes.

844
00:41:36,945 --> 00:41:37,604
Well, goodnight.

845
00:41:37,856 --> 00:41:38,737
Good night angel.

846
00:42:07,384 --> 00:42:08,167
Go away.

847
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:13,452
- What? 
- I'm spending the night with Nicole.

848
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:15,723
- Thanks for the update. 
- The hidden key is still in the same place.

849
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:18,845
Now, you can stay out here and freeze to death if you want or you can go inside,

850
00:42:18,941 --> 00:42:20,748
I don't really give a damn, it makes no difference to me.

851
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:21,797
Fine.

852
