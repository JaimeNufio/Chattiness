1
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,283
Kleenex.

2
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,906
I'm gonna miss Stan.

3
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:32,472
I know, I'm gonna miss him too.

4
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:36,087
He was so cute, with his fedora and his Hush Puppies.

5
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,483
Everyday, the fedora and the Hush Puppies.

6
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,567
Yeah, if he just would have added some pants.

7
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:41,402
Mom!

8
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:42,958
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

9
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:44,534
'Cause you wouldn't want a downer funeral.

10
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:46,235
Ok, we're being serious now.

11
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,303
You remember every Tuesday,

12
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:50,336
Stan came to the Independence Inn for lunch?

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,236
I remember.

14
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:53,249
That was a total waste because he couldn't eat dairy,

15
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:55,232
or salt, or meat,

16
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,806
so he basically just came in every week for a salad,

17
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,997
with no oil, and no mushrooms.

18
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:03,249
- He hated mushrooms. 
- I hate mushrooms too.

19
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:04,636
Oh, here you go.

20
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:10,498
You know, he called last week and made the first lunch reservation at the Dragonfly.

21
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:12,926
- He did? 
- Don't cancel it.

22
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,608
No, of course not. We'll save a seat for Stan.

23
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,175
Save him a seat...

24
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:24,230
You'll find The Mourners' Kaddish on page 453.

25
00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:29,602
"May his illustrious name become increasingly great and holy...

26
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:32,602
Hey, did you ever notice that in Stars Hollow death comes in fives?

27
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,414
Do not try to lighten the mood!

28
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:35,627
I'm not, it's true!

29
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:36,703
It is?

30
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:39,657
Yeah, last year: Chester Thompson, Sarah Merrymen,

31
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,926
- Fran, and the Dublin twins. 
- That's right.

32
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:46,763
Yeah, year before: Chuck O'Mishner, Santos Perez Jr, Santos Perez Sr -

33
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:49,869
...Perry Lewis and Charlie Slater, you're right!

34
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,831
And now, Pinochle Downs, Mr. Angelotopolous -

35
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:54,977
- Mrs. Krenz! 
- And Stan.

36
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,987
Wait a minute, that's only four.

37
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,391
It is only four.

38
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,941
That means the fifth hasn't happened yet.

39
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:03,799
Blessed, praised,

40
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:06,230
glorified, exalted -

41
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:08,791
Number five could be in this room right now.

42
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:10,327
Oh, no.

43
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,360
- What? 
- Hank Krutzman!

44
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,443
- Hank Krutzman? 
- Why would it be Hank Krutzman?

45
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:16,240
Because he's 110!

46
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:18,457
- Hank's 110? 
- No.

47
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:20,417
Why would you say that?

48
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,507
Because, that's the age you say when someone is really old.

49
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:24,304
- I don't. 
- What age do you say?

50
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:28,124
I say the age they are, otherwise I would seem cruel and insensitive.

51
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:31,063
Fine, the point is he is very, very old.

52
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,075
That doesn't make him number five.

53
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:34,304
I don't know...

54
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:37,657
Hank Krutzman. He was such a happy guy.

55
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:39,024
He had such a good life.

56
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,632
He owned those horses.

57
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:41,948
He loved his golf.

58
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,094
- Stop! 
- What?

59
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:45,906
You guys just eulogized Hank! He's not even dead yet.

60
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:49,516
At this time, I would like to call up Stan's dear friend

61
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:52,244
and fellow Rotary Club member, Reverand Skinner.

62
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,670
Ok, but if we do think it's Hank -

63
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:57,554
- We don't think it's Hank. 
- Why not?

64
00:02:57,774 --> 00:02:59,965
Because if we think it's Hank, and then something happens

65
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:02,453
and it turns out to be Hank, then we caused it.

66
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,642
She's right.

67
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:04,900
It's not Hank.

68
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:08,009
So now, let's just focus on Stan because he's dead,

69
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:09,883
and we had nothing to do with that.

70
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,021
- Fine. 
- Right.

71
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:13,734
My good friend Stan Green lived here for 56 years.

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,129
He loved this town and it's friendly people,

73
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:18,582
charming stores and beautiful church bells.

74
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:21,030
Now, many of you don't remember the church bells.

75
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,577
They fell into disrepair about 20 years ago and have been quiet ever since.

76
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:26,431
But Stan remembered those bells,

77
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:30,477
and it was his wish that they ring out over Stars Hollow once again,

78
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:34,265
so he generously bequeathed the funds to make that dream come true.

79
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,620
We're going to restore the bells in honor of our dear friend Stan,

80
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:42,129
and every time they ring we'll think of him.

81
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:44,284
He will be missed, but never forgotten.

82
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:45,626
Oh, Stan.

83
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:46,855
Thank you, Reverend.

84
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:51,611
Now, please join us in saying goodbye at the cemetery.

85
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:56,200
That's so sweet.

86
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:57,484
Yeah, do you remember the bells?

87
00:03:57,632 --> 00:04:00,039
- No, it was before my time. 
- Me too, sounds great.

88
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,857
Oh, they were fantastic.

89
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:04,590
One of my most romantic memories happened during those bells.

90
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,978
Your first kiss?

91
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:08,112
Sure. Oh-kay.

92
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:11,150
- Oh, no! 
- Hank!

93
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:13,299
Okay. He's okay, he's okay.

94
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:14,565
Oh, thank god.

95
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:17,595
We are going to be very stressed out for the rest of Hank's life.

96
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:19,639
Serves us right for making him the fifth.

97
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,337
Hey, we did not make him the fifth, we do not have the power.

98
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:23,510
We just speculated.

99
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,526
Yeah, that was it, for all we know anyone could be the fifth.

100
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:27,692
That's right, it could be anyone. I mean Taylor,

101
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,577
or Reggie, or Andrew or Kirk.

102
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:32,489
Oh! Going dark, going dark!

103
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:37,140
We are the Witches of Eastwick.

104
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:50,740
- Yeah! 
- Perfect.

105
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:53,148
That middle-A drum roll was awesome!

106
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:54,442
- So keep it? 
- Keep it!

107
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,497
Zack, you seem less than thrilled?

108
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:59,418
Yeah man, you look like my seven year old when she's all grumpy-puss.

109
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,605
Look, far be it from me to complain -

110
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:03,320
- Since when? 
- Don't be a putz.

111
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:04,619
But you complain a lot.

112
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,437
I just think we're a little too on the beat, that's all.

113
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:08,900
Too on the beat. That's crazy.

114
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,278
How can we be too on the beat?

115
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,497
We should be off the beat?

116
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,945
Hey, fine, sorry I brought it up.

117
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,726
Let's just play perfectly on the beat and add a laser show

118
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:17,958
and a flute and be "prog" rock, if that's what you want.

119
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,597
We're just trying to figure out what you mean, Zack.

120
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,420
- So, we're too perfect? 
- I think.

121
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,446
Are we practicing too much?

122
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:24,973
We don't practice too much, we're just good.

123
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,230
I don't want to sound all fake and computerized, alright?

124
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,967
I don't wanna be N*Sync.

125
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:30,732
N*Sync, what's that?

126
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:32,480
N*Sync is one of those sucky boy-bands.

127
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:35,470
Oh, I'm rock and roll, I don't know anything about boy-bands.

128
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,522
I don't either, I've just read about them.

129
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:39,032
You read about N*Sync?

130
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:40,871
What are they, like a guilty pleasure for you or something?

131
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:42,894
Hey, if we're getting confessional and all,

132
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:45,524
I kinda like Simon and Garfunkel.

133
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,366
I've always had this thing for Fleetwood Mac, I'm embarrassed to say.

134
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:49,529
Sarah McLachlan.

135
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,003
So, N*Sync?

136
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:54,157
I'm not into N*Sync!. I just read a lot about music,

137
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:57,133
and I've read about them, and I don't read, I skim!

138
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:59,942
Hey, as far as the beat goes, we can loosen things up a bit.

139
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:02,994
- I mean, I know I can. 
- That's all I'm saying.

140
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,806
A little more Stones, a little less Kraftwerk.

141
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:08,227
Well, are we takin' a break now? I gotta make a call.

142
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,573
Yeah, let's take a break.

143
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,181
- You're so mean to him. 
- No, I'm not.

144
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:17,986
He knows exactly who you're talking about, and he's so nice.

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,242
Yeah, I mean he gets here early, he brings sandwiches from his shop.

146
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,139
Never an Italian sub with pickles, which is what I like, I must say.

147
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:27,878
I would rather you gave me the hard time instead of Gil,

148
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:29,021
since I'm the one who let him in the band.

149
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:33,022
Hey, we all let him in, we're a democracy, we all let him in the band.

150
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:36,239
Fine, we all let him in, so we should all remember that.

151
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:39,260
You guys are not going to believe this, not in a million years.

152
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,760
Xander win a soccer match?

153
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,481
No, that's at 4:00 tomorrow.

154
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:45,379
We, the band, are booked...

155
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,478
- at CBGB's. 
- We're what?

156
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:48,942
Dude, we have a gig at CBGB's.

157
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:51,052
CBGB's in New York?

158
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,691
No, in Hackensack.

159
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:54,754
Joke, dudes, the one in New York.

160
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:57,316
- Oh My God! 
- Gil, come on, are you serious?

161
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,299
Dude, I am always serious about rock and roll.

162
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:01,362
How did this happen?

163
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,032
My buddy Pete works sound there?

164
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,360
I got him a tape, he slipped it to the booker, and BAM, we're in.

165
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:09,078
- Holy bam! 
- I need my inhaler.

166
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,206
Now, it's not a great slot; It's 1:00 on a Tuesday night.

167
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:14,956
Who cares? It's CBGB's!

168
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:16,513
The Ramones started there!

169
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:20,232
Blondie, Sonic Youth, Television, Talking Heads... the list goes on and on.

170
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:23,482
I said yes. It's okay to say yes?

171
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:27,409
I guess it's okay...

172
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:31,192
- Sure is pretty, isn't it? 
- Yes, it is.

173
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:32,365
I love the first snow of the year.

174
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:33,485
I know, me too.

175
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:35,565
Although this isn't actually the first snow of the year.

176
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,727
- It isn't? 
- No.

177
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:37,926
What happened to the first snow of the year?

178
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:40,112
- I had a philosophy final. 
- Oh, right.

179
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:42,205
And the second snow of the season was on Wednesday.

180
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,973
Yeah, I had my walkthrough of the inn.

181
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:46,481
So, actually this is the third snow of the season.

182
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:47,786
Fourth, the third was on Saturday.

183
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,272
It was? Why didn't you call me?

184
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:50,879
Because, it happened in the middle of the night.

185
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:52,251
You still could have called me.

186
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,429
- In the middle of the night? 
- Yes.

187
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:55,605
You wanted me to call you, at Yale, in the middle of the night

188
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:59,220
so I could say, "Hey, drive 20 miles to stand in the snow with Mommy?"

189
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,983
And then take the craziest mother-daughter title from Judy and Liza.

190
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,539
So fourth snow of the season.

191
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,562
- Still pretty. 
- Yes, we are.

192
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:10,663
- The bells, they fixed the bells. 
- Oh, Stan.

193
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:39,286
See, if we had taken our traditional

194
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,504
"first snow of the season" walk, we wouldn't have heard the bells.

195
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,282
Bless our oppressive schedules.

196
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:45,065
I have to go drop something off at Lane's.

197
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,703
Good, 'cause I have to go drop something off at Luke's.

198
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:48,255
What?

199
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:51,115
I'm just dropping off some stuff, and a few things and -

200
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:52,508
- Mom? 
- I need coffee.

201
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:53,431
I'll meet you there.

202
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:55,233
Hurry, we can come back out for the bells in half an hour.

203
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:57,548
Order me some coffee, a muffin and some onion rings.

204
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,309
Look what I pass on to the next generation.

205
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,664
Eating habits from Hades.

206
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:01,817
Love that DNA!

207
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,305
Pursue an interview with a distinguished leader

208
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,226
with great influence on the community state or nation.

209
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:10,362
Well, that sounds like it should be interesting.

210
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:11,744
Who should we interview?

211
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:14,936
- Oh, Jordan! 
- Pastor Cho is available.

212
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:18,595
Yes! Pastor Cho would be interesting

213
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,246
and... convenient since his house is right on campus,

214
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:25,386
so okay, good option in Pastor Cho. Any other suggestions?

215
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:27,105
Assistant Pastor Eric?

216
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,981
Yes. Assistant Pastor Eric, also a fine idea,

217
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,650
he lives next door to Pastor Cho.

218
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:35,400
Would anyone like to think outside the clergy?

219
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:36,261
Why?

220
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,653
Pastor Cho did it last year.

221
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,190
Pastor Cho does it every year.

222
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:41,729
So then perhaps Pastor Cho might like a rest?

223
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:43,491
Then it would be Assistant Pastor Eric!

224
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,945
Hey, I have an idea.

225
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,251
How about we send a letter to Bill Clinton.

226
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,253
It's probably be a long shot, but you never know!

227
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:51,806
- Bill Clinton? 
- Yeah!

228
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,757
But Pastor Cho is expecting our call.

229
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:56,961
Unless he's sick, in which case it would be Assistant Pastor Eric!

230
00:10:57,263 --> 00:11:00,365
- Yes, but I... 
- Lane! Rory is here to see you.

231
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,430
Rory! Hi, and bless you.

232
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:07,533
Lane! Hi and... thank you.

233
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:12,162
Rory, this is Andy, Sarah, Jill, Marla and Jordan.

234
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:14,703
Nice to meet you all. I didn't mean to interrupt,

235
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,111
I just wanted to return your book and get another one.

236
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,131
Oh, of course.

237
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:20,114
I'll be right back

238
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:21,532
Please hurry, the tea is almost ready.

239
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:22,505
I will.

240
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,990
So, how did you like it?

241
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,202
It's great, I burned a copy for my Mom.

242
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:32,300
You know, its people like you who are destroying the music industry!

243
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,897
Oh, now. Britney's gotta shoulder some of the blame.

244
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:39,340
Let me see. How about The New Pornographers?

245
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,236
Sold.

246
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,897
So, it's quite a lively bunch you got down there.

247
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:45,653
Oh yeah, I'm kind of worried, all of those breakables.

248
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:46,764
What are you working on?

249
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:50,298
Oh, the usual: how to avoid any contact with the outside world.

250
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,466
Those guys must really be screwing up the curve.

251
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:54,613
- Yes, it's annoying. 
- Everyday?

252
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:57,946
Yes, but I could care less because today, all I can think about is the gig!

253
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,089
I mean, I can't believe it!

254
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,710
I'm actually going to be on stage at CBGBs!

255
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:03,584
I know, but how are you going to get there?

256
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:07,189
Oh, I will get there. As we speak, I am working on the perfect alibi.

257
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,498
Oh, what do ya got so far?

258
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:14,382
Mama, may I run something past you?

259
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,748
That's it.

260
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:18,245
I like it.

261
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:21,565
Yeah, so I was originally gonna start with "Can I run something past you,"

262
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:24,003
but I thought the may I added a certain level of respect.

263
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,387
I agree. However, you now need to add an excuse.

264
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:30,500
I've come up with lots of, you know, mid-afternoon

265
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:33,598
and evening alibis, but so far no 1:00 AM alibis.

266
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:36,112
You can always tell your Mom that you're sleeping over at my dorm.

267
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:38,697
She knows they're co-ed. By the way, she's praying for you.

268
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,448
So, you wanna borrow the new Sparks?

269
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,411
Please!

270
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:43,070
Oh, now how about this?

271
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:46,342
Tell your Mom that you're taking an astronomy class,

272
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,548
and you have to go on a field trip to look at the stars.

273
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,364
There are no astronomy classes at Adventist College.

274
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:52,808
That would imply the universe is old.

275
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:54,395
Not a lot of loopholes in your world, huh?

276
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:55,777
It's okay, I'll come up with something.

277
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:58,436
My entire life has been a training session for this very event.

278
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:00,242
- I have faith in you. 
- Thank you.

279
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:01,364
Wait!

280
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:06,300
Oop! Getting a little sloppy, there.

281
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:12,331
- Lane! Your classmates are waiting. 
- Sorry, Mama.

282
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:14,896
I gotta go. Thank you for the book.

283
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:16,299
- Bye, Mrs. Kim. 
- Wait!

284
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:22,130
"Jane - One woman's harrowing journey to God."

285
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:23,814
Good choice!

286
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:25,991
Thank you, ma'am.

287
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,278
Smart move, jumping on my bandwagon

288
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,988
with the International Relations Association.

289
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:32,621
- Like I had a choice. 
- What?

290
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,157
You dragged me here, Paris.

291
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:36,702
You'll thank me when you're interviewing for grad school in a few years

292
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:39,083
and find those waifish looks of yours aren't quite as charming.

293
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,092
Whatever that means.

294
00:13:40,243 --> 00:13:42,294
It means these kind of clubs look good on your resumé.

295
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,854
You know what also looks good on a resumé? Passing your classes.

296
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:46,799
No one studies more than you do, you're fine.

297
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:50,818
Now, remember to argue, even if you have nothing to say, or add, be vocal.

298
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,430
Very few people in lifelisten to what anyone else says anyhow.

299
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,597
It's all about volume.

300
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,633
Can I ask why you're suddenly so interested in international relations?

301
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:58,479
You're pre-med.

302
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:02,425
It's critical to step out of one's major and experience our worlds sweeping expanse.

303
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:04,218
Plus, a certain fellow told me about it.

304
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:05,395
Okay, enough with that.

305
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:08,176
Oh, this is too much.

306
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,648
- What? 
- Our advisor, Professor Friedman.

307
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,661
- You know her? 
- Of her.

308
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:14,805
Her daughter was busted last spring by New Haven police

309
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:18,013
for growing pot in their basement, right during harvest season.

310
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,356
Strangely, it never made the papers.

311
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,464
Then how do you know about it?

312
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:21,457
A certain fellow told me.

313
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:23,371
I have got to stop asking questions.

314
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:37,099
- Luke? 
- Yeah, Kirk.

315
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,228
- What time is it? 
- I'm not saying, Kirk.

316
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:39,935
Why not?

317
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:41,619
Because I just told you 30 seconds ago!

318
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:44,513
More like 45 seconds if you add in all the bickering.

319
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,765
3:58.

320
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,557
Only two minutes until the bells.

321
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:50,538
Unless of course, I'm fast.

322
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:52,766
You're cruel at times, Luke.

323
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:54,323
Only when poked with a stick.

324
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:55,828
Coffee, big cup and hello!

325
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:57,804
Lorelai, what time do you have?

326
00:14:57,911 --> 00:14:59,509
Do not tell him. He already knows.

327
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:00,513
I do not!

328
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:03,000
If you just wait for the bells, then you'll get to hear the bells,

329
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:04,307
and then you'll know what time it is.

330
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,935
Actually, that's not true.

331
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:09,019
The other day I stood too close to the bells and they rang so loud

332
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:11,607
that there's now a persistent ringing in my ears.

333
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:14,536
Now I can't tell which are the church bells and which are the Kirk bells.

334
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:15,980
Oh, no. Did you go to the doctor?

335
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:17,634
Yes, he said I have tinnitis.

336
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:21,280
I looked it up on the web at "Celebrities Who Share Your Disease"

337
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,265
and found that William Shatner is likewise afflicted.

338
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:26,082
Really, Kirk and Captain Kirk?

339
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:27,670
The irony wasn't lost on me.

340
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:28,903
Was that them?

341
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:32,078
Relax, the church bells will be the loud obnoxious ones.

342
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,850
Somebody doesn't like bells.

343
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:35,566
Not everyone likes bells.

344
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:36,983
No, actually they do.

345
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:39,589
They enjoy the constant interruptions of conversations,

346
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:43,390
the monotonous drone of the same tones, hour after hour?

347
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:45,472
Yes! Can you believe it?

348
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:49,338
These are the same freaks who also like sunsets and the moon and the stars...

349
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,511
What are the paint chips for?

350
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,070
Oh, I'm just doing some painting.

351
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:57,197
Oh, really? You're not gonna collect and trade them amongst your friends?

352
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:58,375
What are you painting?

353
00:15:58,702 --> 00:16:00,361
Our apartment.

354
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,204
You and I, we're getting an apartment?

355
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,728
No. Me and Nicole. We're getting an apartment.

356
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,888
Oh! That's great. When?

357
00:16:08,164 --> 00:16:09,367
When what?

358
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,734
When are you getting an apartment?

359
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:11,882
Three weeks ago.

360
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:13,627
Three weeks … You moved already?

361
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,910
So, where is the apartment?

362
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:20,048
Litchfield.

363
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,645
You moved to Litchfield?

364
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,127
Three weeks ago you moved to Litchfield?

365
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:26,893
Litchfield is another county.

366
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,175
Three weeks ago you moved to another county?

367
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:32,960
Were you gonna mention this to me anytime soon?

368
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:34,113
- Sure. 
- When?

369
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:35,551
- When it came up. 
- When it came up.

370
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:38,218
Okay, so if I hadn't asked for the next twenty or thirty years

371
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,265
and I sent you a nice fruit basket upstairs you just never would have gotten it.

372
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:43,186
- It's not that big a deal. 
- Okay.

373
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:44,941
I mean it's not like we tell each other everything.

374
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:46,519
No! Of course we don't!

375
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:50,138
I mean, I tore a pair of panty hose this morning and I didn't tell you about it.

376
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:51,648
Oh wait, I guess I just did.

377
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:53,717
- Hey, you know now, right? 
- Yeah. Right.

378
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:55,116
Look, nothing's changed.

379
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,772
Yeah nothing's changed, except you don't live here!

380
00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:59,170
- So what? 
- So?

381
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:01,991
- I don't even have your phone number. 
- I'll give you my phone number.

382
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,670
I don't even know what you live in!

383
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:06,962
- An apartment, a trailer, a batcave... 
- A townhouse.

384
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:10,869
A townhouse? Sure, 'cause when I look at you I think "common driveway".

385
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:13,275
It's fine, you'll come over and see it eventually.

386
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:16,414
Will I? Will I come over, because me coming over implies we're friends!

387
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:19,061
- We are friends! 
- No, we're not!

388
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:22,311
We're not friends! Friends tell each other at least the most basic things

389
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:25,113
like where you live and when you moved away.

390
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,709
I thought we were friends but I guess we're not!

391
00:17:27,857 --> 00:17:29,137
- Where are you going? 
- I can't stay!

392
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,304
Lorelai!

393
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,505
Damn bells!

394
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:38,014
Oh! This is the tragedy that results when your mom

395
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,257
goes out of town leaving your dad in charge of the care package.

396
00:17:41,446 --> 00:17:42,986
Cling peaches in light syrup.

397
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:46,254
They make Rice Krispies Treats in foil packs now, how hard is that?

398
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,716
Hey, want your smile back? Pork Top Ramen.

399
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,062
For that, you share your care package.

400
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:53,366
Fine. My mom doesn't bake but she knows people who do.

401
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,818
This makes great packing material…

402
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:58,337
Look, look, look. The guy over by the vending machine.

403
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:01,245
Two thumbs up!

404
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:03,953
That is my friend Josh's roommate, William.

405
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:05,684
Ah! Hello your highness.

406
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,185
I'm seriously debating a move here.

407
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:08,639
Nakedness tends to work.

408
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,636
I met him at this party this weekend.

409
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:12,775
He's pretty cool - and funny!

410
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:15,131
He tells this story about a girl in this dorm.

411
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:18,331
She doesn't even know him, she just comes up to him and starts talking to him,

412
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:20,543
and he's talking to her, you know, just to be nice,

413
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:22,678
but she thinks he's into her or something,

414
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,418
so like three seconds later she asks him out.

415
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:29,263
Of course he said no. But I guess to her no doesn't mean 'no',

416
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:31,864
so now she's showing up everywhere he is.

417
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,109
He calls her his "adoring fan."

418
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:36,653
Did he say who it was?

419
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:40,112
Someone cranked up the karaoke machine right at that moment so no, no names.

420
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,122
But his impression of her asking him out,

421
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:47,551
all flitty eyelashes and 'look how hot I am' is hilarious.

422
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,363
Oooh, intrigue.

423
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,442
Psycho girl in the dorm.

424
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,055
I wonder who it can be?

425
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,855
So, now that he lives in Litchfield, what's that supposed to mean?

426
00:18:56,931 --> 00:18:58,191
According to Luke, nothing!

427
00:18:58,293 --> 00:18:59,188
But what about the diner?

428
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,807
Oh, he said the diner's fine, everything's fine!

429
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:04,115
And he's gonna continue working here even though he's living there?

430
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:07,396
Yes, apparently he'll go from being grumpy Luke to grumpy-commuter Luke.

431
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:09,921
Luke plus road-rage, there's a healthy combination.

432
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,999
Ooh! What do you think of that sconce?

433
00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:15,502
Oh, it's too British. I swear, that guy should work for the CIA.

434
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:17,181
He gives away nothing, absolutely nothing!

435
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,655
I have friends there.

436
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,857
- What? Where? 
- The CIA.

437
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:22,726
- No, you don't. 
- Yes, I...

438
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,403
Ah, you didn't mean the Culinary Institute of America?

439
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,213
No.

440
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:29,448
Okay, then. Oh! What about this?

441
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,060
No, too Spanish. Three weeks he's been living there!

442
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:33,739
Three weeks, and not a single word,

443
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:36,436
and he looked at me like I was completely insane to be upset.

444
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,680
- What about this one? 
- Too German.

445
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:39,966
How can a sconce be too German?

446
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,419
It's shaped like an knockwurst.

447
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:42,535
It is not.

448
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,854
Oh, it is. Why would they do that?

449
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:47,441
Maybe I am insane, I mean what's the big deal right?

450
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:50,282
Just because I go in there for coffee every day that doesn't make us friends.

451
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:51,542
You are friends!

452
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:54,008
Yes, but I thought we were 'friend' friends,

453
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,459
and apparently we're just coffee friends.

454
00:19:55,556 --> 00:19:57,584
I buy the coffee and he's my friend.

455
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,013
It's like a dog and a liver treat.

456
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:01,414
If you have a liver treat, the dog will like you and, that's us.

457
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:03,261
Which one are you, the dog or the liver treat?

458
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,496
I was the liver treat,

459
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,048
and I thought I was a collar or at least a really cute leash and I'm not.

460
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,348
I wanna chime in and be supportive,

461
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,125
but I don't know what you're talking about.

462
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:13,665
I'm talking about nothing, nevermind.

463
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,916
I'm coming, Cookie.

464
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,856
What's the matter, is he hungry?

465
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,571
No, it's the bells.

466
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:22,768
The bells aren't ringing.

467
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:24,423
No, but they're about to.

468
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:26,086
He's crying in anticipation of the bells?

469
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,295
He hates them.

470
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:30,382
At first he just cried when they rang, and now he knows their schedule.

471
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:31,774
Oh, that's terrible!

472
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:34,176
Believe me, the 5:00 AM-ers are the worst.

473
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,950
Oh, oh, I know.

474
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:38,569
Poor thing.

475
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:40,864
Hey, Sookie.

476
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:43,122
Look, it's Luke.

477
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,596
What's he doing?

478
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,114
He's shovelling my walk.

479
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:51,733
He's good.

480
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,218
I'll be right back.

481
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:00,673
Oh, you missed a spot.

482
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:03,734
This is really nice Luke.

483
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:06,074
Can we fight again 'cause I need my rain gutters cleaned.

484
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:09,131
You think everything is your business.

485
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:11,461
Everything is about you!

486
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:14,743
Well, here's a newsflash. Some things are not about you.

487
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:15,751
Why are you yelling at me?

488
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:19,002
If I want to move in with Nicole, it concerns her and it concerns me,

489
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:20,815
- and that is it. 
- Yeah, I know.

490
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:23,790
It does not concern you! It is none of your business!

491
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:26,333
I don't have to tell you anything!

492
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:30,001
And you do not have the right to make me feel guilty because I didn't tell you anything.

493
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:32,341
- I wasn't trying... 
- I have been tying my own shoes

494
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:36,001
since I was I was four, I have repairing my own car since I was fourteen,

495
00:21:36,124 --> 00:21:39,084
and I have been making my own decisions since I could crawl!

496
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:39,996
What does any of that have to do with anything?

497
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:42,258
I owe you nothing!

498
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:43,563
- Fine. 
- Nothing!

499
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:44,531
Fine!

500
00:21:44,684 --> 00:21:46,888
And shovel your walk! It is a safety hazard

501
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:51,096
and you can't just walk past it and ignore the fact that the snow is up to your ass!

502
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,743
You've got my shovel!

503
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:55,013
I loaned it to you three years ago!

504
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,286
When you boil it down, isn't the whole Israeli-Palestinian problem

505
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,386
- a case of sibling rivalry? 
- Follow up?

506
00:22:02,632 --> 00:22:04,331
The Old Testament, it's all there.

507
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:06,922
Israelis are descendents of Abraham and Sarah.

508
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,548
Arabs are descendents of Abraham and his maid Hagar.

509
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:11,933
So Israelis and Arabs both have the same dad,

510
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:14,582
and both want the great nation God promised Abraham.

511
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:17,003
They might as well be fighting over who gets the TV remote.

512
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,825
Your Biblical facts are correct, Paris,

513
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:21,959
but your arguments disregard the complexities of the last 4000 years.

514
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:24,222
I know research takes time.

515
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:27,095
At least I don't have to worry about Cheech growing Thai stick in the rec room.

516
00:22:27,198 --> 00:22:28,160
- What? 
- Nothing.

517
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:29,404
Okay. Anyone else?

518
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,603
It's just a power struggle, nothing mysterious.

519
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:33,773
- Follow up? 
- Who wins in this game?

520
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:36,132
And in whose best interest is it to keep the kids fighting?

521
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:38,436
Right, like they're some all powerful entity,

522
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,581
manipulating the entire population of Israel.

523
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,291
There's a good thought process for you.

524
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:44,059
- Excuse me? 
- It's more complex than that.

525
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,582
- But if you disregard power... 
- That's not what I said.

526
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:49,818
Maybe if you sat up straight for a minute you could hear a little more clearly.

527
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,113
Decorum, people.

528
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:54,012
Israel is made up of over 6 million individuals,

529
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,798
each with a unique view on the situation.

530
00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:59,433
You know something about a unique view of a situation, don't you?

531
00:22:59,735 --> 00:23:00,519
I guess -

532
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,352
Because propaganda and the spreading of blatant, heinous, ridiculous lies

533
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:08,492
can cause more damage than guns or bombs or any sort of weaponry.

534
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,407
Personally, if I'm in an alley with Osama,

535
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,550
I'd rather he was armed with a blatant, heinous lie than an Uzi.

536
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:14,630
That's cause you're an idiot.

537
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,812
You know, you didn't look scary when you came in here.

538
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:18,275
Oh yeah, give me back my pencil.

539
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:21,697
Okay, you two. Let's take a cooling off period and hear from someone else.

540
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:23,943
Sarah, your thoughts on this.

541
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:26,790
- I'm starving. 
- Order a pizza.

542
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:28,858
No, it's snowing, they won't deliver.

543
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,798
- Then go to Al's. 
- It's curry night!

544
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:32,401
China Charlie's sounds pretty good.

545
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,004
- I hate Chinese. 
- Since when?

546
00:23:34,117 --> 00:23:34,824
Since tonight!

547
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:36,267
You're acting like a four year old.

548
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:37,681
I don't care, I'm bored.

549
00:23:37,804 --> 00:23:39,328
This is stupid, just go to Luke's.

550
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:40,409
No. Way.

551
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:42,237
Oh, come on, you guys always fight.

552
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,203
- Not like this. 
- And then you make up.

553
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,892
No, I'm not going to Luke's.

554
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:48,530
- You're gonna starve to death. 
- Well fine, I will starve to death,

555
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:50,649
because I'm not going to reward bad behavior.

556
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:51,945
Is there something in the fridge?

557
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,224
Nothing edible.

558
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,314
There's Beefaroni. You like Beefaroni.

559
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,773
I'm not in the mood for Beefaroni.

560
00:23:57,128 --> 00:23:58,540
Mom, you have to do something.

561
00:23:58,668 --> 00:23:59,625
I need a suggestion.

562
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,687
- Have you read The Bell Jar? 
- Not funny!

563
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:03,439
Okay, you know what, you're on your own.

564
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:05,021
No, no! Come on!

565
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,141
I have to study and you're in your stubborn mood.

566
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:09,905
Hey! I sat up with you all night when you had the chicken pox.

567
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:13,055
I held your hands so that you couldn't scratch your face and scar your perfect skin.

568
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:14,985
- You look that way because of me. 
- Night, mom.

569
00:24:15,128 --> 00:24:16,485
But, ah, the chicken pox!

570
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,225
Beefaroni, it's calling you!

571
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:34,958
One, and two, and three and four.

572
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:37,518
Ignore the bells, they aren't the beat.

573
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:40,252
The bells will screw, it all to hell.

574
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:43,226
And one, and two, and three, and four...

575
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,836
You want to help me break the bells?

576
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:01,664
I'll get my toolbox.

577
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:08,751
- I'll just be a sec. 
- 'Kay.

578
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,165
Got it, let's go.

579
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:26,558
Right behind you.

580
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:40,142
Sorry, Zack, anything immobile is fair game.

581
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,491
- I'm so hyped. 
- Me too.

582
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,721
Did you find Blondie anywhere?

583
00:25:43,823 --> 00:25:45,677
No, I think they repainted at some point.

584
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:47,821
Repainting is so not rock and roll!

585
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:51,324
You have seriously gotta stop that.

586
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,363
Sue me.

587
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:53,716
Hey, here are The Strokes!

588
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:54,749
Yawn.

589
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:57,754
Hey, you almost done, you've been tuning for a half hour.

590
00:25:57,985 --> 00:25:59,869
Almost. Geez, I'm nervous.

591
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:01,399
Yeah, you're shaking like the Pope.

592
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,197
- You do it for me. 
- Fine.

593
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:04,887
So, do we get to sign the wall?

594
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:06,521
Oh, we are signing the wall!

595
00:26:06,627 --> 00:26:09,085
It's the whole reason to be in the band, that and the loose chicks.

596
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,478
Here are The Strokes again!

597
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:11,936
Yeah, they're over there too.

598
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:14,226
Man, they're overexposed, even on walls.

599
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:18,671
Hey guys, bad news. I'm gonna have to bump you.

600
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:20,225
- What? 
- What does that mean?

601
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:22,038
It means you're bumped. You're not playing.

602
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:23,089
We'll reschedule, okay?

603
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:24,230
Drag!

604
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,592
I guess I can stop tuning.

605
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:27,902
No, don't stop tuning. I don't get this, why are we being bumped?

606
00:26:28,092 --> 00:26:29,816
There's like two people out in the audience

607
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:33,056
and they're born again or something, and they're not even drinking.

608
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:34,573
I'll get 'em drinking, I'm very good

609
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,031
at working around religious mandates.

610
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:38,208
- Older couple? 
- Yeah.

611
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:40,228
That's my parents. They don't drink.

612
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,000
We'll just play for Brian's parents, that's fine with us.

613
00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:45,945
- This is unbelievable! 
- Look guys, it happens.

614
00:26:46,077 --> 00:26:48,965
- I'm sorry, we're playing tonight. 
- To an empty room.

615
00:26:49,114 --> 00:26:51,295
Every band plays to empty rooms at some point.

616
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:52,882
They can be the most classic gigs.

617
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:54,418
Look, I've already sent people home.

618
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,015
The doorman, the waitresses-

619
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,573
You don't need them, there's no one out there.

620
00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:59,298
- The sound guy. 
- We don't need sound!

621
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,792
Look, it's not up to you.

622
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:02,364
We'll reschedule, okay?

623
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,053
- Nice goin', dude. 
- Don't dump on Gil!

624
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:08,046
Excuse me, we're not done.

625
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:09,293
I think we are.

626
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:12,420
No, we are not just little gnats that you can flick away.

627
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:13,961
We are professionals and some of us have gone through

628
00:27:14,058 --> 00:27:16,276
a lot of trouble to be here tonight, a lot of trouble.

629
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:18,395
Then you have a lot of my sympathies.

630
00:27:19,194 --> 00:27:20,197
I need a cigarette.

631
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:22,112
Get cancer, Darryl!

632
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:24,355
Lane! Come on, you gotta roll with the punches.

633
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:26,065
- No, we have to play tonight. 
- We can't!

634
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:27,990
What are you doing?

635
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:30,592
Packing up?

636
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:32,451
Just because Darryl said to?

637
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:33,428
He's the booker.

638
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:36,223
No, he's the man, and rock and roll is about saying no to the man!

639
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,608
- This is a lot of trouble for nothing! 
- Guys!

640
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:40,689
- I said I'm sorry! 
- It's not Gil's fault!

641
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:41,502
Then whose is it?

642
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:43,530
Look, you gotta roll with the punches too, Zack.

643
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:45,203
You just stepped on my guitar!

644
00:27:45,337 --> 00:27:46,975
- I didn't see it. 
- What are you blind?

645
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:49,187
- Pretty much. 
- Dude, get it together.

646
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,045
I cannot believe that your parents don't drink.

647
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,021
What, they lock the door to a church, are they serious?

648
00:28:00,103 --> 00:28:01,204
What if I need to do something holy?

649
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:02,571
Like commit vandalism?

650
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,481
Even she's sick of hearing the damn bells.

651
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,104
- I'm gonna have to break the lock 
- No wait.

652
00:28:06,826 --> 00:28:07,435
What are you doing?

653
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,924
All those years of watching Hart to Hart are about to pay off.

654
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,027
- What is that? 
- It's my gym card.

655
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:13,174
You joined a gym?

656
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:14,141
- Yeah. 
- When?

657
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,307
After I had Rory, to lose the pregnancy weight.

658
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:18,956
- Did you go? 
- God, no. I was way too fat.

659
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:26,211
Ah, praise be to Him and all the little lambs that frolic the earth

660
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,597
- with their frankincense and myrrh and... 
- Would you get inside?

661
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,830
Oy! Would it kill God to dust?

662
00:28:35,984 --> 00:28:40,261
Okay, now just hold the flashlight, do not do any moving spotlight gags

663
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:43,312
and point it at me and yell "Freeze, drop your weapons."

664
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:47,412
How about if I shine it on the wall and do a dirty hand puppet show?

665
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:50,101
Just stand back so the lightning only strikes you.

666
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:52,279
So, what's the game plan here?

667
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:55,241
Personally, I thought we could whack the bells really hard with a hammer.

668
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:57,408
You don't break bells with a hammer.

669
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:59,117
Okay, I'm out. What's your plan, Clyde?

670
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,013
I was thinking we could just jam the turnbuckle,

671
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:05,288
or wedge the main mechanism,

672
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,123
just for fun disconnect a few of the clappers;

673
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:10,745
Contrary to popular belief you don't have to break every bell.

674
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:12,316
If you just damage a couple,

675
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:15,183
say the tierce and the prime, you pretty much ruin the set.

676
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:17,790
You must have been the top of your class at hunchback school.

677
00:29:17,913 --> 00:29:19,561
Let's just say you can wait your whole life

678
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:22,787
waiting for bells to fall into disrepair. Sometimes they need a push.

679
00:29:22,946 --> 00:29:25,660
No way! You broke the bells.

680
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:26,633
You're welcome.

681
00:29:27,176 --> 00:29:30,089
It's a little narrow up there, so we should just take the tools that we need,

682
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:31,169
leave the toolbox down here.

683
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:33,381
God, these things are heavy. Don't you have a smaller toolbox?

684
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:35,803
No, why would I have two toolboxes?

685
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:37,441
'Cause then you'd have a big one and a small one.

686
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:39,276
If you have a big one you don't need a small one.

687
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:42,286
Don't say 'dirty', it's too easy. Hold these.

688
00:29:44,456 --> 00:29:48,100
So, why wasn't your toolbox at your new place?

689
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,334
I needed it here.

690
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:53,350
Usually moving requires lots of tools;

691
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:55,914
hanging things, putting things together.

692
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:58,024
Nicole hired a professional picture-hanger

693
00:29:58,121 --> 00:29:59,622
and we didn't have anything to put together.

694
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:01,629
- Hand me a screwdriver. 
- Phillips or flathead?

695
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:03,969
- I know things. 
- Phillips.

696
00:30:06,457 --> 00:30:08,515
Luke, how come you told me you moved?

697
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:09,497
I did move.

698
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,618
You may have moved, but none of your stuff did.

699
00:30:11,838 --> 00:30:14,320
What are you talking about? Hand me the open-ended wrench.

700
00:30:14,905 --> 00:30:17,947
Luke, I was in your apartment. It's exactly the same.

701
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:19,000
No, it's not.

702
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:22,098
I just think it's weird you're pretending you moved when you didn't.

703
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,110
I did move.

704
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,872
- Luke, your bed wasn't even made. 
- So?

705
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,590
There were dishes in the sink, some kind of shake in the blender,

706
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:30,357
Mega-Man protein powder on the counter.

707
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:31,971
Remind me to mock you for that later, by the way.

708
00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:33,147
Can we talk about something else?

709
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,488
Or better yet, let's not talk and just get this done.

710
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,732
Does Nicole think you moved?

711
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:38,835
Of course she thinks I moved, I did move.

712
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,801
- Do you sleep there? 
- Of course I sleep there.

713
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:43,100
When was the last time you slept there?

714
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:45,036
- I live there. 
- So, last night?

715
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:49,387
I had an early delivery and it didn't make sense to sleep there.

716
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:51,620
- The day before? 
- I was there for dinner.

717
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:52,439
And after dinner?

718
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:55,445
Nicole was getting a sore throat so it made sense to go back to my place

719
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,950
- and not get sick. 
- Your place?

720
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,578
My old place.

721
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,596
You didn't say your old place, you said your place.

722
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:02,306
Well, I meant my old place.

723
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:05,772
- Luke, you don't live with Nicole. 
- Yes, I do.

724
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:08,871
You watch her TV, you eat her food, you keep stuff in a duffel bag at her house;

725
00:31:08,972 --> 00:31:10,290
you're a rude guest, not her boyfriend!

726
00:31:10,386 --> 00:31:12,418
- Husband. 
- Whole other discussion.

727
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,873
You know what, you're doing it again.

728
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:14,527
Doing what again?

729
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:17,124
You're passing judgment on my relationship with Nicole.

730
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,230
I'm not passing judgment.

731
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:20,850
You passed judgment on our marriage, you passed judgment on our divorce

732
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,010
and now you're passing judgment on our living together.

733
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,623
I'm not passing judgment on you living together.

734
00:31:25,756 --> 00:31:28,229
You're passing judgment on you living together… by not living together.

735
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:30,271
You know, I was a little tipsy on that cruise ship,

736
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:33,149
but I don't remember anyone pronouncing us husband and wife and Lorelai.

737
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,357
They may as well have,

738
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,395
because I spend as much time with Nicole as you do.

739
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:37,660
And the judgment's back!

740
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:40,036
I could move in with you guys. You wouldn't know.

741
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:42,418
You know, none of this is any of your business.

742
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:43,912
- It's absolutely my business. 
- How?

743
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:47,603
Because! I wasted a week of my life adjusting to the idea

744
00:31:47,715 --> 00:31:50,183
that you had moved only to find out that you haven't moved.

745
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,918
How much adjusting did you have to do? Nothing's changed!

746
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,442
I still see you everyday, I still cook your food,

747
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,823
I still serve your coffee. What do you care?

748
00:31:58,643 --> 00:32:00,300
- I care. 
- Why?

749
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:02,578
Because I don't want you to move.

750
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:05,718
Why? Why don't you want me to move?

751
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:12,210
Lorelai? Luke?

752
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:18,128
Oh, thank God! Carry on.

753
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:27,242
Paris! It's 4:00 in the morning!

754
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,052
What are you doing here?

755
00:32:31,144 --> 00:32:32,438
Funny you should ask,

756
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:34,912
because I didn't know what to do and you always seem to know what to do,

757
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,872
so I thought I'd drop by and ask you what to do.

758
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:38,661
About what?

759
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:39,776
I didn't come up with one.

760
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:41,303
- One what? 
- One alibi.

761
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:42,019
What?

762
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:43,150
I couldn't think of anything!

763
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,148
Lane!

764
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,826
I swear, I tried, but nothing I came up with sounded

765
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,194
like she would believe it so I just left.

766
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:49,305
What do you mean you just left?

767
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:53,518
I mean I waited until she went to bed, which was about 9:15, and then I left.

768
00:32:53,678 --> 00:32:54,849
You didn't leave a note?

769
00:32:56,262 --> 00:32:57,067
You didn't call?

770
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:59,484
I don't even think I locked the door behind me.

771
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:00,656
Lane, this is bad.

772
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:03,534
I know, but I couldn't miss the gig, Rory.

773
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,214
I mean it was CBGB's!

774
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:07,625
I had to go and she wouldn't let me go.

775
00:33:09,395 --> 00:33:10,190
Where are you going?

776
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:11,588
You have to call your mom.

777
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:12,724
No way.

778
00:33:13,246 --> 00:33:14,869
Lane, she could be freaking out right now.

779
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:16,554
I can't tell her. I can't call her.

780
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:18,355
Well, what are you gonna do, just never go home again?

781
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:19,774
You say that like it's a bad thing.

782
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:21,669
It is a bad thing, a really bad thing!

783
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:22,769
I can't talk to her.

784
00:33:23,183 --> 00:33:23,799
Fine.

785
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:26,246
Who are you calling?

786
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:32,293
I hate you.

787
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,844
- Mom, are you awake? 
- No.

788
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:35,667
- Could you be awake? 
- What's the matter?

789
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:37,720
- Lane's here. 
- What? Why?

790
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:40,234
She snuck out of her house tonight, and she's scared to go home.

791
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:41,827
She snuck out?

792
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:43,439
She had something to do with the band.

793
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:45,601
She snuck out!

794
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:46,615
Yes.

795
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:47,684
Bye.

796
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:48,672
What are you doing?

797
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:50,050
I'm calling Mrs. Kim.

798
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:51,126
Mom, no.

799
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:53,264
Rory, if I woke up and you weren't there,

800
00:33:53,368 --> 00:33:54,770
I would have a friggin' heart attack.

801
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:58,508
Now keep Lane there and tell her I am pissed as hell at her.

802
00:33:58,728 --> 00:33:59,742
Goodbye.

803
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:09,460
Mrs. Kim, it's Lorelai Gilmore. I am so sorry to be calling so late and,

804
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:13,622
I don't know if you know this or not, but Lane isn't there.

805
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:14,723
Where is she?

806
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,481
Well, she went out tonight, and I think she was just scared to tell you about it,

807
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:21,154
but she is fine. She's with Rory at Yale

808
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:24,267
and they're safe and they promise to stay put.

809
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:25,464
Give me the address!

810
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:29,628
198 Elm Street, Durfee Hall, suite five. Do you need directions?

811
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:31,148
I have a navigational system.

812
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:33,579
Okay, well, call me if you need anything.

813
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:57,895
Luke!

814
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,531
Hey, Mrs. Kim. You're up early.

815
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:03,281
I just want to tell you that Lane will not be coming to work today.

816
00:35:03,497 --> 00:35:04,833
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

817
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,846
You know?

818
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:06,743
Yeah, she called.

819
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,463
- She called? 
- Twice.

820
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:11,412
She left a message last night and she called again a minute ago

821
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:15,451
just to make sure I got it. I tell you, that is one responsible kid.

822
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:17,064
- She called you? 
- Twice.

823
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:20,085
She called you, she called Lorelai.

824
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:21,125
Is everything okay?

825
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,568
Everything's fine.

826
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,550
- I'm going home. 
- Okay.

827
00:35:45,783 --> 00:35:47,738
Let's not stray too far from the coffee cart.

828
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,397
I can barely feel my feet this morning.

829
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:51,312
The floor wasn't too comfortable, huh?

830
00:35:51,492 --> 00:35:54,047
No, tit was fine until Paris came home and stepped on my face.

831
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,213
The stepping on my face wasn't too comfortable.

832
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:58,445
At least Paris doesn't tend to wear heels.

833
00:35:58,798 --> 00:35:59,986
Where was she so late?

834
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:03,130
I don't know, Paris's business is Paris's business.

835
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:04,953
I wish I lived in a dorm.

836
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,473
Hey, have you called your mother yet?

837
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:07,369
Nope.

838
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:10,902
Oh good, because the longer you wait, the easier it's going to be.

839
00:36:11,178 --> 00:36:14,041
I still can't believe she didn't just show up in the middle of the night,

840
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:16,856
kick down the door, douse the place with holy water.

841
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,344
Maybe she wanted a chance to cool off.

842
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:21,060
No, that's your mother.

843
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,093
My mother's the kicker and the douser.

844
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:25,079
No, Mrs. Kim is sending a message.

845
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:26,329
What message is that?

846
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:28,806
The message is, "You messed up, kid,

847
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,884
and now you get to sit there and panic about what's gonna happen next,

848
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,965
and while you're panicking thinking about what's gonna happen next,

849
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:36,236
you get to find your own way home,

850
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:39,184
cause the Mrs. Kim shuttle van service is closed for business."

851
00:36:39,354 --> 00:36:40,502
So, it's a wordy message.

852
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,360
Everything's so screwed up:

853
00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:44,822
my life, everything I'm doing.

854
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:45,944
It's not that bad.

855
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:48,160
It is that bad. I mean, look at this.

856
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,870
Look at where you are, look at what you have.

857
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:52,722
I'm so jealous you have a life.

858
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,808
You have a life too.

859
00:36:53,968 --> 00:36:55,416
Yeah, just not a very good one.

860
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:56,363
Lane, come on.

861
00:36:56,511 --> 00:36:58,867
You're healthy, you have a band and a boyfriend,

862
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:01,103
and so what if school is boring?

863
00:37:01,273 --> 00:37:03,295
You won't be in school forever. You have a good life.

864
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:04,723
I'm weak.

865
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:06,910
I have no spine.

866
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,132
If you had no spine you'd be walking funny.

867
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,667
I wanna thank you for letting me crash here last night.

868
00:37:11,877 --> 00:37:13,054
Of course, any time.

869
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:14,176
I gotta get going.

870
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:16,423
Do you want to wait till this afternoon?

871
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:18,318
I can give you a ride home when I'm done with classes.

872
00:37:18,573 --> 00:37:21,282
Now. I have to get home. I have to take care of this.

873
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,967
Okay, come on.

874
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:24,339
Where are we going?

875
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:27,601
I can't send you home to Mrs. Kim without a purse full of mini donuts.

876
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,149
You know, I believe that's how Mother Theresa got started.

877
00:37:30,554 --> 00:37:31,885
Really, I heard it was Pixie Stix.

878
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:44,824
Hey, it's Madeleine Albright.

879
00:37:47,614 --> 00:37:48,454
You know what?

880
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,630
I do not appreciate you calling me that.

881
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:54,383
In fact, I don't appreciate you talking to me, or about me at all.

882
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:56,349
- Fine. 
- I know you've been telling the story.

883
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:57,338
What story?

884
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,301
The laundry room story. Remember the laundry room?

885
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,059
Machines, rinse cycle...

886
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:03,727
I asked you to get coffee, that's it.

887
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:06,287
I did not ask you to get married, or say that I loved you,

888
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:09,621
or ask to have your children. And I'm not stalking you!

889
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:12,329
It was a complete coincidence that I happened to go into a meeting

890
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,997
that you happened to be in. I had no idea you were there.

891
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,978
And it's hard to ask someone out and it puts you in an incredibly vulnerable position!

892
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:23,551
So, it's cruel to use that incident as a funny cocktail story.

893
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:26,531
So from now on, I would appreciate it if you would refrain from telling

894
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,403
the hilarious laundry room incident to anyone, anywhere, ever again.

895
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:32,661
I wasn't talking about you.

896
00:38:34,883 --> 00:38:35,713
What?

897
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:37,811
There was this girl from the third floor,

898
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,638
she asked me out like a 100 times. She followed me to class.

899
00:38:40,756 --> 00:38:42,768
She baked me a cake every day for a month,

900
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:46,198
then she snuck in my window and hid in my closet, covered in whipped cream.

901
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,659
Oh, that is a little … extreme.

902
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:51,628
I didn't tell anybody about the laundry room.

903
00:38:51,901 --> 00:38:54,318
Well, good.

904
00:38:56,227 --> 00:39:00,221
Do you think that you could maybe not tell anyone this story also,

905
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:03,580
'cause, that would be great. Thanks.

906
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:54,981
Is this all?

907
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:11,186
That's all.

908
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,847
I'm sorry.

909
00:40:16,342 --> 00:40:17,300
About what?

910
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:18,851
I'm sorry about last night.

911
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:21,595
I don't want to keep secrets from you.

912
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:22,799
You don't?

913
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:27,011
My band had this amazing chance

914
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:30,202
to play this really famous club last night

915
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:32,946
and I didn't know how to tell you about it.

916
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,651
I knew you wouldn't approve,

917
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:37,395
you wouldn't approve of me being in the band

918
00:40:37,574 --> 00:40:39,864
or the music we were playing

919
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,289
and I can't even imagine what you would have said

920
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:45,976
if I had asked you to let me stay out 'til four in the morning.

921
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:47,144
I would have said no.

922
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:49,950
Well, then I guess I could have imagined it after all.

923
00:40:50,524 --> 00:40:51,347
How long?

924
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:52,576
How long what?

925
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:54,697
How long … this.

926
00:40:56,396 --> 00:40:58,537
I started it when I was six,

927
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:04,004
the day you told me the Cookie Monster was one of the seven deadly sins.

928
00:41:04,112 --> 00:41:06,641
- Gluttony. 
- Yes, gluttony.

929
00:41:07,128 --> 00:41:09,524
So, I made you do this?

930
00:41:09,656 --> 00:41:10,661
No, I just...

931
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:15,908
I want to please you so badly, but I can't.

932
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,097
I mean, look at you, look at what happened last night.

933
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:24,577
It's not good. I don't want anything like this to ever happen again.

934
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:27,879
I've been thinking a lot about this, our situation,

935
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:31,172
and I think I figured out a way to make everything better.

936
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,109
You have?

937
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:34,985
I don't want to go to Seventh Day Adventist College anymore.

938
00:41:36,148 --> 00:41:39,644
I want to be able to play with my band. I want to be a drummer.

939
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:43,625
I will happily go to community college, and I will happily live at home

940
00:41:43,741 --> 00:41:47,893
and adhere to your curfew, except on the nights when the band plays or practices.

941
00:41:48,104 --> 00:41:50,617
This way, I can get what I want

942
00:41:50,797 --> 00:41:53,326
and I won't be lying to you or sneaking around.

943
00:41:53,448 --> 00:41:55,061
This way we can both be happy.

944
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:57,887
Children do not make the rules.

945
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:04,273
You may… move out and live like that somewhere else.

946
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:14,503
I think you handled that very well.

947
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:17,047
- I was so humiliated. 
- You didn't know.

948
00:42:17,145 --> 00:42:20,576
How self-centered am I that I just assumed that he was talking about me?

949
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:23,134
I would have assumed the same thing, so, incredibly self-centered.

950
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:26,519
All I know is I can't show my face in International Relations Club again,

951
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:29,571
or the laundry room, or the dining room, or anywhere.

952
00:42:29,678 --> 00:42:32,808
Hey, if that nut job who jumped out of his closet Reddi-Whipped

953
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:34,281
is still hanging around, I think you're fine.

954
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:35,582
- Hey, it's 4:00. 
- So?

955
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:38,218
- Where are the bells? 
- They... stopped.

956
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:39,436
What happened?

957
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:41,757
I don't know, they just haven't been working all day.

958
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:43,057
Oh. Too bad.

959
00:42:43,225 --> 00:42:44,828
Yeah, ain't it though.

960
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,113
Someone's at the door. Call me tomorrow.

961
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,019
You bet.

962
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:50,132
- You okay? 
- Yeah, why?

963
00:42:50,393 --> 00:42:51,929
You just sound a little distracted.

964
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:55,448
Do I? No, I'm good, I just didn't get much sleep last night, that's all.

965
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:57,387
- Okay, see you later. 
- Bye.

966
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:01,781
What are you doing here?

967
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:03,994
Well, funny you should ask.
