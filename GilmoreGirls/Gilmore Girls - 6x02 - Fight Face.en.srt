1
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:05,694
It's big.

2
00:00:05,776 --> 00:00:06,793
That's what she said.

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:08,481
- Good one.
- Hey, I'm still 12.

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,798
But I meant the house. It's very big.

5
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:12,972
And very sweet of Luke to
have that dream of his.

6
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:14,293
You two living in this house?

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,395
What do you think there are, 12 rooms?

8
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:17,248
At least.

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,411
You could go to town in this place.

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,052
You could have a dedicated sewing room.

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,398
I mean, that's a no-brainer.

12
00:00:22,476 --> 00:00:24,485
I could put a whole loom
in one of those rooms,

13
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:26,810
indulge my long-harbored desire
to make tapestries.

14
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,079
You've been long-harboring that one?

15
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:29,636
I just thought of it, but, yeah.

16
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:31,804
So, it's all feeling good, huh?

17
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:34,031
Well, it's a little on the Versailles side.

18
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:36,447
I'm gonna have to keep an eye
out for peasants with pitchforks.

19
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:37,921
I meant the relationship.

20
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:39,587
You're engaged, for gosh sakes.

21
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,129
Yes, I'm aware.

22
00:00:41,202 --> 00:00:41,993
And it's sticking?

23
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,529
Yes, Sookie, it's sticking.

24
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:45,640
Good, good.

25
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:47,067
How about now?

26
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:48,874
I'm totally re-evaluating the whole thing.

27
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:49,954
- Really?
- No!

28
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:52,135
- Well, you've got priors.
- Sookie.

29
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:54,118
You say one thing,
but your heart says another.

30
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:55,891
Please, don't give me the whole litany,

31
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:58,348
especially one that sounds
like a Kenny Chesney song.

32
00:00:58,405 --> 00:00:59,671
I'm just being honest.

33
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:01,251
I'm not going to bolt.

34
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:03,436
I'm staying put.

35
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:06,084
Good, because the eyes will give you away.

36
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:06,707
What do you mean?

37
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:09,950
If you think of bolting, they'll pop
out on you like that runaway bride.

38
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:12,479
It's like the eyes are trying
to run away first.

39
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:13,682
Sookie, look at my eyes.

40
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,075
Okay.

41
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:16,175
How do they look?

42
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:18,030
Pretty socked in there.

43
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:19,732
And there they will remain.

44
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,297
Everything's good. Promise.

45
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,257
Good.

46
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:24,193
- Pretty eyes, too.
- I'm taken.

47
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:25,536
- Sorry.
- Whoa.

48
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:27,231
- What? - Is
it me or...

49
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:29,923
Nope. I think it just got bigger.

50
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,637
That's what she said. Good grief.

51
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:33,312
What, you can be 12, but I can't be 12?

52
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,430
- No, you can be 12.
- Thank you.

53
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:30,336
Remember to sign in at the get-go.

54
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:32,855
If you do not sign in,
your work that day will not count

55
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:35,467
against your community-service hours,
so do it.

56
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,725
Same thing at the end.

57
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,880
Sign out. Don't forget.

58
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,393
Each shift is three and a half hours.

59
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:44,287
Double shifts will include
a half-hour lunch break,

60
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,742
and it's bring your own.

61
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:47,491
Take one down and pass it around.

62
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:49,927
These are your guidelines.

63
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,151
They outline safety procedures,
behavior requirements, et cetera.

64
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:57,708
If you cause any trouble,
you will come back here to see me,

65
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,829
something I do not want to happen.

66
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:02,015
Now, let's talk about what
you will not bring.

67
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,551
First on the list...
weapons of any kind.

68
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:07,742
I'll state the obvious first.
You will not bring a gun.

69
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,481
You will not bring chains. You
will not bring knives of any kind,

70
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:14,258
including penknives, nail files,
razor blades, carpet cutters.

71
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:15,632
You will not bring rope.

72
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:19,096
You will not bring brass knuckles or
anything that can be used as a truncheon.

73
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,616
And they have those flashlight thingies...

74
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,797
That's the right name for
those... flashlight thingies.

75
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:26,237
...And Jedi powers of mind control, and
they can move things, so they're telekinetic.

76
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:28,503
And they hover on their jet
saucers over molten lava,

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,195
and they can jump and fly like
they're in cirque du soleil.

78
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,082
Ah, coffee, please.

79
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:34,557
But what gives one Jedi knight
the edge over the other, huh?

80
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,690
The ultimate advantage.

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,991
They stand on a mound of dirt and declare,
"you can't win. I've got the high ground."

82
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:43,558
Dude, if he said it, that's the
way it is. It's a fictional world.

83
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:46,380
He's four feet up a little slope.
That wipes out the other guys' powers

84
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:49,571
to fly, jump around, move things with
his brain, use his flashlight thingy?

85
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:52,312
You've got to learn the right
term for that flashlight thingy.

86
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:53,514
This has been bugging me.

87
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:55,582
For months... we saw
that movie months ago.

88
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,557
You've got to let it go.

89
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:57,341
I can't.

90
00:03:57,426 --> 00:03:59,671
George Lucas owns San Francisco now.

91
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,635
That's a city.
You can't argue with a man who owns a city.

92
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:05,008
All the other guy has to do is
scurry onto land, run up a hill a bit,

93
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,389
and then he has the high ground.

94
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,524
I mean, they can fly jetpods,
but they can't scurry?

95
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,420
Go on a website or something, okay?

96
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:13,617
'Cause there are thousands... no,
millions of your kind out there

97
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:16,712
debating all the minutiae of
not just this "Star Wars" movie,

98
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,269
but every "Star Wars" movie.

99
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:19,886
You drag me to see these movies.

100
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,034
No, you wanted to see that movie.

101
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:23,070
So I can't critique it because
I wanted to see it?

102
00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:24,284
That's how it works.

103
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,682
What about "Bewitched"?

104
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,900
Okay, I'm sorry.

105
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:28,579
They screwed up "Bewitched."

106
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:30,292
Nicole Kidman... good
choice, but that concept?

107
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,351
You should go on a website.

108
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:34,713
No, but "Bewitched" is iconic
...Dr. Bombay, Larry Tate.

109
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,925
There was no Larry Tate.

110
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,835
Hey, let it go. We saw this months ago.

111
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:40,164
This is different.

112
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:42,797
You can't have "Bewitched"
without Larry Tate.

113
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,001
Here's your coffee.

114
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:46,473
So, should we stop going to movies?

115
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:47,608
We should stop caring.

116
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,976
- Okay. Bye, doll.
- Bye.

117
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,189
Do you see these?

118
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:01,384
Yeah, I saw them before, T.J.

119
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:03,792
Stop doing that. It's creepy.

120
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:05,585
Some of my best work
...these shelves.

121
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:07,123
They seem very shelfy.

122
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:08,348
You're not excited.

123
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,685
I tend not to get too excited
about things like shelves.

124
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,613
I hate that you lost the little boy in you.

125
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,611
Don't cry for me.

126
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:18,973
By the way, I'm throwing in my top shelf as
an engagement gift for you, brother-in-law.

127
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:19,821
Great, thanks.

128
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,458
Of course, my per-shelf rate's
gone up since we last talked,

129
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,099
so it all comes out to the same money.

130
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,455
Yeah, well, funny how that works.

131
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:28,390
It's exciting that Lorelai's
gonna be my sister-in-law.

132
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:32,016
Having another hot girl in the
family is gonna be très cool.

133
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:32,713
Uh-huh.

134
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:37,001
People are really gonna stare when the two of
us are squiring our delectable wives around.

135
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:41,469
I don't know just how much mutual
squiring you and I are going to be doing.

136
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,699
You got to admit our wives are hot.

137
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,000
Va-va to the voom.

138
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:48,535
T.J., your wife is my sister.

139
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,310
That don't make you blind, does it?

140
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,292
- Va-va... - Don't
go to the voom again.

141
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,510
Mr. Sensitive.

142
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,331
You're done here, right?
Don't you have somewhere to go?

143
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:58,359
I'm pretty free. I was gonna go
home and watch "Bewitched" on DVD,

144
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,142
but your woman spoiled that for me.

145
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:02,289
I got to check something in the storeroom.

146
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:03,071
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

147
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:06,078
Wait. Wait. Wait.
I need your okay on something.

148
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:07,863
As long as it doesn't involve my sister.

149
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,757
It pays to advertise, right?

150
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,028
I want to put a sign up on the shelves
to let people know who did them.

151
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:14,856
"Shelves by A.J."

152
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:16,718
A.J? Why A.J? Why not T.J?

153
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,684
'Cause I'm going in the yellow
pages, and I want to be up at the top.

154
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:23,441
"T" puts me after everything except
"U", "V", "W", "X", "Y" and "Z"

155
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:24,854
and I think a few others.

156
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:25,616
Smart, huh?

157
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,560
Yeah, I just don't want you
advertising here, T.J.

158
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,964
Well, is it okay if I give out
my card to any inquiring party?

159
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:33,841
Sure, if they inquire, give them a card.

160
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:37,879
You crossed out "Ralph's Shoe Repair"
and wrote in "A.J. Construction."

161
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:39,017
That's your card?

162
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:43,066
I don't have cards, so I take them from other
businesses and write my own stuff in it.

163
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:46,450
You might want to cross out the
picture of the guy shining the boot.

164
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,533
It might confuse things.

165
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:48,161
Thanks.

166
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:49,538
What a team, huh?

167
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:51,465
What a team?

168
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:53,944
How about those shelves, huh?

169
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:56,298
You plus your fat cousins could sit on them.

170
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,531
They wouldn't break.

171
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:58,816
They're that strong.

172
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,256
Here, take a card.

173
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:09,121
Hello, Porky.
Hello. O-h-h-h.

174
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,094
Well, I'm feeling a little guilty
because of the you-L.T. I had yesterday.

175
00:07:13,164 --> 00:07:14,524
That's right, I'm sorry.

176
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:15,630
Please forgive me.

177
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:20,507
Hi, fellas. What's up?
You both look like killers.

178
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:24,395
Hey. Hey, you.

179
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:26,990
Oh, someone seems very happy.

180
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:28,573
He likes you, and he's picky.

181
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,196
He's cute. You're cute.

182
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:31,639
You're shaggy cute.

183
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,975
Oh, we got a love thing going on, don't we?

184
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:35,891
What are you doing?

185
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,841
I'm just enjoying the animals, Patty.

186
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:39,213
Honey, this is not right.

187
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,692
She can't have a love thing with a dog.

188
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:41,492
She can't?

189
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,775
Yes, I can.
Go about your business there, Patty.

190
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,799
You must have her name on some
blacklist back there, don't you?

191
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:48,202
We don't have a blacklist.

192
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:49,987
But this is Lorelai Gilmore.

193
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:51,193
Ignore her.

194
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:52,253
This dog loves me.

195
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,868
And the pig...
the pig loved me.

196
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,080
It looks dead.

197
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,827
It's sleeping. They sleep, right?

198
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,131
Actually, that's very unusual
for her to be sleeping.

199
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,761
Meg, make sure the pig's okay.

200
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:02,363
Yeah, the pig's fine.

201
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:03,551
You didn't touch it, did you?

202
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,733
I did not kill the pig, Patty.

203
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,041
You got a bad record. You got to admit it.

204
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:10,326
That thing with the hamster was a
long time ago. It was a long time ago!

205
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:14,839
And it was only a hamster. It's not in the
same category as dog or pig, now, is it?

206
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:15,832
What about the rabbit?

207
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:18,477
Okay, the rabbit was sick when I
got it. It was sick when I got it.

208
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,629
It was very humanitarian of me
to take it in the first place.

209
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:24,404
And that poor turtle.
It was supposed to outlive you.

210
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:27,073
You're really kind of bringing
down the pet fair here, Patty.

211
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,500
Honey, go see "March of the Penguins."

212
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,183
That's really as close to the
animals as you should get.

213
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:34,588
She's a comedienne, that one.

214
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,261
She just gets a bit,
and then she keeps on going, you know,

215
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:39,317
even with one that's
not funny. It's a...

216
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:43,512
Hi. See you later, kiddo.

217
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,347
- Lorelai!
- Liz, hi.

218
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:50,087
- You and Luke engaged!
- Yes, we are!

219
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,538
- I want to eat your face.
- Is that good?

220
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:56,686
You're my sister-in-law, Mrs. Danes
...not that you're changing your name.

221
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:58,316
You don't got to. Go modern.

222
00:08:58,383 --> 00:08:59,729
Oh, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.

223
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,158
This ring.

224
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,357
- My brother has good taste.
- Yes, he does.

225
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,836
- You ever see my ring? It's a beaut, huh?
- Definitely.

226
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:08,160
Had a problem for a while.
It turned my finger green.

227
00:09:08,237 --> 00:09:10,043
Well, that's common with metal.

228
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,643
No, it's worse than that. The finger turned
green, then it turned blue, then purple.

229
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:16,593
So, I went to this doctor,
and he's talking amputation.

230
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,394
Oh, my god.

231
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:20,494
But T.J. picked it out for me, so I love it,
I really do.

232
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:21,627
It's the thought that counts.

233
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,210
Well, I got to get going.

234
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,891
I actually have a finger-therapy
session I have to go to.

235
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,305
Sister-in-laws!

236
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,867
Sister-in-laws!

237
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:30,913
- Oh, I'm a jerk.
- What?

238
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,385
I forgot to ask you about Rory.

239
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,515
Right.

240
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:36,347
So, is she staying here with
you during the summer break?

241
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:38,181
Oh, well,
actually...

242
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:39,492
Luke didn't tell you about all this?

243
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,463
All what?

244
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:42,690
She's staying with her grandparents
for the summer.

245
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:43,364
Really?

246
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:48,128
For a change of pace,
and she'll be working and, yeah.

247
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:50,414
Your whole
extended family...

248
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:53,822
you, your parents...
so close. It's nice.

249
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:54,944
Yes, it is.

250
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:55,602
Ow.

251
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:56,079
What?

252
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,812
My finger. Got to run, bye.

253
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,631
Uh... bye, Liz.

254
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:05,723
I'll take him.

255
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:07,331
So the 14th works?

256
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,576
Yeah, works for me.

257
00:10:08,661 --> 00:10:10,867
My god, we're busier than that Anne Coulter.

258
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:11,325
Who?

259
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,941
That blond bean pole on TV.

260
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:15,066
If she walked over a subway grate,
she'd fall through.

261
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:16,358
We need to talk to the gardener.

262
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:17,806
Try. I've given up.

263
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,143
I told him to take that mp3 device off
his head while he worked, and he did.

264
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,699
Then I hid behind the curtains, and he
put his mp3 device right back in his ears.

265
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,556
We're paying him too much if
he's able to afford an mp3 device.

266
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:29,346
He's got to focus on the lawn.

267
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:30,509
- Morning, honey.
- Hi.

268
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:31,921
The patches of brown.

269
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:33,323
- Good morning, Rory.
- Good morning.

270
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,942
Speaking of which, we have a
cocktail gathering on Wednesday.

271
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,797
How was "patches of brown" speaking of which?

272
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:39,988
- It's the sterling-olivers.
- The age spots.

273
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,050
You worship the sun, you pay the price.

274
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:45,451
So, Wednesday with the
Oliv... wait a minute.

275
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:47,763
We have cocktails with the
Bransons on Wednesday.

276
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,296
We'll do a drink at each.

277
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:50,535
We've done it before.

278
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:52,334
- Rory, sit, sit.
- Okay.

279
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,964
We're staying on top of your car, by the way.

280
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,636
My car?

281
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:56,126
It's still in the shop.

282
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:57,222
What is with our government?

283
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:59,684
Impounding a car and damaging
it in the process.

284
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,379
Then refusing to pay for the damage.

285
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:03,214
I should tell Scooter Libby about this.

286
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,810
I keep forgetting I know a man on the inside.

287
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:06,725
I'll give him a call.

288
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:08,097
Before an indictment comes down.

289
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,095
I'm sorry.

290
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:09,721
For what?

291
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:12,534
My car was impounded because
of the thing with the yacht.

292
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,408
That's forgotten.

293
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:14,432
Totally forgotten.

294
00:11:14,492 --> 00:11:15,186
It didn't happen.

295
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:16,713
We'll get you through this community service.

296
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,055
Then we'll be through with the matter.

297
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:19,664
Was the orientation horrible?

298
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,771
No, it went fine.
I start my first hours in a couple days.

299
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,346
You're bearing this angelically.

300
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:25,676
Oh, I've got to run!

301
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:27,229
Oh, look at that. Me too.

302
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:29,178
Goodbye, Rory. Have a nice day.

303
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:30,884
- Eat the rest of this.
- I'll try.

304
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:33,063
And give the fabric samples in
the pool house a good look.

305
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:35,545
- The longer we wait, the longer it takes.
- I'll give him a good look.

306
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:37,439
- What's that?
- It's my new ringtone.

307
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,686
I love it.

308
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,883
I'll have Katie come up with
some suggestions for yours.

309
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:43,136
Maybe some Burt Bacharach.

310
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,129
Wonderful.

311
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:52,062
May I?

312
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:53,453
Sí.

313
00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:58,913
Esperanza, right?

314
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,451
Sí, Esperanza.

315
00:13:04,774 --> 00:13:07,652
Tu nombre es muy bonito.

316
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,619
¿Hablas espaÑol?

317
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:15,074
Um, no hablo bien, y no hablo mucho.

318
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,699
Lo hablas muy bien.

319
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,311
¿De dónde eres?

320
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:20,636
De Guatemala.

321
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:21,829
Guatemala.

322
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,203
¿Tienes familia allí?

323
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:28,808
Oh, sí, tengo mucha familia,
y quiero traer a mi mam* aquí.

324
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,027
Oh, sí.

325
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,086
¿Y cu*ntos aÑos tiene tu mam*?

326
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,786
72 aÑos.

327
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:35,594
Oh.

328
00:13:36,786 --> 00:13:40,969
¿Le gusta ver fútbol en la televisión
o le gusta jugar?

329
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:41,947
Rory!

330
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,290
Oh, grandma, you scared me.

331
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,536
Hello, Mrs. Gilmore.

332
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:46,773
What is going on here?

333
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,497
Um, we were just...

334
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,526
well, we were polishing silver.

335
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:53,903
Esperanza, the vacuum is still
sitting in the foyer.

336
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,072
The vacuum.

337
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:57,676
The vacuum!

338
00:13:57,748 --> 00:13:59,681
Oh, sí! Sí.

339
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,487
Tell me she didn't ask you to help.

340
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:05,441
Oh, no, no. She
didn't. I just...

341
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:08,573
I don't know.
I just thought I would pitch in.

342
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,306
Well, you shouldn't. This is her job.
She's paid to do this.

343
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:12,233
I know.

344
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,405
And what was that language?

345
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,321
Spanish.

346
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,285
Spanish?

347
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:17,653
They don't like it when
you talk to them, Rory.

348
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:19,044
She seemed fine.

349
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,708
Is that a bathing suit?

350
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:23,711
Yeah. Yeah, I was gonna go swimming earlier.

351
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,373
In fact, I think I'll go do that now.

352
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,326
Yes, a swim would be good.

353
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:30,985
Okay, well, see you later.

354
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:40,515
Hey, you ready to go?

355
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,296
Come in, come in.
I want to show you something.

356
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:43,130
Okay.

357
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:45,772
Or, more accurately,
I want to show you someone.

358
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,000
Ta-da!

359
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:48,256
- Where'd he go?
- Where'd who go?

360
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,180
What's all this crap?

361
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:50,862
Oh, yoo-hoo!

362
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,889
Come on, dude.
We had it all rehearsed and everything.

363
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,340
Aha! Ha ha.

364
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:56,418
Yeah. Okay.

365
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:57,810
Ta-da!

366
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,945
It's a dog.

367
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,751
Yeah, very good. He's smart, too.
Not as smart as you.

368
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:02,895
What are you doing with a dog?

369
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,503
I bought him. Doesn't he look happy?

370
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:06,251
Yeah, I guess. You bought a dog.

371
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:09,375
Yeah, and he loves me,
and he doesn't give his love easily.

372
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,424
The only drawback is the name
...Cocoa. It's too cutesy.

373
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:15,986
But he's a rescue, so I don't want to freak
him out by giving him a new name right away.

374
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:18,594
So, I'm gonna get to the name
I want in baby steps.

375
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,766
For the first week, I'll call
him Cocoa to get him acclimated.

376
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:21,447
Acclimated.

377
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,018
The second week, I'm gonna call him Cokey.

378
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:24,947
Third week... Kooky.
Fourth week... Tooky.

379
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,963
So, you're gonna name him Tooky?

380
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:30,142
I'm gonna name him Paul Anka, but it's
gonna take a while to get to Paul Anka.

381
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:31,489
Yeah, I'd say so.

382
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:35,708
And, you know, this little guy has
already taught me something I didn't know.

383
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,517
Just because they make it for a dog
doesn't mean a dog is gonna like it.

384
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:44,364
Toys, including squeakies
and the "whazzup" variety...

385
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:45,798
- Whazzup?
- No interest.

386
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:48,517
Rawhide bones... no interest.
Popcorn... scared of it.

387
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,699
Scared of popcorn?

388
00:15:49,771 --> 00:15:54,018
Yeah, and also of tissue holders,
paperbacks, CDs, framed pictures, and lint.

389
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:57,082
Oh, and when I drink something, he
gets freaked out like I'm gonna die,

390
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:59,940
and I have to pick him up and rock
him like a baby until he calms down.

391
00:16:00,011 --> 00:16:01,164
It's been quite a first day for us.

392
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,267
Look, should I ask the question
that immediately came to mind
when I first saw the thing,

393
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:05,655
or should I just shut up?

394
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:06,412
No, shoot.

395
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:10,158
- Is it okay for you... - That
hamster was defective, period.

396
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,400
Plus, they only live like three
years. I looked it up, and...

397
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:15,550
and... and he would have
been dead by now anyway.

398
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:17,337
So, world, stop with the hamster already.

399
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,232
- But the turtle... - The
same thing with the turtle.

400
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:20,452
Yeah, but they live to be 90.

401
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,821
I will take care of this dog, I promise.

402
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:23,903
Would you like a beer?

403
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,670
Sure.

404
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:26,596
Okay. Just distract him while I'm drinking.

405
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:28,656
And don't let him see the... bottle opener.

406
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:33,258
How much did you spend on all this?

407
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:34,024
Tons.

408
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,410
For a stupid dog.

409
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:37,014
You're acting like you don't like dogs.

410
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,110
I don't like dogs.

411
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:39,553
Shh! He heard you.

412
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:40,572
He speaks English?

413
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,360
Since when do you not like dogs?

414
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:44,904
Since all the times I made that really,
really clear,

415
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:47,897
which is every time I've
ever been around a dog.

416
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:49,792
What is there not to like about dogs?

417
00:16:49,937 --> 00:16:53,192
They're dirty, they're a pain
to train, they're a pain to wash,

418
00:16:53,268 --> 00:16:56,209
they bark when they shouldn't, they
jump on you when you don't want them to,

419
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:58,748
they chew things, they shed,
they lick themselves,

420
00:16:58,804 --> 00:17:01,286
they make your house smell,
they make your car smell,

421
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:03,174
and they make you smell.

422
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,542
I think it's sad that you've
lost the little boy in you.

423
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,472
The little boy didn't like dogs, either.

424
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,253
Oh, you know, I just realized what this is.

425
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,774
- This is our thing.
- What thing?

426
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:15,411
This tradition of ours. You
claim to hate everything at first,

427
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:18,031
but it's just your initial
stance in a negotiation,

428
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,567
and then we talk, and our opinions merge,

429
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:21,946
and we find a happy middle.

430
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:26,380
No, a lot of times, it's just how
I feel, and my mind doesn't change.

431
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,204
Okay, he's eating.

432
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,173
Come on, let's go.

433
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:31,227
But don't make any sudden movements
and don't drink and don't look at him.

434
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:32,760
He's very self-conscious about his eating.

435
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:35,387
I'm the same way.
That's how I know this is gonna work.

436
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:36,842
Go. Go, go, go.

437
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:46,390
You do realize your dog has just
driven us out of the house?

438
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:47,810
Don't worry. He's a quick eater.

439
00:17:48,046 --> 00:17:48,770
Come on.

440
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:53,336
Shh.

441
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:54,286
This is silly.

442
00:17:54,363 --> 00:17:56,512
What? We can hang out out here.
It's a nice night.

443
00:17:58,557 --> 00:17:59,564
Okay.

444
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:01,103
Now, fill me in.

445
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:02,372
How was your day?

446
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,565
I talked to some contractors
about the Twickham house.

447
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:06,460
Oh, yeah?

448
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,233
As soon as we make the offer,
they'll let us in.

449
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,619
And we can start planning stuff,
remodeling, whatever.

450
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:12,255
Good.

451
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:13,968
And as soon as we're out of escrow,
we can start work.

452
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:15,022
Cool, excellent.

453
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:18,754
We could pull the crew here, do
some touch-ups before selling.

454
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:20,435
Wait. Touch-ups? Where, here?

455
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,235
It hasn't been painted in a while.
Fixing it up will help it sell.

456
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:25,090
Right. You know, I've been thinking?

457
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:26,063
What?

458
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,901
Maybe we should hang on to this house.

459
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:29,568
To rent?

460
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:30,828
No, not to rent.

461
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:32,802
To use in some other way.

462
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:33,742
What other way?

463
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,801
Uh, I don't know. It could be, like,
a paint studio.

464
00:18:36,873 --> 00:18:37,628
We don't paint.

465
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:39,289
Well, maybe we'll start.

466
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:42,717
Maybe it's the lack of a studio that's kept
us from realizing our love of watercolors.

467
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,830
I don't have a love of watercolors.

468
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:48,668
Or I could use it as my recording studio.

469
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,746
That would be cool, huh?

470
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,212
And when I'm not laying down tracks,
I could rent it out

471
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:56,046
to Korn or Iggy Pop or someone.

472
00:18:56,349 --> 00:19:00,707
Right? You and me just hanging with Iggy Pop,
rocking out,

473
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,883
telling stories. Ig's got stories.

474
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,610
Uh-huh.

475
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:06,721
Or we could use it as a safe house

476
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,819
in case we decide to take up a life of crime.

477
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,792
I doubt we're going to do that.

478
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,277
We could be wrongly accused of
a crime we did not commit.

479
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:16,184
Then we'd have to hide out until
society realized the mistake,

480
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:20,080
and then we'd be like,
"hey, no hard feelings. It happens.

481
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:23,641
"This is a great country, and
thank god we had the safe house."

482
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:25,877
If you want,
we can just hang on to it and rent it out.

483
00:19:25,952 --> 00:19:28,037
I don't want anyone else living in it.

484
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:30,663
They can't live in it,
but they can record songs in it?

485
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:32,453
I just think we could use this place.

486
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,323
Think about it, okay?

487
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:36,734
Yeah, sure, we'll think about it.

488
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:37,696
Okay.

489
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,680
Oh, look, he's done,

490
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,750
and he's in there fast asleep.

491
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,727
Great, let's go back in.

492
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,806
Just be careful because he gets
scared when you wake him up.

493
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:48,623
Of course.

494
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:52,806
Okay. Oh, and try not to say any
words that begin with the letter "Q."

495
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:02,023
Hi, I got your note.

496
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:03,289
Come in, dear.

497
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:04,978
We just wanted to speak to you for a minute.

498
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:06,475
Sit, sit.

499
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,730
We have a club soda all ready for you here.

500
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,657
Is that all right?
We can make you something else.

501
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:14,056
No, that's fine. My drink of choice,
thank you.

502
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,514
Refreshing.

503
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:27,262
Now, you said something before
about wanting a job.

504
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,017
Yes.

505
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,858
You're low on money,
and I know you'd prefer to earn it

506
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,166
rather than be given
it... you're a Gilmore.

507
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,019
Your grandmother and I are ready
to help you with that.

508
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:37,578
- With a job?
- That's right.

509
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:41,555
Well, um,
the job thing was before my court thing.

510
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,630
300 hours of community
service in 6 months...

511
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:46,944
it's a full-time job in itself,

512
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,518
which kind of limits my
options as far as work.

513
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:50,917
That's where we come in.

514
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:54,848
We can swing a couple of options for you
that'll give you the flexibility you need.

515
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:55,465
Really?

516
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,694
There are all sorts of things out there
for a bright girl such as yourself.

517
00:20:58,782 --> 00:21:00,703
They'll bend their schedules for you.

518
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:03,222
I'll make some appointments and
let you know what they are.

519
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:05,586
All right. Well, thank you.

520
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,184
Thank you very much.

521
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:08,482
Have you met Draguta?

522
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,192
She's from Romania.

523
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,128
Hi.

524
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:29,709
That's right. I forgot.

525
00:21:29,818 --> 00:21:31,199
You don't like the stairs.

526
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:32,443
Come on, Paul Anka.

527
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:34,747
That's right.

528
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,507
I'm skipping the fancy in-between
thing and going straight for the gold.

529
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:41,161
I'm calling you Paul Anka, Paul Anka the dog.

530
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:47,452
Oh, excuse me.

531
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:50,877
Rory, what a coincidence.
We were talking about you earlier.

532
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:51,550
You were?

533
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:53,071
Come in. Sit with us for a minute.

534
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:54,201
This is Rory?

535
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:55,620
She's made of porcelain.

536
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,249
I didn't mean to interrupt.

537
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:58,416
Beautiful skin.

538
00:21:58,505 --> 00:21:59,805
Like one of your Iladros.

539
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:01,931
I want to miniaturize her
and set her on my mantel.

540
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:03,279
You've interrupted nothing.

541
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:05,334
Nora was just defending her choice.

542
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:06,306
Her choice?

543
00:22:06,446 --> 00:22:07,514
Cover your ears, Rory.

544
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:09,416
It's Alexander Hamilton, no debate.

545
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:10,598
Over Washington.

546
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:11,540
And Jefferson.

547
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:15,847
Direct, proud,
that chin and those blazing eyes.

548
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,486
They're discussing the forefathers.

549
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:18,972
Choosing, to be more accurate.

550
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:20,452
Which was the greatest?

551
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:21,234
Lover.

552
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,128
Oh, dear.

553
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:24,225
Girls, please. She's just a child.

554
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:26,779
Most of us picked Washington or Jefferson.

555
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:29,197
There was one vote for James Madison.

556
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:30,291
Two abstentions.

557
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,717
And I chose the stud on the 10.

558
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:35,642
It's the drinks.
I have to start watering them down.

559
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,569
So, we finally meet the famous Rory.

560
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:38,391
I'm famous?

561
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:39,244
You're wanted.

562
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:40,641
She's perfect for us.

563
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:41,463
For what?

564
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:44,677
A job's opened up at our D.A.R.
office downtown.

565
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,088
We need someone smart, sharp-looking.

566
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,936
And the hours are extremely flexible.

567
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:51,667
It just fell into our laps.
Isn't that something?

568
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,403
Yes.

569
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:55,226
You can even work from home.
It's mostly phone work.

570
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,096
You'd be perfect for us.

571
00:22:57,188 --> 00:23:01,148
Well, thank you all for thinking of
me, and, yes, it does sound perfect.

572
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:01,614
Good.

573
00:23:01,678 --> 00:23:03,294
When did you join, Rory?

574
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:04,040
Join?

575
00:23:04,113 --> 00:23:05,446
The D.A.R.

576
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,556
Oh, well, I haven't.

577
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:08,223
Yet.

578
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:10,352
She'd have to join to work in the office.

579
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:11,181
Oh.

580
00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:14,983
Don't worry. The term "shoo-in"
was coined for a figurine like you.

581
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,293
Don't worry.
The paperwork's all filled out and ready.

582
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:18,087
It's a formality.

583
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:19,589
Do you not eat? Do you not drink?

584
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:21,559
The Irish coffee is astounding.

585
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,062
Oh, yes. Rory, our meeting's done.
We're just gabbing.

586
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:25,146
Go change and join us.

587
00:23:25,223 --> 00:23:27,438
And be thinking of the forefather you fancy.

588
00:23:27,515 --> 00:23:29,284
Well, I can't.

589
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,596
Why not?

590
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:33,560
Uh, because I have my, um...

591
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:34,586
Your?

592
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,245
My thing.

593
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:37,734
Your thing.

594
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:41,568
Um... my community service.

595
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:42,838
You were supposed to drive me.

596
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:45,424
Oh, yes. Ladies, I'm sorry.

597
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:46,934
Rory and I have a little outing,

598
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:49,339
and we were having so much filthy
fun I forgot the time.

599
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:50,780
Doing a little shopping, Emily?

600
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:51,904
Something like that.

601
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:52,760
Well, have fun.

602
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,238
Lovely gathering, Emily.

603
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,262
Thank you, girls.

604
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:58,285
Oh, you're going to match the
drapes in our office perfectly.

605
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:07,957
Come on, boy. Jump out.

606
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:11,748
Good boy. You're not afraid of jumping.
That's something.

607
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,554
Uh, excuse me.

608
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

609
00:24:18,254 --> 00:24:20,897
I'm Lorelai,
the owner of the house you're standing on.

610
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:21,951
I'm George.

611
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:23,219
Hi, George.

612
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:26,740
I'm just trying to think of how
to ask this in a polite way.

613
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:29,012
Um, are you committing some sort of crime?

614
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:29,799
No.

615
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,926
But if you were, would you tell me?

616
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:33,696
Hello.

617
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:34,323
Howdy.

618
00:24:34,384 --> 00:24:35,705
Fight or flight? Fight or flight?

619
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:36,419
Hey!

620
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:37,711
Luke.

621
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,236
- This is George.
- Oh, we've met.

622
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:40,573
- I'm Saul.
- Hi, Saul.

623
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:41,969
- Got what you need?
- Just about.

624
00:24:42,037 --> 00:24:43,913
- Saul, did you get what you need?
- Just about.

625
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:47,917
Wow. I was this close to screaming
and siccing the dog on you.

626
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:50,415
How did you get that door closed?

627
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:52,127
We're just about done.

628
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:53,284
Done with what?

629
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:54,872
Sizing the situation.

630
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,972
What situation?

631
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,630
About how many silent joists
we need to carry out.

632
00:24:58,696 --> 00:24:59,421
What's a joist?

633
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:00,805
The things that support the load.

634
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,503
What load?

635
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:02,748
The load from the extension.

636
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:06,277
Okay, this has officially become the worst
first draft of "who's on first?" in history.

637
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,771
It's about enlarging the
bedroom to live here.

638
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:11,146
Here? You want to live here?

639
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:14,154
Sure. I don't have a lot of stuff,
and we just need more closet space,

640
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:15,618
a bigger bathroom, bigger bedroom.

641
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,386
I always wanted a bigger bedroom.

642
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:18,979
Well, it looks like we can do it.

643
00:25:19,212 --> 00:25:20,480
Well, what about the Twickham house?

644
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:21,432
Too damn big.

645
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:23,905
We can get along fine here for a while,
maybe forever.

646
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,383
It's a great house.

647
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:26,315
You love this house.

648
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:27,800
I do love this house.

649
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,727
I figured that out from your sudden interest
in laying down tracks and becoming a painter.

650
00:25:31,783 --> 00:25:34,434
Come down here so I can kiss you, all of you.

651
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:35,819
We'll just be a minute.

652
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:44,382
You locked the door? Dude, come on.

653
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:48,140
I mean, I've got the key, but I'm
really curious how you did this.

654
00:25:56,308 --> 00:25:58,086
Let's see what else.

655
00:25:58,162 --> 00:26:01,051
"When you're eating in the mess hall, never
reach across the prisoner next to you."

656
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,411
It's a provocation.
It'll get you a fork in your hand.

657
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:05,255
I don't think there's going
to be a mess hall.

658
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:07,231
Well, wherever you're eating,
that would apply.

659
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:09,348
What else? "Don't be arrogant."

660
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,679
But you're not arrogant.

661
00:26:10,848 --> 00:26:14,023
"Don't let anyone give you anything
"or lend you anything, period.

662
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,046
It can get you injured or
killed or turned out."

663
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:20,183
I'm not sure what "turned out" means, but
they're very careful to warn you off it.

664
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:20,973
Got it.

665
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:23,879
Now, "if somebody approaches
you with a shiv"...

666
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:25,666
Do you know what a shiv is, grandma?

667
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:26,439
No, what is it?

668
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:28,896
It's like a crude knife,
carved from a soda can.

669
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:33,825
Oh... that must be why they advise you
to "yell for a hack to come help you."

670
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:34,528
What's a hack?

671
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:36,230
Where did you get this, grandma?

672
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:40,111
I had your grandfather's secretary find me
info on interacting with fellow prisoners.

673
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:42,599
But we're not prisoners.
We're just doing community service.

674
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,043
They look like prisoners.

675
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:47,781
Well, you know,
sitting here in the jag staring at them

676
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:49,645
is probably not going to help my popularity.

677
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:52,370
Oh, you're right. That's on the
list, too... staring... it's bad.

678
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:54,523
You shouldn't do it for more
than one or two seconds.

679
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:55,429
I won't.

680
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:58,467
And they emphasize that you "keep
your fight face at home."

681
00:26:58,524 --> 00:27:00,523
I'm guessing that's any sort
of aggressive expression,

682
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:02,522
whether you're staring at the person or not.

683
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:03,834
Fight face...
remember that.

684
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:05,041
Okay. I'll be fine, grandma.

685
00:27:05,113 --> 00:27:06,465
- Thanks for driving me.
- Wait.

686
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:10,480
Here. That's better than a paper bag.

687
00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:11,568
Yes, it is.

688
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:12,714
Oh, and here.

689
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,108
Cigarettes?

690
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,532
To barter. It's currency to these people.

691
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,266
Thank you, grandma.
I'll call you when I'm done.

692
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:21,123
Bye, now. And remember, don't stare.

693
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,693
Anyone want a smoke?

694
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,377
Then you've got to decide on your extras.

695
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,616
We can slap up some molding.

696
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:42,436
Yeah, molding's good. Lorelai will like that.

697
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:44,317
She will. She will like that.

698
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:47,616
Let's figure on molding of some kind.

699
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,799
- Good.
- Good.

700
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:52,881
We can add a wainscot, too, and we could
do a lugged architrave on the overdoor.

701
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:53,425
Great.

702
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:55,630
Oh, I love a lugged architrave.

703
00:27:55,703 --> 00:27:56,427
Liz.

704
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,093
Oh, hi. I'm Liz.

705
00:27:58,164 --> 00:27:59,484
- My sister.
- Hi, Liz.

706
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:01,253
- You're an architect, huh?
- Yep.

707
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,109
How long have you been an architect?

708
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,646
This is not your interview, Liz.

709
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:06,604
Oh, I'm buttoning it now. Sorry.

710
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:07,976
I need to go anyway, Luke.

711
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:09,513
What's your time frame here, George?

712
00:28:09,568 --> 00:28:12,280
It's going to take me at least
two weeks to draw up a plan.

713
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:13,230
I'll keep you posted.

714
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:14,119
Good deal.

715
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:15,424
Good deal, George.

716
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:17,204
I'll talk to you later.

717
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:19,651
What is wrong with you?

718
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,236
I'm just excited about all this.

719
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,433
A new adventure!

720
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:26,068
But it's not your adventure.
It's my adventure.

721
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:28,542
You're in the employee section.

722
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,049
I want to talk to you about something.

723
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:31,783
You've done nothing but talk.

724
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:32,772
Why announce it now?

725
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:35,886
You're going to need a contractor
for your remodel, right?

726
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,494
Yes.

727
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,242
And you know who I'm married to.

728
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:38,975
Yes.

729
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,694
He'd be perfect for this.

730
00:28:40,904 --> 00:28:42,266
T.J? He's not a contractor.

731
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:43,486
Oh, but he is.

732
00:28:43,553 --> 00:28:44,085
Since when?

733
00:28:44,162 --> 00:28:47,915
Since he almost passed the test for
his contractor's license last month.

734
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,193
I mean, he was so close.

735
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:52,561
If he hadn't used all those curse words
during the written exam, he'd have had it.

736
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:53,632
He used curse words?

737
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:56,690
When he's enthusiastic about something,
he gets very foul.

738
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:57,882
But I blame his mother.

739
00:28:57,939 --> 00:29:01,023
She has got a mouth on
her... garbage mouth.

740
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,999
I don't think he can do the job, Liz.

741
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:08,090
Oh, but, my brother,
he's working so hard for his license.

742
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,543
You should see him. It is so cute.

743
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,759
He sits up in bed at night poring
through his books and his manuals.

744
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:17,343
He's got this system where he reads a chapter

745
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:19,343
then rewards himself with a junior mint.

746
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:20,832
It's been working great for him.

747
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,451
There is no way in the world
that he is getting this job, Liz.

748
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,080
But what about the shelves he made you?

749
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:26,996
I thought you liked them.

750
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:28,325
They're just shelves.

751
00:29:28,738 --> 00:29:31,231
Oh, what happened to the little boy in you?

752
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:33,928
Look, the shelves are nice,
but this is a big job.

753
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,935
Lorelai loves this house.

754
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:37,630
This is a great house.

755
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:40,268
- Luke, his life depends on it.
- How?

756
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:44,405
Because if he doesn't get his ass out of
the house and work more, I'm gonna kill him.

757
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:45,927
There's a housing boom out there.

758
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:48,055
There's plenty of work for
a good carpenter like T.J.

759
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:50,851
But every time he interviews for jobs,
he starts cursing.

760
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:52,423
He can't help it.

761
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,823
People mistake it for him
being weird or something.

762
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:55,558
Imagine that.

763
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:57,968
Please, big brother, for your little sister.

764
00:29:58,037 --> 00:29:58,704
Liz.

765
00:29:58,762 --> 00:30:00,479
Just don't say "no."

766
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:01,640
Okay? Just think about it.

767
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:02,906
I don't need to think about it.

768
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:04,513
For me, think about it.

769
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,306
Okay, fine.
I won't say "no" for the time being.

770
00:30:08,394 --> 00:30:10,311
Yes! Thank you.

771
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:13,190
That's all I needed was a big fat
"not a no."

772
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:14,232
Whatever.

773
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:34,686
Sorry.

774
00:30:38,526 --> 00:30:39,205
Oh!

775
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:40,714
Watch it.

776
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,545
Sorry.

777
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,595
So, it's an omelet, a side of bacon.

778
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:22,634
What kind of cheese do you have?

779
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:25,003
I've got your basic
...Swiss, cheddar.

780
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,250
Hey, what?

781
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:27,604
What? Hey.

782
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:28,805
Lorelai, what are you doing?

783
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:29,908
Lorelai?

784
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,605
This is weird, okay?

785
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:34,388
I... come on.
What's wrong?

786
00:31:34,455 --> 00:31:35,740
Lorelai, say something.

787
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:36,644
Hole!

788
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:38,070
- How...
- Hole.

789
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,312
- It...
- Hole!

790
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:40,926
I know it's a hole. How did it happen?

791
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:42,124
- Dirt.
- What?

792
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:44,215
Dirt, bed, dirt. Hole.

793
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:45,377
Speak in sentences, come on.

794
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,363
You found this when you got home.

795
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:49,055
Yes, a big hole!

796
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:50,158
It was sledgehammered.

797
00:31:50,214 --> 00:31:51,925
With a very big sledgehammer.

798
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,212
God, who would...

799
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,538
- Oh, my god.
- What?

800
00:31:57,163 --> 00:31:58,105
- Him.
- Who?

801
00:31:58,156 --> 00:31:59,073
- Him.
- What him?

802
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:00,239
- Kill.
- Kill who?

803
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:01,045
T.J.

804
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,566
- T.J. did this?
- Who else?!

805
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:03,370
What do you mean, "who else"?

806
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:05,908
Why would T.J.
come to my house and sledgehammer my bedroom?

807
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:07,430
- Damn it, Liz!
- What did Liz do?

808
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:11,053
Ah, she worked me over. She begged me to
hire T.J. as the contractor on the remodel.

809
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:13,757
- T.J.'s a contractor?
- No, and I said "no."

810
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:15,328
But she made me promise to think about it.

811
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:17,211
And then she sat in the diner staring at me,

812
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:19,530
and then she started to cry,
so I kicked her out.

813
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:22,562
And then she went outside and cried and
so I could see it through the window.

814
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,957
And I couldn't take it anymore,
so I said, "okay,"

815
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,086
knowing we had weeks to figure
out how to get out of it.

816
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,676
And no work could be done 'cause
George hadn't made up the plans.

817
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:32,103
And, in the meantime, T.J.
could've changed occupations

818
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:36,429
or injured himself bouncing on his
trampoline and backed out of the job.

819
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,355
But how could you risk saying
"okay" to anything with T.J?

820
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:42,203
Did I mention the crying?
Liz is a walking tear duct.

821
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:47,086
Oh, T.J.'s good. You never see what's
coming, like a big, dumb tsunami.

822
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:47,918
He's that good.

823
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:49,158
So, what do we do?

824
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,123
I'm gonna talk to T.J.

825
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,415
But I'm gonna be smart about it,
I'm not gonna spook him.

826
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:56,642
I'm gonna be like Michael Corleone dealing
with that slimy brother-in-law of his.

827
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,099
Get a couple of tickets to a ball game,
invite him along.

828
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,759
We'll talk about the beer and
the hot dogs we're gonna eat.

829
00:33:01,808 --> 00:33:04,290
And then I'm gonna get him
to admit that he did this.

830
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:06,572
And then when we get in the car
on the way to the ball park,

831
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:10,068
I'm gonna put a rope around his
neck and pull it till he's... dead!

832
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,857
Wait. Wait. You're in the backseat?

833
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,450
That's for garroting, yes.

834
00:33:13,516 --> 00:33:17,197
No, he's gonna smell something fishy
if you hop in the backseat
especially if you're driving.

835
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,581
No, he's not that bright. It'll work.

836
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:20,219
Why are you even buying the tickets?

837
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,753
Just sneak up and garrote him
on the street... save the money.

838
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:24,254
I can still go to the game the other way.

839
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,341
I'll take my friend Ed.
He hasn't been to a game in ages.

840
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:28,392
You're in no state to deal with T.J.
right now.

841
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:29,106
Maybe not.

842
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:32,251
And we need to do something about my bedroom.

843
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:32,880
I know.

844
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:36,019
So, let's figure out what we
need to deal with the hole.

845
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:37,257
- First things first.
- You're right.

846
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:38,457
- We need tarp.
- Tarp.

847
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:39,437
- And some plywood.
- Plywood.

848
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:40,533
- Staple gun.
- Staple gun.

849
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:41,268
Rope.

850
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:42,348
You're not garroting T.J.

851
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,312
- Skip the rope.
- No rope.

852
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:46,192
I'm sorry.

853
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:47,652
- It's not your fault.
- Eh, I'm dumb.

854
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:48,526
No, you're not.

855
00:33:48,582 --> 00:33:50,031
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No, you're not!

856
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:20,821
Goodnight. See you again.

857
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:30,326
Sorry. Kitchen's closed.

858
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:32,706
Rory.

859
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:33,937
Hi, Luke.

860
00:34:34,164 --> 00:34:34,993
Hi.

861
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:36,744
So, kitchen's closed.

862
00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:38,724
No, no, no. It's not closed.

863
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:39,619
Come on in.

864
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,244
Oh.

865
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:47,735
Oh, no. I just
...I figured.

866
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:50,084
No. Yes, you figured right. Thank you.

867
00:34:53,944 --> 00:34:56,771
So, it looks like the town's been
doing a little painting.

868
00:34:56,824 --> 00:34:59,332
Yeah, Taylor wanted to spiff it up.

869
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:00,966
Those are his words.

870
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,469
Put these obnoxious signs up.

871
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:07,490
"Pardon our spiff, it'll just take a jiff."
It's dumb.

872
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:09,145
Yeah. Dumb.

873
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:10,829
But it needed a...

874
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:12,707
spiff.

875
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:13,966
Yeah, it looks good.

876
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,307
So, I started my community service.

877
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:19,394
Right.

878
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:21,717
A little roadwork, vest and all.

879
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:24,272
5 hours down, 295 to go.

880
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,947
It's good you're chipping away at it.

881
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:26,804
Yeah.

882
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:28,778
Well.

883
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,880
So... how are people?

884
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:34,886
Are people good?

885
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:39,614
Yeah, people are good. People are, uh...

886
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,188
Your mom and I are engaged.

887
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,336
Engaged?

888
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:53,200
Yeah.

889
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,838
Wow.

890
00:35:58,802 --> 00:36:00,402
Congratulations.

891
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:02,502
Thanks.

892
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,658
So, I guess I'm gonna go.

893
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:09,578
Um... thank you for the coffee.

894
00:36:23,374 --> 00:36:24,489
T.J.

895
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:26,425
Lorelai, hey.

896
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:28,545
Am I glad to see you.

897
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:30,862
It's 7:00 a. m., T.J.

898
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:34,701
I know the sun ain't even warm yet,
and here we are toting that barge.

899
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,307
Mr. Taskmaster.

900
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:38,449
Who? Who has got you toting a barge?

901
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:41,661
Look, I need to explain my side
in the whole hole thing here.

902
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:42,713
It wasn't my fault.

903
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:43,518
It wasn't?

904
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:46,369
A guy says "okay," that means something.
Know what I mean?

905
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,382
It's not so complicated,
not like the TV guide or nothing.

906
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:51,237
It means "okay."

907
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,898
It's really early, T.J.

908
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:54,943
Anyway, I just don't want
you to be mad at me.

909
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:56,829
We're gonna be related, you and me.

910
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,262
Well, I'm not mad at you, T.J.

911
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:00,849
Hey, get away from her.

912
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:02,289
We're just talking.

913
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:05,014
T.J., stop bothering her, and get up here.

914
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,317
You want me to bring up a
couple more trash bags?

915
00:37:07,383 --> 00:37:08,579
I'm figuring we need some.

916
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:09,681
Okay, fine.

917
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:12,106
Now, is that okay in the sense
that I know that word?

918
00:37:12,169 --> 00:37:14,765
Or is that a Luke okay that can
mean whatever you want it to?

919
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:16,290
Just get up here.

920
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:18,233
He knew I was a self-starter.

921
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:21,002
Okay to a self-starter is
like glue to a horse.

922
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,225
What else can you do but start galloping?

923
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:24,725
Hey, Luke?

924
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:25,314
Yeah.

925
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,709
Are you aware of the time?

926
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:29,738
I'm just trying to make it so you don't
have to sleep on the couch
for the next three months.

927
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:31,479
If you want us to stop, we'll stop.

928
00:37:31,562 --> 00:37:34,759
No, it's just... the sun ain't even warm yet.

929
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,220
7:00 A.M. was Luke's idea.

930
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:38,651
I'd have started at 9:00 so
as not to bother people.

931
00:37:38,711 --> 00:37:42,129
That's just one guy who thinks
that okay means okay's opinion.

932
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:43,634
Would you just keep working?

933
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:47,882
So, maybe tomorrow, if you're still
doing this, it could be 8:00-ish.

934
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:49,449
I mean, I love that
you're doing it, but...

935
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:52,506
Yeah, I needed to start early so
I could get this done. Man!

936
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:53,550
What's with the 'tude?

937
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:55,431
Nothing.
It's just...

938
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,020
You know you got a frisbee up here?

939
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:57,674
A what?

940
00:37:57,729 --> 00:38:00,927
A frisbee, just sitting up here.
What are you thinking?!

941
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:02,211
It's not my frisbee.

942
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:03,851
So it just walked up here on its own?

943
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:07,959
Luke, there is a lost frisbee on the
roof of every suburban home in America.

944
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:11,155
Garrison Keillor said that.
It's not that big a deal.

945
00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:13,705
Every roof, huh?
Well, that's a great use of plastic.

946
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:14,886
It's not my frisbee.

947
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,264
I've never played frisbee.

948
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,566
What the hell has gotten into you?

949
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:19,719
I told Rory we were engaged.

950
00:38:20,212 --> 00:38:21,250
What?!

951
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,650
How? Where?

952
00:38:22,712 --> 00:38:27,044
She came into the diner last night.
It was awkward.
I ended up telling her we were engaged.

953
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:28,530
Why would you do that?

954
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:30,000
Why? Because she had the face.

955
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,680
What face?

956
00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:32,518
The Rory face. You know the face.

957
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,959
Yes, but, Luke,
you have to ignore the Rory face.

958
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,415
That's easy for you to say.

959
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:37,540
You shouldn't have told her.

960
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,015
Yeah, you should've told her.

961
00:38:39,077 --> 00:38:41,853
No. She's not being told anything.
Neither of us should've told her.

962
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,510
But if one of us isn't,
I'm the one that shouldn't.

963
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,269
Right. Meaning not you. I should've told her.

964
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,064
Then we're in full agreement.
You should've told her.

965
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:50,224
That's not what I'm saying.

966
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:52,198
You said it, and I agreed, so I win.

967
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,125
How do you win?

968
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:57,040
'Cause I have the high ground. That gives
me the upper hand on anything you got.

969
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,152
Luke.

970
00:38:58,198 --> 00:38:59,581
Something's wrong with this thing.

971
00:38:59,648 --> 00:39:01,631
There's nothing wrong with that thing.

972
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:02,619
Luke!

973
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,185
Rory started this.

974
00:39:04,253 --> 00:39:05,990
And right now we're not talking.

975
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:07,939
Remember, tough love? I'm on a path here.

976
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:09,897
She would've seen it in the paper eventually.

977
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:10,796
Seen what?

978
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,169
Our engagement.

979
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:13,972
How would it have ended up in the paper?

980
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,922
I don't know. She'd open up the paper
to the back to these stupid pictures

981
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,182
of a guy and a girl. Bill's a
chiropractor. Nancy's a teacher.

982
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:23,808
They met square dancing. They're
on their honeymoon in Florida.

983
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,957
And they got these smiles on their
faces like their lives are gonna work out

984
00:39:27,018 --> 00:39:29,927
the way they dreamt or something
...suckers. Those things.

985
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:32,837
You played right into her hands.
You can't do that.

986
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,853
She can't just play on our emotions.

987
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:39,058
She has to undo what she's done, get out
of my parents' house, go back to school.

988
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:40,798
Fine.
Maybe I shouldn't have told her anything.

989
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:43,374
Maybe I should've kicked her out,
ignored her, whatever.

990
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:45,683
But you got to understand
something... I'm in the middle.

991
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:47,934
Yeah, she's your daughter,
but I'm in the middle.

992
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:51,739
I know. You are in the middle.

993
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:55,247
Good, because you've been acting like
you don't know, like you're
alone in this or something.

994
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:55,953
I know.

995
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:58,769
And I know you don't want my opinion
on this, but you're both being dumb,

996
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,938
and you should be talking. There.

997
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:04,459
I won't say anything more about
any of this again ever.

998
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:10,099
T.J., the screw's not going in right 'cause
you got the drill on counterclockwise.

999
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,974
It's righty-tighty,
lefty-loosey.

1000
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,510
I've got to remember that.

1001
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:14,600
Ugh.

1002
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:16,540
All right, I got to get back to work.

1003
00:40:16,595 --> 00:40:18,220
We're gonna be done with what
we're doing here today.

1004
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:19,578
We won't be here tomorrow.

1005
00:40:19,932 --> 00:40:20,835
Luke?

1006
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:22,290
We're okay.

1007
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:23,548
Good.

1008
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,109
Nice catch.

1009
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:34,961
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

1010
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:36,966
Righty-tighty!

1011
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,566
Whoa, whoa! Break it up! Come on!
Break it up!

1012
00:40:55,851 --> 00:40:59,041
You're on the side of the road,
cars rushing by, tractor trailers.

1013
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,183
You see my point?

1014
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,055
That's not a playground out there.

1015
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:05,858
It's a work environment with
inherent dangers, obvious dangers,

1016
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:08,490
and there you are pushing someone around.

1017
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:10,016
That's unacceptable.

1018
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:13,338
Now, I cannot have you out there
with your fight face on.

1019
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:14,637
Do you understand me?

1020
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,223
Yes, sir.

1021
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:47,997
What's the problem?

1022
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:50,988
We're gonna need another thing
of bags for this next stretch.

1023
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:52,822
Well, then,
you're gonna have to check back on the bus.

1024
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:55,469
Thanks for nothing.

1025
00:41:58,467 --> 00:42:01,140
Repaying your debt to society, I assume.

1026
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:02,399
That's what this is.

1027
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:03,787
System already hardened you?

1028
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,848
So, I guess congratulations are in order.

1029
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:07,226
So, how are things at the new digs?

1030
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:08,304
You guys set a date yet?

1031
00:42:08,366 --> 00:42:09,707
Grandma redecorate the pool house yet?

00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:11,003
Be sure to send me a picture.

1033
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,689
Be sure to send me a
change-of-address card.

1034
00:42:12,746 --> 00:42:15,039
Grandma can print them out for
you with a little fleur-de-lis.

1035
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,745
I'm not supposed to be talking to outsiders.

1036
00:42:16,822 --> 00:42:17,609
Fine.

1037
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:21,155
You and Luke getting engaged
and not telling me about it.

1038
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:22,200
You hurt me.

1039
00:42:22,297 --> 00:42:23,547
Back at you.
