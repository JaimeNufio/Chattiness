1
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:19,829
And we're home.

2
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:22,240
How long does a freakin' van ride take?

3
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:23,095
Not that long!

4
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:26,025
Everybody in the world's life flashed before my eyes.

5
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:27,386
That's how much time I had.

6
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,568
I thought we were gonna die on that van.

7
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:31,113
It seemed a good possibility.

8
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,590
That van ride felt longer than our train ride from Paris to Prague,

9
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,325
and we had that group of French boys singing Sk8er Boi

10
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:39,803
and smelling like a soccer field sitting all around us.

11
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:42,307
Oh my God, you're back!

12
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:44,579
Morey, they're back!

13
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:47,052
Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?

14
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:47,959
Oh, we're fine.

15
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:50,679
You're fine? They're fine! Morey!

16
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:53,114
- They're fine! 
- Okay.

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,691
What the hell happened to you two?

18
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:56,924
According to the itinerary that Rory gave me,

19
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:58,858
you were supposed to be home on Saturday.

20
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:00,738
The itinerary that Rory gave you?

21
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:03,508
So when you girls didn't show up, we panicked! Morey?

22
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:05,787
Didn't we panic?

23
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:09,945
Hey, Morey, you ever thought about just staying out here at times like these?

24
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:12,176
By Sunday night, I was a complete basketcase.

25
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:15,515
I thought you'd been kidnapped by some crazy Sandinistas or something.

26
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:17,773
'Cause the Sandinista movement is so popular in France.

27
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:20,578
So, finally, I just started calling consulates.

28
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:22,263
- Consulates? 
- How many consulates?

29
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,320
Ah, jeez, all of 'em. Anyhow, you're here.

30
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,431
Let's go inside, I wanna hear all about Europe. Morey, I'm going in!

31
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:33,557
You gave her an itinerary?

32
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:36,016
I thought it would be good for someone to know where we were.

33
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:39,021
Oh, you gave her an itinerary and she called every consulate in the world.

34
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:42,057
If we were caught smuggling hash over the border

35
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:44,284
and we were thrown in some Turkish prison,

36
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:46,460
wouldn't you want someone to know that we were in Turkey?

37
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,997
Where'd we get this hash we were smuggling?

38
00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:50,977
You were at a café, you met a guy, he was sweet-talking you,

39
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:52,503
he put the stuff in your purse when you weren't looking.

40
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,203
At least tell me he was cute.

41
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,764
He was not bad for a hash dealer.

42
00:01:58,082 --> 00:01:59,789
I'm making cocoa!

43
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:03,081
She's making cocoa 'cause you gave her an itinerary.

44
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:04,524
I may have given her the itinerary,

45
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:06,799
but you're the one who got us busted for drug smuggling.

46
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,121
Reality has absolutely no place in our world.

47
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:13,397
Okay, I wanna hear all about Europe.

48
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,337
Come on, tell me, what'd you see?

49
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:21,400
Well, everything. Notre Dame, the Roman Baths, St. Peter's Basilica.

50
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:23,132
- Mom touched the Pope. 
- You're kidding!

51
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,396
Actually, I just touched his car.

52
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:27,191
Then one of the Swiss guards in the fruity cool clothing busted me.

53
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,634
Luckily, Mom's fluent in flirting.

54
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,948
And flirting with a guy in a pompom hat and a skirt is quite an accomplishment.

55
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:34,923
It sounds like you had a terrific trip.

56
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:35,698
It was.

57
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:41,216
Are you okay, hon?

58
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,503
Yeah, I'm just a little sleepy.

59
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:46,780
Of course, you girls must be wiped.

60
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:49,642
- I'll get out of here. 
- Oh, but thanks, Babette.

61
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,274
Goodnight, sleep tight. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

62
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:55,403
Morey, I'm coming home!

63
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:58,449
- I'm gonna go unpack. 
- Oh, unpack tomorrow.

64
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:01,516
No, if I leave stuff packed overnight, everything's gonna get gross.

65
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,109
Everything's already gross.

66
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:11,132
Oh my God, your bed feels good.

67
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:14,106
Do not get comfortable. I will sleep on top of you if I have to.

68
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:15,919
- Oh man, smell this. 
- What?

69
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:18,216
I forgot that pillows don't have to smell like feet.

70
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,970
You know, I have to say, I think it's good I did this hostel thing in my thirties,

71
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:25,463
- and I'll tell you why. 
- I missed you, I missed you all!

72
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,314
If I had done it in my twenties or teens,

73
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:32,160
I would've been naïve enough to think that hostels were exotic and romantic.

74
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:35,085
But once you're in your thirties, you've lived enough to know

75
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:37,095
they're gross and should be avoided at all costs.

76
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:39,122
I had a dream about you in Copenhagen.

77
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,903
You were there, and you, and you, and you.

78
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:44,929
Listen, since we slept on the plane, we should go to sleep now,

79
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:47,330
but get up really early tomorrow. We don't wanna blow this whole week

80
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:50,167
being jet-lagged. We need to establish normal sleeping patterns.

81
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:51,590
- Fine. 
- Okay.

82
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:54,569
I'm gonna go take a shower and leave you alone to make out with your sock drawer.

83
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:55,434
Close the door.

84
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:01,646
Hello, boys.

85
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,363
Gilmore, Lorelai, yes.

86
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:02,334
My daughter's name is Lorelai also.

87
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:05,600
Very confusing or, in your case, extremely convenient.

88
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,480
No, see, we were never missing, it was a big mistake.

89
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:11,961
- Who are you talking to? 
- Belgium.

90
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,331
Yes, Babette Dell.

91
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:17,756
She got our arrival dates mixed up and she was just worried,

92
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,599
but we're fine, we're here.

93
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,119
We just loved your fries.

94
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,593
Okay, sure, bye bye.

95
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:26,860
Okay, Belgium's done, Lisbon's calling me back,

96
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:29,593
Berlin had no idea what I was talking about, and Paris is pissed.

97
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:31,063
- At who? 
- Who knows?

98
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:34,903
Okay, I'm taking a break and then I'm taking on the Netherlands.

99
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,870
I still cannot believe Babette did this.

100
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:37,873
She just loves us.

101
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:40,940
Well, be a little less lovable, would you, 'cause it's costing me a fortune.

102
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:42,696
Try being one of those kids where people are like,

103
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:45,983
"Oh really, she was kidnapped? Hey, well, thin the herd."

104
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:49,003
Very nice. Hey, who are the rosary beads for?

105
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:49,864
They're mine.

106
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:51,389
What do you need rosary beads for?

107
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,710
- They're cute. 
- They're for prayer.

108
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:55,065
Well, pray they match my blue suit?

109
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:58,804
They have just upgraded you to a queen-size bed, Jacuzzi tub, junior suite in hell.

110
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,707
- Oh, Pieta placemat? 
- Oh, Gypsy.

111
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,612
How are you feeling?

112
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,362
You know, not bad. Just a little spacy.

113
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:07,923
Like a cold medicine buzz?

114
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:09,520
Maybe we got lucky and missed the jet lag.

115
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,305
I hope so because we have a very big week ahead of us.

116
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,207
Oh yeah? 

117
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,915
Yes. In fact, I have here in my hand a schedule of all the activities

118
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:18,014
we are going to partake in over this week,

119
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:20,456
the final week of Rory Gilmore's life

120
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:24,451
before she enters the ivy-covered hallowed halls of Yale University.

121
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:25,540
- Schedule, please. 
- Okay.

122
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:28,321
Today we get these presents out to our friends and then we hit the mall.

123
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:29,006
Got it.

124
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:30,810
Tomorrow we get an early start

125
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:33,406
and we hit three of the crappier movies that are out.

126
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:34,783
And then we have dinner at Grandma's.

127
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:36,954
Which I will conveniently not put down on my list in the hopes

128
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,500
that that magically goes away.

129
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:43,794
Okay, the next day we hit New York, see your fancy art galleries, hit the Strand.

130
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:45,335
Pizza at John's.

131
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:48,059
Sunday, pick up all the stuff you need for school,

132
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:49,437
and then there's a barbecue at Sookie's.

133
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:52,651
Monday is mani/pedi, facial, haircut, go to the psychic,

134
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:54,136
and stock up for Tuesday,

135
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:57,490
the day of all days - Godfather I, II, and III,

136
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:00,264
with extra showings of the Sofia death scene over and over

137
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:01,991
as long as the Mallomars hold out.

138
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:03,485
- The perfect day! 
- I agree.

139
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:05,799
And I think we have just enough of the biscotti

140
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:07,940
that we brought back from Milan to last us the rest of the week.

141
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,794
Oh, good. Well, everything's in order,

142
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:12,647
so, let's get going and get this stuff out of here.

143
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:16,363
Wow, we sure have a lot of gifts.

144
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,810
- Do we like this many people? 
- I didn't think so.

145
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:21,174
Maybe we're getting soft in our old age.

146
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,842
Okay, well, I guess we should get some tote bags.

147
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,912
- What tote bags? 
- We must have tote bags.

148
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,245
Where would we get tote bags?

149
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,347
Excuse me, every woman who's ever purchased

150
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:31,938
seventy-five dollars worth of Clinique products has some tote bags.

151
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:32,947
We don't have tote bags.

152
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,363
How are we supposed to get this stuff out of here?

153
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,275
Now we're the quirky backpack ladies.

154
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,686
One of the kinder nicknames that have been attributed to us.

155
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:43,985
Let's just be very efficient about this.

156
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,995
We'll start with Patty, work our way clockwise around the town, end with Andrew.

157
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:50,395
And let's stick with the 'my mom touched the Pope' anecdote.

158
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:53,074
It's quick, it's peppy, and everybody likes a nice Pope story.

159
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,982
Do we have time to stop at Luke's? I'm starving.

160
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:58,894
Absolutely. This is our week, this week we do anything we want.

161
00:07:58,985 --> 00:07:59,781
I like this week.

162
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:03,493
I wonder if Luke and Nicole actually went on that cruise.

163
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:04,552
I thought he was going.

164
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:06,676
Yeah, I know, but I wonder if he actually went.

165
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:08,536
- Why wouldn't he? 
- I don't know.

166
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:12,130
Because he'd have to pack and leave, plus he'd have to buy a bathing suit.

167
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:14,153
I hope he went. He could use a good vacation.

168
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:15,781
Plus, he really seems to like Nicole.

169
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:17,516
Yeah, he does.

170
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:21,607
Oh, hey, looks like the soda shop is open.

171
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,799
Oh, cool.

172
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:24,029
I am gonna kill you.

173
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:26,461
- Oh, please, you are not. 
- I am, too. I'm gonna kill you.

174
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:28,254
I should've killed you before. I should've killed you

175
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,376
the minute you put up those unicorn topiaries in the park, but, hey, hindsight, right?

176
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,451
I've missed that.

177
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,840
What do you think, biscotti moment?

178
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,167
Absolutely.

179
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:41,554
- You don't have to yell, Luke. 
- You put a giant window in my wall.

180
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:44,075
- So what? 
- A giant window! Right here!

181
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:46,015
You can see my entire diner.

182
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:49,640
And when I'm in my diner, I can see your whole stupid store.

183
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:53,352
I don't understand why yours is a diner and mine is a stupid store.

184
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,687
Look at this place! Look at you.

185
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:59,434
All you need is six dancing penguins and Mary Poppins floating in the corner

186
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,902
to bring back two of the worst hours of my childhood.

187
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,607
I don't think you had a childhood. I think you came out a bitter surly killjoy.

188
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:09,982
You can't change the basic structure of this place without my okay!

189
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:11,990
What?

190
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,342
Your hand is near the wax lips.

191
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:15,414
So?

192
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:18,737
If you could just move it so you don't accidentally touch the candy.

193
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:21,778
Lucas.

194
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:24,272
What are you doing?

195
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:28,715
- You stop that right now! 
- Look at all the pretty candy!

196
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:30,457
Stop it right now!

197
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:31,198
Oh my God!

198
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:32,556
What? What's the matter?

199
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,329
Luke.

200
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,885
Yeah, he's finally lost it.

201
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:36,094
No, we forgot Luke.

202
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:37,041
We forgot Luke what?

203
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:41,076
Oh, we forgot to bring him back a gift. Oh no!

204
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:42,760
We kept putting it off and putting it off.

205
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:44,214
We couldn't find anything good enough.

206
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,201
We should've gotten him that bullfighter's uniform.

207
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,173
So what do we do?

208
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:50,195
We have to just pick up something here

209
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,611
and we'll tell him that we got it in Denmark.

210
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,106
- Pick up what? 
- Something.

211
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:55,790
What? This is Stars Hollow.

212
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,397
Everything you buy here has a Hello, Kitty stamped on the bottom.

213
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:01,264
Well, we have to get him something. We cannot go into Luke's empty handed.

214
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,144
Great.

215
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:03,174
Come on.

216
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,212
I'm hungry.

217
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,406
Hey, Sookie!

218
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:11,274
- You're back! 
- We're back!

219
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:14,458
Hey, don't squish baby!

220
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:17,187
- I missed you so much! 
- We missed you so much.

221
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:19,656
Ah, look at you! You look older.

222
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:20,755
Oh, thanks, Sookie.

223
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,185
So how was it, was it wonderful?

224
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,899
I wanna hear everything you did and everything you ate.

225
00:10:24,985 --> 00:10:26,753
Oh, was it warm? I read it was warm.

226
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:28,703
How was Barcelona? Did you see the gaudy apartments?

227
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:31,646
Did you see a bullfight? Did you see Anne Frank's house?

228
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:33,915
Did you cry? Was Steven Speilberg there, huh?

229
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:36,648
Hey, I hear you touched the Pope! Are you hungry?

230
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:38,488
Do you want anything to eat? I've got quiche.

231
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:40,873
Hold on one sec here, missy. I need to look at you.

232
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:42,537
- Sideways, please. 
- Okay.

233
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:45,594
Hello, hi, nice to see you.

234
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,866
I'm your Auntie Lorelai, and this is your Auntie Rory. Say hi, Rory.

235
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:52,387
- Come over here. 
- Oh, no, I'm good.

236
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:54,190
Come on, Rory, rub my stomach.

237
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:55,168
I'd rather not.

238
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:57,559
- Rory's a chicken. 
- So is Jackson.

239
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,837
Hey, I'm gonna like it when it comes out.

240
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,787
So what did the ultrasound say, boy or girl?

241
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:04,242
- It's a... 
- Buh-buh-buh...

242
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:06,110
It's a buh? What's a buh?

243
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:07,231
Read.

244
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:09,914
"I do not want to know the sex of my baby."

245
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:12,653
That's right. I'm going old school on this.

246
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:14,516
And he's being completely stubborn.

247
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:15,550
But you know?

248
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:18,337
Of course I know. I had little clothes to buy...

249
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,023
What? I said nothing about the sex.

250
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:24,977
You said little, and now I know it's going to be little.

251
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:27,103
Jackson, seriously, you don't wanna know?

252
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:31,207
Hey, in the old days, the guys would pace back and forth in the waiting room

253
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:34,168
until a pretty nurse in a nice white outfit would come out and say,

254
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:37,572
"Congratulations - it's a 'insert your chosen sex here'."

255
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:40,148
Ricky Ricardo didn't know, Dick van Dyke didn't know,

256
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:43,563
and by gum, if it was good enough for Rick and Dick, it's good enough for me.

257
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,987
Well, I wanna know.

258
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:46,717
Rory, what do you say? Be on my side.

259
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,574
Jackson, there are no sides.

260
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:52,523
We can be in that waiting room together, pacing, waiting,

261
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,239
we'll get you a nice suit. What do you say?

262
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:56,890
Okay, sure. I'm on Jackson's side.

263
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:59,266
Great. Welcome to 1954.

264
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,212
- Happy to be here. 
- Well, I wanna know.

265
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:03,020
Come on, I'll tell you outside.

266
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:04,069
Sure you don't wanna go?

267
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:05,329
Read the button, missy.

268
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:11,575
So, you hear about that whole Sputnik thing?

269
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,895
Oh, Eisenhower's on top of it.

270
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:18,130
So Jackson's really not gonna be in the delivery room with you?

271
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:19,538
- Nope. 
- Does that bug you?

272
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:21,973
Hey, I don't like Jackson to see me shave my legs, so...

273
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:23,336
I'm opening the shed!

274
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,264
- Okay, are you ready? 
- For what?

275
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:33,070
- It's a boy! 
- It's a boy!

276
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:35,624
Oh, Sookie, you're having a boy!

277
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:39,076
I know! Jackson will finally have that son to prune the trees with.

278
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:42,628
My God, it's so exciting. A boy!

279
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:46,627
Oh, a little boy. I know nothing about little boys.

280
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:47,594
Me neither.

281
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,927
- Man, you're prepared, aren't you? 
- Yes, I am.

282
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,331
- It's so nice to be home. 
- It's nice to have you home.

283
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,470
- Hey, have you seen Luke lately? 
- Briefly.

284
00:12:57,575 --> 00:12:59,591
I guess he went on that cruise, huh?

285
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,987
That's good. That's good he went.

286
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:04,742
He needed a vacation. He works hard, that one.

287
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:07,886
Always cooking, making the coffee, taking the orders.

288
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,122
You know, I think something happened on that trip of his.

289
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:12,705
What do you mean?

290
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:15,387
Well, the day he got back, Jackson and I went into the diner

291
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,656
and I asked him how his trip went.

292
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:18,581
He couldn't get away from me fast enough.

293
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:21,069
Really? Was Jackson wearing that creepy button?

294
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:23,890
Nope. Luke just seemed kind of freaked out about something.

295
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:25,228
- What? 
- I don't know.

296
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:27,812
You think he and Nicole had a fight or something?

297
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:29,840
- I don't know. 
- He didn't say anything?

298
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:33,096
Nope. He just walked around acting weirder than normal.

299
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,769
Wonder what that's all about.

300
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,941
So... are you gonna name him Lorelai?

301
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,526
Absolutely. That wouldn't be confusing at all.

302
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:47,243
Great.

303
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,576
I cannot believe you.

304
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:57,273
What? It's the perfect gift for Luke. Fine fancy jam from France.

305
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,163
Fine fancy jam from Jackson's pantry.

306
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,087
I don't know what you're talking about.

307
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,392
I am looking right here at this beautiful hand-crafted label

308
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:05,477
and it says "Fruits de la Terre."

309
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:07,503
You didn't even spellcheck to make sure you got the French right.

310
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:10,621
Yes, well, I think it adds an authentic touch.

311
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:14,205
See, in my world, the person who made this jam

312
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,457
was an illiterate orphan... Sochelle.

313
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:19,782
- As in Sochelle Crab. 
- Yes, exactly.

314
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:23,502
Sochelle was born by the sea, or so said the note left in the bassinet

315
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,788
when the nuns found her on the steps of Notre Dame.

316
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,982
- Oh, good, there are nuns. 
- Every sad story needs nuns.

317
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:33,953
Anyhow, Sochelle had nothing - no father, no mother, no friends, no education.

318
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:36,866
All she had was a burning desire to make great jam,

319
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:39,718
and now she's the most successful jamstress in Paris.

320
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:41,387
- Luke's gonna know. 
- No, he is not.

321
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,096
As much as I would like to be there when you give Luke your heartfelt gift,

322
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,514
I'm gonna go give Lane her gift.

323
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:47,614
All right, but if you're not there, I'm gonna get all the credit for this.

324
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,741
Exactly as it should be.

325
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:50,649
- Give Lane a hug for me. 
- I will.

326
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:54,945
- Don't give him the jam. 
- I can't hear you, I'm too far away.

327
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:04,310
Bonjour, Luke. Pouvez-vous attacher vos chaussures?

328
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:06,055
- What? 
- Hi, Luke.

329
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,315
Do you know how to tie your shoes?

330
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,273
Very good.

331
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:10,136
It came in handy, let me tell you.

332
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,052
Not one shoelace fatality on my watch.

333
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:15,001
You remembered.

334
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:17,478
A couple things about you stick. You have a good time?

335
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,675
- Vos odeurs de chat. 
- What's that?

336
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:20,525
Your cat smells.

337
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:22,271
You must've been a big hit with the salon set.

338
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,652
The trip was incredible, we had the best time.

339
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,004
We were supposed to come back on Saturday.

340
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,211
- I know. 
- Keeping tabs on me?

341
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,001
Always safer to know which direction the tornado's coming from.

342
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,834
Anyhow, we were in London and we ran into this group of girls

343
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:35,757
who were heading to Ireland to stake out the Clarence Hotel.

344
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,818
Why?

345
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:39,188
Because U2 owns it and Bono hangs out there.

346
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:40,284
Him again.

347
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,883
So then we jumped on a train and we headed to Ireland

348
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:46,915
- incredibly beautiful, by the way - and we sat in a bar for two days

349
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:50,616
and did nothing but eat soda crackers and funky cheese and he never showed.

350
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:51,900
Que sera.

351
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:56,187
Still good. I told 'em about you over there, Señor Swanky-pants.

352
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,849
Can't tell you how grateful I am to have you as my press agent.

353
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:01,363
And we got you something.

354
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,897
- You did? 
- Yes, we did.

355
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:04,952
You didn't have to do that.

356
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,714
What are you talking about?

357
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:10,957
We do not go to Europe and come back without bringing something for Luke.

358
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:12,084
Here.

359
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:13,677
Jam.

360
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:15,150
Yes, fancy French jam.

361
00:16:15,368 --> 00:16:17,485
Fruits de la Terre. Very impressive.

362
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:20,552
It's handmade by this woman in Paris who has the most amazing story.

363
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,585
- Really? 
- Yeah. Orphaned.

364
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:24,945
- And illiterate. 
- Okay.

365
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:26,952
Just had nothing in her life, you know,

366
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:30,481
except this burning desire to be the world's greatest jamstress.

367
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,558
And she's famous now and, you know,

368
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:36,502
she only makes three bottles of that stuff a year and that's one of 'em,

369
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,662
and I brought it all the way across the... I got it from Sookie's house.

370
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:41,744
- No. 
- How did you know?

371
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:43,387
Just a wild guess.

372
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,660
I swear, we tried to get you something, but nothing was good enough.

373
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,937
No, forget it. I didn't get you anything on my trip either. We're even.

374
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,457
Oh, yeah, how was the cruise?

375
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:53,117
Oh, it was... you know.

376
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:54,908
Not really, I've never been on a cruise.

377
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:57,965
- So... 
- It was fine.

378
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,502
Okay. So, you and Nicole had fun then?

379
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:02,793
Yeah... You want more coffee?

380
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:05,409
So what did you?

381
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,201
- Where? 
- On the boat?

382
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:08,512
What did you and Nicole do on the boat?

383
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,675
Oh, you know, we fluttered around and ate,

384
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:15,967
and there was a magic show and a singer

385
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:20,170
and pillow mints, and you know, that's it.

386
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:23,344
But you and Nicole had a good time, you got along, and...

387
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:25,295
Yeah. I'm gonna go check on your food.

388
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:29,571
I didn't order anything yet.

389
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:33,052
Hi, Kirk.

390
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,855
Bienvenido, señora Gilmore.

391
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,459
What are you doing? I just put that there.

392
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,609
Scoop toward you, rolling smoothly.

393
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,401
Very good, Ginger.

394
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:52,349
Nice symmetrical balls there, Joshua.

395
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:55,273
Easy on the nuts, easy on the nuts.

396
00:17:55,437 --> 00:18:00,395
One cherry, and then present your sundae with a Taylor Tip.

397
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:02,611
Excuse me, Taylor.

398
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,754
Ah, there you are. Hello, your majesty.

399
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:07,521
Come to check on your little kingdom?

400
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,026
Ginger, hand me a spoon.

401
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:12,655
- I was just walking by when I... 
- Here you are, on the house.

402
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,211
- Thank you. 
- Would you like an extra cherry?

403
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,924
Because if the Stars Hollow Ice Cream Queen wants two cherries,

404
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,888
then she will get two cherries, and to hell with the extra twenty-five cent charge.

405
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:25,548
Taylor, you didn't ask me if I wanted to be the Ice Cream Queen.

406
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:28,242
- So? 
- So, you didn't ask me.

407
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,940
You just put my picture on a flier and stuck it up all over town.

408
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:33,474
Well, I couldn't very well ask you when you were traipsing all over Europe,

409
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:34,724
- now could I? 
- But...

410
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:36,363
And don't worry about getting anything.

411
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,999
I have already rented a cape and a crown.

412
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:44,047
Just wear a nice simple sage-colored floor-length dress and you'll be fine.

413
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,311
I can't do it.

414
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,490
What do you mean, you can't do it?

415
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:50,534
I mean, I'm busy right now. I only have a couple days left before I go off to school,

416
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,460
and my mom and I have every moment planned,

417
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:54,640
so I'm just going to have to pass on this one.

418
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:57,472
Oh, I see.

419
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:00,903
You're going to pass. You're passing on this.

420
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:03,897
Fine. Just consider yourself passed.

421
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,961
- Look, I can still come by. 
- Oh, can you, really?

422
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:11,485
You can find time in your busy day to come by

423
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:13,908
and eat my free ice cream and take my free balloon

424
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:17,845
and get yourself a free glitter hand stamp? You can swing that?

425
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:19,745
You don't have to pass on that, huh?

426
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:22,882
- Look, Taylor, don't take it like this. 
- In my own defense,

427
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:28,156
I assumed you would be thrilled based on your past participation record.

428
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,283
But this has nothing to do with...

429
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:32,897
You've always been the head pilgrim girl at the food drive table.

430
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,157
Yes, that's for charity.

431
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:37,403
The third leprechaun at the St. Patty's Day festival.

432
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,835
Yes, okay, but again, for charity.

433
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,741
You man the ticket booth on Groundhog Day.

434
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:44,376
You help organize the manger procession at Christmas,

435
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:47,367
you play Esther every year at the Purim carnival.

436
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:51,068
I just assumed you liked taking part in town events.

437
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:53,219
I do like it, but I just can't this time. I'm sorry.

438
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,989
Oh, don't be. It's my own fault.

439
00:19:56,132 --> 00:20:00,673
I should have figured that once you got into Yale everything would be different.

440
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:03,736
- That's not fair. 
- No, I understand.

441
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:06,752
You're no longer our little Stars Hollow Rory Gilmore.

442
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,968
You belong to the Ivy Leagues right now.

443
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:13,013
It's time to cut those small town ties and go off and do something important

444
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,305
like go to drama school or have one of those high-class naked parties

445
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,920
- with that Bush girl. 
- Taylor...

446
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:21,160
Okay. See you around the quad.

447
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:41,926
Okay, that took way longer than it was supposed to.

448
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,128
From now on, when we go out of town, no presents for anyone.

449
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:47,441
Oh, right. So we'll just buy everyone a big crate of Fruits de la Terre.

450
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:49,513
That horse is dead, put the stick down.

451
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,898
Now we're way behind in our schedule, so I propose a change.

452
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,992
Let's hold off on the frivolous shopping until tomorrow.

453
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:56,360
What's up?

454
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:00,061
That Taylor thing is still bugging me.

455
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:02,581
Me, too. I can't believe you didn't call me in to see the fight.

456
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:05,303
Maybe I am different. Maybe I do have an attitude.

457
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,344
I think you do.

458
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:09,517
I mean, I've always had time for the town in the past, and now suddenly I don't?

459
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,505
Am I changing? I don't wanna change.

460
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:14,080
I don't wanna be the anti-town girl. I'm not Daria.

461
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:17,178
Taylor is just messing with your mind, which is one of his specialties. Ignore him.

462
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:18,059
I guess.

463
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:21,986
Hey, hey, no mail yet. We agreed, we're still on vacation.

464
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:25,114
I'll just look through my mail. Yours can sit there as long as you like.

465
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:26,675
Yeah, but then you're back in the real world again

466
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:29,209
and I'm out here in vacation-land alone. That's not fun.

467
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,371
Oh no.

468
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,170
- What? 
- Oh no.

469
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:35,410
What oh no?

470
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:44,016
Hey, kid, you're kind of freaking me out here.

471
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,799
- I wrote the date down wrong. 
- What date?

472
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:51,763
This is from Yale. My orientation is Saturday.

473
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:53,534
- Right, next Saturday. 
- No, this Saturday.

474
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:55,783
- No, next Saturday. 
- No, this Saturday.

475
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:58,388
But today's Thursday. That means we have no...

476
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:00,385
I have to be at school the day after tomorrow.

477
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:04,667
But... no! We had a free week. I had it all scheduled out.

478
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:06,074
I wrote the date down wrong.

479
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,543
- Why would you do that? 
- I don't know.

480
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:08,972
You never write the date down wrong.

481
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:11,214
I wrote it down before we left and I wrote it down wrong.

482
00:22:11,322 --> 00:22:12,444
We were supposed to have a week.

483
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:13,406
Well, we don't.

484
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,847
I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong.

485
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:18,223
I can't believe you weren't gonna let me open the mail.

486
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:20,168
I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong.

487
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:22,555
I can't believe you made us go to Ireland to stalk Bono.

488
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:24,772
This isn't fair. You have more I-can't-believe's than I do.

489
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,800
- This sucks. 
- This totally sucks.

490
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:29,529
Well, I'm not ready. I haven't packed. I have things I need to get.

491
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,489
We were supposed to watch the three Godfather's

492
00:22:31,577 --> 00:22:34,290
and Sofia dying over and over and eat our biscotti and...

493
00:22:34,397 --> 00:22:36,979
Okay, listen, calm down. We just need to revise our plan.

494
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:38,433
We were supposed to have a week.

495
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:42,016
Okay, tonight we stay home and pack. Tomorrow we get up early.

496
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:44,510
We'll get all the stuff you need, and that will give us time

497
00:22:44,556 --> 00:22:46,332
to watch at least two Godfather's and a Sofia dying.

498
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:49,395
We'll still have a partial day and a great biscotti night.

499
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:50,743
Chinese.

500
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:52,351
- What? 
- Food. Order it. Go.

501
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,412
No, no time for full sentences!

502
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,743
- Right. 
- Ordering!

503
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,746
I'm so wiped. I shouldn't have taken that third Excedrin PM last night.

504
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:02,307
Third? Why'd you take three?

505
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:05,570
Oh, well, originally I took two,

506
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,376
then somewhere around four in the morning, I woke up

507
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:08,704
and had a major Marilyn moment.

508
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:12,031
I forgot that I'd taken something and so I popped a third one

509
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:13,572
and now I'm about ready to sleep with a Kennedy.

510
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,841
I hear Kerry's available.

511
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,726
Okay, let's sit. God, Mr. Jet Lag wants to be my best friend.

512
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,197
Do you wanna go home and rest?

513
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:24,432
No. We have a Godfather night to salvage. Check the list.

514
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:28,922
Okay, we got the sheets, towels, bathroom shower caddy,

515
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,817
and the basic first aid accoutrement.

516
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:35,081
We still need to hit the beauty supply, the hardware store, stationery store.

517
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:36,006
The mattress store.

518
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:38,348
You do know that they supply you with a mattress at the dorm.

519
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:40,903
Yeah. A mattress that decades of students

520
00:23:41,015 --> 00:23:45,276
in various states of cleanliness have slept on. Some without pajamas.

521
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,699
- Gross. 
- Exactly.

522
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,825
We've been running around for hours and this list isn't getting any shorter.

523
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:51,967
- We're never gonna finish. 
- Stop. Yes, we are.

524
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,727
We just need to split up. We'll get all this done quicker.

525
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:57,491
I'll take the beauty supply and you take the stationery store,

526
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,028
and we'll meet back here in twenty minutes.

527
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,728
- Oh, boy. 
- What?

528
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,549
I'm gonna walk right past that stupid grand opening.

529
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,193
I would take the stationery store,

530
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:10,103
but you're so weird about what kind of pens you like.

531
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:13,395
No, no. I'll just... I'll walk really fast. Maybe Taylor won't notice me.

532
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:18,013
Yeah. You better walk really fast, like warp speed Mr. Sulu kind of fast.

533
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:19,867
- Let's go. 
- Twenty minutes!

534
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:23,435
since these and many other flavors await your tongues

535
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:27,751
at Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store.

536
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:30,491
I wanna thank you all for coming here today

537
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:33,521
to help us celebrate our grand opening.

538
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,965
Now, originally we were supposed to have our Ice Cream Queen here,

539
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,447
but unfortunately, kids, she was just too busy.

540
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:47,868
She just couldn't find time in her busy queen schedule

541
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:51,037
to come play with all of you here today.

542
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:55,794
I know, Christy, but take heart,

543
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:58,426
we still have balloons and music,

544
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:00,484
and as a special treat a little later,

545
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:05,927
a skydiver is going to drop from the sky and land right here

546
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:10,068
in front of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store.

547
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:12,045
Isn't that great, kids?

548
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:18,861
A skydiver who isn't too busy to come play with you will be here soon.

549
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:21,414
- Hey, Kirk. 
- Hello.

550
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:26,038
Hey, I'm looking for a good daytime cream and a good nighttime cream.

551
00:25:26,187 --> 00:25:27,621
- For you? 
- No, for Rory.

552
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:30,508
Is she sensitive, prone to breakouts if the cream is too heavy?

553
00:25:30,957 --> 00:25:35,351
I thought so. Okay, first of all, I would stay far away from that one.

554
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:37,031
Much too rich for her.

555
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:41,164
This one is light with a fresh citrus scent and it is completely natural.

556
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:42,007
We like that.

557
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:44,373
Now, for day, I would recommend something with a sunscreen.

558
00:25:44,537 --> 00:25:47,086
Rory has a classic peaches and cream complexion,

559
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:49,223
and it would be a crime if, when she got older,

560
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:51,152
her face started to look like a cowboy.

561
00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:53,666
- I couldn't agree more. 
- All right. This should work.

562
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:54,486
Thank you.

563
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,685
You know, I heard you got back from your trip.

564
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,052
Yup, I'm living proof.

565
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:01,873
Miss Patty showed me the castanets you brought her.

566
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,154
- Oh yeah? 
- Yeah.

567
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:07,050
And Andrew showed me the T-shirt from the Picasso museum.

568
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,138
I must admit, I was a little jealous.

569
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:11,782
I mean, I hate Picasso, but I love T-shirts.

570
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,539
And Pete seemed to really enjoy the Tower of London nutcracker you brought him.

571
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:18,452
A nutcracker's a very useful thing to have around.

572
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:20,956
I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting in my living room

573
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:23,865
with a nut thinking, "if only I had a way to crack this."

574
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:27,167
Okay, Kirk, I'm really sorry, we got a little messed up on the presents.

575
00:26:27,557 --> 00:26:29,793
It just got so crazy over there.

576
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,811
I mean, we forgot to bring something back for Luke.

577
00:26:31,943 --> 00:26:33,905
- I heard he got jam. 
- Fake jam.

578
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:35,005
I love fake jam.

579
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:37,439
You know what, I'm gonna make this up to you, okay?

580
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:40,167
- Really? 
- I promise.

581
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:42,039
We never meant to forget you.

582
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:45,251
Okay, well, sure.

583
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:47,070
You can make it up to me.

584
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:49,547
Now how much do I owe you?

585
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:53,775
45.50. You're lucky you came in when you did.

586
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,483
- I'm closing a little early today. 
- Well, lucky me.

587
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,301
Kirk, no.

588
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:05,937
Taylor paid me twenty dollars to jump out of a plane for the grand opening.

589
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:09,591
But I took a lesson. The guy said I was a natural at falling.

590
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:13,811
Kirk, listen to me, this is the best gift I could possibly give you -

591
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:15,532
don't do that, okay?

592
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:17,702
Do I still get the jam?

593
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:23,448
Thanks a lot.

594
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:24,670
Yale can have you.

595
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:28,162
Honey. Hey, did you get your silly pens?

596
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:30,875
Okay, good. Now I can mark these two things off,

597
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:33,159
and we only have about ten thousand other things to do.

598
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:33,881
Great.

599
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,956
You know, I think the only way we're gonna get this all done is if we prioritize.

600
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,810
- Meaning? 
- Something has to go.

601
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:42,657
- Biscotti night. 
- No, not biscotti night.

602
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,937
I think we should bail on Friday night dinner.

603
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,383
- Cancel on Grandma? 
- Yes, cancel on Grandma.

604
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,422
I can't do that.

605
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:50,332
Rory, we need to get this stuff before tomorrow.

606
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,286
There's no way we can do that if we have to drive all the way to Hartford and back.

607
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,297
She'll understand. Well, the first part was true.

608
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,476
I can't skip dinner.

609
00:27:57,644 --> 00:28:00,137
Come on, we're gonna go to dinner next week

610
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:02,943
and every week after that for the rest of our lives.

611
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:07,223
And I do mean the rest of our lives because my parents will outlive us.

612
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,565
The damned can do that.

613
00:28:08,656 --> 00:28:11,887
Mom, I made a deal. This is why I get to go to Yale. I can't back out.

614
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:13,884
- It's our last night. 
- I have to go.

615
00:28:13,997 --> 00:28:15,144
You don't have to, but I do.

616
00:28:15,282 --> 00:28:16,552
What do you mean I don't have to go?

617
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:19,189
I was very clear when I made this deal that it was only for me.

618
00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:21,273
You're right, I don't have to go.

619
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:24,769
Boy, that's an oddly liberating feeling. I don't have to go.

620
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,960
I don't have to go. I do not have to go to dinner.

621
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:28,103
- Mom. 
- Hang on, I'm not done.

622
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:30,637
I do not have to go ever if I'm not in the mood.

623
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:31,297
Mom.

624
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,699
I'm not going. I'll finish up all the errands.

625
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:34,606
- Really? 
- Yes.

626
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:37,779
You go and you eat really fast and then get out of there.

627
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:39,888
Meet me back here 9:30, 10 at the latest,

628
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:43,212
and we'll do Godfather I through "Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,"

629
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:44,810
- and a quick Sofia dying. 
- Deal.

630
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:45,663
Remember, eat fast.

631
00:28:47,534 --> 00:28:50,041
Now just picture her sitting here just like this,

632
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:55,844
smiling and waving. 'Hello kids, I'm the Ice Cream Queen.'

633
00:28:57,037 --> 00:29:01,430
Okay, that's it. I humiliate myself at least six times a year for this town,

634
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:04,398
and just because I'm going to Yale, that's not going to stop.

635
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:07,230
Now the reason I am not the Ice Cream Queen

636
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:08,981
is because Taylor never asked me.

637
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:11,177
I didn't know about it, and that's why I was busy.

638
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,144
Now I love this town, I will be back

639
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:15,724
in that ridiculous pilgrim outfit at Thanksgiving,

640
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:17,844
so everybody just get off my back.

641
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:27,766
Richard, they're here! Put those papers away and fix your tie.

642
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:31,259
- Hey, Grandma. 
- Hello, Rory.

643
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:33,732
- Nice to see you. 
- It's nice to see you, too.

644
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:34,597
Come on in.

645
00:29:35,427 --> 00:29:36,419
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

646
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:39,067
Well, you're here now and that's all that matters.

647
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,839
Shall we go into the living room?

648
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,421
Yes. Then I can give you your present.

649
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,968
My present? Well, that sounds very interesting.

650
00:29:46,255 --> 00:29:49,046
We bought it for you in Paris because Mom said you loved Paris the most.

651
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:50,884
I wonder what it could be.

652
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:54,432
For you.

653
00:29:56,716 --> 00:30:01,810
Oh my, it's lovely, Rory, really. Just beautiful.

654
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:03,818
It was between this and the Arc de Triumphe,

655
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,994
but Mom said that the Eiffel Tower was fancier.

656
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:08,355
I agree, and I love it. Thank you.

657
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:09,161
You're welcome.

658
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:13,110
So, where is your mother tonight? Not sick, I hope.

659
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,804
Oh, no, she's fine. She just had some things to do.

660
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:17,074
Ah, things.

661
00:30:17,836 --> 00:30:20,539
- Errands, actually. 
- Errands, of course.

662
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:24,093
But she'll be here next week, and she says she's looking forward to it.

663
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:27,232
Emily, I'm expecting a call and there's nothing I can do about it,

664
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:29,049
so please don't be upset when I leave the table.

665
00:30:29,223 --> 00:30:31,138
Rory, how lovely to see you.

666
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,388
Well, how was the first European excursion?

667
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:35,235
It was perfect.

668
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:37,967
Lorelai had chores to do tonight.

669
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,191
- Chores? 
- Errands, you know.

670
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:40,861
Errands?

671
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:43,487
Yes, that's why she didn't come, she had to run errands.

672
00:30:43,697 --> 00:30:46,944
But she'll be here next week, and she's looking forward to it. Isn't that nice?

673
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,085
- I suppose. 
- I think so, too.

674
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:50,830
Would you like to see my present?

675
00:30:50,926 --> 00:30:52,100
Well, that's very nice.

676
00:30:53,072 --> 00:30:54,773
That'll fit right in with your collection, Emily.

677
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:55,638
Yes, it will.

678
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:57,373
We got something for you, too, Grandpa.

679
00:30:57,737 --> 00:31:01,786
Well, I guess you're not the only one who gets a treat tonight.

680
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,661
Oh, and just when I thought I was special.

681
00:31:04,193 --> 00:31:06,779
Look at that. That's beautiful.

682
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:09,800
We found this amazing pipe store in Copenhagen

683
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:11,602
and the man there can carve anything you want.

684
00:31:11,673 --> 00:31:13,808
His family's been doing it for over a hundred and fifty years.

685
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:17,147
And they had a whole set of Alice in Wonderland pipes that Mom wanted to get,

686
00:31:17,218 --> 00:31:19,798
but they were way too expensive so we just got the Queen of Hearts.

687
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:20,988
Well, I love it.

688
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,797
Yes, and you're gonna love it outside on the patio.

689
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,433
As you wish, my dear.

690
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,442
That's my call, that's my call.

691
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:30,563
Hurry back, or we'll start without you.

692
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:31,949
Five minutes. Ten, tops.

693
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:33,972
He'll be an hour.

694
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:35,692
Is his new business going well?

695
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,001
Oh, who knows? He's not in the room long enough to find out.

696
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:39,936
Dinner is served, Mrs. Gilmore.

697
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:41,063
All right, Gerta.

698
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:43,142
Well, I guess we should go in and eat.

699
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:44,088
What about Grandpa?

700
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:45,440
Oh, we'll save him something.

701
00:31:57,198 --> 00:32:00,882
So, Rory, tell me, how were the Gundersons?

702
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:03,044
- The who? 
- The Gundersons.

703
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,431
Our friends in Zurich.

704
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:06,970
The ones we told you two to look up when you got there.

705
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:09,444
Oh, the Gundersons, right.

706
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:12,505
I tell ya, they better have given you a first class welcome.

707
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:16,263
Especially after that son of theirs squatted here for over a month last year.

708
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:17,769
And ruined the rug in the guest room.

709
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:20,359
That's right. Hope you ruined one of their rugs as well.

710
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:24,993
Actually, we didn't get a chance to see the Gundersons.

711
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,816
Why not? Were they out of town?

712
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,402
- Well, I... 
- You did go to Zurich, didn't you?

713
00:32:29,642 --> 00:32:32,065
Yes, but, you know, Zurich was so crazy for us

714
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:35,054
that we just figured, 'Ah, we'll just catch 'em next time.'

715
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:35,961
You didn't call them?

716
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:37,711
You know, there really wasn't time.

717
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:40,262
Well, what about the Egerholms in Denmark?

718
00:32:40,594 --> 00:32:42,145
Is their new house a monstrosity?

719
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:46,543
Well, if you think Zurich was hectic, then Denmark was just... whoo!

720
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:49,501
- You didn't call them? 
- No.

721
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:51,351
- The Rezoscos in Florence? 
- No.

722
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:52,810
The Talbots in London?

723
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,690
We were only in London for two days.

724
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,224
Well, who did you look up when you went to Europe?

725
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:58,904
Jim Morrison says hello.

726
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,614
You didn't look up one of our friends?

727
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:02,799
We must've given you fifteen names.

728
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,826
I know, but we got so caught up in the backpacking aspect of it

729
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:07,669
that it just kind of slipped our minds.

730
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,417
You know what that means, Emily. We're going to have to stay

731
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:12,568
with the Gundersons when we go to Zurich in the fall.

732
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,174
Rory, would you like another piece of chicken?

733
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:17,468
- Tiresome people. 
- I've already had two, Grandma.

734
00:33:17,577 --> 00:33:19,282
I'm sorry, why are we friends with them again?

735
00:33:19,434 --> 00:33:21,277
Just take it and nibble at it if you want to.

736
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:23,874
Gerta, you can put the soufflé in now.

737
00:33:24,456 --> 00:33:25,236
Soufflé?

738
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:27,268
Yes, we're going to have a special dessert,

739
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:29,086
something to celebrate your homecoming.

740
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:31,456
Why didn't she put it in the oven when we sat down to dinner?

741
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:32,628
Those things take forever to cook.

742
00:33:32,732 --> 00:33:35,604
You know, every time we go to Paris, I marvel at their ability

743
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:38,779
to turn a simple meal into a three or four hour event.

744
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:40,776
Makes every day seem like a party.

745
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,498
So tonight, I thought we'd be European.

746
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:46,877
I thought maybe we'd have a cheese plate before dessert and coffee.

747
00:33:47,021 --> 00:33:48,352
How does that sound? Bon?

748
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:50,933
Oh, yes. Very... bon.

749
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:53,344
It's nice to mix it up once in awhile.

750
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:56,012
I have a wonderful idea.

751
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:58,905
Rory, have you ever seen a ballroom dancing competition?

752
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,220
No.

753
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:04,347
You would love it. It is so exciting, and the costumes are beautiful.

754
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:07,711
I've been taping them since 1978. Can you imagine?

755
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:09,539
- No. 
- All right, then.

756
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,153
After dessert, you and I are going to hunker down in that den

757
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,571
that we never use and I am pulling out those tapes.

758
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,879
We'll just start at the beginning and see how far we get.

759
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:19,788
Perfect, here's the cheese.

760
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,067
I'll take that, Gerta.

761
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:24,623
Richard, do you want to start?

762
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:31,463
Jeez, you think you go to a fancy school like Yale there'd be a mattress in the room.

763
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,826
Yeah. Go figure, huh?

764
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:35,257
You packed her stuff in Hefty bags?

765
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,208
Hey, she's lucky I even had these in the house.

766
00:34:37,254 --> 00:34:38,488
If you needed luggage, you should've asked me.

767
00:34:38,585 --> 00:34:39,287
You have luggage?

768
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,187
 Yes, I have luggage. Why wouldn't I have luggage?

769
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:44,448
- You never go anywhere. 
- I just went on a seven-country cruise.

770
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:48,164
That's right, the mystery cruise that you don't wanna talk about.

771
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:51,032
I told you I brought luggage. What more info do you need?

772
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,727
Why won't you tell me what happened?

773
00:34:52,814 --> 00:34:54,483
- Because. 
- Why?

774
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:56,219
Luke, I swear, I'm dying to know,

775
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:58,558
but every time I bring it up, you spaz out.

776
00:34:58,646 --> 00:35:00,293
Why won't you tell me? I would tell you.

777
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:01,939
Yes, but I wouldn't wanna know.

778
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:07,744
Did something happen with you and Nicole?

779
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:12,808
What? Did you propose?

780
00:35:19,004 --> 00:35:21,026
Oh my God, you proposed?

781
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:23,463
Yes, I proposed.

782
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:29,193
- This is big. This is huge. 
- There's more.

783
00:35:29,484 --> 00:35:30,221
There's more?

784
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:33,892
Okay, well, what? Did she say yes?

785
00:35:35,657 --> 00:35:38,229
She said yes. You proposed and she said yes.

786
00:35:38,485 --> 00:35:39,533
- Wow, I... 
- There's more.

787
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:42,826
And there's more after you proposed and she said yes? What, you...

788
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:43,825
We got married.

789
00:35:44,424 --> 00:35:47,854
You got married? How could you get married?

790
00:35:47,956 --> 00:35:49,666
We asked the captain and he married us.

791
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:51,213
- And that's legal? 
- Apparently.

792
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:53,661
So you're married? You're legally married?

793
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:57,665
- This is just... 
- Actually, there's a little more.

794
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,525
And she's pregnant. Oh my God, you finally reproduced.

795
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,071
We're getting divorced.

796
00:36:06,502 --> 00:36:10,030
- I'm gonna sit down now. 
- It just all happened so fast.

797
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:10,966
Well, yeah.

798
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:13,695
I mean, you're on this boat in the middle of nowhere and everything's moving

799
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:16,045
and you feel weird all the time.

800
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:18,923
There's this endless supply of food and drink.

801
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:22,046
Midnight buffets, by the way, are the reason the rest of the world hates us.

802
00:36:22,153 --> 00:36:25,020
And everyone around us was either in love, engaged,

803
00:36:25,113 --> 00:36:27,852
or celebrating their hundredth wedding anniversary,

804
00:36:27,923 --> 00:36:30,503
and we were having a good time... and there you go.

805
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:31,216
There you go.

806
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:34,042
Of course, the next morning we both woke up and realized we'd lost our minds.

807
00:36:34,114 --> 00:36:37,176
We tried to ignore it for awhile, you know, went snorkeling,

808
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:40,883
but by the time we hit land, we were separated,

809
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:42,408
and now we're getting divorced.

810
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:45,593
Okay, well, my jet lag and your love life is making me dizzy.

811
00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:48,026
- Is there more? 
- Nope, that's it.

812
00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:52,448
- I'm sorry. 
- Ah, it's okay.

813
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:56,457
Well, look on the bright side.

814
00:36:56,689 --> 00:37:00,958
I mean, now that you've been married, it'll silence all those questions.

815
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:03,251
What questions?

816
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,011
You know, a single man of a certain age who lives alone.

817
00:37:07,512 --> 00:37:08,289
You're kidding.

818
00:37:08,397 --> 00:37:09,995
Hey, I always defended you.

819
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:12,493
I always said, "Hey, so what if he is?"

820
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:13,841
Thank you for your support.

821
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:20,767
- Hello? 
- She's taken me hostage.

822
00:37:20,932 --> 00:37:22,555
- What? 
- She's not letting me leave.

823
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,519
Dinner lasted an hour. She didn't even put the soufflé in the oven

824
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,069
until we'd already finished, and now we're watching

825
00:37:28,157 --> 00:37:32,466
taped ballroom dancing competitions that date back to the 1800's.

826
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:34,628
- You haven't left yet? 
- Are you listening to me?

827
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:37,501
I can't leave. She won't let me leave ever.

828
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:41,116
This is Iran in '79 and you are Jimmy Carter. What do we do?

829
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:43,282
Well, first we have to lose the Jimmy Carter comparison,

830
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:45,267
and second, I have to come get you.

831
00:37:45,385 --> 00:37:47,644
This is about me and me not showing up,

832
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:50,013
so maybe if I put in an appearance, she'll let you go.

833
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:53,157
Okay, but come quickly because she's got a lot of tapes

834
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:55,194
- and they rewind really slow. 
- I'm on my way.

835
00:37:58,008 --> 00:38:01,799
- Hey, so, I have to go get Rory. 
- Everything okay?

836
00:38:02,231 --> 00:38:04,615
Yeah. You know, my mother's a psycho, so...

837
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:05,973
business as usual.

838
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,804
- Thanks for the help. 
- Sure.

839
00:38:08,891 --> 00:38:11,595
- And I am sorry. 
- I'll be fine.

840
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:17,232
Strong wind.

841
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:29,832
Now I think you're really going to see quite a difference from the early eighties.

842
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:32,018
They really start to mix it up in '88.

843
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:34,466
Oh, see right there, see that move?

844
00:38:34,547 --> 00:38:36,032
Five years ago it was not allowed.

845
00:38:36,156 --> 00:38:37,558
Could've gotten you kicked right out.

846
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:39,156
That's harsh.

847
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:42,740
Oh, yes. Ballroom dancing can be very harsh.

848
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:46,140
Oh, look. The couple in the purple feathers

849
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:50,891
- that's Corky and Shirley Ballas. I love them, they are so talented.

850
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:55,088
Corky's actually writing a musical based on their life as ballroom champions,

851
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:58,551
and their son, Corky Jr., is going to play him as a young man.

852
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:01,469
Wow. Two Corky's in one show.

853
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:02,794
Don't see that everyday.

854
00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:06,225
- Mom, hi! 
- There you guys are.

855
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,378
What are you doing here?

856
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,949
Well, you know, it's funny, I just happen to be in the neighborhood

857
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:12,437
and I thought to myself, I wonder what's doing at the Gilmore house.

858
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:14,879
We're watching National Ballroom Dancing competitions.

859
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:15,866
You are?

860
00:39:16,465 --> 00:39:18,947
Well, that sounds fun. Mind if I watch with you?

861
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,310
- I don't think you'd enjoy it. 
- Oh, no, I'm sure I would.

862
00:39:21,411 --> 00:39:22,692
You've already missed the beginning.

863
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,022
I'm betting you could catch me up.

864
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:27,130
Rory, would you go ask Gerta if she would make me some tea?

865
00:39:27,874 --> 00:39:29,794
Sure, Grandma.

866
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:34,120
No, nothing for me, Mom. Thanks.

867
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:36,531
So what's new?

868
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,936
You obviously weren't just in the neighborhood,

869
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,845
so why don't you tell me what you're doing here?

870
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:43,586
You know, I came to see you.

871
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,113
You came to get Rory.

872
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:49,137
Mom, she's been here for hours. Patty Hearst had a shorter incarceration.

873
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,860
She's not being held hostage, Lorelai. I resent that.

874
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:54,706
She's spending time with me, something you obviously don't want to do.

875
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:56,970
Mom, I'm sorry I missed dinner tonight.

876
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:59,725
Come to dinner, don't come to dinner, it makes no difference to me.

877
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:02,132
You are under no obligation to us any longer.

878
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:04,845
- I know, but... 
- You're very busy, I understand.

879
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:06,279
I wouldn't wanna keep you any longer.

880
00:40:06,642 --> 00:40:09,233
Mom, please, let me take Rory with me.

881
00:40:09,381 --> 00:40:11,658
No. Tonight is my night with Rory.

882
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:14,143
You're keeping her from me on purpose.

883
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,850
If Rory wants to leave, she can ask to leave. She's not a four-year old.

884
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,461
She's not gonna hurt your feelings by asking to leave.

885
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:23,309
Why should she? She knows you'll be along any second to do it for her.

886
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:25,571
Mom, why do you always make everything so hard?

887
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:28,638
Don't you understand, this is my last night with my daughter!

888
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,584
She goes off to college tomorrow!

889
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,585
I know, which is why I was so surprised

890
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:33,660
you didn't want to spend the evening with her.

891
00:40:33,738 --> 00:40:35,181
- I do! 
- Then you should've come!

892
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:36,712
- I couldn't! 
- You wouldn't!

893
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,386
I swear to God!

894
00:40:45,974 --> 00:40:46,880
Where's Dad?

895
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:49,195
Oh, he went to bed hours ago.

896
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,106
He went to bed?

897
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,719
Well, it was getting late.

898
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:58,953
Why are you laughing?

899
00:41:02,312 --> 00:41:05,461
You know, you've got Rory locked in here with the Mambo Kings, and...

900
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:10,899
- and Dad went to bed. 
- So what? Why is that funny?

901
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:16,002
Because... you know, she's here and he's there and...

902
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:18,103
God, I'm so tired.

903
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:20,969
- What's so funny? 
- Oh, she's having a fit.

904
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,972
- Mom? 
- Oh my God.

905
00:41:25,925 --> 00:41:26,602
What?

906
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,171
I just got the Jimmy Carter reference.

907
00:41:31,977 --> 00:41:33,559
As soon as you're both done...

908
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,105
Oh, watch this. This part's really good.

909
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,934
- Ouch, that has got to hurt. 
- Cool, huh?

910
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,998
Extremely.

911
00:41:48,727 --> 00:41:52,038
Plus, the whole matching haircut thing adds a level of commitment to their act

912
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,672
that the other acts just lack.

913
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:56,232
Oh, hey, careful where you put the hand there, mister.

914
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:59,053
You know they rehearse every night, plus they have classes,

915
00:41:59,154 --> 00:42:00,727
plus they go to the gym four times a week?

916
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,617
Oh my God, she's balancing on his hand. He is like Superman.

917
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,844
Or Wonder Woman. Either way, he's very strong.

918
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:11,142
So, tomorrow...

919
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:16,425
Yeah, tomorrow.

920
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:17,823
It's a big day.

921
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:22,171
It's a really big day.

922
00:42:24,377 --> 00:42:27,183
I just hope it's everything I've been imagining it to be.

923
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:34,627
I just hope you actually get there.

924
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:47,863
You know, if Sofia could just die during a fox trot, that would be perfect.

925
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:49,317
Biscotti?

926
00:42:50,489 --> 00:42:51,246
Yes, please.

927
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:53,843
They're all broken.

928
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:56,649
I know. I like 'em that way.

929
