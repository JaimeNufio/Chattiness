1
00:00:00,681 --> 00:00:04,219
So the hunter comes out of the tent,
looks around, and says,

2
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:07,321
"ah, very well then.
Now, where's that gorilla?"

3
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:09,831
Well, now you've heard dad's big
game-hunter-and-the-gorilla joke,

4
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:11,157
you're officially
part of the family.

5
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:12,660
It's not too late to back out.

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,572
Yes, Richard, I beg you --
get some new material.

7
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,196
I actually like the joke,

8
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:18,929
and the family is
not bad, either.

9
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:20,514
Thanks for a great meal, Emily.

10
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:21,810
Yes, thank you, grandma.

11
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:24,139
You're quite welcome.
Did you really like the meal?

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,400
It was incredible, mom.

13
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:28,528
On our recent trip to Mexico, your
father and I were served quail Mazatlán,

14
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,851
and I insisted that
Bridget find the recipe.

15
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:31,753
Well, she found it.

16
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:35,093
Yeah. Tell that Bridget that that
quail Mazatlán was a triumph.

17
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:37,730
It's the tequila-cactus
sauce that makes it special.

18
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:39,693
- So special.
- Really just great.

19
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,581
Well, young lady,
I'll see you around the campus.

20
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:42,800
Yes, you will.

21
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:46,272
And Lorelai, it turns out that I have
an emergency D.A.R. board meeting

22
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,183
on tuesday,
so I won't be able to get together

23
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:50,220
to finalize the seating
chart for the party.

24
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:52,260
No seating-chart get-together?
How will I live?

25
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:53,451
I'll help you get through it.

26
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:55,803
Christopher, are you sure
you can't stay for a cigar?

27
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:57,120
Cuban. Montecristo.

28
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:59,653
Perfect complement to
a tequila-cactus sauce.

29
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,123
Dad, we really
have to get going.

30
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:03,991
She's right, but maybe I
could get a Montecristo to go.

31
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,083
Oh, nice try.

32
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:06,363
I thought I'd give it a shot.

33
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:08,413
Another time for cigars.
I'll see you, Rory.

34
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:10,383
- Bye, grandma.
- Bye, bye.

35
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:13,033
- See you in class, Rory.
- See you!

36
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:14,283
Oh, my god!

37
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:16,693
I thought for sure your mom
saw me put mine in here.

38
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,822
How could so tiny a quail
have such a big, awful taste?

39
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:20,521
I think the sauce burned
through my napkin.

40
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:21,693
And now we just throw
it in the bushes?

41
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:23,070
No! We tried that before.

42
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:24,631
The chicken Kiev.
The baava, too.

43
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:26,583
Yeah. The neighbor's cat find it
and dragged it to the back patio.

44
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:27,520
So busted.

45
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:28,652
How do we get rid of it?

46
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:29,791
We take it with us in the car.

47
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:31,663
And we give it the old
heave-ho over Tyler's bridge.

48
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:33,792
Got to make sure we get every
piece in the water, though.

49
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,492
Oh yeah.
One stray piece of quail Mazatlán,

50
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,991
and grandma will have
the river dragged.

51
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:40,413
We need something to weigh them down.
Hey, how attached are you to that watch?

54
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:55,492
Morning!

55
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,433
Ow! What was that for?

56
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,782
Thought maybe I was dreaming.

57
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:01,260
Then you're supposed to
ask me to pinch you.

58
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:02,582
You're not supposed
to pinch me.

59
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:05,430
Well, I'm confused.
I haven't even had my coffee yet.

60
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:09,532
I have your coffee and
muffins hot from the oven.

61
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:12,111
Well, actually, they're not really
muffins. They're muffin tops

62
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:15,383
because the muffin tops are
the only parts you like.

63
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:17,680
You baked me a whole
basket of muffin tops?

64
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,701
Yep.

65
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:21,631
I have got apple-cinnamon-walnut,
lemon-poppy seed,

66
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:24,293
apple spice,
and double chocolate chip,

67
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,353
which is really more
cake than muffin.

68
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:29,223
But if calling them a muffin means
you can eat them in the morning,

69
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:31,043
then I am all for it.

70
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:34,291
So, which would you like?

71
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:35,593
Um,  the cake one, please.

72
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:38,062
Ooh, good choice.

73
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:40,021
Ta-da.

74
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:41,351
Sookie?

75
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,171
What are you doing here?
It's not even 7:00.

76
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:46,460
What?!

77
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,023
Why can't a girl get up
super early on her day off,

78
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:53,043
make some muffin tops,
and bring a hot cup of coffee

79
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:58,060
over to the best friend and business
partner a girl could ever have?

80
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:59,120
I guess.

81
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:00,743
I mean,
I had to get up early anyway.

82
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:03,603
Jackson and I are going skiing.
We're so excited.

83
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,400
We haven't done that
since before the kids.

84
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:07,462
Hmm. That's cool.

85
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:09,070
Yeah, Jackson loves to ski,

86
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:12,122
and I love to dress up in those
cozy clothes, the furry boots,

87
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:14,570
and curl up with
a Sue Grafton mystery.

88
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,261
I got "'R' is for 'ricochet'"
and "'S' is for 'silence.'"

89
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:23,672
If the ski conditions are good, I can get
a good eight hours of Kinsey Millhone in.

90
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:28,180
Yeah, we were so excited.

91
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:29,730
"Were"?

92
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,273
Our, uh,
babysitter called last night,

93
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:35,012
and she's got mono.

94
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:38,853
Yeah. How is that,
uh, muffin top?

95
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,850
It has the faintest
aftertaste of bribe.

96
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,802
I know it's a lot of work to
take care of the kids, and...

97
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,992
and I know that it's your day off, too,
but I would really, really appreciate it,

98
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:51,352
and I would really,
really, really owe you big.

99
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,191
I'd love to take care
of Davey and Martha.

100
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:56,193
Oh, did I happen to mention
that you're the best friend

101
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,293
and business partner a
girl could ever have?

102
00:04:58,308 --> 00:04:59,552
I believe you led with that.

103
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,743
Oh, good, because you are.
Thank you.

104
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:05,373
No problem.
God, this coffee is good.

105
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,280
Well, yeah, it should be.

106
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:10,052
I got it from Luke's.

107
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,682
Sorry. Is that weird?

108
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:13,973
Oh, no, that's not weird.

109
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:15,163
Good.

110
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:16,841
I mean, it shouldn't be weird.

111
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,223
No, it shouldn't be weird.

112
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:21,422
It would be weird if I intentionally
didn't drink the coffee.

113
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:23,921
- That would be weird.
- Yeah, that would be weird.

114
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,293
I mean, it's good coffee.

115
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:27,940
Yeah, and there's no reason you
shouldn't enjoy good coffee.

116
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,683
- Exactly.
- Good.

117
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:31,522
Yeah, so it's not weird.

118
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:33,471
What did you do with
the muffin bottoms?

119
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:35,230
I made a muffin-bottom pie.

120
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:37,403
It's actually pretty good.
I'm thinking about patenting it.

121
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,712
Mmm, muffin-bottom pie --
sounds dirty.

122
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:42,162
Mm-mmm! There are
baked goods in here.

123
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,833
At first I thought
I was dreaming.

124
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,772
- Please don't pinch me.
- When I realized I wasn't,

125
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:48,270
I thought, "somebody must've
broke in here and started baking."

126
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:50,672
Baking and entering --
it's a crime wave sweeping the nation.

127
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:52,051
Just not used to that smell.

128
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,562
Well, enjoy.
Sookie brought us coffee

129
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:57,240
- and freshly baked muffin tops. 
- Muffin tops?

130
00:05:57,258 --> 00:05:59,153
- They are the best part.
- Okay.

131
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,961
You got to be careful, though,
because they induce a sugar coma

132
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,751
where it makes you say,
"yes, yes, anything, yes."

133
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:06,630
I needed her to babysit today.

134
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,381
- You need anything from me?
- Nope.

135
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:10,722
Then we're good to go.
Actually, this is gonna work out well.

136
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:12,792
Ship the daughter unit
off to her grandmother,

137
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,210
get rid of the wife unit,
leaving the husband unit free

138
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,582
to do some good,
old-fashioned manual labor.

139
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:18,940
He's  putting up a flat-screen.

140
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:20,701
Oh, flat-screen what?

141
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,292
Come on. Are you serious?

142
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,433
TV.

143
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,790
- Oh.
- Yeah.

144
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:26,859
You'll see.
You're gonna love it.

145
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,900
Well, I should get going.

146
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:30,668
I have to get ready for skiing.

147
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,693
Oh, hey,
do you have any magazines

148
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,850
in case I get through
both "R" and "S"?

149
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:36,600
- Yeah, on the hall table.
- Okay, great.

150
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:38,722
I'll get them on the way out.

151
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,783
Thank you, Lorelai.

152
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,400
I really, really appreciate it.

153
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,440
It's okay.

154
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:50,560
No, I mean, it takes a special
person to, you know, on her day off.

155
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:53,022
- No problem.
- Okay.

156
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:55,600
Look what you're making me do.

157
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:57,901
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye. Okay.

158
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:00,740
- Okay.
- Bye.

159
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,151
- Bye.
- Bye, Sookie.

160
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:05,983
- What was that?
- I don't know.

161
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:08,851
She's really excited about
her skiing/reading trip.

162
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,290
This is good coffee.

163
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:13,932
It is good.

164
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:15,590
It's from Luke's.

165
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:20,542
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

166
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,930
Sookie brought it.
Are you sure?

167
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,261
Of course.

168
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,970
Why wouldn't it be?

169
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:27,490
Because.

170
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,600
It's fine.

171
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:31,852
Okay.

172
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:34,222
So, what do you do with
the muffin bottoms?

173
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,270
Oh, she turned them into a pie,
you know?

174
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:39,100
She's like an indian.
They use all the parts of the buffalo.

175
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:41,180
I don't fully
understand that woman.

176
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:42,832
She bakes good stuff.

177
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:44,330
That I get.

178
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:16,002
Oh, my god,
The Eagle Has Landed.

179
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:18,040
Yep, they delivered it while
you were in the shower.

180
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:19,382
Did they deliver
it or throw it?

181
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,693
Comes with a lot of equipment.
Isn't it beautiful?

182
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:23,240
Yeah. And big.

183
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,701
All the better to watch Reggie
Bush score touchdowns on.

184
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:28,230
I forget. Which one of the
Bush daughters is Reggie?

185
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,871
You're gonna love it.

186
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:31,253
Hey, have you seen the level?

187
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:33,320
The thing with the green bubble
that goes back and forth?

188
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:33,990
Yeah.

189
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:35,581
Yeah, Paul Anka and I
were playing with it.

190
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,990
You were playing with
it with the dog?

191
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:39,773
Yes. I was trying to 
hypnotize him with the bubble,

192
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,742
see if I could talk him
out of the habit of chewing

193
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:42,992
on the corner of
the welcome mat,

194
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:45,472
or I was gonna give him a
wacky posthypnotic suggestion,

195
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,921
like the doorbell rings,
and he spins around in circles.

196
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:49,212
Were you able to hypnotize him?

197
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:50,761
No, Chris, he's a dog.

198
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:54,473
All right. I think you've got this under
control. I'm gonna go sit on some babies.

199
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:57,112
You do that. When you get back,
we'll sprawl out on the couch

200
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:58,990
and  watch flat-screen
plasma TV,

201
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,610
and the world as you know
it will never be the same.

202
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:03,793
- You smell good.
- Yeah?

203
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,991
Familiar.

204
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,702
Is that my conditioner?

205
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:09,242
Maybe. I don't know.

206
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,961
Are you using my conditioner?

207
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,850
Sometimes. Why?
You don't like to share?

208
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,360
No, I'm married now.
I love to share.

209
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,460
So, why is it so funny?

210
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:17,382
Because you don't have
that much to condition.

211
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:18,522
I know that, but --

212
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:20,342
It's just been really
unruly lately?

213
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:21,932
All right.
I got work to do here.

214
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:24,882
All right, listen,
I love that you're using my conditioner,

215
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:27,910
and I love that you're putting up this
Jumbotron thingy all by yourself,

216
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,430
and I can't wait to come home
and watch flat sports with you,

217
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:31,581
and I love you -- goodbye.

218
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:32,653
I will be here.

219
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:35,800
Hey, if you feel like shaving, I've got
a brand-new lady schick in the drawer.

220
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:36,733
Feel free to use it.

221
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,452
Oh, I might just do that.

222
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:43,901
Danes vs. Nardini?

223
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,103
Custody case.

224
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,582
Oh, yeah, right.
Uh, no, Nardini is not here.

225
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:48,873
Nobody is here.

226
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:52,133
I mean, well,
nobody from -- okay.

227
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,453
Luke.

228
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:55,183
Oh, hey, Jim. Hey.

229
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,351
- Been waiting long?
- No, no, no, I got here early.

230
00:09:57,365 --> 00:10:00,702
I wasn't sure where I was supposed
to park, so I got here early.

231
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:02,561
- Always a good idea.
- Yeah, listen, uh...

232
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:06,232
I meant to ask you --
will I start with a statement?

233
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:08,790
No, no,
you won't start with any statement.

234
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:09,640
Okay.

235
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:12,081
Actually, the less you say,
the better,

236
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,791
which is good because the more you say,
the more they can, well, you know.

237
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:20,201
Right, right. Will they make a
decision right away? Do they tell us?

238
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:22,720
Listen, I got to make a quick call.
Give me a sec?

239
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,661
Oh, yeah, no. Go.
Go right ahead.

240
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,900
Oh, hey.

241
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:33,543
Hello, Luke.

242
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:36,242
They're not -- we're not --

243
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:38,060
Oh, are we early?

244
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,791
Yeah, I guess,
or they're behind.

245
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:55,263
Did you park in the garage?

246
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:58,510
Yeah, do I get this
thing stamped or what?

247
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,621
I don't know.
I didn't park in the garage.

248
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:02,022
Oh. Okay.

249
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:11,022
Man, this place, huh?

250
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,561
Yeah, what a waste of time.

251
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:13,671
Yeah.

252
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:15,853
Especially  since there's
no reason for it.

253
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,360
Well, I mean...

254
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,953
But you have to finish
what you started, right?

255
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:21,540
What I started?

256
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,942
Yes, when you hired a lawyer.

257
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:27,100
Well, I had to hire a lawyer.
It was the only way I could see my kid.

258
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:30,691
I mean, come on.
You really think you have a chance?

259
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:33,431
Yeah, well,
that's for a judge to decide.

260
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:36,363
Well, step back.
Take a look at it.

261
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:39,130
I mean, look at yourself.
You're... you --

262
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:43,841
a hermit living above a diner in
some old, converted hardware store.

263
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:47,201
It doesn't exactly paint a
picture of "capable father."

264
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:49,272
It doesn't matter where I live,

265
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:52,122
and I have been nothing
but a good father to April.

266
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:55,742
And you're not gonna get any points
for your history with women, either.

267
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,732
I don't know what
you're talking about.

268
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:00,432
Bailed on Lorelai,
got divorced in a heartbeat.

269
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:02,943
I did not bail on Lorelai.

270
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:06,230
You have had no long-term
relationships, Luke.

271
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:09,701
Why would a judge trust
you to have one with April?

272
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:12,692
April -- huh! -- knows --

273
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:14,893
Hi. Anna, all set?

274
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,352
Hello, Barbara.

275
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:17,691
Jim.

276
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:19,172
Can we go in?

277
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:20,872
The judge is ready for you.

278
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,492
Perfect timing.

279
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,261
- Hey, Paris.
- Hey, Rory.

280
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:37,700
Just a second.
I'm in the middle of something.

281
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:39,623
- Did you have a good --
- Shh! No.

282
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:43,152
I have to set up that Goldman Sachs
interview before spring break.

283
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:47,833
My Christmas was fine, thank you.
I assume yours was, too?

284
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,501
It was nice.

285
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,152
Good. We've got the pleasantries
out of the way. Can we move on?

286
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:54,873
I hope so.
I am emotionally spent.

287
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:56,051
What's all this?

288
00:12:56,066 --> 00:13:00,491
This is the game plan for what
I call operation finish line.

289
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:01,953
- Need more.
- Okay.

290
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:03,691
We only have five months
left before we leave

291
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:05,721
the warm and comforting
bosom of this university

292
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:08,153
and face the bitterly cold
shoulder of the real world.

293
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,061
- "We"?
- You and I.

294
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:12,320
You're the green marker.
Green was a random choice,

295
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:16,003
not a subtle comment about how inexperienced
you are with real-life matters.

296
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:17,791
Then again, maybe it was.

297
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:21,683
So I applying for an
oceanography fellowship?

298
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:25,670
And I might point out that the application
is due by february 28.

299
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:27,221
But I know nothing
about oceanography.

300
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:29,032
I can't even tell you which
direction the ocean is.

301
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,903
You apply, you get the fellowship,
then you decide if you want it.

302
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,171
I already know I don't want it.

303
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,692
It's a defensive move.
It's like monopoly.

304
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,823
Your little wheelbarrow lands on St.
James place.

305
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:40,250
You think, "I don't really want
St. James place, but I don't want

306
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,991
some other schmo to get it,
so I'll stick a plastic house there."

307
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,173
Am I getting through to you?

308
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:45,901
You're making me want
to play monopoly.

309
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:48,471
Look, come the semester's end,
you're gonna thank me for this chart.

310
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:50,282
We cannot graduate unprepared.

311
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:53,432
Paris, there is no way we're gonna
have time to do all this stuff.

312
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:56,660
I'm not saying it's not gonna be
time-consuming, but there's two of us,

313
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:59,191
so we'll divide it all up and
report back to each other.

314
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:01,182
I think we should have
weekly report-back sessions.

315
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:02,872
How about friday
afternoons at 5:00?

316
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:05,483
There's something to look forward
to at the end of the week.

317
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,273
- Jackson!
- One minute.

318
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,643
- Jackson, get the door!
- One minute!

319
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:21,082
That's okay. I'm fine.

320
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,280
Get the door!

321
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,173
Getting it, getting it.

322
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,430
- Sorry, Lorelai.
- That's okay.

323
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:29,732
I just put Martha down for a nap,
and Sookie is getting dressed.

324
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,481
She's picking out
an outfit now.

325
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:33,773
Thanks again for doing this.

326
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:36,002
Sure. So, where is Davey?

327
00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:38,962
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all day long.

328
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,860
That's too bad. I brought over
something special for him,

329
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:43,160
but if he's not here,
I guess I'll just take it back home.

330
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:44,102
No!

331
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:47,111
Oh, there you are. Here you go.
Check out what's in my bag.

332
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:48,202
So, how's Christopher?

333
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:50,973
Oh, he's good. He's putting up a
ginormous flat-screen as we speak.

334
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,961
Cool. What's the
pixel aspect ratio?

335
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,802
- It's got two remotes.
- I'll ask him.

336
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:56,330
Good idea. Hey.

337
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:57,980
Do you like this sweater on me?

338
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,521
Yeah, honey, it's great.

339
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:01,712
I don't like it.
I'm gonna change.

340
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:04,892
So, the four of us should 
go out sometime soon.

341
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:05,742
Sounds good.

342
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:07,833
I mean, I was gonna ask you
two to join us next week

343
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:09,471
in Woodbury for
couples-bowling night,

344
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:11,432
but you don't really seem like
the couples-bowling type.

345
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,180
Why? What's the
couples-bowling type?

346
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:15,330
I don't know,
sort of boring married people.

347
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,153
But I am a boring
married person now.

348
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:19,171
-  Do you even like bowling?
- Not when I was single,

349
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:21,973
but maybe now that I'm boring and
married, it would be right up my alley.

350
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,931
- You have to wear the shoes.
- Forget it.

351
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:26,421
- How about this?
- Ooh, that I really like.

352
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,511
That's nice,
the style and the color.

353
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:32,100
No, it's all wrong.
I'm gonna change.

354
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:34,091
Is she okay?

355
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,430
Sookie? Um, yeah, she's fine.

356
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,570
So, buddy,
what did Lorelai bring?

357
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:40,332
Her magic socks.

358
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:44,051
I could tell you what they do, but it's
kind of private between me and Davey.

359
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:45,882
Oh, yeah.

360
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:48,890
That's perfect --
perfect, perfect, perfect. Let's go.

361
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,221
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

362
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:51,821
Kinsey Millhone is
waiting for you.

363
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:53,173
You don't think it's
a little too --

364
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,203
No, I love that sweater.
Don't you, Lorelai?

365
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:57,712
Yes, I love, love, love it.

366
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:59,490
Great. See?
Everything is great.

367
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:01,390
See you later, buddy.
Thanks again for doing this.

368
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,232
- Come on. Let's go.
- I can't leave them.

369
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:05,563
- You can.
- No, I can't. They need me.

370
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:07,460
They're going to be fine.
Come on. Let's go.

371
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:09,692
Don't you want mommy to stay
here and play with you?

372
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,060
Wouldn't that be fun?

373
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:13,832
Come on. Let's go hit those
slopes and crack those books.

374
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,352
- Thanks again, Lorelai.
- Okay. Bye.

375
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:19,261
All right. Come here. Let's see
your magic socks. Let's see 'em.

376
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:20,871
Come here.
Where do you want to go?

377
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,433
- The jungle.
- The jungle?

378
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:25,661
You better start kicking.
Start kicking to get to the jungle.

379
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:27,322
Kick! Kick!

380
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:29,451
You got to kick to get there.

381
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:38,403
Don't apologize, Connor. That's
precisely why I have office hours.

382
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:41,863
Oh, and I'm supposed to tell you
that you can also query me by email,

383
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:46,612
although to be honest, I check it about
as often as I do the Daily Racing Form.

384
00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:48,210
Thanks.

385
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:49,421
Yeah.

386
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:53,331
Miss Gilmore,
I believe you're next.

387
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,862
The visiting lecturer
will see you now.

388
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:56,171
Thank you.

389
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,902
Oh, I like your office.
It's cozy.

390
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:03,850
That's one way to
describing it.

391
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:07,281
So, have you come as a loving
granddaughter visiting your grandfather

392
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:10,931
or as an obsequious student trying
to butter up her professor?

393
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,310
Well, I'm not buttering up.

394
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:13,733
Oh, good.

395
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,612
Well, actually --

396
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:17,732
Oh, I thought I smelled butter.

397
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,001
You know my, uh,
roommate, Paris?

398
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:21,810
Oh, I've met Paris.

399
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:24,050
Well, and you don't
have to do this,

400
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:27,593
but she wanted me to ask you if
you might be able to help her

401
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:31,322
to set up an informal
get-together with Dean Kerrigan.

402
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,713
To what end?

403
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:36,782
I think she wants some kind of
recommendation for after graduation.

404
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:38,063
I see.

405
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:41,000
And I guess it wouldn't hurt
for me to meet him, as well.

406
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:42,840
But you don't have to.

407
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:44,791
I suppose I could
speak to Dean Kerrigan.

408
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:46,411
He's an affable gentleman.

409
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:49,122
He's probably not averse to getting
together for wine and cheese

410
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:52,723
and meeting a pair of bright,
soon-to-be graduates. I'll look into it.

411
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:55,821
Really? Okay. Thanks, grandpa.

412
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:59,021
So, I'm looking forward to
having you in class again.

413
00:17:59,037 --> 00:17:59,943
Me too.

414
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,520
I think you'll find this class more
stimulating than last semester's.

415
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:05,750
I'm expanding on some
economic principles here,

416
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:08,960
like pricing strategies under
varying economic conditions

417
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:12,890
that can be actually
useful to -- sorry.

418
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:16,590
I shouldn't bore you until
you're sitting in my class,

419
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:18,002
getting credit for it.

420
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:20,342
No, I'm not bored.
I'm sorry, grandpa.

421
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:22,430
I just have a lot off my mind.

422
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,172
Is everything all right?

423
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,392
I just -- It's senior year,

424
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,663
you know, last semester.

425
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:30,791
There's charts all
over my apartment,

426
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:33,543
and I'm going through
something with a friend, so --

427
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:36,272
- Paris?
- No, someone else.

428
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:41,542
I hurt her feelings, and even after
writing her a very long letter of apology,

429
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:45,513
she hasn't gotten back to me,
and I just feel terrible.

430
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,963
I see.

431
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:49,390
Well, I doubt it's as
bad as you think it is.

432
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:51,411
I'm sure the girl
will get back to you.

433
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:54,161
Maybe she's just a
very slow reader.

434
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:58,810
Oh, honey,
anybody who knows you

435
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:02,273
knows you would never do anything to
purposely hurt someone's feelings.

436
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:04,902
That's just it.
We don't know each other that well.

437
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:07,532
She's a new friend.
We don't have a history.

438
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,261
Well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

439
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:16,210
Rory, you're a person
of great heart

440
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,193
and great character.

441
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,532
And that combination
will always win the day.

442
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:24,283
I hope so.

443
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:29,851
So, can I interest
you in syllabus?

444
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:40,381
I was just trying
to be helpful.

445
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:42,120
Cut it out. You're bugging me.

446
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,901
Hi. Wow, you're home early.

447
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,412
I'm sorry it's such a mess.

448
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:48,681
Um, the magic socks
took us back in time.

449
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:51,732
We were cavemen. It was really bleak,
so we lived like this.

450
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:53,580
I would've cleaned up,
but when they woke up,

451
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:56,202
the magic socks were gonna take
us to an orphanage in England

452
00:19:56,217 --> 00:20:00,092
where they had to tidy up in
exchange for one teaspoon of gruel.

453
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:01,350
Sounds fun.

454
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,612
Don't worry about the mess.

455
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,812
So, how was the skiing/reading?

456
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,463
Oh, uh, terrible.

457
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:08,852
Oh, come on.
You had fun all morning.

458
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,553
I could've had fun all day.

459
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:13,310
We meet up for lunch. He spills
my hot toddy all over the table,

460
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:14,930
and he won't let me
order another one.

461
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:16,523
- "Let you"?
- Yeah, let me.

462
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,372
He said if I ordered another one,
he'd just do it again.

463
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:21,010
I just don't think drinking
is appropriate at lunch.

464
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:22,473
It was one drink.

465
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,421
Sometimes that's all it takes.

466
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:26,131
And he wouldn't let me ski.

467
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:28,012
- You mean read?
- No. Ski.

468
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,141
"'S' is for 'silent'" sucked,
so I thought,

469
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:33,153
"why don't I strap on some skis
and try a little downhill?"

470
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:35,523
This one wouldn't let me.

471
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:38,203
Conditions were terrible.
It was really icy.

472
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:40,481
Well, apparently you make all the rules,
your highness.

473
00:20:40,495 --> 00:20:43,292
Could I go check on my children?
Could I do that, huh?

474
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,532
No, that's fine. Sounds good.

475
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:50,983
So, thanks a lot for sitting.

476
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,820
We really appreciate it.

477
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,982
Jackson, seriously,
what's going on with you two?

478
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:57,422
Nothing much. You?

479
00:20:57,435 --> 00:21:00,360
Jackson, why wouldn't
you let her drink?

480
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:02,733
- It's a bad precedent.
- Or ski?

481
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:04,901
I didn't want her to get hurt.

482
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,753
There's all these snowboarders
on the hill these days,

483
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:08,442
and they just come
tearing down --

484
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,830
Jackson, what is
going on with you two?

485
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:12,071
Nothing.

486
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,670
- You're acting strange.
- No, I'm not.

487
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:17,180
So is Sookie.
She's all weird and moody.

488
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:18,702
The last time she was like that,
she was pregnant.

489
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,151
- What?
- What?

490
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,323
- What?
- No.

491
00:21:21,338 --> 00:21:22,551
- No.
- No

492
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:23,613
Maybe?

493
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,320
Jackson, I thought
you got a vasectomy.

494
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:26,962
Oh, so she says,
"go get a vasectomy,"

495
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:28,652
and I'm just supposed
to go get a vactomy?

496
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,132
No, you shouldn't do it if
you didn't want to do it,

497
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,221
but if you didn't want to do it, you
should've told her you didn't want to do it.

498
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,773
I didn't see the point.

499
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:35,933
- Now I see the point.
- Jackson.

500
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:39,033
She said she was staying on the pill.
She said it gave her skin a healthy glow.

501
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,472
Yeah, she went
off it last month.

502
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:42,063
I know that now.

503
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:43,933
You'd think that's the kind of
thing a wife would tell her husband.

504
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,501
Not when she thinks the
husband had a vasectomy.

505
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:46,501
I know. I know.

506
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:48,173
Jackson, you have to
tell her she's pregnant.

507
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,672
I was going to today
after we had a great time

508
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:51,752
and she was in a great mood,

509
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,403
but then she wanted
to ski and drink.

510
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,333
- Well, you wouldn't let her.
- She's pregnant.

511
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:56,501
I know that and you know that,

512
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:58,743
but don't you think Sookie should
be let in on the good news?

513
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,333
All right, all right.

514
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:02,831
- Good luck.
- Yeah. Thanks.

515
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:09,211
Honey? Honey?

516
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:17,933
No!

517
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:20,643
You can't just order someone
to go get a vasectomy...

518
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:23,810
You know what?
J-Just be really quiet right now!

519
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:25,210
...like it's a haircut.

520
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:27,091
Don't speak. Don't breathe.

521
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:29,512
Don't even look at me.
I'm gonna go for a walk,

522
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:32,222
and while I'm gone,
you're gonna have that taken care of.

523
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:33,900
- But --
- No. No talking.

524
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,393
Just do it,
or when get home, I will.

525
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:38,152
Lorelai, let's go!

526
00:22:43,376 --> 00:22:45,951
As we all know, your honor,
custody cases must center

527
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,121
on what's in the best
interest of the child.

528
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,893
And as we all know,

529
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:52,893
"best interest" is
a subjective term.

530
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:55,900
For Mr. Danes to have as much
access to April as he's seeking

531
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,272
would certainly not be
in her best interest.

532
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:00,201
To deny the child
access to her father

533
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:01,910
would be
psychologically damaging.

534
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:05,311
Why? The child has only seen Mr.
Danes on sporadic occasions

535
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:08,161
whenever he found time in his
schedule to allow her to visit.

536
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:11,631
He made himself available to
her as often as she liked.

537
00:23:11,648 --> 00:23:13,523
Truth be told,
during the past year,

538
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:15,633
April has spent more
cumulative hours

539
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:19,362
with the man who drives her
school bus than with Luke Danes.

540
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:23,161
Why don't we ask my client to allow the
bus driver shared custody of the child?

541
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:24,770
Bit of a stretch there,
miss Campbell.

542
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:26,780
My point, your honor,
is that April's connection

543
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:29,953
to Mr.
Danes is superficial at best.

544
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:32,180
To her,
he's a man who works in a diner

545
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:35,391
who only recently revealed
himself to be her father.

546
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:38,280
Owns. I own the diner.

547
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:41,140
I don't just work there,
and April came to me.

548
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:42,730
Yeah, without my knowing it.

549
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:45,301
Exactly. You had no intention of
letting me know I had a daughter.

550
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:46,530
Excuse me.

551
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:48,731
I suggest you let your
attorneys speak for you.

552
00:23:48,745 --> 00:23:51,670
It is why you pay them all
your hard-earned money.

553
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:53,801
I apologize, your honor.

554
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:55,862
Yeah. Sorry.

555
00:23:56,745 --> 00:24:00,081
I just -- and he really --
ohh! You know?

556
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:04,513
And he didn't, and then I-I
can't believe that he -- ohh!

557
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,833
Ooh! You know, 'cause he didn't have --
He didn't.

558
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,661
And I can't believe
that he could've.

559
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:10,811
You know you can't walk
off a pregnancy, right?

560
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,990
I had just delivered his baby,
and then what?

561
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:14,860
I'm supposed to go and
hold my husband's hand

562
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:17,161
while he get's a vasectomy
to make sure he does?

563
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:19,183
No. It's too much.

564
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:22,081
I mean, I-I-I'm not his mother.
I'm already a mother.

565
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:25,213
I don't have the time
to baby a grown man.

566
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:26,293
I know.

567
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:28,673
What am I supposed to do --
start watching him brush his teeth?

568
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:30,123
Does he want me to
start cutting his meat?

569
00:24:30,157 --> 00:24:32,020
I don't think he wants
his meat cut at all.

570
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:33,742
Well, how could he do this?

571
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:36,092
I guess he didn't really
want to have a vasectomy.

572
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,563
- Well, then, tell me.
- I agree.

573
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:40,502
- Uhh!
- I know. Uhh!

574
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:43,462
I didn't --
There was less than 4,000 left.

575
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:45,863
- 4,000?
- Diapers, diapers.

576
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:49,190
For the last year and a half,
I've been changing 20 diapers a day,

577
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,881
and finally --
finally I've got Davey.

578
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:55,301
He's potty-trained. It's good.

579
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:58,222
Martha has always gone
through a little more.

580
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:00,053
I mean, girls --
it's a boy-girl thing. I don't know.

581
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:02,831
Boys seem to be perfectly happy
sitting in their own filth.

582
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:03,793
I didn't know that.

583
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:06,232
Yeah, and Martha is
12 diapers a day.

584
00:25:06,246 --> 00:25:08,173
And then if you add the --
but that's not the point.

585
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,642
The point is that there was a
light at the end of the tunnel,

586
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:13,643
and now the light at the end of the
tunnel is no more because you can't
do that

587
00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:16,331
with 23 diapers a day. 26.

588
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:18,352
If it's a girl,
that's 26 diapers a day.

589
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:20,612
You could use cloth diapers, you know?
You wash them and --

590
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:24,002
That's not the point. That's not the
point. I get it. That's a lot of diapers.

591
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,622
But you know,
babies are more than diapers, right?

592
00:25:26,637 --> 00:25:28,792
- No, no.
- Sookie.

593
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:30,910
No, all I remember is eat,
sleep, poop.

594
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:32,401
Well, there's other stuff.

595
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:36,043
Yeah, like diaper rash and
colic and potty-training.

596
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:37,353
No, the good stuff.

597
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:39,721
Well, I'm having trouble
remembering that.

598
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,871
For one thing,
they're pretty cute.

599
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,772
Well, but cute is not gonna help
me sleep through the night.

600
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:49,031
They smell great -- that newborn smell.
I mean, you can't beat that, right?

601
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:50,902
The smell is pretty good.

602
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:54,992
How about, you know,
when you give them their first bath?

603
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:57,231
I remember when I gave
Rory her first bath,

604
00:25:57,246 --> 00:25:59,243
she looked up at me like,
"what the hell is going on?"

605
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,602
And I kept saying, "I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

606
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:03,523
Davey loved his first one.

607
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:06,533
Martha screamed bloody murder.
Oh, my god, all the screaming.

608
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:09,142
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but how about the first time

609
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:11,973
when they're crying and crying,
and you go in to pick them up,

610
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,542
and then they stop crying
because they recognize you?

611
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,171
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

612
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:18,530
I'm not gonna sleep, though.

613
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:22,161
Well, you won't sleep,
but you'll get another first smile.

614
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,320
You know,
Davey had his at three weeks.

615
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:26,071
It's really advanced.

616
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:29,093
How about when you're lying down,
you're holding the baby,

617
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:31,203
and the baby falls
asleep on your chest?

618
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:33,231
They're all warm and cuddly.

619
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:36,023
Oh, god, I know what you're doing.
You're trying to make this sound good.

620
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:38,580
In the middle of the night,
when you're rocking the baby,

621
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:43,162
and everyone is asleep. And then they
fall asleep, and you fall asleep.

622
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:46,080
I'm hormonal,
and you are playing dirty.

623
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:48,100
It's pretty good stuff, huh?

624
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:49,572
I guess.

625
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,303
Really good.

626
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:53,682
Are you talking memory,
or are you thinking ahead?

627
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:56,202
Oh, uh, I don't know --
a little of both, I guess.

628
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:57,212
Really?

629
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:59,810
Well, the subject has come up.
It might come up again.

630
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:02,092
Oh, my god,
I'm gonna have another baby.

631
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:05,680
Yes, and I will be there to help you.
No muffin tops required.

632
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:07,311
Thank you. I know.

633
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh, god, I hope I have a girl.
Ooh! Or a boy.

634
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:13,193
Well, chances are pretty good
you'll have one or the other.

635
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,740
So, we seem to have a block of
eight days here in late march

636
00:27:16,757 --> 00:27:18,912
that is disturbingly free
of résumé-building activity.

637
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,371
Might be a good time to commit
to some volunteer work.

638
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:24,630
I'm not crazy about wheeling
around elderlies in bathrobes,

639
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:26,403
so I'm leaning
towards tree planting.

640
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:27,261
Sounds good.

641
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,721
I'll check out some
community-service sites online.

642
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:32,962
I found out the cutoff for the Lawrence
Way journalism fellowship application

643
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:35,053
is march 1st,
so we have to get on that.

644
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:38,012
And... Oh, have you written your
sample for the Iowa poetry prize?

645
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:39,981
Yeah, I think that one's
a little farfetched.

646
00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:42,590
I mean, I only took one poetry class --
sophomore year.

647
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:45,161
Hannah Freeman is applying for a
Fulbright to study space travel

648
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:46,212
in Luneberg, Germany.

649
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:47,702
Do you think she's ever
traveled to space?

650
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:49,591
Besides, the writing
sample is a poem --

651
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:51,723
takes 20 minutes to write,
2 if it's haiku.

652
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:52,603
I know, but --

653
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:54,091
You could've told me you were
going to be so resistant

654
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:55,972
to operation finish line
when we agreed to it.

655
00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:57,493
I'm sorry.
When did we agree to it?

656
00:27:57,507 --> 00:28:00,141
And this is not about making charts.
It's about our careers.

657
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:02,382
It's about life.
I'm trying to help you here.

658
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:05,600
Did you talk to your grandfather about
hooking me up with Dean Kerrigan?

659
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:09,033
Hmm? Hum, yeah, I did.
I did that.

660
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:09,940
And?

661
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,640
Um, he said he'd look into it.

662
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:13,582
"Look into it"?
That's not going to cut it.

663
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:15,291
You have got to put
the screws to the guy.

664
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:17,420
I don't care if he's your grandfather.
He's part of our game plan,

665
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:20,061
and he's got to play ball.
Why do you keep...

666
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:21,810
- Is that Lucy?
- Yeah.

667
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:23,722
- Have you heard from her yet?
- No.

668
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,873
Oh, so now she's decided
to just ignore you?

669
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,052
How very "Heathers" of her.

670
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,583
I don't think she saw me.

671
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,870
Paris, no.

672
00:28:33,176 --> 00:28:35,772
Okay, look,
it's time to put an end

673
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:37,800
to this little junior-high
game you're playing.

674
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,722
Hey, Paris.

675
00:28:39,735 --> 00:28:41,481
Have you read Rory's
letter or not?

676
00:28:41,496 --> 00:28:43,191
Um, yeah, I just --

677
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:45,413
Would you please tell her you
forgive her and kiss and make up,

678
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:46,962
because it's really
messing with her head?

679
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:48,593
Um, sorry, Lucy, I didn't --

680
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,753
Don't apologize.
I've got her on the ropes.

681
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:53,620
I just got back an hour ago,
so just read your letter.

682
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:54,681
Yeah? And?

683
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:57,362
Well, it's not really fair,
I mean, you being a writer.

684
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,293
Yeah, yeah, life's not fair.

685
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:01,140
Can you let her off the hook,
for god's sakes?

686
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:03,010
In case you didn't know it,
Rory is a great person,

687
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,701
and she does not deserve
to be treated this way.

688
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:06,922
Anyone should fell lucky
to call her a friend.

689
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:09,301
I know I do, and you're
throwing away one of the best.

690
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,882
Paris, please.
I appreciate where this is coming from,

691
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:13,952
but can we just have a minute?

692
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:18,741
It was a really
beautiful letter.

693
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:19,680
Thanks.

694
00:29:19,698 --> 00:29:23,681
Look, I know that Marty put you
in a really crappy position.

695
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,720
Yeah, but I -- Well, he did.

696
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:26,782
Totally crappy.

697
00:29:26,796 --> 00:29:28,373
But I could've said,

698
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:30,290
"no, Marty,
you're being stupid and immature."

699
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:31,640
Which he was so being.

700
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:33,741
But I just --
I handled it wrong. I mean,

701
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:36,120
can I say again how
much I screwed up?

702
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:37,623
No, you didn't screw up.

703
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:40,520
Marty asked you to do something
really weird and wrong,

704
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:43,521
and you did it 'cause
you're a great person.

705
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:44,662
Ask Paris.

706
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:46,100
Well, I don't know about --

707
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,933
I even tried to figure out what
I would've done in your shoes,

708
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:53,162
and, I mean, I even tried to act it out
with Olivia playing the role of Marty.

709
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,521
- Seriously?
- I know, right?

710
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:56,113
Any chance to act.

711
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:59,553
But it didn't really work
because as much as I love Olivia,

712
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:01,903
her Marty was so over-the-top.

713
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:04,343
Are things okay
with you and Marty?

714
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:06,450
Not so much. We broke up.

715
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:08,140
Oh, no.

716
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,050
Oh, well, right?

717
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:12,952
I'm so, so sorry.

718
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:15,382
No, I mean,
it wasn't your fault.

719
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:17,201
It wasn't meant to be.

720
00:30:18,286 --> 00:30:20,610
Listen, I got to go
to my first class.

721
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,230
- Oh, yeah, okay.
- But I'll call you, okay?

722
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:25,422
Okay. Yeah. See you.

723
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:30,742
- Everything okay now?
- Yep.

724
00:30:30,757 --> 00:30:33,713
Good. Did you ask her about
actresses she knows at Yale Dramat?

725
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:36,651
Why have I even bothered
to do all this?

726
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,621
Yeah. There we go.

727
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:50,811
What?

728
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:52,690
That's straight.

729
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:54,120
It's straight.

730
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,720
Fine, you want to prove it?
I'll find a level and prove it.

731
00:31:00,915 --> 00:31:03,331
Where's the level, Paul Anka?

732
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:05,962
The level!

733
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:07,740
Find the level, boy!

734
00:31:08,155 --> 00:31:10,313
All right.
You've been absolutely no help.

735
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:16,703
All right, now, miss Nardini,
what kind of provisions

736
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:18,511
have you made for your
daughter in New Mexico --

737
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,032
house, schools?

738
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,332
I've already rented a
house in a nice area,

739
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,600
checked out the
immediate neighborhood,

740
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:28,103
and there's a lot of kids
there that are April's age.

741
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:32,473
I have enrolled her in a local school
that is very highly recommended,

742
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:34,730
um, put her up for swim team.

743
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:36,772
Your honor,
we don't contest that miss Nardini

744
00:31:36,788 --> 00:31:39,331
will make April's transition
to the new living situation

745
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:41,140
as seamless as possible.

746
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:45,173
We contest the part where she cuts
the child off from her father.

747
00:31:45,185 --> 00:31:48,451
A father she barely knows,
who does not have -- let's face it --

748
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:50,601
the most sterling
personal history.

749
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,620
Okay. Look.
I know what you're talking about,

750
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:54,840
and, yeah,
I've made a few mistakes.

751
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:56,210
- Luke, hang on.
- It's true.

752
00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:58,680
I was married before,
and it only lasted a few months,

753
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:00,793
but it ended amicably...
pretty much.

754
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:02,340
Mr. Danes, I need you to --

755
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:03,920
I may live above a diner,

756
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:06,001
and some people may
see me as a hermit.

757
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:07,370
And I'm the first
person to admit

758
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,691
that all of my relationships
haven't exactly been long-term.

759
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:12,341
Mr. McNally.

760
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:14,310
Yeah, you know,
but this is different.

761
00:32:14,328 --> 00:32:16,301
We are talking
about my daughter,

762
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:19,160
who I didn't even know I had for
the first 12 years of her life.

763
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:21,090
And now that I know her,
and I know I'm her dad,

764
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,673
I just want to be with
her and be her dad

765
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:26,143
'cause I know I
will be a good dad.

766
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:28,642
Mr. Danes, be quiet.

767
00:32:28,658 --> 00:32:32,463
I'm sorry, your honor.
This won't happen again.

768
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,673
All right.

769
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:10,111
Now that I've had the opportunity to
hear from both sides in this case,

770
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:14,090
I'm going to read some personal
references into the court record.

771
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:18,570
The first letter is written
on behalf of Mr. Danes

772
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:20,551
by a miss Lorelai Gilmore.

773
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:24,162
This is dated january 9, 2007.

774
00:33:24,358 --> 00:33:26,331
"To whom it may concern,

775
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:29,090
"in the nearly 10 years that
I have known Luke Danes,

776
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:32,290
"I have come to know him as
an honest and decent man.

777
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:36,201
"He's also one of the most kind
and caring persons I have ever met.

778
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:39,242
"I'm a single mother,
and I raised my daughter by myself,

779
00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:41,742
"but once Luke Danes became
my friend in this town,

780
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:43,750
"I never really felt alone.

781
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:46,303
"Luke and I have had our ups
and downs over the years,

782
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:49,172
"but through it all, his relationship
with my daughter, Rory,

783
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:50,803
"has never changed.

784
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:53,552
"He's always been there
for her no matter what.

785
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,432
"He was there to
celebrate her birthdays.

786
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:58,750
"He was there cheering her on
at her high school graduation.

787
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:02,183
"Luke has been a sort of father
figure in my daughter's life.

788
00:34:02,197 --> 00:34:04,731
"With his own daughter,
Luke wasn't given the opportunity

789
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:06,843
"to be there for
her first 12 years,

790
00:34:06,857 --> 00:34:09,663
"but he should be given
that opportunity now.

791
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:12,051
"Once Luke Danes
is in your life,

792
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:13,913
"he is in your life forever.

793
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:17,760
"I know from personal experience
what an amazing gift that is,

794
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:20,381
"and not to allow him
access to his daughter

795
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:24,493
"would be to seriously deprive
her of all this man has to offer,

796
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:26,542
"and he offers so much.

797
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:28,271
"Thank you for your time.

798
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:31,320
"Sincerely, Lorelai Gilmore."

799
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,382
Hiya!

800
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:05,353
I want to see the TV.

801
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,802
Holy cripes, that's big.

802
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,413
Oh, my gosh.
Does that come with a slushee machine

803
00:35:12,427 --> 00:35:14,700
and a gangly teenage Usher?

804
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:17,382
Honey, the deal with Sookie...

805
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:22,030
Chris?

806
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:23,711
I read your letter.

807
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:26,780
Honey, it's not a letter.
It's just a character reference

808
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:29,333
that Luke asked me to
write for his court case.

809
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:31,092
Reads like a letter.

810
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:32,091
Oh, yeah?

811
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:34,072
Almost like a love letter.

812
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,093
No, it's a favor that Luke
asked 'cause he needed --

813
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:40,740
You know what? Before you go
through a whole list of excuses,

814
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:42,481
let me just ask --

815
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:46,730
is our marriage for you
basically just marking time?

816
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:48,833
- What.
- Come on, Lore.

817
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:50,131
Of course not.

818
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,652
Obviously you still have very
deep feelings for the guy.

819
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:56,512
No, no, I just have known
him a long time, and he's...

820
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:59,902
Always been there,
always will be there.

821
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:03,372
Luke needed a character
reference for court

822
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:05,980
to prove that he deserves
partial custody of April,

823
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,520
and I know him really well.

824
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:08,711
Yes, you do.

825
00:36:08,727 --> 00:36:10,532
And so it just made sens
that he would ask me

826
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,211
to write that
character reference.

827
00:36:12,227 --> 00:36:14,670
I can't believe I just
had coffee from his place.

828
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:17,660
Coffee? Sweetie,
I told you Sookie brought that, okay?

829
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,713
Do you still talk to him?
I mean, do you see him?

830
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:21,953
This is crazy.

831
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:23,660
Hey, I got a right.

832
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:25,810
I have a right to know.

833
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:29,321
Occasionally I see him because
we live in the same town.

834
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:31,070
- Yeah, and I know you, Lore.
- And?

835
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:33,023
And I know that you're
not done with him.

836
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:35,331
Okay, this is ridiculous.
This is -- Hey.

837
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:37,151
This is a ridiculous
conversation, okay?

838
00:36:37,168 --> 00:36:40,441
I have a history with him, yes.
I was engaged to him, yes.

839
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,180
But I married you.

840
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:44,151
Tell me you're not
in love with him.

841
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,923
I'm not in love with him.

842
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:50,540
I should've known.
I mean, all the signs were there.

843
00:36:50,557 --> 00:36:51,640
What signs?

844
00:36:51,655 --> 00:36:54,091
The fact that you didn't
want to leave Stars Hollow,

845
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:55,811
that you were dead set
against redoing the wedding,

846
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:57,861
that you didn't want to
have a baby with me.

847
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,383
I mean,
it's all because of him, right?

848
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:02,191
No. How can I tell --
It's over, okay?

849
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:04,681
What I had with him,
it's over, Chris.

850
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,682
Then why did you hide
the letter from me?

851
00:37:06,696 --> 00:37:10,011
I wasn't hiding it. I put it in the
drawer in case they lost the typed copy

852
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:11,932
or the judge spilled coffee on it,
the dog ate it.

853
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:13,372
I don't know why I didn't
tell you about it.

854
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:15,512
I think that it's because
you're still in love with him.

855
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:17,181
No, I love you. I love you.

856
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:19,060
You know what?
I-I'm sorry, Lore.

857
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:20,991
I just -- I can't handle this.

858
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:23,523
- Handle what?
- This. You and him.

859
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:27,122
I just -- I can't handle
being your second choice.

860
00:37:27,138 --> 00:37:30,123
I thought I could,
but I can't, all right?

861
00:37:30,237 --> 00:37:32,111
I can't be your rebound.

862
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:33,653
I'm sorry.

863
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:39,762
Christopher?

864
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:42,671
Chris?

865
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:51,672
Okay, I will check out the
poposaurus project at the peabody,

866
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,322
but there is no way I'm
signing up for the lsats.

867
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:56,161
Sure you are.
Don't get lazy on me now.

868
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,490
The finish line is in sight.

869
00:37:57,507 --> 00:37:58,863
I'm not being lazy, Paris.

870
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,630
I'm not interested in being a lawyer.
I'm interested in journalism.

871
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,860
Just because you go to law school doesn't
mean you have you have to be a lawyer.

872
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:06,233
Look at Dan Abrams -- he's a journalist
-- but because of his law degree,

873
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:08,080
he became the face of
the Scott Peterson trial.

874
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:09,962
I don't want to be the face
of the Scott Peterson trial,

875
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:13,480
and I hate Dan Abrams.
I will also not be taking the mcats.

876
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:16,191
Sanjay Gupta,
senior medical correspondent at CNN.

877
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:17,532
Right now,
he's got the market cornered.

878
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:19,091
Well, good for Sanjay.

879
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:21,911
Hello?

880
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,520
Oh, hey, Lucy.

881
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:24,960
Now?

882
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:28,120
Um, yeah, yeah.
No, that sounds great.

883
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:29,872
I'll see you there. Okay. Bye.

884
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:32,380
Grab your coats.
We're going tray sledding.

885
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:32,983
What?

886
00:38:32,996 --> 00:38:34,931
We're gonna meet Lucy
over at the dining hall,

887
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:37,742
sneak out a couple of trays, and
then go tray sledding down Science Hill.

888
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:38,981
We can cross it off the list.
Come on.

889
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,412
But tray sledding isn't slated
to happen for a few more weeks.

890
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:44,301
Well, that's okay, 'cause there might
not be as much snow in a couple weeks.

891
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:47,232
And Lucy and Olivia happen to
be going today, so let's go.

892
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:48,442
Are you sure you want
me to come with you?

893
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:50,673
- Paris.
- Okay, okay.

894
00:38:51,987 --> 00:38:53,683
Hey, uh, listen.

895
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:56,440
Thanks for saying those things you
said about me in the cafeteria.

896
00:38:56,455 --> 00:39:00,121
Oh, well, I just didn't want your juvenile
hysterics to muck up the whole chart.

897
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:00,902
I know.

898
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,272
You two were behaving
like children.

899
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,211
I thought I was gonna have to
put you on the naughty step.

900
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:07,002
Still, it's just nice
to hear sometimes.

901
00:39:07,018 --> 00:39:08,233
You're not going to cry,
are you?

902
00:39:08,267 --> 00:39:09,832
- No, I don't think so.
- Good.

903
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,770
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

904
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:12,373
Let's go. Oh, wait.

905
00:39:12,386 --> 00:39:14,470
If you fall and break your face,
as many tray sledders do,

906
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:16,602
don't worry about it 'cause you can
spend the night in the infirmary,

907
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:19,172
which is another typical
college experience.

908
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:20,770
Wait. What?

909
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:21,943
Come on.

910
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:52,993
Hello?

911
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:54,951
Hey, I didn't wake you, did I?

912
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:58,421
Uh, no, hi. No, I'm up.

913
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,903
I just had to tell you. I won.

914
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:02,591
You won?

915
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,550
It's incredible.
I thought I was screwed.

916
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:09,312
I mean, her lawyer dug up every last
bit of dirt she could find on me, but...

917
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:12,050
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Luke, that's great.

918
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:15,263
Yeah, the judge waited until this
morning to give us her decision.

919
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:17,740
Oh, man, was that the longest
night of my life. But...

920
00:40:17,757 --> 00:40:21,021
I just got off with my lawyer.
I get shared custody.

921
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:23,291
Wow. Congratulations.

922
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:25,671
Yeah, I get to see April at
least one weekend a month,

923
00:40:25,686 --> 00:40:27,961
every other major holiday,
half the summer.

924
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:30,332
We're gonna work it all out.
It's so great.

925
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:31,912
So great.

926
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:34,362
Yeah, I guess the judge just took
everything into consideration

927
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,821
and realized how much I
wanted to be in April's life.

928
00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:40,580
And, of course,
your letter was a big help.

929
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:45,441
Well, I just wanted to help you,
help April.

930
00:40:45,455 --> 00:40:48,340
Well, you did,
and I'm really grateful.

931
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:51,730
Anyway, uh,
sorry to call so early.

932
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:53,262
Thanks again.

933
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,092
Congratulations.

934
00:41:02,516 --> 00:41:06,812
Now, when it comes to papers,
I'm guessing that some of you,

935
00:41:06,826 --> 00:41:09,760
of course,
will be asking me for an extension.

936
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:11,330
You will be happy to learn

937
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:13,832
that I have no problem
with extensions.

938
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,481
Here's what you do.

939
00:41:15,498 --> 00:41:17,222
You look at the due
date of the paper,

940
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:21,033
and then you mark it on your calendar
two weeks prior to that date.

941
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:22,411
And there you have it.

942
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:24,541
I've just granted you
a two-week extension.

943
00:41:24,556 --> 00:41:27,551
By the way, my office hours
are every tuesday morning,

944
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:31,040
and you're welcome to come to me
with any questions or problems,

945
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:34,871
economic or non, my expertise
extends beyond Keynesian theory,

946
00:41:34,888 --> 00:41:37,742
and I will be happy
to lend an ear.

947
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,142
So, let's get started.

948
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:43,691
As you know, this course...

949
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,940
will take a specific look at...

950
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:48,790
processes and determinants...

951
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:51,343
of overall economic p...

952
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:02,110
Someone call 911!
