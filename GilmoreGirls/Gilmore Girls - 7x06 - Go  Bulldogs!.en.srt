1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,519
Hello?
Gilmore residence.

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:04,980
Hey, mom, it's me.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,362
I just wanted to
leave you a message

4
00:00:06,392 --> 00:00:09,255
letting you know that unfortunately,
I will not be able to come by tonight

5
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:11,008
to take a look at
your new curtains.

6
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:12,381
Lorelai, it's me.

7
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:15,198
- So, sorry I missed you, but --
- You didn't miss me.

8
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,651
For heaven's sakes,
I'm right here.

9
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,106
- Hello?
- Hello? Lorelai?

10
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,410
- Hello?
- Hello?

11
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:21,124
Huh. That's weird.

12
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:23,154
I don't know if your
machine just cut me off.

13
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:24,621
Is something wrong
with this phone?

14
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:26,511
Anyway, uh, something came up,

15
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:29,302
and I just have to take a rain
check on the curtain check.

16
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:30,910
I'm sure they're beautiful.

17
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:32,823
No one knows how to pick
out curtains like you.

18
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:33,923
You're the curtain queen.

19
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,010
Hello? Lorelai,
can you hear me?

20
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:38,213
Anyway, have a good night,
curtain queen.

21
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:40,032
Give my best to dad. Bye.

22
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:42,730
Lorelai? Hello? Hello?

23
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,833
See? I told you it would work.

24
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,742
Wow. How did you
even think to --

25
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:49,842
Well, it's natural instincts
honed by years of experience.

26
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:50,760
Wow.

27
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:52,782
Yeah. Fight or flight, you know.
Fight or flight.

28
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:53,903
And I just did my nails, so...

29
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,473
- Flight.
- Flight.

30
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:57,260
Wow.

31
00:01:56,787 --> 00:02:00,150
Où est la station de
métro la plus proche ?

32
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:03,203
"Where is the nearest
subway station?"

33
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:04,322
Yeah.

34
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:07,490
Ou est-ce que je peux
acheter un billet ?

35
00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:11,233
- "Where can I buy a ticket?"
- The hunter and gatherer has returned.

36
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:13,253
Hey. Listen to how
good I've gotten.

37
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:16,453
Pouvez-vous me donner un plan de métro,
s'il vous plaît ?

38
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:19,580
"Could I have a map of
the subway, please?"

39
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:23,303
Could I have a map of
the subway, please?

40
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:24,543
- Impressive.
- Right?

41
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:26,353
I'm practically fluent.

42
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:28,802
Thank you for the
coffee and croissant.

43
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,333
De rien.

44
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:31,833
"You're welcome."

45
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,353
Duh.

46
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:36,112
I thought our stomachs should
start adjusting to french cuisine,

47
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:38,642
so I got croissants
and café au lait.

48
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:40,120
I thought café au
lait was spanish.

49
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:42,581
No, it's french for "coffee
and milk." "Lait" is "milk."

50
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:47,770
Really? I thought it was "café
olé," like, "coffee! All right!"

51
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:49,290
You're kidding.

52
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:51,670
You're not kidding.
You are. You're kidding.

53
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:52,821
I can't tell whether
you're kidding.

54
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,290
I'm a woman of mystery.

55
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,393
You know, you might want to try
repeating some of those words in french.

56
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:57,122
No.

57
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,581
We leave for Paris
in two weeks.

58
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,320
Yes, but I don't have to
actually speak french.

59
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:01,773
I just have to sound french.

60
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:04,552
That way, if the parisians find
me just another uncouth american,

61
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:06,400
I can tell them my sad story.

62
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,592
"I was born in Marseille,

63
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:12,811
"and my parents were killed
in a très tragique accident.

64
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:15,523
"And so I was sent
to the states

65
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:17,943
"and adopted by
the evil Gilmores,

66
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:20,451
"who refused to let
me speak french,

67
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:24,782
"but I never forgot the
accent of my mother country."

68
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:26,441
That's a complicated backstory.

69
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:28,401
I've led a complicated life.

70
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:31,112
- Somebody gets a lot of mail.
- Yeah, well, I'm a popular gal.

71
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,111
Also, my system is,
I only open my mail once a month.

72
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:36,913
Your system is to open
your mail once a month?

73
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,191
12 times a year, you know,

74
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,501
because if you open your
mail more than that,

75
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:43,650
you get a lot of mattress fliers
and bills and another bill.

76
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,803
This  way,
I open it once a month,

77
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:48,093
and I get letters from people
who still write letters

78
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:51,213
and shampoo samples
and fun stuff.

79
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:52,880
It's fun.

80
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,441
Hey, what's this?

81
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:56,191
Something from Yale?

82
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,090
About the parents' weekend.
We should go.

83
00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:59,611
- Nah.
- Why no?

84
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:00,802
I'm sure it already happened.

85
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:03,020
No, it's happening this weekend.
Come on. Could be fun.

86
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,970
I got to wash my hair.

87
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:06,392
Why don't you want to go?

88
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:07,522
Because -- my hair.

89
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:10,400
Looks great when it's dirty. The oil
gives it a kinf of sheen and gloss.

90
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:12,613
Parents' weekend is for lame-o
parents whose kids hate them,

91
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,732
so they need a school-sanctioned
event so they all spend time together.

92
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:18,760
A professor of geology is giving
a tour of the Peabody Museum.

93
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:20,162
My kid likes me.

94
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,130
I can go to Yale
any time I want.

95
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:24,802
51 weekends of the year
is my parents' weekend.

96
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:27,973
"The gemstones of Yale."
How cool does that sound?

97
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:29,590
On a scale of 1 to 2?

98
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:33,281
Listen, parents' weekend is not an
accurate portrait of the school, anyway.

99
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:36,061
They make special food.
They gussy the place up.

100
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,901
They plant kids under
trees reading Tolstoy,

101
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,133
so it all looks very
collegiate and idyllic.

102
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,372
There's a brunch at
Branford with the provost.

103
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:44,973
You know,
I've always loved the word "provost."

104
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:46,983
Although I have no idea
who or what a provost is,

105
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:48,723
- it just sounds so...
- Idyllic and collegiate?

106
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,580
Yes, or something
from a deli counter.

107
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:52,331
"Extra provost on
that, please."

108
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:53,500
Do you really want to go?

109
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:55,222
It's parents' weekend,
we're Rory's parents,

110
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:57,630
and we're together,
and why not?

111
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:00,081
Come on, I'll help you shampoo
your hair the night before.

112
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,093
All right.

113
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:03,351
But I have to work on sunday,
so we'll have to go saturday,

114
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,793
and you'll have to give
me a nice head massage

115
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,072
- when you wash my hair.
- With shampoo samples.

116
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,213
- And blow it out.
- Done.

117
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,012
- And braid it.
- I'll french-braid it.

118
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:12,690
Ooh là là. Hello?

119
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,490
- Mom?
- Bonjour, Rory.

120
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:16,700
Well, if it isn't the
orphan from Marseille.

121
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,463
C'est moi. What are you doing?

122
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:20,042
- Heading to class.
- Class?

123
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:22,412
Yes, class, where they teach
you all the college learnin'.

124
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:25,540
You're a senior. I thought no
seniors went to class before noon.

125
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:27,022
Nerd alert! Nerd alert!

126
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:28,572
Says  the woman
saying "nerd alert!"

127
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:30,511
Hey, guess who's coming
to parents' weekend.

128
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:32,172
Bunch of lame parents
whose kids hate 'em.

129
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:34,360
- Yes, and your parents.
- No way!

130
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,120
I got to keep you on your toes.
When you think I'll zig, I'll zag.

131
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,491
Then, when you think I'm gonna zag,
I do zag,

132
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,761
just to mess you up for the next time,
when might zig.

133
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:42,891
Dad's making you zag?

134
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,490
He's  dying to meet the provost.

135
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,882
Well, who isn't?

136
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:47,912
It's your mom who's
all about the provost.

137
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:50,041
I just wanted to see you and,
you know, check it out.

138
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,720
And I wouldn't mind seeing
the gemstones of Yale.

139
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:54,160
- The huh?
- The gemstones. The Yale gemstones.

140
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:54,932
Oh, right.

141
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:56,663
So is it cool if we come?
It's only for saturday.

142
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:59,380
Yeah, it'd be great. I mean,
saturday's gonna be pretty busy for me

143
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,840
'cause we have to put out a parents'
weekend edition of the paper,

144
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:03,164
but I could
definitely do lunch.

145
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:04,824
- She can do lunch.
- All right, then we'll do lunch.

146
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,721
I'll have extra
provost with mine.

147
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,871
Hey, after lunch,
can we walk Hunky Dan?

148
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:09,872
You mean, Handsome Dan?

149
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:11,563
That's his official
mascot name.

150
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,561
"Hunky Dan" is what I call
him when we're alone.

151
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:14,580
Mom, I got to go.

152
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:16,361
You know who'd make a great mascot?
Paul Anka.

153
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:17,090
Mom--

154
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,213
I'm not sure he's the Ivy League type,
though. He might need more

155
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,120
of a hacky-sacking, poetry-reading,
tie-dyeing kind of place --

156
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,120
- Mom!
- Like Reed or Oberlin,

157
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:26,481
where the air is sweet with
the scent of patchouli.

158
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:28,760
Mom, I'm not missing the
beginning of this lecture.

159
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:31,150
Nerd alert!
Nerd alert! Nerd alert!

160
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,683
- What kind of sandwich is that, Luke?
- Ham and cheese.

161
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,300
- Is it stinky cheese?
- Cheddar.

162
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:39,031
Because you really don't want to pack
April a lunch with stinky cheese.

163
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:40,532
By lunchtime,
the whole bag will smell,

164
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,362
and people won't believe it when
she says it's just the cheese.

165
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,132
They'll think it's her.
They'll think she's stinky.

166
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:46,241
Eat your breakfast, Kirk.

167
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,751
- Muffin?
- Yes, muffin?

168
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,112
No, I'm offering.

169
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:51,001
- Is it bran?
- It's banana.

170
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:52,452
It could be banana-bran.

171
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:54,291
- It's just banana.
- Okay.

172
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,873
- Butter?
- Not too much.

173
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,153
- 1 1/2 pats.
- Two pats is too much.

174
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,182
- 1 1/2.
- April, your ride's here.

175
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,752
I'm coming!

176
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:04,210
- Got everything?
- Yeah.

177
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:05,271
- Protractor?
- I got it.

178
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:06,470
- Biology homework?
- Yep.

179
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:08,653
- Extra sweater?
- Green cardigan in my locker.

180
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:10,143
- Good, good.
- Bye, dad.

181
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:12,111
- Wait, what about your swimsuit?
- I got it.

182
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,751
You sure you don't need
a ride to swim practice?

183
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,801
Megan's mom is taking me.
I told you.

184
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:17,681
She's coming!
All right, so, look --

185
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:20,400
I'll pick you up at 5:00,
and I'll be there right after work.

186
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:21,753
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

187
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,811
All right, already!
She's standing right here! Go!

188
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:25,221
All right. Bye.

189
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:27,993
I should go, too.

190
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:29,521
Have a good day, baby.

191
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:30,541
You too.

192
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:32,683
- Bye, Luke.
- Bye, Lulu.

193
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:40,681
Could someone crack a window?
Because I am suffocating.

194
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:42,512
- What?
- Tell me you didn't see that.

195
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:43,613
See what, Kirk?

196
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,412
Lulu! She's smothering me!

197
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:46,643
Smothering you?

198
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,401
Everywhere I go, there she is.

199
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,250
I'm sitting at the movies.
Who's sitting next to me? Lulu.

200
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:54,230
I go out to dinner.
Who's sitting across from me? Lulu.

201
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:56,290
I'm hanging out on the couch,
watching TV.

202
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:57,741
Who's right there next to me?

203
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:59,522
- Your mother.
- And Lulu.

204
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:01,952
And at least mother
respects my personal space.

205
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,333
Sometimes when you're
watching "Antiques Roadshow,"

206
00:08:04,345 --> 00:08:07,552
you just don't want
somebody tickling your arm.

207
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,851
Bye again.

208
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:22,493
You're pitiful.

209
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:23,861
I'm just telling you how it is.

210
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:26,383
You don't tell me how it is.
I tell you how it is.

211
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:28,082
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

212
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,592
You think you do, but you don't.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

213
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,810
You're telling me that
you tell me how it is?

214
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:34,022
That's what I'm telling you.

215
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:36,043
- We'll just see about that. Lorelai?
- Busy.

216
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,072
- We have a question.
- Busy, busy bee.

217
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,151
Sookie's under the mistaken
impression that she will be

218
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,832
in charge of the front desk
while you are in Paris.

219
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:45,220
I informed her that
that job falls to me.

220
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:47,131
Could you please
clear this up for her?

221
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:50,312
Did I not mention how busy I am?
Busy, like a bee. Bzzz!

222
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:51,640
Lorelai!

223
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:55,233
Michel, while I am away,
you're in charge of the front desk.

224
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,582
However, Sookie is a
co-owner of the Inn,

225
00:08:57,597 --> 00:09:00,001
so she is in charge in charge.

226
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:03,013
That is preposterous.
She does not know the first thing

227
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,892
about running the front desk.

228
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:07,301
All I have to know is how
to tell your sorry behind

229
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:09,422
to stand at the front
desk and be courteous

230
00:09:09,436 --> 00:09:12,082
and to check those nice
people in and out.

231
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,572
- Sorry.
- Absurd.

232
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,852
That's right --
back to your station!

233
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,782
Really? Was that
really necessary?

234
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:20,031
- What?
- To provoke him like that.

235
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:21,451
You know how sensitive he is.

236
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,533
Well, I'm sorry.
He's been driving me crazy.

237
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,551
He keeps referring to
himself as my supervisor

238
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,400
and insisting that I
call him "captain."

239
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,193
Well now I have to deal all
day with sulky, pouty Michel.

240
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:31,383
He's a big baby.

241
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,670
He should come to work wearing
a diaper and carrying a rattle.

242
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,191
Maybe while I'm gone,
you can get him to do that.

243
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:38,770
Hello?

244
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:39,852
Oh, hi.

245
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:41,612
- Are you Sookie St. James?
- That's me.

246
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:43,951
I'm Harvey Tuttle.
I just took over the Tillman farm.

247
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:46,852
Oh, yeah. Congratulations.
Beautiful property.

248
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,323
Thank you. I still can't
quite believe it's all mine.

249
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,861
Anyhow, this is my first crop,

250
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,543
and I'm offering free samples
to all the local restaurants.

251
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:57,171
Got some eggplant, some zucchini,
some tomatoes here.

252
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:00,001
Oh, thank you, but I already 
have a vegetable supplier.

253
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,270
Well, you know, technically,
tomatoes are a fruit.

254
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,703
Ah. Fair point.

255
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,913
Well, I have a vegetable
and fruit supplier.

256
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:07,642
- How about legumes?
- And legumes.

257
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:10,020
That's okay. Why don't you go
ahead and take this batch anyway?

258
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,881
- Oh, no, no, no.
- On the house.

259
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:14,161
If you like it and feel like
passing my name along to someone,

260
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,742
I'd greatly appreciate it.

261
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:18,401
- Okay. I will do that.
- Thank you.

262
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,641
It was nice meeting
you, Sookie.

263
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:21,593
Nice to meet you, too.

264
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:27,701
Come on! Everybody should be 
in the locker room!

265
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:29,701
Allison, Haley, no running.

266
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:31,351
My towel's all wet.

267
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:33,342
That's what happens when you
throw it in the pool, Laura.

268
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,011
It's a terrific lesson
in cause and effect.

269
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:37,863
Now, squeeze it out
and go get changed.

270
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:40,760
Thank you.

271
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:45,001
- Hi, there.
- Hi. I'm Luke Danes.

272
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,871
April's dad.
She talks a lot about you.

273
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:48,300
Yeah, you must be
coach Bennett.

274
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,252
-  Susan.
- Yeah.

275
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:50,810
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. You too.

276
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:52,610
April's in the locker room.
She should be right out.

277
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:53,451
Okay.

278
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:54,811
She's doing really great --

279
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:56,952
definitely one of our most
enthusiastic swimmers.

280
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:58,490
Yeah, she really
seems to love it.

281
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,521
Good natural technique, too.
Does she get that from you?

282
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:03,392
Oh, no, not me.
No, I don't really know how to swim.

283
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:04,890
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

284
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:06,921
I mean, I could doggy-paddle
to shore in a pinch,

285
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:09,140
but I never really 
learned formally, you know.

286
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:10,431
Luke, that's not good.

287
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:11,673
I'm pretty good
on land, though.

288
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:13,100
You need to be certified.

289
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:15,703
You  take April to pools,
lakes, the ocean.

290
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:17,630
I never really
thought about that.

291
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:20,952
No worries. I teach an adult swim class
saturday mornings for 1 1/2 hour.

292
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:24,211
It's an 8-week course. And in fact,
I started new classes last week,

293
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,342
so if you came this saturday, you'll
really not have missed much at all.

294
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,170
Oh, I-I don't know.

295
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:31,462
Luke, this is not
something I would wait on.

296
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:34,572
Well, I -- Yeah, okay.
I guess I could do that.

297
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:35,532
Great.

298
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,670
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

299
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:39,050
Oh, this is coach Bennett.

300
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:40,101
Yeah, we were just meeting.

301
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:42,191
Well, did she tell you I'm gonna
swim the 100-meter butterfly

302
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:44,981
and the 4x100-meter freestyle
at our meet next week?

303
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,350
No, but that's great!

304
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,572
I mean, I'm not anchor or anything,
but I'm still pretty fast.

305
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,201
And getting faster
all the time.

306
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:53,221
And hey, your dad's gonna
take a swim class with me.

307
00:11:53,316 --> 00:11:55,140
Really? You are?

308
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:56,112
Well, yeah.

309
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,793
Do you even own a bathing suit?

310
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:01,883
Yeah, I do.
I mean, it's not a Speedo or anything.

311
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:06,491
That  is the funniest
thing I have ever --

312
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:08,701
can we call mom and
tell her from the car?

313
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,320
Yeah.

314
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:15,541
Grass is just not this green -- not
outside of "Pleasantville," it isn't.

315
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:16,961
So, what exactly
are you saying?

316
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:19,311
I'm suggesting they
brought in sod.

317
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:22,003
- You suspect sod.
- Yes, yes, or spray paint.

318
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:24,472
Maybe they spray-painted the grass
when they spray-painted these trees

319
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:28,021
'cause there's autumnal foliage
and then there's autumnal foliage.

320
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:29,513
It's over the top, people.

321
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:33,020
You're onto them. Hey, you think
Yale piped in this crisp fall smell?

322
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:36,561
Uh, yeah, because Yale is crafty,
Yale is smart.

323
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:38,183
Yale is Yale, after all.

324
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:40,703
Have fun, you two!
Go, Bulldogs!

325
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:41,590
Hello.

326
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:42,620
Hi!

327
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:43,882
Let me ask you something.

328
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:47,573
Do you really go here,
or are you an actress hired by Yale?

329
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:50,272
What? I go here. I go here.

330
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:51,673
You're good.
I almost believe you.

331
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,503
I'm sorry?

332
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,653
Hi. We're Rory
Gilmore's parents.

333
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:58,783
Well, Rory Gilmore's parents,
welcome to parents' weekend.

334
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:01,062
- Here's a parents' packet.
- Fabulous.

335
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:04,033
Inside, you should find a map
of the campus. You are here.

336
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:04,841
So we are.

337
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:07,500
A schedule of the weekend's
events and a nametag.

338
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:09,343
Thanks. Great.
Go, Bulldogs.

339
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,760
I was just gonna say that.
Have fun, you two.

340
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:12,910
- Okay.
- Thank you.

341
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,801
Hey, let's be
Laverne and Shirley.

342
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:15,732
What? No.

343
00:13:15,747 --> 00:13:17,690
Antony and Cleopatra?
F. Scott and Zelda?

344
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:18,930
Zinf and Del?

345
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:21,290
I think I'll stick
with my own name.

346
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:24,232
Pbht! Señor boring pants?
Mr. Stick-in-the-mud?

347
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:27,033
"A cappella," "a
cappella." Hmm-hmm.

348
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:29,240
There's a terrifying number of
a-cappella jams this weekend.

349
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,263
What exactly is an
a-cappella jam?

350
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,050
I don't know,
but it sure sounds painful.

351
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,391
Hey. We're here.

352
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:38,393
Hey. See if you can get that
editorial to fit on one page.

353
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:39,363
So, you're here.

354
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:41,062
With bells on,
and nothing else,

355
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:44,180
except leg warmers, roller skates,
and Groucho Marx glasses.

356
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:46,020
- How classy.
- Hi, Rory!

357
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:48,302
Well, we're your parents.
We're supposed to embarrass you.

358
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:49,413
Are you at the paper?

359
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,392
Yes, I am, indeed.
Where are you guys?

360
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:54,782
We are near a big brick
building and a big tree.

361
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:56,293
- Are you near there?
- Possibly.

362
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:58,620
We have a lot of brick buildings
and old trees here at Yale.

363
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:00,903
Tell her we're by the L-shaped
building that from the top

364
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,472
looks like a polaroid camera.

365
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:04,643
Believe it or not,
I don't know what Yale's buildings

366
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:05,711
look like from the sky.

367
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,231
How ignorant of you, honey.

368
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:10,061
Rory says she doesn't give two
figs about Yale architecture.

369
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:11,583
Not two figs?

370
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:13,022
1 1/2 figs is all I'll give.

371
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:14,173
So how are things at the paper?

372
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:16,471
Busy but good.
I should be done by lunch.

373
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,132
We got this schedule of events.
Any recommendations?

374
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:20,381
Brunch with the provost!

375
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:21,682
I might like to
tour the Peabody

376
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:23,781
or maybe catch one of
the faculty lectures --

377
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,280
There's one called "Plagues and
pleasures" with professor Summers.

378
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:29,363
Summers is good. He's a bigwig in
the world of molecular biophysics.

379
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:30,262
Sounds hard.

380
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:31,571
I doubt there'll be an exam.

381
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:34,661
How about "the extravagant
universe" with professor Quincy?

382
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:37,101
Hey, what is with
all the a cappella?

383
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:39,481
There's a cappella, a cappella,
morning, noon, and night.

384
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,191
I'm not sure I can take
that much a cappella.

385
00:14:41,226 --> 00:14:44,362
Then you should avoid arches. A-cappella
groups tend to hang out under arches.

386
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,582
Arches and any other places
with good acoustics.

387
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:47,552
Thanks for the tip.

388
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,881
If you hear a pitch pipe, run.
I got to get back to work.

389
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:51,912
Okay, we're gonna have
brunch with the provost...

390
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:54,021
or on the provost --
it's still unclear.

391
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:55,983
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

392
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,220
Hey.

393
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:58,960
What is with your nametag?

394
00:14:58,975 --> 00:14:59,740
What do you mean?

395
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:01,123
It's in the middle
of your chest.

396
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:01,813
So?

397
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:03,882
So, you're supposed to
wear it off to the side.

398
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:05,343
Who wears a nametag in
the middle of their chest?

399
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:06,770
- Superman.
- Superman's "S"?

400
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:08,202
That was not a nametag.
That was an emblem.

401
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:09,733
So, this is my emblem.

402
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:12,570
"Hello, I'm Rory Gilmore's dad,
Christopher" is your emblem?

403
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:14,181
Yes.
Yes, it is.

404
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:16,792
I'm gonna have to ask you to
walk 15 feet in front of me.

405
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:21,530
And breathe in. And blow.

406
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:26,511
And breathe in. And blow.

407
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:28,133
Good, Luke.

408
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:29,892
But try not to take
such shallow breaths.

409
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:33,401
Try to take slower,
deeper breaths from your diaphragm.

410
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,412
- Feel that?
- Yeah.

411
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:38,210
I'm having a little trouble
getting deep breaths over here.

412
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:40,072
You're doing fine, Ronald.

413
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:42,791
Now you stopped
breathing altogether.

414
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:45,141
- Just try and relax.
- Okay.

415
00:15:45,308 --> 00:15:48,061
It's okay.
You'll get the hang of it.

416
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,893
All right, everybody.
That's it. Good work.

417
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:52,782
You did good today.

418
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:54,182
- Yeah? Thanks.
- Yeah.

419
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:55,932
You caught right up.

420
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:58,002
I'll have you swimming
like a fish in no time.

421
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,253
Oh, good. Thank you.

422
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,361
So... you eat?

423
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,891
- Eat?
- Food.

424
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:05,310
I was thinking you could call me,
and we could get a bite to eat.

425
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:07,153
Uh, yeah, sure, sure.

426
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:09,640
Here. Here's the Young
Dolphins' contact sheet.

427
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:11,111
My number's right at the top.

428
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:13,322
Okay. Great. Thanks.

429
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:15,222
- See you soon.
- Bye.

430
00:16:16,297 --> 00:16:18,132
Look at this propaganda.

431
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:20,262
Belgian waffles, cloth napkins.

432
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:21,663
I've had breakfast here before,

433
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:24,591
and it was paper napkins and
american cereal all the way.

434
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,993
Yeah --
lox, capers, itty-bitty bagels?

435
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:28,330
Pack of lies.

436
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:29,173
Coffee?

437
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:30,760
Uh, coffee.

438
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:31,650
Coffee.

439
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,130
I'm Lou, Ethan Morton's dad.

440
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:33,902
Cheers.

441
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:36,763
I'm Christopher. This is Lorelai.
We're Rory Gilmore's parents.

442
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:39,223
Rory Gilmore? Sure.
She's a senior, right?

443
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:41,832
Wow. Did you memorize
the student facebook?

444
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,711
The masthead of the
Yale Daily News.

445
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:46,990
Ethan's an aspiring journalist
and a big fan of your daughter's.

446
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,840
I love that Rory has fans.

447
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:51,662
Maybe we should set up a lunch or
something so Rory could meet Ethan.

448
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,490
Lou, honestly.

449
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:55,361
I apologize on behalf
of my husband,

450
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:58,310
who can't seem to remember that
Ethan already got into Yale.

451
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:01,280
The pressure's off. He doesn't
need his booster club anymore.

452
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,102
Daisy.

453
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:04,821
Hi. Lorelai and Christopher.
We're Rory Gilmore's parents.

454
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:07,510
Oh, Rory Gilmore's parents.

455
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,472
Oh! Where did you get the
darling little bagels?

456
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,222
Oh, they're right over here.
I'll show you.

457
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:14,302
You know, Ethan really is an
incredible journalist.

458
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:16,542
He wrote this editorial
for his high-school paper

459
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:19,361
arguing that it should be legal
to burn the american flag.

460
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:20,610
Insightful as hell.

461
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,612
I'd be glad to e-mail you a copy,
if you want.

462
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:23,952
Where is the provost?

463
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,711
Aren't you dying to
meet the provost?

464
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:27,070
Sorry if I was
being a bit pushy.

465
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:28,803
No. Please. You're a proud dad.

466
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:30,650
Yeah. And we should
be proud, right?

467
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:32,822
- Our kids done good.
- Yeah.

468
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:35,552
It's just hard to let go,
you know, after all those years

469
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,983
of looking over their homework
and reading their papers,

470
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:40,160
practicing lines with
them for the school play,

471
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,931
taking them to karate lessons,
violin lessons,

472
00:17:42,947 --> 00:17:44,593
S.A.T.-prep courses.

473
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:46,322
What about 5:00 a.m.
hockey practice?

474
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:47,681
Science projects.

475
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:50,161
I helped Owen build a
wave generator one year.

476
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:51,340
$3,200.

477
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:53,110
That's what it cost me to
replace the kitchen tiles

478
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:55,230
when the thing exploded in
the middle of the night.

479
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:57,593
- It exploded?
- I sell ladies' shoes.

480
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,822
What do I know about
wave generators?

481
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:01,263
Jake -- Owen Huber's dad.

482
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:03,291
- I'm Christopher. I'm...
- Rory Gilmore's dad.

483
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:05,212
I was just talking
to your wife.

484
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:07,210
Um, actually, I'm not his wife.

485
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:09,850
I didn't say that you were. I was
talking about his wife -- Mrs. Gilmore.

486
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:12,081
She's over there
by the mimosas.

487
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,690
Unbelievable.

488
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:17,703
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

489
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:20,011
I'm gonna go talk
to Mrs. Gilmore.

490
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:21,943
Which lectures are
you guys gonna hit?

491
00:18:21,957 --> 00:18:24,743
And I said to him,
"they've tenured Bill Sunderland?

492
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:27,003
Who's next -- Carmen Electra?"

493
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:29,402
Good one, mom.

494
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,103
Lorelai. If you'll excuse us?

495
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:33,353
- Lorelai.
- Hi.

496
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:35,550
Well. My goodness.
What on earth are you doing here?

497
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:38,442
What am I doing here? I think the
question is, what are you doing here?

498
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:39,952
It's Yale parents' weekend.

499
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:41,550
Yes, but you are not a parent.

500
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:42,743
I still can't
believe you're here.

501
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:44,912
Mother, it's parents' weekend.
I'm a parent.

502
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:46,683
That's why I'm here.
I'm a parent.

503
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:47,760
And I'm a grandparent.

504
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,221
Right. A grandparent,
not a parent.

505
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:51,332
- A grandparent is a type of parent.
- No, it's not.

506
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,440
A grand piano is a type of piano,
is it not?

507
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:56,423
Well, you got me there, Riddler,
but I hope that logic works

508
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,242
when I crash
grandparents' weekend.

509
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:00,753
Oh, please, Lorelai.
Your father and I have been attending

510
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,653
Rory's parents' weekends here at
Yale since her freshman year.

511
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,051
It's one of our
little traditions.

512
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:07,620
Hello, Rachel.
I'll see you at the field-hockey game?

513
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:11,103
It's one of your little traditions
to pretend to be Rory's parents?

514
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:12,673
Lorelai. What a surprise.

515
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:15,313
Yes, it is a surprise. You know why?
'Cause you guys aren't parents.

516
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:17,740
- Why are you here?
- I'm an alumnus, Lorelai.

517
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,430
Also a visiting faculty member.

518
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:21,050
And you'll remember,
until recently,

519
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:24,460
your father and I were the ones taking
responsibility for Rory's tuition.

520
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:25,701
Yes, I remember.

521
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,003
We felt someone ought to attend,
for Rory's sake.

522
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:29,563
It's obviously not
your kind of thing.

523
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:31,293
What is that supposed to mean?

524
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:33,530
Well, I'm glad you're here.

525
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,363
Thank you. Me too.
What's that supposed to mean?

526
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:38,871
You don't like these kinds of things --
things with schedules and nametags.

527
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,371
You mock these kinds of things.

528
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,431
Well, I'm here.
I'm not mocking. I'm brunching.

529
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:44,253
I think you'll find
parents' weekend great fun.

530
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:46,933
Thank you. It is. I am --
finding it great fun.

531
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:49,442
We always tour the campus,
check in here at Branford,

532
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,422
maybe take in a
faculty lecture or two,

533
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:52,842
and then take Rory
out to dinner.

534
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:54,372
You're taking Rory to dinner?

535
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:56,850
We're going to chez
Zinjustin this year,

536
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,701
a fabulous french restaurant.

537
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:01,112
They have a crème brûlée
that is to die for.

538
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:02,150
Well, that sounds like fun.

539
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:05,102
Too bad you're gonna miss the
tour of the gemstones of Yale.

540
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,283
The tour at Peabody?
I thought that was much earlier.

541
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:09,803
Yes, well, it is --
for the general public.

542
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:11,503
We signed up for a
special evening one.

543
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:13,450
Chris and I signed
up weeks ago.

544
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:14,441
Christopher's here?

545
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:16,892
Yes, 'cause he's a parent.
It's his weekend, too.

546
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:18,502
So, we'll go to the tour

547
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:21,692
and then probably hit a few panels,
go to the --

548
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:24,392
What is this you have on
your nametag -- "Zinf"?

549
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:25,810
What is "Zinf"?
Some kind of joke?

550
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:28,972
Oh, it's an old,
traditional Yale word... thingy.

551
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:31,750
What is that word --
"Zinf"? Is it hebrew?

552
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,041
Why is it on your nametag?

553
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:35,140
You guys don't know?
I thought you were all into Yale.

554
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:36,433
Hello, Emily. Richard.

555
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:37,853
Christopher. Nice to see you.

556
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:40,503
Hey, Lor, professor Quincy's
talk is about to start,

557
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:41,743
and I know you
probably don't --

558
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:45,120
Don't want to miss a word.
Yes, that's true.

559
00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:48,250
Well, we've got to go.
You enjoy your evening.

560
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:51,381
Astrophysics waits for no man.

561
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:58,030
When supernovae explode,
they emit an energy

562
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:01,311
that is 4 billion times
greater than the sun.

563
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,570
So powerful are these
explosions that even though

564
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:06,600
they're occurring halfway
across the observable universe,

565
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:09,142
some 7 billion
light-years away...

566
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:10,641
My parents have got a lot of nerve,
you know?

567
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:12,911
That's one thing they've got,
is nerve.

568
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:14,660
They should put
it to good use --

569
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:17,150
start a knife-throwing
contest or something.

570
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:18,311
Lor...

571
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:20,142
I mean, lunch? Please.

572
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:21,433
They get dinner,
and we get lunch?

573
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,552
Lunch is such a booby prize.

574
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:25,103
...we would be able to see

575
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:28,293
that the expansion of the
universe was slowing down.

576
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:31,501
I just can't believe Rory didn't tell
us that they were coming, you know.

577
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:36,693
Berate her. "Rory...
you... little... rat."

578
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:40,131
But we've learned that the expansion
of the universe is not slowing down --

579
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:41,812
It's speeding up.

580
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:45,410
She says that she assumed that
we knew they were coming.

581
00:21:45,425 --> 00:21:48,583
"When you assume,
you make an --"

582
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,133
Shh!

583
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:53,380
Something else is
happening in the universe

584
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,011
that is counteracting the
powerful force of gravity,

585
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:58,392
and that's what we
call "dark energy."

586
00:21:58,406 --> 00:22:02,040
Hey, you know what?
We should have lunch at chez Zinjustin.

587
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,991
I hear they have a
crème brûlée to die for.

588
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:06,093
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.

589
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:08,960
You can't make a
phone call in here.

590
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:10,912
I want to make sure
we get a reservation.

591
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:12,170
...back in the 1930s.

592
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:14,673
So, it may be that Einstein
was right all along.

593
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:18,270
Turns out the guy
was pretty smart.

594
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:24,162
All right,
are there any questions?

595
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,021
Yes?

596
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:26,720
Yeah, how can we tell
whether dark energy

597
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:29,310
is the same thing as the
cosmological constant?

598
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:30,943
Excellent question.

599
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:34,253
More thorough measurement from
observatories on the ground,

600
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:36,850
from the Hbble
Space Telescope...

601
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,631
I was making
ratatouille anyway.

602
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:44,080
Excuse me?

603
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:47,691
Perfectly good vegetables,
and I was making ratatouille anyway,

604
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:49,922
and no sense in wasting them.

605
00:22:49,938 --> 00:22:51,732
Did I miss something?

606
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:55,192
Not like there's anything
to feel guilty about.

607
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,420
Jackson sells his
vegetables all over town.

608
00:22:57,436 --> 00:22:59,732
I'm not just gonna
throw these away.

609
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,633
Just because Lorelai is away
does not mean that I'm obligated

610
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,061
to listen to your
incessant prattling.

611
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:07,591
I mean,
it would be wrong to waste vegetables.

612
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:09,753
Wasting vegetables is wrong.

613
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:11,863
I will listen to you
on one condition.

614
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:13,392
Call me "captain."

615
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,322
- No.
- Fine.

616
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:18,981
Okay... captain.

617
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:22,112
Yes?

618
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:25,441
The point is that Jackson's
vegetables are top-of-the-line,

619
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:26,522
first-rate.

620
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:30,563
But they're his vegetables,
you know, and these aren't.

621
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,323
These have something
different to offer,

622
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:34,883
and I shouldn't feel
guilty about --

623
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:38,262
You know what?
It's not worth it.

624
00:23:41,397 --> 00:23:43,451
It's just ratatouille, okay?

625
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:45,653
Nothing to get all
riled up about.

626
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,543
Caesar, I'm back.

627
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,943
Hey, Luke, you want 
to grab a cold one tonight,

628
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,050
- bird-dog some chicas?
- What?

629
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:57,251
As of 0700 this evening,
I'm going to be a free man.

630
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:58,940
- You are?
- I am.

631
00:23:58,957 --> 00:24:02,963
Giving Lulu the old heave-ho,
hitting the eject button.

632
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:04,072
Kirk?

633
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:05,543
I owe it all to you, buddy.

634
00:24:05,556 --> 00:24:06,400
Me?

635
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:07,792
You inspired me.

636
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:10,621
I look at you, and I think,
"this guy's doing it right.

637
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:12,610
Slave to no master."

638
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:15,502
You come home at 3:00 in the morning --
no one cares.

639
00:24:15,516 --> 00:24:18,280
You want to eat dessert for dinner --
no one cares.

640
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:20,752
You walk around in tube
socks and tighty whities --

641
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:22,181
no one cares.

642
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:25,650
No one cares what you
do or where you go.

643
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:28,040
So, what do you say, Luke?

644
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:30,143
You want to be my wingman,

645
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:31,943
Goose to my Maverick?

646
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:35,603
# You never close your eyes anymore #

647
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:38,313
# When I kiss your lips #

648
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:40,321
# And there's no tenderness -- #

649
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:41,992
Listen, you pinhead,

650
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:44,582
you should be kissing the
ground that Lulu walks on.

651
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:47,730
Why that sweet girl lets you
within a hundred miles of her

652
00:24:47,745 --> 00:24:49,940
is beyond me, but she does.

653
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:53,131
You are the luckiest man on the
planet to have a girl like that

654
00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:55,290
looking out for you
and caring about you.

655
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:57,812
And if you say so much as
one unkind word to her,

656
00:24:57,828 --> 00:25:00,970
I will personally break
every bone in your body.

657
00:25:00,985 --> 00:25:02,713
You got me?

658
00:25:11,737 --> 00:25:13,473
So, what did you end up
putting on the front page?

659
00:25:13,506 --> 00:25:14,663
Don't play dumb, Paris.

660
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:17,161
My early-admission/early-actions piece.
No kidding.

661
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:18,802
It was a good article.

662
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,060
I'm hardly ever here anymore,
I'm putting in minimal effort

663
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:23,762
when I am here, and yet my article
is still the front-page lead.

664
00:25:23,777 --> 00:25:24,801
It's almost too easy.

665
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:26,501
It's not locked yet, Paris.

666
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:28,813
Okay, A.K., you're gonna take
care of that Lacrosse caption?

667
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:29,992
What was wrong with what I had?

668
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:32,712
Well, you might save the metaphors
and alliterations for poetry class

669
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:34,121
and give me something
short and snappy.

670
00:25:34,155 --> 00:25:35,783
And you might want
to mention Lacrosse.

671
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:36,603
You got it.

672
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:39,340
- I love how bossy she is.
- Well, she is their boss.

673
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:40,700
Yeah, I love that.

674
00:25:40,717 --> 00:25:42,832
She's like a dictator,
only cute and nonviolent.

675
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:44,841
And instead of a country,
she has a newspaper.

676
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:47,380
"Yale Lacrosse team sticks
it to Ivy League rivals"?

677
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:49,761
Done. Okay, so, A.K.
will take care of that.

678
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:52,251
And good job, everybody.
Layout is locked.

679
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:55,192
It's funny. It's almost like I'd have
to work harder not to get the front page.

680
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:56,712
Oh, hi, parents.

681
00:25:56,728 --> 00:25:59,292
You are the cutest
fascist ever.

682
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,012
So, how was the morning?

683
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:03,903
Brunch was lovely, except of course
for my parents skulking around,

684
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:06,321
which no one warned me about.
Hey, I forgot -- I'm still mad at you.

685
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:07,442
Don't be mad at me.

686
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:09,650
All right, fine. But only 'cause
you're the cutest despot ever.

687
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:10,451
What else?

688
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,960
We had a few close
brushes with a cappella.

689
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:14,181
That was a narrow escape.

690
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:16,221
We were taking a shortcut on
the way to the lecture hall,

691
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:17,720
and we almost
shortcutted our way

692
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:20,532
into a group of guys wearing
tuxedos singing "zombie jamboree."

693
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,691
You guys went to a lecture?

694
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:24,502
Yes, where I learned that
the universe is expanding

695
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,961
and that your dad is a
big question-asking geek.

696
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:30,382
Hey, we have come to take you
to lunch at chez Zinjustin.

697
00:26:30,397 --> 00:26:31,653
Wow. Fancy.

698
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:33,733
Apparently, the crème
brûlée is to die for.

699
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:35,262
Since when do you
say "to die for"?

700
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:36,772
Since he got addicted
to "Project Runway."

701
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:37,920
Make it work.

702
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:39,333
You guys should meet everybody.

703
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:43,513
Mom and dad, this is Sheila,
Bill, A.K., Raj, and Joni.

704
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,451
- This is Christopher and Lorelai.
- Hello!

705
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,883
And you know Paris, of course.

706
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:48,160
Lorelai. It's been too long.

707
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:49,972
Hi. Oh. Wow. Okay.

708
00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:51,230
And you know Christopher.

709
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:53,341
I believe we've met in passing.
Good to see you, Chris.

710
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:54,663
Good to see you.

711
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:57,653
We're just going to chez
Zinjustin for lunch.

712
00:26:57,668 --> 00:26:59,152
You mean "Chez fancy pants."

713
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,990
My dad took me and my roommates
there for dinner freshman year --

714
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:04,431
back when he still loved me.
It's supernice.

715
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:06,522
I hear they match your napkin
to what you're wearing.

716
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:09,253
I hear they fold your
napkin into an origami swan

717
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:10,542
every time you leave the table.

718
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:13,360
I don't know for the napkins, but I
hear the crème brûlée is to die for.

719
00:27:13,395 --> 00:27:15,643
- I heard that, too.
- You know what? You should all come along.

720
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:16,982
- Who? Us?
- Sure.

721
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:19,062
- Hey, let's bring the whole gang.
- Oh, dad, you don't have to --

722
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,221
I want to. It'll give me a chance
to get to know your friends.

723
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:22,822
- People might have plans.
- None.

724
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:24,621
- There's a shocker.
- I'm starving.

725
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:27,840
Well, all right, then.
Come on. Lunch on Rory's dad.

726
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:30,043
- Thank you.
- Cool.

727
00:27:37,817 --> 00:27:40,351
Ah, thank you.
The wine is wonderful.

728
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:42,483
I'm so glad you're enjoying it.

729
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:45,040
Hey, this is a french restaurant.
Shouldn't all the servers be french?

730
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:48,163
Je ne suis pas français, mais je peux
parler français, si vous préférez.

731
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:51,582
Uh, where is the
nearest subway station?

732
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,162
- Another bottle, sir?
- Absolutely.

733
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:58,192
Anyway, the chalet in Killington
had this open floor plan,

734
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,323
sort of the way Rory's
apartment's laid out.

735
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:02,412
I've never exactly
seen Rory's apartment.

736
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:03,321
Oh yeah?

737
00:28:03,335 --> 00:28:06,352
We mostly just hang at the paper and --
mostly at the paper.

738
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:09,203
Anyway, I really want to rent a
place at a ski resort this winter,

739
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:11,453
maybe Killington or Sugarloaf.

740
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:12,533
That sounds great.

741
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:14,530
You know, you should come --
totally.

742
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:17,032
We'll get all of Rory's friends
together for a long weekend,

743
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:18,891
ski, hang out.
It'b be a blast.

744
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:20,360
A ski trip sounds awesome.

745
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:21,222
Who's going skiing?

746
00:28:21,238 --> 00:28:23,472
You are -- this winter.
Everyone's invited.

747
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:24,491
Right on.

748
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:26,823
You don't hang out with any of these
people outside the paper, do you?

749
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:28,181
Not so much.

750
00:28:28,195 --> 00:28:30,763
Okay. Who wants dessert?

751
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:33,222
I'd love a crème brûlée.
I've never had crème brûlée.

752
00:28:33,236 --> 00:28:34,481
I could do with a cognac.

753
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:36,000
I wouldn't say no
to a digestif.

754
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:38,330
Crème brûlée for me.
And a cognac.

755
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:41,342
You know, I think we'd like to get
crème brûlée and cognac all around.

756
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,933
- Sorry.
- Why sorry?

757
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:44,893
- Sorry if this lunch is weird.
- No.

758
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:47,522
- Rory...
- Okay, this lunch is weird.

759
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:50,342
I feel like we're those
lame-o parents of yore.

760
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:51,872
Dad is trying kind of hard.

761
00:28:51,888 --> 00:28:54,253
Yeah. Any minute,
he's gonna start juggling plates.

762
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:55,722
And hanging spoons
off his nose.

763
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:57,241
Yeah, but it's sweet.

764
00:28:57,257 --> 00:28:59,051
Seriously, whenever you
guys get a 3-day weekend,

765
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:01,142
- you should totally come up.
- Can we rent skis there?

766
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:02,842
Sure, or I can lend you a pair.

767
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:05,902
We'll have you jumping moguls down
a black diamond in no time, Raj.

768
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:08,762
I guess it's good that I experience
a little bit of lame-o parenting.

769
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:12,433
I mean, It's part of the quintessential
college experience, isn't it?

770
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:13,243
I guess.

771
00:29:13,257 --> 00:29:15,112
And it's great that you
got to meet the whole gang

772
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:18,063
before our big ski
vacation together.

773
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:21,302
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh" good or "uh-oh" bad?

774
00:29:21,318 --> 00:29:23,192
I guess there isn't really
an "uh-oh" good, is there?

775
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:26,482
Listen up, guys. A bunch of students
that were protesting the war

776
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,302
took over president
Stewart's office.

777
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:30,160
It's look like we're gonna have
to rework the whole edition.

778
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:31,613
Why can't the news stop
while we're eating?

779
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,343
- I know, it's so impolite.
- I just got a text with a photo.

780
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,572
Looks like they're wearing
George Bush masks and...

781
00:29:38,107 --> 00:29:40,133
Are those Condoleezza
Rice masks?

782
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,340
They make Condoleezza masks?

783
00:29:41,357 --> 00:29:42,742
We've got to get on
this, everybody.

784
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:44,483
Um, so you guys, I'm sorry,
look like we've...

785
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:45,862
- It's okay, go.
- Duty calls.

786
00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:48,161
Okay, Sheila,
get Keith on the phone

787
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:50,492
and see if you can get him down there.
Actually, get Samantha down there, too.

788
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:52,820
I want so many photos of this thing,
I can make a flip book.

789
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:56,260
Bill and A.K., get back to the office so 
you can proof the stories or emailing it in.

790
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:57,332
Everyone else, you're with me.

791
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:59,251
- What about the crème brûlée?
- And our cognac?

792
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:01,610
I have yet to taste the
sweet nectar of crème brûlée.

793
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,882
This is going to
be our front page.

794
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,231
Front page? Really?

795
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:05,643
I think the front page
is fine as it is.

796
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:06,273
Paris...

797
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:08,733
Come on. We all know these
rabble-rousers are just looking
for attention.

798
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:10,183
- Why indulge them ?
- Let's go.

799
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:12,903
I want to go.
I want to report this story.

800
00:30:12,915 --> 00:30:15,293
I just want to do it after
I eat my crème brûlée.

801
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:16,991
I mean, what if tonight 
I get hit by lightning

802
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:19,313
and die a crème-Brûlée virgin?

803
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:21,041
A crème-Brûlée virgin?

804
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:23,650
You know what? Enough.
This is a major political protest.

805
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:26,042
It's a big story,
and it's going to go on our front page.

806
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,542
Now get your drunk, crème-brûlée-craving
asses out of these chairs,

807
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,131
and let's get to work, okay?

808
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:32,223
Besides the lead,
I'm going to need some color --

809
00:30:32,235 --> 00:30:33,770
what's going on behind the masks,
that kind of things.

810
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:35,040
Joni, you want to
take a crack at that?

811
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:36,300
I'm a little tipsy.

812
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:38,281
Okay, is there anyone
who's not a little tipsy?

813
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:39,863
Thanks for lunch, dad.

814
00:30:39,877 --> 00:30:41,262
- Thank you.
- Lunch was great.

815
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,383
- Great meeting you.
- See you later.

816
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:49,243
Well, I hope you're hungry
for some crème brûlée.

817
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:52,903
Are you sure you want to
fianchetto that bishop so early?

818
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,922
I don't know,
it depends on what "fianchetto" means.

819
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:57,333
It means I'm gonna kick your
butt if you make that move.

820
00:30:57,348 --> 00:30:58,993
Well, you're kicking my butt anyway,
so I don't see

821
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,800
how one fianchetto is gonna
make much of a difference.

822
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:03,800
Besides, it sounds fancy and make me seem like
I know what I'm doing.

823
00:31:03,815 --> 00:31:05,521
You're not very good.

824
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:06,880
April.

825
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:08,573
Sorry. I can be blunt.

826
00:31:08,587 --> 00:31:09,740
Tell it like it is, sister.

827
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:11,762
Besides, later tonight,
when we Boggle,

828
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:14,042
which is what I was told
we'd be playing tonight,

829
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:16,730
it is your butt that is going to be
kicked, because I've been studying

830
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:19,400
my 7-letter words that
sound made-up but aren't.

831
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:22,173
"Palfrey" -- P-A-L-F-R-E-Y.

832
00:31:22,187 --> 00:31:23,431
It's a saddle
horse for a woman.

833
00:31:23,468 --> 00:31:24,132
Impressive.

834
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:27,023
Okay, so,
coach Bennett and I are gonna go out

835
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:30,111
and have some dinner together and talk,
and then I'll be home.

836
00:31:30,128 --> 00:31:31,480
Shouldn't be more
than a couple hours.

837
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,671
Just a dinner and some talking.

838
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,301
It would be weird if it was
a dinner with no talking.

839
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:37,061
Sure.

840
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:40,203
And you should probably call her "Susan"
tonight, instead of "coach Bennett" --

841
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:41,960
- I think she'd prefer that.
- Good tip.

842
00:31:41,978 --> 00:31:43,131
We'll hang out
until you get back.

843
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,641
Okay, you got the number
of the restaurant.

844
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:47,813
I'm gonna have my cellphone on me,
so if there are any problems --

845
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:49,633
Thank you, Luke. Bye.

846
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:51,230
- Bye, dad.
- See you later.

847
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,640
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

848
00:31:56,657 --> 00:31:58,733
Okay, now,
it's your move, darlin',

849
00:31:58,748 --> 00:32:02,733
unless you'd rather discuss zymurgy --
Z-Y-M-U-R-G-Y --

850
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:05,312
the branch of applied chemistry
dealing with fermentation.

851
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:07,553
All right, all right.
We can play Boggle.

852
00:32:07,565 --> 00:32:09,010
Yes!

853
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:13,813
Hello. Two?

854
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:15,552
Okay, right this way.

855
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,420
There you go.

856
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:24,402
Your waitress will
be right with you.

857
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:26,930
Thank you.
Oh, no. Come sit with me.

858
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:29,280
- There?
- Yeah. It's cozier.

859
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,243
Oh. Okay.

860
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:32,610
I hate being so far away.

861
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:39,211
- Wow!
- I know, right?

862
00:32:39,228 --> 00:32:41,073
It's my favorite restaurant.

863
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:42,731
And you said you liked 
to eat healthy, so --

864
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:44,463
Yeah. Huh.
I've never eaten this healthy.

865
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:46,841
So, "vegan" doesn't
just mean "vegetarian."

866
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:49,221
No --
no animal products of any kind.

867
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:51,240
No eggs, no milk, no cheese.

868
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:52,320
Just soy everything.

869
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:54,203
Soy steak is scrumptious.

870
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:55,842
I swear you totally can't
tell the difference.

871
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,350
Oh, I bet I can.

872
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,712
So, Luke,
let me ask you a question.

873
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:00,851
Okay.

874
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:05,653
Who would play you in
the Luke Danes movie?

875
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:07,731
- Huh?
- Alive or dead.

876
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:10,630
Uh... I never really
thought about that.

877
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:12,070
Take your time.
Do you want to know mine?

878
00:33:12,105 --> 00:33:13,401
Sure.

879
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,343
Marlene Dietrich. Right?

880
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:18,411
- I don't know who that is.
- Sure you do.

881
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:19,720
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

882
00:33:19,738 --> 00:33:20,743
- Think.
- I don't.

883
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:23,591
"Touch of evil," "The
lady is willing,"

884
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:24,943
"Destry rides again."

885
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:29,553
"Your husband would rather be
cheated by me than married to you."

886
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:30,912
Oh, yeah, sure.

887
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,092
My last boyfriend --
"the ex" --

888
00:33:33,106 --> 00:33:35,342
He was always
calling me "Marlene!"

889
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:37,421
Oh, you know what?
I think you might know him.

890
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:38,951
Bob McCullough, Laura's father?

891
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:40,932
No, I don't think I do.

892
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:43,813
We lived together
for four months,

893
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:47,453
and then he just
went totally psycho.

894
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:49,050
- Psycho!
- ...egg corns.

895
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:51,643
I swore I wasn't gonna date any
more single dads after that,

896
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:54,183
but here I am.

897
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:56,791
You hooked me.

898
00:33:56,808 --> 00:34:00,692
Well, you know what they say --
third time's a charm.

899
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,943
Can I get anybody a drink?

900
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:03,383
Yes, please.

901
00:34:03,395 --> 00:34:05,881
I heard a bone crack,
several bones cracking.

902
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:07,543
Crack, crack, crack --
it was like fireworks.

903
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,491
Rugby is a violent sport.

904
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,881
I guess the fact that an ambulance
was parked by the side of the field

905
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,001
before the game even started
should've been my first clue.

906
00:34:14,038 --> 00:34:17,213
They don't park ambulances
next to tetherball matches.

907
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:19,332
I can't believe we lost.
It was so violent.

908
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,261
I guess they were
just violenter.

909
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:23,040
Uh, it's Rory.

910
00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:24,713
They're at the paper.
They're still working.

911
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:25,641
Man!

912
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:28,201
Half of them are
drunk or hung over.

913
00:34:28,215 --> 00:34:29,333
Joni passed out.

914
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:30,352
Oh, jeez.

915
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:31,870
Looks like she's gonna
be there all night.

916
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:33,432
Oh, that's not good news.

917
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:35,441
Well, silver lining --

918
00:34:35,455 --> 00:34:38,081
that means she won't get to
have dinner with my parents.

919
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:41,403
We got the only meal.
We won parents' weekend,

920
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:42,902
and we didn't even
break any bones.

921
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,670
Yeah. Some meal.

922
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:45,912
What's wrong?

923
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:49,401
Nothing. I just --
I... I screwed up.

924
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:50,521
What do you mean,
you screwed up?

925
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:53,020
It's my fault that Rory's
got to work all night.

926
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:55,612
What do you mean?
You staged the student protest?

927
00:34:55,628 --> 00:34:58,970
You wore a condi mask and manacled
yourself to the president's door?

928
00:34:58,986 --> 00:35:00,933
The big meal,
ordering all that wine.

929
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:02,630
Her staff's a mess.
It's my fault.

930
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:04,223
Honey, if those kids are
gonna be journalists,

931
00:35:04,258 --> 00:35:05,650
they have to learn
to write drunk.

932
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,790
I'm trying to be
superdad or something.

933
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,411
- Why?
- I don't know.

934
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:12,241
Does it have to do with the nametag-
in-the-middle-of-the-chest thing?

935
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:15,260
At the brunch, all the other
dads were talking about how

936
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,992
they took their kids to hockey
practice and violin lessons

937
00:35:19,006 --> 00:35:20,832
and helped them study
for the S.A.T.s,

938
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:23,313
and I just stood there like a jerk,
nodding my head

939
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:24,771
like I'd done all those things.

940
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:25,771
Oh, honey.

941
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:27,481
I didn't do any
of those things.

942
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:30,710
First of all, Rory didn't need
someone to check her homework.

943
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:32,080
She was a self-starter.

944
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:33,800
Second of all,
she wasn't interested in hockey.

945
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:36,543
And third of all,
you don't have to try to be superdad.

946
00:35:36,558 --> 00:35:37,750
I feel like I should be.

947
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,250
No. You can just relax,
you know?

948
00:35:40,267 --> 00:35:42,411
Be yourself.
Be the dad that you are --

949
00:35:42,428 --> 00:35:44,870
Clark Kent dad,
Christopher Hayden dad.

950
00:35:44,887 --> 00:35:46,131
I guess.

951
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,901
Totally.

952
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:50,222
It's just -- it's too late.

953
00:35:50,236 --> 00:35:52,950
I mean, I've got G.G.,
and that's great, but Rory --

954
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:54,962
Rory's grown up. I missed it.

955
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:56,043
You didn't miss it.

956
00:35:56,055 --> 00:35:57,561
She's a senior in college, Lor.

957
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,561
We have years of hard
parenting ahead.

958
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:01,933
She is due for a
quarter-life crisis.

959
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:04,083
All those years of
stability do not bode well.

960
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:05,230
We're gonna have plenty to do.

961
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:06,790
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

962
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:08,731
And the best part is...

963
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:10,610
we get to deal
with it together.

964
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,690
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

965
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:14,961
Quarter-life crisis, huh?

966
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,071
I'm pretty sure she's gonna
spin wildly out of control.

967
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:20,993
We're gonna have to do an intervention,
put her through rehab,

968
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:24,923
give her a place to stay while
she's divorcing the hell's angel.

969
00:36:24,938 --> 00:36:28,820
# It don't make a difference #
# If we make it or not #

970
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:32,590
# We've both got one another #
# And that's a lot #

971
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:36,761
# For love #
# Let's give it a shot #

972
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:40,750
# Whoooa #
# We're halfway there #

973
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:44,920
# Ohhh, ohhh #
# We're livin' on a prayer #

974
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,951
Divine. The tomatoes
are so fresh and meaty.

975
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:49,402
The eggplant is what
puts it over the top.

976
00:36:49,437 --> 00:36:50,982
Perfect sweetness.
Your best ever.

977
00:36:50,996 --> 00:36:52,311
Well, I wouldn't say my best.

978
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:55,221
It is. It's a whole new level of flavor,
like a vegetable symphony.

979
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:56,281
What do you think, captain?

980
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:58,100
It's true.
It even surpasses my mother's,

981
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,413
and that woman made
ratatouille for a living.

982
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,632
Well done, Sookie.

983
00:37:02,646 --> 00:37:03,991
Brava, maestra.

984
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:05,442
It's just ratatouille, okay?

985
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,410
Now, go get back to work.

986
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:09,140
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

987
00:37:09,578 --> 00:37:10,910
- Hey.
- Hey!

988
00:37:10,926 --> 00:37:13,071
- You ready to go?
- Ready, Freddy!

989
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,792
Just dropped the kids
off at the Bstics'.

990
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:16,751
They made me take
my shoes off again.

991
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,200
They make everybody
take off their shoes.

992
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,751
I can't remember the last time I saw
the Bstics in anything but socks.

993
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:23,802
Then they had the audacity to
complain that my feet smell.

994
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:24,922
They really complained?

995
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:27,270
Well, they made sour faces
when I wasn't looking

996
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,983
- and rolled their eyes.
- Oh, Jackson.

997
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:32,180
What do they expect?
Of course my feet smell.

998
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:33,892
I work in the fields all day.

999
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:36,920
That's why I wear these big zip boots --
in order to contain the smell.

1000
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:38,783
I swear, the next time they
come over to the house,

1001
00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:41,003
I'm gonna ask them to take
off their pants or something.

1002
00:37:41,038 --> 00:37:42,192
It's outrageous!

1003
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,583
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Yeah, well...

1004
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:47,660
I know the Bostics
are a little nutso.

1005
00:37:47,677 --> 00:37:50,030
Very nutso.
Who irons their couch?

1006
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:52,263
But Martha and Davy
love going over there

1007
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:54,623
and playing with Kayla and Ryan,
and when they come back,

1008
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:58,750
they're so polite and cordial
for like an hour, which is nice.

1009
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:00,490
That is a bonus, but still.

1010
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:03,423
I know. I'll get my purse.

1011
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,602
No!

1012
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:13,950
- What?
- Ooh! Bad batch!

1013
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:16,073
Saving it for the horses.

1014
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,382
But you never mess
up your ratatouille.

1015
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:21,271
Everyone's allowed a mistake
or two here and there.

1016
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:23,641
You know what?
I'm just gonna -- just junk it.

1017
00:38:23,657 --> 00:38:25,651
Are you sure?
It smells fantastic.

1018
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,652
I'm sure. Trust me --
it's awful.

1019
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,581
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

1020
00:38:29,596 --> 00:38:33,100
What do you think about a
nice romantic dinner, huh?

1021
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:34,063
How about Cicero's?

1022
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,650
Wow. Cicero's.

1023
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:36,712
Yeah.

1024
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:38,440
They have good ratatouille.

1025
00:38:38,455 --> 00:38:40,840
Okay, so long as I
can keep my shoes on.

1026
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:44,213
Unless Cicero's has suddenly gone
japanese, I think we're good.

1027
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:14,373
The first name that
I'm going to call is...

1028
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:16,073
A.J.

1029
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:17,932
She was very well-behaved.

1030
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:19,950
Glad to hear it. Lane?

1031
00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:22,512
- Hey, Luke.
- I'm home.

1032
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,882
You zonked out about
20 minutes ago.

1033
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:28,162
Well, I should probably do the rest
of my zonking in my own apartment.

1034
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:30,320
Thank you for hanging out
with me tonight, April.

1035
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:31,260
My pleasure.

1036
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:33,641
- See you tomorrow, Luke.
- See you tomorrow, Lane.

1037
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,133
So, you guys had fun?

1038
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:38,101
Totally. Lane's awesome.

1039
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:39,682
How about you?

1040
00:39:39,695 --> 00:39:44,032
It was nice, you know?
We had vegan food.

1041
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:46,030
Ooh. You couldn't
have liked that.

1042
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:50,042
I did not, but coach Bennett
really seemed to enjoy it.

1043
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,782
So, you're still calling
her "coach Bennett"?

1044
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:56,000
I think she'll just remain
"coach Bennett" to me.

1045
00:39:56,016 --> 00:39:57,531
That's cool.

1046
00:39:58,006 --> 00:40:00,413
Hey, is that pizza
still up for grabs?

1047
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:02,660
- Go crazy.
- Oh. I'm starving.

1048
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:04,481
Real cheese.

1049
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:07,263
We also ordered sticky buns.

1050
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:08,921
Bring it on.

1051
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,812
No quote from
president Stewart yet?

1052
00:40:18,827 --> 00:40:19,450
Nothing.

1053
00:40:19,468 --> 00:40:20,613
Have we picked the photo?

1054
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,071
Sheila's got some
options for you.

1055
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,023
- Layout's coming along.
- Good. Okay.

1056
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:26,192
Keep it moving.
We have a deadline here.

1057
00:40:26,205 --> 00:40:28,470
Ow! Who made this
phone so loud?

1058
00:40:28,486 --> 00:40:30,460
Yale Daily News.

1059
00:40:31,787 --> 00:40:32,791
Will do.

1060
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,811
We got ourselves a quote.
Steve's e-mailing it in now.

1061
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:36,783
Great. Okay, would you mind
inputting these corrections?

1062
00:40:36,815 --> 00:40:38,723
Anything to get away
from that phone.

1063
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:40,021
Hey, gang.

1064
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,013
Hey.

1065
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:42,560
We come bearing
doughnuts and coffee.

1066
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,992
Gather 'round.
The chocolate eclairs are to die for.

1067
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:46,010
Thanks, guys.

1068
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,183
We figured you'd need some
all-nighter supplies.

1069
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:52,550
Hey. So, um, I'm sorry about
getting your staff drunk.

1070
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:53,722
Oh, don't worry about it.

1071
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:55,090
You seemed pretty upset
at the restaurant.

1072
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,761
I was just stressed out.
It's no big deal.

1073
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:58,253
- So, you're not mad?
- No.

1074
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:01,550
But dad, I think I would've liked
it better if on parents' weekend,

1075
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:03,633
I could've just had
lunch with my parents.

1076
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:04,942
Yeah, that would've
been better.

1077
00:41:04,955 --> 00:41:07,142
Next year --
grad-school parents' weekend.

1078
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:09,202
Hey, if it's okay with you,
you mind if we hang out

1079
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,412
- and watch you in action?
- Oh, I don't think you can hang out,

1080
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:13,182
- 'cause you're gonna be late --
- Late for...

1081
00:41:13,215 --> 00:41:15,883
For your dinner reservations
at chez Zinjustin.

1082
00:41:15,898 --> 00:41:17,790
I told grandma and grandpa
that I couldn't make it,

1083
00:41:17,828 --> 00:41:20,503
but I accidentally told them
that you guys were free.

1084
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:22,173
- You're evil.
- You were mad.

1085
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:25,853
Isn't that a coincidence that they
had a reservation there, too?

1086
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:26,870
Oh, don't eat that doughnut,

1087
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:28,491
'cause I hear they have
a crème brûlée that is --

1088
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,371
Don't.

1089
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:31,490
Come on, get your lame-o-parent
selves out the door.

1090
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:32,893
You don't want to be late.
That'll tick them off.

1091
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,910
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1092
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,323
Bye-bye.

1093
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:42,440
