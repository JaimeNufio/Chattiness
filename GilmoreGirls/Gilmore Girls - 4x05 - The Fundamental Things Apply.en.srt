1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,406
What are you doing?

2
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,454
Well, I'm gardening.

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:10,828
What are you doing?

4
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,250
I'm gardening.

5
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:13,592
What are you doing?

6
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:16,551
Why don't you come over here and see, honey, since you seem so confused?

7
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:19,146
Oh, my God. You are gardening.

8
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:21,767
Yeah. Hello. I am gardening.

9
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:22,578
Why?

10
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:24,549
Because Babette bought me a bag of bulbs.

11
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:25,603
Why would she do that?

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,891
She thought that cultivating new life would help distract me

13
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:30,914
from my current emptiness and sense of loss.

14
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,708
Well, that's weirdly sweet of her.

15
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,811
Yes, it was. Anyhow, I forgot about the bulbs 'til Babette brought them up this morning,

16
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:38,070
so I dug them out of the garage.

17
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:40,498
Where they've developed some sort of mold.

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,283
- This is the planet of the mold. 
- Help me.

19
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:47,338
Mom, I'm no botanist, but I don't think anything's gonna grow from this piece of tar.

20
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:48,642
Just put it in the hole and cover it up.

21
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:49,990
Why didn't you just throw them out?

22
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:53,846
- There are eyes everywhere, my dear. 
- Hey, doll, how you doing?

23
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,467
Great, Babette. Just tending my bulbs.

24
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:59,580
- Makes you feel better, doesn't it? 
- Absolutely, much better.

25
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:01,986
- You need any help? 
- Oh, no. I got Rory helping me.

26
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:03,476
- Hi, Babette. 
- Hi, sugar.

27
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:06,564
- Don't worry, I'm looking out for your mom. 
- I'm glad to hear that.

28
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:08,724
Oh, and just you wait 'til spring.

29
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:12,319
You're gonna wake up one morning, walk out, and pow,

30
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:16,664
color coming out of your yin-yang! I'll see you girls tomorrow.

31
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:18,832
I'm going to have color coming out of my yin-yang.

32
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:20,615
Well, then maybe you'll finally get a man.

33
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:24,848
This has got to be the grossest thing ever.

34
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,432
Forget about the bulbs. Let's talk about something else. How's school?

35
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:29,748
School's fine. It's hard but good.

36
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:35,026
Tanna's fine. Janet and Paris are fighting because Janet gets up at 5:30 to go jogging,

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,251
wakes Paris up, and then the resulting argument wakes everybody up, and - oh!

38
00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:42,153
Oh, my God! You bulbed me! You bulbed me!

39
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:45,016
- I was aiming over there. 
- Oh, it got my hand! It got my hand!

40
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,124
- Shake it off. Shake it off. 
- Oh, it won't go! It won't go!

41
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,090
You wiped it on my shirt.

42
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:51,451
It was a reflex.

43
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,464
- To ruin my shirt? 
- I'm sorry.

44
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:56,050
- You never liked this shirt. 
- It's not that. It's just that...

45
00:01:57,705 --> 00:01:59,765
- There's something crawling up my leg! 
- Oh no, oh no! I got it, I got it.

46
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,275
- There's something crawling up my leg! 
- I got it, I got it! It's big!

47
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:10,965
Okay, so the next time that Babette gives you a bag of bulbs to plant

48
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,608
because you're lonely, you say...

49
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:15,612
- No, thank you. 
- Class dismissed.

50
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:12,132
- You could at least open a window. 
- Why?

51
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:15,076
- Because it smells like a locker room in here! 
- Tough luck!

52
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:15,723
Fine!

53
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:19,997
- Did the alarm go off? 
- I shut it off.

54
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:22,316
Who needs an alarm when you've got Workout Barbie around?

55
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,612
Never mind that some of us were up finishing a chem lab 'til 2:30 in the morning!

56
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:29,966
I for one love waking up at five a.m. to the sound of someone

57
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,482
grunting out crunches in the common room!

58
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:33,816
I told you - earplugs.

59
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,049
You know, she talks to herself when she stretches.

60
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,014
"Come on, Janet. Push it, Janet. Love the pain, Janet."

61
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:40,611
- It's pornographic. 
- What time is it?

62
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:43,104
I know what she's doing. It's psychological warfare.

63
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:45,377
Don't let your enemy sleep. Push him 'til he cracks.

64
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,603
Charlie tried the same tricks on our boys at Khe Sanh, and let me tell you,

65
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:51,454
if she keeps this up, I am not gonna be responsible for what happens.

66
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:55,659
Oh, my God! Paris, breakfast is over in five minutes!

67
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:58,009
I know. It's Tuesday, too. That's waffle bar day.

68
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,759
Why didn't you wake me?

69
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:02,586
Oh, sure, blame me. I'm the victim here, remember?

70
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,806
Excuse me, excuse me. Can I... Yes, thank you.

71
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,421
- Rory. 
- Marty.

72
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,373
You remembered.

73
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:32,189
Well, I wasn't the one passed out in the hallway, so I had a better shot.

74
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,774
True, very true. So, I see you're a little late for breakfast.

75
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,504
Yeah. My alarm was turned off.

76
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,501
Hey, you want some eggs or something?

77
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,877
I always take enough for ten. I blame my brother.

78
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:44,555
- He always took the biggest piece of chicken. 
- And left you none?

79
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,295
No, there was plenty more. I just really wanted that big piece.

80
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,476
Oh. Well...

81
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:51,692
- Hey, I want you to meet The Breakfast Crew. 
- Oh, well, I'm kind of...

82
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,631
Well, we all just started eating breakfast together every morning,

83
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:57,057
so someone came up with the name The Breakfast Crew.

84
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,654
I mean, it's not like an official club or anything. There's no hats.

85
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,758
At least not until we can all agree on a color.

86
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:04,819
Excuse me, guys. I want you all to meet Rory.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,453
- Who? 
- The robe.

88
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:10,576
- Oh, the robe. Nice to meet you. 
- I told them about your act of kindness.

89
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:14,241
- Oh, it was nothing, really. 
- I wouldn't say that. That was one nice robe.

90
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,133
- We all took turns trying it on. 
- Not true. Ignore him.

91
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:20,728
- I'm sorry I haven't gotten it back to you yet. 
- Oh, it's okay.

92
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:22,766
- Nice bunny shoes. 
- Thank you.

93
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:25,419
It was nice meeting you all. I actually have to go, so...

94
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:28,008
- I embarrassed you. 
- It's fine.

95
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,178
 I'm sorry. I was just so relieved that I could finally approach you.

96
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:32,468
Why couldn't you approach me?

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,155
Well, that night was really humiliating, so every time I saw you after that,

98
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:39,401
I just hid. But then when I saw you show up this morning like that,

99
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,099
I thought, here's my chance to even the playing field.

100
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,398
Marty, this is not as embarrassing as being totally naked.

101
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:48,244
No, it's not. But it's close

102
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:53,281
Well, consider the playing field leveled.

103
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:56,088
Good. See ya, Rory.

104
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:57,040
See ya, Marty.

105
00:05:57,977 --> 00:06:00,490
Exactly, yes, that's just the kind of thing we're looking for.

106
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:06,839
Well, I'm so glad to hear that because the last three designers we met with

107
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:09,179
had very different philosophies.

108
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:14,356
No, I didn't know you did the Silver Thatch Inn. Oh, that was so beautiful.

109
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:16,163
Yeah.

110
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:20,987
Okay. Well, why don't we meet Friday,

111
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:22,251
say, around two o'clock?

112
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:27,233
Okay. Luke's Diner. It's right in the middle of the town square.

113
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,224
You can't miss it. Just follow the love.

114
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:31,185
Okay. Thank you.

115
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:32,624
Bye-bye.

116
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,763
- What was that? 
- I was taking it outside.

117
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,607
Three people came in while you held the door open.

118
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:39,648
- You're exaggerating. 
- Why can't you respect the rules of my diner?

119
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:43,077
I do respect the rules of your diner. It's that baseball cap I have issues with.

120
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:49,546
All right, I've done extensive research, checked references,

121
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:53,258
and prescreened three other designers for you. Here are their names.

122
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:56,504
Well, hopefully I won't need these. I think I just found a new designer for the inn.

123
00:06:56,653 --> 00:07:00,134
Well, good. I love doing research just for the sake of doing research.

124
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:02,085
I live to grow. Are you still buying me lunch?

125
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:04,783
I'd be happy to buy you lunch, but I should probably take you somewhere else.

126
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,114
Why should you take him somewhere else?

127
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:08,792
Because, Kook Danes, Michel eats a very specific diet.

128
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:12,699
Normally, yes, that's true. However, every six months I give myself a crazy day

129
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:16,385
where I can eat anything I want, and today's crazy day.

130
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,797
- Talk to me about your chocolate cake. 
- What do you want to know?

131
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,655
- Is it Mexican? 
- Is what Mexican?

132
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:22,498
- The chocolate. 
- How would I know?

133
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,684
It would say so on the wrapper. You could go look.

134
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:27,905
I'll wait.

135
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,894
Take him somewhere else.

136
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:35,846
Oh, just bring me a doughnut, but put some sprinkles on it, okay?

137
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:38,770
Do you know what one of life's great mysteries is?

138
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:41,985
Whether or not you're going to be joining us for Friday night dinner.

139
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:47,208
And since you pretend to be ignorant of the concept of the RSVP even

140
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:48,831
though I know it was taught to you as a child,

141
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:52,035
I am reduced to calling and asking you, are you coming?

142
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,399
Is that "uh huh, yes, I'm coming"

143
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,107
or "uh huh, I was reading while you were talking"?

144
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,755
Tell you what, Mom - plan on me coming,

145
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:03,806
and if I don't, then it'll just be a little more for everyone else.

146
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:06,797
Lorelai, you know very well our dinners do not work like that.

147
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,747
There is careful planning and shopping and preparation

148
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:13,377
that goes into every meal no matter how boring and simple it may seem to you.

149
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:14,365
Oh, Mom...

150
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,326
Hey, what...

151
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:19,889
- Get off that phone! 
- Oh, shoot, Mom, there's no cell phones in here.

152
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:21,174
I'll call you back later. Bye.

153
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,180
And when I need you - nowhere.

154
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:29,263
It's obvious Hemingway is just using Jake's impotence to indict a society

155
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,340
which exploited its underclass to fight in the trenches of the first World War.

156
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:34,670
Interesting theory, Heather.

157
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:36,160
What does everyone else think?

158
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,167
I don't know. I mean, isn't Jake's impotence more about

159
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,265
that generation's loss of faith in love?

160
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:45,186
Please. That grossly ignores the social context.

161
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,470
Rory's right. The book's about a guy who can't sleep with the woman he loves.

162
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,232
- It's not some Woody Guthrie song. 
- But...

163
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:51,100
Okay, hold that thought, Heather. We're out of time.

164
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:55,007
Okay, everyone, we'll continue this Thursday. I'll see you all then.

165
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,809
- Thanks for the save. 
- No problem.

166
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:59,632
Heather can get a little "workers of the world, unite" sometimes.

167
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:02,365
Yeah, I've never actually met someone who likes the word bourgeois so much.

168
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,069
So, what are you up to this weekend?

169
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:08,570
Oh, studying. Sleep, hopefully. A rarity in my dorm room.

170
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,736
- Yeah? Do you eat? 
- Habitually.

171
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:12,907
Ever been to Pancia di Lucca? I hear it's good.

172
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,090
No, I haven't.

173
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:17,663
- I was thinking of going there this weekend. 
- Oh, cool. Tell me how it is.

174
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:21,254
Okay, I will. Or, hey, you could come with me.

175
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:24,350
I can't this Saturday, but if it's good, maybe another time, okay?

176
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:27,453
Sure, okay. So, see you next week.

177
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:28,385
Bye, Trevor.

178
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,539
Hey, what are you doing home?

179
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,837
Well, it seems that if you leave your laundry in the machine

180
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:42,050
for even two minutes after it stops, some incredibly impatient person will come

181
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:44,073
and take your nice clean clothes out and dump them.

182
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,000
- Where? 
- Anywhere.

183
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:47,749
The floor, the top of another dirty washing machine.

184
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:50,652
My Belle and Sebastian t-shirt was in the garbage.

185
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:54,184
So now, on top of a massive amount of reading and studying,

186
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:56,955
I get to rewash my formerly perfect clean clothes.

187
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:59,448
Well, that's just wrong. I think you should quit school in protest.

188
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:00,744
Okay, if you say so.

189
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,500
Oh, no, wait. That's not ours.

190
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,995
What do you mean it's not ours? Who's it for?

191
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:06,944
- I've got five minutes. Where's the pizza? 
- There.

192
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,125
- Thanks. Hi, Rory. 
- Hey, Lane.

193
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:11,920
My mom ordered all the okra in the Western Hemisphere.

194
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,178
- She got a great deal and I'm starving to death. 
- Swallow.

195
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:18,337
Between Seventh Day Adventist college and my mom's new fascination

196
00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:21,111
with ordering on the internet, my future looks very grim.

197
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,092
- You want a Coke? 
- No, no time for liquids.

198
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:25,458
I have to be home for dinner in four minutes. Another piece, please?

199
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,610
Great. Okay, this is good. You all look good. Things are good?

200
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:31,659
- Things are... 
- Okay, gotta go. Thanks for the grub.

201
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:36,047
- She is so throwing up on the way home. 
- I'm gonna go put this stuff in the washer.

202
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,877
Wait, have some pizza and tell Mama all about your day.

203
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:44,157
Okay. Oh, yesterday Janet woke up to find that Paris had chaired her in her room.

204
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:45,350
Oh, nice.

205
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,652
And then, later, when Janet had climbed out the window,

206
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:52,988
she retaliated by gluing shut the opening of Paris' glue gun.

207
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:56,154
- Wow, she went for the crafts. 
- This war is getting totally out of hand.

208
00:10:56,246 --> 00:11:00,070
This morning Paris turned off my alarm because Janet woke her up.

209
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:04,211
I almost missed breakfast. I ran down to the dining hall in my pajamas

210
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:05,977
and bunny slippers, and of course I ran into Marty.

211
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,886
- Naked guy. 
- It was totally humiliating.

212
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:10,846
Humiliating 'cause naked guy's hot?

213
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:14,160
It was humiliating because I had terrycloth rabbits on my feet.

214
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:15,508
So naked guy's not hot?

215
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:19,520
Naked guy is Marty, and it's not like that. He's sweet.

216
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,375
Sweet means bad butt.

217
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,929
Sweet does not mean bad butt. Sweet means sweet.

218
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,085
Poor naked guy. He should've left his clothes on.

219
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:28,937
Okay, you have got to stop talking about naked guy. I just met Marty.

220
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,568
All right. If not him, are there any other guys on the horizon?

221
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:32,264
Nope.

222
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:36,304
No? How about a professor - someone older, wiser,

223
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:39,111
- with brown cords and whiskey breath? 
- Oh, well, yeah. There's one of those.

224
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:40,175
Come on, Rory.

225
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,939
Well, this guy asked me to go try this restaurant this weekend,

226
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,382
- but it was a totally casual thing. 
- So what'd you tell him?

227
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,275
- That I was busy. 
- You don't like him?

228
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:50,968
No, I like him fine. I mean, he's smart,

229
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:54,096
and he takes my side in the debates, and he's decent to look at.

230
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,318
So, why'd you say no? Too many clothes?

231
00:11:56,472 --> 00:12:00,317
I don't know. He... he carries a bottle of water around with him all the time.

232
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:03,553
- That's just weird. 
- Right. Hydration. Very creepy.

233
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:05,457
And he's preppy, and I don't really like preppy.

234
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:07,711
Plus, he's gonna go study in Barcelona next year.

235
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:10,239
- So? 
- So it's a waste of time. It can't go anywhere.

236
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,324
- It could go to dinner, maybe a movie. 
- Mom...

237
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:14,787
No, look, Rory, I know you've never really dated.

238
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:16,871
What are you talking about? I've dated.

239
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:18,385
- Who did you date? 
- Dean.

240
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:20,444
You and Dean did not date. You had a relationship.

241
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:22,809
- Well, Jess. 
- Was relationship number two.

242
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:25,467
So maybe I've never dated, but you haven't either.

243
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,776
I have dated at least once.

244
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:31,161
- You had me with dad - relationship. 
- Yes, but...

245
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:34,505
Max - relationship. Dad again - relationship.

246
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,166
Okay, fine, I may not be the world's best dater,

247
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:40,227
but I do it and you should give it a shot. I mean, you're in college now.

248
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,159
What else is there to do in college but date?

249
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,125
I'm gonna go wash my clothes now.

250
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:47,852
Wait. Was that it?

251
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:49,782
Is this conversation over?

252
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:51,799
Sorry, did I win?

253
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,613
- Here, I wanted to show you this. 
- Castles of Ireland?

254
00:12:57,354 --> 00:12:59,900
There is a room in here that I've always wanted to do.

255
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:02,059
Here it is.

256
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:05,752
Oh, I love that. What is that wall treatment?

257
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:08,469
- That's anaglypta wallpaper. 
- What are you doing?

258
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:10,877
I'm looking at anaglypta wallpaper.

259
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,577
And the other three tables are here for support?

260
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:15,070
Well, we just had a lot of books to go through.

261
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:19,156
Luke, this is Natalie Zimmerman. Natalie's gonna help us design the Dragonfly.

262
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,321
- Nice to meet you. 
- Did I tell you we're gonna have horses?

263
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:23,328
The property already has stables, so why not?

264
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:26,446
I love horses. I've always loved horses ever since I was a little girl,

265
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:28,813
and now I finally have a grown-up excuse to buy a pony.

266
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:32,781
Great. Listen, National Velvet, you have to move this stuff out of here.

267
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:35,094
- Why? 
- Because this is a diner. People wanna sit.

268
00:13:35,268 --> 00:13:38,545
- This is business. 
- No, this is business,

269
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:42,129
and it's open, and it's decorated, and it wants its seats back.

270
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:42,989
Fine.

271
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:48,079
Sorry about that. He's trying to steal the "World's Grumpiest Diner Guy" title from Mel.

272
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,832
No problem.

273
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:51,453
So you were telling me about anaglypta wallpaper?

274
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:54,648
Yes, it's a textured paper that we can paint or treat.

275
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:57,981
We can even distress it if you want to give it a more, you know, vintage-y look.

276
00:13:58,232 --> 00:13:59,055
That sounds interesting.

277
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:02,645
You know, Emily actually has some in the smaller upstairs guest bath.

278
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:04,391
You should take a look at it the next time you're there.

279
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,967
- Emily? You mean like my mother, Emily? 
- Yes.

280
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,305
- I didn't know you knew Emily. 
- Oh, yeah.

281
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:12,952
I did her second-floor remodel about a year ago. I thought that's how you got my name.

282
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:15,982
Oh, no, I got your name from a magazine.

283
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,677
- So you know Emily? 
- It's a small world, isn't it?

284
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,510
Yes, yes, really small.

285
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:23,039
About the same square footage as that box they threw McCain in.

286
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,402
So, are you ready to see bedrooms?

287
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,010
Yes, sure. Why not?

288
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:30,632
Next week we finish up with "Snows of Kilimanjaro",

289
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,391
then it is Hemingway's pal Scott Fitzgerald,

290
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,818
so do yourselves a favor - get a jump on "Tender is the Night."

291
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,486
- Good session today, huh? 
- It was fine.

292
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,619
I can't believe we sit around and talk about books and get graded on it.

293
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:51,010
I mean, there's almost nothing I like more than talking about a good book

294
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,866
or a bad book or a really thick magazine.

295
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:57,655
Hey, Trevor.

296
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,153
You know what else I like to do besides talk about a really good book?

297
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:05,541
Eat. Isn't that weird? And, actually, for me, they're linked.

298
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,142
It's true. When I talk about a book, I get really hungry - starving.

299
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:12,002
- You ever experience that? 
- Not really.

300
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,193
Oh. Well, it happens to me all the time.

301
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,629
Like right now, for example, starving, really.

302
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:20,234
And I enjoyed "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" so much

303
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:23,169
that I will probably be hungry for quite some time.

304
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:26,420
All weekend, probably. Especially Saturday night.

305
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,303
- Saturday night? 
- Saturday night.

306
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:30,551
Are you saying you want to go to dinner on Saturday night?

307
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:33,306
Wow. Okay.

308
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:35,277
Yeah. Well, I will be hungry.

309
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:37,116
Well, that fact has been pretty well established.

310
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,141
Okay. Sure. Yeah, let's go to dinner Saturday night.

311
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:42,154
- So, you're at... 
- Durfee, suite 5.

312
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:44,110
- I'll pick you up at 7:30. 
- Sounds good.

313
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,032
Okay.

314
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,416
I gotta hand it to you there, Trevor. You sure are persistent.

315
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:52,348
- Davey? You're naming him Davey? 
- Yes.

316
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,011
- I love Davey. 
- Me, too.

317
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:56,474
Oh, I can't believe you finally picked a name. It makes it real.

318
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:00,484
Yes, because the stomach and massive ankles were too ambiguous.

319
00:16:00,653 --> 00:16:01,785
Does Jackson like it?

320
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:05,276
Well, he's okay with the stomach, but the massive ankles freak him out.

321
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:06,346
The name Davey.

322
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:08,789
- It was actually his suggestion. 
- Really?

323
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:12,644
He wanted Davey if it was a boy and Colgate if it was a girl.

324
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,784
- Colgate? 
- His great-grandmother's name.

325
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:16,196
Great-grandmother Colgate.

326
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,370
That's horrible.

327
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,296
You know what's worse, she looked like a Colgate.

328
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:20,702
Well, at least you know it's gonna be a boy.

329
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,582
Yes, but he doesn't know it's going to be a boy.

330
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:27,358
And I realized he has to know that I thought Colgate was an insane name,

331
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:31,136
but if I didn't fight him on it, it must be because I knew we weren't gonna have a girl

332
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,826
and then he would know we were gonna have a boy,

333
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:36,043
and that would spoil everything for him. So I told him,

334
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,515
"We are not naming our daughter after a toothpaste!"

335
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:40,416
We got in a big fight and we're not talking.

336
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,739
- Cool! 
- Yeah, I know. Everything's perfect.

337
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:45,826
My baby has a name and my husband's sleeping on the couch.

338
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,381
Oh, and I figured out that I'll go with the Avery stove for the inn.

339
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,888
Is that okay? Because I know it's a little more expensive.

340
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:52,745
It's your kitchen, Sookie.

341
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:56,257
Okay, good. I'm gonna call Natalie the minute I get home.

342
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,919
- What's wrong? 
- Nothing.

343
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,480
- It's the Avery. It's too extravagant. 
- No, the Avery's fine. Everything's fine.

344
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:04,919
- You're sure? 
- I'm sure.

345
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:09,584
- Just... Natalie knows my mother. 
- Emily? How?

346
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:12,635
Yes, because she did her second-floor remodel like a year ago.

347
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,443
Oh, so she really knows your mother.

348
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:15,902
They've been shopping together. It's a bond.

349
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:19,998
- Sookie, I don't know if I... 
- Lorelai, no.

350
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:21,576
- She knows my mother. 
- So what?

351
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:25,369
Sookie, my whole life, my whole existence, my essence,

352
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,856
my being, my ability to be this sparkling creature standing here before you --

353
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,037
all of this depends on the complete and total separation

354
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:33,475
of my life from my mother's life. That's how it works.

355
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:35,853
- But we like Natalie. 
- We do like Natalie.

356
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:38,584
Remember all the other designers we met that we didn't like before Natalie?

357
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:41,149
Remember the one that wanted to put the tiny mannequin in every room

358
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,401
so that the lonely people would have someone to talk to?

359
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,187
- Yes, I do. 
- Or the purple, purple, purple guy.

360
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,256
- Purple, purple, purple. 
- They were horrible.

361
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,063
And then we met Natalie, and she was perfect.

362
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:54,578
Look, just try. At least give Natalie a chance, okay? Please?

363
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:55,997
- I'll try. 
- Good.

364
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:58,009
I'm gonna go home and get going on the Avery.

365
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,416
All right. I have to stop by Luke's. I'll call you later.

366
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:03,196
- Okay. It's going to be fine. 
- Yes, it is.

367
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:07,200
Hey, Luke. What's going on?

368
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,372
Oh, well... Tom called.

369
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:13,646
The banister on the stairs has to be replaced. It'll be $4,000.

370
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:16,687
Tamsin Cordally called. He needs a deposit on the quartersawn oak.

371
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:20,671
It'll be $4,000. Julio the landscaper called. I have no idea what he said,

372
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,295
but it's going to be $4,000. Vicki from Vicki's Horse Supply called.

373
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:29,012
She thinks Pepper and Gunsmoke would suit your needs, but Gunsmoke snores,

374
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,966
so the stables can't be too close to the guests' bedrooms.

375
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:34,993
Rory's looking for her black Converse, and, oh, one last thing -

376
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,230
- I'm not taking messages for you anymore! 
- Sorry.

377
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:40,567
- What did you do, have business cards printed up? 
- People just know I'm here a lot.

378
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,617
I missed a call from my meat guy because I was on the phone

379
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:44,690
discussing Gunsmoke's deviated septum.

380
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:47,793
I'm gonna call all these people today and tell them never to call me here again.

381
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,590
- You bet you will. 
- Consider it done.

382
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:50,312
Good.

383
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:51,633
- Just... 
- What?

384
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:55,119
Just one more thing. Did a package arrive for me here today?

385
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,496
- What? 
- I'm sorry. Never mind, never mind.

386
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:59,180
Luke. Sorry. I'm cutting it kind of close here.

387
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:02,056
Oh, sorry, Ed. I didn't realize you were cutting it kind of close.

388
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:05,109
Everybody, drop everything. Ed's cutting it kind of close.

389
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:07,424
- Here's your tickets. 
- You seem mad.

390
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:10,813
Look, Ed, just go to the game and enjoy it, okay?

391
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:13,356
- Choke on a hot dog while you're at it. 
- I have to tell you, Luke,

392
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:15,717
I am never accepting anything free from you again.

393
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:20,864
What a threat! Boy, you're a real master of fear, there, Ed.

394
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,558
Look out, Jason and Freddy.

395
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,793
Ed may never mooch off of either one of you ever again!

396
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:30,520
- What is wrong with you? 
- Nothing.

397
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,481
- You're yelling at Ed. 
- Ah, Ed bugs me.

398
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,763
- Ed cries. 
- I'm just having a bad day.

399
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,249
Excuse me?

400
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:39,900
Days. You've been stomping around, barking at people for days.

401
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,382
- I have not. 
- Yes, Cujo, you have.

402
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:45,561
- I always talk to people like that. 
- No, Benji, you don't.

403
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:48,300
- I'll be fine tomorrow. 
- Really, Lassie? Why is that?

404
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,966
Look, I bought these tickets for Nicole 'cause she's a Yankees fan.

405
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:53,944
I thought it'd be nice if we went to a game together.

406
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:56,647
- Oh, man. 
- And it's no big deal.

407
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,915
I mean, the closer it got to the game, the more I felt like a loser.

408
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,427
I mean, I'm sitting on these tickets, which means I thought I'd still be in a relationship.

409
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:06,406
I don't know. Stupid. I broke my own rule. I asked for it.

410
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:08,924
What are you talking about?

411
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,758
Never plan for anything more than two days in advance.

412
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:15,099
That's your rule?

413
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:17,731
Yes, 'cause when you make plans, then you have expectations,

414
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:20,861
and when you have expectations, then you will get disappointed.

415
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:23,200
Having expectations also gives you something to look forward to.

416
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:25,749
Yes, then you're looking forward to being constantly disappointed.

417
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,700
- You're not that cynical. 
- I am today.

418
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:29,109
Hey, I have an idea.

419
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,697
- Tomorrow night is usually movie night. 
- What?

420
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,937
Rory and I would always rent a bunch of movies, order food -- it was our thing.

421
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:41,231
Now she's at school and busy, so why don't you come over? It might be fun.

422
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,879
- Okay. 
- Yeah?

423
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:47,355
- Sure, what else have I got to do? 
- Ah, I love when men say that to me.

424
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:48,160
What time?

425
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:49,460
- Eight. 
- Eight it is.

426
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:52,030
I'll stop by the video store and pick us up a couple movies. What do you want to see?

427
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,326
I don't know.

428
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,556
Come on, tell me. I don't want to get something you've seen.

429
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:58,516
Don't worry about it. I haven't seen anything.

430
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:01,119
- People always say that. 
- Well, with me, it's true.

431
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,982
- "Casablanca"? 
- Nope.

432
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:05,532
You have never seen "Casablanca"? Are you kidding?

433
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,145
Just get anything, please.

434
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:08,549
- "Chinatown"? 
- Anything at all.

435
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:10,882
- "Bonnie and Clyde"? 
- A video game would be nice also.

436
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:12,863
"It Happened One Night"? "His Girl Friday"?

437
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,633
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre"? "Diner"?

438
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,300
I saw "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge."

439
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,863
Oh. My house, eight o'clock. We have such work to do.

440
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:23,826
I'll see you there.

441
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:28,327
Oh, by the way, if my package arrives today, bring it with you, okay? Thanks.

442
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,979
Hold on, whoa.

443
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,155
Wow, that could have been very ugly, huh?

444
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:42,694
The great cappuccino disaster of 2003. Very sad -- Shelley Winters drowns.

445
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,573
Think the coffee was stronger than I thought.

446
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:45,852
- Can I take your coat? 
- Thank you.

447
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:48,530
Your daughter called and said she was gonna be late. Her class ran long.

448
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,525
- Oh, so Rory's not here yet? 
- No, it's just you and your mother.

449
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:57,500
Gosh. You know what? I just remembered I left something in the car,

450
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:00,414
so I'll be right back. Could I - just - it's new.

451
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:03,348
I can't be away from it just yet. Oh, thanks.

452
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:04,719
Okay. Back in a flash.

453
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:41,302
What are you doing?

454
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:44,267
I was looking for my lip gloss.

455
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,858
You need the radio on to look for your lip gloss?

456
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:49,910
Well, I came out here and I couldn't find it

457
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:53,074
and so I thought maybe if I tried to retrace my steps, it would turn up.

458
00:22:53,227 --> 00:22:55,019
- Very clever idea. 
- Yeah, I thought so.

459
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:57,984
So I put my purse on the seat and I put the keys in the car,

460
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,559
and naturally the radio came on 'cause that's what it does, and,

461
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:03,968
"Shadow Dancing" was playing, which was one of my all time favorite songs in junior high.

462
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:06,682
- And you forgot to look for your lip gloss. 
- Just for a second.

463
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:09,750
Which makes sense since it's in the ashtray right next to you.

464
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,488
Oh, hey. It is. Look at that.

465
00:23:12,612 --> 00:23:14,465
Yes, it's a miracle. Come inside, Lorelai.

466
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:17,097
Well, can't I just wait 'til the song... I'm coming.

467
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:20,302
You can't sit here for three seconds without Rory.

468
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:21,310
Not true.

469
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:24,090
Oh, stop it and sit down. I want to talk to you about something.

470
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:29,149
I just found out that Sookie is pregnant.

471
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,470
Don't look at me, I had nothing to do with it.

472
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,510
- May I ask why you didn't bother to tell me? 
- Well...

473
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:40,128
Lorelai, your not telling me about Sookie is unforgivable.

474
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:42,860
- Why, it's not like you're such good friends. 
- I went to her wedding.

475
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:44,110
So did Kirk.

476
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:46,818
I haven't sent her a gift, Lorelai. How does that make me look?

477
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,886
Like you hate her and all childbearing women.

478
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:50,842
You are so intent on keeping me out of your life.

479
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,634
It's not even my life. It's Sookie's life.

480
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:55,241
A simple phone call to tell me that Sookie is pregnant.

481
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,988
How did you find out about it, anyway?

482
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,854
Why, are you going to track down the informant and have him shot?

483
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:00,704
Maybe.

484
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:03,970
It doesn't matter how I found out. I found out, no thanks to you.

485
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:05,721
Mom, please, just tell me how you found out.

486
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:08,036
Why? Does it bother you not knowing?

487
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:09,551
- Yes. 
- Me, too.

488
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:12,573
- Rory, you're here. 
- I'm so sorry I'm late, Grandma.

489
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:13,740
- Hi, Mom. 
- You'll pay.

490
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,818
So come on, sit down and tell me all about Yale.

491
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,217
If you don't, she'll find out anyway.

492
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,094
Yale's interesting. It's a lot more free-form than I thought.

493
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:22,888
Well, you're an adult now. They treat you like an adult in college.

494
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,733
In college, yes. In the Gilmore house...

495
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:26,806
We've switched subjects, in case you were wondering.

496
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:30,200
So tell me, what are your plans for the weekend? Any parties going on?

497
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:33,318
Yeah, there are always parties going on, but I'm not going to a party this weekend.

498
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,617
- I'm actually going on a date. 
- You are?

499
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:38,419
- Well, your first college date. 
- Who's the lucky guy?

500
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:40,470
- Just a guy from my English class. 
- No.

501
00:24:40,656 --> 00:24:42,745
- Your English class. 
- What happened?

502
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:44,515
- I thought you turned him down. 
- You turned him down?

503
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:47,092
I know, but I thought about it and I reconsidered.

504
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:48,209
What did you do? Did you ask him out?

505
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,261
You asked him out? Oh, Rory, tell me you didn't ask a boy out.

506
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:53,169
I didn't ask him out. I just made sure he knew I was available.

507
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:55,251
- Better, Mom? 
- No, that's not better.

508
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:59,851
Rory, you're in Yale, not Amsterdam. How you conduct yourself socially

509
00:24:59,953 --> 00:25:02,499
is as important as how you conduct yourself academically.

510
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,171
I promise, it was very proper.

511
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:07,141
Yes, Mom, she had a nice Tiffany lampshade over her red light.

512
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:09,641
What do you know about this boy? Do you know where he's from, who his parents are?

513
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:11,770
No, I plan to find that out on the date.

514
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:13,543
- What are you gonna wear? 
- I don't know.

515
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:14,672
Do you want to borrow something of mine?

516
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,562
- No, she does not. 
- What does that mean?

517
00:25:16,707 --> 00:25:19,998
It's bad enough that you haven't taught your daughter how to interact with the opposite sex.

518
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:23,142
You will not dress her up in one of your "Sex and the City" ensembles

519
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:26,573
and send her out to tell the entire campus, "Don't worry. I'll ask you."

520
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:28,354
How do you know about "Sex and the City"?

521
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:32,748
Okay, see, something like this outside against a wall -

522
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:34,320
very "Little House on the Prairie" with a twist.

523
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,705
I love "Little House on the Prairie." Jack the dog.

524
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:38,871
Where is Lindsay Sidney Greenbush?

525
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,662
When she came tumbling down the hill, I would just laugh.

526
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:44,129
- Lorelai? 
- Yeah?

527
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:46,895
- What do you think? 
- I don't know. I'm not really sure.

528
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:50,586
Okay. Well, just keep in mind that anything you see here I can have duplicated.

529
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:54,046
I've got this guy in Delaware that can knock off anything for about half the price.

530
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:55,045
Maybe we should go.

531
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,073
What? We just got started.

532
00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:59,474
Well, maybe we should think a little more before we shop.

533
00:25:59,736 --> 00:26:01,615
What are you talking about? We've been thinking for months.

534
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:06,074
Let's start buying! Holy mother of God, this bench is $15,000.

535
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:07,463
We can find something else.

536
00:26:07,677 --> 00:26:10,134
- Oh, no, we don't have to find something else. 
- What are you talking about?

537
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:12,516
We have absolutely no problem paying full price for that bench.

538
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:13,605
- What? 
- Yeah.

539
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:15,945
No money problems or problems of any kind.

540
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:19,089
Our entire lives are perfect. We have no complaints and plenty of money.

541
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,949
- What are you talking about? 
- You know what,

542
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:24,042
I see a lawn jockey out there that looks very interesting. I'll be back.

543
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:30,599
- We cannot afford that bench. 
- Oh, I know that. I don't want her to know that.

544
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:32,304
- Her - Natalie, her? 
- Yes.

545
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:34,480
- Why? 
- Because it could get back to my mother.

546
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:37,204
- What could get back to your mother? 
- That we have money problems.

547
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,525
We do have money problems.

548
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:41,315
I know, but I don't want my mother knowing that we have money problems.

549
00:26:41,453 --> 00:26:44,363
I don't want any personal information leaked out because in Emily's hands,

550
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,620
- that could be a weapon. 
- Well, Natalie's not gonna say anything.

551
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,051
How do you know? How do you know she's not filling my mother in

552
00:26:49,144 --> 00:26:51,862
- on our every move on a daily basis? 
- You're being paranoid.

553
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:54,524
Oh, yeah? My mother found out about you being pregnant.

554
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:56,814
- Not from Natalie. 
- How do you know?

555
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,855
Because Natalie herself didn't know until about a half an hour ago.

556
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:00,725
That's her story.

557
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:03,674
Okay. This is getting crazy now.

558
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,799
You have got to go out there and talk to her about this.

559
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:09,608
- I don't know. 
- It's the only fair thing. Come on. Go.

560
00:27:16,566 --> 00:27:20,939
Hey, look, Natalie, I have to say something to you.

561
00:27:21,027 --> 00:27:23,596
I feel a tad silly even mentioning it, but I think I have to.

562
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:26,111
- Did I do something that... 
- No, you did nothing.

563
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:29,080
You've been great, really. Great ideas, great attitude.

564
00:27:29,423 --> 00:27:31,593
- It's just that... you know my mother. 
- Yes?

565
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,134
That's it. You know my mother.

566
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:39,187
And my mother and I don't exactly have the smoothest of relationships.

567
00:27:40,554 --> 00:27:44,497
Right. I mean, we're not warring or anything, but it's just that we're very different,

568
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:48,424
and I feel kind of weird sharing things with her.

569
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:51,552
Look, I promise you, I haven't been in contact with your mother for a long time.

570
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:54,674
Maybe twice she called to get a couple of names, but that was it.

571
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:56,262
I hadn't even met you yet.

572
00:27:56,646 --> 00:27:59,805
So trust me -- she knows nothing that you haven't told her yourself.

573
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:02,832
Oh. Okay. I feel really stupid right now.

574
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,028
No, don't. I enjoyed working with your mother,

575
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:08,064
but this inn is the kid of thing that I love to do.

576
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:11,034
And the place has incredible potential and somebody's gonna get a chance

577
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:15,964
to make it a wonderful inn. I would be heartsick if I lost this opportunity.

578
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,072
Look, I haven't spoken to Emily in months.

579
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:21,130
I doubt I'll be speaking to her in the future. I promise.

580
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:23,562
- Okay. 
- Really?

581
00:28:23,674 --> 00:28:25,461
- Absolutely. 
- I'm so glad.

582
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:26,399
So am I.

583
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:28,550
So now that I talked myself back into a job,

584
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:31,437
what do you think the outlook for this lawn jockey is?

585
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,045
Not good.

586
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:35,021
- Emily would hate it. 
- Wrap it up.

587
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,432
Okay, so this is option number four.

588
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:40,479
Tanna?

589
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:41,763
Tanna?

590
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,421
- We're doing the whole bonding thing now. 
- Okay. Sorry. Start again.

591
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:48,610
What do you think?

592
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:51,333
Men respond subconsciously to a woman's pheromones.

593
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:54,595
You should run in place 'til he gets here. It'll give you a nice musk.

594
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:55,757
Go back to your leg.

595
00:28:57,012 --> 00:28:58,328
Roommates meeting starts in two minutes.

596
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,624
Hey, I told you to stop with the math and the Sharpies on my good sheets.

597
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:02,731
Okay. Sorry.

598
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:06,217
- How come the puppy doesn't pee on your bed? 
- I'll be right out, Paris.

599
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:06,843
Hurry up.

600
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:09,070
All right, everyone, take a seat, please.

601
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,752
Rory, one last curtsy, and let's move.

602
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:15,561
My date will be here in ten minutes, so talk fast.

603
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:17,282
Thank you all for coming.

604
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,938
Now, I'd like to start this meeting by saying that no one here is on trial.

605
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,467
This meeting is about healing, it is about redemption,

606
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:26,289
it is about accepting responsibility and making amends.

607
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:27,210
I don't believe this.

608
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:30,640
This is a forum for all of us to air our grievances so we can resolve them

609
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:31,865
and go on with our lives.

610
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:34,306
Hey, since I'm already standing, why don't I start?

611
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:35,627
This is thrilling.

612
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:39,093
Setting your alarm for 5:30 in the morning when no one else here

613
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:42,406
shares the desire to put on nylon shorts and run in circles for an hour

614
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,029
like a greyhound is selfish.

615
00:29:44,203 --> 00:29:46,488
I have a partial athletic scholarship, Paris.

616
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:49,494
The grunting and the sweating, and there are plastic balls everywhere.

617
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,044
- One balance ball. 
- No one can sleep.

618
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:53,804
No one can breathe. Rory missed breakfast the other day.

619
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,913
You've seen Rory eat. She cannot miss breakfast.

620
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,008
Paris has a point there.

621
00:29:57,173 --> 00:29:58,816
Excuse me, but if I remember correctly,

622
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:01,326
Rory missed breakfast because you turned her alarm off.

623
00:30:01,438 --> 00:30:03,050
Janet does have a point there.

624
00:30:03,163 --> 00:30:05,887
And while we're airing grievances, what about your stupid craft area?

625
00:30:06,077 --> 00:30:09,251
Everywhere you turn, there's glitter or seashells or macaroni.

626
00:30:09,396 --> 00:30:12,795
- And the smell of the glue. 
- Hey, I make things we can all enjoy.

627
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:15,898
I am contributing. The coasters I make are for everyone.

628
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,637
Those push-ups are for you and you alone.

629
00:30:17,756 --> 00:30:20,264
- I vote we get rid of craft corner. 
- No, that's my emotional homework!

630
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:22,629
Okay, let's just all calm down for a sec.

631
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:24,949
No. I cannot calm down. I have tried to be reasonable.

632
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,500
I have told myself over and over, "God, look at her.

633
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:29,737
Imagine what she's been through to make her turn out like that."

634
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:31,375
- A lot! 
- But you're impossible!

635
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:33,863
And frankly, I'm just sick of your constant negativity!

636
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:36,823
You're on steroids, aren't you? That's what's behind this obsessive behavior.

637
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:38,087
You're calling me obsessive?

638
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:44,128
- I am not intimidated or afraid of you. 
- Hi. You ready to go?

639
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:46,300
Just one sec. We're finishing up a roommates meeting.

640
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:47,963
- I'll race you. 
- What?

641
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:50,622
To Hewitt Quad and back. I win, no alarm before seven a.m.

642
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:52,842
You win, I move my crafts area into Rory's and my room.

643
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,069
- Forget it. I am not gonna race...
- On your mark, get set, go.

644
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:00,741
Now they're gonna have a nice musk.

645
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:02,915
- Shall we? 
- After you.

646
00:31:07,553 --> 00:31:09,915
Ah, man bearing bags of food. Come in.

647
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:12,105
- I went a little overboard here. 
- No such thing.

648
00:31:12,232 --> 00:31:15,131
I got tons of fries, half a pumpkin pie. You got whipped cream here?

649
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,877
Always.

650
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,557
And, I wasn't sure what to do with the burgers

651
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,898
because sometimes you order with double cheese, sometimes you don't,

652
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,212
so I brought one with normal cheese and one with...

653
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,068
- What did you do? 
- I ordered food.

654
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:27,189
I said I'd bring food.

655
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,160
So I can't contribute, like I'm a piker?

656
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,464
No. Just that I didn't need to bring food.

657
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:35,499
I'm leftover girl. I'll have the burgers tonight and the Chinese food during the week.

658
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,842
Then you just should have ordered the Chinese fresh tomorrow instead of tonight.

659
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:42,088
I don't like fresh Chinese food. I like stale Chinese food.

660
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,810
I give up.

661
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,720
- I got you a nice, cold beer. 
- Appreciate it.

662
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:52,584
You are one click away from "Casablanca."

663
00:31:52,865 --> 00:31:53,685
Start it up.

664
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:57,181
No, whoa. We need to get situated. Are you all situated?

665
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,030
- I'm situated. 
- You need to, like, squish around a little.

666
00:31:59,188 --> 00:32:00,581
- I don't need to. 
- Come on, squish around a little bit.

667
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:01,758
I'm fine how I am.

668
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,949
Okay, but, you can't squish during the movie

669
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:07,063
because it's distracting. That's rule number one.

670
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:08,231
There's rules?

671
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:11,480
Oh, yeah, especially for a true classic like "Casablanca."

672
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:13,755
It's not like we're watching a there's-nothing-else-on movie

673
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:16,541
or a guilty pleasure like "Hardbodies." Oh, my God. Have you seen "Hardbodies"?

674
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,356
I don't think so.

675
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,119
Three middle-aged guys rent a beach house and they hire this young local stud

676
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:23,893
to introduce them to cute girls, a.k.a. "Hardbodies."

677
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:26,822
- Let's see that. 
- No, Luke, we're seeing "Casablanca."

678
00:32:27,523 --> 00:32:29,054
- Then let's see that. 
- Okay, the rest of the rules -

679
00:32:29,177 --> 00:32:31,552
no talking during the movie. No exceptions during a true classic.

680
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:35,249
And minimize distraction. You know, no shifting around a lot,

681
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,635
no phone calls, nothing. No going to the bathroom.

682
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:40,308
If you go, you miss the movie 'cause we're not pausing the movie.

683
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:42,162
That's the only way to get the flow of the thing, okay?

684
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,712
- Fair enough. 
- Okay.

685
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:46,652
Here we go.

686
00:32:50,005 --> 00:32:50,711
What's that?

687
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:54,199
Okay... A, no talking during the movie,

688
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:58,606
and B, don't tell me you've never seen the FBI warning before.

689
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,482
It's new to me.

690
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:02,535
Oh, my God. You're beyond monk. You're uber-monk.

691
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:04,285
Just start it up. I won't talk again.

692
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,842
Okay, just one more warning -

693
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:09,339
when they showed the first motion picture over a hundred years ago,

694
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:12,775
it featured a train rushing toward the camera,

695
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:17,177
and people were so sure the train was going to burst off the screen

696
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:20,459
and crush them that they ran away in terror.

697
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:25,426
Now, Luke, the train is not going to leave the screen.

698
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,527
- Hit the button. 
- Okay.

699
00:33:37,904 --> 00:33:39,936
Hang onto this. We'll page you when the table's ready.

700
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:40,561
Thank you.

701
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:44,928
A riot of color. Geeky but cool. Ever been to Italy?

702
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:49,951
No. Yes. What am I saying? Yes. I was just there. Duh.

703
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:50,862
Hard thing to forget.

704
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:55,512
Yeah. I'm just so used to not having been anywhere, but yeah, I have.

705
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:56,444
And what's it like?

706
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:58,055
Terrific.

707
00:34:03,064 --> 00:34:04,506
Boy, they have these places all over.

708
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:08,327
Two in Miami, Detroit. Hey, two in my hometown.

709
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,313
- Now, that's a great town. 
- Definitely.

710
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:11,578
So you've been there?

711
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:13,831
- Where? 
- Chicago.

712
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:16,723
- Is that were you're from? 
- Oh, I thought you saw where I was pointing.

713
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:17,953
Oh, no.

714
00:34:20,823 --> 00:34:23,472
You know, I miss things about home that I didn't think I'd miss.

715
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:26,339
Like my little brother Brian. He drove me crazy my whole life,

716
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:29,278
and now I can't wait for his e-mails. You have any siblings?

717
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:30,845
No.

718
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,122
You know, I read this article once about restaurants like this

719
00:34:40,255 --> 00:34:43,036
where they have an open bowl of mints that you grab on your way out.

720
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:46,150
And when people come out of the bathroom, a lot of them don't wash their hands.

721
00:34:46,282 --> 00:34:49,927
They'll grab a mint and walk out, and people have studied the mints

722
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:52,794
and they found traces of urine in them, so they're urine mints.

723
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:59,594
- Hey, we're being paged. 
- Good.

724
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:01,526
Right this way.

725
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:16,762
- Thank you. 
- Enjoy.

726
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:23,510
- Stop doing that. 
- Shh, no talking.

727
00:35:23,684 --> 00:35:25,168
- Then stop doing that. 
- Doing what?

728
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:26,055
Looking at me.

729
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,694
Vain party, table for one.

730
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,541
You know what I mean. You're watching me watch the movie. It's creepy.

731
00:35:33,513 --> 00:35:36,145
I enjoy watching people watch certain parts of certain movies.

732
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:38,035
But you look over just before something big happens,

733
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:39,341
so I always know something's coming.

734
00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:40,125
Oh, I do?

735
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:42,772
You did it just before Humphrey Bogart saw Ingrid Bergman for the first time.

736
00:35:43,037 --> 00:35:45,295
Well, she's the costar. You knew something was coming.

737
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:49,484
- There goes our flow. 
- Well, we missed stuff while we were talking.

738
00:35:50,058 --> 00:35:52,000
- Hi, it's Lorelai. Leave me a message. 
- You're back too far, we've seen this.

739
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:54,620
- I didn't. I was looking at you. 
- We'll never get through this.

740
00:35:54,697 --> 00:35:55,550
Mom, are you there?

741
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:58,342
- Oh, wait, wait. 
- Come on.

742
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,749
Mom, if you're there, pick up.

743
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:04,987
- Honey, are you okay? 
- There goes the phone rule.

744
00:36:05,142 --> 00:36:07,860
- No, this whole night is sucking. 
- What? How?

745
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,680
You're right - I've never dated before, and I know that now

746
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:13,517
because of this feeling I have. I've never had this feeling before.

747
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:15,437
Sort of frozen, sort of unsure,

748
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:18,069
sort of wishing you'd read a lot of dating articles in preparation?

749
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,993
I have no idea what I'm doing here, and everyone is staring at me

750
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,055
- because they know we're on a bad first date. 
- Oh, so the guy's a dud?

751
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,493
Trevor's fine. I'm moronic.

752
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:28,663
I bring the conversation to a crashing halt every time I speak.

753
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:29,856
Well, where is he now?

754
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,004
In the bathroom, probably pondering my brilliant anecdote about urine mints.

755
00:36:33,178 --> 00:36:34,218
About what?

756
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,364
You know, when people go to the bathroom and they don't wash their hands

757
00:36:36,497 --> 00:36:37,812
and they come out and they take a mint.

758
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,999
Oh, my God. I've been eating those mints for years.

759
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:43,245
- Hey, did you know about urine mints? 
- What?

760
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:45,298
And I've already forgotten everything that he said to me -

761
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:47,397
the name of his brother and sister and best friend.

762
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:49,814
And we're sitting on the same side of the table.

763
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:53,756
We keep bumping menus, and my neck already hurts from trying to turn

764
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:56,618
and look at him when he talks. Can I tell him to sit on the other side?

765
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:59,500
Honey, you just...you have to relax, 'cause it's just a date,

766
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:00,878
and sometimes dates don't go well.

767
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,480
I mean, I'm sorry I can't be of more help, but if he comes back

768
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:05,168
and you're on the phone, it might make things more awkward.

769
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:07,708
- Bite the bullet, huh? 
- Yeah. Sorry, but yeah.

770
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,754
- Okay. I'll talk to you later. 
- Bye.

771
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,603
- Oh, poor thing. 
- Dating's the worst.

772
00:37:15,808 --> 00:37:17,978
Yeah, but they're sitting on the same side of the table

773
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,332
and that's awkward, and she can't think of what to say next,

774
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:25,854
and you know, she's just gotta go through it and figure it out on her own.

775
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:29,029
You just have to throw them out there and let them learn what those wings are for.

776
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,759
She could say there's a draft.

777
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:33,391
- What? 
- Where she's sitting.

778
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:36,012
She could say the air conditioning is hitting her, switch to the other side,

779
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,586
- and just blame it on that. 
- That's perfect.

780
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:43,913
- Mom? 
- Hey. Is he back yet?

781
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,471
Say there's a draft and move to the other side of the table.

782
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,301
It's very ladylike to feel drafts. He'll totally understand.

783
00:37:50,574 --> 00:37:51,444
Okay, good.

784
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,851
And then ask what his brother and sister's names are.

785
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:56,221
- He'll like that you cared enough to confirm. 
- Yeah, that seems right.

786
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:00,101
Don't worry about the conversation. Just talk, and if the talk doesn't flow, it doesn't.

787
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,928
And stay away from urine-related topics, and you're good to go.

788
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:05,455
- Thanks, Mom. 
- Oh, the draft thing was Luke's.

789
00:38:05,622 --> 00:38:07,501
- Well, thank him for me, too. I'd better go. 
- Go, go.

790
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:10,568
Oh, good. I feel so much better. She says thanks.

791
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:12,666
I wouldn't trade places with her for the world.

792
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:15,258
Really? You wouldn't want to go out with a boy named Trevor?

793
00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:18,320
- You might want to wait and see his picture. 
- I mean dating. It's a horror.

794
00:38:18,473 --> 00:38:21,867
It's the only cure for the singleness thing, barring ordering a spouse off the internet.

795
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:24,821
- I missed nothing by not dating. 
- Not true.

796
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,938
If I had dated a lot, I'd still be single.

797
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,511
I'd just have spent a lot of bad nights at Tony Roma's.

798
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:32,614
Yeah, but dating is how you get to know your potential partner. It's the only way.

799
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:37,581
There's the gut. I can tell if I'm comfortable with someone within seconds of meeting them.

800
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:40,632
I feel it here. I felt it with Rachel. I felt it with Nicole.

801
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:43,750
- I was immediately relaxed. 
- You've got the gut thing.

802
00:38:43,873 --> 00:38:46,414
Well, it's just knowing that someone will let you be.

803
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,383
- That's a gut thing. 
- Aah! You're fast-forwarding.

804
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,773
We'll not gonna get through this thing. I just wanna get to the good parts.

805
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,530
There are no bad parts of "Casablanca."

806
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,414
Just go back. Back.

807
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:57,143
I'm gonna go grab dessert.

808
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:01,184
Hey, phone again.

809
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,193
- Hello? 
- Who is this?

810
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,460
- Who's this? 
- This is Emily Gilmore.

811
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,310
- Who's this? 
- Luke Danes, Mrs. Gilmore.

812
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,483
Your daughter's friend from the diner.

813
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,891
I'm not really supposed to be talking to you here. Hang on.

814
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:20,911
- Why did you answer the phone? 
- You answered it before.

815
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:23,243
Yeah, but that was Rory. You should have told her I'm not here.

816
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:25,264
- Then what would I be doing here? 
- Light maintenance.

817
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:26,979
- Come on, take it. 
- You broke a rule.

818
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:28,101
You've broken every rule.

819
00:39:28,222 --> 00:39:30,641
Yeah, but dodging my mother's phone calls is not a movie-night rule.

820
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:31,551
It's an always rule.

821
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:36,283
Hi, Mom. What's up?

822
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:38,212
So now you're telling people they can't speak to me?

823
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:40,972
No, Mom. It's just a little movie-night rule.

824
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,425
If you and Luke wanna talk, you guys can talk.

825
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:46,251
- I'm talking about Natalie Zimmerman. 
- Natalie?

826
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:49,880
I called her today about sprucing up a room she did for me a year ago,

827
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,631
and, as you would say, she blew me off.

828
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:53,890
Well, what did she say?

829
00:39:54,074 --> 00:39:56,394
She said she couldn't help me out, but she wouldn't say why,

830
00:39:56,569 --> 00:40:00,495
so I leaned on her a bit. She cracked and said she'd made you certain promises.

831
00:40:00,654 --> 00:40:02,922
Mom, I never told her she couldn't work for you.

832
00:40:03,163 --> 00:40:04,012
She said you did.

833
00:40:04,274 --> 00:40:07,407
- Well, no. Our agreement was... 
- So there was an agreement.

834
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:09,096
- Yes, but... 
- To exclude me?

835
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:11,115
No. Well, not exactly.

836
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:13,766
You know, Lorelai, perhaps it would be easier if you just gave me

837
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:16,172
a list of the people I'm not allowed to have contact with.

838
00:40:16,357 --> 00:40:20,442
So far I know there's Natalie and Sookie and Luke on movie night.

839
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:23,084
What about Richard? Am I still allowed to talk to my husband?

840
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:26,521
Mom, this is just a big misunderstanding. Go ahead and hire Natalie.

841
00:40:26,638 --> 00:40:28,542
But you'll still have a problem with both of us using her.

842
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:31,747
I will cease working with her. She's all yours. I'll tell her tomorrow.

843
00:40:31,892 --> 00:40:35,402
Oh, wonderful. So it'll be my fault she loses the job.

844
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:40,595
No, Lorelai, you keep her, and I promise I'll never speak to her - ever.

845
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,996
If she's bleeding on the side of the road, I'll drive by and pretend I didn't see.

846
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:45,481
- Mom... 
- I have to go.

847
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:46,786
I'm firing Natalie.

848
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:48,797
- That's up to you. 
- Consider it done.

849
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:50,594
- I'll see you Friday. 
- Yup.

850
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:01,510
I know just how you feel, Rick.

851
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,394
Mom?

852
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,060
Tell me he didn't fall asleep during "Casablanca."

853
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:17,301
No, we made it through "Casablanca." He fell asleep during "Hardbodies."

854
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:19,933
How do you fall asleep during a classic like "Hardbodies"?

855
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:22,083
There's no accounting for taste.

856
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:25,074
He looks comfy there, doesn't he?

857
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:26,507
Yeah, he does.

858
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,704
So, you wanna talk about it or you wanna forget about it?

859
00:41:31,817 --> 00:41:34,582
Well, there's nothing much to talk about. It was just bad.

860
00:41:34,837 --> 00:41:37,531
I got a little better as the night went on - talked a little more.

861
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:42,282
He was very nice, just not my type. Oh, and the whole draft thing backfired.

862
00:41:42,395 --> 00:41:42,902
How so?

863
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,482
Well, I switched over to the other side of the table.

864
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:49,077
Then he started to feel the same draft and came over to my side.

865
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:51,415
- But we made up the draft. 
- The power of suggestion.

866
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:54,371
- Boys are so malleable. 
- It just all seemed so forced.

867
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,713
I mean, I felt like I was locked into the pointless societal ritual.

868
00:41:58,108 --> 00:41:59,270
- There has to be another way. 
- Luke and I were debating that.

869
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:04,374
Luke thinks it's all about gut instinct - you know instantly if a person is right for you.

870
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:07,161
I think you have to go through a lot to find a contender.

871
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:08,866
And you've been very lucky with boys before.

872
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:12,336
They were just always sort of there, but I think for the most part,

873
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,498
- a girl's got to hunt a little. 
- And go through a lot of non-contenders.

874
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,706
Yes, then the non-contenders become your fun bad-date anecdotes.

875
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:20,826
In fact, on your next date, if you're stuck for a topic,

876
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,452
- tell him about your bad date. 
- But what if that date is bad?

877
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,617
- Then you have an anecdote for your next date. 
- And how long does this go on?

878
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:28,568
You've seen "Grey Gardens." It could go on forever.

879
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:30,763
- Oh, well, just shoot me now. 
- Hang in there.

880
00:42:30,938 --> 00:42:33,461
- Go with Luke's gut thing if all else fails. 
- Maybe.

881
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:47,946
I think my clothes were in there.

882
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,189
Oh, yeah, somebody had already dumped them out,

883
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,759
so I put 'em in my basket to keep 'em clean. Hope you don't mind.

884
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:54,371
No. Thanks.

885
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:57,341
Wow, that's the coolest laundry basket I've ever seen. I love The Smiths.

886
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,167
I had an older brother that got me into them,

887
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:02,021
and when my friends were listening to Hootie and the Blowfish,

888
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:03,629
I was memorizing "Meat is Murder."

889
00:43:03,721 --> 00:43:05,764
Well, I have a mom who's pretty much cooler than anyone you'd meet,

890
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:08,831
- and she did the same thing. 
- Mine's a plain old soccer mom, but she's great.

891
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:13,220
Well, being away like this makes you think about stuff like that, doesn't it - home?

892
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:14,145
Totally.

893
00:43:20,078 --> 00:43:22,824
Hey, would you maybe wanna get a cup of coffee sometime,

894
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,815
in between classes or something?

895
00:43:26,213 --> 00:43:28,559
I don't think so, but thanks.

896
00:43:31,149 --> 00:43:31,886
You're welcome.
