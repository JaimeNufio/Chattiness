1
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:03,075
Hello?
Gilmore residence.

2
00:00:03,084 --> 00:00:04,476
Hey, mom, it's me.

3
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:05,801
I just wanted to
leave you a message

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,576
letting you know that unfortunately,
I will not be able to come by tonight

5
00:00:08,605 --> 00:00:10,257
to take a look at
your new curtains.

6
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:11,574
Lorelai, it's me.

7
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:14,275
- So, sorry I missed you, but --
- You didn't miss me.

8
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:15,669
For heaven's sakes,
I'm right here.

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,064
- Hello?
- Hello? Lorelai?

10
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:18,315
- Hello?
- Hello?

11
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:19,959
Huh. That's weird.

12
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:21,906
I don't know if your
machine just cut me off.

13
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:23,313
Is something wrong
with this phone?

14
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,125
Anyway, uh, something came up,

15
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:27,802
and I just have to take a rain
check on the curtain check.

16
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,344
I'm sure they're beautiful.

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,179
No one knows how to pick
out curtains like you.

18
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,234
You're the curtain queen.

19
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:34,235
Hello? Lorelai,
can you hear me?

20
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:36,348
Anyway, have a good night,
curtain queen.

21
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,092
Give my best to dad. Bye.

22
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,680
Lorelai? Hello? Hello?

23
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:42,697
See? I told you it would work.

24
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,527
Wow. How did you
even think to --

25
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,500
Well, it's natural instincts
honed by years of experience.

26
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,381
Wow.

27
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:50,320
Yeah. Fight or flight, you know.
Fight or flight.

28
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:51,395
And I just did my nails, so...

29
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:52,901
- Flight.
- Flight.

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,615
Wow.

31
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:55,429
Où est la station de
métro la plus proche ?

32
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:58,357
"Where is the nearest
subway station?"

33
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,430
Yeah.

34
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:02,468
Ou est-ce que je peux
acheter un billet ?

35
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:06,058
- "Where can I buy a ticket?"
- The hunter and gatherer has returned.

36
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:07,995
Hey. Listen to how
good I've gotten.

37
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,064
Pouvez-vous me donner un plan de métro,
s'il vous plaît ?

38
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:14,063
"Could I have a map of
the subway, please?"

39
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:17,633
Could I have a map of
the subway, please?

40
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:18,823
- Impressive.
- Right?

41
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:20,558
I'm practically fluent.

42
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,907
Thank you for the
coffee and croissant.

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,375
De rien.

44
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:25,814
"You're welcome."

45
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:27,272
Duh.

46
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:29,918
I thought our stomachs should
start adjusting to french cuisine,

47
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,344
so I got croissants
and café au lait.

48
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:33,761
I thought café au
lait was spanish.

49
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:36,122
No, it's french for "coffee
and milk." "Lait" is "milk."

50
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:41,098
Really? I thought it was "café
olé," like, "coffee! All right!"

51
00:02:41,114 --> 00:02:42,556
You're kidding.

52
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:44,838
You're not kidding.
You are. You're kidding.

53
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:45,942
I can't tell whether
you're kidding.

54
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:47,351
I'm a woman of mystery.

55
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,368
You know, you might want to try
repeating some of those words in french.

56
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,067
No.

57
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:51,466
We leave for Paris
in two weeks.

58
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,134
Yes, but I don't have to
actually speak french.

59
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,528
I just have to sound french.

60
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,193
That way, if the parisians find
me just another uncouth american,

61
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:58,965
I can tell them my sad story.

62
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,067
"I was born in Marseille,

63
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:05,113
"and my parents were killed
in a très tragique accident.

64
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,714
"And so I was sent
to the states

65
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:10,035
"and adopted by
the evil Gilmores,

66
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:12,441
"who refused to let
me speak french,

67
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:16,594
"but I never forgot the
accent of my mother country."

68
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,185
That's a complicated backstory.

69
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,065
I've led a complicated life.

70
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:22,665
- Somebody gets a lot of mail.
- Yeah, well, I'm a popular gal.

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,541
Also, my system is,
I only open my mail once a month.

72
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:28,228
Your system is to open
your mail once a month?

73
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,454
12 times a year, you know,

74
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:31,669
because if you open your
mail more than that,

75
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:34,689
you get a lot of mattress fliers
and bills and another bill.

76
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:36,754
This  way,
I open it once a month,

77
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,950
and I get letters from people
who still write letters

78
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:41,943
and shampoo samples
and fun stuff.

79
00:03:41,957 --> 00:03:43,541
It's fun.

80
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,038
Hey, what's this?

81
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:46,717
Something from Yale?

82
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,538
About the parents' weekend.
We should go.

83
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:49,997
- Nah.
- Why no?

84
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,139
I'm sure it already happened.

85
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:53,266
No, it's happening this weekend.
Come on. Could be fun.

86
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:55,136
I got to wash my hair.

87
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,500
Why don't you want to go?

88
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:57,583
Because -- my hair.

89
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,344
Looks great when it's dirty. The oil
gives it a kinf of sheen and gloss.

90
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:02,466
Parents' weekend is for lame-o
parents whose kids hate them,

91
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,457
so they need a school-sanctioned
event so they all spend time together.

92
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,361
A professor of geology is giving
a tour of the Peabody Museum.

93
00:04:08,377 --> 00:04:09,706
My kid likes me.

94
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,593
I can go to Yale
any time I want.

95
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:14,156
51 weekends of the year
is my parents' weekend.

96
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,197
"The gemstones of Yale."
How cool does that sound?

97
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:18,748
On a scale of 1 to 2?

98
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:22,287
Listen, parents' weekend is not an
accurate portrait of the school, anyway.

99
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:24,954
They make special food.
They gussy the place up.

100
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:27,677
They plant kids under
trees reading Tolstoy,

101
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,818
so it all looks very
collegiate and idyllic.

102
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:31,965
There's a brunch at
Branford with the provost.

103
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,501
You know,
I've always loved the word "provost."

104
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,428
Although I have no idea
who or what a provost is,

105
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,097
- it just sounds so...
- Idyllic and collegiate?

106
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:38,878
Yes, or something
from a deli counter.

107
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:40,557
"Extra provost on
that, please."

108
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:41,678
Do you really want to go?

109
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:43,330
It's parents' weekend,
we're Rory's parents,

110
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:45,639
and we're together,
and why not?

111
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,990
Come on, I'll help you shampoo
your hair the night before.

112
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:48,960
All right.

113
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:51,126
But I have to work on sunday,
so we'll have to go saturday,

114
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,468
and you'll have to give
me a nice head massage

115
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,653
- when you wash my hair.
- With shampoo samples.

116
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:56,748
- And blow it out.
- Done.

117
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,473
- And braid it.
- I'll french-braid it.

118
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:00,082
Ooh là là. Hello?

119
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,808
- Mom?
- Bonjour, Rory.

120
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:03,928
Well, if it isn't the
orphan from Marseille.

121
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:05,619
C'est moi. What are you doing?

122
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,133
- Heading to class.
- Class?

123
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:09,406
Yes, class, where they teach
you all the college learnin'.

124
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,406
You're a senior. I thought no
seniors went to class before noon.

125
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,827
Nerd alert! Nerd alert!

126
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:15,314
Says  the woman
saying "nerd alert!"

127
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,173
Hey, guess who's coming
to parents' weekend.

128
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:18,766
Bunch of lame parents
whose kids hate 'em.

129
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,865
- Yes, and your parents.
- No way!

130
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,512
I got to keep you on your toes.
When you think I'll zig, I'll zag.

131
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:25,785
Then, when you think I'm gonna zag,
I do zag,

132
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,962
just to mess you up for the next time,
when might zig.

133
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:29,046
Dad's making you zag?

134
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,580
He's  dying to meet the provost.

135
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:31,915
Well, who isn't?

136
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:33,862
It's your mom who's
all about the provost.

137
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:35,903
I just wanted to see you and,
you know, check it out.

138
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,514
And I wouldn't mind seeing
the gemstones of Yale.

139
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:39,854
- The huh?
- The gemstones. The Yale gemstones.

140
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,594
Oh, right.

141
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:42,254
So is it cool if we come?
It's only for saturday.

142
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:44,860
Yeah, it'd be great. I mean,
saturday's gonna be pretty busy for me

143
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,219
'cause we have to put out a parents'
weekend edition of the paper,

144
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,489
but I could
definitely do lunch.

145
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,081
- She can do lunch.
- All right, then we'll do lunch.

146
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:51,900
I'll have extra
provost with mine.

147
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,962
Hey, after lunch,
can we walk Hunky Dan?

148
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:54,922
You mean, Handsome Dan?

149
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:56,544
That's his official
mascot name.

150
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,460
"Hunky Dan" is what I call
him when we're alone.

151
00:05:58,475 --> 00:05:59,437
Mom, I got to go.

152
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:01,145
You know who'd make a great mascot?
Paul Anka.

153
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:01,844
Mom--

154
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,880
I'm not sure he's the Ivy League type,
though. He might need more

155
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:06,668
of a hacky-sacking, poetry-reading,
tie-dyeing kind of place --

156
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:08,586
- Mom!
- Like Reed or Oberlin,

157
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:10,851
where the air is sweet with
the scent of patchouli.

158
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:13,036
Mom, I'm not missing the
beginning of this lecture.

159
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,328
Nerd alert!
Nerd alert! Nerd alert!

160
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:18,717
- What kind of sandwich is that, Luke?
- Ham and cheese.

161
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,268
- Is it stinky cheese?
- Cheddar.

162
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:22,887
Because you really don't want to pack
April a lunch with stinky cheese.

163
00:06:22,922 --> 00:06:24,326
By lunchtime,
the whole bag will smell,

164
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,040
and people won't believe it when
she says it's just the cheese.

165
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,738
They'll think it's her.
They'll think she's stinky.

166
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:29,801
Eat your breakfast, Kirk.

167
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:31,250
- Muffin?
- Yes, muffin?

168
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,555
No, I'm offering.

169
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:34,366
- Is it bran?
- It's banana.

170
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:35,758
It could be banana-bran.

171
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:37,522
- It's just banana.
- Okay.

172
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:39,039
- Butter?
- Not too much.

173
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,225
- 1 1/2 pats.
- Two pats is too much.

174
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:43,171
- 1 1/2.
- April, your ride's here.

175
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:44,677
I'm coming!

176
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:47,034
- Got everything?
- Yeah.

177
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,052
- Protractor?
- I got it.

178
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,202
- Biology homework?
- Yep.

179
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:51,295
- Extra sweater?
- Green cardigan in my locker.

180
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,724
- Good, good.
- Bye, dad.

181
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:54,612
- Wait, what about your swimsuit?
- I got it.

182
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,185
You sure you don't need
a ride to swim practice?

183
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:58,151
Megan's mom is taking me.
I told you.

184
00:06:58,165 --> 00:06:59,954
She's coming!
All right, so, look --

185
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:02,561
I'll pick you up at 5:00,
and I'll be there right after work.

186
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:03,859
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

187
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,833
All right, already!
She's standing right here! Go!

188
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,185
All right. Bye.

189
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,843
I should go, too.

190
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:11,309
Have a good day, baby.

191
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:12,287
You too.

192
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:14,341
- Bye, Luke.
- Bye, Lulu.

193
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:22,012
Could someone crack a window?
Because I am suffocating.

194
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,768
- What?
- Tell me you didn't see that.

195
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,823
See what, Kirk?

196
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:26,549
Lulu! She's smothering me!

197
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:27,729
Smothering you?

198
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,415
Everywhere I go, there she is.

199
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,148
I'm sitting at the movies.
Who's sitting next to me? Lulu.

200
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:35,006
I go out to dinner.
Who's sitting across from me? Lulu.

201
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,981
I'm hanging out on the couch,
watching TV.

202
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:38,373
Who's right there next to me?

203
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:40,081
- Your mother.
- And Lulu.

204
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:42,411
And at least mother
respects my personal space.

205
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,695
Sometimes when you're
watching "Antiques Roadshow,"

206
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:47,782
you just don't want
somebody tickling your arm.

207
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:54,782
Bye again.

208
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,111
You're pitiful.

209
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,423
I'm just telling you how it is.

210
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:05,842
You don't tell me how it is.
I tell you how it is.

211
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:07,471
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

212
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:09,878
You think you do, but you don't.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

213
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,005
You're telling me that
you tell me how it is?

214
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:13,168
That's what I'm telling you.

215
00:08:13,181 --> 00:08:15,106
- We'll just see about that. Lorelai?
- Busy.

216
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,052
- We have a question.
- Busy, busy bee.

217
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,046
Sookie's under the mistaken
impression that she will be

218
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,617
in charge of the front desk
while you are in Paris.

219
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:23,907
I informed her that
that job falls to me.

220
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,740
Could you please
clear this up for her?

221
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,790
Did I not mention how busy I am?
Busy, like a bee. Bzzz!

222
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:30,064
Lorelai!

223
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:33,510
Michel, while I am away,
you're in charge of the front desk.

224
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,763
However, Sookie is a
co-owner of the Inn,

225
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:38,083
so she is in charge in charge.

226
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:40,971
That is preposterous.
She does not know the first thing

227
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:42,773
about running the front desk.

228
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,084
All I have to know is how
to tell your sorry behind

229
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:47,118
to stand at the front
desk and be courteous

230
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:49,669
and to check those nice
people in and out.

231
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:52,057
- Sorry.
- Absurd.

232
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,243
That's right --
back to your station!

233
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:56,094
Really? Was that
really necessary?

234
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:57,292
- What?
- To provoke him like that.

235
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:58,654
You know how sensitive he is.

236
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,651
Well, I'm sorry.
He's been driving me crazy.

237
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:02,586
He keeps referring to
himself as my supervisor

238
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,359
and insisting that I
call him "captain."

239
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,038
Well now I have to deal all
day with sulky, pouty Michel.

240
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,179
He's a big baby.

241
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:10,372
He should come to work wearing
a diaper and carrying a rattle.

242
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:12,790
Maybe while I'm gone,
you can get him to do that.

243
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:15,264
Hello?

244
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,301
Oh, hi.

245
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:17,989
- Are you Sookie St. James?
- That's me.

246
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:20,232
I'm Harvey Tuttle.
I just took over the Tillman farm.

247
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:23,015
Oh, yeah. Congratulations.
Beautiful property.

248
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,384
Thank you. I still can't
quite believe it's all mine.

249
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,859
Anyhow, this is my first crop,

250
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:29,431
and I'm offering free samples
to all the local restaurants.

251
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:32,911
Got some eggplant, some zucchini,
some tomatoes here.

252
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,625
Oh, thank you, but I already
have a vegetable supplier.

253
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,801
Well, you know, technically,
tomatoes are a fruit.

254
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:39,175
Ah. Fair point.

255
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:41,295
Well, I have a vegetable
and fruit supplier.

256
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:42,953
- How about legumes?
- And legumes.

257
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:45,234
That's okay. Why don't you go
ahead and take this batch anyway?

258
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:47,018
- Oh, no, no, no.
- On the house.

259
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:49,205
If you like it and feel like
passing my name along to someone,

260
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:50,721
I'd greatly appreciate it.

261
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:53,271
- Okay. I will do that.
- Thank you.

262
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,461
It was nice meeting
you, Sookie.

263
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,333
Nice to meet you, too.

264
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:02,190
Come on! Everybody should be
in the locker room!

265
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:04,108
Allison, Haley, no running.

266
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:05,691
My towel's all wet.

267
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:07,600
That's what happens when you
throw it in the pool, Laura.

268
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,201
It's a terrific lesson
in cause and effect.

269
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,936
Now, squeeze it out
and go get changed.

270
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:14,714
Thank you.

271
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:18,782
- Hi, there.
- Hi. I'm Luke Danes.

272
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,575
April's dad.
She talks a lot about you.

273
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:21,946
Yeah, you must be
coach Bennett.

274
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,859
-  Susan.
- Yeah.

275
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,353
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. You too.

276
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:26,079
April's in the locker room.
She should be right out.

277
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:26,886
Okay.

278
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:28,190
She's doing really great --

279
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:30,243
definitely one of our most
enthusiastic swimmers.

280
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,718
Yeah, she really
seems to love it.

281
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:33,666
Good natural technique, too.
Does she get that from you?

282
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,419
Oh, no, not me.
No, I don't really know how to swim.

283
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,856
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

284
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:39,804
I mean, I could doggy-paddle
to shore in a pinch,

285
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:41,932
but I never really
learned formally, you know.

286
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,170
Luke, that's not good.

287
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,361
I'm pretty good
on land, though.

288
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,730
You need to be certified.

289
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:48,226
You  take April to pools,
lakes, the ocean.

290
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:50,074
I never really
thought about that.

291
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,260
No worries. I teach an adult swim class
saturday mornings for 1 1/2 hour.

292
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:56,386
It's an 8-week course. And in fact,
I started new classes last week,

293
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,388
so if you came this saturday, you'll
really not have missed much at all.

294
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,142
Oh, I-I don't know.

295
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:03,340
Luke, this is not
something I would wait on.

296
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:06,322
Well, I -- Yeah, okay.
I guess I could do that.

297
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:07,243
Great.

298
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:09,293
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

299
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:10,617
Oh, this is coach Bennett.

300
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:11,625
Yeah, we were just meeting.

301
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,629
Well, did she tell you I'm gonna
swim the 100-meter butterfly

302
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:16,305
and the 4x100-meter freestyle
at our meet next week?

303
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,618
No, but that's great!

304
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,749
I mean, I'm not anchor or anything,
but I'm still pretty fast.

305
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:21,311
And getting faster
all the time.

306
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:24,207
And hey, your dad's gonna
take a swim class with me.

307
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:26,048
Really? You are?

308
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:26,980
Well, yeah.

309
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:28,592
Do you even own a bathing suit?

310
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,515
Yeah, I do.
I mean, it's not a Speedo or anything.

311
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:36,934
That  is the funniest
thing I have ever --

312
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:39,053
can we call mom and
tell her from the car?

313
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:40,606
Yeah.

314
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:45,713
Grass is just not this green -- not
outside of "Pleasantville," it isn't.

315
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:47,075
So, what exactly
are you saying?

316
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,329
I'm suggesting they
brought in sod.

317
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,911
- You suspect sod.
- Yes, yes, or spray paint.

318
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:54,278
Maybe they spray-painted the grass
when they spray-painted these trees

319
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:57,682
'cause there's autumnal foliage
and then there's autumnal foliage.

320
00:11:57,695 --> 00:11:59,113
It's over the top, people.

321
00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:02,476
You're onto them. Hey, you think
Yale piped in this crisp fall smell?

322
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:05,872
Uh, yeah, because Yale is crafty,
Yale is smart.

323
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:07,428
Yale is Yale, after all.

324
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,845
Have fun, you two!
Go, Bulldogs!

325
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:10,695
Hello.

326
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:11,683
Hi!

327
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,893
Let me ask you something.

328
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:16,433
Do you really go here,
or are you an actress hired by Yale?

329
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:19,022
What? I go here. I go here.

330
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:20,365
You're good.
I almost believe you.

331
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,161
I'm sorry?

332
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,223
Hi. We're Rory
Gilmore's parents.

333
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:27,184
Well, Rory Gilmore's parents,
welcome to parents' weekend.

334
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,370
- Here's a parents' packet.
- Fabulous.

335
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:32,219
Inside, you should find a map
of the campus. You are here.

336
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:32,994
So we are.

337
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:35,544
A schedule of the weekend's
events and a nametag.

338
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,312
Thanks. Great.
Go, Bulldogs.

339
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,630
I was just gonna say that.
Have fun, you two.

340
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:40,732
- Okay.
- Thank you.

341
00:12:40,747 --> 00:12:42,546
Hey, let's be
Laverne and Shirley.

342
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,439
What? No.

343
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,317
Antony and Cleopatra?
F. Scott and Zelda?

344
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,506
Zinf and Del?

345
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,769
I think I'll stick
with my own name.

346
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:51,591
Pbht! Señor boring pants?
Mr. Stick-in-the-mud?

347
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:54,277
"A cappella," "a
cappella." Hmm-hmm.

348
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,394
There's a terrifying number of
a-cappella jams this weekend.

349
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:58,334
What exactly is an
a-cappella jam?

350
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,007
I don't know,
but it sure sounds painful.

351
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:02,293
Hey. We're here.

352
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:05,172
Hey. See if you can get that
editorial to fit on one page.

353
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:06,102
So, you're here.

354
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:07,731
With bells on,
and nothing else,

355
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,722
except leg warmers, roller skates,
and Groucho Marx glasses.

356
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:12,486
- How classy.
- Hi, Rory!

357
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:14,675
Well, we're your parents.
We're supposed to embarrass you.

358
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,740
Are you at the paper?

359
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,638
Yes, I am, indeed.
Where are you guys?

360
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:20,889
We are near a big brick
building and a big tree.

361
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,338
- Are you near there?
- Possibly.

362
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,570
We have a lot of brick buildings
and old trees here at Yale.

363
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,760
Tell her we're by the L-shaped
building that from the top

364
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:28,264
looks like a polaroid camera.

365
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,346
Believe it or not,
I don't know what Yale's buildings

366
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,371
look like from the sky.

367
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:32,828
How ignorant of you, honey.

368
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:35,543
Rory says she doesn't give two
figs about Yale architecture.

369
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:37,002
Not two figs?

370
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,382
1 1/2 figs is all I'll give.

371
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:39,486
So how are things at the paper?

372
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,690
Busy but good.
I should be done by lunch.

373
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:44,242
We got this schedule of events.
Any recommendations?

374
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:45,440
Brunch with the provost!

375
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:46,688
I might like to
tour the Peabody

376
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:48,701
or maybe catch one of
the faculty lectures --

377
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:51,097
There's one called "Plagues and
pleasures" with professor Summers.

378
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:54,054
Summers is good. He's a bigwig in
the world of molecular biophysics.

379
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:54,916
Sounds hard.

380
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,171
I doubt there'll be an exam.

381
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:59,135
How about "the extravagant
universe" with professor Quincy?

382
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,475
Hey, what is with
all the a cappella?

383
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,757
There's a cappella, a cappella,
morning, noon, and night.

384
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,397
I'm not sure I can take
that much a cappella.

385
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:08,439
Then you should avoid arches. A-cappella
groups tend to hang out under arches.

386
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:10,568
Arches and any other places
with good acoustics.

387
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,498
Thanks for the tip.

388
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:13,731
If you hear a pitch pipe, run.
I got to get back to work.

389
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:15,679
Okay, we're gonna have
brunch with the provost...

390
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:17,702
or on the provost --
it's still unclear.

391
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:19,584
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

392
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,770
Hey.

393
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,439
What is with your nametag?

394
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:23,187
What do you mean?

395
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:24,513
It's in the middle
of your chest.

396
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:25,175
So?

397
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:27,159
So, you're supposed to
wear it off to the side.

398
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,560
Who wears a nametag in
the middle of their chest?

399
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:29,929
- Superman.
- Superman's "S"?

400
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:31,302
That was not a nametag.
That was an emblem.

401
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,770
So, this is my emblem.

402
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,491
"Hello, I'm Rory Gilmore's dad,
Christopher" is your emblem?

403
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,036
Yes.
Yes, it is.

404
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,540
I'm gonna have to ask you to
walk 15 feet in front of me.

405
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:44,084
And breathe in. And blow.

406
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:48,861
And breathe in. And blow.

407
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:50,417
Good, Luke.

408
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,104
But try not to take
such shallow breaths.

409
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:55,469
Try to take slower,
deeper breaths from your diaphragm.

410
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:57,398
- Feel that?
- Yeah.

411
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,081
I'm having a little trouble
getting deep breaths over here.

412
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,867
You're doing fine, Ronald.

413
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,474
Now you stopped
breathing altogether.

414
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,728
- Just try and relax.
- Okay.

415
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:09,528
It's okay.
You'll get the hang of it.

416
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:12,244
All right, everybody.
That's it. Good work.

417
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:14,056
You did good today.

418
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:15,399
- Yeah? Thanks.
- Yeah.

419
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,077
You caught right up.

420
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,062
I'll have you swimming
like a fish in no time.

421
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:20,262
Oh, good. Thank you.

422
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,284
So... you eat?

423
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:23,751
- Eat?
- Food.

424
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:26,071
I was thinking you could call me,
and we could get a bite to eat.

425
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:27,838
Uh, yeah, sure, sure.

426
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:30,224
Here. Here's the Young
Dolphins' contact sheet.

427
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:31,634
My number's right at the top.

428
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,755
Okay. Great. Thanks.

429
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,577
- See you soon.
- Bye.

430
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:38,368
Look at this propaganda.

431
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:40,410
Belgian waffles, cloth napkins.

432
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:41,754
I've had breakfast here before,

433
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:44,562
and it was paper napkins and
american cereal all the way.

434
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,866
Yeah --
lox, capers, itty-bitty bagels?

435
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,148
Pack of lies.

436
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:48,956
Coffee?

437
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,478
Uh, coffee.

438
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:51,332
Coffee.

439
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:52,751
I'm Lou, Ethan Morton's dad.

440
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:53,492
Cheers.

441
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,236
I'm Christopher. This is Lorelai.
We're Rory Gilmore's parents.

442
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,595
Rory Gilmore? Sure.
She's a senior, right?

443
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:01,097
Wow. Did you memorize
the student facebook?

444
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:02,899
The masthead of the
Yale Daily News.

445
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:06,044
Ethan's an aspiring journalist
and a big fan of your daughter's.

446
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:07,818
I love that Rory has fans.

447
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:10,524
Maybe we should set up a lunch or
something so Rory could meet Ethan.

448
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,277
Lou, honestly.

449
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,072
I apologize on behalf
of my husband,

450
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:16,900
who can't seem to remember that
Ethan already got into Yale.

451
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,748
The pressure's off. He doesn't
need his booster club anymore.

452
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:20,537
Daisy.

453
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,144
Hi. Lorelai and Christopher.
We're Rory Gilmore's parents.

454
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:25,723
Oh, Rory Gilmore's parents.

455
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:27,605
Oh! Where did you get the
darling little bagels?

456
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:29,283
Oh, they're right over here.
I'll show you.

457
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:32,237
You know, Ethan really is an
incredible journalist.

458
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:34,385
He wrote this editorial
for his high-school paper

459
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:37,089
arguing that it should be legal
to burn the american flag.

460
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:38,287
Insightful as hell.

461
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,207
I'd be glad to e-mail you a copy,
if you want.

462
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:41,492
Where is the provost?

463
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:43,179
Aren't you dying to
meet the provost?

464
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:44,482
Sorry if I was
being a bit pushy.

465
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:46,144
No. Please. You're a proud dad.

466
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:47,915
Yeah. And we should
be proud, right?

467
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:49,998
- Our kids done good.
- Yeah.

468
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:52,617
It's just hard to let go,
you know, after all those years

469
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:54,948
of looking over their homework
and reading their papers,

470
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,036
practicing lines with
them for the school play,

471
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,693
taking them to karate lessons,
violin lessons,

472
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,287
S.A.T.-prep courses.

473
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:02,945
What about 5:00 a.m.
hockey practice?

474
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,249
Science projects.

475
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:06,627
I helped Owen build a
wave generator one year.

476
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:07,758
$3,200.

477
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,455
That's what it cost me to
replace the kitchen tiles

478
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:11,489
when the thing exploded in
the middle of the night.

479
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:13,755
- It exploded?
- I sell ladies' shoes.

480
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:15,892
What do I know about
wave generators?

481
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:17,274
Jake -- Owen Huber's dad.

482
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,219
- I'm Christopher. I'm...
- Rory Gilmore's dad.

483
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,062
I was just talking
to your wife.

484
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:22,978
Um, actually, I'm not his wife.

485
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:25,510
I didn't say that you were. I was
talking about his wife -- Mrs. Gilmore.

486
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,649
She's over there
by the mimosas.

487
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:31,111
Unbelievable.

488
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:33,041
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

489
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:35,255
I'm gonna go talk
to Mrs. Gilmore.

490
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,107
Which lectures are
you guys gonna hit?

491
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:39,793
And I said to him,
"they've tenured Bill Sunderland?

492
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,960
Who's next -- Carmen Electra?"

493
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:44,261
Good one, mom.

494
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:46,851
Lorelai. If you'll excuse us?

495
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,050
- Lorelai.
- Hi.

496
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:50,157
Well. My goodness.
What on earth are you doing here?

497
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:52,931
What am I doing here? I think the
question is, what are you doing here?

498
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:54,379
It's Yale parents' weekend.

499
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:55,911
Yes, but you are not a parent.

500
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:57,055
I still can't
believe you're here.

501
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,136
Mother, it's parents' weekend.
I'm a parent.

502
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:00,834
That's why I'm here.
I'm a parent.

503
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:01,867
And I'm a grandparent.

504
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:03,268
Right. A grandparent,
not a parent.

505
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,293
- A grandparent is a type of parent.
- No, it's not.

506
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:07,314
A grand piano is a type of piano,
is it not?

507
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,175
Well, you got me there, Riddler,
but I hope that logic works

508
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:11,920
when I crash
grandparents' weekend.

509
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:14,328
Oh, please, Lorelai.
Your father and I have been attending

510
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,109
Rory's parents' weekends here at
Yale since her freshman year.

511
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:18,450
It's one of our
little traditions.

512
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,913
Hello, Rachel.
I'll see you at the field-hockey game?

513
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,254
It's one of your little traditions
to pretend to be Rory's parents?

514
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:25,760
Lorelai. What a surprise.

515
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:28,291
Yes, it is a surprise. You know why?
'Cause you guys aren't parents.

516
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:30,619
- Why are you here?
- I'm an alumnus, Lorelai.

517
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:32,240
Also a visiting faculty member.

518
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:33,793
And you'll remember,
until recently,

519
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:37,064
your father and I were the ones taking
responsibility for Rory's tuition.

520
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,254
Yes, I remember.

521
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,462
We felt someone ought to attend,
for Rory's sake.

522
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:41,958
It's obviously not
your kind of thing.

523
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,617
What is that supposed to mean?

524
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:45,762
Well, I'm glad you're here.

525
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,520
Thank you. Me too.
What's that supposed to mean?

526
00:18:47,552 --> 00:18:50,884
You don't like these kinds of things --
things with schedules and nametags.

527
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:52,323
You mock these kinds of things.

528
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:54,299
Well, I'm here.
I'm not mocking. I'm brunching.

529
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:56,046
I think you'll find
parents' weekend great fun.

530
00:18:56,077 --> 00:18:58,616
Thank you. It is. I am --
finding it great fun.

531
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:01,022
We always tour the campus,
check in here at Branford,

532
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:02,921
maybe take in a
faculty lecture or two,

533
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:04,283
and then take Rory
out to dinner.

534
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:05,751
You're taking Rory to dinner?

535
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:08,127
We're going to chez
Zinjustin this year,

536
00:19:08,142 --> 00:19:09,902
a fabulous french restaurant.

537
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,214
They have a crème brûlée
that is to die for.

538
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,210
Well, that sounds like fun.

539
00:19:13,244 --> 00:19:16,041
Too bad you're gonna miss the
tour of the gemstones of Yale.

540
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,133
The tour at Peabody?
I thought that was much earlier.

541
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:20,549
Yes, well, it is --
for the general public.

542
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:22,180
We signed up for a
special evening one.

543
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,047
Chris and I signed
up weeks ago.

544
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:24,997
Christopher's here?

545
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:27,348
Yes, 'cause he's a parent.
It's his weekend, too.

546
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:28,892
So, we'll go to the tour

547
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:31,951
and then probably hit a few panels,
go to the --

548
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:34,541
What is this you have on
your nametag -- "Zinf"?

549
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:35,901
What is "Zinf"?
Some kind of joke?

550
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,933
Oh, it's an old,
traditional Yale word... thingy.

551
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:41,598
What is that word --
"Zinf"? Is it hebrew?

552
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:42,836
Why is it on your nametag?

553
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:44,849
You guys don't know?
I thought you were all into Yale.

554
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:46,089
Hello, Emily. Richard.

555
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,451
Christopher. Nice to see you.

556
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:49,992
Hey, Lor, professor Quincy's
talk is about to start,

557
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:51,181
and I know you
probably don't --

558
00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:54,420
Don't want to miss a word.
Yes, that's true.

559
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:57,422
Well, we've got to go.
You enjoy your evening.

560
00:19:57,439 --> 00:20:00,424
Astrophysics waits for no man.

561
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,801
When supernovae explode,
they emit an energy

562
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:09,948
that is 4 billion times
greater than the sun.

563
00:20:09,964 --> 00:20:12,114
So powerful are these
explosions that even though

564
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,020
they're occurring halfway
across the observable universe,

565
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:17,458
some 7 billion
light-years away...

566
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,896
My parents have got a lot of nerve,
you know?

567
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:21,073
That's one thing they've got,
is nerve.

568
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,750
They should put
it to good use --

569
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:25,138
start a knife-throwing
contest or something.

570
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:26,251
Lor...

571
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:28,007
I mean, lunch? Please.

572
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:29,246
They get dinner,
and we get lunch?

573
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,278
Lunch is such a booby prize.

574
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:32,765
...we would be able to see

575
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:35,825
that the expansion of the
universe was slowing down.

576
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:38,901
I just can't believe Rory didn't tell
us that they were coming, you know.

577
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:43,880
Berate her. "Rory...
you... little... rat."

578
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:47,178
But we've learned that the expansion
of the universe is not slowing down --

579
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:48,790
It's speeding up.

580
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:52,240
She says that she assumed that
we knew they were coming.

581
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:55,283
"When you assume,
you make an --"

582
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,770
Shh!

583
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:59,884
Something else is
happening in the universe

584
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:02,407
that is counteracting the
powerful force of gravity,

585
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:04,691
and that's what we
call "dark energy."

586
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:08,189
Hey, you know what?
We should have lunch at chez Zinjustin.

587
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:10,060
I hear they have a
crème brûlée to die for.

588
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:12,076
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.

589
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:14,826
You can't make a
phone call in here.

590
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:16,698
I want to make sure
we get a reservation.

591
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:17,904
...back in the 1930s.

592
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,305
So, it may be that Einstein
was right all along.

593
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,754
Turns out the guy
was pretty smart.

594
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,405
All right,
are there any questions?

595
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:30,229
Yes?

596
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:31,858
Yeah, how can we tell
whether dark energy

597
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,342
is the same thing as the
cosmological constant?

598
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,908
Excellent question.

599
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,083
More thorough measurement from
observatories on the ground,

600
00:21:39,094 --> 00:21:41,573
from the Hbble
Space Telescope...

601
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:47,118
I was making
ratatouille anyway.

602
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:48,507
Excuse me?

603
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:51,970
Perfectly good vegetables,
and I was making ratatouille anyway,

604
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:54,110
and no sense in wasting them.

605
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,846
Did I miss something?

606
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:59,164
Not like there's anything
to feel guilty about.

607
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:01,301
Jackson sells his
vegetables all over town.

608
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:03,518
I'm not just gonna
throw these away.

609
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:06,300
Just because Lorelai is away
does not mean that I'm obligated

610
00:22:06,315 --> 00:22:08,629
to listen to your
incessant prattling.

611
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:11,055
I mean,
it would be wrong to waste vegetables.

612
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:13,129
Wasting vegetables is wrong.

613
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,152
I will listen to you
on one condition.

614
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,619
Call me "captain."

615
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,470
- No.
- Fine.

616
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:21,979
Okay... captain.

617
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:24,981
Yes?

618
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:28,174
The point is that Jackson's
vegetables are top-of-the-line,

619
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:29,211
first-rate.

620
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:33,086
But they're his vegetables,
you know, and these aren't.

621
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:34,774
These have something
different to offer,

622
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,229
and I shouldn't feel
guilty about --

623
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:40,470
You know what?
It's not worth it.

624
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:45,446
It's just ratatouille, okay?

625
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:47,558
Nothing to get all
riled up about.

626
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:50,330
Caesar, I'm back.

627
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,632
Hey, Luke, you want
to grab a cold one tonight,

628
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:54,652
- bird-dog some chicas?
- What?

629
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:58,681
As of 0700 this evening,
I'm going to be a free man.

630
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:00,301
- You are?
- I am.

631
00:23:00,317 --> 00:23:04,159
Giving Lulu the old heave-ho,
hitting the eject button.

632
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:05,223
Kirk?

633
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:06,634
I owe it all to you, buddy.

634
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:07,455
Me?

635
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,790
You inspired me.

636
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:11,504
I look at you, and I think,
"this guy's doing it right.

637
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,411
Slave to no master."

638
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:16,185
You come home at 3:00 in the morning --
no one cares.

639
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:18,849
You want to eat dessert for dinner --
no one cares.

640
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:21,220
You walk around in tube
socks and tighty whities --

641
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:22,590
no one cares.

642
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:25,917
No one cares what you
do or where you go.

643
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:28,209
So, what do you say, Luke?

644
00:23:28,224 --> 00:23:30,226
You want to be my wingman,

645
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:31,952
Goose to my Maverick?

646
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:35,462
# You never close your eyes anymore #

647
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:38,061
# When I kiss your lips #

648
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,987
# And there's no tenderness -- #

649
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,590
Listen, you pinhead,

650
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:44,074
you should be kissing the
ground that Lulu walks on.

651
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:47,093
Why that sweet girl lets you
within a hundred miles of her

652
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:49,212
is beyond me, but she does.

653
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,272
You are the luckiest man on the
planet to have a girl like that

654
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:54,343
looking out for you
and caring about you.

655
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:56,762
And if you say so much as
one unkind word to her,

656
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:59,790
I will personally break
every bone in your body.

657
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,462
You got me?

658
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:11,981
So, what did you end up
putting on the front page?

659
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:13,122
Don't play dumb, Paris.

660
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:15,518
My early-admission/early-actions piece.
No kidding.

661
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:17,092
It was a good article.

662
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:19,257
I'm hardly ever here anymore,
I'm putting in minimal effort

663
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:21,849
when I am here, and yet my article
is still the front-page lead.

664
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:22,845
It's almost too easy.

665
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,476
It's not locked yet, Paris.

666
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:26,693
Okay, A.K., you're gonna take
care of that Lacrosse caption?

667
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:27,824
What was wrong with what I had?

668
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:30,432
Well, you might save the metaphors
and alliterations for poetry class

669
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,783
and give me something
short and snappy.

670
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:33,377
And you might want
to mention Lacrosse.

671
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:34,164
You got it.

672
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:36,789
- I love how bossy she is.
- Well, she is their boss.

673
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:38,093
Yeah, I love that.

674
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,138
She's like a dictator,
only cute and nonviolent.

675
00:24:40,153 --> 00:24:42,064
And instead of a country,
she has a newspaper.

676
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:44,499
"Yale Lacrosse team sticks
it to Ivy League rivals"?

677
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:46,783
Done. Okay, so, A.K.
will take care of that.

678
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:49,171
And good job, everybody.
Layout is locked.

679
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:51,991
It's funny. It's almost like I'd have
to work harder not to get the front page.

680
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:53,449
Oh, hi, parents.

681
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:55,923
You are the cutest
fascist ever.

682
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:57,573
So, how was the morning?

683
00:24:57,585 --> 00:25:00,346
Brunch was lovely, except of course
for my parents skulking around,

684
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:02,664
which no one warned me about.
Hey, I forgot -- I'm still mad at you.

685
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:03,740
Don't be mad at me.

686
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,857
All right, fine. But only 'cause
you're the cutest despot ever.

687
00:25:05,893 --> 00:25:06,625
What else?

688
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:09,032
We had a few close
brushes with a cappella.

689
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:10,203
That was a narrow escape.

690
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,159
We were taking a shortcut on
the way to the lecture hall,

691
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:13,597
and we almost
shortcutted our way

692
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:16,293
into a group of guys wearing
tuxedos singing "zombie jamboree."

693
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,405
You guys went to a lecture?

694
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:20,101
Yes, where I learned that
the universe is expanding

695
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:22,459
and that your dad is a
big question-asking geek.

696
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:25,740
Hey, we have come to take you
to lunch at chez Zinjustin.

697
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:26,959
Wow. Fancy.

698
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,954
Apparently, the crème
brûlée is to die for.

699
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:30,420
Since when do you
say "to die for"?

700
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:31,868
Since he got addicted
to "Project Runway."

701
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,969
Make it work.

702
00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:34,324
You guys should meet everybody.

703
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:38,333
Mom and dad, this is Sheila,
Bill, A.K., Raj, and Joni.

704
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:40,192
- This is Christopher and Lorelai.
- Hello!

705
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,565
And you know Paris, of course.

706
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:42,790
Lorelai. It's been too long.

707
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:44,528
Hi. Oh. Wow. Okay.

708
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,734
And you know Christopher.

709
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:47,759
I believe we've met in passing.
Good to see you, Chris.

710
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:49,026
Good to see you.

711
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:51,894
We're just going to chez
Zinjustin for lunch.

712
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:53,332
You mean "Chez fancy pants."

713
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:56,053
My dad took me and my roommates
there for dinner freshman year --

714
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:58,394
back when he still loved me.
It's supernice.

715
00:25:58,411 --> 00:26:00,400
I hear they match your napkin
to what you're wearing.

716
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,019
I hear they fold your
napkin into an origami swan

717
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:04,255
every time you leave the table.

718
00:26:04,268 --> 00:26:06,958
I don't know for the napkins, but I
hear the crème brûlée is to die for.

719
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:09,147
- I heard that, too.
- You know what? You should all come along.

720
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,431
- Who? Us?
- Sure.

721
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:12,426
- Hey, let's bring the whole gang.
- Oh, dad, you don't have to --

722
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:14,497
I want to. It'll give me a chance
to get to know your friends.

723
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,032
- People might have plans.
- None.

724
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:17,757
- There's a shocker.
- I'm starving.

725
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:20,844
Well, all right, then.
Come on. Lunch on Rory's dad.

726
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,957
- Thank you.
- Cool.

727
00:26:30,413 --> 00:26:32,843
Ah, thank you.
The wine is wonderful.

728
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:34,888
I'm so glad you're enjoying it.

729
00:26:34,902 --> 00:26:37,340
Hey, this is a french restaurant.
Shouldn't all the servers be french?

730
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:40,335
Je ne suis pas français, mais je peux
parler français, si vous préférez.

731
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,614
Uh, where is the
nearest subway station?

732
00:26:44,397 --> 00:26:47,047
- Another bottle, sir?
- Absolutely.

733
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,953
Anyway, the chalet in Killington
had this open floor plan,

734
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:51,997
sort of the way Rory's
apartment's laid out.

735
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,000
I've never exactly
seen Rory's apartment.

736
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:54,872
Oh yeah?

737
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:57,779
We mostly just hang at the paper and --
mostly at the paper.

738
00:26:57,791 --> 00:27:00,513
Anyway, I really want to rent a
place at a ski resort this winter,

739
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:02,671
maybe Killington or Sugarloaf.

740
00:27:02,684 --> 00:27:03,707
That sounds great.

741
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,622
You know, you should come --
totally.

742
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:08,022
We'll get all of Rory's friends
together for a long weekend,

743
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,804
ski, hang out.
It'b be a blast.

744
00:27:09,821 --> 00:27:11,213
A ski trip sounds awesome.

745
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:12,040
Who's going skiing?

746
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:14,198
You are -- this winter.
Everyone's invited.

747
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:15,175
Right on.

748
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,412
You don't hang out with any of these
people outside the paper, do you?

749
00:27:17,442 --> 00:27:18,714
Not so much.

750
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:21,190
Okay. Who wants dessert?

751
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:23,548
I'd love a crème brûlée.
I've never had crème brûlée.

752
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:24,756
I could do with a cognac.

753
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:26,213
I wouldn't say no
to a digestif.

754
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,447
Crème brûlée for me.
And a cognac.

755
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:31,336
You know, I think we'd like to get
crème brûlée and cognac all around.

756
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:32,862
- Sorry.
- Why sorry?

757
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,741
- Sorry if this lunch is weird.
- No.

758
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,263
- Rory...
- Okay, this lunch is weird.

759
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,967
I feel like we're those
lame-o parents of yore.

760
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:41,435
Dad is trying kind of hard.

761
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,718
Yeah. Any minute,
he's gonna start juggling plates.

762
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:45,127
And hanging spoons
off his nose.

763
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,584
Yeah, but it's sweet.

764
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,319
Seriously, whenever you
guys get a 3-day weekend,

765
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:50,325
- you should totally come up.
- Can we rent skis there?

766
00:27:50,357 --> 00:27:51,955
Sure, or I can lend you a pair.

767
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,890
We'll have you jumping moguls down
a black diamond in no time, Raj.

768
00:27:54,903 --> 00:27:57,633
I guess it's good that I experience
a little bit of lame-o parenting.

769
00:27:57,648 --> 00:28:01,153
I mean, It's part of the quintessential
college experience, isn't it?

770
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:01,930
I guess.

771
00:28:01,944 --> 00:28:03,723
And it's great that you
got to meet the whole gang

772
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:06,553
before our big ski
vacation together.

773
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,659
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh" good or "uh-oh" bad?

774
00:28:09,674 --> 00:28:11,472
I guess there isn't really
an "uh-oh" good, is there?

775
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:14,627
Listen up, guys. A bunch of students
that were protesting the war

776
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,372
took over president
Stewart's office.

777
00:28:16,386 --> 00:28:18,154
It's look like we're gonna have
to rework the whole edition.

778
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:19,548
Why can't the news stop
while we're eating?

779
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,166
- I know, it's so impolite.
- I just got a text with a photo.

780
00:28:22,177 --> 00:28:25,263
Looks like they're wearing
George Bush masks and...

781
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:27,719
Are those Condoleezza
Rice masks?

782
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,876
They make Condoleezza masks?

783
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:30,221
We've got to get on
this, everybody.

784
00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:31,891
Um, so you guys, I'm sorry,
look like we've...

785
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,213
- It's okay, go.
- Duty calls.

786
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:35,418
Okay, Sheila,
get Keith on the phone

787
00:28:35,432 --> 00:28:37,653
and see if you can get him down there.
Actually, get Samantha down there, too.

788
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:39,886
I want so many photos of this thing,
I can make a flip book.

789
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:43,185
Bill and A.K., get back to the office so
you can proof the stories or emailing it in.

790
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:44,213
Everyone else, you're with me.

791
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:46,054
- What about the crème brûlée?
- And our cognac?

792
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:48,316
I have yet to taste the
sweet nectar of crème brûlée.

793
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,536
This is going to
be our front page.

794
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:50,830
Front page? Really?

795
00:28:50,843 --> 00:28:52,184
I think the front page
is fine as it is.

796
00:28:52,216 --> 00:28:52,788
Paris...

797
00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:55,147
Come on. We all know these
rabble-rousers are just looking
for attention.

798
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:56,538
- Why indulge them ?
- Let's go.

799
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:59,146
I want to go.
I want to report this story.

800
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:01,439
I just want to do it after
I eat my crème brûlée.

801
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,067
I mean, what if tonight
I get hit by lightning

802
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:05,294
and die a crème-Brûlée virgin?

803
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:06,951
A crème-Brûlée virgin?

804
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:09,453
You know what? Enough.
This is a major political protest.

805
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:11,747
It's a big story,
and it's going to go on our front page.

806
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:14,145
Now get your drunk, crème-brûlée-craving
asses out of these chairs,

807
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:15,669
and let's get to work, okay?

808
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:17,675
Besides the lead,
I'm going to need some color --

809
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:19,159
what's going on behind the masks,
that kind of things.

810
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:20,377
Joni, you want to
take a crack at that?

811
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:21,585
I'm a little tipsy.

812
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,485
Okay, is there anyone
who's not a little tipsy?

813
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,002
Thanks for lunch, dad.

814
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:26,344
- Thank you.
- Lunch was great.

815
00:29:26,356 --> 00:29:28,378
- Great meeting you.
- See you later.

816
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,998
Well, I hope you're hungry
for some crème brûlée.

817
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:37,908
Are you sure you want to
fianchetto that bishop so early?

818
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:39,844
I don't know,
it depends on what "fianchetto" means.

819
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:42,157
It means I'm gonna kick your
butt if you make that move.

820
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:43,749
Well, you're kicking my butt anyway,
so I don't see

821
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,482
how one fianchetto is gonna
make much of a difference.

822
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:48,359
Besides, it sounds fancy and make me seem like
I know what I'm doing.

823
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:50,009
You're not very good.

824
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:51,313
April.

825
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:52,936
Sorry. I can be blunt.

826
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,055
Tell it like it is, sister.

827
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:55,995
Besides, later tonight,
when we Boggle,

828
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,181
which is what I was told
we'd be playing tonight,

829
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,759
it is your butt that is going to be
kicked, because I've been studying

830
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:03,320
my 7-letter words that
sound made-up but aren't.

831
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:05,979
"Palfrey" -- P-A-L-F-R-E-Y.

832
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:07,186
It's a saddle
horse for a woman.

833
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:07,858
Impressive.

834
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:10,631
Okay, so,
coach Bennett and I are gonna go out

835
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:13,592
and have some dinner together and talk,
and then I'll be home.

836
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:14,905
Shouldn't be more
than a couple hours.

837
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,006
Just a dinner and some talking.

838
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,529
It would be weird if it was
a dinner with no talking.

839
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:20,257
Sure.

840
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:23,271
And you should probably call her "Susan"
tonight, instead of "coach Bennett" --

841
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:24,956
- I think she'd prefer that.
- Good tip.

842
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,079
We'll hang out
until you get back.

843
00:30:26,113 --> 00:30:27,527
Okay, you got the number
of the restaurant.

844
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,569
I'm gonna have my cellphone on me,
so if there are any problems --

845
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:32,314
Thank you, Luke. Bye.

846
00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:33,846
- Bye, dad.
- See you later.

847
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,034
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

848
00:30:39,051 --> 00:30:41,042
Okay, now,
it's your move, darlin',

849
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:44,878
unless you'd rather discuss zymurgy --
Z-Y-M-U-R-G-Y --

850
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:47,351
the branch of applied chemistry
dealing with fermentation.

851
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:49,500
All right, all right.
We can play Boggle.

852
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:50,898
Yes!

853
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:55,504
Hello. Two?

854
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:57,172
Okay, right this way.

855
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:02,799
There you go.

856
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:05,659
Your waitress will
be right with you.

857
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:08,084
Thank you.
Oh, no. Come sit with me.

858
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:10,337
- There?
- Yeah. It's cozier.

859
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:11,261
Oh. Okay.

860
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:13,531
I hate being so far away.

861
00:31:17,765 --> 00:31:19,862
- Wow!
- I know, right?

862
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,647
It's my favorite restaurant.

863
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:23,238
And you said you liked
to eat healthy, so --

864
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:24,899
Yeah. Huh.
I've never eaten this healthy.

865
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:27,179
So, "vegan" doesn't
just mean "vegetarian."

866
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:29,462
No --
no animal products of any kind.

867
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:31,398
No eggs, no milk, no cheese.

868
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:32,434
Just soy everything.

869
00:31:32,449 --> 00:31:34,240
Soy steak is scrumptious.

870
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:35,812
I swear you totally can't
tell the difference.

871
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:37,258
Oh, I bet I can.

872
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:39,523
So, Luke,
let me ask you a question.

873
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:40,615
Okay.

874
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:45,221
Who would play you in
the Luke Danes movie?

875
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,214
- Huh?
- Alive or dead.

876
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,994
Uh... I never really
thought about that.

877
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,375
Take your time.
Do you want to know mine?

878
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:52,651
Sure.

879
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,473
Marlene Dietrich. Right?

880
00:31:55,485 --> 00:31:57,456
- I don't know who that is.
- Sure you do.

881
00:31:57,471 --> 00:31:58,711
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

882
00:31:58,729 --> 00:31:59,693
- Think.
- I don't.

883
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:02,424
"Touch of evil," "The
lady is willing,"

884
00:32:02,438 --> 00:32:03,721
"Destry rides again."

885
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:08,142
"Your husband would rather be
cheated by me than married to you."

886
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:09,445
Oh, yeah, sure.

887
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,536
My last boyfriend --
"the ex" --

888
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:13,694
He was always
calling me "Marlene!"

889
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,687
Oh, you know what?
I think you might know him.

890
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:17,155
Bob McCullough, Laura's father?

891
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:19,055
No, I don't think I do.

892
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,818
We lived together
for four months,

893
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:25,309
and then he just
went totally psycho.

894
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,840
- Psycho!
- ...egg corns.

895
00:32:26,854 --> 00:32:29,327
I swore I wasn't gonna date any
more single dads after that,

896
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,763
but here I am.

897
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:34,264
You hooked me.

898
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,005
Well, you know what they say --
third time's a charm.

899
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,205
Can I get anybody a drink?

900
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:40,586
Yes, please.

901
00:32:40,598 --> 00:32:42,982
I heard a bone crack,
several bones cracking.

902
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:44,576
Crack, crack, crack --
it was like fireworks.

903
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:46,444
Rugby is a violent sport.

904
00:32:46,457 --> 00:32:48,736
I guess the fact that an ambulance
was parked by the side of the field

905
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,769
before the game even started
should've been my first clue.

906
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:53,850
They don't park ambulances
next to tetherball matches.

907
00:32:53,862 --> 00:32:55,882
I can't believe we lost.
It was so violent.

908
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:57,732
I guess they were
just violenter.

909
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,438
Uh, it's Rory.

910
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:01,042
They're at the paper.
They're still working.

911
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:01,932
Man!

912
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:04,387
Half of them are
drunk or hung over.

913
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,473
Joni passed out.

914
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:06,450
Oh, jeez.

915
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:07,906
Looks like she's gonna
be there all night.

916
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:09,404
Oh, that's not good news.

917
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:11,331
Well, silver lining --

918
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:13,863
that means she won't get to
have dinner with my parents.

919
00:33:13,878 --> 00:33:17,049
We got the only meal.
We won parents' weekend,

920
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,486
and we didn't even
break any bones.

921
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:20,182
Yeah. Some meal.

922
00:33:20,196 --> 00:33:21,373
What's wrong?

923
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:24,719
Nothing. I just --
I... I screwed up.

924
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:25,793
What do you mean,
you screwed up?

925
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:28,190
It's my fault that Rory's
got to work all night.

926
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,676
What do you mean?
You staged the student protest?

927
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:33,896
You wore a condi mask and manacled
yourself to the president's door?

928
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,779
The big meal,
ordering all that wine.

929
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:37,406
Her staff's a mess.
It's my fault.

930
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:38,934
Honey, if those kids are
gonna be journalists,

931
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:40,303
they have to learn
to write drunk.

932
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,355
I'm trying to be
superdad or something.

933
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:43,910
- Why?
- I don't know.

934
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:46,624
Does it have to do with the nametag-
in-the-middle-of-the-chest thing?

935
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:49,519
At the brunch, all the other
dads were talking about how

936
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:53,098
they took their kids to hockey
practice and violin lessons

937
00:33:53,112 --> 00:33:54,863
and helped them study
for the S.A.T.s,

938
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,242
and I just stood there like a jerk,
nodding my head

939
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,640
like I'd done all those things.

940
00:33:58,655 --> 00:33:59,599
Oh, honey.

941
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:01,239
I didn't do any
of those things.

942
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:04,336
First of all, Rory didn't need
someone to check her homework.

943
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:05,650
She was a self-starter.

944
00:34:05,664 --> 00:34:07,300
Second of all,
she wasn't interested in hockey.

945
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,930
And third of all,
you don't have to try to be superdad.

946
00:34:09,945 --> 00:34:11,088
I feel like I should be.

947
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:13,485
No. You can just relax,
you know?

948
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:15,558
Be yourself.
Be the dad that you are --

949
00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:17,916
Clark Kent dad,
Christopher Hayden dad.

950
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,125
I guess.

951
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,823
Totally.

952
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:23,049
It's just -- it's too late.

953
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,665
I mean, I've got G.G.,
and that's great, but Rory --

954
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:27,595
Rory's grown up. I missed it.

955
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,631
You didn't miss it.

956
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:30,087
She's a senior in college, Lor.

957
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,005
We have years of hard
parenting ahead.

958
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:34,280
She is due for a
quarter-life crisis.

959
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,342
All those years of
stability do not bode well.

960
00:34:36,356 --> 00:34:37,442
We're gonna have plenty to do.

961
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:38,938
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

962
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:40,800
And the best part is...

963
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:42,602
we get to deal
with it together.

964
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:44,597
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

965
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,775
Quarter-life crisis, huh?

966
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:49,757
I'm pretty sure she's gonna
spin wildly out of control.

967
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:52,560
We're gonna have to do an intervention,
put her through rehab,

968
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:56,329
give her a place to stay while
she's divorcing the hell's angel.

969
00:34:56,343 --> 00:35:00,066
# It don't make a difference #
# If we make it or not #

970
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:03,682
# We've both got one another #
# And that's a lot #

971
00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:07,682
# For love #
# Let's give it a shot #

972
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:11,507
# Whoooa #
# We're halfway there #

973
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:15,506
# Ohhh, ohhh #
# We're livin' on a prayer #

974
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:19,013
Divine. The tomatoes
are so fresh and meaty.

975
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:20,405
The eggplant is what
puts it over the top.

976
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:21,920
Perfect sweetness.
Your best ever.

977
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,195
Well, I wouldn't say my best.

978
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,986
It is. It's a whole new level of flavor,
like a vegetable symphony.

979
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,002
What do you think, captain?

980
00:35:27,036 --> 00:35:28,747
It's true.
It even surpasses my mother's,

981
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:30,965
and that woman made
ratatouille for a living.

982
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:33,093
Well done, Sookie.

983
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:34,396
Brava, maestra.

984
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:35,788
It's just ratatouille, okay?

985
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,675
Now, go get back to work.

986
00:35:37,692 --> 00:35:39,334
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

987
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:41,032
- Hey.
- Hey!

988
00:35:41,047 --> 00:35:43,104
- You ready to go?
- Ready, Freddy!

989
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:44,755
Just dropped the kids
off at the Bstics'.

990
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,634
They made me take
my shoes off again.

991
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,023
They make everybody
take off their shoes.

992
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:50,470
I can't remember the last time I saw
the Bstics in anything but socks.

993
00:35:50,502 --> 00:35:53,396
Then they had the audacity to
complain that my feet smell.

994
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:54,470
They really complained?

995
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:56,722
Well, they made sour faces
when I wasn't looking

996
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,324
- and rolled their eyes.
- Oh, Jackson.

997
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:01,431
What do they expect?
Of course my feet smell.

998
00:36:01,448 --> 00:36:03,073
I work in the fields all day.

999
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:05,977
That's why I wear these big zip boots --
in order to contain the smell.

1000
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:07,763
I swear, the next time they
come over to the house,

1001
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:09,892
I'm gonna ask them to take
off their pants or something.

1002
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:11,033
It's outrageous!

1003
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:13,326
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Yeah, well...

1004
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,277
I know the Bostics
are a little nutso.

1005
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:18,550
Very nutso.
Who irons their couch?

1006
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,691
But Martha and Davy
love going over there

1007
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:22,954
and playing with Kayla and Ryan,
and when they come back,

1008
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:26,912
they're so polite and cordial
for like an hour, which is nice.

1009
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,581
That is a bonus, but still.

1010
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:31,394
I know. I'll get my purse.

1011
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:39,238
No!

1012
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,490
- What?
- Ooh! Bad batch!

1013
00:36:41,506 --> 00:36:43,526
Saving it for the horses.

1014
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:45,740
But you never mess
up your ratatouille.

1015
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:48,511
Everyone's allowed a mistake
or two here and there.

1016
00:36:48,524 --> 00:36:50,784
You know what?
I'm just gonna -- just junk it.

1017
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:52,712
Are you sure?
It smells fantastic.

1018
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:54,631
I'm sure. Trust me --
it's awful.

1019
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,481
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

1020
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:59,855
What do you think about a
nice romantic dinner, huh?

1021
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,779
How about Cicero's?

1022
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:02,301
Wow. Cicero's.

1023
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:03,319
Yeah.

1024
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:04,977
They have good ratatouille.

1025
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:07,278
Okay, so long as I
can keep my shoes on.

1026
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:10,513
Unless Cicero's has suddenly gone
japanese, I think we're good.

1027
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:39,438
The first name that
I'm going to call is...

1028
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:41,068
A.J.

1029
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,851
She was very well-behaved.

1030
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:44,786
Glad to hear it. Lane?

1031
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,244
- Hey, Luke.
- I'm home.

1032
00:37:47,257 --> 00:37:49,516
You zonked out about
20 minutes ago.

1033
00:37:49,532 --> 00:37:52,662
Well, I should probably do the rest
of my zonking in my own apartment.

1034
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:54,732
Thank you for hanging out
with me tonight, April.

1035
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:55,633
My pleasure.

1036
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,917
- See you tomorrow, Luke.
- See you tomorrow, Lane.

1037
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,307
So, you guys had fun?

1038
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,194
Totally. Lane's awesome.

1039
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:03,710
How about you?

1040
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:07,882
It was nice, you know?
We had vegan food.

1041
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:09,798
Ooh. You couldn't
have liked that.

1042
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:13,646
I did not, but coach Bennett
really seemed to enjoy it.

1043
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,274
So, you're still calling
her "coach Bennett"?

1044
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:19,360
I think she'll just remain
"coach Bennett" to me.

1045
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,828
That's cool.

1046
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:23,592
Hey, is that pizza
still up for grabs?

1047
00:38:23,606 --> 00:38:25,747
- Go crazy.
- Oh. I'm starving.

1048
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,493
Real cheese.

1049
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:30,162
We also ordered sticky buns.

1050
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,752
Bring it on.

1051
00:38:39,515 --> 00:38:41,237
No quote from
president Stewart yet?

1052
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:41,849
Nothing.

1053
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:42,965
Have we picked the photo?

1054
00:38:42,977 --> 00:38:44,363
Sheila's got some
options for you.

1055
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:46,235
- Layout's coming along.
- Good. Okay.

1056
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:48,315
Keep it moving.
We have a deadline here.

1057
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:50,500
Ow! Who made this
phone so loud?

1058
00:38:50,515 --> 00:38:52,408
Yale Daily News.

1059
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:54,644
Will do.

1060
00:38:54,657 --> 00:38:56,581
We got ourselves a quote.
Steve's e-mailing it in now.

1061
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:58,472
Great. Okay, would you mind
inputting these corrections?

1062
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,333
Anything to get away
from that phone.

1063
00:39:00,344 --> 00:39:01,578
Hey, gang.

1064
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:02,529
Hey.

1065
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,013
We come bearing
doughnuts and coffee.

1066
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:06,345
Gather 'round.
The chocolate eclairs are to die for.

1067
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:07,321
Thanks, guys.

1068
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:09,405
We figured you'd need some
all-nighter supplies.

1069
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:13,594
Hey. So, um, I'm sorry about
getting your staff drunk.

1070
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:14,718
Oh, don't worry about it.

1071
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:16,030
You seemed pretty upset
at the restaurant.

1072
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,632
I was just stressed out.
It's no big deal.

1073
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:19,063
- So, you're not mad?
- No.

1074
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:22,225
But dad, I think I would've liked
it better if on parents' weekend,

1075
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:24,223
I could've just had
lunch with my parents.

1076
00:39:24,235 --> 00:39:25,478
Yeah, that would've
been better.

1077
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,588
Next year --
grad-school parents' weekend.

1078
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,563
Hey, if it's okay with you,
you mind if we hang out

1079
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:31,683
- and watch you in action?
- Oh, I don't think you can hang out,

1080
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:33,380
- 'cause you're gonna be late --
- Late for...

1081
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,971
For your dinner reservations
at chez Zinjustin.

1082
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:37,800
I told grandma and grandpa
that I couldn't make it,

1083
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,402
but I accidentally told them
that you guys were free.

1084
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,003
- You're evil.
- You were mad.

1085
00:39:42,015 --> 00:39:45,532
Isn't that a coincidence that they
had a reservation there, too?

1086
00:39:45,544 --> 00:39:46,508
Oh, don't eat that doughnut,

1087
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:48,062
'cause I hear they have
a crème brûlée that is --

1088
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:48,906
Don't.

1089
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,939
Come on, get your lame-o-parent
selves out the door.

1090
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,284
You don't want to be late.
That'll tick them off.

1091
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:53,259
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1092
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:54,615
Bye-bye.
