1
00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:03,423
Lane, we're getting backed up here.

2
00:00:03,424 --> 00:00:04,663
Done in a sec.

3
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:07,922
- Hey.
- Hey.

4
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:09,940
No bacon today. I had to fire my meat guy.

5
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:12,032
How could you fire Pepper Pot?

6
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:15,597
He's so cute, and his mother has that
skin condition they can't diagnose.

7
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:16,824
He never brings what I order.

8
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:19,211
I have 16 pounds of corned
beef and no turkey.

9
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:23,311
But he's so sweet, and his father has that
foot-grafting operation coming up next month.

10
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:25,978
I can't keep a guy on because his
parents are falling apart.

11
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:28,513
I know,
but he tells those funny little limericks,

12
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:31,404
and his sisters were just surgically
separated two weeks ago.

13
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:32,382
What are you doing, Kirk?

14
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:33,863
Did you just eat a 3 musketeers?

15
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:34,474
No.

16
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:36,438
You're sure? You really smell like nougat.

17
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,226
Stop sniffing my fiancee.

18
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:41,245
I can't help it. My senses are much
more finely tuned these days.

19
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:42,620
What is the scary man talking about?

20
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:43,997
He's on a juice fast.

21
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:44,618
Why?

22
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:47,766
Just wanted to clean out the pipes,
refocus the arteries.

23
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:50,880
I want to get the healthy glow of someone
who consistently goes to the gym...

24
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,485
without having to go to the gym, of course.

25
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,012
Of course. You look positively radiant.

26
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:54,775
You want eggs?

27
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:55,610
Eggs...

28
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:57,170
Scrambled and a couple pancakes, please.

29
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:58,410
Blueberry pancakes.

30
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:59,545
Kirk, eat something.

31
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:01,490
What? Oh, no, I'm doing fine.

32
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:03,264
Yeah, okay. Hold on there, speed racer.

33
00:01:03,265 --> 00:01:05,925
I have to get these orders since
I'm the only one serving here.

34
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:07,135
Almost done, Luke.

35
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:08,941
I just want to remind you
about Rory's panel--

36
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:09,443
What?

37
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,761
The panel I'm going to today.
The Young Voices of Journalism panel.

38
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:13,634
Rory's thing?

39
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:16,230
Yes. Well, it looks like Christopher
is going to be there, also,

40
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:17,452
and I just thought you should know.

41
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,072
He's been showing up a lot lately.

42
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:21,709
He's trying to make good for Rory, so...

43
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,462
I'm good. I'll get you those pancakes.

44
00:01:23,463 --> 00:01:25,412
Blueberry pancakes. Blueberry pancakes!

45
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:26,783
Okay, what do you think?

46
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,456
Oh! Oh, nice. Very "white rabbit."

47
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,843
Well, I want it to stand out.

48
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:33,186
It does. It's great.

49
00:01:33,187 --> 00:01:34,770
What do you think of the picture?

50
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,245
The picture's great.
What's wrong with the picture?

51
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,693
I photograph so Asian.

52
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:40,366
Yeah, well,
I think Ming-Na has that same problem.

53
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,852
I just have to get back in a band.
I'm going crazy not playing.

54
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:43,678
I can imagine.

55
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:48,702
I mean, you go from having band practice
every day and seeing
certain people every day,

56
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,148
and then suddenly you're not.

57
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:51,497
You mean Zach?

58
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:53,122
And Brian and Gil.

59
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:55,538
Yeah. You guys still aren't talking?

60
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,171
Well, the flyer is great.

61
00:01:58,172 --> 00:01:58,887
Thanks.

62
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:01,479
I like the shiny, fancy pens you used.

63
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,668
They're Luke's daughter's, actually.
She left them here last week,
and I snagged them.

64
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,049
Good score.

65
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:09,286
So she's been coming around
a lot lately, huh?

66
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:11,575
Yeah, she comes in here and studies or draws.

67
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:13,403
We even play some games when things get slow.

68
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:15,213
She kicks my ass at scrabble.

69
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:15,983
Oh, yeah?

70
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:18,863
Of course, when we play monopoly, I rule,
because she's a kid

71
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:20,952
and hasn't gotten the monopoly concept.

72
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:23,477
She still thinks park place is a good buy.

73
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:24,171
Sweet.

74
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:25,290
Yeah.

75
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,816
I used to play board games with Rory a lot.

76
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:30,875
She'd get very upset when I'd cheat. So cute.

77
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:32,478
It's hard to cheat with April.

78
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,353
She spends the first 20 minutes reading
the rules manual right in front of you.

79
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:38,279
Rory was obsessed with battleship.

80
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,492
I always thought she was gonna join
the navy when she grew up.

81
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,663
Well, there's still time.

82
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:42,795
Yes, fingers crossed.

83
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,333
Hey, Lane, how about a raise?

84
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:45,170
Sorry, Luke.

85
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,317
I got to go.

86
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:48,881
Peach shampoo?

87
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,079
You hate it.

88
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,114
Jony, I don't,
and I promise I'm gonna run it.

89
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,278
I just need you to cut about 400 words.

90
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,420
Don't give me that look. Simplify your prose.

91
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:56,424
You'll still get your point across,
and I won't have to publish

92
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:59,451
a newspaper the size of a David
Foster Wallace novel.

93
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,511
Paris?

94
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,203
Yes?

95
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:04,937
I just wanted to give you some notes
on your campus safety piece.

96
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:06,025
Fine.

97
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:09,355
Um, well, I think it's good.

98
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:12,465
It's really good, actually, um,
but the lead's a little flabby.

99
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:15,360
Getting into an example might
give it more punch up top.

100
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:17,359
If you say so. Anything else?

101
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:23,198
Uh, some of the quotes read too long.
I'd cut two or three and trim--

102
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:24,165
Paris, what are you doing?

103
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,210
I don't know. What am I doing?

104
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,707
You're not making eye contact with me.

105
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,808
I'm looking right at you.

106
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,516
No, you're not.

107
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,384
Want to test me?

108
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:30,818
Brown hair, blue eyes.

109
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:33,614
Fine. Here's your hard copy.
I think those notes will help.

110
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:35,188
Of course you do. They're your notes.

111
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:37,772
Not because they're my notes,
because they're good notes.

112
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:39,850
Says the note giver. It'll take half an hour.

113
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,053
Fine.

114
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:45,566
That was unpleasant.

115
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,551
Try sleeping with her.

116
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,500
I'll take your word for it.

117
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,884
No, it's impossible because
she doesn't sleep anymore.

118
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:51,728
She makes damn sure I don't, either.

119
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:55,112
Last night she decided it would be fun to
watch "Saw II" at 3:00 in the morning.

120
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:57,092
Then when I woke up and asked her
if she could turn it down,

121
00:04:57,093 --> 00:04:58,943
she berated me for being a film snob.

122
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:00,014
How are you handling it?

123
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02,886
I believe the psychological term for
it is "keeping my mouth shut."

124
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,341
I don't know what to do with her.

125
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:05,719
She's one of the best reporters we have,

126
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,399
but she has gone way beyond
her normal level of nuts.

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,452
She's on the warpath right now.
She'll calm down.

128
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:11,845
She just needs some time.

129
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,760
You know, maybe I could give her more to do.

130
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:15,856
That piece she just wrote would
make a great series.

131
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,973
Giving her something like that
might help her rebound faster,

132
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:20,849
make her the normal Paris again.
What do you think?

133
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,454
Um, sure.

134
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,653
That wasn't very convincing.

135
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,013
It's your call.

136
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:28,607
Doyle, come on.
Former editor to current editor.
What do you think?

137
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,265
Would you do that for any other staffer
who was treating you the way she is?

138
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,299
No.

139
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,669
Look, I have more interest in Paris
snapping out of this than anyone.

140
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,446
I just think it's something she's
gonna get to on her own.

141
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:41,468
Yeah.

142
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:43,422
Yeah, you're probably right.

143
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,772
I got to go.

144
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:47,915
I'm gonna sneak back to the apartment,
see if I can get a few hours of sleep

145
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:51,610
before Paris comes home and spends
the rest of the night wanting
to play the jazz trumpet.

146
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:53,652
Yeah, she bought a trumpet.

147
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,436
Hey, Lou. Okay if I put an ad up?

148
00:05:56,437 --> 00:05:57,909
They come down after two weeks.

149
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,448
I can abide by that.

150
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:01,543
# Take me riding in the car, car #

151
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,059
# Take me riding in the car, car #

152
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,022
# Take me riding in the car, car #

153
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,887
# I'll take you riding in the car #

154
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,790
Joel.

155
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,260
Mom, come on. That's not cool.

156
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:14,764
# Click-clack, open up the door, girls"

157
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:16,613
# Click-clack, open up the door, boys #

158
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:20,189
# Front door, back door, clickety-clack #

159
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,570
Joel, take it.

160
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,235
Take what?

161
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:25,878
The song. Take it.

162
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,615
Well, unh!

163
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,166
Yeah!

164
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:32,477
Unh!

165
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,604
Unh unh! Unh unh! Yeah!

166
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:38,811
Unh! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

167
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:45,133
Hey.

168
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,050
Aah! Oh, you scared me.

169
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,074
- Sorry.
- What?

170
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,627
- Sorry!
- What?!

171
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:55,009
Sorry.

172
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,456
I guess that was a little loud.

173
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,082
- What?!
- Sorry!

174
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:00,345
I'm telling you,
we should take this on the road.

175
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:02,511
I see you went with Faye
Dunaway in "Network."

176
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:05,446
And Maureen Dowd "come hither"
pumps for good measure.

177
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:06,782
I wish I could be there for you.

178
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:07,739
Oh, you do not.

179
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,555
I do, too.

180
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:10,077
You'd be asleep in three minutes.

181
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,417
The pumps would've kept me
going for at least four.

182
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:15,020
I'm in a suit at 2:00 in the afternoon.

183
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:17,014
Honor has to have everyone dressed
for a wedding rehearsal.

184
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:18,248
How'd I get conned into this?

185
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:19,120
Into what?

186
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:20,472
Being one of Josh's Groomsmen.

187
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,441
You like Josh.

188
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,570
I don't even know Josh.

189
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:23,829
He's gonna be your brother-in-law.

190
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,227
Yes, exactly. Going to be.
Key word is "going." He's not now.

191
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:28,717
Your tie is crooked.

192
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:31,370
But as of today, Josh is simply the guy

193
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:33,301
who holds my sister's purse
when she goes shopping,

194
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:34,919
and because of that,
I have to spend the next six hours

195
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,649
practicing to walk in a straight line.

196
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,221
You have yet to accomplish that,
so practice wouldn't hurt.

197
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:40,967
I'm not there, and I'm bored already.

198
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:43,248
You can always talk to your
good friend flasky.

199
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:45,510
Right. Thanks for the reminder.

200
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,624
I just don't understand wedding rehearsals.

201
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,766
The bachelor party, I get.

202
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,063
I bet you do.

203
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:53,124
The actual ceremony, I get.

204
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,626
But the rehearsal, I don't get.

205
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:55,432
Wallet.

206
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,990
And after we finish rehearsing,
I have to sit through a 5-course dinner

207
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:01,264
surrounded by my new family and Honor's
brigade of moronic bridesmaids.

208
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:04,471
Oh, come on, you love Honor.
Her friends can't be that bad.

209
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:08,604
Oh, no. Blondie, Dipsy, Bubbles,

210
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:11,171
Four nose jobs, Charm McGee-- all great gals.

211
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:11,982
Meow.

212
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:15,344
Seriously, can't you just do the panel,
blow off the mixer,

213
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:16,671
and meet me for the dinner?

214
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:20,239
Logan, come on. By the time I get out
of there and get back here to change,

215
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,448
drive all the way to New York,
dinner would be over.

216
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:25,090
No, it wouldn't.
Dinner's never gonna be over.
It's gonna last forever.

217
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:29,270
I will be here waiting for you when you
get back, and I will have aspirin.

218
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:30,869
Fine. I'll be back by 11:00--

219
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,384
10:50, possibly 10:30.

220
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:33,091
Go.

221
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,219
Fine.

222
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:39,064
Did you forget something?

223
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,376
You look incredible.

224
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:45,820
Knock 'em dead.

225
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:03,620
- Hey.
- Hey.

226
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:06,242
Nice seats.

227
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:08,593
I got here early and scouted
out the best ones.

228
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,975
We were actually more towards the middle,
but then two people--

229
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:14,037
I'm pretty sure it was Brigitte Nielsen
and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar--

230
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,627
sat right in front of me.

231
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:17,554
Brigitte and Kareem showed up, huh?

232
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:21,474
I swear,
any place with free cheese and crackers,
they are there.

233
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:23,153
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

234
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:26,633
I think this haircut cost more than all the
haircuts I've had in my life combined.

235
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:30,227
Hmm. Well, it was worth it. It looks very,
very short.

236
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:31,455
Mom, dad.

237
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:32,494
The woman of the hour.

238
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:34,495
- You made it.
- Of course we did.

239
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:36,772
Careful! The hair-- it's pinned perfectly.

240
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:37,425
Whoa.

241
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,624
Yeah. Sorry. So, are you excited?

242
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,012
Yeah, and nervous.
I've actually got a lot of talking points.

243
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:44,104
I just feel like I'm gonna get up
there and forget everything.

244
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,465
You're gonna do great, hon.

245
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,706
Yeah, you are.
You're a natural at this kind of thing.

246
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:50,496
Just remember-- if things don't go well,
we will stop loving you.

247
00:09:50,497 --> 00:09:52,400
I better get up there.
I'll see you guys afterwards.

248
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,795
Yeah. We'll be rooting for you.

249
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:56,072
It's not really a root-for-me kind of thing,
but thank you.

250
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,646
Well, we brought foam fingers.

251
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:00,047
And we're doing the wave if things get dull.

252
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:03,774
Dud?

253
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:06,630
Welcome, everybody,
to the Young Voices of Journalism Panel.

254
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,216
I'm Arthur Gordon,
a professor of English here at Yale,

255
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:11,233
and I shall be moderating today's panel.

256
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,853
We're joined today by the editors of some

257
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:16,940
of the country's most prestigious
collegiate newspapers.

258
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:17,868
Whoo-hoo!

259
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:20,553
We have before us editors
from the Harvard Crimson,

260
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,799
the Daily Princetonian,
the Cornell Daily Sun,

261
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,858
the Daily Pennsylvanian,
and the Yale Daily News

262
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,813
all here today to tell us
what's on their minds,

263
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:32,037
to hear where they think ivy-league
journalism is heading,

264
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:36,631
and more broadly, to share their views on
the future of the free press in America.

265
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:37,688
Whoa. Heavy.

266
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:42,029
So, I will begin by posing a series
of questions to our panel.

267
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,471
Now let's begin.

268
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:47,670
I was wondering how the panelists would
describe the state of journalistic ethics

269
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:50,992
on a collegiate level in the
post-Judy Miller era, and--

270
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:53,118
Wonderful question. Quentin Walsh,
Daily Princetonian.

271
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,110
The ramifications of the scandal to which

272
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,779
you obliquely alluded ought
not to be underestimated.

273
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,174
I hate this guy already.

274
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,504
Rory told me about him.
That's "Pompous Princeton Guy."

275
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:03,800
Well sure, If your parents name you that,
what chance do you have?

276
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:06,505
The struggle to preserve the fundamental
principles and rights

277
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:09,102
upon which our free press depends
was made far more difficult

278
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:12,683
by the choice of certain reporters
who shall remain unnamed

279
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:16,217
to capitulate to governmental pressure
and divulge their sources.

280
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,546
He's unbelievable.

281
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:19,056
He's wearing a bow tie.

282
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:19,973
Should I dud him?

283
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:23,536
I myself have, on occasion, felt tremendous
pressure to divulge unnamed sources,

284
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:27,223
but I've stood my ground, knowing that while
I may suffer for my principled stand,

285
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:28,907
there was a much greater issue at stake.

286
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,120
If I may?

287
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,403
Rory Gilmore, Yale Daily News.

288
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:35,565
While I agree that there is no
greater or more important tool

289
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:38,264
for a free press than confidential sources,

290
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:40,683
I also think it unwise for us to presume

291
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:43,909
from our limited experiences
editing college newspapers

292
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,868
that we really have any true understanding
of what it must feel like

293
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:49,898
when the federal government of the United
States puts the screws to you.

294
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,055
I just think it would be the height
of hubris for us to claim for fact

295
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:56,020
that we know what we would do when
faced with that kind of pressure.

296
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:57,730
But that's just one reporter's opinion.

297
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:58,648
We created her.

298
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:00,124
Out of thin air.

299
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:04,610
I just don't care how funny the picture is.

300
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:07,343
If it's not newsworthy-- and I
can't see how it would be--

301
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:10,539
I would not publish a picture of the
university president stuffing his face

302
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,784
with key lime pie at the
drama club bake sale.

303
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:15,622
I'm sure President Levin will
be pleased to hear that.

304
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:20,565
If someone pushed key lime pie in the
president's face as a statement,
that I would print.

305
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:21,862
Me, too-- front page.

306
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:24,472
Quentin, you agreed with me.
I didn't think you were capable.

307
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,479
On that collegial note,
I'm afraid we have to end our discussion.

308
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,243
I'd like to thank all our panelists
for a terrific discussion
and thank you all for coming.

309
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:33,595
Our girl's got skills.

310
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:38,138
She even had her arch rival laughing
with her by the end.

311
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:40,151
She's keeping her enemies close and giggling.

312
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:41,460
Very devious.

313
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:43,328
So?

314
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,630
If I had a cooler of Gatorade,
I'd pour it over your head.

315
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,007
Sounds refreshing. So, I was pretty good,
wasn't I?

316
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:48,884
You dazzled.

317
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:51,443
You totally wiped the floor
with Pompous Princeton Guy.

318
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:53,247
Well, the floor looked a little dirty.

319
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:54,704
So, can we take you out
for an ice-cream soda?

320
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:57,923
Sorry. I got to go.
We have this editors' mixer thing now.
Rain check?

321
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,226
Yeah, go. Mix well.

322
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:00,589
- Bye, hon.
- Bye.

323
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:02,083
We were just rain-checked.

324
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:02,723
Yep.

325
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:04,229
I don't know how I feel about that.

326
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:06,868
Okay, so I kept track, wrote 'em down.

327
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,547
I got 16 words that she used that
I have never heard before.

328
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:11,917
Perspicacious?

329
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:14,128
17 words that I have never heard before.

330
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,609
My god, she's smart.

331
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,635
She is smart. She's Anthony Michael
Hall in "Breakfast Club" smart.

332
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:20,403
I'm very proud and mystified.

333
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:22,371
Well, me, baby, all me.

334
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:24,183
Oh, it's my new nanny.

335
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:26,089
Oh, does Sienna know about this?

336
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,103
Actually, this is the fourth
new nanny in six months.

337
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:31,259
I'm telling you, pickings are slim out there
for someone decent to look after your kid.

338
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,638
That's why they invented parents.

339
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,698
Ah, crap, she can't work Sunday.

340
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:35,952
What's going on Sunday?

341
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,939
I promised my mother I'd take her to the
cemetery to visit my dad's grave.

342
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,425
And I'm thinking it might not be
the thrill for G.G. that it's
gonna be for the rest of us.

343
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:44,150
Not without noisemakers, it won't.

344
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:45,663
This single parent stuff.

345
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:46,705
Fun, huh?

346
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,677
I tell you, I can't wait till G.G.
starts school.

347
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:51,152
G.G.'s starting school? You're so old.

348
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:52,186
Where is she gonna go?

349
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:54,901
Not sure yet.
These snotty private schools are impossible.

350
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:57,325
There are waiting lists
and psychological tests

351
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:01,165
and blood samples and sworn oaths
and dark back-room promises,

352
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,561
and every single headmistress
looks like Dick Cheney.

353
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:05,009
You can always send her to public school.

354
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,148
Yes, I could, if I wanted to kill my mother.

355
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:09,483
Well, you will be at the cemetery tomorrow.

356
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:10,728
Lor.

357
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:14,335
You know, if you're ever stuck and
you need somebody to watch her,

358
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:15,761
I'd be happy to fill in.

359
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:16,462
Really?

360
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:18,042
Yeah, I'm fun. I like teletubbies.

361
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:19,125
Sober?

362
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,483
I have got plenty of Rory's
old books and games,

363
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:23,295
and I'm totally at your service.

364
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,578
Okay, well, I just may take you up on that.

365
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,580
Good.

366
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,602
So, what does "perspicacious" mean?

367
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:31,555
I don't know. "Persp"-- to perspire?
Am I close?

368
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:33,107
Close enough for me.

369
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,483
# So, that's right,
dude meet me at the bleachers #

370
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,955
# No principals, no student teachers #

371
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:47,704
# Both of us want to be the winner #

372
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:49,785
# But there can only be one #

373
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:51,922
# So, I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all #

374
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:54,438
# Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you #

375
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:56,279
# That's right, I'm the last one standing #

376
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,341
# Another one bites the dust #

377
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:00,450
# A few times I've been around that track #

378
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,690
# So it's not just gonna happen like that #

379
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:04,835
# I ain't no hollaback girl #

380
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,962
# I ain't no hollaback girl #

381
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:08,984
# A few times I've been around that track #

382
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:11,085
# So it's not just gonna happen like that #

383
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:13,312
# 'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl #

384
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,854
# I ain't no hollaback girl #

385
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:19,757
# Ooh, ooh, that's my shh
that's my shh #

386
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:23,842
# Ooh, ooh, that's my shh
that's my shh #

387
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,193
# Ooh, ooh, that's my shh
that's my shh #

388
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:32,419
# Ooh, ooh, that's my shh
that's my shh #

389
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:34,754
# Ooh, ooh #

390
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:40,778
Thank you, everyone.

391
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:45,395
That's our Bat Mitzvah girl Julia Lowman's
favorite song in the world,

392
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:46,806
and I can see why--

393
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:50,549
because it's full of strong female attitude,
which I dig.

394
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,209
Let me tell you, Julia,
guys are turned on by that.

395
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,738
Don't think they aren't.

396
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:56,952
They like girls with legs and brains,

397
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:59,734
like smart biker chicks, you know?

398
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:02,054
So keep on the path you're on,
keep up with school,

399
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:04,290
and, baby, you're going places.

400
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:08,591
I see the cake coming out of
the kitchen, everybody,

401
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,220
so we're gonna break for a couple
minutes to sugar up.

402
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,670
Back in a few.

403
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,341
Hey, guys.

404
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,409
I think you used too much whammy
bar during "my humps."

405
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,941
I was out of control.

406
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:22,645
So, you guys aren't gonna talk to me?

407
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:23,888
What's there to talk about?

408
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:27,666
Yeah, man. You're way deep in my bogus bag,
and it's ziplocked shut.

409
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,362
Well, you guys sounded great.

410
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,021
Yeah, I get what you're saying.

411
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:33,787
It's a west Hartford Bat Mitzvah,
not the Albert Hall.

412
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:34,863
Well, a gig's a gig.

413
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:36,578
Totally. A gig's a gig.

414
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,226
This crowd is lucky. I'm telling you,
it was tight.

415
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:41,379
You could've played that at the Albert Hall.

416
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:47,665
So, uh,
I reached a new level on Soulcalibur III.

417
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:48,587
Uh-huh.

418
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:49,970
Level 50 assassin.

419
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:50,718
Really?

420
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,688
Yeah, I just low-kicked through and
chalked up a mess of perfects.

421
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:55,463
You're gonna take the swordmaster
mantel soon.

422
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,475
But you're, like, the original swordmaster.

423
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:58,664
I beat the last boss.

424
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:00,575
Hit him middle, high, middle,
low, middle, high.

425
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:02,127
Took forever to figure out all his specials.

426
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,530
I know.
I was sitting next to you when you did it.

427
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:05,636
It was awesome.

428
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:10,588
Listen, this thing with
us-- I want to fix it.

429
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,342
It's too late.

430
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:14,890
It's not. Look, I know I was an idiot.
If I could turn back time, I would.

431
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:17,240
Oh, hey, "turn back time." We
should add that to the set.

432
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,898
Cher is always a slam dunk.

433
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:20,606
I want to get the band back together.

434
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,478
We were going somewhere, you know?

435
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:25,164
About to play for a label, and, well,

436
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,504
I miss you guys.

437
00:17:27,543 --> 00:17:32,002
I don't mean to get all "Brokeback Mountain"
on you, but we're buds, you know,

438
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:34,930
and I miss you,
and you're not gonna believe it,

439
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:38,527
but that kid over there is about to down
a whole cup of maraschino cherries.

440
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,398
That's Aton, the feldmans' boy.

441
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:41,831
He's gonna do it, man.

442
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,086
He's gonna do it.

443
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:45,539
He did it!

444
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:47,156
I didn't think he had it in him.

445
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:49,486
He is gonna be puking.

446
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,992
So, what do you say, guys?
You want to re-form Hep Alien?

447
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,681
Maybe, if you can get Lane.

448
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:54,614
She'll never come back.

449
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,398
Leave Lane to me. I'm gonna reason with her.

450
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:57,691
Well, if Lane's in, I'm in.

451
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:58,790
Me, too.

452
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,629
Hep Alien has got to rock again.

453
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,720
Cool.

454
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,378
It's time for the big one.

455
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,283
- Let's do it.
- Kick ass, guys.

456
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:11,639
All right.

457
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,059
Let's bring this whole mishpachah
down to the dance floor,

458
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,832
'cause it's time to rock-a-dila!

459
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,790
# Hava nagila, hava nagila #

460
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,327
# Hava nagila, venis'mecha #

461
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:30,855
# Hava nagila, hava nagila #

462
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:34,376
# Hava nagila, venis'mecha #

463
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:37,536
This place is like a labyrinth.

464
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:40,682
Well, if you get lost,
keep your hand on the wall and keep walking.

465
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:42,840
Eventually, you'll find your way
out or get eaten by a minotaur.

466
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:43,600
Thanks, chum.

467
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:44,823
Josh, my man, what's going on?

468
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,178
My cuff links have been stolen.

469
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:47,873
Don't worry. I'm good at finding things.

470
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:50,615
At Easter-egg hunts, they used to make me
wear an eye patch to keep things fair.

471
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,201
Okay, but I suspect thievery.

472
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,087
You'll be okay hanging out
by yourself for a while?

473
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:55,878
For at least a fortnight. I'm good.

474
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:58,035
Now go, put on your eye patch,
and find some cuff links.

475
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:58,946
I'll see you later.

476
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:00,992
Come on, Josh. Dead man walking!

477
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:02,802
Excuse me. I'm trying to find the library.

478
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:05,044
- Oh, sure, it's in the east wing.
- Rory!

479
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,544
Oh, hey, bride. You look beautiful.

480
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,267
You like my wedding sweats?

481
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:11,515
I think Town & Country might not approve.

482
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:12,255
How are you doing?

483
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:14,708
Okay. You have to come back and hang
out with me and the bridesmaids.

484
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:16,905
Oh, that's sweet, but I can't.
I actually have all this work.

485
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,377
Ladies, come on. Makeup time.

486
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:21,260
And whoever took Josh's cuff links,
hand them over.

487
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:24,064
Look, the girls have cracked
open a case of champagne.

488
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:26,335
I need you to be my designated dresser.

489
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:28,684
I'm the bride. You can't say no to a bride.
It's bad luck.

490
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:30,075
I guess I can do my work tomorrow.

491
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,671
That's always been my motto. Come on.

492
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,823
All day, if anyone does something I don't
want them to, I'm saying it's bad luck.

493
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:37,187
I swear, getting married is so fabulous!

494
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:41,602
Everybody, so, this is my lovely friend Rory.

495
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:43,746
Rory is gonna hang out with
us while we get ready.

496
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,070
Some of you might have met at the shower,

497
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,894
but this is Alexandra, Walker, Megan,
and Claude.

498
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,902
- Hi.
- Hi.

499
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:51,453
Welcome to the final hours
of Honor's maidenhood.

500
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:54,645
Yeah right, Honor's maidenhood didn't
make it to upper school at Brearley.

501
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:56,789
Not true. Turks and Caicos-- 1996.

502
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,607
Anyway, we're here to celebrate
these last precious hours

503
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:00,453
before we lose Honor to the dark side.

504
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:03,534
And to celebrate, we drink booze.

505
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:06,087
Not me. I'm having one glass
right before the ceremony.

506
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,660
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

507
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:08,826
Ooh, I love that dress, Rory.

508
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:09,496
Oh, thanks.

509
00:20:09,497 --> 00:20:10,395
Is that Carolina's?

510
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:11,998
Um, no, it's mine.

511
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:14,806
Oh, Rory, this is Italo.
Italo's a total genius.

512
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:16,862
If they gave MacArthur grants for hair,
he'd get one.

513
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:19,431
Okay, girls,
I need to get you in these chairs pronto.

514
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:20,655
Bridezilla?

515
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:22,918
Okay, but just one now and one
right before the ceremony.

516
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,326
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

517
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:25,612
I need it to make a toast.

518
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:29,617
To friends-- old and new, borrowed and blue.

519
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:30,872
You guys are awesome.

520
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:31,731
- Yay!
- Yay!

521
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:35,441
To Honor and to Honor's honor.
The missing maidenhood.

522
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:41,676
- Hi.
- Hey.

523
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:42,515
What's all this?

524
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:46,037
G.G.'s pillow.
Here's her blanket and duvet cover.

525
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,664
What-- no mattress and box spring?

526
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,299
She never goes anywhere without
her duvet cover.

527
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,131
She calls it her scrunchy-bunchy because
she likes to scrunch it...

528
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:53,638
And bunch it. I get it.

529
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:54,796
Did you forget the kid?

530
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:57,949
Oh, uh, G.G? Come on, honey.

531
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,926
What's she chasing?

532
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,288
Oh, that's a cat.

533
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:02,812
Just so you know, that cat bites, scratches,
and sprays,

534
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:04,041
and I'm pretty sure it's in heat.

535
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:06,740
G.G? Come on, sweetie. Right now.

536
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,891
Hey, kiddo.
I'm so excited to hang out with you today.

537
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:12,876
G.G., you want to give Lorelai a hug?

538
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:14,321
No!

539
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,973
G.G., please come back here
and pick up your jacket.

540
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,501
G.G?

541
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:25,755
Thanks again for doing this.
I really appreciate it.

542
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:27,139
Please. I'm looking forward to it.

543
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,229
I managed to find uno and checkers

544
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,608
and also parts of battleship and most
of the pieces of Candy Land,

545
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:35,985
which I figure we can mix together
to create a fabulous new game--

546
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:38,556
Candy Ship Battle Land.
War never tasted so good.

547
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:40,396
Okay, then. Well, I'm off.

548
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:41,987
Go. Get out of here.

549
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:49,896
You already figured how to turn on the TV on?
You smarty.

550
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:52,125
So, what are we watching?

551
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:53,607
Shh!

552
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,827
"Shhhhh-indler's list"?

553
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,916
Oh, "Full House."

554
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:03,309
You know, I think the Olsen twins weigh
less now than they did on that show.

555
00:22:04,982 --> 00:22:06,115
Right. I get it.

556
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,094
I don't like it when people talk to
me when I'm watching TV, either.

557
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:10,483
Okay, so I don't look obese?

558
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:11,465
You look like a Skeleton.

559
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,239
A beautiful, blushing Skeleton.

560
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,194
Whoa.

561
00:22:14,195 --> 00:22:15,378
What?

562
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:18,909
All of a sudden the idea of marriage
seems totally archaic and insane.

563
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,948
Legally binding one woman with one
man until they die? It's perverse.

564
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:24,902
Why on earth do people do this?!
Why am I doing this?!

565
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:26,154
Uh-oh. Freak-out.

566
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:27,789
You love Josh, remember?

567
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,401
Oh, yeah, Josh.

568
00:22:30,402 --> 00:22:31,621
Okay.

569
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:33,183
Okay, freak-out over.

570
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:34,842
I wonder if Josh is freaking out.

571
00:22:34,843 --> 00:22:37,051
We saw him before we took a smoke break.
He looked nervous.

572
00:22:37,052 --> 00:22:39,325
Oh, adorable.

573
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:40,889
Hey, can someone check my sling-back?

574
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,371
It feels messed up,
and I can't reach my own feet.

575
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:43,663
Certainly.

576
00:22:45,284 --> 00:22:47,787
Oh, yes,
the sling-back is not slung back properly.

577
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:50,991
I think I can remedy this if
I just sling this back.

578
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,926
Did that get on my dress?

579
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:56,059
Someone tell me if I need to freak out.

580
00:22:56,548 --> 00:22:57,694
It's fine.

581
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:00,885
Get away from me, you lousy drunk.

582
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:03,650
Hey, that's offensive. I'm a terrific drunk.

583
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,084
I need my designated dresser.

584
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:06,406
At your service.

585
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:09,471
Make sure it's secure because
I plan on dancing tonight.

586
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,010
Speaking of dancing, has anyone warned Rory

587
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:15,198
about the quote-unquote "dignitaries"
coming to the shindig?

588
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,716
It's always the same cold brits.

589
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:17,559
I need warning?

590
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,991
The ambassador from Luxembourg
is very handsy.

591
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:22,338
No, you have to watch out for is that poet.
What's his name?

592
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:23,518
The dude with the red face?

593
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,197
He just did a translation
of the "Bhagavad Gita."

594
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:27,979
Anyway, he acts like he's gay,
but it's such a ruse. Total perv.

595
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,104
Poet, red face, not gay,
"Bhagavad Gita," perv. Got it.

596
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:33,941
I'm going to steal the bride to
take a couple quick pictures.

597
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:36,323
Honor, honey, grab your veil.
The rest of you-- 3-minute warning.

598
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:39,046
See you soon, everybody.

599
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:40,639
Head that way, toward the sitting room.

600
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,551
We don't want Josh to see you in your dress.
It's bad luck.

601
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:44,575
Please. Like I care about things like that.

602
00:23:46,242 --> 00:23:47,525
I look like a drag queen.

603
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,530
My hair is insane.

604
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:52,223
I want your hair.
My hair looks like Lynda Carter's.
Italo was punishing me.

605
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:55,051
I'll tell you what I want-- I want
to hook up with someone tonight.

606
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:56,527
Just remember that pinning guys in the corner

607
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:59,126
and shoving your tongue down their throats
can sometimes come off as desperate.

608
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:00,431
But I am desperate, I swear.

609
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:02,911
I might go home with the ambassador
from Luxembourg.

610
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:05,645
Come on. There'll be plenty of
eligible bachelors tonight.

611
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:06,341
Like who?

612
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:08,018
The groomsmen, for starters.

613
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,356
Tripp Wallison is looking good.

614
00:24:09,357 --> 00:24:10,397
You always think he's looking good.

615
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:12,140
'Cause he always is. Anyway, so do you.

616
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,554
Alexandra and Megan have
both slept with Tripp.

617
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,433
Small world.

618
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:16,249
I'm with Liam.

619
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,128
You can have Tripp.

620
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:19,765
Tripp's too short. I'm over the whole
Mia Farrow/Woody Allen thing.

621
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:21,081
How about Josh's brother?

622
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:22,976
Poor man's Josh? Really poor man's?

623
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:24,738
He's the Josh they give away
at the soup kitchens.

624
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:25,876
Oh, there's always Logan.

625
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:27,159
Been there, done that.

626
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,415
Shush!

627
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,184
What "shush"? You should talk.

628
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:32,341
Rory is Logan's girlfriend.

629
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,376
Oops.

630
00:24:33,377 --> 00:24:35,445
Oh, my god, you're Rory-Rory.

631
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:36,938
I'm so retarded.

632
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:38,883
Don't worry.
This was way before you guys started dating.

633
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:41,103
This was back around Thanksgiving.

634
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,259
Last Thanksgiving?

635
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,042
It meant nothing. Believe me-- meaningless.

636
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:46,611
Walker will have sex with anyone.

637
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:47,277
I will.

638
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,691
And I'm sure you know Logan and I dated,
but that was ages ago,

639
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:52,910
eons, back when he drove a z3.

640
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,150
And then we had a stupid one-night
stand this December,

641
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:57,023
but there's nothing between us, I swear.

642
00:24:57,024 --> 00:24:59,385
We're just friends who drank
too much spiked eggnog.

643
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:02,049
And now he's met you,
and you guys are so great together. Really.

644
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:02,859
Thanks.

645
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,520
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you slept with Logan.

646
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:06,094
I thought you two just messed around.

647
00:25:06,095 --> 00:25:07,820
No, you said you just messed around with him.

648
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:10,263
I said that he and I hooked up.
I meant hooked up-hooked up.

649
00:25:10,264 --> 00:25:12,170
I thought you just meant hooked
up like messed around.

650
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:14,694
How come you never told me you messed around
with Logan? Why am I not in the loop?

651
00:25:14,695 --> 00:25:15,715
I'm with Liam.

652
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,382
Officially, nothing happened.

653
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,273
These shoes are killing my feet.

654
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:22,562
Just scrunch up your toes a little bit.
That's what I'm doing. It feels good.

655
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,729
Did you hook up with Logan
around Thanksgiving?

656
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,056
No way.

657
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,373
I was in Biarritz.

658
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:29,783
Okay, ladies, time to line up.
The processional is about to start.

659
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:31,195
Rory, you better go find your seat.

660
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,266
I look like Rupaul.

661
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:34,494
Where's my flowers?
Does Sofia have the flowers?

662
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:35,948
See you at the party, Rory.

663
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:39,131
Oh, just FYI-- before I
got together with Liam,

664
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:41,806
he slept with half the upper east side,
and now he's loyal as a dog.

665
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,411
I need my flowers.

666
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:46,174
Oh, I already have my flowers. Oops!

667
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:47,984
- Bye, Rory.
- Bye, Rory!

668
00:25:53,865 --> 00:25:57,001
I don't know how you did it, kid,
but every single thing I own

669
00:25:57,002 --> 00:26:00,161
is now broken or missing.

670
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,402
Oh, G.G., hon,
you're coloring on the floor there.

671
00:26:02,403 --> 00:26:06,168
It's not enough the paper's near the marker.
It has to actually be under it.

672
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:09,160
G.G., give me-- oh,
that's a permanent marker, honey.
Give me that.

673
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:10,566
- No!
- Yes.

674
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:12,255
Permanent marker causes permanent damage,

675
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:14,450
which makes auntie Lorelai
permanently bitter.

676
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:15,679
No!

677
00:26:15,702 --> 00:26:16,881
G.G.

678
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:23,141
Oh, my god! God, give me that.

679
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,963
Okay, if that's your Donald Sutherland
"Invasion of the body snatchers" impression,

680
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:28,610
it's a really good one.

681
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,666
"I'm sorry, ma'am,
those tonsils are gonna have to come out."

682
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,707
G.G., please, if you stop,

683
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,565
I'll give you one of those caramel
apples that I showed you, okay?

684
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:42,341
They're delicious,
but to get one you have to stop

685
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:46,134
making the world's most annoying
noise in 5, 4, 3, 2...

686
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:48,238
Thank you.

687
00:26:48,288 --> 00:26:51,686
Nothing a little eardrum replacement
surgery won't fix.

688
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:53,278
Come on, let's go in the kitchen.

689
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:56,175
G.G? Hey, don't you go into Rory's room.

690
00:26:56,176 --> 00:26:57,627
You know you're not allowed in there.

691
00:26:57,628 --> 00:26:59,856
G.G? Hey, you.

692
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:04,681
I know this is a cliché,
but just wait till your father gets home!

693
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,194
Here you are.

694
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,478
Here I am.

695
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:10,875
I was looking all over for you.

696
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,580
I didn't see you when I was
walking down the aisle.

697
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,861
Looked for you during the ceremony.
Where were you?

698
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:15,914
Here.

699
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:18,207
Here? You missed the wedding?

700
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,853
I'll apologize to Honor later.

701
00:27:20,854 --> 00:27:23,033
Forget Honor. What's going on?

702
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,731
Rory.

703
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:28,165
You didn't say a word.

704
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:32,244
You just let me walk into a room full
of girls you'd had sex with.

705
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:33,850
Oh, no, wait. I'm sorry.

706
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:36,067
You only had sex with two of them.

707
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:39,036
One you just "fooled around
with," whatever that means.

708
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:42,188
She spared me the exact parameters of the
fooling around. You want to fill me in?

709
00:27:42,189 --> 00:27:42,843
Rory.

710
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:44,433
You know what? Never mind.

711
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:46,383
I've got a good imagination.
I can figure it out.

712
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:47,362
Okay, look.

713
00:27:47,363 --> 00:27:51,541
I can't believe it-- you didn't just cheat
on me, you really cheated on me.

714
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:52,544
I didn't cheat on you.

715
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,224
Oh, so you didn't sleep with--

716
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:55,989
No, I did, but we were broken up.

717
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,710
No, you were broken up, not me.

718
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,461
I thought we were just taking some time.

719
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:02,403
Apart, not seeing each other.

720
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:05,932
Yes, taking some time,
not seeing each other for a while.

721
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:07,351
That doesn't mean "broken up."

722
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,412
Oh, come on.

723
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:12,272
No! To break up,
you have to tell the other person.

724
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:16,318
You can't just decide that you're broken
off and then just go off and...

725
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,502
God, I can't believe I fell for
all your stupid tricks--

726
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:22,543
the coffee cart and going to my mother.
You went to my mother.

727
00:28:22,544 --> 00:28:25,884
Why would you bother going through that?
You had plenty of backup.

728
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:27,115
What do you need me for?

729
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:28,143
Because I love you.

730
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:29,485
No. Don't.

731
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:31,526
Rory, I didn't cheat on you.
I didn't lie to you.

732
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:32,494
You didn't tell me.

733
00:28:32,495 --> 00:28:35,444
Of course not. Why would I want you
to be hurt and upset and angry?

734
00:28:35,445 --> 00:28:36,757
"Blondie, dizzy"--

735
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,855
I love the cover, pretending all those
girls were worthless idiots.

736
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:42,730
They are worthless idiots, shooting their
mouths off in front of you like that.

737
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:43,944
It's not their fault.

738
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:47,452
It is their fault.
They love doing crap like this,
causing trouble.

739
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:50,172
We were only apart for like two seconds,

740
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:53,445
and you managed to sleep with every
one of your sister's friends.

741
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:54,640
How did you even do that?

742
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:56,596
I mean, did you work them in shifts?

743
00:28:56,597 --> 00:28:58,896
Were there charts, signals, b-12 shots?

744
00:28:58,897 --> 00:29:01,059
I was depressed. I was lonely. I was upset.

745
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,977
I've known these girls forever.
It was just companionship, okay?
It meant nothing.

746
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:07,699
Don't be at the apartment between 10:00 and
1:00 tomorrow so I can get my stuff.

747
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,054
What?

748
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,953
You're disgusting,
and you're cheating on your juice diet.

749
00:29:26,954 --> 00:29:30,444
I didn't cheat.
I expanded the definition of "juice."

750
00:29:31,193 --> 00:29:32,247
I feel dirty.

751
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:33,241
Hey.

752
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:34,573
We're out of food.

753
00:29:34,574 --> 00:29:35,264
What?!

754
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:36,570
I have to talk to you a sec.

755
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:38,240
I went to a Bat Mitzvah last night.

756
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,097
Mazel tov. You want some more coffee?

757
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:40,699
What the hell.

758
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,948
I talked to the guys.

759
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,433
I know you ripped my flyer down.

760
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:43,983
What?

761
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:46,584
My "drummer wanted" flyer at Sophie's,
it was ripped down.

762
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:50,287
And Lou said he saw you do it. I just want
you to know that I think that sucks.

763
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,976
Well, "A," Lou's a fathead, and, two,
I had my reasons.

764
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:56,278
Come on, Lane, stop. I have to talk to you.

765
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,477
About what?
What do you have to talk to me about, Zach?

766
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:02,428
I have to talk to you about how it's
all feeling wrong, you know.

767
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:06,714
I tried to write a song about it, and I was
gonna bring my amp and play it for you.

768
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:10,122
But it was coming out way too emo,
so I decided to just say it.

769
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,154
I get up in the morning
and I don't feel good.

770
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:14,815
I go to work and I don't feel good.

771
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:16,123
I come home and I don't feel good.

772
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:17,947
I brush my teeth and I don't feel good.

773
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:19,484
Then I go to bed and I don't feel good.

774
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,238
Then I wake up and I don't feel good.

775
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,004
And then I go to work and I don't feel good.

776
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,079
You don't feel good! We get it! Go on!

777
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,322
Hey, is something burning down here?

778
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:29,310
Luke, shh!

779
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:30,217
Okay, sorry.

780
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:31,320
Go on.

781
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:32,360
Right.

782
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:33,523
Where was I?

783
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:34,964
Oh, yeah.

784
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:38,733
Lane, will you marry me?

785
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:40,224
What?

786
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,970
Will you marry me?

787
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:44,584
But... do you even know what you're saying?

788
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:46,788
I mean, have you even thought about this?

789
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:50,580
Oh, my god, you have thought about this.

790
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:52,219
I got it at the pawn shop.

791
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,535
It belonged to like an elk
or a moose or something.

792
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:58,608
But it looked cool, and I could afford it,
so I got it.

793
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:03,037
You're smiling.

794
00:31:03,088 --> 00:31:04,278
I know.

795
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:06,005
Does this mean yes?

796
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:10,724
Yes. It means yes.

797
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:11,883
Really?

798
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:13,443
Cool.

799
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,746
For God's sakes, kiss him, sugar!

800
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:19,670
Yeah, kiss him, sugar!

801
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:33,435
So... I should get back to work.

802
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:36,797
It's okay. I wasn't thinking the ceremony
should be today or anything.

803
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:37,756
I'm off at 8:00.

804
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:39,065
I'll swing by.

805
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:44,653
I'm getting married.

806
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:45,975
I heard.

807
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:09,661
Hey.

808
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,005
Hi, Mary Poppins.

809
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:13,166
Sorry, the place is a mess.

810
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,312
It's okay. I left my white gloves at home.

811
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:17,222
So, how'd it go with you today?

812
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:18,172
Great. I got everything done.

813
00:32:18,173 --> 00:32:19,958
It was actually nice spending
some time with my mom.

814
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:20,507
Good.

815
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:22,303
So, what-- you lose my kid?

816
00:32:22,304 --> 00:32:23,473
Should I call the milk carton people?

817
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,816
Oh, she's asleep in Rory's room.

818
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:27,305
She's all tuckered out, huh?

819
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,976
Yeah, either that or she knocked herself out.

820
00:32:29,977 --> 00:32:32,377
She was throwing books around Rory's room.

821
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:33,877
What do you mean?

822
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:36,621
Well, when she was done drawing on the floor
and pouring chocolate milk on Paul Anka,

823
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,044
then she took to throwing
books around for a while.

824
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:41,571
This was before the spitting
and the furniture kicking

825
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:44,986
and the grand finale where she pulled
all the sheets off the bed

826
00:32:44,987 --> 00:32:46,599
and tried to flush them down the toilet.

827
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,296
You're kidding.

828
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:48,685
Oh, I'm really not.

829
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:50,363
Well, she's a spirited kid.

830
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:52,971
Spirited, possessed. Potato, po-tah-to.

831
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,548
3-year-olds can be a lot to handle.

832
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:57,220
If you're not used it,
I'm sure it can be overwhelming.

833
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:00,068
Oh, no, no,
this wasn't 3-year-old hard-to-handle.

834
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:03,222
This was feral hyena hard-to-handle.

835
00:33:03,223 --> 00:33:04,946
So, you guys didn't click.

836
00:33:05,209 --> 00:33:09,114
Chris, this is not about clicking.
This is about spoiled.

837
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:10,383
Spoiled?

838
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:13,571
Yes, G.G. has clearly never heard
the word "no" in her entire life.

839
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:14,878
She's heard the word "no."

840
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:18,270
Well, at no time did me saying "no" elicit
anything other than a scream.

841
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:20,710
I said,
"no coloring on the floor"-- she screamed.

842
00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:23,557
I said,
"no pulling Paul Anka's tail"-- she screamed.

843
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:26,526
I tried discussing Japanese noh
theater with her. She screamed.

844
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:27,326
So what?

845
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:29,191
I'm not saying it's her fault.

846
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:32,759
I'm just saying I think you could
apply a little more discipline.

847
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,745
She's a kid. Kids are hard.

848
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,957
Yeah, I know kids.

849
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,009
I raised one, okay?

850
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,670
Kids are different today.
It's a different world.

851
00:33:40,671 --> 00:33:42,460
They need more nurturing, more space.

852
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:46,922
I'm sorry. Uh, yes, that was
Dr. Spock turning over in his grave.

853
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:48,478
We're going.

854
00:33:49,436 --> 00:33:51,997
Come on, Chris. It isn't just me.

855
00:33:51,998 --> 00:33:53,397
Those preschool interviews?

856
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,988
Those people don't know what
they're talking about.

857
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:55,897
And the nanny?

858
00:33:55,898 --> 00:33:57,260
Is a flake.

859
00:33:57,956 --> 00:34:01,124
You know, giving G.G. whatever she wants

860
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:04,460
isn't gonna make up for Sherry being
a crappy mom and bailing.

861
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:07,941
You know what?
I've had enough of your advice and your help.

862
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,883
Hit me, barkeep.

863
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:17,729
That's your third one.

864
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,758
What are you, my mother?

865
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:19,266
No.

866
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,937
No, you're not.

867
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:24,120
I'm not driving, and I live right over...

868
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,452
there, or somewhere near there.

869
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:29,479
Or there.

870
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:32,896
But it's close, and I'm walking,
and I want another drink.

871
00:34:32,897 --> 00:34:34,030
Okay.

872
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:37,971
Hey!

873
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:39,391
These are mine.

874
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:41,500
I was just gonna get them out of your way.

875
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,447
Don't take what's mine.

876
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,303
These came with my drinks.

877
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:47,317
He put them down in front of me.

878
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,971
I did not ask you to move them, did I?

879
00:34:48,972 --> 00:34:50,140
Whatever.

880
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:52,887
Snappy comeback.
Dorothy Parker know about you?

881
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,197
Sick of people touching my stuff.

882
00:34:55,198 --> 00:34:56,488
Here you go.

883
00:34:57,992 --> 00:34:59,299
Eat something.

884
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:01,312
You eat something.

885
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:17,287
Well, hello, Rory. Fancy meeting you here.

886
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:18,636
Hi, Doyle.

887
00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:21,388
I didn't see you sitting here,
or I would've come over sooner.

888
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:22,778
I've been here a while.

889
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:26,173
I've been mixing beer and
wine and Malibu rum.

890
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,659
That sounds bad.

891
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,285
Yep, it is bad.

892
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:31,577
It's been a long, bad night.

893
00:35:31,578 --> 00:35:32,766
How about you?

894
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:33,747
How's your night been?

895
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:34,807
Really excellent.

896
00:35:34,808 --> 00:35:37,260
Okay, well, then,
let's drink to really excellent evenings.

897
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,658
To really excellent evenings.

898
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:44,938
Paris threw me out.

899
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:47,151
What? No. Why?

900
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:51,863
I told her you were thinking of making
her Campus safety piece a series
and that I told you not to.

901
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:53,127
But why would you do that?

902
00:35:53,128 --> 00:35:55,852
I don't know. It just came out.
We were fighting.

903
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,887
She was miserable and not sleeping

904
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:01,851
and just sitting at that craft table,
hot-gluing bead after bead after bead.

905
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:04,895
And then when I tried to take the glue gun
out of her hand, all hell broke loose.

906
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,069
Oh, boy.

907
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,433
She kicked me out, told me to leave.

908
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:09,652
I came here.

909
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:11,140
That sucks.

910
00:36:11,141 --> 00:36:12,631
I drank a lot.

911
00:36:12,649 --> 00:36:13,982
Love sucks.

912
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:15,639
Went and bought a car for that woman.

913
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,263
Me too.

914
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:17,507
Now I have to move out.

915
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,602
Me too.

916
00:36:18,603 --> 00:36:19,786
You too, what?

917
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:21,767
I have to move out of Logan's apartment.

918
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:22,958
Why?

919
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:28,406
Because Logan had many,
many blondes for thanksgiving.

920
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,377
Sounds terrible.

921
00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:31,928
Did you love him?

922
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,316
Yep.

923
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,880
It's terrible when you love 'em.

924
00:36:36,284 --> 00:36:37,982
I don't know where I'm gonna go.

925
00:36:37,983 --> 00:36:42,367
I'm staying with two guys who have
black-light posters on every single wall.

926
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,494
It's depressing.

927
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:45,476
You guys will get back together.

928
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,757
You and Paris are perfect for each other.

929
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:49,529
I mean, there's socks hanging everywhere.

930
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,862
I don't even know if they're clean socks.
They're just hanging.

931
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:55,492
I wonder what Paris is doing now.

932
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:59,254
I wonder how long till Logan
sleeps with somebody else.

933
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:01,911
Bet he already has.

934
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:07,811
Ohh, empty. Sad.

935
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:09,010
How we doing?

936
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:10,160
Fine.

937
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,354
We're fine.

938
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:12,900
I want to die.

939
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:14,221
I want more. You want more?

940
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:15,438
Uh-huh.

941
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,445
Oh, rats. I'm out of money.

942
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:22,410
I had to take a cab back from New York,
so of course I have no drinking money.

943
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:23,673
I've got money.

944
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,564
It's in something in my pants,

945
00:37:25,565 --> 00:37:28,800
somewhere down here in this general area.

946
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,449
I'll hold still while you look.

947
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,969
No, that's okay. I'm gonna go.

948
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,473
Yeah? Okay.

949
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:34,972
I'll go, too.

950
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:39,165
Oh, bad move.

951
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,578
Bad, bad move.

952
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:42,072
Come on. I got you.

953
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,683
Doyle, use your feet.

954
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:49,830
It's cold.

955
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:50,838
I'm cold.

956
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,499
- You want my coat?
- Okay.

957
00:37:58,539 --> 00:37:59,782
This is lovely.

958
00:37:59,783 --> 00:38:00,852
Thank you.

959
00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:03,818
Okay, well, thanks for the company.

960
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:04,730
Yeah, you too.

961
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:06,512
- Bye, Rory.
- Bye, Doyle.

962
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:16,012
Uh, Doyle? Doyle, what are you doing?

963
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:17,206
You were kissing my neck.

964
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:19,885
Oh, god, I was. I was kissing your neck.

965
00:38:19,886 --> 00:38:21,389
And I was nuzzling, too.

966
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,901
There was definitely nuzzling.

967
00:38:22,902 --> 00:38:24,888
I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me.

968
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:26,111
And you used your tongue.

969
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:28,083
I just miss her so much.

970
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:29,248
Doyle, go home.

971
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:30,168
I don't have a home.

972
00:38:30,169 --> 00:38:31,341
Yes, you do.

973
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:35,236
You have a home with black-light
posters and dirty socks.

974
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:36,876
I don't have a home.

975
00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:38,423
Oh, right.

976
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:39,795
Night, Doyle.

977
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:44,127
Oh, my god, could this day get any worse?

978
00:38:49,348 --> 00:38:50,312
Yeah?

979
00:38:50,313 --> 00:38:51,493
Lor?

980
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:54,267
Ah, well, if it isn't Da Vinci's daddy.

981
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:55,278
How's the floor?

982
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:57,180
Very festive.

983
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:59,821
I'm sorry about that.
I'll have a floor guy come fix it.

984
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:02,383
Well, don't worry about it.
The house was too perfect.

985
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:03,917
Now it's lived-in.

986
00:39:03,918 --> 00:39:05,586
Yeah, well...

987
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,743
You're awfully quiet.

988
00:39:09,744 --> 00:39:11,361
G.G. got a gun on you or something?

989
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:12,585
I'm sorry, Lor.

990
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:13,758
Oh, Chris.

991
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:15,358
I was so far out of line.

992
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,673
Don't worry about it.

993
00:39:16,674 --> 00:39:20,432
Everything you said, you were so right.

994
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:21,707
I hate when that happens.

995
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,834
G.G. is completely out of control.

996
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:26,322
I can't say no to her. I'm just--

997
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,041
I'm just so...

998
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,402
I don't know. I'm so mad at Sherry
for taking off like that.

999
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,951
I mean, who leaves a kid?

1000
00:39:32,952 --> 00:39:33,695
Well...

1001
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:36,173
Yes, I know. I left a kid.

1002
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:39,038
I tell you, Lor, I don't think I really
got how you felt about me until now

1003
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,896
because I want to kill Sherry.

1004
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:42,678
I never wanted to kill you.

1005
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,647
I wanted to key your car-- which I did once,
by the way.

1006
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:47,509
It's not right that G.G. doesn't get a mom.

1007
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,854
It's not right that all she has is me.

1008
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:51,592
What a super bargain that is.

1009
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:53,018
Oh, Chris, come on.

1010
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:54,865
I don't want her to feel like
she's missing anything.

1011
00:39:54,866 --> 00:39:56,215
I want her to be happy.

1012
00:39:56,216 --> 00:39:56,835
I know.

1013
00:39:56,836 --> 00:39:59,225
I can't get her into a school.
No one will take her.

1014
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:01,635
They say she's uncontrollable and aggressive

1015
00:40:01,636 --> 00:40:04,526
and all sorts of other horrible-sounding
terms.

1016
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,014
Well, school is overrated.
Ask Abraham Lincoln.

1017
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:08,260
I suck as a dad.

1018
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:09,550
No, you don't.

1019
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,401
Look, I get the single-parent guilt,

1020
00:40:11,402 --> 00:40:14,401
but in the end, G.G. needs you to say no.

1021
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:15,933
I know. I've ruined her.

1022
00:40:15,934 --> 00:40:18,139
You haven't ruined her. It's not too late.

1023
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,843
You sure?

1024
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:21,202
I'm positive. You can turn this around.

1025
00:40:21,203 --> 00:40:25,375
I know you can.
You're a great guy with a great heart.

1026
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:27,405
You just need to be a little tougher.

1027
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:28,219
Yeah.

1028
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,882
I'll help you in any way I can.

1029
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:32,030
I promise.

1030
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:33,496
We'll fix this.

1031
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,588
You're amazing, Lor.

1032
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:36,505
Only in the true sense of the word.

1033
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:37,673
Thanks for being around.

1034
00:40:37,674 --> 00:40:38,910
Any time.

1035
00:40:42,124 --> 00:40:45,382
- I got to...
- I know. Go.

1036
00:40:58,316 --> 00:41:00,387
Get the bowls and chopsticks out, guys.

1037
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:02,175
Somebody pick a movie already.

1038
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,250
I thought you were Hing Yee's.

1039
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:07,511
Sorry.

1040
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:08,924
What do you want?

1041
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:10,949
Can I talk to you for a sec?

1042
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:14,090
Fine.

1043
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:21,963
Where is everybody?

1044
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:23,555
I ordered food for 10,

1045
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:27,108
and I didn't want the delivery guy
to look at me like I was a hog.

1046
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,793
I don't need to display my
patheticness to the world.

1047
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:31,500
You're not pathetic, Paris.

1048
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:32,801
Doyle and I broke up.

1049
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:35,757
I know. I sort of ran into Doyle earlier.

1050
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:36,463
Oh, yeah?

1051
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:38,523
Yeah. He looked pretty upset.

1052
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:39,307
I don't care.

1053
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:40,247
Okay.

1054
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,949
So, is that why you came over here--

1055
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,844
'cause you heard that we broke up?

1056
00:41:44,845 --> 00:41:48,122
Well... yes.

1057
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:50,555
You're a really good friend.

1058
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:52,109
Oh, not really.

1059
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,377
I throw you out, I treat you like dirt,
no one else can stand me,

1060
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:57,834
but you come over to make sure I'm all right.

1061
00:41:57,835 --> 00:41:59,522
Well, Paris?

1062
00:41:59,523 --> 00:42:00,750
Yeah?

1063
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:04,290
In the name of full disclosure,
I should tell you--

1064
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:07,016
Logan and I broke up, too, today.

1065
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:08,289
I'm moving out.

1066
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,190
How come?

1067
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:11,095
He cheated on me...

1068
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:13,598
with an entire wedding party.

1069
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,704
Oh.

1070
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:16,653
Nice.

1071
00:42:16,654 --> 00:42:17,931
Yeah.

1072
00:42:18,263 --> 00:42:19,460
Men suck.

1073
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:21,067
They do suck.

1074
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:22,851
Can't count on them.

1075
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:24,103
They never have your back.

1076
00:42:24,104 --> 00:42:25,213
No, they don't.

1077
00:42:25,214 --> 00:42:28,279
They make you love them,
and then they let you down,

1078
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,872
and you're walking around with a stomachache
for the next six months.

1079
00:42:30,873 --> 00:42:31,980
Is that how long it lasts?

1080
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:33,176
I don't know.

1081
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:34,607
I hope it's only six months.

1082
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:35,941
Yeah, me too.

1083
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:39,714
You can stay here-- you know, if you want.

1084
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:40,688
Really?

1085
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:41,651
Sure.

1086
00:42:41,652 --> 00:42:44,405
Take my room if you want.
I've been sleeping at my crafts table lately.

1087
00:42:44,406 --> 00:42:45,555
Thanks, Paris.

1088
00:42:45,556 --> 00:42:46,645
Sure.

1089
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:47,856
Hungry?

1090
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:48,861
I got food coming.

1091
00:42:48,862 --> 00:42:50,251
Starving.

1092
00:42:50,256 --> 00:42:51,868
Hey, I just realized--

1093
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,732
when the food arrives, now I really
can ask someone to get the bowls.

1094
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:57,872
Silver lining, huh?

1095
00:42:57,873 --> 00:42:59,214
Sure is.

1096
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:02,822
Hello?

1097
00:43:02,823 --> 00:43:03,914
Hey, it's me.

1098
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,670
Hey, you! How was the wedding?

1099
00:43:05,671 --> 00:43:08,033
Sucko. I've got a new address for you.

1100
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:09,200
Uh-oh.
