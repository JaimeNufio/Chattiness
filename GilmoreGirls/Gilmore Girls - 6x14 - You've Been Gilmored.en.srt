1
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:07,441
The roses are amazing, mom.

2
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:08,712
Thank you, Lorelai.

3
00:00:08,827 --> 00:00:10,206
I like them, too, grandma.

4
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:11,116
Thank you, Rory.

5
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:14,317
You are an expert flower arranger, Emily.
Perhaps you missed your calling.

6
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:15,168
Thank you, Richard.

7
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:17,209
Well done, everyone. Well done.

8
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:18,370
Oh, stop it, Lorelai.

9
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:21,763
What? I'm just commenting on how
nice and civil that moment was.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,593
Never mind. Go on, go on.

11
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:24,879
That was so cute.

12
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:29,618
The roses are nice, grandma.

13
00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:31,078
Already covered that. Move on.

14
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:34,896
So, Rory, how are things going at Yale?

15
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:35,727
They're fine.

16
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:37,320
I didn't know we were allowed
to talk about Yale.

17
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:37,881
Mom.

18
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:40,090
Oh no. We're allowed to talk about it.

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,593
We're just not allowed to pay for it.

20
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,093
Dad...

21
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:43,512
I wonder if we're allowed to visit it.

22
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:44,471
Okay, hold on.

23
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,117
Perhaps if we dress in disguise.

24
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:46,764
Guys!

25
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,599
Plastic nose with glasses attached.

26
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,747
Hey, come on.
We were doing so well there for a while.

27
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:52,256
Then you had to start with the Yale.

28
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:53,574
So we can't talk about Yale.

29
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,965
I should make a list. What else am I
not allowed to discuss in my house?

30
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:58,665
No, of course you can talk about Yale.

31
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:02,742
Yale is dad's alma mater,
and Rory goes there,
so we have to talk about it, okay?

32
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:03,989
But maybe not now.

33
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,651
Fine.

34
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:05,486
Fine with me.

35
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:07,001
Now, I know a lot of stuff has happened,

36
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:10,158
but we all agreed we were gonna put all
that behind us and just move on, okay?

37
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:14,386
So let's take a step back and, uh,
start again.

38
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:18,110
And 5, 4, 3, 2...

39
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,139
These roses are amazing, mom.

40
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,113
Thank you, Lorelai.

41
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:22,063
Thatagirl.

42
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:23,814
Your mother has a way with flowers.

43
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:25,345
Perhaps she missed her calling.

44
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,243
Okay, Dad, we don't have to have exactly
the same conversation we just had.

45
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,727
How am I supposed to know?
You said the same thing you said.

46
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,023
I was getting the ball rolling.

47
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:33,524
Lorelai, this is my house.

48
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,853
I should have some control over what
goes on here at some point!

49
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:38,262
You're raising your voice again, Richard.

50
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,125
I am not!

51
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:41,471
You are, and you're raising your voice to me.

52
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,882
Well, I'm not allowed to raise it
to the people who deserve it.

53
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,754
5, 4, 3, 2...

54
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:47,763
I love shrimp! Who else loves shrimp?!

55
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:48,272
Me!

56
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,114
I'm a fan!

57
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,239
This is ridiculous.

58
00:01:50,348 --> 00:01:51,483
Lorelai, how's Luke?

59
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,692
Hey, nice one, mom.

60
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:53,686
Thank you.

61
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:55,808
Well?

62
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,652
What? Oh. Oh, he's fine.

63
00:01:57,746 --> 00:01:58,633
So you're still engaged.

64
00:01:58,726 --> 00:01:59,957
Yes, we're still engaged.

65
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:03,457
I was just asking. After all,
I haven't gotten a "save the date" card yet.

66
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,297
If you're engaged, I assume you're
planning a wedding at some point,

67
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:07,397
not that I've heard anything.

68
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,316
I will send you a "save the date" card, mom.

69
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:10,165
For?

70
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:10,865
For?

71
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:11,827
What date am I saving?

72
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:15,664
Well, if I tell you that now,
then what fun will the card be?

73
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:18,321
I mean, I assume I'm invited.
I haven't heard.

74
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:21,732
I haven't heard if I'm invited,
if I'm in the wedding, if I need a dress.

75
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:24,905
And now you won't tell me the date of this
wedding that I may or may not be invited to.

76
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:26,070
June 3rd!

77
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:29,047
- June 3rd?
- Yes, June 3rd, okay?

78
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:30,218
Are we here June 3rd?

79
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:31,443
I believe we are.

80
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:33,429
All right. June 3rd.

81
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:35,049
That's very soon.

82
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:35,885
Yeah.

83
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,503
Is there any specific reason so soon?

84
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,398
Oh, boy.

85
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:39,359
June 3rd.

86
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:41,648
June 3rd? Richard, June 3rd.

87
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:42,873
Yes, June 3rd.

88
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,556
Well, it's just so soon.

89
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,201
I mean, we haven't even seen Luke since...

90
00:02:47,762 --> 00:02:49,477
Richard, when was the last time we saw Luke?

91
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:50,387
It's been a while.

92
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:51,727
A long while.

93
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:53,752
Well, you must bring him to dinner Friday.

94
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:54,392
What?

95
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,325
Well, the next time we see
him certainly cannot be

96
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:57,632
as you're walking down the aisle.

97
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:00,002
- Well, there's time before--
- No, there's not.

98
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,698
Your father goes out of town every other
week from now until the end of may,

99
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,314
I have functions every weekend--

100
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:09,222
two charity balls, the zoo auction,
the Hartford beautification project.

101
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:10,910
Your father and I bought a
stretch of the highway.

102
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:12,913
Exit 36 through 38.

103
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:15,495
So there's literally no time left.
It has to be Friday.

104
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:16,496
Friday it is.

105
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:18,089
I don't know if Luke is available Friday.

106
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,274
- Tell him he has to be. This is family.
- Yeah, but--

107
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:23,919
He would say no to having dinner with
his future mother-and father-in-law?

108
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:26,240
Is this really the kind of
man you want in your life?

109
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,206
Is this really the kind of man you
want to be Rory's stepfather?

110
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:30,730
Yeah, think of the kids.

111
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:31,857
Luke is not saying no.

112
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,517
You are?

113
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:34,045
No, I'm not saying no, either.

114
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,316
- So no one's saying no.
- Right.

115
00:03:35,398 --> 00:03:37,141
- So you're saying yes.
- Yes.

116
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,909
Good. I'll pick up some "save
the date" cards tomorrow.

117
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:42,767
Do you want a color?
Because I think white is the best choice.

118
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:45,166
5, 4, 3, 2...

119
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:44,227
Hey, have you noticed that anything
in a red-wine reduction sauce

120
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:45,728
leaves you hungry 20 minutes later?

121
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,515
Especially if you don't eat it.

122
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,835
Did my parents eat exceptionally
slowly tonight?

123
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,268
- Yes.
- They did.

124
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:54,376
My mother started on the white-meat
portion of her game hen at 8:15

125
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:56,459
and did not hit the drumstick
till 10 of 9:00.

126
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:57,929
Actually, 9:15!

127
00:04:58,027 --> 00:04:59,567
You've been in there an hour.
What are you doing?

128
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:02,833
Facial exercises. The younger I look,
the younger you look.

129
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:04,263
Oh, good point.

130
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:07,191
Hey, do we want the apple
turnovers or the cherry?

131
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:08,183
Yes.

132
00:05:08,353 --> 00:05:09,857
Hey, question--

133
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:11,857
where did June 3rd come from?

134
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:12,564
What?

135
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,366
I thought there was no June 3rd.

136
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,700
No, there's a June 3rd.

137
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,439
Just because we don't get married on a
date doesn't make it cease to exist.

138
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,441
You know what I mean.

139
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:20,896
I was on the spot.

140
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,365
I just didn't want to go through the whole
"the wedding was postponed" explanation.

141
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:25,048
Why not?

142
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:28,561
Because that would lead to the
"what happened?" conversation,

143
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:30,544
which would lead to the "I
told you so" conversation

144
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:34,080
and the "what is wrong with you that you
can't close the deal?" conversation,

145
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:38,212
which would lead to the "why is Lorelai
slamming her head against
the wall?" conversation.

146
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,847
So I just said June 3rd.

147
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,617
It could still happen, and if it doesn't,
I'll blow up that bridge when we come to it.

148
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:45,030
- I get it.
- Thank you.

149
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:46,498
- Those new sweats?
- Yep, just came out.

150
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,252
- Did you get some for mommy?
- You want some Yale sweats?

151
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:49,743
No, no, not me, your other mommy,

152
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:51,752
the one who raised you and fed you

153
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:53,461
and stayed up with you when
you had the measles.

154
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:54,723
I already put them in your room.

155
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,096
Excellent!

156
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,810
- To cleanse your palate.
- Thank you.

157
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:58,949
Let's go.

158
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,332
Hey, you know who also might
like a sweatshirt?

159
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:05,718
They don't make them for dogs.
I already asked.

160
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:07,324
I did not mean Paul Anka.

161
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,433
He's a Princeton man, anyhow.

162
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,616
Nice loyalty.

163
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,476
I think Christopher might like one.

164
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,587
Dad? Really?

165
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:15,567
Yeah, he's paying your tuition now.
It might be a nice gesture.

166
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,041
Yeah, sure, I could do that.

167
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:18,507
Cool. "Solaris"?

168
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:19,593
No, not again.

169
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:21,445
I'm telling you,
there's a story in there somewhere.

170
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,430
Yeah, the story is you calling yourself
Mrs. Clooney for 2 1/2 hours.

171
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,483
Have you heard from him lately?

172
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:29,311
George? Yes, last night.
The Oscar buzz is really getting to him.

173
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,017
- I'm talking about your dad.
- No.

174
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:31,968
Huh.

175
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:32,801
What?

176
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:34,412
Nothing. He's just been very quiet lately.

177
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:35,020
So?

178
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:36,377
So it's weird.

179
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:38,531
Pops up and then disappears
again-- that's never good.

180
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:40,680
Unless he's a groundhog.
Maybe dad's a groundhog.

181
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:42,016
I wonder what he's up to.

182
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:43,508
Maybe he's just busy with work.

183
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,190
No, I don't buy it.

184
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:47,754
Maybe he's just doing what
he promised he would do.

185
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:48,561
What's that?

186
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,047
He's putting up the money and staying
out of everything else.

187
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:53,337
Hmm. Well, that was the agreement, wasn't it?

188
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:54,785
Yes, it was.

189
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:55,808
Huh.

190
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:58,227
Maybe he is just doing what we agreed to.

191
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,472
People change, and then they get
a nice sweatshirt as a treat.

192
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:01,796
Good for him.

193
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,681
Yep. Hey, "Bullets over Broadway."

194
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:04,707
"Don't speak."

195
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:05,887
If only.

196
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,157
Hey, you like me. Remember that.

197
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:11,103
Why don't you invite him to Yale for lunch,

198
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:13,480
show him around the campus,
make him feel daddy-ish?

199
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:15,640
- You think he'd like that?
- I think he'd love that.

200
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,454
Okay. I'll call him tomorrow.

201
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,851
- Just don't take him to the library.
- Mom.

202
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:22,615
Don't show him all your classes.
Don't make him touch the toe.

203
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:23,539
This is my tour.

204
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,024
I'm just saying,
if he passes out from boredom,

205
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:28,390
he's gonna be a lot harder to drag
around campus than I was.

206
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,862
Seriously, don't speak.

207
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:32,772
This is getting ridiculous.

208
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,507
Well, I'm completely out of suggestions.

209
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,202
How about we call her cellphone and
make up some kind of emergency?

210
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,341
Would that work?

211
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:41,411
Okay, hit me with it.

212
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:43,206
Big shock, it's about Paris.

213
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:44,319
What did she do now?

214
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:46,013
Nothing, it's what's been done to her.

215
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,150
The howell raines-ing is complete.

216
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:48,976
She's out?

217
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:49,809
The board has spoken.

218
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:51,084
More like screamed.

219
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:52,576
Oh, boy. How did she take it?

220
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:53,413
She hasn't.

221
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,072
She won't come out of her bunker.

222
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:56,297
She's been in there for hours.

223
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,866
Even Hitler came out every once
in a while to walk his dog.

224
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,110
I interrupted her highness
while she was on the phone

225
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:04,730
and got a 5,000-word lecture
on Robert's rules of order.

226
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:05,925
Well, she's got to be told.

227
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:07,210
Then she's got to come out.

228
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,218
Tear gas! Where can we find tear gas?

229
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,598
Or we could set off the fire alarm.

230
00:08:10,693 --> 00:08:12,665
Stand down, everyone. I'll tell her.

231
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:13,546
Really?

232
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:15,790
It's probably better that the
person delivering the news

233
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:18,231
doesn't chuckle with glee
while doing it, Bill.

234
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:20,207
I would not chuckle while doing it.

235
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:22,156
Oh, my god, that was completely inadvertent.

236
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,298
All right, I'm going in.

237
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,483
I know, Mr. Weisner.
It was a complete screw-up.

238
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,511
Here's what happened--

239
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:31,193
your ad ran with the phone number of the
beauty-supply-store ad from the next page.

240
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:34,100
That's why you're getting calls about
hair gel and moisturizers.

241
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:37,844
Anyway, I really want you to rest easy,
and I hope this does not interfere

242
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:41,277
with any financial contributions that you've
been generous enough to promise.

243
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:42,514
All right?

244
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,194
Thank you. Bye.

245
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,505
- This job is 24/7.
- Yeah.

246
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:49,345
It's not enough to put out a daily
paper about standing quality

247
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:51,859
without having to dodge complaints
from uppity alumni

248
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,831
calling over every little mistake.

249
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:57,096
Weisner threatened to withhold money he had
already pledged for the new computers

250
00:08:57,177 --> 00:08:58,805
because his ad was messed up.

251
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,353
I mean, can he even do that?

252
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:01,018
I don't know.

253
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,987
Do you want some soup?
I was just heating up some soup.

254
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:04,224
There's no ventilation in here.

255
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:05,956
- I'm careful.
- Right.

256
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:09,651
Uh, well, no, thank you.
I just came in here to...

257
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:11,060
I was just thinking...

258
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:12,191
Yeah?

259
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,751
- Five-plus years?
- Hmm.

260
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,268
That we've known each other,
that we've been friends. Five-plus.

261
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:20,586
That long? Wow.

262
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:22,152
Feels like forever ago to me--

263
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:25,909
Chilton, the day we met,
just a couple of rosy-cheeked kids.

264
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:29,366
My face inflamed easily back then-- too
many tomatoes and red peppers.

265
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:32,254
Got off to kind of a rocky start.
We were competitors.

266
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,438
I get that from my mother. She's part viking.

267
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:37,546
But eventually we became pals, good pals,

268
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:40,336
because we respected each other

269
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:44,256
and supported each other
in good times and bad.

270
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,973
Did I open this can today or yesterday?

271
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:47,945
This is a not-so-good time, Paris.

272
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:51,097
I know. If the hurricanes don't kill us,
the bird flu will.

273
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:54,279
I mean for you, here, at the paper.

274
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,332
The board voted you out.

275
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:58,775
Oh.

276
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:00,995
I see.

277
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:05,814
So it's over.

278
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:07,088
I'm sorry.

279
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:09,593
I just found out. I'm so sorry.

280
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:13,428
Well, it's not like I didn't have a
clue that that was a possibility.

281
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:15,400
It has been pretty tense around here.

282
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:18,729
So, are they all out there excitedly
awaiting my perp walk?

283
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:20,820
Oh, who cares? Who cares about them?

284
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,588
You don't perp walk. You're Paris Geller.
You walk tall.

285
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:24,707
You're better than all of them.

286
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:25,990
- Really?
- Definitely.

287
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:30,013
And this job, Paris,
being editor-- you don't need this,
this hassle.

288
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:31,557
- You're gonna be a doctor.
- Surgeon.

289
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:32,797
- And a lawyer.
- Judge.

290
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:35,719
That's a hell of a workload.
And the workload here, the indignities,

291
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:39,930
smoothing the ruffled feathers
of advertisers, covering
sports as if they matter--

292
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:43,890
you're exhausted, Paris, stretched thin,
eating soup out of a can.

293
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:44,969
Soup I don't even like.

294
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,725
This might not be such a bad
thing leaving this job, huh?

295
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:49,082
I am pretty tired.

296
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:50,496
You even look a little relieved.

297
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,890
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
give those people a perp walk.

298
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:54,305
Good. Good attitude.

299
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:56,531
Let's get out of this spider hole
and take care of this right now.

300
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:57,794
I am with you, friend.

301
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,529
You better shut off the hot plate.

302
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:00,539
Right.

303
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:08,616
Everyone, I have a little announcement,
so if you could gather around, please.

304
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:10,037
We have an issue.

305
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:13,379
You see, it has become increasingly apparent
that I have become the story

306
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:17,962
here at the Yale Daily News and that I have
overshadowed our journalistic efforts.

307
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:21,983
Well, I don't want to be the story at my own
newspaper, because then I'd be Judith Miller,

308
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,825
and I'd have to wear my bangs too
long and overdo my lipstick,

309
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:27,637
and I don't want that. I want to remain me.

310
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:32,078
So I am tendering my resignation as editor
in chief effective immediately.

311
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:36,389
In closing, I'd like to state that the Yale
Daily News has overcome numerous obstacles

312
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:39,512
in its august history and that
it will easily overcome this.

313
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:43,691
My resignation will be a loss, but it will
be a loss the Daily News can survive,

314
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,754
and it is a loss it must survive.

315
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,419
Good night and good luck.

316
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,773
- I don't want to go.
- Of course you don't.

317
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:08,200
Your parents are not warm people.

318
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,993
They were extras in "March of the penguins."

319
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,227
Maybe we could skip the drinks,
just have the dinner, and be done.

320
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,073
Ship the drinks, Luke,
you don't skip the one activity

321
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:16,661
that makes the rest of the evening
miraculously tolerable.

322
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:19,669
The drinks fortify us.
The drinks give us strength.
The drinks get us drunk.

323
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:21,550
Yeah, but they take forever,
and then I got to sit there

324
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:24,861
and talk to your dad about
stocks and literature

325
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,301
and watch it dawn on him
for the umpteenth time

326
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,658
that I don't know anything about
stocks or literature.

327
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:32,904
I mean, how many times can two people
have the same awful conversation?

328
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:36,300
Look, just repeat after me-- "this
is really great scotch, Richard."

329
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,510
And then, of course, there's your mother,
who hates me.

330
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:39,976
All the more reason to get a little soused.

331
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,182
We can drink in the car.

332
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,061
One of us has to drive.

333
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,545
Fine, you drink in the car,
I'll take five quick shots in their driveway.

334
00:12:44,658 --> 00:12:46,691
Look, I want to get out of there
as quickly as you do,

335
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:48,727
but we have to think a little
more pragmatically.

336
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,430
So when the dessert comes,
I will fake an attack of food poisoning,

337
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:53,141
and then you rush me to the car.

338
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,289
- That's your solution?
- Uh-huh, yes.

339
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:57,563
Fake stomach pain is my specialty--

340
00:12:57,668 --> 00:13:00,957
that and getting my fiancé to agree
to horrible things he hates.

341
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:01,980
6:00?

342
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,580
Wear something fetching.

343
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,154
What is Luke doing here?

344
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:08,322
Oh, he's making a few minor
repairs around the inn.

345
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,725
What about the handyman?

346
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:11,659
- Parker?
- Yes. I thought we liked him.

347
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:15,425
Yeah, we do, but Luke offered,
and he has his own tool belt,
and the price was right.

348
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:17,086
Oh, really? No charge?

349
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,792
No. Well, I did have to give him
a coupon for 100 free snuggles.

350
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:21,959
How adorable.

351
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:26,198
Yeah, and to tell the truth, Parker
always kind of turned up
his nose at my snuggle bucks.

352
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,672
So I guess this is how we're operating now.

353
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:29,354
How's that?

354
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,898
We've dispensed with hiring
professionals around here.

355
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:34,915
Maybe from now on,
my cousin Gert can do our accounting.

356
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,516
She's got her own calculator.

357
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:38,065
He's not performing open-heart
surgery, Michel.

358
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:41,073
He's just fixing a few things, for free,
saving me a little money

359
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,316
so I can do crazy things like pay people's
salary and heat the place.

360
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,163
Well, he's not doing a very good job.

361
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:48,889
That key rack is protruding way too far out.

362
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:52,364
It's going to wreak havoc on my french
cuffs every time I reach for a key.

363
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:53,784
Tell him how you like the hooks.

364
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:57,661
Oh, I'm supposed to just follow him around
all day, correcting his every mistake?

365
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:58,594
Absurd.

366
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,955
We will sit down and make a detailed
list of everything we need done,

367
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,049
and he can consult that.

368
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:04,188
Luke does not need a list.

369
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,806
What do you mean?
We always gave Parker a list.

370
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,749
Luke's got a sixth sense about these things.

371
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:10,603
He can spot a loose screw
from across the room.

372
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:14,060
He can sense when something needs to be fixed
before it's even broken-- it's spooky.

373
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,114
Well, I will do a quick
walk-through with him,

374
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,398
just to make sure his magical
powers are working.

375
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,629
Michel, there's no need for that.

376
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,554
You've got plenty to handle with all the
guests, and Luke's got it covered.

377
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:24,829
Left my sandpaper in the library.

378
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,251
It must be nice to have a man who isn't
ashamed of his own natural body odor.

379
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:34,176
Come on. I'm trying to be accurate.

380
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,485
There are no hanging chads, Bill.

381
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:37,586
Give us the count.

382
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:43,083
Okay, we've got 16 votes for Casey,
18 for Andrew, and 9 for Cathy.

383
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,628
I can't do this anymore!

384
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:45,865
We're never going to get a majority!

385
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:48,287
Let's just not have an editor.
We can run the paper by committee.

386
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:49,942
No one said this was going to be easy.

387
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:53,375
It's been three days of voting.
That's not an election, that's a sentence.

388
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,681
Maybe we should take a break.

389
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,109
No. No breaks.

390
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:57,961
This isn't est. We get to leave.

391
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,495
Well then,
maybe we should send out for coffee.
Who wants coffee?

392
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:03,190
No way! I'm so wired,
I'm jumping out of my skin!

393
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,518
We have three candidates and no consensus.

394
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:06,644
We're never getting out of here.

395
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,431
We need a new name.

396
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,034
I agree. We're not getting anywhere.

397
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:10,350
How about Gilmore?

398
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:11,173
I like that name.

399
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:12,018
I like that name.

400
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:13,689
Whoa, hey, I didn't mean my name.

401
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,222
Well, I'd vote for Rory before I'd
switch to Andrew. Sorry, Andrew.

402
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,237
And I'd vote for Rory before
I'd switch to Cathy.

403
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,030
Sorry, Cathy.

404
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:22,571
And I'd vote for anybody over Casey because
Casey's an idiot and didn't even show up.

405
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:23,395
He's in the back.

406
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:24,307
Sorry, Casey.

407
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,442
Got a statement, Gilmore?

408
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:27,100
No, um...

409
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:30,193
I'd just like to say I'm flattered,
and you're very kind.

410
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:33,864
Um, I did miss that semester,
so seniority's a question.

411
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,984
We're past taking seniority into account.

412
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:37,739
You totally bailed us out that night.

413
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:39,383
The paper wouldn't have gone
out if it weren't for you.

414
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,141
What's your hesitation? Is it Paris?

415
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:43,234
No, I'm not hesitating because of Paris.

416
00:15:43,337 --> 00:15:44,776
Then why are you hesitating?

417
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,976
I'm not.

418
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:47,163
I accept the nomination.

419
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:48,819
Please tell me we don't have to debate this.

420
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,950
What's the debate?
She's feeling pretty consensus-y to me.

421
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:55,334
All right.
All those in favor of Rory Gilmore as editor,
say aye.

422
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:56,547
Aye!

423
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:58,397
Sounds consensus-y to me.

424
00:15:58,634 --> 00:15:59,821
Congratulations.

425
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:03,062
Thank you, everyone. I won't let you down.

426
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:05,142
This is part two of the
financial-aid feature.

427
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,724
We need your okay before going to layout.

428
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:08,136
Good. I loved part one, by the way.

429
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:08,970
Thanks.

430
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:11,631
AP pieces.
We may need more filler than usual today.

431
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:12,688
Good. Thanks, Sheila.

432
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:14,946
These should probably come
first-- photo approvals.

433
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:17,900
Thanks, Joanie. And let Derek know that
I'm gonna need some space in editorial.

434
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:19,990
I want to write a little note
from me to the readers.

435
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,087
Will do.

436
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:46,488
Paris!

437
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,724
Doyle! Someone!

438
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,596
You dare show your face?

439
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,422
What is my stuff doing out here?

440
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:55,871
I'll prorate the utilities from
the time of eviction--

441
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:58,116
3:47 p.m., the third day of February.

442
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,042
Eviction?

443
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:00,571
Paris, why are you doing this?

444
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,965
Don't you play dumb with me.

445
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:02,887
Unchain the door.

446
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,971
This chain is here for your protection.

447
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,646
Krav maga, baby. When my enemies approach,
I'm trained to pounce-- it's reflex.

448
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:09,966
Paris, I'm not your enemy.

449
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,842
Oh, really?

450
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:13,460
Enemies move in silence and strike
when their prey is weakest.

451
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,796
Pretty much sums you up, doesn't it,
editor Gilmore?

452
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:17,591
That was not my doing. That was the board's.

453
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,955
As if you didn't lobby for it.

454
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,690
I didn't!

455
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,159
That secret meeting weeks ago at the pub
where you set the putsch in motion--

456
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,069
What happened?
There wasn't a beer hall available?

457
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:27,638
I did not set the putsch in motion.
I can't even spell "putsch."

458
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,474
Nice spin. Take it to "k" street.

459
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:31,921
I made you my number two,
and it went to your head!

460
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,692
You can't just kick me out like this!

461
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:35,994
There's a hallway full of
crap that says otherwise!

462
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,126
But we're friends.

463
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:38,455
We're not friends.

464
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:41,778
I understand why you're upset,
but just let me in so I can explain.

465
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:44,610
"Gee, Paris,
what a horrible job being editor is.

466
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:45,726
Who needs the headache?

467
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,373
Remember Chilton, Paris?
All those good times."

468
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:49,964
Well, the good times are over!

469
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,206
Here, this is yours, too.

470
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:00,911
Luke, can we talk for a minute?

471
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:01,771
Yeah, what's up?

472
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:03,301
- I noticed your truck.
- Yeah.

473
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:05,356
Your filthy green truck.

474
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:07,592
- It's parked in guest parking.
- So?

475
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:10,115
So guest parking is for guests.

476
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:13,920
Filthy-green-truck parking is around the
back, on the dirt road, behind the shed.

477
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,192
I'll be done in two minutes.

478
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,341
Wonderful.

479
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:18,034
Now, about your hat.

480
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:18,692
My hat?

481
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:19,966
I'd like you to remove it.

482
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:21,760
- What for?
- You're indoors.

483
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,545
Gentlemen don't wear hats indoors.

484
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:25,086
It's okay. I'm not much of a gentleman.

485
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:28,195
Not if you persist in dressing
like a "peanuts" character.

486
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:29,669
I'm not taking off my hat.

487
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,614
Did you talk to a guest this morning?

488
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:32,248
Huh?

489
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:34,041
I thought I saw you talking to a guest.

490
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,007
I may have given someone directions.

491
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:37,737
Well, don't do it again.
You're not qualified.

492
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:40,133
I'm not qualified to tell somebody
how to get to the post office?

493
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,230
No.

494
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:45,051
You are a diner owner and an
amateur substitute handyman,

495
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,327
and that in no way qualifies you to
give directions to our guests.

496
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:48,962
Why not?

497
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,744
Because that is my job,
and you lack my people skills!

498
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:53,940
Go away, Michel.

499
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:57,226
Keep your voice down. The guests can hear.

500
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,334
There isn't anyone down here.

501
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,529
But they are upstairs,
and your voice carries!

502
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:01,858
Hey, you're the one doing the yelling.

503
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,933
I'm yelling because you are flouting
the rules of this establishment--

504
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:08,223
parking where you want,
talking when you want, wearing what you want.

505
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:11,135
And 20 minutes ago,
I saw you eating a sandwich.

506
00:19:11,228 --> 00:19:11,768
So what?

507
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:13,961
We don't let the help eat
in front of the guests!

508
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:16,757
The next time you eat,
you do so in the kitchen...

509
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:17,706
or the barn!

510
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:18,771
I'm not gonna eat in the barn!

511
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,665
Parker ate in the barn.

512
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,251
Who's Parker?

513
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:24,398
A wonderful, wonderful man.

514
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:30,628
Hello?

515
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:31,866
There are no singles left.

516
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:33,175
What do you mean "no singles"?

517
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:35,490
I just talked to campus housing,
and there are no singles left

518
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:37,675
at Branford or anywhere on campus,

519
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,551
and the decent off-campus
apartments are long gone.

520
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,355
The ones left make Paris and Doyle's
place look like Versailles.

521
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,263
What do you talking about?
Why do you need a place?

522
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,748
I got elected editor of the Daily News.

523
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:48,845
What?

524
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:49,968
You did?

525
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,107
Yes.

526
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:54,485
Wow! Finally someone good running that place!
Someone great! You're gonna be great!

527
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,697
Well, hot-plate Harriet took it very badly.

528
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,101
- Who's that?
- Paris.

529
00:19:58,204 --> 00:20:00,159
She threw all my stuff out into the hallway,

530
00:20:00,245 --> 00:20:03,399
so I'm sitting here guarding it
all until the movers get here.

531
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,433
Oh, man. Paris, idiot.

532
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:07,111
My books look sad.

533
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:08,328
Can books look sad?

534
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,467
Look, we'll figure this out.
Now, you said you got movers?

535
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:11,813
Starving students.

536
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:15,014
How starving can they be if they can't
come for five hours after you call?

537
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,363
Plus, I heard the guy crunching
on something during our call.

538
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:18,461
Sounded like baked Lay's.

539
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,017
And you've got nowhere to go, right?

540
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:21,163
Right-a-mundo.

541
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,470
Well...

542
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,195
you can move in with me.

543
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,048
What?

544
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:26,405
Move in with me.

545
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,739
Paris' place is a hole anyway.
I never liked that you lived there.

546
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,255
And that doo-wop group downstairs,

547
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:32,101
I don't think they're an honest-to-goodness
singing group.

548
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,302
Logan, that's really sweet,
but I can't move in with you.

549
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,219
Why not? You're here half the time anyway.

550
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:39,300
You've already got two dresser drawers,
and right now,

551
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,581
for a limited time, I'll throw in three
more drawers and a set of ginsu knives.

552
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:43,260
Really?

553
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,371
No. I have no idea where to get ginsu knives.

554
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:47,137
It's kind of a big step, isn't it?

555
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:50,017
You need a place, I got the space.
It will be fun. Don't you think it'll be fun?

556
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:50,745
Fun?

557
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:53,363
Come on, ace. You know what I mean.
What do you say?

558
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:54,478
Well...

559
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:56,869
I might need just one more drawer.

560
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,957
I can put my socks in a
shoe box under the bed.

561
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,946
Is that a yes?

562
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:01,110
I guess that's a yes.

563
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:03,642
Good. I'm calling Colin and Finn.
They'll be right over to get your stuff.

564
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:04,153
Okay.

565
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:06,282
And no shoe boxes.
You're getting those drawers.

566
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:07,056
I'll take them.

567
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:09,847
Wait, wait! Hold on, I've got to take this.

568
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:13,200
Okay, get past the hamper,
veer left at the mirror.

569
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:15,510
Grab the large pipe on the wall
to get yourself to the desk,

570
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:17,981
which you can then go over or under.
I'll guide you from there.

571
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,038
Got a little snack there, Michel?

572
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:24,193
These are not a snack.
They are my 12 daily walnuts.

573
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,665
I hate to see you binging like this.

574
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:27,439
And now I've lost count.

575
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:29,613
Let's talk about your little
spat with Luke today.

576
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:30,874
What did he tell you?

577
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,097
He said you yelled at him.

578
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,628
Oh! What a crybaby.

579
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:38,677
He's not a crybaby. He doesn't like being
screamed at by people he's doing favors for.

580
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:39,923
Did you check his diaper?

581
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:42,639
Maybe he's just upset because you
forgot to change him today.

582
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:43,800
Now who's a crybaby?

583
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:47,532
I used to yell at Parker all the time,
and he never once came running to you.

584
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,173
What is this thing with you and Parker?

585
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:50,690
Did he save your life in Nam?

586
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:52,115
Parker is a professional.

587
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:56,923
Parker is a clumsy, forgetful, 65-year-old,
semi-lucid, not-that-handy handyman.

588
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:58,347
Luke wears a hat indoors.

589
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,213
So did Parker.

590
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:02,515
That was a wool-knit cap.
It's completely different.

591
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:03,763
So this is a hat thing?

592
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,696
I just don't like Luke's system.

593
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:08,373
He misses many things that needs
to be fixed-- many things.

594
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:09,760
Well, so jot them down.

595
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:11,281
That's not how we make the list.

596
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:12,865
- So type them up.
- No!

597
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:16,440
We make the list at Weston's over coffee.
That's what we do when we make the list.

598
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:19,130
We go once a month to Weston's together,
and we sit,

599
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:21,105
and we decide on the work for the handyman.

600
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:22,326
That's our thing.

601
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:26,070
We get very large coffees,
and we split a slice of red-velvet cake,

602
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,904
and we gossip, and I eat the whole cake,
and you never tell anyone.

603
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,613
Oh, Michel. I liked our trips to Weston's.

604
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:35,274
Oh, yes, that is what I do when
I like something-- I cut it
out of my life completely.

605
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:37,535
I didn't cut coffee with you out of my life.

606
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,524
Oh, then you just forgot?

607
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:41,633
How special those times
must have been for you.

608
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:42,734
They were special.

609
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:47,409
It's just been crazy around here, and, well,
it was nice to save a little money with Luke.

610
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:49,052
Money isn't everything, you know.

611
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:51,233
People come to work for more
than just the money.

612
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:53,441
Although my direct deposit was late again.

613
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:56,061
Maybe that's something you can finally
get around to looking into.

614
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:57,235
I will.

615
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:59,367
I guess you don't have to
write that down, either?

616
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:01,393
No one needs a list anymore?

617
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:02,896
These are candied.

618
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:05,176
Well... the real ones taste like cardboard,

619
00:23:05,272 --> 00:23:07,905
and the health benefits are the same,
except for the skin.

620
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:08,996
What are you doing this afternoon?

621
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:12,807
I'm going to yell at Doreen about the soap
spots on room 3's bathroom floor tiles.

622
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:16,112
Well, instead, how about if you
and I take a trip to Weston's?

623
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:18,339
We can make Luke a list over cake and coffee,

624
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:21,478
and we can throw around ideas about
improvements at the inn.

625
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:23,126
I do not need your pity cake.

626
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:26,534
It's not pity cake. It's red-velvet cake,
and it's delicious,
and I think we ought to eat it.

627
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,833
Although this time, you're getting
your own 'cause I am not sharing.

628
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,612
Well, I guess I could yell
at Doreen tomorrow.

629
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:33,854
Tomorrow seems like a fine
day to yell at Doreen.

630
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:35,655
- So Weston's?
- Weston's.

631
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:38,267
I was thinking maybe you could
have Luke wear a jumpsuit

632
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,477
when he's working around the inn,

633
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,985
you know,
the kind gas-station attendants wear.

634
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,091
Yeah, why don't we put a pin in that?

635
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:47,260
So far,
I have seen no one here smarter than you.

636
00:23:47,356 --> 00:23:48,348
You can tell that?

637
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:53,123
And I'm keeping track-- 566 people,
all inferior to you.

638
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,743
I don't believe it.

639
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:55,408
What?

640
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,749
Did you not see those two girls?

641
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:57,734
No. What?

642
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,374
They totally checked you out.

643
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:01,480
They did? Cool.

644
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:05,219
It's the same way with mom. I swear,
I hate having hot parents.

645
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:06,368
Sorry.

646
00:24:07,055 --> 00:24:11,400
Check it out.
I had him for microeconomics last year.

647
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,784
The currency must be more than fungible,
but also scarce.

648
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:16,113
Take our seashells example.

649
00:24:16,218 --> 00:24:21,154
While fungible, they exist in infinite
supply and so fail the scarcity test.

650
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:25,698
- Dad!
- Huh? What? Uh, uh, fungible?

651
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,178
Dad, that's a Nobel-prize winner.

652
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,826
- The dull dude?
- Shh!

653
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,818
He doesn't even own an iron.

654
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:32,967
I can't take you anywhere.

655
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:34,658
No, you can't, can you?

656
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:40,162
This where we're eating?

657
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:42,273
We don't have to.
I just wanted you to see it.

658
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:43,747
Well, I'll eat wherever you want to eat.

659
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:45,642
Okay. I know a cool spot.

660
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:49,271
And we've pretty much covered every
square inch of campus. So let's go.

661
00:24:49,383 --> 00:24:50,595
Hey, what about your place?

662
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,398
My place?

663
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,608
Yeah, I want to see it.

664
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:53,589
Why?

665
00:24:53,778 --> 00:24:57,125
Because I'm curious.
I want to see where my kid lives.

666
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:59,157
Well, it's pretty messy right now.

667
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,838
The lady who cleans my house
has to use a bulldozer.

668
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,578
Messy does not frighten me.

669
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:04,669
Okay.

670
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,165
But you've been warned.

671
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:07,487
Lead the way.

672
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:13,183
Man, did you see that lobby?

673
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:14,881
Um, yeah. Once or twice.

674
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:17,331
That was a lobby. And a doorman?

675
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:20,016
I'm slipping that guy a little something
extra to keep an eye on you, by the way.

676
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:21,085
You don't have to do that.

677
00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:24,117
Are you kidding?
I love slipping people money to do things.

678
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:25,874
We're here?

679
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:26,817
Yep.

680
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,328
You got a key or is it scanning
your retina for access?

681
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,584
Dad, I have to be straight
with you about something.

682
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:34,304
Oops.

683
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:39,321
No, it's just... today was a weird day.

684
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:42,922
It started really great, with me getting
voted editor in chief of my school paper.

685
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:46,103
What? You did? Oh, boy, Rory, that's amazing.

686
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:49,965
Thank you, it is. It's just, Paris,
my roommate Paris--

687
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:54,828
she was the editor, but when she found
out that I was made the new editor,

688
00:25:54,877 --> 00:25:56,165
she threw me out.

689
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:57,220
What?

690
00:25:57,384 --> 00:25:58,426
You want me to talk to her?

691
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:05,514
No, it's fine.
It's just that I had no place to go,
so I moved in with my boyfriend.

692
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:06,779
Oh.

693
00:26:06,935 --> 00:26:07,886
In there.

694
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:08,701
Your boyfriend.

695
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:09,761
You actually met him once.

696
00:26:09,854 --> 00:26:10,374
I did?

697
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:12,478
At grandma's vow renewal. He was the guy--

698
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,174
- Right.
- Yes.

699
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:16,425
- When I walked in, and you two--
- Exactly.

700
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:19,821
Okay, well, uh, why don't we open the door

701
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:23,877
so I can see what my daughter living
with her boyfriend looks like?

702
00:26:23,994 --> 00:26:25,080
Okay.

703
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:40,356
Hey.

704
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:43,505
Hi. I tried to call you to let you know we
were coming over, but you didn't answer.

705
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:45,036
- Right. Headphones.
- They work.

706
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:45,816
Sure do.

707
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:48,523
So, uh, Logan,
this is my father, Christopher.

708
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:49,413
Hi, good to meet you.

709
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:50,426
Actually, we've met.

710
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:51,308
I know.

711
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,565
Don't worry about it.

712
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:55,721
Wow, this is, uh, some spread.

713
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,001
Aw, thanks.

714
00:26:57,858 --> 00:26:58,877
You brought your dad here.

715
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:00,998
He wanted to see where I lived.
What was I supposed to do?

716
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:02,572
Yeah, but I need a little bit of a warning.

717
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:03,656
I tried to call you.

718
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,980
Should I put the headphones on?
'Cause I'm right here.

719
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:06,896
No. Sorry.

720
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:07,829
Yeah, sorry.

721
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,969
Look, I didn't mean to barge
in on you like this.

722
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:13,250
I just want to make sure my kid's got
a decent place to live, that's all.

723
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:15,409
Hey, so, how do you like the plasma?

724
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:16,376
Love it.

725
00:27:16,492 --> 00:27:19,095
Yeah, I'm thinking about getting
a 60-inch for the bedroom.

726
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,382
Well, I've got a great home-theater
guy if you need some help.

727
00:27:21,502 --> 00:27:22,627
I may take you up on that.

728
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:23,930
You want something to drink, dad?

729
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:25,704
Sure, I'll take a soda, if you got one.

730
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:26,924
Coming right up.

731
00:27:29,302 --> 00:27:31,342
Wow. That's a great view.

732
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:33,059
Yeah, that's the old campus over there.

733
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:35,224
Oh, me and the old campus go way back.

734
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:39,310
Is that... it is. That's Endicott Peabody.

735
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:42,324
Why do you have that? Are you a Groton man?

736
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:46,983
Was, briefly. I actually swiped that from the
headmaster's office on my way out the door.

737
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,384
I was kicked out of Groton.

738
00:27:48,484 --> 00:27:49,027
You're kidding.

739
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:51,438
Nope, did a semester at
St. Sebastian's after that.

740
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:53,568
I know several people who got kicked
out of St. Sebastian's.

741
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,249
My good friend Colin was actually banned from
coming anywhere within a 10-mile radius.

742
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,126
Impressive.

743
00:27:58,215 --> 00:27:59,690
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

744
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:02,710
After St. Sebastian's,
I went on to St. Cybill's.

745
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,371
I almost went there myself,
but I wound up at St. Mark's instead.

746
00:28:05,488 --> 00:28:06,488
How long you last there?

747
00:28:06,587 --> 00:28:07,266
About a week.

748
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,118
Yeah, they got quite the trigger finger
at St. Mark's. You ever do Deerfield?

749
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:12,861
Please, Deerfield's for amateurs.
I got kicked out of Rivers.

750
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,492
I didn't think Rivers kicked anybody out.

751
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,875
Neither did we, but Dean Eldon's Miata
in the bottom of Lake Rutherford

752
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:19,109
proved just the ticket.

753
00:28:19,194 --> 00:28:20,713
Rory, you got a good man here.

754
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:22,490
Interesting yardstick you're using.

755
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:26,119
Hey, listen, Logan,
we were just about to grab some dinner.
You want to come with?

756
00:28:26,212 --> 00:28:27,980
Oh, I don't want to intrude.

757
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:29,808
No, come. That would be great.

758
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:32,357
Okay, sure. Just let me grab my wallet.
I'll be right with you.

759
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,228
You're being nice to him.

760
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,457
He's a cool guy.

761
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:38,452
Listen, I haven't had a chance
to tell mom about this yet.

762
00:28:38,545 --> 00:28:41,106
It's not a big deal,
it just happened so fast, so...

763
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:41,519
I get it.

764
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:42,437
I'm gonna tell her...

765
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,742
- Okay, rich man's shoe.
- Where else?

766
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:48,068
- Rich man's shoe?
- Best burgers within walking distance.

767
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:50,386
We have very high culinary
standards here at Yale.

768
00:28:50,477 --> 00:28:52,661
Whoa, is that the new Xbox 360?

769
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:54,507
Okay, I'm totally moving in here with you.

770
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:56,999
Are you serious?

771
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:58,202
Just look at it as a challenge.

772
00:28:58,289 --> 00:28:59,966
There's 85 things on this list.

773
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:01,921
Actually, that last page
we did front and back.

774
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:02,715
Wow.

775
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:04,228
Yeah, I thought we'd make it an even 100.

776
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:06,058
"Regrout the tiles behind the sink basin."

777
00:29:06,154 --> 00:29:07,204
Long overdue.

778
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:08,453
How can you tell?

779
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:12,161
Well, if you slide on your back under
the sink and shine a flashlight up

780
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:14,763
into the area where the basin meets the wall,
it's really obvious.

781
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,735
What does "ODD" Mean?

782
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,367
"Only during the day."

783
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,143
Those are tasks we deemed too noisy for
you to do when guests are sleeping.

784
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:22,399
How considerate.

785
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:26,721
"Replace chocolate-brown contact paper
in kitchen drawers with cocoa brown."

786
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:28,382
Okay, that one I blame on
the second piece of cake.

787
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,861
There was a major sugar rush involved.

788
00:29:29,964 --> 00:29:30,826
I hate this list.

789
00:29:30,927 --> 00:29:33,039
I know,
but Michel and I made that list together,

790
00:29:33,135 --> 00:29:34,754
and we bonded, and that makes him happy.

791
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,947
I don't want to make him happy.

792
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,237
If Michel's happy, then I'm happy,

793
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:43,397
and then I take all that happiness and I give
it right back to you, tonight, in bed,

794
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:45,513
after you spend four hours with my parents.
What do you say?

795
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:47,220
Can't Parker do the list?

796
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:48,299
No.

797
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,435
Luke, you eat so little.

798
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,849
My motto is "everything in moderation."

799
00:29:58,972 --> 00:30:00,912
Smart. Very "walden"-esque.

800
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:03,951
But it's good, though. Everything's really
good-- the duck pâté especially.

801
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:05,026
Thank you.

802
00:30:06,031 --> 00:30:07,369
- Number three?
- Hmm?

803
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,179
The martini.

804
00:30:08,287 --> 00:30:09,434
It helps settle my stomach.

805
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,796
- Gin?
- Absolutely.

806
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,846
Helps counteract the oh-so-regrettable
shrimp I had for lunch today.

807
00:30:13,953 --> 00:30:16,779
Yeah, you mentioned that before.
The shrimp did not agree with you.

808
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,450
Might have to turn in early. Damn, that Al!

809
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:20,113
Al?

810
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,732
Al's pancake world, where I had the shrimp.

811
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,975
You ate shrimp at a pancake house?
Well, of course your stomach's unsettled.

812
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,255
You should drink club soda.

813
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:27,925
I think we have some at the house.

814
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:29,661
Yeah, might have to cut the
night a little short.

815
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:31,324
So you're living at Lorelai's house, Luke?

816
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:31,954
Mother!

817
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:32,948
Is that so private?

818
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,956
No, we're in the process
of consolidating things.

819
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:37,306
Consolidating your assets?

820
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:37,995
Right.

821
00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:39,061
Tricky business.

822
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:40,838
Is that house big enough for the two of you?

823
00:30:40,936 --> 00:30:42,866
I've remodeled a little, added some space.

824
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:43,792
Smart.

825
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:45,211
Yeah, well, we're smart today.

826
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:46,434
Except when you ate that shrimp.

827
00:30:46,522 --> 00:30:47,302
Yeah, that was dumb.

828
00:30:47,402 --> 00:30:49,423
You've updated your coverage, I assume--

829
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:51,347
let your insurance company know
about the improvements?

830
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,710
You're my insurance company, dad.

831
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:55,260
- For the inn, not your house.
- I haven't yet, but I will.

832
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:56,875
- You should do it soon.
- I'll do it tomorrow.

833
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,472
- If you're feeling okay.
- Right.

834
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:02,454
Better not wait. Small gaps in your insurance
coverage can lead to big mistakes.

835
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:04,377
Oh, I could tell you horror stories.

836
00:31:04,491 --> 00:31:05,476
Brian Hunter.

837
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:09,584
Yes.
He owned a home for 40 years-- huge mansion--

838
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:11,082
never updated his coverage.

839
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:14,638
One night, his trophy bimbo wife
got into a drunken snit,

840
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,183
lit a curtain on fire with
her marijuana cigarette,

841
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,714
and burned the place to the ground.

842
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,143
He couldn't afford to rebuild.

843
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,207
Lost his fortune, lost the bimbo.

844
00:31:22,322 --> 00:31:25,980
Now he sells sunglasses out of the back
of a van in California-- cheap ones.

845
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:28,280
Because he didn't update his coverage.

846
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:29,413
What about your diner?

847
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:30,214
What about it, dad?

848
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm just wondering if Luke's
insurance is up to date.

849
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,144
I'm sorry,
did you invite us over to sell us insurance?

850
00:31:35,237 --> 00:31:39,200
Because if you did, I'm going to insist on
seeing the complimentary desk calendar first.

851
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:40,722
I'm simply inquiring.

852
00:31:40,813 --> 00:31:43,358
I think I'm all up to date.

853
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:44,380
What company are you with?

854
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:47,155
North Trust Insurance.
I've known the guy a long time.

855
00:31:47,236 --> 00:31:48,804
Never heard of it. You sure he's legit?

856
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:50,997
Of course it's legit. Come on, dad.

857
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:54,498
Don't be naive. There are schemers
about preying on the naive.

858
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:55,492
John Kendall.

859
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,949
John was drinking at a party, met a fellow,

860
00:31:58,057 --> 00:32:01,715
switched all of his coverage to the guy,
wrote him a huge check on the spot.

861
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,422
Then he suffered earthquake damage,

862
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,595
and there was no record of
the insurance transaction.

863
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:06,427
It was a scam.

864
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,484
Now he's working at the gift
shop at the Grand Ole Opry.

865
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,455
Horrid music.

866
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:11,544
Sells cowboy shirts and toy banjos.

867
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:13,105
I've known my guy for a while.

868
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:15,168
You been to his office,
checked out his operation?

869
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,740
I just deal with him over the phone.

870
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,860
Ah.

871
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:18,936
What?

872
00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:19,942
Hubert Lansing.

873
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:23,280
Fell prey to a telephone scam
running out of Estonia.

874
00:32:23,397 --> 00:32:26,425
Took his life with a track-and-field
starter's pistol.

875
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,506
On your mark, get set, die awkwardly.

876
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,956
It's not funny, Lorelai.

877
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,522
The fact is,
both of you have significant assets,
and both of you are targets.

878
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,377
Targets?

879
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,811
How are we targets?

880
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:36,928
You own your home.

881
00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:38,583
So every homeowner is a target?

882
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:41,218
And an inn with a 26 zagat rating.

883
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:42,892
Okay, so that's two things.

884
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,607
Two very valuable things.

885
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:47,388
The Dragonfly is one of the highest-rated
places in the area.

886
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:49,684
And Luke owns his diner and
the building it's in

887
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:51,593
and the building next door
with the soda shop.

888
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:53,736
That's another significant holding.

889
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,084
Wait, did you put a PI
on our tail or something?

890
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,072
How do you know about Luke's
real-estate holdings?

891
00:32:58,168 --> 00:33:00,957
Because he told me all about them
when we played golf last year.

892
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:01,652
You did?

893
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,375
Yeah.

894
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,905
Who in the world would target us?

895
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:07,139
Grifters, con men. They know all the tricks.

896
00:33:07,257 --> 00:33:08,267
Joe Collins.

897
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:11,120
Oh, my god, the two of you have more
stories than Somerset Maugham.

898
00:33:11,218 --> 00:33:12,857
Well, your father has seen it all.

899
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:17,218
And I must say, your daughter coming
out of left field raised a red flag.

900
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:17,980
My daughter?

901
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,125
You think she's a grifter?

902
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:20,118
Of course not.

903
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:21,504
But the people around her could be.

904
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:23,603
It's just that the timing
is a little suspicious.

905
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,056
Right when Luke's about to
marry a woman of means.

906
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:27,281
I'm not a woman of means!

907
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:32,119
Stars Hollow real estate is skyrocketing.
It's gone up 43% in the last 4 years.

908
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:34,096
It has. I heard that, too. 43%.

909
00:33:34,182 --> 00:33:34,853
That much?

910
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:37,815
This daughter of yours-- you
saw substantiation?

911
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:39,314
Well, there was a DNA test.

912
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:41,565
That she performed herself,
as I understand it.

913
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:43,214
- Isn't that what you said?
- Yeah, but--

914
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:45,246
But her uncle helped her.

915
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:47,506
And he's authorized to perform
such a procedure?

916
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:48,304
I think so.

917
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:49,365
You never confirmed it?

918
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,549
I saw a picture of him, and he was standing
right next to a microscope.

919
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:56,909
Under the circumstances, I think it's best
to take every possible precaution.

920
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:58,358
For our protection, as well.

921
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,249
Your protection?

922
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:00,491
We're all connected now.

923
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:03,853
You're our daughter, and come June 3rd,
Luke will be our son-in-law.

924
00:34:03,953 --> 00:34:07,584
They could come after your assets,
then Luke's assets, then our assets.

925
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,571
We could be wiped out.

926
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,159
So this is about protecting you.

927
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,596
It's about protecting all of us.

928
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:13,028
We're all in this together.

929
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:14,328
All four of us.

930
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,268
Get dessert ready, Leticia.

931
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,221
- Who wants coffee?
- Hmm.

932
00:34:24,697 --> 00:34:26,078
I got to I don't know if I can drive.

933
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:26,954
Well, walk to the car.

934
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,800
Did you know real estate's gone up that much?

935
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,523
Not that much.

936
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:31,703
My shirt is soaking wet.

937
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,145
I got to start reading the business section.

938
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:35,943
I never knew there were so many horrible
ways you could lose everything you own.

939
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,948
Or con men. Con men!
Are there really con men?!

940
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:41,278
I thought they went the way of
vaudevillians and trotskyites.

941
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,694
You've got to double-- triple
insure everything you own.

942
00:34:43,787 --> 00:34:45,429
I've got to learn more about
umbrella policies.

943
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:48,020
Does Sookie know how much
the inn has appreciated?

944
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:48,841
I don't think so.

945
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:51,403
If they can come after her, they can go
after you 'cause you're her partner.

946
00:34:51,432 --> 00:34:54,497
Or, when we get married, they can come
after you because we're married.

947
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:57,460
And Sookie's married to Jackson,
so they could go after his
farm and all his equipment.

948
00:34:57,557 --> 00:34:58,662
Maybe I should sit down with Sookie.

949
00:34:58,755 --> 00:34:59,629
And I'll talk to Jackson.

950
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,907
Or maybe we could do it at the
same time because that way--

951
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:06,315
No, this is ridiculous.
This is what Gilmores do.

952
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:09,524
They get in your freaking head,
and they mess with it.

953
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:10,775
Oh, they're good at that.

954
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:13,600
Forget Sookie and Jackson.
They're responsible people. Dad does the inn.

955
00:35:13,686 --> 00:35:16,286
We're covered there. I just need to
talk to my homeowner-policy guy.

956
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:17,494
And I'll talk to my guy.

957
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:19,637
But in person, right?
You should see his office.

958
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:21,723
That's what the Hubert Lansing
story taught us.

959
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,389
Or was it John Kendall?

960
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,243
No, he's selling banjos in Nashville.

961
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:27,111
It was Hubert Lansing.

962
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,029
So, in person.

963
00:35:28,124 --> 00:35:30,435
Right. And I shouldn't worry about April.

964
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:30,938
No.

965
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:33,076
Because if I was a guy hearing a
story about what happened to me,

966
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:34,909
the timing would sound suspicious.

967
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:37,359
April's 12. She's not a con man.

968
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:39,104
Though I know nothing about her mother.

969
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,092
Anna's cool.

970
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:41,089
You know that for a fact?

971
00:35:41,193 --> 00:35:43,157
Absolutely. The timing was weird,

972
00:35:43,252 --> 00:35:46,970
but this woman is very down to earth,
very unmaterialistic.

973
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:50,505
I trust my gut,
and my gut says there's nothing bad there.

974
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:53,375
Okay, good. I trust your gut, too.

975
00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:56,802
Oh, I feel like I should run in there
and yell at them about something.

976
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:57,609
About what?

977
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,230
I don't know. That's what's stopping me.

978
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:01,204
What is this feeling,
this tightness in the chest,

979
00:36:01,301 --> 00:36:03,983
this anger mixed with paralyzing weakness?

980
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,329
You've been Gilmored.

981
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:09,838
But you know what the weird thing is?
They referred to us as family-- you, me.

982
00:36:09,928 --> 00:36:10,922
Yeah, what was that about?

983
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:13,051
Well, I think in some twisted way,

984
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,564
that may have been them actually
validating us as a couple.

985
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:17,213
Wow, that is twisted and weird.

986
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:17,966
Yeah.

987
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:20,345
Oh, well, I think I can walk now.
Can you walk?

988
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:20,996
Yeah.

989
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:21,993
All right.

990
00:36:22,754 --> 00:36:24,647
Why did she say June 3rd?

991
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,851
Oh, it's old information.
They're always a step behind.

992
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:28,866
Right.

993
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:31,386
Hey, which one was Somerset Maugham?

994
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:37,612
Hello?

995
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:40,399
Lor, it's me. You busy? Can you talk?

996
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,004
How come you have "I've got the government's
secret microchip in my briefcase,

997
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:45,419
- and they're on to me" voice?
- Do I? Sorry.

998
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:46,469
What's wrong?

999
00:36:46,632 --> 00:36:49,037
Nothing.
I just finished having dinner with Rory.

1000
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,783
Oh, yeah. How did the tour go?

1001
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:54,043
Did she take you to stare at the old
books? 'Cause that girl loves
staring at the old books.

1002
00:36:54,149 --> 00:36:56,615
Yes, we stared at the old books.
The tour was great.

1003
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:59,239
I just... I have to tell you something.

1004
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:00,174
Okay.

1005
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,212
Now, I'm not sure whether I'm
supposed to do this or not.

1006
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:04,704
Normally I wouldn't because it
feels like a fink-out thing,

1007
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,171
but I think this falls under the parent
thing, so that overrules the fink-out thing.

1008
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:09,764
Catch a wave, bud. You're drifting.

1009
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,832
Rory moved in with her boyfriend.

1010
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:12,502
What?!

1011
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:15,767
Rory moved in with her boyfriend,
and she said she was gonna tell you,

1012
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:20,634
but I thought, in case she didn't,
then I should tell you, so I did,
and I feel like a fink.

1013
00:37:20,724 --> 00:37:22,873
You're not a fink. When did this happen?

1014
00:37:22,955 --> 00:37:24,996
Today. It was all very spur-of-the-moment.

1015
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:26,504
Hey, tell me about this guy. Do we hate him?

1016
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:27,196
What?

1017
00:37:27,282 --> 00:37:28,888
Logan-- am I supposed to hate him?

1018
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:31,296
No, you can feel however you want about him.

1019
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:33,741
Good, 'cause I think I like him.
He's a cool guy.

1020
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,426
Great apartment. Funny.

1021
00:37:35,513 --> 00:37:36,459
He's taken, Chris.

1022
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:39,627
I just wanted to make sure you didn't hate
him before I committed to an opinion.

1023
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,574
You're entitled to your own take on him.

1024
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:42,416
What's yours?

1025
00:37:42,504 --> 00:37:46,061
Hey, for me, the jury's out on all you guys.
You can thank Brad Pitt for that one.

1026
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,498
Okay, so, anyhow, I told you.

1027
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:51,731
Yeah, you told me.

1028
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:56,202
Wow.
Our little girl is living with her boyfriend.

1029
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:57,668
Yeah, I had that moment, too.

1030
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,879
It was during the onion brick,
so I had a little distraction, but I had it.

1031
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:02,624
Yeah. Um, hey, hold on.

1032
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:04,118
Hello?

1033
00:38:04,212 --> 00:38:04,973
Mom, it's me.

1034
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:06,819
Hey, you. Hold on a sec.

1035
00:38:07,462 --> 00:38:08,367
Chris, it's Rory.

1036
00:38:08,465 --> 00:38:11,818
Okay, now, I did not tell you.
Do not rat me out.

1037
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:14,320
When she tells you the news,
you have to act surprised, okay?

1038
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,401
Yes, I promise.

1039
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,118
It'll be like the time you told me you got
Pat Benatar tickets for my birthday,

1040
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:21,320
but I knew because I went through your jeans
looking for the clove cigarettes.

1041
00:38:21,418 --> 00:38:22,142
You knew?

1042
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,413
Bye, Chris.

1043
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:25,700
Hey, kid, what's going on?

1044
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:28,157
Not much.
Having a bad reaction to an onion brick.

1045
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:30,071
What part of onion brick
do you not understand?

1046
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,477
I gave dad his tour today.

1047
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:32,243
Yeah?

1048
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,523
It was nice. He saw the campus,
we had dinner.

1049
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,469
Oh, how very "7th heaven" of you.

1050
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,551
Listen, I have some news-- two
pieces of news, actually.

1051
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:43,533
One is good, and one is,
let's say, interesting.

1052
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:44,982
Oh, intrigue.

1053
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:49,053
Well, first, I was made the new
editor of the Yale Daily News.

1054
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:52,030
No, really? Rory, that's awesome.

1055
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,031
It is awesome.

1056
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,145
My god,
I didn't even know you were up for the job.

1057
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:58,626
I wasn't, actually.
It all kind of happened at the last minute.

1058
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:01,823
Hey, wasn't Paris the editor
of the Daily News?

1059
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:04,878
Yes, she was,
which brings me to my next piece of news.

1060
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:05,793
Okay.

1061
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:09,871
Paris was ousted, and when she found
out that I had taken her place,

1062
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,709
she kind of kicked me out of the apartment.

1063
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:12,705
Well, sure.

1064
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:17,122
So I had no place to live, and there were
absolutely no apartments for rent

1065
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,096
anywhere near campus, so...

1066
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:21,045
I moved in with Logan.

1067
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:22,945
Wow, big news!

1068
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:23,858
Yeah.

1069
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:27,318
Well, jeez, tell me about his place.
Is it nice?

1070
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:30,111
Uh, yeah, it's really nice.

1071
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,149
Where is it?

1072
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:33,810
The Taft building, right off campus,
top floor.

1073
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,385
Top floor? Cool. Good view?

1074
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:37,264
Great view.

1075
00:39:37,362 --> 00:39:38,995
Awesome. How many rooms?

1076
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:40,122
Dad told you, didn't he?

1077
00:39:40,218 --> 00:39:42,219
Oh, come on, I was doing so well.

1078
00:39:42,303 --> 00:39:43,005
Please.

1079
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:44,290
How did you know?

1080
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:45,858
Are you kidding me?

1081
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,824
"How's the view? Is his place nice?"

1082
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,376
You didn't call me Hester Prynne once.

1083
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:51,718
Don't be mad at him.
He was just trying to do the dad thing.

1084
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:52,964
He hated it, by the way.

1085
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,756
- I'm not mad.
- Good.

1086
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:57,370
- So?
- So, what?

1087
00:39:57,457 --> 00:39:59,517
So, what do you think of
me moving in with Logan?

1088
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:01,680
I'm sorry,
do you remember what happened the last time

1089
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,943
I piped in with my opinions
on your life choices?

1090
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:04,851
Mom, come on.

1091
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:07,155
You don't want to make sure the
pool house is clean first?

1092
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:07,847
Mom.

1093
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,766
Okay, well, moving in-- that's pretty big.

1094
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:12,450
I know.

1095
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,563
I mean, I don't know.
I've never lived with a guy.

1096
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:18,119
There's that whole thing about
the cow and the milk's free.

1097
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:21,124
I guess I would hate to think that
you really moved in with him

1098
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:24,587
because there was a housing shortage,
because it's a big step.

1099
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:25,775
I love him.

1100
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,296
Well, I want you to be happy.

1101
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:29,474
I am happy, really happy.

1102
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:30,649
Okay, then.

1103
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:32,351
Congratulations.

1104
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:33,344
Big day.

1105
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:34,130
Thanks.

1106
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:37,405
You're gonna have to tell me how it is living
with a guy before I let Luke move in.

1107
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,420
If it's too creepy,
he may have to stay with Babette.

1108
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:40,327
I will.

1109
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:43,513
I've heard some horror stories about
toilet seats you would not believe.

1110
00:40:43,602 --> 00:40:45,073
Really? Do tell.

1111
00:40:45,183 --> 00:40:47,297
Oh, but, wait,
let me dim the lights and start the fire.

1112
00:40:47,388 --> 00:40:48,583
You have a fireplace?

1113
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:49,478
Wood-burning.

1114
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,219
I don't think we can be friends anymore.
