1
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,668
- It's culs-de-sac. 
- No way!

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,430
It is.

3
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,643
The plural of cul-de-sac is culs-de-sac?

4
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:07,557
That doesn't even sound like English.

5
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:08,720
That's because it's French.

6
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:09,661
You know what I mean.

7
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:11,443
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

8
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:13,511
Words should sound right to be right.

9
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:14,592
That's not how it works.

10
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:17,557
So, what, the plural of yo-yo is yos-yo?

11
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,452
Yeah, 'cause that sounds so natural.

12
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,064
As natural as culs-de-sac.

13
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:25,979
Hey, when did Lane start working here?

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,368
Oh, a couple of days ago.

15
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:30,766
She filled out an application, and Luke brought her in for an interview and everything.

16
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:32,225
An interview? So official.

17
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:36,622
Yeah. They sat in complete silence for a full five minutes,

18
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:38,414
then Luke said, "How ya doing?"

19
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:40,469
and she said "Good," and then he gave her the job.

20
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:41,728
So what do we get out of this?

21
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:42,640
What do you mean?

22
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:44,560
We got someone on the inside now, a friend of ours.

23
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:45,773
And out of it we could get?

24
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:47,063
The secret things he keeps back there.

25
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:48,149
His showgirl costume.

26
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:50,991
Extra jelly packets, butter, discarded day-old bread.

27
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:52,854
But we get that when we go dumpster driving.

28
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:54,016
This'll be easier on our shoes.

29
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:55,429
- Hey, Luke. 
- Look at this.

30
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,104
Who, Lane? She's super waitress,

31
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:59,633
able to leap tall pancakes in a single bound.

32
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:01,261
- Or is that pans-cake? 
- Very funny.

33
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:02,336
It's not gonna work out.

34
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:03,975
Oh. What, she's so good.

35
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:05,829
-She's too good. 
- Oh, calm down.

36
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:09,176
I'm not even sure why she took the job. I mean, I totally blew the interview.

37
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,333
You were nervous.

38
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:12,012
Hey, guys. You got this, Luke?

39
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:12,817
Yeah, I got it.

40
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:14,830
Caesar, I need that English muffin.

41
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,675
When there was a lull, she cleaned the menus without being asked.

42
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:20,359
- Do you mean mens-u? 
- Stop it.

43
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:22,279
This isn't challenging enough. She's gonna get bored.

44
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,148
- Buy her a chemistry set. 
- Or a foosball table.

45
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:25,463
I should find something to do.

46
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:27,077
Having help is stressing him.

47
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:29,201
So, now, why do you have to get back to campus so early?

48
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:30,784
Classes don't start for a couple of days.

49
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,559
Yeah, I have a lot of stuff to do.

50
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:34,224
And it'll be nice and quiet with no roommates around.

51
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:35,493
Where are the rooms-mate?

52
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,870
Janet's mountain climbing, Tanna's home,

53
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,754
and Paris went skiing with her boyfriend.

54
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:41,684
So you're just ignoring the plural thing now?

55
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:44,925
You haven't mentioned Paris' boyfriend in awhile. Everything good there?

56
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,869
What? Something's not right?

57
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:52,185
Just the weirdness of them being really busy with school,

58
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,811
and he's miles away at Princeton, but they're good.

59
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:58,027
She called me from the slopes and they sounded like they were having a blast.

60
00:02:58,155 --> 00:02:59,045
Eggs scrambled, Caesar.

61
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,175
- Luke, coffee in the corner. 
- Right, sorry.

62
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,089
Boy, maybe this Lane/Luke team isn't gonna work out.

63
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:06,690
Where do you think Luke will go?

64
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,450
I don't know. Maybe a big chain will take him on.

65
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:11,298
I wonder if he has a forklift license.

66
00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:12,809
He could redeem recyclables.

67
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:14,268
You mean recycs-able?

68
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:11,003
You promise?

69
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:13,645
Yes. This is in and out, pick a molding for the public areas,

70
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:15,315
- meeting adjourned. 
- No food sampling.

71
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:16,676
It's not on the agenda.

72
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,412
I have not seen Sookie once this month

73
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:21,002
where she has not greeted me by shoving something in my mouth.

74
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,393
Are you sure it was food every time?

75
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:25,917
You can joke, but as long as super low rise jeans are in fashion for men,

76
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:27,710
I must stay trim or I'll die.

77
00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:31,918
Come on in!

78
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,320
- How low we talking here? 
- I've had to wax.

79
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:35,630
Subject over.

80
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:42,400
Ooh, this is nice.

81
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:44,211
That's my favorite, too. A little pricey.

82
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:46,486
It's amazing how we always pick the pricey.

83
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,711
- So, do you guys want something to... 
- No!

84
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:51,174
- ... drink? I made hot water for tea. 
- Tea?

85
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:52,573
You like Earl Gray, right?

86
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,811
If you have some.

87
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,413
It's all ready. Earl Gray.

88
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,412
Thank you.

89
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,219
- And try this pizzelle. 
- I knew it.

90
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,771
- Delight! 
- This is a tasting.

91
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,178
I just need your opinion.

92
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:04,935
My opinion is you're trying to fatten me out of a love life.

93
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:06,936
- I thought you were celibate. 
- Not by choice.

94
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,161
You woke up Davey, big mouth.

95
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:11,419
Do you wanna go check on him?

96
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:12,516
He'll be out here in a second.

97
00:05:12,654 --> 00:05:15,081
He's two months and already walking? I'm missing the big moments.

98
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,929
- Tobin! 
- Tobin?

99
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:20,395
Hi, and I'm high around this little thing.

100
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,070
He's such an angel.

101
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:26,561
Hello, little booby. Did that mean old Michel wake you up?

102
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,695
I'm being Punk'd. I know I'm being Punk'd.

103
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,985
Isn't this great? We have the whole team back together.

104
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,262
I'm ecstatic. Did you know about this?

105
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,914
I knew that Tobin was back in town, but I didn't hear you were the...

106
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:38,408
Davey's nanny? Just until something permanent comes along.

107
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:41,476
Davey fell for this guy lock, stock and barrel.

108
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:42,903
It was love at first sight.

109
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:46,528
My whole life is kids. I have eleven nieces and nephews.

110
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,883
How joyous for you.

111
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,501
Now, Tobin, we'd heard you moved.

112
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,392
Yes, right after the inn burned down.

113
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,420
I moved to Utah because I heard there was

114
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:56,886
lots of job opportunities for industrious Mormons.

115
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,217
I didn't know you were a Mormon.

116
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:01,253
I wasn't, so I became one. The paperwork took weeks.

117
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,486
And I didn't know about the alcohol thing.

118
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,954
- They famously abstain. 
- No coffee either.

119
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:10,168
The choir is fabulous, but then there's the funny underwear. It didn't last.

120
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:12,099
Then he called me from the road and suggested this.

121
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:13,419
How wonderful.

122
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:15,068
Oh, I see you're trying the pizzelles.

123
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,294
Are they not pieces of heaven shaped like cookies?

124
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:19,414
Wonderful.

125
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:22,318
You know, they'd be perfect for breakfast, too, with cappuccino.

126
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,857
I've never thought of them for breakfast. Great idea.

127
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,091
It occurred to me.

128
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:28,687
You know, you could serve them on that green platter we bought yesterday.

129
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:30,433
The colors would juxtapose nicely.

130
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:31,739
You went shopping together?

131
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:35,328
Yes. I turned Sookie onto a place that sells hard-to-find kitchenware.

132
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:38,461
Oh, and I found some websites I'd like to recommend to you, Lorelai.

133
00:06:38,593 --> 00:06:41,175
I spent a lot of time online when I was a Mormon.

134
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:42,338
There wasn't much else to do.

135
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:46,370
Excuse me, is this not an inn meeting for inn employees only?

136
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,353
It's okay, little baby.

137
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:51,220
I think your voice hits a pitch that hurts his ears.

138
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:53,898
My voice has the same pitch as anyone else's.

139
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,841
- Michel hates babies. 
- I do not hate babies.

140
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:58,527
- Well, babies hate you. 
- They do not hate me.

141
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:01,250
Look, all I'm saying is, we have limited time together,

142
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:03,927
the three of us, and we cannot afford to waste it,

143
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,541
the three of us, and he's cutting in.

144
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,276
Michel, I'm not cutting in.

145
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,073
But the fact is, wherever Sookie goes, the baby goes,

146
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:13,175
and wherever the baby goes, I go. It's my job.

147
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:16,032
We even made a joke earlier - the baby has a meeting today.

148
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:21,603
- I love this. 
- We do, too.

149
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,328
Would you like a cup of tea, Tobin?

150
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,448
Just a little lapsing oolong, please.

151
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,449
- You knew that? 
- Yes, I did.

152
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:33,261
- Come on! 
- Everyone does.

153
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,218
- Did you? 
- Of course I did.

154
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:37,547
So everyone in the entire world knew the plural

155
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,207
of cul-de-sac was culs-de-sac?

156
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:40,641
- Yes. 
- Okay.

157
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,698
So Mariah Carey is out with some friends

158
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:45,894
and she's had a couple cocktails, she glances down from the roof

159
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,094
and says, "Oh, look at all those culs-de-sac."

160
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:50,225
Why are they on the roof?

161
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,192
It's a rooftop bar.

162
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,206
How have you been saying it?

163
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:53,189
Cul-de-sacs.

164
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,540
And no one ever corrected you?

165
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,410
No, because that's the way it should be.

166
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,725
Even if it isn't technically correct,

167
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,704
- it should be pronounced that way. 
- Mom, Mom, just let it go.

168
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,850
- I will never let this go. 
- Is there dessert?

169
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:06,424
Yes, and we have a special surprise for you for dessert.

170
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:07,551
We brought it back from Switzerland.

171
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:08,698
We're getting a mountain goat?

172
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:09,629
This is better than a goat.

173
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:10,664
Let's go into the living room.

174
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:11,950
Dessert from Switzerland.

175
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:13,199
The land of chocolate.

176
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,513
You two are going to love this.

177
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:16,738
Is it as good as Toblerone?

178
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:18,489
Oh, it's better than Toblerone.

179
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:22,358
Whoa, what is that?

180
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:23,663
It's marzipan.

181
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:24,734
Marzipan?

182
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:28,630
The finest marzipan in all of Europe.

183
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:30,464
Made by cloistered nuns.

184
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:33,177
We toured their cloister, it was right out of "The Sound of Music."

185
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:34,344
What happened to the chocolate?

186
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:35,073
What chocolate?

187
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:36,981
You compared it to Toblerone - that's chocolate.

188
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,352
You brought up Toblerone.

189
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,626
I just said it was better than that because I think it is.

190
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,609
Marzipan is candy. You like candy.

191
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:43,918
Marzipan is not candy.

192
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:47,887
It is a unique substance unto itself, like Velveeta or plutonium.

193
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:49,074
You're not even going to try it?

194
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:50,729
- I'll pass. 
- I'll try some, Grandma.

195
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:53,009
- Take the one with the little pig on it. 
- Oh, thank you.

196
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:56,321
We got the pigs for you and the bunny for your mother.

197
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,379
You got me bunnies?

198
00:08:58,588 --> 00:08:59,843
They're for whomever now.

199
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,464
Well, no, I'll try a bunny.

200
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:02,675
Don't force yourself.

201
00:09:02,828 --> 00:09:04,578
I'm not. I want a bunny. Give me a bunny.

202
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:06,842
Delicious.

203
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,913
Those nuns kick you-know-what.

204
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:13,263
- Now who can that be? 
- Ah, it's probably Jason.

205
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:15,664
He said he might drop something by on his way back from the airport.

206
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,045
- In the middle of dinner? 
- He won't be here long.

207
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:20,534
He's probably exhausted. The flight from Australia is draining.

208
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:22,044
Jason, welcome back.

209
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,917
Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt your evening.

210
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,243
Oh, oh, not at all. You look fit.

211
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:28,663
- Look how fit he looks, Emily. 
- He looks very fit.

212
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:30,184
- Hello, Jason. 
- Emily.

213
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:32,023
You've met Lorelai and Rory.

214
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:33,728
Yes, it's nice to see you again.

215
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:34,665
Same here.

216
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:38,209
Richard, here are the papers, and they do not need to be notarized.

217
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,793
Oh, that's a huge help. Terrific.

218
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:42,795
So, Mom, maybe our guest would...

219
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,783
Oh, Jason, would you like some marzipan?

220
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:48,157
Would I? I love marzipan.

221
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,629
Take as much as you like, and put some extra into a napkin.

222
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,434
Just not the one Lorelai spat her piece into.

223
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,735
Mmm, delicious.

224
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:02,558
I'll be going. It was good to see you all again.

225
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:03,373
Oh, here.

226
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,318
No, no, no, no, Richard, you don't have to see me out.

227
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:06,266
All right. See you tomorrow.

228
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:10,224
He must have been hiking the whole time. He looks wonderful.

229
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:14,043
Excuse me, I just have to freshen up my... be right back.

230
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,660
Have you swallowed your marzipan yet?

231
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:28,979
Hello?

232
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:31,166
So, you're back.

233
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:33,480
I am no hologram.

234
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:36,700
Australia was good?

235
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,278
Very good. Hot.

236
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,800
You tie your wallaby down, sport?

237
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:44,415
No, I just drank a lot of beer

238
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:46,731
and thought about you a lot.

239
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,626
That's very sweet.

240
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:49,039
So when are we getting together again?

241
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,488
- When do you want? 
- How about now?

242
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,733
Too spontaneous.

243
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,895
How about Monday night?

244
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:54,569
- For what? 
- Dinner, et cetera.

245
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:56,387
- Sounds good, et cetera. 
- I'll call you.

246
00:10:56,494 --> 00:10:58,430
Okay. Hey, what are you gonna do with your marzipan?

247
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,738
Oh, I don't know. I thought I'd dump 'em on the road,

248
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:03,299
but is that environmentally sound?

249
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:04,692
I don't think marzipan biodegrades.

250
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,545
I'll just serve it to the clients I don't like.

251
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,929
- Well, bye. 
- I'll see you Monday.

252
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:13,350
Almost done with your radiator, young lady.

253
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,292
Take your time.

254
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:17,006
You were smart. You come back early, you beat the rush.

255
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:18,878
I just wanted to get a jump on things.

256
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:21,275
I like the campus when it's kind of empty like this,

257
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,255
you know, all quiet. Snow's pretty, too.

258
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:25,669
Yeah, very pretty.

259
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:28,368
There's something very magical about this campus.

260
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,637
I've been here 23 years come August and I've never been bored.

261
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,895
You know, we've had presidents graduate from this school.

262
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:36,324
- You okay? 
- What?

263
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,411
You feeling okay?

264
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:39,186
Yes. I...

265
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:41,265
Yes. Thanks.

266
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,090
- Rory. 
- Paris, hi.

267
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:48,862
- You're back early. 
- You're back early.

268
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:51,244
Just thought I'd get a jump on things. How was your trip?

269
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:52,952
Great. I thought I'd come back early.

270
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:54,439
Same here. Where's your stuff?

271
00:11:54,603 --> 00:11:56,138
- I got back early. 
- I know.

272
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,015
Early this morning, so I unpacked and then I went to visit my mom.

273
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:00,458
- Is she good? 
- She wasn't there.

274
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,954
- Jamie says hello. 
- Oh, good. Hello back at him.

275
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,896
- So, you guys have fun? 
- I told you that on the phone.

276
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:07,391
I know. You have fun after that?

277
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,000
Sure. The resort was beautiful.

278
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:12,286
A little too star-studded. Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart were there.

279
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,303
- They tongue kissed in public. 
- They're in love.

280
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:16,783
Then she'd tickle his tummy and he'd giggle. It was foul.

281
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:18,088
To each his own.

282
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:19,537
I'll get out of your way.

283
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,852
You're not in my way. I'll get out of your way.

284
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:21,722
You're not in my way.

285
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:22,721
I'll just stay here, then.

286
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,423
Good.

287
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,199
End scene.

288
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:39,592
Shoot.

289
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,810
- What are you doing? 
- Oh, God!

290
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,464
Rory! Announce yourself!

291
00:12:58,573 --> 00:12:59,862
Were you brushing dirt under the sink?

292
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:02,289
No, I am brushing crumbs under the sink.

293
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:03,149
You're a pig.

294
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:05,458
You're just learning that? Why are you here anyway?

295
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:06,949
Oh, crabby and dirty.

296
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:10,798
I thought you were going to hang at school for some alone time.

297
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:12,447
Alone time suddenly included Paris.

298
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,788
Oh. I thought Paris was skiing with Jamie.

299
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:17,777
Paris is definitely not skiing, and Paris is definitely not with Jamie.

300
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,031
Hm, meaning?

301
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,490
There are little marshmallow Easter bunnies under here.

302
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,531
No, no, what did you mean when you said Paris was not with Jamie?

303
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,010
Paris is seeing somebody else.

304
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:27,567
Really? A psychiatrist?

305
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,538
A professor.

306
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,019
- At Yale? 
- Yes.

307
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,807
Lorelai Gilmore, you've been holding out on me.

308
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,951
It's so weird. One minute, she's totally in love with Jamie

309
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:40,126
and then the next, she's making out with a professor in a dark corner.

310
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:41,145
You saw them making out?

311
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:43,173
Apparently, the big game was big for everyone.

312
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:46,603
Wow. I can't believe Paris is doing an older man.

313
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:48,073
Who said doing? I didn't say doing.

314
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:49,501
I just said kissing, that's it.

315
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:52,194
Rory, come on. When you're dating an older man,

316
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:54,806
- you're probably doing older-man things. 
- Oh, geez.

317
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:56,848
So what age are we talking here, like 35, 40?

318
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:01,999
- 45? 46? 47? 47½? 48? 
- Sixty!

319
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:04,951
- What?! Shut up! 
- He went to school with Grandpa.

320
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,975
- Sixty? 
- That's how they met.

321
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:09,710
We were having lunch, he came by, Grandpa introduced them.

322
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:12,454
She wanted to get an interview, and apparently, she got one.

323
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:14,794
- Sixty? Like sixty-sixty? 
- Mom.

324
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:16,120
I'm sorry, it's just...

325
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:18,245
Now I know who Woody Allen's next leading lady's gonna be.

326
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:20,795
And it's so annoying. I mean, she's hiding it from me,

327
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:23,068
so I'm not supposed to know. I'm supposed to think that she's still with Jamie,

328
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:24,722
- which she's not. 
- Are you sure?

329
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:26,201
- No. 
- Intrigue.

330
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:28,199
I don't like intrigue, I don't want intrigue.

331
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:31,608
I like Jamie. He's a nice guy. He's a patient guy.

332
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:33,635
I mean, Paris should not be treating him like this.

333
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:36,415
Oh, honey, if she likes another guy, there's nothing you can do about it.

334
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,951
Let us all remember Dean.

335
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,106
This is not the same as Dean. I did not cheat on Dean with an old guy.

336
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,186
Is the old guy married?

337
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:44,638
He was. He has kids, grown kids. He's a writer.

338
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:46,368
Well, what would the school say if they knew about this?

339
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,099
Yes, what about that? This guy's risking everything -

340
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:51,417
- his job, his reputation. 
- Yes, well...

341
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:52,934
he'll always have Paris.

342
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:54,813
How long have you been waiting with that one?

343
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:57,218
I just had a feeling the opportunity would present itself eventually.

344
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:58,784
Maybe it's a phase. It'll pass.

345
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:00,726
Oh, yeah, or he will.

346
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,635
Hello?

347
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,742
What? Michel?

348
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:10,495
Calm down. I can't understand you when you're not screaming hysterically.

349
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,208
Okay, what are you...

350
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:16,533
Okay! Okay, I'll be right there. Goodbye.

351
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,712
- I gotta go. 
- Why? What's up?

352
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,316
- Michel's spazzing. 
- Why?

353
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:22,260
I don't know. Will you be here when I get back?

354
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,122
If you don't mind. Paris was getting out her potter's wheel as I was leaving.

355
00:15:25,286 --> 00:15:27,412
Okay, I'll go pick up Chinese.

356
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,835
Or we can just eat what's under the sink.

357
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:30,421
- Ah, the wit. 
- Get egg rolls.

358
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,464
All right, just watch out - old guys don't like 'em bossy.

359
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:37,212
You took so long! Why? You need to charter an airplane?

360
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,558
I came as quickly as I - ow!

361
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:39,946
- Get in here. 
- What is going on?

362
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,085
- Move quicker, please. 
- Is Sookie here?

363
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,150
She and the farmer went to see a movie.

364
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,316
Do they know you're here?

365
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:46,783
Yes, they do.

366
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,142
- And they're okay with that? 
- This way, please.

367
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:52,326
Stop. What's going on? Why are we in the bedroom?

368
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,656
- I offered to babysit. 
- I'm sorry, you did what?

369
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,504
I heard Sookie talking to the potato man about wanting to go out,

370
00:15:57,604 --> 00:16:00,273
and there was no one to watch the baby, so I offered to watch it for her.

371
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:01,978
- It? 
- Him. Watch him for her.

372
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,862
- And she let you? 
- Yes, she let me.

373
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:07,209
So I came over, and the minute that she left, it started to cry.

374
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:08,460
- It? 
- Him, he started to cry.

375
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:11,168
He wouldn't stop. I did everything. I did the jiggle and the bouncy

376
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,935
and the airplane, and then I even picked it up.

377
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:14,266
- It? 
- Him, dammit, him!

378
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:17,076
I picked him up, but it didn't matter. He wouldn't stop crying.

379
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,772
So finally I invented a game.

380
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:20,902
- What kind of game? 
- I called it baby crepe.

381
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,303
- I don't think I know that one. 
- Well, it's quite ingenious.

382
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,568
You get down here on the floor and then you roll him up in a blanket

383
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:30,328
and then you pull it back and forth and back and forth.

384
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:34,516
He loved it. He did not cry, he smiled, he giggled.

385
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:37,148
He was having the time of his life. And then...

386
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:39,748
- Oh no. 
- I pulled back the blanket a little too hard.

387
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,520
- What? 
- And he rolled under the bed.

388
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:42,958
- What? 
- And he got stuck.

389
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:44,182
Oh! Oh my God!

390
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:46,475
I tried to get him out, but I couldn't get him to grab the string,

391
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:48,688
and then he fell asleep, and I worried if I woke him up,

392
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:50,127
the screaming would start again.

393
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,389
I can't believe you rolled little Davey under the bed.

394
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,423
- Davey? 
- Yes, Davey, Sookie's baby.

395
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,097
Is that his name? I've been calling him Truman.

396
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,735
- Why? 
- I thought that's what his name was.

397
00:16:57,843 --> 00:16:58,753
Where'd you get Truman from?

398
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:00,110
I don't know, I heard it wrong, okay?

399
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,309
Do you think he's gonna hold this against me?

400
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,827
What, the man that rolled him under the bed? No, I think you're good.

401
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,988
Oh, man, he really is sleeping. He looks so peaceful.

402
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,518
See? I made him happy.

403
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:10,357
We need to lift this bed and get him up.

404
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:13,781
- What are you doing? 
- Taking off my shirt.

405
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,161
What part of "lift the bed and get him out" translates to

406
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,954
- you taking off your shirt? 
- This is an expensive shirt.

407
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:20,448
No, no, no. I'm not lifting the bed with a naked you.

408
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,907
I wasn't going to take off my pants.

409
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,653
- Leave the shirt on. 
- It will wrinkle.

410
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,947
Not as much as it will if Sookie comes home and finds Truman

411
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,183
under the bed. Now, Lift up here, and I'll get him out.

412
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:31,875
I can't hold this by myself. Are you crazy?

413
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:33,333
Okay, you hold that. Are you ready?

414
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,103
No!

415
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:37,744
Hey. Hey, Davey. I gotcha.

416
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:44,046
- You're snoozy, huh? Yeah. 
- How is he?

417
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,169
He's just fine. He's just fine.

418
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:48,982
There you go.

419
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:51,435
Just kick back, wait 'til Mommy gets home.

420
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:55,561
Now please tell me what is going on here.

421
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:57,727
- Nothing. 
- Why are you babysitting?

422
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,936
- I... 
- You hate babies.

423
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:00,400
Not really.

424
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:01,961
You do not babysit ever.

425
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,506
And yet here you are wearing your super-low-cut jeans

426
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:06,206
making up baby games, and I want to know why.

427
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,909
I hate Tobin! He's a sniveling little sycophantic tushie kisser,

428
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,214
- and I hate him! 
- Michel!

429
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:14,552
He weasels his way into every area of my life.

430
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:16,855
The only good thing about the Independence Inn burning down

431
00:18:16,953 --> 00:18:19,626
was that Tobin was gone, but yet, here he is, back.

432
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,731
- He's like the cat. 
- What cat?

433
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,754
The one that came back the very next day.

434
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:24,843
You thought he was a goner, but the cat came back.

435
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,113
He just wouldn't stay away.

436
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,366
Michel, you do not have to be jealous of Tobin.

437
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:30,260
He wants to replace me.

438
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:31,843
- As what? 
- As everything.

439
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:33,669
He wants to replace me in my entire life.

440
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:37,132
He's going to keep worming his way in until you no longer find any reason

441
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:38,893
- to have me around. 
- You're being silly.

442
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:40,352
He's going to succeed.

443
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:44,105
It doesn't matter that I have all the experience and the credentials and the history

444
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:47,084
to run this inn. He likes the baby. He holds the baby.

445
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:49,258
He doesn't roll the baby under the bed - he wins!

446
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:51,370
Oh, he does not win.

447
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,716
Michel, this rivalry is in your head.

448
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:55,563
- It is, huh? 
- Yes.

449
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,970
So you do not like Tobin better than me?

450
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:00,320
No. We like Tobin.

451
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,112
We're addicted to you.

452
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,299
- You are? 
- Yes.

453
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,244
We asked you to come with us to the Dragonfly, didn't we?

454
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:10,156
We love you, Michel, and as long as you stay far, far away from little Davey,

455
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:11,323
we will continue loving you.

456
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:15,261
- I can do that. 
- Good.

457
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:19,695
Okay, hold on.

458
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,603
And... what do you think?

459
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,333
It stinks.

460
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,277
Well, it's a newspaper hat. It's not supposed to spark a trend.

461
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:30,699
There.

462
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,001
- How'd you do that? 
- Martha Stewart.

463
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:34,823
Martha Stewart actually did a segment on

464
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,386
how to make a hat out of newspaper?

465
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:38,896
- Yes. 
- Oh. Well, it looks nice.

466
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:42,961
Aah! What is this? Academically approved torture?

467
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,146
Make your own hat - that's how you get on the paper?

468
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:47,148
'Cause that has what to do with anything?

469
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,664
- Relax, Glenn. 
- It's tradition.

470
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:50,916
It's not tradition. It's hazing.

471
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:54,869
Why don't they just handcuff us naked to a streetlamp wearing a sign

472
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:57,891
that says, "honk if you like unbiased journalism"?

473
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,334
I'm not doing it. They can't make me.

474
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:01,193
You don't wear the hat, you're not getting on the paper.

475
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,026
I need another sheet.

476
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:04,700
Ladies and gentlemen,

477
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:07,696
tonight represents a melding of the old and the new.

478
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,527
For one night, identifying the two groups will be easy.

479
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:12,841
The old will be the ones running around frantically

480
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,947
trying to get out the latest issue of the Daily News,

481
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,087
and the new will be the ones in the stupid hats.

482
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:20,741
It's a much-beloved tradition that for one night, all night,

483
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:24,085
you don a hat of your own making, wait on members of the paper

484
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,213
while observing the inner working of the Yale Daily News.

485
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:30,480
There's a lot of new, fresh talent sitting in this room tonight.

486
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:34,940
Rory Gilmore, an unflinchingly honest reviewer who shows no mercy,

487
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:36,991
but a great deal of dark wit in her pieces.

488
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:40,376
Paris Geller, whose interview with Professor Asher Fleming

489
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,824
was the most intimate and revealing portrait of a complicated man

490
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:44,053
that I have ever read.

491
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:48,267
Glenn Babble, whose cartoon commentaries on the American family

492
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,910
prove that he was never hugged a day in his life.

493
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:54,616
It's hard work being here, but it's an honor.

494
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,207
You're working with the best of the best.

495
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,977
From here, you can go to the New York Times, the Washington Post.

496
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,921
You can even sell out your ideals completely like the cofounders

497
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:05,116
of the Daily News did when they started Time magazine,

498
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:08,604
which has basically become an overhyped, illustrated birdcage liner.

499
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:11,817
News for the "Reader's Digest" bunch, I call it.

500
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:15,531
The "just give us the gist of it" magazine masquerading as a real news outlet.

501
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:18,720
I mean, let's face it - if it weren't for waiting rooms all over the world,

502
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,973
there'd be absolutely no need for Time magazine... at all.

503
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:24,409
I hate Time magazine! Cheryl, I need tea!

504
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,106
You know, you never told me what you thought of my article.

505
00:21:28,352 --> 00:21:30,174
What article?

506
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,289
My interview with Asher Fleming. Did you read it?

507
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:33,180
I skimmed it.

508
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,007
I have a copy in our room. I can give it to you tomorrow.

509
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,573
You're a good writer. I'm sure it's good.

510
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:39,498
Yeah, but still, I'd like you to read it.

511
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:42,351
I trust your opinion, and I'd like to be able to discuss it with you.

512
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:45,197
Look, we're supposed to be taking dinner orders, so...

513
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:48,365
Hello?

514
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:51,894
No phone calls while you're wearing the hat!

515
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:53,333
Hold on.

516
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:56,027
- I will be right back. 
- Where are you going?

517
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:59,145
You're not supposed to leave while you're wearing the hat.

518
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:00,365
I will be right back.

519
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:06,394
It's a good thing high school had already beaten all the self-esteem out of me.

520
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,062
How could you talk through an entire movie?

521
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,167
Well, nothing else was happening.

522
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:15,897
An entire movie was happening.

523
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:18,724
There were people in costumes and horses.

524
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:20,259
- Did you see the horses? 
- I did see the horses.

525
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:21,262
I thought you liked horses.

526
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,464
I do like horses, but they never let them talk.

527
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,855
That's because this wasn't a talking-horse movie.

528
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:27,919
- You want some wine? 
- Oh, I don't know.

529
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:31,324
- You're vibing my movie-watching habits. 
- I am not vibing your habits.

530
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:34,288
I'm merely saying that the large man in a wife beater

531
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:37,114
sitting in front of us invited me into the lobby to discuss your habits,

532
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:40,038
and had I accepted his charming invitation,

533
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,864
- I might be in traction right now. 
- Oh, please.

534
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:45,277
You could totally have outrun him. You're spry.

535
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:46,173
Thank you.

536
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,331
So, this is your place.

537
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:51,500
This is it.

538
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:53,796
Interesting. Very, very interesting.

539
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,305
So, what's the verdict?

540
00:22:56,914 --> 00:22:58,512
You're not a tchotchke guy.

541
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:02,895
Yeah, I don't like too many objects around that have no obvious purpose.

542
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:05,556
The purpose of tchotchkes is to make you happy.

543
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:07,144
They make you smile.

544
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:09,340
They make a room seem fun and whimsical.

545
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:13,063
I invite a clown over once a week to make the room feel fun and whimsical,

546
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,787
so I feel all set in that department.

547
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:16,421
- I thought you said you had a dog. 
- I do.

548
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:17,763
- Where is he? 
- Over there.

549
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:23,123
Oh. He's cute... and very still.

550
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:24,517
Yeah, he's the best.

551
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,842
- What is his name? 
- Cyrus.

552
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:28,321
Cyrus, sure. Perfect name for a dog.

553
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,657
Cyrus. Hi, Cyrus.

554
00:23:30,446 --> 00:23:31,418
Is he breathing?

555
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:36,253
Cyrus was actually trained by the monks of New Skete.

556
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,507
He's incredibly well-behaved. He was housebroken in an hour.

557
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:44,018
He has a two-bark minimum for delivery guys, three for everybody else,

558
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,634
but the best thing about him is he doesn't do any of the standard

559
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,734
"sit and lie down" commands. I taught him very special commands

560
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,777
- that only my dog could know. 
- Like what?

561
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:55,473
Like... a little to the left.

562
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,209
Shut up.

563
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:58,411
Cyrus, a little to the left.

564
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,467
What the hell's that good for?

565
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:04,637
Well, what the hell is "sit" good for?

566
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:05,920
When you sit, you get a cookie.

567
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:08,611
When you move a little to the left,

568
00:24:08,735 --> 00:24:10,654
you get the satisfaction of knowing you are doing something,

569
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,508
but you are not pandering for a dog bone.

570
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,732
Can he move a little to the right?

571
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,859
No, not yet. We just do a little to the left until he hits the wall,

572
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:17,960
and then I turn him around.

573
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:20,940
You and your dog are extremely weird.

574
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:21,862
Thank you.

575
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,334
Thank you.

576
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,247
I'm not sure we're setting such a good example for Cyrus over there.

577
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:40,028
Oh, you might be right.

578
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,681
Cyrus...

579
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,212
Okay.

580
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:48,296
That one, I get.

581
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,470
Every week, you argue with me.

582
00:24:55,572 --> 00:24:56,893
But Doyle, it's a perfectly good article.

583
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,599
We don't do "perfectly good" here.

584
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:00,851
You want to do "perfectly good," go to Harvard.

585
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:02,033
Jackass.

586
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:04,400
Can you beat him to death with that?

587
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,843
I don't think so. It's soft serve.

588
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:08,222
I got your ice cream. 

589
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:10,922
What is this?

590
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:12,904
- Strawberry ice cream. 
- It has strawberries in it.

591
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:15,279
I don't even know how to respond to that.

592
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:18,479
I wanted plain strawberry ice cream without chunks of strawberries in it.

593
00:25:18,622 --> 00:25:20,915
- This has chunks. 
- I see one.

594
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:22,242
I can't eat this. Take it away.

595
00:25:22,406 --> 00:25:23,706
Would you like me to get you something else?

596
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,787
No, just forget it.

597
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,388
Fine. Bring it back.

598
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,785
- Are you okay, Doyle? 
- Yes. Why wouldn't I be?

599
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:35,334
I don't know. You just seem a little bit annoyed tonight.

600
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:38,571
I have an issue to put out with a big hole on the back page

601
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,879
because my editorial writers chose to be unopinionated today!

602
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,132
And that's it?

603
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:47,249
And I got rejected for a job as Yale's stringer to Time magazine.

604
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:49,343
Ah, so, that explains it.

605
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,022
This is a major blow to my career, you know.

606
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,902
You're twenty.

607
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:54,059
These things can follow you, Rory. One day you're feeling good,

608
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:56,670
you're the fair-haired boy, and the next day you're Schleprock.

609
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:57,940
You're not Schleprock, Doyle.

610
00:25:58,088 --> 00:25:59,003
Tell that to my dad.

611
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:02,727
Okay, I just have to say how amazingly unfair it is

612
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:06,746
that I have a rubber band working its way into my brain, and Paris gets to bail.

613
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:08,481
- Paris isn't here? 
- No, she isn't.

614
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:09,679
You didn't know she left?

615
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:12,781
No, I knew that there was this thing with her family,

616
00:26:12,991 --> 00:26:15,337
that she was really concerned about.

617
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:18,261
Well, you know she got that call, and her aunt is sick,

618
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:20,872
and I heard her say something about going to the hospital

619
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,674
so I think that's where she went.

620
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:25,346
All right. Well, come get me the minute she gets back.

621
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:26,370
I will.

622
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,139
Hey, do you have a Cosmo lying around?

623
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:37,184
'Cause I wanna see how many calories I just burned off.

624
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:39,340
I've looked. It's 55.

625
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:42,090
Oh, no, it's way more than 55.

626
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:46,630
I know what 55 is, and that, my friend, was not 55.

627
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:47,779
Thanks.

628
00:26:48,397 --> 00:26:50,040
Are you cold? I could turn up the heat.

629
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,064
Oh, please, enough with the bragging.

630
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:54,311
So, you're good?

631
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:59,565
I'm good. I'm gonna fall asleep extremely happy tonight.

632
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:04,234
- Hi. 
- Hi back.

633
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,562
Are you thinking about joining me back here anytime soon?

634
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:09,127
Joining you...

635
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,443
- Well... 
- Jason?

636
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:16,951
Okay, just remember, you like that I have little quirks.

637
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:20,372
They're what make me me.

638
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,198
You're not gonna ask to wear my dress, are you?

639
00:27:22,671 --> 00:27:25,272
No. I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind

640
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,875
sleeping in the guest room tonight.

641
00:27:28,027 --> 00:27:29,118
Well...

642
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:31,221
didn't see that one coming.

643
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:34,205
I am the world's lightest sleeper. I have chronic insomnia,

644
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,698
so I just, I toss and I turn like a crazy person,

645
00:27:37,795 --> 00:27:40,243
and I can't sleep in the same bed with another person.

646
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,629
- You're serious? 
- Yeah.

647
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,377
You want me to go in the guest room?

648
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,640
It's a really nice room.

649
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:47,437
You know, why don't I just go?

650
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:50,268
Oh, no, no, no, please, I swear, I want you to stay.

651
00:27:50,365 --> 00:27:52,516
I want to see you in the morning. I wanna make you breakfast.

652
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:53,990
I want you to be here when I get up.

653
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:56,935
Well, not here... in there, but...

654
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:59,447
You know, Jason, you don't have to go to all this trouble

655
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:00,808
just to get me to leave.

656
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:02,048
I don't want you to leave.

657
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:03,611
I'm a big girl, I can handle the truth.

658
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:04,547
This is the truth.

659
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:07,410
It's fine, I have things I need to do tomorrow.

660
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,443
I should probably go home anyhow.

661
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:13,416
Please, just look at the room.

662
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,872
Just one look. A peek.

663
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:18,736
You don't even have to use both eyes if you don't want to.

664
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,602
- One look. 
- That's all I ask.

665
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:27,997
Well, that, and you get out of the bed very slowly.

666
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,703
You know what, don't flirt with me.

667
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:31,234
I'm finding you weird right now.

668
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:32,457
Fair enough. Here you go.

669
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:37,126
Here it is.

670
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:41,417
It's okay.

671
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:44,986
There are hundreds of great books in here,

672
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:47,444
ranging from the classics - "Wuthering Heights" -

673
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:50,289
to the real classics - "Valley of the Dolls."

674
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,227
Nice taste.

675
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:54,120
Fully loaded minibar - soda, candy, little bottles of hooch.

676
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,843
A really great CD player,

677
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,614
CD's down below, and a DVD library above.

678
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:01,211
DVD's but no TV?

679
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:11,877
Oh, come on, that is cool.

680
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:14,482
Okay, fine, it's cool. The room is good.

681
00:29:15,082 --> 00:29:17,579
It's better than good. I would love this room.

682
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:19,546
You do know you can have it, don't you?

683
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:22,617
I can't have any distractions in my room or I won't sleep.

684
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,893
- Really? 
- That's right.

685
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,793
TV, reading material, unbelievably gorgeous woman.

686
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,106
I should at least get billing over the TV.

687
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:34,030
- It's plasma. 
- Oh, right.

688
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:36,616
- So, what do you think? 
- Well...

689
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:38,890
There's Kiehl's products in the bathroom.

690
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:40,734
Jason, I promise,

691
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:43,528
if I leave, it won't be that big a deal.

692
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:45,750
It'll be a very big deal to me.

693
00:29:46,032 --> 00:29:48,316
Please. Stay.

694
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:51,787
- Okay. 
- Yes?

695
00:29:52,765 --> 00:29:54,536
Yes. Freak.

696
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,760
Thank you.

697
00:29:56,314 --> 00:29:57,819
Even for the "freak," thank you.

698
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,257
There's a loofah in the top drawer.

699
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:10,286
Good night.

700
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:11,919
Good night.

701
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:14,569
It's late.

702
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:18,732
Late, late, late...

703
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:22,607
Don't you wanna know where I was?

704
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,532
No, I don't.

705
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,322
I completely lost track of time.

706
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:30,476
I guess I should remember to take a watch with me from now on.

707
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:35,550
Man, when I got that call tonight, I had no idea it was gonna go this late.

708
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:40,132
Yes, it was quite a night.

709
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:41,828
Tonight.

710
00:31:44,622 --> 00:31:46,286
You're sure you don't wanna know where I was?

711
00:31:46,435 --> 00:31:48,345
No, I don't wanna know where you were,

712
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:51,776
and I don't wanna know what you were doing or who you were doing it with.

713
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,259
I had to cover for you when Doyle noticed that you were gone,

714
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,987
so I told him that you were at a family thing, and as far as I'm concerned,

715
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:59,296
that's where you were - at your family thing.

716
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:02,425
And in the future, I want nothing to do with anything to do

717
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:05,175
with what you were doing tonight or who you were doing it with,

718
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:06,618
especially who!

719
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:08,057
Now, go to sleep.

720
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:12,067
I smell like pipe tobacco.

721
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,618
Oh, jeez.

722
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:24,800
Hi, Cyrus.

723
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:29,439
Oh, good. Listen, would you still find me attractive if I were poor?

724
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:31,687
Um, no.

725
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:33,458
Ah, that's what I figured. Sleep good?

726
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,695
I watched "The Daily Show,"

727
00:32:35,817 --> 00:32:38,097
fell into the best sleep I ever had, woke up,

728
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:39,893
watched "Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"

729
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:42,499
had a vanilla-scented jacuzzi bath.

730
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:45,125
Ah, so that's what the look on your face is.

731
00:32:45,235 --> 00:32:46,443
I thought it was from sex with me.

732
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:48,209
No, it's from the jacuzzi bath.

733
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:50,093
- Good morning. 
- Good morning.

734
00:32:51,563 --> 00:32:53,242
- Coffee's over here. 
- Thank you.

735
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:55,500
The coffee smells good.

736
00:32:55,888 --> 00:32:59,452
Hey, can we... not sleep together again tonight?

737
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:02,405
Absolutely. You want cheese in your eggs?

738
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:03,364
Why not?

739
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,215
Mm, good.

740
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:08,407
I think we're ready to go.

741
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:15,580
Wow, look what you've done here.

742
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:17,464
Well, I am trying to impress you.

743
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:19,778
Trust me, once you're completely mad about me,

744
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:21,863
it is back to corn flakes and beer.

745
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:28,994
- This is lovely. 
- You are lovely.

746
00:33:34,418 --> 00:33:35,181
Very good.

747
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:36,777
Tomorrow I'll make blintzes.

748
00:33:37,686 --> 00:33:39,788
Listen, we should talk about what we're gonna do.

749
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:40,833
About what?

750
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:42,814
I mean, you know, what we're gonna...

751
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:45,390
say to people about us.

752
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:48,206
How about "yahoo"?

753
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,832
No, I'm talking about what we're gonna say to my parents about us.

754
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:52,379
Oh, well, I thought we'd say that we're having

755
00:33:52,485 --> 00:33:54,771
repeated sexual encounters out of wedlock continuously

756
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:56,838
as catholic schoolchildren are walking by.

757
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:57,666
Perfect.

758
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:58,676
No, you know...

759
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:00,299
we like each other, we're dating...

760
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:02,087
pretty simple.

761
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:05,030
Nothing is simple when it comes to my parents.

762
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,336
Okay, what do you want to say?

763
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:07,385
I'd like to say nothing.

764
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:08,756
Nothing?

765
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:11,471
I mean, it isn't really any of their business anyhow, is it?

766
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:13,350
No, but we can't just say nothing.

767
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:15,776
It'll cause too many problems if they know.

768
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:18,536
In my experience, these things have a way of coming out.

769
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,467
- How? 
- I don't know. Somebody slips up.

770
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,238
I never slip up. I'm completely non-slip.

771
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:24,332
I'm like one of those rubber mats you stick in the bottom of the tub.

772
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:25,833
Why can't we tell your parents about this?

773
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:27,314
I just think it's weird.

774
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:29,714
You're in business with my father and he won't like this.

775
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:30,646
He'll get used to it.

776
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,325
My father has never gotten used to anything.

777
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:34,425
He still misses diesel fuel, for God's sake.

778
00:34:34,558 --> 00:34:36,400
You don't find it exhausting, keeping secrets?

779
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,914
You have to watch everything you say.

780
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,796
I always have to watch everything that I say around my parents anyway.

781
00:34:41,904 --> 00:34:44,249
Okay, how about we just tell one of them, just to see how that goes?

782
00:34:44,393 --> 00:34:45,673
Please, Jason.

783
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:50,471
We will tell them eventually, I promise, just not now.

784
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:53,029
Okay. They're your parents,

785
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:55,406
and if you feel that strongly, then we'll wait.

786
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:56,399
Thank you.

787
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,371
Hey, can I feed this to Cyrus?

788
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,957
Sure. Hey, Cyrus, you want the bacon?

789
00:35:06,491 --> 00:35:08,217
That is one strange dog, Jason.

790
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,550
Excuse me. Do you know how much longer it's going on?

791
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,267
No...

792
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:29,444
- Well, hello. 
- Are we too late?

793
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:30,996
- No, of course not. 
- Good.

794
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,074
- May I have your ticket, please? 
- I don't have a ticket.

795
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:34,703
Well, you can't take the tour without a ticket.

796
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,358
Excuse me, Dorrie, this is my daughter.

797
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,743
Oh! Well, hello there.

798
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:42,224
- Come in, Lorelai. 
- Okay. Bye.

799
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:45,358
Mom, what is going on?

800
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:48,455
We let the Historical Society use our house for a walking tour.

801
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:50,641
It's for a good cause, and I am never doing it again.

802
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,843
It was supposed to end at five o'clock, Emily.

803
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:58,681
I know that, Richard. What do you want me to do, throw them out?

804
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:01,523
This is not how it's done. This is not how proper charities work.

805
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:05,259
You do not infringe on people's lives. You make a plan and stick to it.

806
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,094
Oh, look. They hired actors to be the family. How clever.

807
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,132
- We are not actors! 
- Richard, please.

808
00:36:11,245 --> 00:36:13,384
Oh no, folks, this is not part of the tour.

809
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:14,512
Sorry, Emily.

810
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:15,960
That's quite all right, Dorrie.

811
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,071
It is not all right, Dorrie.

812
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,171
Richard, just ignore it and pass the carrots.

813
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:22,801
This is lunacy. I feel as if I was in a zoo.

814
00:36:22,954 --> 00:36:24,352
Well, Dad, you know what monkeys do

815
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:25,862
when they don't like people staring at them in the zoo.

816
00:36:25,954 --> 00:36:27,606
- No, I don't. 
- And you don't want to.

817
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:29,123
- How do you know? 
- I can just tell.

818
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:32,641
Don't play that piano! Don't you see the sign?

819
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,387
There was supposed to be a sign.

820
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,358
- There is a sign. 
- It's not a very good sign.

821
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:39,942
The house was built in 1906 by Stanford White.

822
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:40,818
That's it.

823
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:45,810
The house was built in 1907, and he was a protégé of Stanford White.

824
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,880
I'm getting a migraine.

825
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:50,074
So, you're a full-fledged newspaper-woman now.

826
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:51,948
- Yes, I am. 
- Congratulations.

827
00:36:52,062 --> 00:36:52,774
Thank you.

828
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:54,233
Now you gotta get yourself a nickname like

829
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:55,881
Smitty and start talking really fast.

830
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:57,141
Faster than I already do?

831
00:36:57,376 --> 00:36:58,400
Hey, whatever it takes.

832
00:36:58,554 --> 00:37:00,090
What where you going to do, hit the man?

833
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,592
- He went into my desk! 
- He was 85 years old.

834
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:05,527
It's never too late to learn a lesson.

835
00:37:06,178 --> 00:37:08,824
- This is it, Emily. I mean it. 
- I know you do, Richard.

836
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,245
The next time you plan a function, we will rent a hall and do it properly,

837
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:14,579
like the fibromyalgia function last night.

838
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:16,351
That is the proper way to raise money.

839
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:18,660
You went to a function last night, you had a function tonight...

840
00:37:18,742 --> 00:37:21,169
We didn't host the one last night. We were just guests.

841
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:22,540
- Was it fun? 
- It was fine.

842
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,041
It wasn't here. It was perfect.

843
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:25,465
The food was terrible.

844
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:28,736
The fact that people still insist on serving paella is simply beyond me.

845
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:30,478
However, the room looked lovely.

846
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:31,671
And the music was excellent.

847
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:34,420
And the guest list was very good - a lovely group of people, except for...

848
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:35,168
Emily!

849
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:37,722
Would it have hurt the woman to buy an undergarment?

850
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:38,818
Who?

851
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:40,159
She was a very nice girl.

852
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:42,376
I wouldn't request to see her thesis on anything,

853
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:44,092
but she was charming and a good dancer.

854
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,457
Who's the dumb girl without the underwear?

855
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:47,854
Jason's date.

856
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:51,838
Jason brought a date?

857
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:53,606
And I had to sit next to her all night.

858
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:55,371
Oh, the fascinating time we had.

859
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:58,059
I know all the best places to get my acrylics filled.

860
00:37:58,202 --> 00:38:00,307
Your mother is a snob. She was quite beautiful.

861
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,177
She was, huh?

862
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:03,128
She's perfect for Jason, I will say that.

863
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,345
So, how beautiful was she?

864
00:38:05,606 --> 00:38:08,207
Are we talking Catherine Zeta-Jones or the weird-looking Hilton sister?

865
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:10,440
She looks like exactly the kind of gold digger

866
00:38:10,553 --> 00:38:13,133
who would latch onto an immature little con artist like Jason.

867
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,046
My goodness, Emily, tell us how you really feel about the boy.

868
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,217
But when you say gold digger,

869
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:19,737
do you mean she was cheap-looking?

870
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:20,741
- Yes. 
- No.

871
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,082
So is he serious about this girl?

872
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,364
Oh, who can tell? She looks like a perfectly fine first wife for him.

873
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:28,212
Now the old man is just baiting me.

874
00:38:28,657 --> 00:38:30,771
What did I tell you about the piano?

875
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,489
You know, we don't have to put the reception area over there.

876
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:36,029
I just want to know where my office is going to be.

877
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:38,334
Fonzie used the bathroom as his office.

878
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:40,617
Yeah, what are you saying, that what's good enough for the Fonz

879
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:41,938
- isn't good enough for you? 
- Yeah.

880
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,735
Fonzie used that bathroom office only intermittently

881
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,957
and not for any business for which he was paid.

882
00:38:46,295 --> 00:38:48,938
He had use of a private office at the auto shop he worked at,

883
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:53,146
then access to the teachers' lounge where he taught night school part time.

884
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:55,869
Oh my God, you're taking this Fonzie thing way too seriously.

885
00:38:56,014 --> 00:38:57,190
Lorelai, am I interrupting?

886
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:58,732
Oh, hey, what are you doing here?

887
00:38:58,875 --> 00:38:59,797
I was on my way to New York,

888
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:01,829
and I wanted to see this inn you're always talking about.

889
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:04,553
- Oh, sure. 
- Hello, I'm Sookie.

890
00:39:04,688 --> 00:39:07,210
Sookie's my partner here.

891
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,289
Hi, Sookie, I'm Jason Stiles.

892
00:39:09,535 --> 00:39:10,917
Yes, you are.

893
00:39:11,378 --> 00:39:13,148
Michel Gerard.

894
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:15,131
And Michel is the manager of the Dragonfly.

895
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,124
It's nice to meet you.

896
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:19,114
Okay, so, I'm just gonna show Jason around.

897
00:39:19,222 --> 00:39:21,285
- Take your time. 
- Follow me.

898
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,708
- Your friends seem really nice. 
- Oh, they're the best.

899
00:39:26,026 --> 00:39:27,723
So, who do they think I am?

900
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,017
What do you mean?

901
00:39:29,237 --> 00:39:31,352
Did you tell 'em we're dating or do they think I make your hats?

902
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:32,591
They know who you are.

903
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:34,080
This place is really great.

904
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:35,463
- Yeah, you think? 
- I do.

905
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:37,045
Good, that's good.

906
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:41,150
You seem a little distracted. Did I come at a bad time?

907
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:43,727
- No, you came at a perfect time. 
- Perfect time for...

908
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:45,351
I heard you went to a function the other night.

909
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:47,768
Ah, fibromyalgia - a very dull disease.

910
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:49,543
- I also heard you didn't go alone. 
- No, I didn't.

911
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,805
- So, you brought a date? 
- Yes, I did.

912
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,365
Okay, good. That's good, I'm glad.

913
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:58,288
My mother said she didn't wear any underwear.

914
00:39:58,431 --> 00:39:59,573
Emily didn't wear any underwear?

915
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,447
Your date didn't wear any underwear.

916
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,675
Oh, I don't know that for a fact, but if Emily said so,

917
00:40:03,762 --> 00:40:05,138
far be it from me to call her a liar.

918
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:10,499
Okay. Hey, you wanna see the stables?

919
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,292
- Sure. 
- Well, there they are.

920
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:14,207
Well, tour's over. Bathroom's to the left.

921
00:40:14,607 --> 00:40:16,249
You wanna tell me what you're bothered about?

922
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:20,853
We're sleeping together, and you're taking bare-butted women to functions?

923
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:22,563
Crystal is just a friend...

924
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,831
A friend named Crystal?

925
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,659
Who are you, Hugh Hefner?

926
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:29,756
Wow, wait a sec. I would have much rather taken you to that function.

927
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:32,382
Trust me, Crystal is very sweet, but the mocking of the sick

928
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:34,492
is completely beyond her capabilities.

929
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:38,316
But you told me in no uncertain terms that your parents were not supposed to know about us,

930
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:40,953
and since this is a function your parents would be attending,

931
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:42,853
I thought taking you would be out of the question.

932
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,196
Well, you could've gone alone.

933
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:45,879
You don't go to these things alone.

934
00:40:46,022 --> 00:40:47,841
There are two seats and you're expected to fill them.

935
00:40:47,963 --> 00:40:50,764
You could've told me so I wasn't blindsided by my parents.

936
00:40:50,964 --> 00:40:53,421
See, this is what I mean about keeping secrets. It never works.

937
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:56,262
Let's just tell your parents, then we never have to have this conversation again.

938
00:40:57,184 --> 00:40:59,442
Lorelai, I am in a business where there are lots of functions.

939
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,463
I have to go to those functions, and I don't want to take other people,

940
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:05,320
but I'm gonna have to if you won't let me say something to your father.

941
00:41:06,052 --> 00:41:11,161
I have no interest in spending a second of my time with any other woman but you.

942
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:12,268
And Eartha Kitt.

943
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:13,982
Well, sure.

944
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:15,196
So, what do you say?

945
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,606
Can we end the madness and tell your parents?

946
00:41:18,678 --> 00:41:19,733
- No. 
- No?

947
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:21,926
I know it's tricky to keep this a secret,

948
00:41:22,037 --> 00:41:24,705
but I just don't think it's time to tell them yet.

949
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:28,340
And if that means that I have to adjust, then I have to adjust.

950
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:31,684
And now that you've told me how you feel,

951
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:35,678
I think it's fine if you take Crystal to these functions.

952
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,489
Well, it's fine for you - you don't have to talk to the woman.

953
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:38,509
Oh, sorry.

954
00:41:38,642 --> 00:41:39,415
Hey, maybe you don't understand.

955
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:41,688
It's like beating your head against a wall with spikes.

956
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,397
Wanna see the apple trees?

957
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:46,613
She thinks that Babe can really talk.

958
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:53,483
Contemporary Political Fiction?

959
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,872
- Yes. 
- Oh, good.

960
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,364
I swore this semester would be different. I would get to class on time.

961
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:00,651
I would finish my assignments on time. I would do everything on time.

962
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:02,532
I left my purse on the bench.

963
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:08,856
I haven't started speaking yet.

964
00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:13,499
Asher Fleming is teaching this course?

965
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:14,645
I know. Isn't it cool?

966
00:42:17,107 --> 00:42:20,738
Ah, Rory Gilmore.

967
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:23,140
- We meet again. 
- Hello, Professor Fleming.

968
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:25,449
- You're taking this class? 
- Yes, I am.

969
00:42:25,592 --> 00:42:27,236
Wonderful. I look forward to it.

970
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:30,462
After all, it seems very natural, doesn't it?

971
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,039
Especially since you and I have someone very important in common.

972
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:36,970
Your grandfather.

973
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:39,474
Good man.

974
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,423
Yes, sir. Very good.

975
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,338
All right, well, let's get settled.

976
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:47,956
The class is Contemporary Political Fiction. I am Professor Fleming.

977
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:50,618
All those in the wrong class, please leave.

978
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:52,493
How do you know you're in the wrong class?

979
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:54,844
If you do not enjoy a good argument,

980
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:57,438
if you find it difficult to voice a differing opinion,

981
00:42:57,598 --> 00:43:01,510
and if you cannot appreciate an intelligently cloaked insult,

982
00:43:02,222 --> 00:43:03,855
then you're in the wrong class.

983
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:08,156
If all of these things appeal to you, then you are in for an interesting semester.

984
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:09,880
I'll be handing out the reading lists.
