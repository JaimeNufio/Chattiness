1
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:04,769
This feels so decadent. Isn't this decadent?

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:05,701
Very decadent.

3
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:06,934
Are there more marshmallows?

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,690
All you two have been dipping is the marshmallows! You haven't touched the kiwi, or the pineapple, or the tangelo slices.

5
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:12,605
But it's fruit.

6
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:13,668
Fruit is good for you.

7
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:15,018
We're fondue purists, Grandma.

8
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:16,114
Yeah, we dip old school.

9
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:19,823
The government says you should have nine servings of fruit and vegetables per day.

10
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:21,018
Imperialist propaganda.

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,520
I think Noam Chomsky would agree.

12
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,860
I bet Noam doesn’t dip fruit.

13
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,440
Or laugh. Ever seen that punim on him?

14
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:26,332
Easter Island.

15
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:28,672
Luminista, please bring more marshmallows.

16
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:29,182
Bless you.

17
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,396
So, I’d love to get your opinion on something.

18
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:32,068
Sure.

19
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:34,135
The City Ballet is in trouble.

20
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,421
We’ve given so much over the years,
but it’s never enough to cover everything they need.

21
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:38,280
I hate that.

22
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,526
So, we’re trying something new.

23
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:45,381
Select patrons, such as myself, are sponsoring individual dancers.

24
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:46,554
Help me pick one.

25
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:47,060
Pick what?

26
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,989
My dancer! I get to take one home.

27
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:50,035
Bios are on the back.

28
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,006
And this is legal?

29
00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:52,232
Of course it’s legal.

30
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,679
Do you want a boy or a girl, Grandma?

31
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:55,743
I’m thinking a little girl. Cute and petite.

32
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,614
They’re all petite.

33
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:58,008
But not all cute.

34
00:00:58,036 --> 00:01:00,687
This one should fouetter over to the dermatologist.

35
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,076
Oh, yes, I’d rather not look at that.

36
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:03,907
Really, Mom, this is a little bit creepy.

37
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:07,716
It’s not creepy! We’re endowing dancers so that they don’t have to worry about money.

38
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:08,428
It’s nice.

39
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:11,565
Well, Gregorio here looks pretty well-endowed already.

40
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:12,411
Stop that!

41
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:14,236
Here’s a little cutie patootie.

42
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:15,634
Oh, she’s darling!

43
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:16,692
Look at those little feet!

44
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:18,061
Whoa, you were right!

45
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:19,941
This Gregorio guy, what’s up with that?

46
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:20,700
Rory!

47
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:22,834
Just a little girl talk, Mom. Who are we offending?

48
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:23,942
Let’s make two piles.

49
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,337
One for the maybes, one for the nos.

50
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:26,531
Sandpaper face is a no?

51
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:27,241
Definitely.

52
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:28,523
What about Endowment Boy?

53
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:30,975
The maybes.

54
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:31,872
You go, Grandma.

55
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,050
I bet Gregorio would be good dipped in chocolate.

56
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:34,422
"Blame Booze and Melville"

57
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:39,178
I don’t know. Adopting a ballet dancer? The whole thing sounds very shady.

58
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,516
It’s good to support the arts any way we can, even the shady-sounding ways.

59
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,272
Hey, you took my book bag! I need that!

60
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:45,081
Oops, sorry.

61
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:51,266
So you really think that transferring your stuff bit by bit like this is the way to go, huh? Easier than renting something, doing it all at once?

62
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:54,714
Oh, you really want to re-live the U-haul incident of May 2004?

63
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:56,268
Ah! You make one iffy u-turn.

64
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,201
We were in a tunnel!

65
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,123
A wide tunnel.

66
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,467
Going the wrong way down a one-way street.

67
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:00,550
They don’t let you forget.

68
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:03,379
Yeah, I’ve got that elephant’s memory when it comes to nearly dying.

69
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:05,445
Hey, you took my book bag again!

70
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:06,204
Ah!

71
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:09,177
So, hey. Let’s finalize our plans for Thursday.

72
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:09,626
Right

73
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,845
So Jackson says that Sookie has been napping between eleven and twelve-thirty every day. We can count on it.

74
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,927
Must be nice to nap without feeling guilty.

75
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:17,284
Get pregnant and you’ll have an excuse.

76
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:17,882
No thanks.

77
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,184
So, meet me at their house at noon. Bring decorations

78
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,361
and she’ll wake up to a nice, fun, surprise baby shower.

79
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:22,797
You got it.

80
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:24,664
I think it’s cool we waited this long to throw it.

81
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,020
She’s totally not going to expect it.

82
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:26,780
Plus we forgot.

83
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:27,517
But only we know that.

84
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:28,239
And I’m not telling.

85
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:29,023
Good. Bye, hon.

86
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:29,621
Bye!

87
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:32,484
Mom, my purse!

88
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,816
Oh, sorry.

89
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,987
Luke, can I have a word with you?

90
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:39,814
Yes.

91
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:42,652
You overcharged me for the toast. It’s only supposed to be a dollar.

92
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:45,428
I didn’t overcharge you, Kirk. I raised the price of wheat toast.

93
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:46,473
It’s a dollar ten.

94
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:47,508
You’re kidding.

95
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:49,139
I don’t do toast humor.

96
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,790
A dollar ten from a dollar? That’s a ten percent bump.

97
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:52,798
It’s a dime, Kirk.

98
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:53,981
I could refuse to pay.

99
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:55,338
Then I’ll steal your bike.

100
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,357
That’s never worked before.

101
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,884
I haven’t raised the price of my toast in seven years,

102
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,004
Kirk. It’s still a bargain.

103
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,299
I’ll give you a dollar four.

104
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:02,618
No.

105
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:04,507
A dollar five. That’s my last offer.

106
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,665
Do I look like E-bay?

107
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:08,279
I take my toast dry. Isn’t there a butter and jam discount?

108
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:08,578
No.

109
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:09,614
What about your chairs?

110
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:12,813
I’m light, and I tend to plop my butt directly on the chair without sliding,

111
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:14,282
so there’s practically no wear and tear.

112
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:16,460
There’s no discount for direct butt-plopping.

113
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:16,958
What about -

114
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:19,570
Fine. A dollar five. It’s a dollar five. You got it.

115
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:20,952
Thanks. That’s very nice of you.

116
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:21,749
Hey!

117
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:25,384
You raise something from a dollar to a dollar ten,

118
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:26,417
is that such a big deal?

119
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:29,913
Well, that’s ten percent, so percentage-wise it’s not so tiny -

120
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,792
Did I step into something here?

121
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:35,401
You know, I shouldn’t have gotten into a business that involves dealing with people.

122
00:04:35,463 --> 00:04:35,824
Hey.

123
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:37,405
Hey! Your cover!

124
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,060
I got an advance copy!

125
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:40,504
Oh, look at the inn! It looks beautiful.

126
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:41,313
I know.

127
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:42,930
I’ve got to get a new pair of pants.

128
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,809
Okay. That didn’t exactly follow.

129
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:46,490
You know, for the party they’re going to throw you.

130
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,780
You don’t need new pants. You just need pants.

131
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,775
And the party’s in New York, so you may not even need pants.

132
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,621
I’ve got to get a copy.

133
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:52,642
You’ve got a connection.

134
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,968
I want to get a bunch, though. Frame one or two of them.

135
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,673
How’s the article? What’s it say?

136
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:59,648
It was then, sadly, that I discovered Luke could not read.

137
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:00,585
You know what I mean.

138
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,340
People are going to think I wrote it.

139
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,946
I mean, it’s big.

140
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,253
I nearly cried when I read it.

141
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:05,614
Good.

142
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:09,575
And the fact that when Emily Gilmore reads it, she’s going to hire men to attack me with tire irons,

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,094
well, that’s something else altogether.

144
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,800
What’d they put in?

145
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,000
Not every heinous thing I said about her, but enough.

146
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,740
I mean, it’s good stuff, it’s funny.

147
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,408
Maybe if I just told them not the face.

148
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:17,794
Who?

149
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,250
The guys, with the tire irons.

150
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:21,726
I think you should just show it to her and get it over with.

151
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,132
Mm, maybe.

152
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:24,103
Yeah.

153
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:25,647
You’re probably right.

154
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:26,668
Hello.

155
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:27,838
Hold on.

156
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,529
Hey, Luke, it’s for you. It’s Taylor.

157
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,761
Caesar!

158
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:36,064
You just broke Luke’s standing ‘when Taylor calls I’m out even if he can see me through the stupid connecting window’ rule.

159
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:37,357
I can tell him you’re out,

160
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:39,709
and that Duke, your evil identical twin is in town.

161
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:43,152
No, no. I’ll take it. I actually have to discuss something with him.

162
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:43,911
Hello.

163
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:44,695
Luke!

164
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,791
Hey, buddy!

165
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:47,312
Hey. Buddy.

166
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:51,747
So the powers that be have signed off on you purchasing the Twickham house!

167
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:54,273
All that’s left is dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s.

168
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:56,679
Okay. Fine.

169
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,629
Ooh, sorry. Lorelai’s there, can’t talk now, right?

170
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:00,677
Pretty much.

171
00:06:00,678 --> 00:06:03,130
You know I’m a bit of a romantic, Luke.

172
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:06,640
The thought of you buying this house for your burgeoning family is quite touching.

173
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,134
I almost tear up.

174
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:10,435
Heh. Adds to the tax base, too.

175
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:11,232
Well, good.

176
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:11,991
Talk to you later.

177
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:13,024
Goodbye!

178
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:13,995
Wow.

179
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:16,707
You and Taylor seem to be getting on very well these days.

180
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:20,155
Yeah, well. He’s been cooperating with me on certain matters.

181
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,981
Luke! I think the sales tax is off by a penny!

182
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:24,428
In fact, I’m sure of it.

183
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,282
I’m ready to go to the mat on this one.

184
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:29,240
Those guys with the tire irons. Where did your mother get them?

185
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:31,904
The D.A.R. And they don’t work for outsiders.

186
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:34,770
Show me the penny, Kirk.

187
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Hey, Pete. Hey, Lance. This goes to metro, a. s.a. p.

188
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:43,038
Okay.

189
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,123
Rory, if you see Patel, tell him I’m looking for him.

190
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:45,845
Got it.

191
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,289
Need ‘em back by five, gentlemen.

192
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:48,111
Thanks, beautiful.

193
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:49,318
Manners, boys.

194
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:51,272
Rory, you got those obituaries?

195
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:52,218
Yeah, just give me five minutes.

196
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:52,928
Lot of dying today.

197
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:53,827
I hear that.

198
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:54,860
Thank you!

199
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:57,113
Oh, Patel. Charlie wants to see you.

200
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:57,788
You remember Audrey?

201
00:06:57,813 --> 00:06:58,274
I can.

202
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:58,847
Give her this.

203
00:06:58,921 --> 00:06:59,930
Okay, will do.

204
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:01,912
Hey, Ace!

205
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:02,932
Hey! You’re early.

206
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,725
Well, there’s a first for everything. Where’s the fire?

207
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,438
Oh, just south of the ninety-five.

208
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:08,193
It’s a four-alarm. We’ve got Kessler on it.

209
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:09,508
This is from Patel.

210
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:10,441
I’m not talking to him.

211
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,549
I’ll tell him.

212
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:13,068
How did you know about the fire?

213
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,373
I didn’t. I meant where are you going in such a hurry?

214
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,037
Oh. I’m at half-speed compared to this morning.

215
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,145
Oh, no.

216
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:19,555
What?

217
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:22,690
I’m gone for five minutes and this place becomes a dumping ground.

218
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:25,018
I’m loving the totally non-generic feel of your space, here.

219
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:26,677
I have customized it somewhat.

220
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:27,461
Eccentric uncle?

221
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:28,096
Brian Eno.

222
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,527
I was close. So let’s go.

223
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:30,274
It’s four-thirty.

224
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:31,656
So cut out early. There’s nothing going on here.

225
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,061
We’re doing our rough front page.

226
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,500
We’re picking our leads, our photos. It’s our busiest part of the day.

227
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,488
So the people of Stamford don’t get their paper tomorrow, they’ll turn on the radio.

228
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:39,151
I can’t go.

229
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:39,960
I know the boss.

230
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:40,507
So do I.

231
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:42,412
But I know how to work the boss. At least a little.

232
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:43,769
I know he’s somewhere in the vicinity.

233
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:44,341
Who, your dad?

234
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:46,896
Can’t you sense it? The flurry, the shuffle of sycophants -

235
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:49,635
Hey! Someone new. Have we been introduced?

236
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:52,194
Jose Canseco, post-steroids. Should be a warning to people.

237
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,439
Are you keeping Rory from her work?

238
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:54,985
I was just about to call security.

239
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,056
Does everyone know about the -

240
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:58,185
Noon on Friday, main conference room, come with your game.

241
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:58,832
Good.

242
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:00,623
You call your mother about the Vineyard?

243
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,519
She’s on my list.

244
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:02,614
Push him on that, won’t you?

245
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:04,208
I’m going to four if you want to catch up.

246
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:04,656
Okay.

247
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:05,154
See you.

248
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:05,950
Enjoy four.

249
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:06,610
What’s four?

250
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:07,593
Fourth floor.

251
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,185
You news people and your jargon.

252
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,417
We have our own language.

253
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:11,388
So he treating you all right?

254
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,347
Who, your dad?

255
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:13,231
They’ve been great.

256
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:13,865
You sure?

257
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:14,376
Yeah?

258
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,185
Just checking.

259
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:16,691
So what do you think about Friday.

260
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,468
An excellent alternative to Thursday.

261
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:19,727
My sister’s engagement party?

262
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:22,403
Oh, right. I’m going to try. I’m dying to see the yacht.

263
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:25,127
Well, it’s going to be full of Honor’s ditzy friends, but the harbor’s cool.

264
00:08:25,164 --> 00:08:28,351
Try and leave your grandparent’s dinner early. They get you every Friday night, why not let me have one?

265
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:29,524
You’re very one-note today.

266
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:30,420
Well, I miss you, Ace.

267
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:33,296
Well, I’ll have more free time once finals are over and summer’s here,

268
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,852
unless I get that summer job here.

269
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,317
Well, you’re probably a shoo-in. My father seems to like you.

270
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,672
Oh, I hope so! I love it here.

271
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,443
Okay.

272
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,199
So, I’ll just go hang somewhere till you’re done?

273
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:43,364
I’ll be done six-thirty, seven at the latest.

274
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:43,962
Ace!

275
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:44,796
Six forty-five.

276
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:48,891
So, maybe I’ll be hanging on two, or five. Is that the right terminology?

277
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:49,438
You’re getting it!

278
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,904
Come on! Please.

279
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:55,501
I’m done.

280
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:56,759
No, you can’t be done.

281
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:57,630
’m done!

282
00:08:57,642 --> 00:08:59,634
There’s more, I know it! It’s germinating.

283
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:01,089
I’m done, I’m at peace.

284
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:02,806
There is no more.

285
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,914
Just the smell of Manhattan!

286
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,618
I knew it. There was more.

287
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:09,029
I mean,

288
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:13,174
forget about the smells you can’t identify. The ones you can identify are putrid!

289
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:13,687
I mean,

290
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:18,940
if it’s not that rank smell of hot dog gushing out of those dirty sidewalk carts,

291
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:23,519
it’s the stench of the subway pouring out of the dirty grates! I mean, the manhole-cover steam?

292
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:26,848
God knows what that steam is. You can’t get a breath of fresh air!

293
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:28,247
Go, Luke! Rant, Luke!

294
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:30,899
The whole city is a decaying heap.

295
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:35,604
It’s too many people crammed into too many buildings on too small a piece of land.

296
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:37,631
It’s an experiment that’s failed.

297
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:41,577
They should just give the whole island a push and float it over to Europe.

298
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,605
But after we see Spamalot! Right? I paid a lot for those tickets.

299
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,560
I’m fine with an urban environment.

300
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:49,149
But you need land around your space.

301
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,817
Air to breathe.

302
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:54,537
I’m done again.

303
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:56,444
I love ranting Luke.

304
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,697
Why does this song keep playing?

305
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:03,826
Because I put the CD player on repeat with my fancy remote in my fancy limo.

306
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:05,542
Hey, do a limo rant. I bet that’s a good one.

307
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:07,496
No, that’s right they sent you a limo. You deserve it.

308
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:09,451
And it enabled us to drink and not drive.

309
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:10,409
That’s good too.

310
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:12,625
Hey, I heard there was good food at this party.

311
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:13,693
I heard that too.

312
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:15,660
Huh. Never made it to the food, did we?

313
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,001
I had three peppermints I took from the bowl in the men’s room,

314
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:19,893
gave the attendant a five, ‘cause it’s all I had.

315
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,148
Made it to the bar, though.

316
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:23,401
Yeah. We should’ve eaten something before we went

317
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,766
Who knew we’d keep missing the trays?

318
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:26,936
But I’m not hungry.

319
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,714
But I’m something, what am I?

320
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:29,535
You’re drunk.

321
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,328
I haven’t been drunk in years.

322
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:38,301
Hey, have I thanked you enough for escorting me,

323
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,571
and being such a good sport and shaking hands with all the big city folk you don’t like,

324
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:45,905
and putting extra cherries in my Manhattan?

325
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:46,939
Yeah. You did.

326
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,460
There’ll be more thanking.

327
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:50,879
Later on tonight.

328
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:56,789
Tastes like peppermint.

329
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:54,003
Hi, you’re late.

330
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:54,924
Sorry

331
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:57,152
Oh, it’s only a little after noon. I’m not that late.

332
00:11:57,211 --> 00:12:00,510
Well, we have very limited time during Sookie’s nap, here. I just don’t want to blow it.

333
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:01,157
Hold on.

334
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,949
You went to Doose’s for baby shower decorations?

335
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:03,972
Well, I didn’t know where else to go.

336
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:04,968
A decoration store.

337
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:05,715
Is there such a thing?

338
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:06,823
Yes. What did you get?

339
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:08,665
Um, poppers. Taylor had nine left.

340
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:10,635
Okay, well, there’s ten of us, so someone doesn’t get to pop.

341
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:13,610
Well, I’ll pass on the pop. And there’s plates, and cups, and -

342
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:15,612
Chicks being hatched? That’s Easter.

343
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:19,023
No, I know, but I figured hatching is birth, so we’re right on topic there.

344
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,375
Seventy percent off, too.

345
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:20,947
What else?

346
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:24,732
Uh, New Year’s Eve balloons with Father Time and the New Year’s baby on them.

347
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:28,165
We’ll blow them up and cheat the old man side to the wall so we can’t see it,

348
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:31,240
and then change the word ‘year’ so it says ‘happy new baby’.

349
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:32,348
Oh, that’s just sad.

350
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:33,546
Hey, what’s with the attitude?

351
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:34,143
No attitude.

352
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:35,600
You’ve been Anne Sexton since I pulled up.

353
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:37,350
Sorry. Think I just slept a little funny.

354
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,329
All right. Come on, let’s get up in there while we still have the chance.

355
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:39,628
Okay.

356
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:40,437
Look out!

357
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:41,446
Coming through!

358
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,137
It’s happening! It’s happening!

359
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:44,157
Oh my God, it’s happening?

360
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:45,440
You mean it’s happening, happening?

361
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:46,647
It’s coming round the mountain.

362
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:47,942
Oh, I can’t watch this!

363
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,410
Go get her suitcase! It’s by the front door.

364
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:50,718
I’ll grab her suitcase!

365
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:52,267
Oh, I’m freaking out Rory!

366
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,524
It’s okay. She’s a traditionalist.

367
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:56,537
When she has a baby, she’s going to be out in the waiting room, pacing and smoking.

368
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,739
We should have thrown her the baby shower earlier! Then I wouldn’t have had to watch this.

369
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,900
Oh, you guys were going to throw me a baby shower?

370
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:03,306
We were going to set it up during your nap.

371
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:03,829
Want a boost?

372
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:05,198
I can make it.

373
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:05,592
Oh, God.

374
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:06,202
Watch it.

375
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:09,048
Sorry, I just really don’t want to see what’s coming round the mountain.

376
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:09,919
See you guys at the hospital?

377
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:11,027
Yeah, you’ll see me.

378
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:12,433
Yeah, I have to go back to Yale.

379
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,610
Plus she’s thoroughly sickened by what’s happening to you right now.

380
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,552
I’m not sickened, it’s finals time. I’m stressed.

381
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:18,058
Ooh! Contraction!

382
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:19,169
Oh, that’s pretty sickening.

383
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:19,767
Hang on.

384
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,347
Sorry you didn’t get your party.

385
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,717
One little no-name to come.

386
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:23,277
We’ll see you there.

387
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:23,874
See you there.

388
00:13:23,924 --> 00:13:24,497
Mm-hm.

389
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:32,965
You are going to open your eyes when you drive back to Yale, right?

390
00:13:33,014 --> 00:13:33,375
Yes.

391
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:37,010
I’m just giving them a five minute head start. We’re taking the same road.

392
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:37,894
Good thinking, honey.

393
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,101
Bye.

394
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:47,068
I know he wants the bone.

395
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,458
I know there’s going to be a complication getting the bone,

396
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:52,302
but Marmaduke still cracks me up every time.

397
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:53,821
Refills are still free, right?

398
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:55,389
Yep. They’re still free.

399
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:01,243
Luke’s.

400
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:02,711
Luke, it’s Taylor.

401
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:04,806
Oh, hey, Taylor, how’s it going?

402
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:05,801
Not so well.

403
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:07,983
I mean, for you. It’s going very well for me.

404
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:12,203
I just had a group of German tourists come in and they’ve been shoveling it in since they sat down.

405
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,297
What do you mean, it’s not going well for me?

406
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:17,479
It’s the Twickham house. Someone has put in a competing offer.

407
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,412
A competing -

408
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:19,645
Taylor!

409
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:21,475
You promised that house to me!

410
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:26,987
And I did all that I could! But this other offer includes a substantial down payment in cash!

411
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,426
The powers that be are seriously considering selling the house to this fellow townsman of yours!

412
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:33,217
I’ll up my offer.

413
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:36,802
This guy’ll just up his, then! He’s got vast resources!

414
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:39,304
How many resources can he have? He’s living in Stars Hollow!

415
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:43,066
Luke, he’s willing to put down a quarter of a million dollars!

416
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,411
What? That can’t be right!

417
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:45,543
That’s what it is.

418
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:47,210
I know everyone in this stinking town.

419
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:50,409
What fellow townsman has a quarter of a million dollars in cash?

420
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,259
I’m not sure I’m at liberty to say.

421
00:14:52,582 --> 00:14:53,553
Tell me, Taylor.

422
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:54,636
Okay.

423
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:56,815
Say that name again?

424
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:01,369
I’ll talk to you later.

425
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:10,816
Sally Forth is on fire today.

426
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:11,650
On fire!

427
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,405
Where did you get a quarter of a million dollars!

428
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,239
What?

429
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:16,181
I don’t have a quarter of a million dollars.

430
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:17,591
You don’t?

431
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:18,127
No.

432
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:18,948
Just shy.

433
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:21,749
It’s $247, 868.

434
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,801
Sixty-seven, if I get a couple of donuts to go.

435
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:25,556
Those chocolate raised are calling my name.

436
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,137
Where the hell did you get that much money?

437
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,104
I’ve been working for eleven years, Luke.

438
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:31,245
I’ve had fifteen thousand jobs.

439
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,447
I’ve saved every dollar I’ve ever made.

440
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:37,368
That and the miracle of compound interest has created a bounty of a quarter of a million dollars.

441
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:39,235
Again, just under. I don’t want to brag.

442
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,394
You put a competing offer on the Twickham house.

443
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:41,904
That’s right.

444
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:43,129
It’s the perfect place for me and Lulu.

445
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:44,897
You know I have an offer on that house.

446
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:46,129
I’ve heard talk to that effect.

447
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,160
Take it back.

448
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,219
Take back the offer.

449
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:49,451
No. You take yours back.

450
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:52,252
I had a deal with Taylor before you even knew that house was available!

451
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:53,011
You get it in writing?

452
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:53,833
No! But -

453
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,268
Mm.

454
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,923
An oral agreement’s only as good as the paper it’s written on.

455
00:15:56,985 --> 00:16:01,317
Hey, that would be a good line for Dennis the Menace after he fails to mow Mr. Wilson’s lawn.

456
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:02,179
I should send that in.

457
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:03,511
This is not going to go down this way.

458
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:04,855
You are not getting that house.

459
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,085
Au contraire, my friend.

460
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,463
I happen to know that your credit’s not exactly stellar.

461
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:09,235
My credit?

462
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:11,359
Granted, you’ve got some real estate holdings,

463
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,662
but your cash flow’s been flat for three years,

464
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:15,566
and unless you’re willing to sell off assets,

465
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:20,506
you may be able to swing no more than a five percent down payment, which makes you a real estate risk.

466
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:22,684
How do you know the state of my assets?

467
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:24,415
That’s the power of deep pockets, Luke.

468
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:27,368
Put a solid buck in the right hands and they babble like parrots.

469
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,214
Well,

470
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:31,454
I am one of Stars Hollow Bank’s oldest customers.

471
00:16:31,503 --> 00:16:33,707
I’m not anticipating any problems.

472
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:36,112
Well, I’m Stars Hollow Bank’s biggest customer.

473
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:37,120
I think that means more.

474
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:41,535
I don’t believe this! You’re swimming in cash and you fought me over a ten cent raise on toast!

475
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:43,414
And you folded like a road map.

476
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:45,851
That might explain the discrepancy in our net worths.

477
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:46,474
So,

478
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:49,262
I think I will have those donuts to go.

479
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:50,905
You’ve got change for a hundred, right?

480
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:57,613
Das ist gut, ya?

481
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,436
I want to talk to the town elders!

482
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:00,984
The town elders?

483
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:03,237
You keep talking about the powers that be. That’s the town elders,

484
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:03,499
right?

485
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:03,798
Yes.

486
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,586
Well, they oversee the town assets, the real estate, I want to see them.

487
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:07,709
They won’t go for that, Luke.

488
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:08,257
Why?

489
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,896
It isn’t how it’s done! They don’t deal with the public.

490
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,940
They’re the final arbiters. What they say goes.

491
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:13,749
I’m seeing them.

492
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:14,048
But -

493
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,343
Arrange it.

494
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:21,911
Are you breathing, honey?

495
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:24,685
I’m breathing. Hey, was that Andy Dick out in the hallway?

496
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,801
No, honey. This happened last time.

497
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,402
You go into labor, you start thinking you see famous people.

498
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:30,396
Right.

499
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:32,251
Suddenly my midwife was Wolf Blitzer.

500
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,608
Hey, you need me to unpack you?

501
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,077
You probably don’t have to.

502
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:36,894
We have everything she needs all set up.

503
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:38,996
You know, we guys always pack a suitcase.

504
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:41,486
Useless. So, have you been thinking about names?

505
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,527
I’m leaning toward Ethan for a boy.

506
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,909
Or Glenda if it’s a girl.

507
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:46,677
Although I like Martha, too.

508
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:47,919
And Rupert for a boy.

509
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:49,202
They’re all good, sweetie.

510
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,545
Hey, whatever we don’t use, we just save for the next one, right?

511
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,300
Right, right. The next one.

512
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:54,453
Hey, will you stay with her?

513
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,917
I’ve got to go call my most delivery guys and let them know what’s happening.

514
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,143
Yep. I’ll be here.

515
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,326
Comfortable?

516
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:00,894
I am, Penelope Cruz.

517
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:03,476
Really?

518
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:03,849
What?

519
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:05,144
You’re eating an apple?

520
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:06,152
Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll put it away.

521
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:09,065
No, eat! I’m just surprised, it’s not your thing.

522
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:12,396
I know! But we were by a vending machine checking you in. It was there, and it looked good.

523
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:13,308
It does look good.

524
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,088
Oh, it looks like Ben Stiller.

525
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:15,623
Hm.

526
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:19,517
Um, hey, Sookie, um,

527
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:20,800
when did you know for sure?

528
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:21,609
About what?

529
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,389
That you were pregnant. How could you tell?

530
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:25,231
Don’t you remember? ‘Norman Mailer!’

531
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:25,766
Mm.

532
00:18:25,913 --> 00:18:27,108
Right, right. Norman Mailer.

533
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,751
I wonder how Norman is.

534
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:32,585
I had a dream about him the other night, and he was yelling at someone to shut up and read Joyce.

535
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:36,895
How long was the Norman Mailer moment after you and Jackson, uh, conceived?

536
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:37,704
Wow.

537
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:41,080
Uh, well, I don’t know, a few weeks?

538
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,275
It was weeks?

539
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:43,022
I think.

540
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:45,587
And you didn’t know before? Not a feeling, or anything?

541
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:48,037
I don’t know. You’ve had one before, don’t you remember?

542
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:49,381
Yeah. It’s been a while.

543
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:50,505
Why are you asking?

544
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:51,513
Oh, I don’t know.

545
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:54,488
Just being in a maternity ward makes me wonder about these things.

546
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,339
I’m going to see how far along she is. We’ll be a couple of minutes.

547
00:18:57,391 --> 00:18:57,914
Oh, sure.

548
00:18:58,362 --> 00:18:59,507
She looks like Marlo Thomas.

549
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:00,727
See? It’s not just me.

550
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,387
I’ll be outside.

551
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:10,570
Oh, excuse me, uh, Doctor?

552
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,205
Yes.

553
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:12,774
Hi. You’re not off to save a life, are you?

554
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:13,707
Not at the moment.

555
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:14,959
Okay. Just, quick question.

556
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:15,631
Um,

557
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:16,640
pregnancy tests.

558
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:20,113
What’s the deal with them now? I haven’t taken one in a couple of decades, and

559
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:21,801
I was just wondering if they work any differently.

560
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,917
No, they’re more accurate now, but the process is similar.

561
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,249
Okay, so let’s say you do it.

562
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:25,912
Have sex.

563
00:19:25,949 --> 00:19:26,310
You know.

564
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:28,874
How soon after can a test tell you anything?

565
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:29,761
At least two weeks.

566
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:30,533
Not two days?

567
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:32,624
It won’t be definitive after just two days.

568
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:33,757
Boy.

569
00:19:33,954 --> 00:19:37,103
Sword of Damocles is really hovering over you for a couple weeks, there, huh?

570
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:37,788
Pretty much.

571
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:40,440
Home tests can be pretty tricky, too. Can’t buy one where I live,

572
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:43,754
because people would see, and talk - it’s a small town.

573
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:48,260
And even afterwards, the garbage man could see the box in the trash, and blab, and

574
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,030
you know, I like my garbage man, but again,

575
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,400
it’s a small town. It’s not your problem.

576
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:52,781
So, there’s no machine?

577
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:53,416
Machine?

578
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:55,081
Yeah, a machine you could stick me in.

579
00:19:55,131 --> 00:20:00,845
You know, putting pig vessels in people. Isn’t there a machine that could tell me right away, away from the prying eyes of the garbage man?

580
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,084
You really need to wait and take the test at the proper time.

581
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:03,843
Okay, see,

582
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:07,386
I’m eating an apple. Now, normally, this would not be a sign of anything except hunger.

583
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:09,079
Except I don’t eat much fruit.

584
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:09,788
I know I should,

585
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:11,344
but I don’t have a hankering for it.

586
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:14,069
Had it when I was pregnant with my first kid, though.

587
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:18,288
Kept craving those apples. And this morning, boy, was I craving an apple.

588
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,454
Well, that could be a sign.

589
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:19,840
It could?

590
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:20,450
Or not.

591
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:22,279
Okay.

592
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:25,402
You’re nice. You’re sweet. I’ve taken up too much of your time.

593
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:26,024
Thank you.

594
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:26,547
No problem.

595
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:27,045
Okay.

596
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:34,599
Hello?

597
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:36,865
Lorelai, it’s your mother. I just have a quick question.

598
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:37,400
Okay.

599
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:39,081
Well, I got my ballerina.

600
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:40,789
Oh, which one? Sachenka?

601
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:44,013
No, I waited too long, and Mitzi Hertford sure scooped her up.

602
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:48,696
It’s okay, because Sachenka tore a ligament last year and is probably washed up.

603
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:50,053
I got Paola.

604
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:51,209
Oh, Paola.

605
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:53,151
Blond hair, bullet body. So petite,

606
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,055
but thighs that could break concrete.

607
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:55,752
Sounds good.

608
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,817
They delivered her this morning and I have to tell you, it’s been so much fun!

609
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:03,100
She speaks this charming broken English, and everything is so new and fresh to her.

610
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,659
I’m glad. So what’s up?

611
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:05,057
Well,

612
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:07,783
Paola wandered into your room looking for the bathroom,

613
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:09,387
she really doesn’t know left from right,

614
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:12,237
and she found that old toy of yours, the magic eight ball.

615
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:13,328
I can’t believe that’s still there.

616
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:15,220
And she is mesmerized by it.

617
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:18,693
She’s been playing with it ever since, asking it questions. She won’t put it down.

618
00:21:18,975 --> 00:21:21,365
And I was just wondering if I can let her keep it?

619
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:22,127
Oh, sure.

620
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:23,621
It’s practically glued to her hand.

621
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,625
Hmm. Whatever Paola wants, Paola gets.

622
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,056
Good. Thank you!

623
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:28,251
It is yes!

624
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:30,154
Yes! I’m going to be rich!

625
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,918
I just want to hug the stuffing out of her!

626
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:34,573
You’ll meet her tomorrow night at dinner.

627
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,745
I’m looking forward to it.

628
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,052
Bye, and thanks again!

629
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:38,011
Bye, Mom.

630
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:46,725
Hey, how’s it going?

631
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:50,124
Oh, fine. She’s all checked in, breathing normally, contracting painfully.

632
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:52,663
The cursing should start any time now, everything’s as it should be.

633
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:53,223
Good.

634
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:54,879
I mean, that was weird, wasn’t it?

635
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:56,928
She was like, what, a week and a half early?

636
00:21:56,968 --> 00:21:59,097
Yeah, those little buggers tend to come when they want to come.

637
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:01,586
I still can’t get ‘coming round the mountain’ out of my mind.

638
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:05,503
It’s like one of those phrases, like ‘drop it like it’s hot’ that I really wish I’d never heard.

639
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,785
Hey, um.

640
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:10,301
You’re doing everything you need to do in that area, right?

641
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,185
What area?

642
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,143
Um, protection, to prevent something from coming round the mountain.

643
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,213
I hope so!

644
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:15,798
Hope?

645
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:17,827
This is not an area where hope is good enough.

646
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:20,265
I think I have it covered, and that wasn’t meant to be a euphemism.

647
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,000
Okay, ‘think’ is not good enough either. What kind of birth control do you use?

648
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:24,622
Um.

649
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:27,174
I’m in the dining hall!

650
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:28,268
That was not my question.

651
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:30,297
People are, like, three feet away from me.

652
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:30,882
Listen,

653
00:22:30,956 --> 00:22:33,770
all I’m saying is you cannot leave it up to the guy, okay?

654
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:34,877
They are not reliable.

655
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:36,494
I don’t leave it up to the guy!

656
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,851
They get into this state, you know?

657
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,361
Primordial. It’s all very exciting, but so is eating a gallon of pudding, and believe me,

658
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:44,394
you are going to regret that later. I use that as an example because I know you like pudding.

659
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:44,840
Okay.

660
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:47,466
You have got to figure, if he shoots, he scores.

661
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,831
I mean, look around you. There are babies popping out all over the place.

662
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:52,503
You are in a maternity ward! You’ve got a skewed sample there.

663
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,872
So you’re caught up on the subject?

664
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:54,930
You’ve caught me up.

665
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:57,879
Society has caught me up. The health channel on cable has caught me up.

666
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:01,563
Miss Driscoll, the sad spinster gym teacher at Stars Hollow High has caught me up -

667
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:03,799
Miss Driscoll. Right, like she would ever need birth control.

668
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,007
I’m caught up. Honest.

669
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,476
Okay. Good.

670
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:08,215
Mom. What’s going on with you?

671
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:09,037
Nothing.

672
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:09,759
Mom.

673
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:11,987
I might be pregnant.

674
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:13,132
Oh.

675
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:16,342
So,

676
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,110
that’s where this is coming from.

677
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,022
I blame Mom. She never sat me down for the talk.

678
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,711
And Miss Driscoll. She had her chance too, all those PTA meetings,

679
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:24,005
and all she ever talked about was golf.

680
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:25,574
How did this happen? I mean,

681
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:26,980
if it’s true?

682
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:31,360
Luke and I came home from the magazine party the other night. We were a little loopy and it got -

683
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:32,742
primordial.

684
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:37,570
All roadblocks down. I mean, I was always beyond careful. The last time I had my roadblocks down was,

685
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:38,230
I don’t know,

686
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:40,657
count how old you are to the day and add nine months.

687
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:41,855
But, that doesn’t mean -

688
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,187
I just ate an apple.

689
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:43,635
Uh oh.

690
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:44,967
Yeah, and I liked it.

691
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:45,502
Whoa.

692
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:47,046
My body is telling me something.

693
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:48,712
Maybe it’s not telling you what you think it is.

694
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:53,392
Maybe it’s just telling you to better comply with the government’s recommendations for fruit and vegetable intake.

695
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:54,986
That’s not just propaganda, you know.

696
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,533
Maybe.

697
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:55,919
And -

698
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:56,405
What?

699
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:59,851
Well, would it be so horrible? I mean, it’s Luke.

700
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:01,444
It is Luke?

701
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:02,951
Yes, it’s Luke!

702
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:03,610
Well,

703
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,036
you guys are so close, it could be headed somewhere.

704
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:07,866
I know, but not right now, hon.

705
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:08,860
It’s early for us.

706
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:09,745
You know? I mean,

707
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:14,855
my life is going really good, just the inn and this new potential opportunity, and,

708
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,496
you know.

709
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:17,189
I just got rid of you.

710
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:20,954
It’s the first time in my life I’ve gotten to feel like a single, grownup woman.

711
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:23,355
Now is just not the right time.

712
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,994
Okay. Well, maybe it’s not true.

713
00:24:26,193 --> 00:24:26,803
Yeah.

714
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:27,625
Maybe.

715
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:29,143
But what are you going to do if it is?

716
00:24:29,263 --> 00:24:32,524
I could really use my magic eight ball about now.

717
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,167
I’m going to let you go, hon.

718
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,137
Keep me posted.

719
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:36,282
Okay. Bye.

720
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:48,424
I’m early?

721
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:49,544
A little.

722
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:50,851
It’s not ten after twelve?

723
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:52,422
Oh, your watch must be fast.

724
00:24:53,082 --> 00:24:55,945
My wife probably set it ahead to get me home earlier.

725
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:57,053
Never works.

726
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,310
It’s eleven forty-nine.

727
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,404
Charmless, isn’t it?

728
00:25:02,491 --> 00:25:03,138
The room?

729
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:04,296
Needs plants.

730
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:05,279
I can get plants.

731
00:25:05,307 --> 00:25:07,535
Ever been to the Tribunals? Chicago?

732
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,045
No.

733
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,124
Cathedrals. Go if you ever get the chance.

734
00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:10,986
I will.

735
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:13,637
Going to get that?

736
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:15,226
Um, I’m not done here.

737
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:16,334
You’ve got ten minutes.

738
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,531
I’m going to stay here, catch up on e-mails

739
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,095
and make everyone really uncomfortable that I beat them here.

740
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:23,253
Sounds good.

741
00:25:25,768 --> 00:25:26,490
Hey you!

742
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,620
It’s a girl.

743
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:30,334
A girl? Oh good, we need a girl!

744
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,430
Why do we need a girl?

745
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:34,044
I don’t know. Aren’t there enough guys walking around out there?

746
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:35,637
Well, it’s a beautiful girl,

747
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:38,354
name to come, and Sookie’s fine, Jackson’s fine, everyone’s fine.

748
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,041
Good.

749
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:43,510
Fourteen hours of labor was the downside, but Sookie has the rest of her little girl’s life to get back at her for that.

750
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,156
I love the circle of life.

751
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:46,276
And there’s more good news.

752
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:46,961
What?

753
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:50,285
It was a false alarm. I’m not pregnant. The crisis has passed.

754
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,076
Oh, Mom. Good. I’m glad.

755
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:54,532
You’re glad? Huh.

756
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,773
As the sight of babies isn’t freaking me out anymore,

757
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:58,120
I can enjoy the maternity ward again.

758
00:25:58,158 --> 00:25:59,203
So what was with the apple?

759
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:04,028
I don’t know. But I just had a Moonpie and a Ding-Dong and washed it down with an Orange Crush in the cafeteria, so

760
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,483
no desire for anything nutritional.

761
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:07,834
Oh, thank God. I’m glad, Mom.

762
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,827
Yeah. So, listen.

763
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:11,670
How about we reschedule Sookie’s baby shower?

764
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:12,865
How? It’s too late.

765
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:17,240
No. We’ll throw a ‘Welcome to the Earth, Baby Girl Bellville’ party. Did you save the decorations?

766
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,086
Still in my car.

767
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,277
How about Saturday morning? That’s when she gets home.

768
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:22,654
Just come back with me tonight after dinner, we’ll set it up at her house.

769
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:23,416
Sounds good.

770
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,694
Hey, um,

771
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:29,366
did you ever mention this pregnancy scare to Luke?

772
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:32,215
My God, no. Can you imagine? ‘Uh, Luke, you’re going to be a daddy. ’

773
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,389
Suddenly there’s nothing left but a puff of smoke and a baseball cap spinning on the floor.

774
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:36,248
Yeah.

775
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,491
He never seemed much like a family guy.

776
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,836
This is for the best.

777
00:26:40,906 --> 00:26:41,529
Listen,

778
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:44,830
um, I’ve got to get back. We have a big staff meeting in a few minutes

779
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:46,735
and I want to get back and make sure everything’s set up and ready.

780
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,739
I’ll see you tonight, my one and only offspring.

781
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:49,339
Bye.

782
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:50,572
Bye.

783
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:54,980
Congratulations!

784
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:55,440
Thanks.

785
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,656
She’s sound asleep.

786
00:26:58,142 --> 00:26:59,947
I’m not so bright-eyed myself.

787
00:26:59,972 --> 00:27:02,162
Hey, before you go to sleep, we should probably decide on a name.

788
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,154
I know. Names are so hard.

789
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:07,430
But the good thing, whatever names we don’t use now, we just use on the next one.

790
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,646
Yeah. You know, we need to talk about that.

791
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:10,181
Sure.

792
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:12,584
I probably should have brought it up sooner, sorry.

793
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:13,789
No problem. What?

794
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,470
You’re getting a vasectomy.

795
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:16,764
What?

796
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,096
You’re getting a vasectomy.

797
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,020
You got me.

798
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:21,692
You’re funny.

799
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:22,501
Dark,

800
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:23,161
but funny.

801
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:25,202
I’m not joking, sweetie.

802
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,653
We’re cutting that tube. If it is a tube. I’m not really up on the procedure.

803
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:31,603
The doctor doing it will be, though, so I’m sure he’ll know.

804
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:32,403
You’re not kidding.

805
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,324
I’m not kidding.

806
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:34,432
Sookie, come on!

807
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,872
Jackson, we have one of each. We’ve kept the species going.

808
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,895
But I wanted four!

809
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,647
And I wanted three. This is a good compromise.

810
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:43,298
I’m sorry. Two is not a compromise between three and four.

811
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,923
This is Reggie, he’s going to take you down and have it done.

812
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,018
I’m having it done today?

813
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:47,528
Yep.

814
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:49,321
They sent the big nurse.

815
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:50,242
Just in case.

816
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:51,923
Hey!

817
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:55,224
You’ll get her back afterwards. Now, it’s just a quick outpatient procedure!

818
00:27:55,243 --> 00:27:57,895
You go in, lie down, close your eyes, snip snip, and you’re shooting blanks.

819
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:01,106
Is this all I’m having done today, or do I need to get some glute implants or something?

820
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:03,868
It’s everything, I promise. Kiss before you go.

821
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:07,266
just thought of the perfect name.

822
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:08,422
First name Martha,

823
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:09,318
middle name

824
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:13,040
Janice-Lori-Ethan-Rupert-Glenda-Carson-Daisy-Danny.

825
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,136
You got them all in.

826
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:15,804
Now go get cut.

827
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:26,624
Hi, Mom.

828
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:29,238
Lorelai, come in, come in. I want you to meet my special guest.

829
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:30,732
I’m curious to meet her.

830
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:34,267
Oh, boy.

831
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:35,934
She sure looked different in her picture.

832
00:28:35,972 --> 00:28:37,204
This is Mikhail.

833
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:39,457
Mikhail, my daughter Lorelai.

834
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:40,428
Hi.

835
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,287
Hello.

836
00:28:41,897 --> 00:28:42,743
What happened to Paola?

837
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:44,842
Oh, that annoying little stick? She drove me crazy.

838
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,564
You loved her.

839
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,994
There was something wrong with her.

840
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:48,724
So flighty, so skinny.

841
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:53,283
She made no noise when she walked, so you couldn’t hear her coming. I felt like I was being stalked by an elf.

842
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:53,694
Thank you.

843
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:58,237
She had the mentality of a preschooler. If she was sitting when she laughed, she would clap her feet together.

844
00:28:58,287 --> 00:28:59,308
Smoked like a fiend, too.

845
00:28:59,348 --> 00:28:59,933
Uh-huh.

846
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:03,015
And she kept playing with that obnoxious magic eight ball of yours.

847
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:06,267
She’d ask it the same question over and over until she got the answer she wanted.

848
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:11,919
I told her that’s not how it works. You’re supposed to accept the first answer it gives you and that’s that, but no. She kept going.

849
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:14,531
I wanted to stick the little twig in the garbage disposal.

850
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:16,074
So I exchanged her for Mikhail.

851
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:16,550
Really?

852
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,965
You can do that, just trade her in for another human being?

853
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:21,144
I paid for her, Lorelai, and she wasn’t what I wanted.

854
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,090
All right.

855
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:23,786
Isn’t he stunning?

856
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:25,466
He’s easy on the eyes, yes.

857
00:29:25,548 --> 00:29:27,055
You should see him stretch.

858
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:28,797
Do you want Luminista to take your bag?

859
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:31,013
No, I’m going to keep it with me. There’s something I want to show you.

860
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:31,573
Oh, good.

861
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:32,968
Shall we go in the living room?

862
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,591
He’s learning English, so keep your words short.

863
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,072
Living room!

864
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:38,267
Yes, please.

865
00:29:39,214 --> 00:29:40,135
What a value.

866
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:48,384
How interested are Stamford residents in a city forty miles away?

867
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:49,331
They’re interested.

868
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:52,032
That just takes resources away from covering local events.

869
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:55,118
That are less interesting than events taking place in New York City.

870
00:29:55,156 --> 00:29:58,143
If they’re that interesting, we should take a couple of our own calendar staffers.

871
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,897
Freelancers are a pain in the butt.

872
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:03,793
So, Franz Ferdinand comes to New York, forget freelancers, you’ll go cover it?

873
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:04,667
I didn’t say that.

874
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:05,489
Who’s he?

875
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:07,244
He’s a band.

876
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:08,028
Watch it, Pisher.

877
00:30:08,065 --> 00:30:09,186
Even I knew that, Sam.

878
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:10,605
Mitchum, please. Arbitrate.

879
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,534
And spoil the fun? No way.

880
00:30:12,632 --> 00:30:13,516
It’s your money.

881
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:14,474
Money well spent.

882
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:15,744
It’s not your money, Lucille.

883
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:17,424
Look, keep the system as is.

884
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,474
We don’t even have office space for extra people, let alone the budget.

885
00:30:21,095 --> 00:30:22,875
Go to Universities. Yale,

886
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:23,871
wherever.

887
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,223
Get volunteers to pick up what our staff can’t cover.

888
00:30:26,348 --> 00:30:27,362
Those kids jump at the chance.

889
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,213
I’ll pick up some slack.

890
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,956
After you pick up my dry cleaning, right?

891
00:30:30,018 --> 00:30:30,902
I’ll pick that up too.

892
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,657
Good, Harry, don’t let him push you around.

893
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,889
Are we going to end this marathon before we get to subscriptions?

894
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:36,972
Please say no.

895
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:38,302
Charlie’s feeling neglected again.

896
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:40,331
Where are we with our sales department, Charlie?

897
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:41,476
Abundant turnover.

898
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:42,609
We have to start paying more.

899
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:43,082
Oh!

900
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,302
That got the boss where it hurts.

901
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:46,517
Minimum wage plus twenty percent commission?

902
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,457
And all the stale pastry they can eat.

903
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:49,329
Up it to thirty.

904
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:51,084
Okay, now I’m in pain.

905
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:52,740
Crunch the numbers, Lloyd, and get them to me.

906
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:55,279
You never go behind the back of Captain Crunch!

907
00:30:55,307 --> 00:30:56,054
We should get together Monday.

908
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:58,307
Let’s all resume this Monday. Go home!

909
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,255
Meet your kids, feed your dogs!

910
00:31:01,853 --> 00:31:03,135
Have a good one.

911
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:07,193
That was fun.

912
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:08,251
Yeah.

913
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,969
that’s the way those things should go. Give and take.

914
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,588
The less I say, the better.

915
00:31:12,812 --> 00:31:13,820
Can I get you anything?

916
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,426
No, I’m about to take off, here.

917
00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:15,961
Okay.

918
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:19,534
So, I’m going to be pulling back here soon.

919
00:31:19,793 --> 00:31:20,602
From the paper?

920
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,747
I’ve done my damage. It’s time for them to take it and make something of it

921
00:31:24,785 --> 00:31:25,631
Oh. Okay.

922
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,315
I’ll probably be in Monday,

923
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:28,659
maybe Tuesday,

924
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:31,099
then not so much, after that.

925
00:31:31,246 --> 00:31:31,732
Well,

926
00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:34,346
I’m happy to keep going. Even without you here.

927
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,068
You know,

928
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:39,101
you and I haven’t really sat down and talked about the situation, about how you’re doing here, and all.

929
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:39,587
Well,

930
00:31:39,923 --> 00:31:40,769
you’ve been busy.

931
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:41,559
I’ve meant to.

932
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,887
Offered you the job, took you under my wing.

933
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,007
It’s part of the deal.

934
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:46,675
Great! I’d love your feedback.

935
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:48,107
Go on and sit.

936
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:56,553
I’ve worked with a lot of young people over the years. Interns, new hires.

937
00:31:57,026 --> 00:32:01,544
I’ve got a pretty good gut sense for people’s strengths and weaknesses.

938
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:04,654
Whether they have that certain something to make it in journalism.

939
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,936
It’s a tough business.

940
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:07,119
Lot of stress.

941
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:07,903
Definitely.

942
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:08,997
And I have to tell you.

943
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:12,532
You don’t got it.

944
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:17,511
Now, guts can be wrong. Mine’s been wrong before.

945
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:19,260
But not often.

946
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,019
I thought I was doing okay.

947
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:28,798
I just don’t really think that you have the drive to put yourself out there, to be honest.

948
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,652
To get a story. To dig.

949
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,914
I mean, just now in this meeting, I encouraged everyone to say whatever they wanted.

950
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:35,617
You said nothing.

951
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,447
I wasn’t sure if I should.

952
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:38,319
Exactly.

953
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:39,763
I mean, you saw Harry.

954
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,922
He jumped right into the fire. You didn’t.

955
00:32:41,938 --> 00:32:43,270
But Harry’s not an intern!

956
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:44,141
Doesn’t matter.

957
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:48,593
I’ve always done what’s asked of me.

958
00:32:48,643 --> 00:32:50,659
See, the thing is, in the real world,

959
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:54,372
it’s not always good enough to do just what’s asked of you.

960
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:56,762
But I thought I was in a really good rhythm with everyone here.

961
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:03,138
I’m not saying you’re not competent. You’re smart. You’re terrific at anticipating needs. Actually, you’d make a great assistant.

962
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,256
Oh.

963
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,451
I’m sorry.

964
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,091
It’s not my pleasure to disappoint someone like you.

965
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:09,061
Especially you.

966
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:12,844
What with the extenuating circumstances.

967
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:16,591
But it’s healthy. I don’t know any other way. I don’t B.S.

968
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:18,433
I should get back.

969
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:21,884
Hey, listen.

970
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:24,324
I know this is rough, but, uh,

971
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:26,854
I may have just done you a big favor.

972
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:29,592
Oh. Okay.

973
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:31,223
Thanks.

974
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:07,448
He had no contract. He had nothing in writing.

975
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:11,780
Granted, his offer matched the fair market value of the property but it was a rigged bid situation.

976
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,722
The house wasn’t even officially listed for sale.

977
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:15,514
It wasn’t a rigged bid, Kirk!

978
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,972
That’s for the courts to decide.

979
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:18,093
Get to the point, Kirk.

980
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,948
The house should be re-listed.

981
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:24,180
You should take the best offer from the person with the best chance of securing financing.

982
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:25,199
That person is me.

983
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:25,908
All right.

984
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,402
Luke, what do you have to say to that?

985
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:29,033
What the hell are we doing in a steam room?

986
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,409
Luke,

987
00:34:29,546 --> 00:34:32,770
I explained to you that if you wanted to see the town elders you had to do it on their terms.

988
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:34,799
This is ridiculous. I can’t think in here.

989
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,520
You should strip and get in a towel!

990
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:38,126
I’m not getting in a towel.

991
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:39,445
I think he’s got body issues.

992
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,494
I don’t have body issues. I just don’t agree with what’s going on. How it’s going on.

993
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:46,879
Town elders, I don’t think it’s appropriate for the defendant to address you in this tone, is it?

994
00:34:46,902 --> 00:34:48,894
I’m not the defending, Kirk. This isn’t a court.

995
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:51,147
It’s not even a room. It’s a box full of hot air.

996
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,081
Now he’s insulting you.

997
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:54,259
Listen. Old guys. I should get the house.

998
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:55,793
Watch your manners, young man!

999
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:56,802
I can get a loan -

1000
00:34:56,814 --> 00:34:58,407
But I have deep pockets!

1001
00:34:58,697 --> 00:34:59,680
Not now, I mean,

1002
00:34:59,705 --> 00:35:01,958
right now I’m naked, but my pants have pockets.

1003
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:05,518
Who are you guys, anyway? What gives you the authority to make town decisions?

1004
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:06,599
Luke, this isn’t helping.

1005
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,964
He’s a hothead with body issues and shallow pockets.

1006
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:09,960
This isn’t right.

1007
00:35:10,022 --> 00:35:11,466
Taylor and I had an agreement.

1008
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:13,471
He needs therapy and probably pills.

1009
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:15,602
Luke should get the house.

1010
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:16,536
What?

1011
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,042
It’s the right thing to do.

1012
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:21,754
Kirk may have a better claim technically, but Luke wants it more.

1013
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:22,065
But -

1014
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:24,695
I knew Luke’s father. His grandfather.

1015
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:25,653
We all did.

1016
00:35:25,728 --> 00:35:28,902
He’ll care for the house because he cares so much about it.

1017
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,994
He wants it for him and Lorelai.

1018
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:31,519
For me and -

1019
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:32,826
Did you -

1020
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:37,569
We all watched Luke pine for Lorelai for nine long years.

1021
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:40,853
He waited for her while she went through her many relationships.

1022
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:41,775
He won her.

1023
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:44,252
Now he wants this for her.

1024
00:35:44,304 --> 00:35:45,798
And for the others.

1025
00:35:45,873 --> 00:35:47,180
Others? What others?

1026
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:48,512
You’ll bring children into the house.

1027
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:50,379
I’ll bring children into the house, too!

1028
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:51,453
Maybe not my own.

1029
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:53,320
It’s right for Luke to have it.

1030
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:56,633
Kirk is young. There’ll be other places for him to go.

1031
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:58,052
That’s what I think.

1032
00:35:58,251 --> 00:35:59,222
Well I agree.

1033
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:01,002
Me too. Luke should get the house.

1034
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:01,876
Rip!

1035
00:36:02,013 --> 00:36:02,785
Thank you.

1036
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:04,515
Thank you, sir.

1037
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:07,892
Hey, Luke, it’s a big yard you’ll have there. A lot of lawn.

1038
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:10,543
I was wondering if we could talk about my rendering garden services?

1039
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,489
I have tools.

1040
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:12,595
Sarrusta.

1041
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,462
Sarrusta.

1042
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,520
Fantastic.

1043
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:18,271
And where is your town, Sarrusta?

1044
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:19,578
Just outside Moscow.

1045
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:21,195
It sounds wonderful.

1046
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:23,149
Our people die very young there.

1047
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:23,684
Oh.

1048
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,464
Well, that doesn’t sound so good.

1049
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:26,784
What’s in the bag?

1050
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:27,855
Hm?

1051
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,745
You’ve been clutching that bag all night. What’s in it?

1052
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:31,027
She’s got mystery bag.

1053
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:32,387
A mystery bag!

1054
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:33,395
Yes! What’s in the mystery bag?

1055
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:34,080
Oh.

1056
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,026
Well,

1057
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:37,378
um, this is my cover story.

1058
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,244
Your cover story? I thought it wasn’t coming out for two weeks. Let me see that.

1059
00:36:40,692 --> 00:36:41,315
Okay.

1060
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:46,518
Lorelai owns an inn, uh, what would you call it, maybe a dacha?

1061
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:47,699
Dacha? Yes.

1062
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:48,570
This is it.

1063
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:49,865
Ah, fantastic!

1064
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:50,462
Thank you.

1065
00:36:50,587 --> 00:36:51,943
Great dacha, this dacha!

1066
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,502
Are there other pictures with the article?

1067
00:36:53,552 --> 00:36:54,274
Uh-huh.

1068
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:55,295
Go ahead and read it.

1069
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:56,677
We have time before dinner, right?

1070
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:58,494
We can’t start dinner till Rory gets here.

1071
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,580
You’re going to love my granddaughter. You’ll just want to pick her up and throw her in the air.

1072
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:04,908
Give one to Mikhail, it’s how he’s learning English.

1073
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:06,454
Got plenty to go around.

1074
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,554
Oh, gorgeous!

1075
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,599
Yes.

1076
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:14,028
It’s a rave.

1077
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,273
We got lucky.

1078
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:26,805
I’ll be right back.

1079
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:28,099
Where are you going?

1080
00:37:28,174 --> 00:37:30,477
Uh, I’ll just, I’ll be right back. Sit, Mikhail.

1081
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,946
I mean, I didn’t mean that as a command.

1082
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,782
But please, have a seat. I’ll just, I’m going to -

1083
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:45,513
Oh, my God!

1084
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:47,927
Oh, my God!

1085
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:50,143
Lorelai!

1086
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,820
Lorelai! Are you in there?

1087
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:53,368
No!

1088
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:55,970
Come out of there.

1089
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:56,629
No.

1090
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,202
This is pathetic!

1091
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:01,386
I know.

1092
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,854
The things you say in this!

1093
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:03,813
I, I know.

1094
00:38:03,913 --> 00:38:05,332
Calling me Pol Pot!

1095
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:06,990
Mom, it was meant as a joke!

1096
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,733
The Pol Pot, the walking anthrax.

1097
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:10,525
I was just being edgy, like Chris Rock!

1098
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,982
Walking anthrax!

1099
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,192
You haven’t gotten to that part yet?

1100
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:13,889
No!

1101
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:15,956
Well, something to look forward to!

1102
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,308
I’m not going to continue talking about this through the door.

1103
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:21,406
Look, Mom, I was mad at you when I did the interview, okay? And

1104
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:22,489
I said things

1105
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:25,526
but I didn’t mean them, it just happened! And

1106
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:26,874
I’m not used to talking to reporters.

1107
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:29,064
I didn’t know about the whole ‘off the record, on the record’ thing.

1108
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,467
But I know now. And I’m really sorry it happened.

1109
00:38:31,515 --> 00:38:34,639
I did not force Jimmy Carter out of his room at that hotel.

1110
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,793
See, now that I thought was just an amusing anecdote.

1111
00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:39,843
I did not get into a, quote, bitch-fight with him.

1112
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:41,185
He’s an ex-president!

1113
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,426
It was with that insufferable Rosalyn.

1114
00:38:43,575 --> 00:38:46,861
Again, Mom, I am really, really sorry, and

1115
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:51,677
unless you forgive me, I, I am going to camp out in here possibly forever.

1116
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:54,239
Mom, I’m just -

1117
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:57,812
don’t tell your friends about the article, so they won’t read it, and the ones who do,

1118
00:38:57,824 --> 00:38:58,833
just tell them

1119
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:04,268
I was misquoted and I would recommend that you stop reading the article right now, and just

1120
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,313
look at the pictures.

1121
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:06,670
The pictures are really pretty.

1122
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:15,187
If you are applying explosives to the door, please tell me, so I can step away.

1123
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,063
I’ll stop reading.

1124
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,922
And we won’t talk about it again, ever?

1125
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:23,727
Fine. Come out.

1126
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:32,242
Let’s go back to the living room.

1127
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:34,374
Okay, Mom.

1128
00:39:34,946 --> 00:39:36,540
Goodbye, Mrs. Gilmore.

1129
00:39:36,602 --> 00:39:37,722
Mikhail, where are you going?

1130
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:38,594
I must leave!

1131
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:40,872
Leave? Why? Mikhail!

1132
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:44,457
Mikhail!

1133
00:39:54,715 --> 00:39:56,246
Hey! You’re here early!

1134
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:58,024
I guess.

1135
00:39:58,111 --> 00:39:59,518
Way early. Did you skip your dinner?

1136
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:01,659
Come down here, so I don’t have to yell.

1137
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:06,467
So there she is.

1138
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:06,990
Who?

1139
00:40:07,192 --> 00:40:09,258
The boat. Calling them ‘she’ is one of the most fun nautical traditions.

1140
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,337
Right. Something sexist in that, I’m sure.

1141
00:40:11,374 --> 00:40:12,271
I’m sure.

1142
00:40:15,594 --> 00:40:16,528
So how’d you get away?

1143
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,722
I don’t know, I just got away.

1144
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:19,655
I’m glad.

1145
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:21,161
So, who is she?

1146
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:21,796
Who?

1147
00:40:22,014 --> 00:40:23,022
The girl on the boat.

1148
00:40:23,146 --> 00:40:27,329
Okay, I’m sorry, we were just calling the boat a she. I’m a little bit behind but I’m catching up. She’s a friend of my sister’s.

1149
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:28,935
Well, I didn’t mean to interrupt anything.

1150
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,220
You weren’t interrupting anything.

1151
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:31,041
Looked like I was.

1152
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:32,012
I’ve known her forever.

1153
00:40:32,025 --> 00:40:33,494
Well, I didn’t mean to pull you away.

1154
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:36,072
We were just talking. Me, her, and her husband.

1155
00:40:36,122 --> 00:40:39,881
If you want, I can have them pull out pictures of their two-year-old. Ben has them in his jacket pocket.

1156
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:41,363
Do you even want me here?

1157
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,369
Ace, I invited you here.

1158
00:40:42,394 --> 00:40:44,547
Right. On Friday night, when you knew I couldn’t come.

1159
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:47,087
It’s my sister’s party. I didn’t pick the night.

1160
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,518
Traffic sucked getting here.

1161
00:40:48,543 --> 00:40:52,088
Sorry, but I can’t do anything about the traffic either. Can we just, um -

1162
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:56,244
What the hell is wrong with you?

1163
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:58,697
Nothing. I’m just in a weird mood.

1164
00:40:58,734 --> 00:40:59,456
I’ll say.

1165
00:40:59,555 --> 00:41:01,946
I’m sorry, I just - can we go somewhere else?

1166
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:02,493
What?

1167
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:03,485
Let’s go somewhere else.

1168
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,427
I don’t really feel like being around people.

1169
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:06,360
Okay, name it.

1170
00:41:06,629 --> 00:41:07,414
Will your sister mind?

1171
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:10,700
I’ve been here for an hour and a half, I’ve talked to everybody. My duty is done. Where do you want to go?

1172
00:41:10,872 --> 00:41:12,242
I don’t know. Somewhere.

1173
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,213
Far.

1174
00:41:14,258 --> 00:41:15,478
Out there.

1175
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,461
Where?

1176
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,818
Out to sea.

1177
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:18,814
Out to sea.

1178
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,536
Yeah.

1179
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:21,829
Let’s take that fancy-pants yacht of yours for a spin.

1180
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:24,904
Tricky, since it’s about to head out with all of my sister’s friends on it.

1181
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:25,662
Oh.

1182
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,043
Well, don’t you have another one?

1183
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:27,964
Not here.

1184
00:41:28,076 --> 00:41:28,873
Well, where’s the other one?

1185
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:29,670
Far away.

1186
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:31,388
Let’s just drive somewhere. Let’s go to New York.

1187
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:32,556
I don’t want to drive.

1188
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,348
I want to be out there, just the two of us.

1189
00:41:34,398 --> 00:41:34,946
Alone.

1190
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:35,469
Well -

1191
00:41:35,705 --> 00:41:38,593
You know the beginning of Moby Dick, when the narrator says that

1192
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:43,184
when he finds himself growing grim about the mouth and wanted to knock people’s hats off, he takes to the sea?

1193
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:43,720
Yeah.

1194
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:46,184
Well I feel like knocking people’s hats off.

1195
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,964
So I guess we got to take to the sea.

1196
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,037
That one looks good.

1197
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:52,867
Yeah.

1198
00:41:53,502 --> 00:41:54,685
Nice and seaworthy.

1199
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,353
Not ours to take.

1200
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:59,438
That ever stopped you before?

1201
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:02,961
I think I’ve been a bad influence on you, Ace.

1202
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:04,455
Let’s go, Huntzberger.

1203
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:05,251
Let’s go.

1204
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,370
See, I was mad at Mom -

1205
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:11,050
Mrs. Gilmore, here, at the time,

1206
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:17,296
and I ended up saying things I shouldn’t have said, because, you see, normally, I don’t make jokes about Joseph Stalin. They’re inappropriate.

1207
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:20,993
I just said it, and just to this writer, and she printed it.

1208
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:22,453
I mean, she’s not Joseph Stalin.

1209
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:25,961
And, not that there’s any excuse, but there is no way I could have known that

1210
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:29,086
a Russian man whose entire family and their village was killed by Stalin

1211
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:30,617
would be reading this in front of me,

1212
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,023
I mean, there’s just no way.

1213
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:34,164
She has this off-putting sense of humor, Mikhail.

1214
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,649
You’d know that if you spent time with her.

1215
00:42:35,673 --> 00:42:37,379
Yes, you would. You would know that.

1216
00:42:37,578 --> 00:42:38,138
Yes.

1217
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:39,918
I mean, Joseph Stalin was a monster.

1218
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:41,062
So, please, stay.

1219
00:42:42,057 --> 00:42:43,775
You just caught us on a bad day.

1220
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:44,833
All right.

1221
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:49,467
Um, this must be Rory.

1222
00:42:51,297 --> 00:42:52,405
Excuse me.

1223
00:42:52,952 --> 00:42:53,425
Hello?

1224
00:42:53,749 --> 00:42:54,309
Mom.

1225
00:42:54,357 --> 00:42:56,087
Hey, um, when are you getting here?

1226
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,506
I really, really want you here.

1227
00:42:57,818 --> 00:42:59,038
You need to come and get me.

1228
00:42:59,299 --> 00:42:59,959
Where are you?

1229
