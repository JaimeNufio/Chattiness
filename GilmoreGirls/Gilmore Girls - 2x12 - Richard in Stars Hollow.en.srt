1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:05,047
- Thanks. Is it cold out there!
- I know, it's freezing.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,924
Come on in. Sit by the fire.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,343
I'll make you both a drink
and then we can talk.

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,677
- About what?
- Antennas up.

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,346
Aye, aye, Captain.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,556
So, Lorelai, how are you?

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,517
I'm fine, Mom.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,894
- Rory?
- I'm fine, too, Grandma.

9
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,605
- How are you, Mom?
- Also fine.

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,650
Look at that, all three of us fine,
just like the Judds.

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,152
So, Lorelai, are you dating?

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,073
No, I'm not dating.

13
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,034
- Really? There's no one at all?
- No, I'm totally single.

14
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:37,329
- Any chance you'll get back with Max?
- No, Mom, there's no chance.

15
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,831
What about the man at the diner
who refuses to shave?

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,126
- Luke is just a friend.
- You think you'll be single your entire life?

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,169
Excuse me?

18
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,589
In terms of your finding someone,
what do you think the odds are?

19
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,299
Okay, what is going on?

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,427
I visited the family mausoleum today.

21
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,179
Never what you think it's gonna be.

22
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,516
I just wanted to check on things,
make sure they were keeping it up...

23
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,684
changing the flowers.

24
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,937
So I went inside and looked around,
and it occurred to me...

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,189
that there's a very limited space there.

26
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:08,443
Now, of course, there's a slot open
for me, Richard, you, and Rory.

27
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:12,197
But after the two of you, that's it.
No more room for anyone else.

28
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,490
Yes.

29
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,035
So if you actually do meet
someone someday...

30
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,537
I don't know where to put him.

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,540
Maybe we could just dump him
at the local pool hall.

32
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,418
- Don't be silly.
- 'Cause this is not a conversation for that.

33
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,587
We can't expand into the crypt next door...

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,214
because the family that owns it
won't even discuss it.

35
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,716
I'm getting a little creeped out.

36
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,970
So I talked to the head of the cemetery,
and he suggested that we buy an annex.

37
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,221
- An annex?
- Yes.

38
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,975
Like an outlet store. It would specialize
in the irregular family members.

39
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,896
If we do get the annex, and you do
eventually, someday, get married...

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,606
Just say 'fat chance,' will you?

41
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,317
I just meant
we'll have to decide who to move.

42
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,239
Why don't we move Aunt Cecile?
She was always annoying at parties.

43
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,241
- She loved the 'knock, knock' jokes.
- Mom!

44
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,493
- What?
- You can't just kick out Aunt Cecile.

45
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,289
'Knock, knock. ' 'Who's there?'
'Pineapple. ' 'Pineapple who?'

46
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,459
That's where it ended.
Never fully grasped its concept.

47
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,921
She was a complete idiot.
Okay, it's decided. Cecile goes.

48
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,839
Look, put me in the annex.

49
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,218
You are not leaving me alone
in there with Cecile.

50
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,469
I won't be held responsible...

51
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,430
for somebody being kicked out of
their eternal resting place.

52
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,224
I have an idea. I'll probably go first.

53
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,852
- Throw Rory in with me later.
- I'd like my own space, if you don't mind.

54
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,355
Why? It'd totally be fun
to be there together.

55
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,483
I plan to be buried with all the good CDs
and my 'rock star' belt.

56
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,276
Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

57
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,112
We were just discussing
who to move to the annex.

58
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,951
I vote for Cecile. Horrible woman.
And those terrible jokes.

59
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,037
- What did I tell you?
- This is a cold, cold family.

60
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,346
- This is really good.
- Yeah. What is it?

61
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,183
- No, don't tell us.
- Why not?

62
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,394
Every time I've had something great,
but didn't know what it was...

63
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,648
it turned out to be something disgusting
that I wouldn't have tried in the first place.

64
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,483
- Example?
- Snails.

65
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,652
- Gross.
- Eat in ignorance and enjoy.

66
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,695
Gladly.

67
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,449
- So, Dad, how's retired life treating you?
- Fascinating, actually.

68
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,743
I find myself noticing things.

69
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,038
Everyday things that I must have
witnessed a hundred times before...

70
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,664
and just walked right past.

71
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,335
Like yesterday, your mother
moved a vase, the one in the hall.

72
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,003
And she didn't do it in front of me.

73
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,714
No, 'cause nice girls never move vases
in front of men.

74
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,549
And she only moved it a little...

75
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,719
but as I passed it by,
I noticed it had been moved.

76
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,013
- Impressive.
- Every day's a new discovery.

77
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,640
Your mother changed her hair...

78
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,809
or she wore shoes
that didn't match her purse.

79
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,437
- Last Thursday.
- For heaven's sake.

80
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,105
- You know what else I noticed?
- What?

81
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,732
A first-edition Flaubert...

82
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,277
mint condition, shoved behind
several of my Churchill biographies.

83
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,654
- No.
- Interested?

84
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,906
- My life is good.
- Follow me.

85
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,451
See if you can find the new
Chanel patent leather pirate boots...

86
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,745
stuffed back behind your Churchills.

87
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,040
What's up, Mom?

88
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,376
- Nothing's up.
- You were twitching. I saw you.

89
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,585
You did not.

90
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,421
When Dad talked about the vase,
you pulled a full-on Tabitha.

91
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,298
- I did not.
- Is something wrong?

92
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,133
No, nothing's wrong.

93
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,261
Okay. Nothing's wrong.

94
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,098
It's just that things
are a little strange lately.

95
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,225
- What is?
- Having him home.

96
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,477
We've never really been home
at the same time.

97
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,564
We got married, went to Europe,
we came back, he went to work...

98
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,483
- and it's been that way ever since.
- So now it's different.

99
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,069
It's very different. He's always here...

100
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,447
watching me and noticing
when I move a vase, and...

101
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,534
I don't know. It's silly.

102
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,663
So he noticed my hair was different.
Women die for that sort of thing.

103
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,331
Mom, it's just an adjustment.

104
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,501
You guys just need to figure out
a new routine.

105
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,212
- I guess so.
- It'll just take some time.

106
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,755
Then you'll find your rhythm...

107
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,216
he'll go back to ignoring your hair.
All will be well.

108
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,635
- Yes, you're probably right.
- I am right.

109
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,929
Okay, I give. What is this?

110
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,139
Sweetbreads.

111
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,225
- Sweetbreads. So that's...
- Pancreas.

112
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,688
No!

113
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,444
- Paris.
- I'm not done.

114
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,820
- Sorry.
- No.

115
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,865
- Glad she finished that one.
- Why am I the only one who cares?

116
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,742
You're not the only one who cares.

117
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,286
I know you do,
but everyone in this room should care...

118
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,747
because I can't be the only one to care,
besides you.

119
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,082
It's just a contest.
It's not like you get a car...

120
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,252
- or a lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni.
- God, I love that stuff.

121
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,923
The Oppenheimer Award for Excellence
in school journalism is not a contest.

122
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,091
It's a statement. It says you're the best.

123
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,594
The best writers, best reporters,
best editors.

124
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,847
It says you've crushed all others
who have dared to take you on.

125
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,975
It says that every other school
in the United States of America...

126
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,394
is feeling nothing but shame,
defeat and pain...

127
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,231
because of the people
who won the Oppenheimer plaque.

128
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,234
I want to be those people.
I want to cause that pain.

129
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,860
- Our paper is good.
- Not good enough.

130
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,279
- Last week's issue...
- Was a fine effort by some kids.

131
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,282
- We are a bunch of kids.
- Not when we're in this room.

132
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:51,537
Lessure Prep Gazette, Broadmouth
Banner, Richmond Heights Chronicle...

133
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,039
these publications
are not our competition.

134
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,252
The New York Times, The Wall Street
Journal, The Washington Post...

135
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,796
these publications are our competition.

136
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,341
- Paris has gone bye-bye.
- We need to raise the bar.

137
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,510
We need to be better,
think harder, dig deeper.

138
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:10,222
I don't want to just submit a good issue,
but a great issue, the best issue.

139
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,932
- When's the deadline?
- Next week.

140
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,476
Okay, so then
we'd better get brainstorming.

141
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,520
- Does anyone have an idea for a theme?
- Yes.

142
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,230
- What?
- The one that wins.

143
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,940
Okay, good. Big help.

144
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,860
All right, everyone,
we should get working.

145
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,739
You're going to give yourself a stroke
one of these days, you know that?

146
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,243
Graciella, I'm leaving the shopping list
on the table here.

147
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,370
Remember, we need
the low-sudsing detergent.

148
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,664
I've drawn a picture
of what the box looks like...

149
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,417
so for heaven's sake,
pay attention this time.

150
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,461
How was your walk?

151
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,380
Carl Anderson needs a new roof.

152
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,674
- I'm gonna drop him a note.
- Good idea.

153
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,342
- Busy day?
- Very.

154
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,887
Is that the same cup of coffee
you had when I left?

155
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,639
When I left an hour ago,
you were having coffee.

156
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,266
No, this is a different cup.

157
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,435
So that's your third cup of coffee
this morning.

158
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,437
- I guess.
- Interesting.

159
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,440
I just realized you have
three cups of coffee in the morning.

160
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,025
Not every morning.

161
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,985
- Every morning this week.
- So what?

162
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,863
Nothing. Just an observation, that's all.

163
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,074
Lot of coffee to drink, early in the morning.

164
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,119
Any thoughts
on what you'd like for dinner tonight?

165
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,704
- No, anything's fine.
- All right.

166
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,123
- What are you writing down?
- Lamb chops.

167
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,209
- Is that for tonight?
- Yes.

168
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,588
- Do you not want lamb chops tonight?
- No, lamb chops is fine for tonight.

169
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,508
I just thought a nice roast
would also be nice for a change.

170
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,843
- Roast it is.
- Of course, if you want lamb chops...

171
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,304
- We're having roast.
- Okay, if that is what you want.

172
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,015
Do you want me to drop off
anything at the dry cleaner's?

173
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,308
- You're going there?
- Yes.

174
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,601
I'll go with you.

175
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,812
- I can bring in whatever you have.
- But it'd be nice to go together.

176
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,941
It would be romantic,
but I won't have time to get back here...

177
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,860
before my DAR meeting.
Probably better if I went alone.

178
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,737
You can come with me next week.

179
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,822
But I can go to the meeting with you.

180
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:54,076
To my meeting of the
Daughters of the American Revolution?

181
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,078
I think it'd be fascinating.

182
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,330
I go straight from there
to the symphony luncheon.

183
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,832
I'll tag along there, too.

184
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,750
But from there, I get my hair done.

185
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,253
You don't want to sit around
while I have my hair done.

186
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,963
- No, I don't.
- There you go.

187
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,506
You can cancel that.

188
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,133
I get my hair done
every Wednesday at 3:00.

189
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,802
Your hair looks fine.

190
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,221
Because I have my hair done
every Wednesday at 3:00.

191
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,389
What am I going to do?

192
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,850
- Why don't you go to the club?
- What?

193
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,184
Yes, the club.

194
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,688
You spend a fortune to belong there,
and you never got to go much before.

195
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,315
- Why don't you go there now?
- On a Wednesday afternoon?

196
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,733
I think it would be perfect.

197
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,111
I don't even know what they do
on a Wednesday.

198
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,821
No time like the present to find out.

199
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,699
- All right, I'll go to the club.
- Wonderful.

200
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:38,120
Going to the club
on a Wednesday afternoon.

201
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,082
Life certainly is
an interesting game of cards, isn't it?

202
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,584
It certainly is.

203
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,254
I'll see you tonight.

204
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,881
Have a good time.

205
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,594
Graciella, I need more coffee now.

206
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,179
How about a triple feature?

207
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,681
Three Days of the Condor,
The Show, and The Jerk.

208
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,601
- The Show is 9.5 hours.
- The Jerk is short.

209
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,978
The three faces of Costner: Bull Durham...

210
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,688
Dances with Wolves, The Postman.

211
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,357
Tom Petty playing Tom Petty,
that big speech about:

212
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,735
'Once upon a time,
there was a thing called mail. '

213
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,112
It'll make you laugh, cry,
or mail something.

214
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:15,157
Or we could do
a Ruth Gordon film festival.

215
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,368
Harold and Maude, Rosemary's Baby,
and that great episode of Taxi.

216
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,662
Got it. The worst film festival ever:

217
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,956
Cool as Ice, Hudson Hawk,
and Electric Boogaloo.

218
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,249
- Sold.
- I'll get the Hawk.

219
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,876
I'll get the Boogaloo.

220
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,589
- See? I told you.
- Wow!

221
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,342
- Guys, can I get in there?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,267
- Got it, plus four boxes of red vines.
- Let's go.

223
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,603
- Hi, Kirk.
- Evening, Lorelai.

224
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,940
I forgot my card at home,
but I think my number's 6247.

225
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,983
- You forgot your card?
- I might have lost it.

226
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,111
- Lost it? Was it temporary or laminated?
- Laminated.

227
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,406
- You lost a permanent card.
- You can just get me a new card.

228
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,034
I hope you understand
the gravity of the situation.

229
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,118
I'm trying to grasp it.

230
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,328
These cards are agreements.

231
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,789
It's an agreement
between you and the video store...

232
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:07,042
stating that you will take care
of your card, honor your card...

233
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,794
- you'll be nice to your card...
- Kirk.

234
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,337
- I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

235
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,383
Hello? Reception sucks here.
I'll be right back.

236
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,344
It'll be ready in a minute.

237
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,721
There were a couple of
little kids over there...

238
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,349
and they were looking at this tape
that's kind of mature.

239
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,643
You might want to put that stuff
on a higher shelf.

240
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,769
How mature?

241
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,689
It's a half-naked woman
just standing there.

242
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,524
- Is she a blonde?
- What?

243
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,192
I'll check it out right now.

244
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,111
Mom, I can hear you now. What's up?

245
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,988
- You have to take your father.
- What?

246
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,490
Tomorrow, for the whole day.
Just take him.

247
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,117
- Take him where?
- I don't care.

248
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,870
The zoo, the mall, Rhode Island.
Get him out of my house.

249
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:46,165
- What happened?
- He's joining my water aerobics class.

250
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,375
- What?
- He bought some new swim trunks.

251
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,543
He's out of control.

252
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,212
- Okay, Mom, calm down.
- I can't calm down.

253
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,841
I can't turn around without him being
there, following me, staring at me.

254
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,801
- He likes you.
- Don't be cute.

255
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,428
The man is driving me insane.

256
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,723
I am going to go insane.
If you don't help me, I'll take you with me.

257
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,683
Okay, I would like to help you...

258
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,185
- You owe me.
- What?

259
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,811
I pay for Rory's school.

260
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,230
- Are you serious?
- And I cosigned your loan.

261
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:13,025
- You have a house because of me.
- Are you hearing yourself?

262
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,361
I'm sorry, but I'm desperate.
I just need one day of peace.

263
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,488
And I will do anything to get it. Anything.

264
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,658
Okay. Mom, fine. I'll take him.

265
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,994
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.

266
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,537
Emily, where are you?

267
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:29,166
- I have to go. Tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning. Bye.

268
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,173
Oh, my God.
The most horrible thing happened.

269
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,967
Headmaster Charleston's office called.
He's been kidnapped.

270
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,428
Two guys broke in,
threw him in a Hefty bag...

271
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,305
used those twisty ties and carted him off.

272
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,432
Classes have been canceled
until further notice.

273
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:46,850
I'm going to school.

274
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:50,604
Rory, come on. It's just one day.
I'll write you a note.

275
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,106
'Dear Nazis,
Rory had to miss school today...

276
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,401
'to save her mom from spending
the entire day with her father...

277
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,403
'who looks at her
like she has three heads. '

278
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,571
Out of my way, please.

279
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,909
Do you know the last time my father
and I were alone for any period of time?

280
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,911
I was kicked out of summer camp...

281
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,163
for refusing to call
the camp counselor 'Peaches. '

282
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:12,209
I thought the entire concept of counselors
choosing summer-fruit names was stupid.

283
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,837
So they called my dad,
and he came to get me...

284
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,756
and it was just the two of us
alone in the car, from Maine...

285
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,133
with nothing to talk about
but my camp failure.

286
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:24,054
Luckily, I had also flashed the swim team,
or even that would have gotten stale.

287
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,014
I have The Franklin today. I cannot miss it.

288
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,432
Rory, please.

289
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,019
I can't handle the entire day with him.
I can't.

290
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,357
Mom, I promise.
Just make it till the afternoon...

291
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,360
and I promise I'll come home
and take grandpa off your hands.

292
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,445
- It'll be fine.
- It is not going to be fine.

293
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,822
It's going to be horrible.

294
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,533
It is going to be a bad,
depressing Lifetime movie...

295
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,077
and Nancy McKeon will be playing me.
I am Jo.

296
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,787
And that would be him.

297
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,831
It's not going to be that bad.

298
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,751
Be nice.

299
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,378
Very good.

300
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,630
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Grandpa.

301
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,174
Good morning, girls.

302
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,928
Did you have any trouble coming?

303
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,680
Not at all. The directions were fine.

304
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,641
- I'll see you this afternoon.
- I look forward to it.

305
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,935
Have fun.

306
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,655
- So, good drive?
- Very good.

307
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,034
Here.

308
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,043
- Would you like some coffee?
- I'm fine.

309
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,714
- Do you want coffee?
- Yes. God, yes. Thank you.

310
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,467
Sure you don't...

311
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,302
Coffee? No.

312
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,015
Can I offer you anything else?

313
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,644
Some Pop-Tarts, or...
That's pretty much it.

314
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,356
You don't have to entertain me, Lorelai.

315
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,484
I just came here to see you
and your house and your town.

316
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,736
You don't have to do
anything special for me.

317
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,905
- But you're my guest.
- No, I'm your father.

318
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,157
Just do whatever it is
you normally would do.

319
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,951
What I would normally do?

320
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,161
Yes, like for instance, this morning...

321
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,956
if I wasn't here, you would wake up...

322
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,417
obviously get some coffee, and then what?

323
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,796
I'd probably read the paper
for a little while...

324
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,047
and then have some breakfast.

325
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,384
- Let's read the paper, then.
- Okay. Let's read the paper.

326
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,891
- What sections would you like?
- You go first.

327
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,893
- I'll take what's left.
- Okay.

328
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:39,398
Normally, I read the Arts & Leisure
and the Lifestyles.

329
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,649
Perfect.

330
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,402
That leaves Business, Sports,
and World News.

331
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,115
- That worked out well.
- Yes, it did, didn't it?

332
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,037
Well, this is it. Luke's.

333
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:58,709
You know, when I was in college,
there was this horrible little diner...

334
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,627
across from my apartment building.

335
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,380
It was run by this terrible little couple.

336
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,257
They were very angry.

337
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,343
They would fight, break plates, curse.

338
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,972
And I went in there every morning
for three years...

339
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,058
and I had the most dreadful breakfasts.
Just awful.

340
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,768
I really miss that place.

341
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,771
- Morning.
- Luke, you remember my father.

342
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,732
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you.

343
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,067
- Quite a place you've got here.
- It pays the bills.

344
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,777
Always a plus in business.

345
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,363
- Dad, do you know what you want?
- I already ate.

346
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:29,740
You did? When?

347
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,451
I had breakfast at home.
I get up at 5:30 every morning.

348
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,494
Wow. Why?

349
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:36,246
I've gotten up at 5:30
for as long as I can remember.

350
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,791
That was when you had to work.
You can afford to get a little crazy.

351
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,836
- Get up at 5:45.
- Go ahead and order, Lorelai.

352
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,048
I'll have the banana pancakes,
side of bacon, and lots of coffee.

353
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,466
Coming right up.

354
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,094
- You didn't order any grapefruit.
- I don't like grapefruit.

355
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,639
I always start my breakfast
with half a grapefruit.

356
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,432
Do the Florida people know about you?

357
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,519
Anita Bryant left this huge gap
that has yet to be filled.

358
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,230
It's important
to start the day off correctly.

359
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,981
A grapefruit is brain food.

360
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:07,069
It has vitamin C and folic acid,
and it helps with your digestion.

361
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,822
- It really is a terrific fruit.
- I feel like you're about to break into song.

362
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,493
- I'm serious about this.
- But I still don't like grapefruit.

363
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,120
There are many things in life
that we don't like...

364
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,957
but their benefits far outweigh
the temporary discomforts...

365
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,584
- we have to endure.
- Hold on a sec.

366
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,589
- I need a grapefruit.
- What?

367
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:30,425
Before my pancakes this morning,
I need half a grapefruit...

368
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,386
preferably one that tastes like a doughnut.

369
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,221
- I don't have grapefruit.
- How come?

370
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,807
- I've never had grapefruit.
- I need a...

371
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,643
Listen. I have my father with me all day.

372
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,312
So far, there's been no major drama,
yelling, ugliness...

373
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:46,191
but there will be if I don't find a way
to get half a grapefruit for breakfast.

374
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,152
I could go next door to Doose's
and buy a grapefruit.

375
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,488
- I'd be eternally grateful.
- I'll be right back.

376
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,656
Thank you.

377
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:01,373
- Okay, the grapefruit is coming.
- You won't be sorry.

378
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,792
So, listen, I was thinking...

379
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,296
maybe after we're done here,
you might like to walk around town...

380
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,674
see the sights, and Rory usually
gets home around 4:00.

381
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,218
The two of you could hang out
until I get off work...

382
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,929
the three of us could meet for dinner.
How does that sound?

383
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,807
- Very sensible.
- I had to make up for my shoes.

384
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,144
- Is that your second cup of coffee?
- Third. Why?

385
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,312
No reason.

386
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:28,400
It's a lot of coffee,
first thing in the morning.

387
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,324
- You've got to stop doing that.
- I've been doing some research...

388
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,659
on the Oppenheimer Award
and noticed something.

389
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:41,288
The winning schools had an extremely
strong human-interest story on page 1.

390
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,166
That's what we need.
We've got the teen issues down...

391
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,085
a decent op-ed and political page,
but human interest?

392
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,921
- That's what we're missing.
- Ideas?

393
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,047
- Yes.
- Do tell.

394
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,674
According to the papers,
there's been a huge increase...

395
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,928
in the number of families fleeing
the major cities for small towns.

396
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,263
Hundreds of thousands
of city-slicking yuppies...

397
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,308
carting the trophy wife and asthmatic kids
off to small towns...

398
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,559
in search of the simple life.

399
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:06,730
- Milk a cow, pet a pig, find yourself.
- Interesting.

400
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,858
And I thought about it.
There's a romantic aspect to small towns.

401
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,110
White picket fences, low crime rate...

402
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:15,572
smaller classrooms, better tomatoes.
It all seems perfect.

403
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,824
But nothing is perfect. Nothing is safe.

404
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:21,286
Nothing is ever what it seems.
And then it hit me. Our story.

405
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,873
We're going to blow the lid off
the seedy underbelly of small-town life...

406
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:27,292
- starting with yours.
- Stars Hollow?

407
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:31,296
You're going to uncover
the seedy underbelly of Stars Hollow?

408
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,632
Stars Hollow doesn't have
a seedy underbelly.

409
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,175
We don't even have a meter maid.

410
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,636
You may be blind to it
because you live there...

411
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,264
but it's there and it's ugly,
and I'm going to find it.

412
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,641
- I'll meet you out front after school.
- Not today.

413
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,142
Why not? You hiding something?

414
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,395
I promised to help my mom
with something.

415
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,730
Help her tomorrow. We have work to do.

416
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,858
This could be our chance to nail this.

417
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:54,278
I have a hunch there's a good story here,
and I'm going to find it.

418
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,446
I was even going to share
a byline with you.

419
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,365
But if you want to bail out, that's fine.

420
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,950
Am I meeting you or not?

421
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,161
I don't think you're gonna find anything.

422
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:05,038
Then the worst that can happen
is I spend time in your town...

423
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,499
and have an urge
to enter a pie in the county fair.

424
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,960
I'll meet you out front. Don't be late.

425
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:16,175
As soon as I can,
I will send someone up. Yes, I will.

426
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:19,011
I understand.

427
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,312
I understand. Goodbye.

428
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,731
- What do you understand?
- I have no idea.

429
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,816
I tuned them out at the first screech.

430
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,819
- Have we heard from Manny yet?
- No, and I have paged him twice.

431
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,655
We only have enough linen
for one seating. Hand me the phone.

432
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,241
Plus, we are completely out
of clean towels.

433
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,705
Hi, Sophie, it's Lorelai.
I need to talk to Manny.

434
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,540
When will he be back?

435
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,835
Okay, I need him to call me really soon.
Like five minutes ago.

436
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,171
Okay. Thanks. We need a backup plan.

437
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:57,132
Call Patty's and see if she has
any party-rental tablecloths...

438
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,426
and then pull all the towels
from the pool...

439
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,887
and call Gandalfi's
and order a case of champagne.

440
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,139
Send a bottle to every room
that's towelless.

441
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,266
Page him every two minutes. No!

442
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,435
Hi, Dad. What are you doing?

443
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,730
- I thought you were gonna tour the town.
- I did.

444
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,900
I went into all the stores.
The cat one, twice.

445
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,819
And then I walked around a little,
and then I was done.

446
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,531
- What about the park? See the park?
- Yes, I saw the park.

447
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:23,700
What about the giant slinky?
We're mighty proud of that.

448
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,412
I saw the slinky, yes,
and the 100-year-old oak tree...

449
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,581
and the life-size yarn person.

450
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,585
I even stopped by your house and had
Babbette introduce me to all her gnomes.

451
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,755
And then I realized the only thing
I had not seen...

452
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,090
is my daughter at work.

453
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,676
Watching me at work
is not very interesting. Trust me.

454
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,427
You underestimate yourself.

455
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:45,222
Okay, there's books
on the shelves over there.

456
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,765
I have my newspaper. I'm fine.

457
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,725
All right, I'm just gonna...

458
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,978
- What's the matter?
- Is your jacket in the back?

459
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,772
- Your work jacket.
- I don't have a work jacket.

460
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,607
- That's your working outfit?
- Yeah.

461
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:56,733
And your boss doesn't mind?

462
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,570
Considering my boss is me,
no, she doesn't.

463
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,906
She did at first, but then I bought
her a cup of coffee, I realized...

464
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:06,034
all the hostility she was expressing
toward me was just jealousy.

465
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:09,079
We've been best friends ever since.
Take a seat, Dad.

466
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,833
Will you get me an extra bottle
of champagne...

467
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,627
- and smack me over the head with it?
- Absolutely.

468
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,004
Independence Inn.

469
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,298
Sit down, breathe,
remember you're at work...

470
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,342
- so screaming and crying is not an option.
- What are you doing?

471
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,720
- I can't meet you after school.
- What? You promised.

472
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:29,433
I have to work on a story for The Franklin.
I tried to get out of it, but couldn't.

473
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,893
- Great.
- I'm sorry.

474
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,687
No. School comes before
Mommy's mental health.

475
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,064
Tell Grandpa to wander around for a while.

476
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,941
- He already did.
- Did he see the slinky?

477
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:41,945
Yes, he saw the slinky. He's here now.
He hates my shirt.

478
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:44,239
Give him a book,
have Sookie make him lunch...

479
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:47,868
I swear I'll be home by dinner,
and you won't have to say a word.

480
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,957
- I think I got rabies.
- It's just a bus.

481
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,792
- It smelled.
- Like a bus.

482
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,544
I'll have to burn my clothes.

483
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,838
You have a car. We could have driven.

484
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,965
We have to get the feel
of the small-town world.

485
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,468
We won't get the feel of a small town
in a BMW.

486
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,971
- Is there something crawling in my hair?
- Where do you want to go?

487
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,557
I don't know.
Where's the bad part of town?

488
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,142
- Over there.
- What?

489
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:15,729
People. They're very upset
with the color of that fence.

490
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,981
This is the town, Paris.

491
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:21,026
It's not seedy, it's not run-down.
It's just Stars Hollow.

492
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,028
- Where's the local bar?
- In Woodbridge.

493
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,613
- Why aren't you helping?
- I'm trying.

494
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,615
You're looking for something
that's not here.

495
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,617
- What's this?
- Luke's Diner.

496
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,161
Diner? Okay, good.

497
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,546
What are you doing?

498
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,965
Trying just to blend in,
fade away, observe.

499
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,384
- Rory, coffee?
- Thanks, Luke.

500
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,970
- Who's your friend?
- Angela Lansbury.

501
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,472
- You're the owner here?
- Yes. Want some coffee?

502
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:53,350
- No, thanks. So, you run the diner?
- Oh, boy.

503
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:56,103
- You get a lot of truckers through here?
- Truckers?

504
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,064
Guys on the road for weeks,
lonely, looking for company...

505
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,190
a little pick-me-up?

506
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:02,901
- What's she talking about?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

507
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,529
It's common knowledge
that diners are breeding grounds...

508
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:07,573
- for prostitution and drug dealers.
- What?

509
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,324
Have you ever seen anything like that?

510
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,869
What about that guy over there?
What's his story?

511
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,203
Reverend Nichols?

512
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,455
Reverend Nichols?
Is that like Dr. Feelgood?

513
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,041
- How much do you like her?
- Do what you got to do.

514
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,502
Where did he come from?
What's up there?

515
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:23,547
Is that where you keep the girls?
You got a little cathouse?

516
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,549
I think she got you, Uncle Luke.
Give up now.

517
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:26,967
Do not add to this insanity.

518
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,846
An innocent boy like me should not
be raised in an atmosphere like this.

519
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,890
I want to be good.
Life's just not letting me.

520
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,725
- Get her out of here.
- Okay. Let's go.

521
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:37,227
Why do you need me to leave?
What have you got to hide?

522
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,979
Paris, let's go.

523
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,274
- We're aware of it.
- We're working on it.

524
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,360
As soon as the towels arrive,
your room will get the first one.

525
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,237
No one gets a towel before you do.

526
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,323
Did you get
the complimentary champagne?

527
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,617
Just open the champagne
and drink, relax, enjoy.

528
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,951
Of course it's free.

529
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:55,704
- We'll call you soon.
- Talk to you soon.

530
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,789
- I'm killing Manny.
- I'm helping.

531
00:24:57,873 --> 00:25:00,542
I'm gonna strangle him
with one of his own towels.

532
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,544
- Lorelai?
- Yeah, Dad?

533
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:05,172
You realize there are no tablecloths
in the dining room?

534
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,716
I do. We're having a problem
with our linen delivery.

535
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,468
It doesn't look very professional.

536
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,970
- It's Manny.
- I have to take this, Dad.

537
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:16,016
Manny, my mysterious man,
where have you been?

538
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,852
Me, Manny?
I'm just a desperate woman. Yes.

539
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:22,523
I know you have many problems,
but I have to have some towels or linens...

540
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:26,318
or I'm gonna be lying on the street,
talking about the inn I used to work at.

541
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,237
You don't want that, do you?

542
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,824
Anything you can do
to get me through the night.

543
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:36,829
Manny, I love you. You rock.
I am devoted to you.

544
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:40,082
I'm never gonna look at another towel
without thinking of you.

545
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,667
Thank you. Bye, stud.

546
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,128
- He'll be here in 20 minutes.
- Lorelai.

547
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:48,006
- Yes, Dad?
- May I speak to you for a moment?

548
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,300
Someone is in trouble.

549
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,637
Is something wrong, Dad?

550
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,431
Was that a business call
I just overheard there?

551
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,225
That was my linen delivery guy.

552
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,895
- So it was a business call?
- Yes, it was a business call.

553
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,939
And that's how you handle a business call?

554
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,024
I've known Manny for 10 years, Dad.

555
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:07,818
I don't care how long you've known him.

556
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,153
You never talk to a business associate
like that...

557
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,573
- especially not one that you employ.
- Okay, Dad.

558
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:15,325
- These people have to respect you.
- He does respect me.

559
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,660
You were flirting with him.

560
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:20,539
I said what I had to say in order to get
the linen before somebody else did...

561
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:23,167
- and I did, so I won.
- This isn't about winning.

562
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,045
This is about proper procedure.
You need to listen to me, Lorelai.

563
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,966
If there is one thing I know about,
it is the correct way to conduct yourself...

564
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,384
in a position of authority.

565
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:35,053
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

566
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,850
Because I'm only telling you this
for your own good.

567
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,562
All right. Go back to work.

568
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,315
I'll be right here if you need me.

569
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,609
Okey-dokey.

570
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,371
Nothing. Not even a cigarette butt
on the ground.

571
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,916
This town would make Frank Capra
want to throw up.

572
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:07,878
- Sorry, I tried to tell you.
- I know. It's just I was so sure.

573
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,922
We'll think of something else
to write about.

574
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:14,009
- We're not going to lose.
- There she is. The girl of the moment.

575
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:17,554
- You, young lady, are my hero.
- Why is that, Taylor?

576
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:18,972
Because in this day and age...

577
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:22,643
when the kids are willy-nilly
with their clothes, hair and morals...

578
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:27,022
it is heartwarming to see a sensible girl
like you still exists.

579
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:30,400
A girl who has the gumption and guts
to stand up and say:

580
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:33,904
'Why are we allowing this trash out
where all our children can see it?'

581
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,824
- And a few selected adults also.
- What are you talking about?

582
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:40,285
Come on in and see for yourself.

583
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,539
What happened? Where is everything?

584
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:45,958
Thanks to your brilliant suggestion...

585
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,795
they are all safely stashed
behind 'the Rory curtain. '

586
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,798
- The what?
- It seemed fitting to name it after you.

587
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:56,009
No. I don't want a Rory curtain.
I never asked for it.

588
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,887
You told me to put that movie
where the kids couldn't see it.

589
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,347
You did?

590
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,184
I just meant to put it on a higher shelf,
not to get fabric involved.

591
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:06,895
This is much better than a higher shelf.

592
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:09,314
Now all the movies
that we deem objectionable...

593
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:12,276
will be safely hidden
from the eyes of the children.

594
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:15,487
Plus, it'll make adults think twice
before they go back there.

595
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,489
No. I did not mean to do this.

596
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:18,907
What are you doing?

597
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,117
- This is it.
- What?

598
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,162
Our story.
Censorship in a small town. It's perfect.

599
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:25,372
You know I don't believe in censorship.

600
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,583
Even better.
'Small-town minds run amok. '

601
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,377
This is genius. It's gold.
We're going to win.

602
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,714
Taylor, on the record,
how long have you been working here?

603
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,009
Rory, we're home.

604
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,595
Next time, stop the car completely
before you get out.

605
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:42,139
- Rory, for the love of God, be home.
- I'm here.

606
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,683
Sorry. I was on the phone. How was your...

607
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:48,520
I don't think I've ever loved you
quite as much as I love you right now.

608
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,814
Ribs cracking. Organs crushing.

609
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,482
Yeah, well, love hurts.

610
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,446
- Lovely to see you, Rory.
- How was your day?

611
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:58,864
It was very pleasant.

612
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,408
- I heard you saw Mom in action.
- Yes, he did.

613
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:05,037
- She's great, isn't she?
- She's spirited.

614
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,955
- Spirited.
- Spirited is nice.

615
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,875
Let's talk dinner. How about Chinese?

616
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,753
- Very spirited food.
- Do you like Chinese food?

617
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,838
If prepared properly, I like it very much.

618
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:17,216
- I'll go call Al's.
- Al's?

619
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,259
Al's Pancake World.

620
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,929
I thought you said
we were having Chinese food.

621
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,097
Al's has the best Egg Foo Young
in Stars Hollow.

622
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,308
Is that saying anything?

623
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:30,145
Rory, come entertain your grandpa
while your spirited mommy orders, please.

624
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:33,357
Grandpa, do you want to see my room?

625
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,150
Yes, I would.

626
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,906
- $20 if you lock him in there.
- $30 if you chill.

627
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:44,243
- Interesting.
- What are you doing?

628
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,870
There are some holes
in your collection here...

629
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,081
and I'm just making a list to fill them.

630
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,375
These aren't all of my books.

631
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,254
My goodness.

632
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:57,214
And...

633
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:06,765
Possibly, I should concentrate on
acquiring you a bookcase first.

634
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:09,518
That's okay. I kind of like my system.

635
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,353
- Organized chaos?
- Exactly.

636
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,896
Very well. Carry on.

637
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:18,151
I'm glad not to see
any death rockers on your walls.

638
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,320
Where did you learn the term
'death rockers'?

639
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:23,782
I'm not entirely unfamiliar
with the music world in which you live.

640
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:26,410
I don't exactly live in the death-rock world.

641
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,453
If I do move there, I will send you a card.

642
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:29,955
I appreciate that.

643
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:32,958
- Harvard.
- Yeah.

644
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,294
We started the obsession board
a few years ago.

645
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:36,920
When we took that trip to Harvard...

646
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,464
the student store was having
a two-for-one flag sale...

647
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:42,426
so that sent us into the final stage
of the psychosis.

648
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,845
Hospitals were called,
medications were prescribed.

649
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:45,929
There is no cure.

650
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:48,140
Okay, I made the menu for the evening.

651
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:49,224
My God.

652
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,435
- Looks good.
- Who could eat all that food?

653
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:53,478
- I almost added the garlic chicken.
- Add it.

654
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,106
- There are only three of us.
- Yes, but we like choices.

655
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,941
Let's call. I'm starved.

656
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,489
Lorelai, you cannot order all that food.

657
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:06,325
You're teaching your daughter
wastefulness and gluttony.

658
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,951
Dad, we do this all the time.

659
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,245
We order way too much
and eat a third of it...

660
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:13,123
and eat leftovers for more than a week.
Finely honed system.

661
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:16,335
Now please just sit
and read something or watch TV.

662
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:25,010
I noticed all the Harvard paraphernalia
in Rory's room.

663
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,136
Yeah.

664
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,848
You might not want to get her settled
on one specific college quite so soon.

665
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,683
- Why not?
- She's young.

666
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:35,020
- She hasn't investigated her options.
- She wants to go to Harvard.

667
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,689
- Because she thinks you want her to.
- I do.

668
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:41,026
There are a lot of other good schools.
You know, I went to Yale.

669
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:44,154
- Yes, I do know.
- Yale is a very fine school.

670
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,365
Some might argue
a better school than Harvard.

671
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:49,368
- Some, meaning you?
- I just think Rory should explore it.

672
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,703
I can make some calls,
and set up an appointment.

673
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,955
- No.
- Why not?

674
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,415
- She wants to go to Harvard.
- That's ridiculous.

675
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,710
- Who's going to help her get into Harvard?
- Reese Witherspoon.

676
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,338
I am a Yale alumnus.
I give money to that school.

677
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,090
Getting her in will be a breeze.

678
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,092
We don't like breezes.
They mess up our hair.

679
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:08,136
- Do not be petulant.
- Do not pick a fight with me.

680
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,889
This is not about you. This is about Rory.

681
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:13,392
No, this is about Richard interfering.

682
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,394
Please, just let me handle this.

683
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,063
I know more about
the Ivy League system than you do.

684
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:21,567
- Is that the food already?
- No, sweets, I haven't ordered yet.

685
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,318
- Oh, my God.
- Who is it?

686
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,034
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

687
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,703
- Just standing here.
- Next to?

688
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:35,164
- A car. Your car.
- No.

689
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:36,874
- I finished it yesterday.
- You didn't.

690
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,458
Do you want them?

691
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,754
Now, if you don't like it,
I can sell it to someone else.

692
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:45,382
- Don't you dare.
- Dean, that's amazing.

693
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,926
- Can we drive? Does it drive?
- Does it drive?

694
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,138
I know it drives, but...
I can't believe you finished it.

695
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:52,222
You built me a car.

696
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,766
Now that the car is done,
will you build me a plane?

697
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,226
One that looks like Shamu?

698
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:58,478
- He made that car?
- Isn't that incredible?

699
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:00,772
- She can't accept it.
- Dad, it's okay.

700
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,482
It is not okay. He's a child.

701
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,943
She's not driving a car
a child put together.

702
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,279
Excuse me, sir,
but my father worked on cars...

703
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:10,199
and my grandfather worked on cars.
I know what I'm doing.

704
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:13,118
- A car is not a model airplane, young man.
- I know that.

705
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,329
- It is a complex vehicle.
- I know that, too.

706
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:18,499
I will not have my granddaughter
driving around in a contraption...

707
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:21,001
- you put together in auto shop.
- Can I say something?

708
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:25,547
I did not make this in auto shop.
I'm telling you, this car is safe.

709
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:27,716
- So you are a certified mechanic?
- No.

710
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,552
You had the assistance
of a certified mechanic?

711
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,971
Then you drove it past
a certified mechanic?

712
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:36,016
Dad, stop it.
This is a nice thing Dean did here.

713
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,810
- Remember, nice things?
- I'm sorry, she can't accept it.

714
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:42,147
Now, if you will excuse us,
we were about to order dinner.

715
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,983
I understand you want Rory to be safe,
but so do I.

716
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:47,903
I wouldn't give this car to her
if I didn't know for a fact...

717
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,947
that it was 100% safe.

718
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,742
I checked it, my father checked it,
and Gypsy at Hewes Brothers checked it.

719
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:55,035
It has been checked.

720
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,162
I'm supposed to take your word for it?

721
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,914
- No.
- Agreed.

722
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,582
- Let's go.
- Go where?

723
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,167
- To check it.
- I don't think so.

724
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:04,628
I have been working on this car
for months.

725
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,006
- I'm giving it to Rory.
- You're a very stubborn boy.

726
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,342
You want to drive? Or should I?

727
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,303
- I'll take my own car, thank you.
- Fine with me.

728
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,515
Drive behind me. I don't want it
blowing up in front of the Jag.

729
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,893
Try to keep your electrical system
working long enough to get there.

730
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:22,813
They worked the kinks
out of this electrical system years ago.

731
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:25,065
- I'll be right back.
- So will I.

732
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:34,283
I feel like one of us should have stood
between them waving a flag or something.

733
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,618
It looks fine to me.

734
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,829
- Check it again.
- I already checked it again.

735
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,748
I checked it earlier.
This was checking it again.

736
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,792
Go ahead, Gypsy, check it again.

737
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,377
- I've got all night.
- I don't.

738
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,337
- Check the transmission.
- It's all good.

739
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,630
- The carburetor.
- All good.

740
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,924
- Manifold pressure.
- Best pressure I've ever seen.

741
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,302
I insist you go over this entire car again.

742
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,262
There's nothing wrong with this car.

743
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:58,599
I am paying you for a service.
I would like that service performed.

744
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,392
Okay, I look again.

745
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,567
How many times
are you gonna make her do that?

746
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,402
As many times as it takes.

747
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,365
I know you think
I'm not good enough for Rory...

748
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:19,453
- but do you have to take it out on my car?
- She's my only granddaughter.

749
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,831
I have a responsibility to protect her.
She's young.

750
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:25,125
- She's naive.
- She's smart.

751
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:27,544
Yes, she's smart about certain things.

752
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:29,880
Look, I'm not about to do battle
with you here.

753
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:32,382
You can hate me, whatever. I don't care.

754
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,968
I hardly hate you. I don't even know you.

755
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,887
I'm right here. What do you want to know?

756
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:39,765
Besides what college I want to go to
or what I want to do...

757
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,767
because I still have no answers for you.

758
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,769
Those are not ridiculous questions to ask.

759
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,189
No, but you could have waited
until dessert to get to them.

760
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:51,485
- Yes, well, perhaps, the timing of the...
- Interrogation?

761
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:52,945
- Conversation.
- Conversation.

762
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:56,073
Perhaps the timing was a little off.

763
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:07,209
Your father. What does he do?

764
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:10,796
- Stereo systems.
- Installing them?

765
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:14,758
Selling them. He's got a shop
a couple of blocks from here.

766
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,218
And your mother?

767
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:19,429
She works part-time
transcribing medical records.

768
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:21,974
Interesting.

769
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,440
You like my granddaughter quite a bit.

770
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:33,610
No, I love your granddaughter quite a bit.

771
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:37,072
I was beginning to feel a little better
about this until you said that.

772
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:40,534
I'm not trying to make you feel better.
I'm trying to be honest.

773
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,077
Yes, you are.

774
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:45,664
- That's an admirable quality.
- Thank you.

775
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,333
Okay, I found something wrong.

776
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,918
- You did?
- What?

777
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:52,838
Windshield wipers came right off
in my hand. Very dangerous.

778
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,256
Thank God I checked again.

779
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,091
Gypsy, you broke those off yourself.

780
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:57,551
- Yes, I did.
- Put them back.

781
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,803
I can't look at this car anymore.

782
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:02,181
- I miss my home.
- Put them back.

783
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,395
- I suppose the car is safe.
- It is.

784
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:12,024
- I'm still not sure it's an appropriate gift.
- I understand that.

785
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:18,822
How tall are you?

786
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,617
Why? You want to dance?

787
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,660
No, thank you.

788
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:29,458
I appreciate the offer, though.

789
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,587
- How long are they going to be?
- I don't know.

790
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,674
He probably made Dean take the entire
thing apart and put it back together again.

791
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:38,800
Poor Dean.

792
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:42,638
He has to spend one evening with him.
I share chromosomes with the guy.

793
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,431
We had it thoroughly checked.

794
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:47,226
We found a little problem
with the windshield wipers.

795
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:51,063
Dean is there now, adjusting them.
But once that is taken care of...

796
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:54,274
I don't see any reason why,
with proper insurance, of course...

797
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:57,444
- why you can't have that car.
- Really? Thanks.

798
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:00,697
Hon, why don't you run
and pick up the food for us?

799
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:02,032
I've got this.

800
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:04,576
Hurry, before the Mu Shu congeals.

801
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,372
Why didn't you let me pay?

802
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:12,334
I didn't think it would be appropriate
under the circumstances.

803
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,545
What circumstances are those?

804
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:17,881
The ones where I'm about to get
really mad at you.

805
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:19,049
Excuse me?

806
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:23,762
This is my house and my town,
where I live my life.

807
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,430
Thank you for the geography lesson.

808
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,599
In the 32 years we've known each other...

809
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:31,103
have I once come to your work and
criticized the way you handle clients?

810
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,938
I don't remember you coming at all.

811
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,942
Have I passed judgment on your
breakfast habits or your clothing choices?

812
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,277
I was offering opinions.

813
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,697
I don't want your opinions,
especially not in front of my employees...

814
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,282
and not in front of my friends.

815
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,576
You can't take constructive criticism.

816
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:47,703
Nothing that came out
of your mouth today...

817
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:51,707
might in any universe, visited by Kirk
or Spock, be construed as constructive.

818
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,833
I beg to differ.

819
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:56,336
And this is the last time you come
into my house and overrule my word.

820
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,798
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Dean and the car.

821
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,426
- I was being...
- You have no right being anything.

822
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:05,012
Rory's my kid, and I make the rules.

823
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,471
If she comes home and says:

824
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:09,349
'I'm gonna spend the weekend
with Patricia KrenwinkeI'...

825
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:12,144
and I say, 'Okay, grab a sweater,'
you just have to deal.

826
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,395
Who's Patricia Krenwinkel?

827
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:16,732
If I tell her she can have the car
her boyfriend made for her...

828
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:19,359
- then she can.
- I didn't think it looked safe.

829
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:20,986
I have to think it looks safe.

830
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,988
Why can't I make you hear
what I'm saying?

831
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,698
I hear exactly what you're saying.

832
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,700
You came here as the judgment police.

833
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:29,453
You kept your uniform on,
and it comes off now.

834
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:31,413
- Lower your voice.
- I am a grown woman.

835
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:34,875
Treat me the way you treat people
who have invited you to their house...

836
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,835
- or you will not be invited again.
- Invited?

837
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,463
Don't you think
I know why you 'invited' me here?

838
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:42,090
- Because...
- Because your mother asked you to.

839
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:44,635
She called you up
and said I was driving her crazy.

840
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,304
Would you please take me
off her hands for one day...

841
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,598
so she could get some peace,
isn't that true?

842
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:53,477
You have never once invited me
to your house, Lorelai. Never.

843
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:56,939
I can hardly point to an event
that would prompt you to do so...

844
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,316
except my recent employment situation.

845
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,360
Okay, Dad, Mom did call me, but...

846
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,862
I never thought about retirement.

847
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:07,991
I never thought about what I would do
or what I would be once I wasn't working.

848
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,787
I never once imagined that I would go
from being a productive member...

849
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,288
of the human race...

850
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:17,167
to a decrepit old drone sitting at the club
at 3:00 in the afternoon...

851
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,336
drinking brandy and playing cards.

852
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:23,048
I am an annoyance to my wife
and a burden to my daughter.

853
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:28,053
Suddenly I realize
what it feels like to be obsolete.

854
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,683
I hope that you never have to learn
what that feels like.

855
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,726
Now, if you'll excuse me.

856
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:38,856
I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check
on dinner. I'm not very hungry.

857
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,870
- Nice picture.
- Gee, thanks.

858
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,580
You're very popular right now.

859
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:57,583
I bet if you burn a few books,
they'd probably make you mayor.

860
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,710
- This is ridiculous.
- I don't know.

861
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,378
You have a lot of supporters on this.

862
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:04,756
Pat Buchanan, Jerry Falwell,
Kathie Lee Gifford.

863
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,092
- Bye.
- Come on, it's a little funny.

864
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,218
No.

865
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:11,054
Being the poster girl for censorship
is not a little funny.

866
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:14,183
The only videos not behind that
curtain are Bambi and Dumbo.

867
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:15,517
They actually had a meeting...

868
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:17,811
about whether Babe
should be behind the curtain...

869
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,897
so as not to offend people
who keep kosher.

870
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,440
It's a crazy world we live in.

871
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,775
Where did they even find
that stupid picture?

872
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:26,236
The picture's good.
It's the people who are stupid.

873
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:29,406
- I'll never be able to leave my house.
- At least you won't starve.

874
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,241
I can't look at it anymore.

875
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:33,994
Relax. I don't think it'll be around
very long.

876
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:36,872
- Why?
- Just a guess.

877
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,502
- Enjoy the food.
- Come back here.

878
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,587
- Why?
- I'll give you an egg roll.

879
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,717
- Yes?
- What did you do?

880
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,011
Nothing much.
Just wanted to make sure...

881
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:53,430
whoever rented Dumbo or Bambi
gets a little surprise.

882
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:55,474
What kind of a surprise?

883
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:58,227
- What did you do?
- You owe me an egg roll.

884
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,790
Richard, there you are,
sneaking in like that.

885
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:22,000
- Hello, Emily.
- Nice to see you.

886
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:23,293
You seem very happy.

887
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:25,629
I had a very nice day.
Would you like a drink?

888
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:29,132
I saw Kiki Lennox today.
She's redoing her entire house.

889
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:32,302
I have to say, it's given me a few
ideas about this place.

890
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:35,472
I won't scare you with them tonight,
but I'm very excited about it.

891
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:36,640
I'm glad.

892
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:39,518
Then I did a little shopping
and had my nails done.

893
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,727
Very nice.

894
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:43,814
Sugar and Spice,
a little crazier than I usually wear...

895
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,567
but I don't know,
I was just in that kind of a mood.

896
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,902
So how was your day with the girls?

897
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,946
- Wonderful.
- Tell me about it.

898
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:53,740
Well, I saw the town, I saw Lorelai's work.

899
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:56,785
Did you eat? I can have Heloise
whip up something for you.

900
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:58,328
No, thanks. We had Chinese food.

901
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,664
- You love Chinese food.
- I do.

902
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:03,250
Well, I'm thrilled you had
such a wonderful time.

903
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:06,086
- It was good for you to get out like that.
- Yes, it was.

904
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,047
In fact, I'm still a little energized
from the day...

905
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:11,884
so I think I'm finally going to organize
all those stamps...

906
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:13,719
that I've been talking about for ages.

907
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,803
- Now?
- Why not?

908
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:18,182
I think that would be wonderful. Have fun.

909
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:23,288
English
