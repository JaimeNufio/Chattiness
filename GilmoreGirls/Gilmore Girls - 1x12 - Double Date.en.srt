1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,664
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

2
00:00:03,747 --> 00:00:05,873
- You're an amazing woman.
- Thanks for noticing.

3
00:00:05,916 --> 00:00:07,709
What exactly is going on
between you two?

4
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:10,710
- We're friends, that's it.
- You're idiots, the both of you.

5
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:13,338
I have to get to the bus stop.
Dean's meeting me there.

6
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:15,340
I'm trying to talk to you.

7
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:18,341
You sneaking around
buying somebody else's strawberries?

8
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:20,052
I needed the strawberries.

9
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:21,386
I get jealous sometimes.

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,055
I mean, you seem to have
this really great life going...

11
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,765
and I don't really fit in there.

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,225
Lane, I'm so sorry.

13
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:29,893
I've been the worst friend lately.

14
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:32,394
- A zucchini tush?
- Just a temporary name.

15
00:00:32,437 --> 00:00:35,272
You want me to serve
a genetically engineered vegetable...

16
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:36,523
named after a butt?

17
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:39,692
So once you're settled with Dean,
could you ask him about Todd?

18
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:40,818
Absolutely.

19
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:42,861
When did you become
the relationship expert?

20
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:45,863
You haven't been in a relationship
in years.

21
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:46,906
Wow.

22
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,491
I'm not gonna charge you for these.

23
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:51,784
I would rather starve myself
than know that my food was paid for...

24
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:54,161
by the lowered expectations
of the American public.

25
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:55,621
- Jackson?
- What?

26
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:58,999
Would you like to go
to dinner sometime with me?

27
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,500
Okay.

28
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:06,713
Mom!

29
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:10,352
Wow. You went new CD crazy.

30
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:12,478
They just had an amazing selection today.

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,606
The Best of Blondie, Kraftwerk,
Young Marble Giants...

32
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,607
Yoko Ono. Really?

33
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:21,527
A misunderstood artist.
The Beatles would've broken up anyway.

34
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,987
Have you shared your theory?

35
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:26,489
I know it, so do Yoko and Sean.
Julian's in denial, but what can you do?

36
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,533
I must listen
to anyone named Claudine Longet.

37
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,870
- Rory.
- Yes, Lane?

38
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:36,956
I have a favor to ask you.

39
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:39,249
- You know Dean?
- My boyfriend?

40
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,667
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

41
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:43,002
Remember I was telling you
about his friend, Todd?

42
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:44,044
Yes.

43
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:45,545
- Have you met him?
- No.

44
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:47,255
- He's cool.
- Good.

45
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,132
- Really cool.
- Good again.

46
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:51,341
- Really, really cool.
- Good still holds.

47
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:53,510
So cool that it brings me
to the next question.

48
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:55,928
- I'm studying in there.
- I know.

49
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:59,389
I have, like, 6,000 pages
of case studies to memorize...

50
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:03,309
and a big test on the Wal-Mart
phenomenon coming up on Friday.

51
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:08,271
Because I have a life and a job to
concentrate on besides business school...

52
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:10,022
I'm behind and I'll probably fail.

53
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:14,068
Then that 18-year-old annoying gnat
who sits behind me will get another 'A'...

54
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,487
and make that 'I'm smart, you're dumb'
face to me for the whole week...

55
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:20,531
and I'll be very upset and will possibly cry.

56
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,491
- The music's too loud.
- Yes.

57
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:24,326
- Got it.
- Thank you.

58
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:30,038
I was wondering if you could talk
to Dean about talking to Todd about me.

59
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:31,123
I guess.

60
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:34,000
And then maybe you could ask Dean
to ask him out.

61
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,251
For me.

62
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:38,212
Good, 'cause I don't think Dean
would wanna go out with Todd.

63
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:39,588
It'd screw up their friendship.

64
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:42,674
I was thinking this date
could maybe happen this weekend.

65
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,675
Sunday, preferably. After church.

66
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,677
- But don't mention church.
- Hold on a second.

67
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,885
Unless he's into church.

68
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,804
Now it's too quiet.

69
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,389
- I'll turn it up.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:54,558
So, what do you think?

71
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,727
- Who the hell is that anyway?
- Claudine Longet.

72
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:01,355
- The chick who shot the skier?
- Sure, why not?

73
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,148
Renaissance woman.

74
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:07,568
- You want me to set you up with Todd?
- Yes.

75
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,155
I was thinking that you and Dean could
come with us so it isn't that big of a deal.

76
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,239
You don't wanna do it.

77
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:15,783
- No. L...
- That's okay, I understand. No big deal.

78
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:18,827
Grandaddy, new album, used.
I love a bargain.

79
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,454
- I really don't know this Todd guy.
- I do.

80
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,956
- You've met him twice.
- But the third time's a charm.

81
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:25,999
- How do you know he's right for you?
- I know.

82
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,084
I'm telling you,
we're talking soul mate here.

83
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:29,919
The last time you met your soul mate...

84
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:33,255
you ran your fingers through his hair
and ended up hiding at my house.

85
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:37,008
I still have my key.
I made a mistake with Rich Bloomenfeld.

86
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:38,842
Everyone's allowed one mistake.

87
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:41,261
- But Todd is different.
- He is?

88
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:43,846
First, his name is Todd.
Different name, different guy.

89
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,264
Okay, so...

90
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:49,100
how important is this whole
business school thing anyway?

91
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:53,770
So what if I never run my own inn?
I like my job, my house, and my life.

92
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,814
I don't wanna be one of those people...

93
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:59,233
who's never satisfied with what they have,
you know.

94
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,153
I mean, some people don't have legs
or arms.

95
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,489
I have legs and arms.

96
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:09,033
What more could I possibly want
than legs and arms?

97
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:12,953
I could take all the classes in the world,
that's not gonna give me what I have.

98
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:14,829
- Legs and arms?
- Yes.

99
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:18,790
- Am I sounding completely crazy?
- Yes, you are.

100
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:20,958
- Wal-Mart is boring.
- Study.

101
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,087
- So?
- So?

102
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:27,922
- Rory.
- Okay.

103
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,466
- Really?
- Yes, Yoko.

104
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,306
So, what you doing?

105
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:53,359
Yes, Michel?

106
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,361
I apologize for any inconvenience...

107
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,237
I might be causing
your future employment.

108
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:59,739
But your current one
is experiencing a problem.

109
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,240
Once again I say, 'Yes, Michel?'

110
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:03,700
Are you sure you wouldn't like me to wait?

111
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:04,784
No, Michel.

112
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:08,287
Because learning the eating patterns
of the average Taco Bell consumer...

113
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:11,164
- is a vital lesson that...
- What do you want?

114
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:13,875
- We're overbooked.
- How are we overbooked?

115
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,837
There are more people here
than there are rooms to put them in.

116
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:19,337
I don't understand this.

117
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,007
I cannot describe it any simpler
than I already have.

118
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:23,383
Where did the Ruckers come from?

119
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:24,800
Judging from their clothing...

120
00:07:24,884 --> 00:07:27,427
a town where high rubber fishing boots
and spittoons...

121
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:29,637
would be considered formalwear.

122
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:31,764
Put them in the Jefferson Suite tonight.

123
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:33,599
Move them
to their booked room tomorrow.

124
00:07:33,683 --> 00:07:35,809
Offer dinner on the house
for the inconvenience.

125
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:37,185
Very well.

126
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:40,479
I'm gonna get some more coffee
if you need me.

127
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:45,108
I'll try and manage while you're gone.
Though, God knows, it won't be easy.

128
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,487
- Coffee?
- Yes.

129
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,655
Great.

130
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,407
- Meringue.
- Yeah.

131
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,284
I thought I'd do a variation
on a baked Alaska for dessert.

132
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,829
- What kind of variation?
- I hadn't thought of that yet.

133
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:03,664
- You could do them in the shape of Alaska.
- Interesting.

134
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:05,999
Or you could do
little baked Alaskas and Hawaiis.

135
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,459
- Because they joined the Union last.
- Exactly.

136
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,130
- Jackson.
- Sookie, hello.

137
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:14,339
- Hello.
- Hey.

138
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:18,550
- I brought you...
- Great. Just put them down there.

139
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:20,427
Right. Yes.

140
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:22,887
- How's that?
- That's great.

141
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,889
It's perfect. I really like them there.

142
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:28,725
- They do look good there, don't they?
- Yes, they do.

143
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,270
- Okay. I should...
- Squash.

144
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:34,980
- What?
- I need some.

145
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,606
- Squash?
- Pattypan.

146
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,191
- Okay, tomorrow.
- Same time?

147
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:40,359
- Lf that's good for you.
- It's perfect.

148
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:44,571
Okay. Then I'll see you tomorrow
with the pattypan.

149
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:45,780
Great.

150
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,242
Yes.

151
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:55,788
Okay, who walked in on who naked?

152
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:59,624
Oh, God, this is horrible.
He comes in and...

153
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,084
What's going on between you two?

154
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,127
I asked if he'd like
to have dinner sometime.

155
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,628
- I know, weeks ago.
- He said yes.

156
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:05,712
Which is good.

157
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,256
But since there was no definite plan
or date attached...

158
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,425
now the invitation is just out there
floating in the universe.

159
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,510
- Make a definite plan.
- I can't.

160
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,845
- Why?
- What if he says no?

161
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:16,888
He already said yes.

162
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:19,765
Yes to the amorphous, theoretical...

163
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:23,559
let's go out sometime and do something
not too specific proposition.

164
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:27,563
But dinner and a movie, it's concrete,
it's real. He might say no.

165
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,773
- I doubt he will.
- Why hasn't he asked me?

166
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:32,317
Maybe he thinks you changed your mind
since you asked.

167
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:35,486
- Why would he think that?
- Because you haven't mentioned it again.

168
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,197
- But I mentioned once. It's his turn.
- All right. Let's say it is his turn.

169
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:42,616
You can spend time sitting around,
waiting for him to realize that...

170
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,452
or you can run with the wolves
and make it your turn again.

171
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:49,330
- I don't want it to be my turn again.
- You just wanna let this opportunity pass?

172
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,123
- I wanna be the girl.
- You are.

173
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:53,542
That's why we're having
this confusing conversation.

174
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,543
- You think I should ask him out?
- On Sunday.

175
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,044
- Why Sunday?
- That's your day off.

176
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:58,295
- Okay.
- Now.

177
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,380
- What?
- Do it now before you lose your nerve.

178
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:03,257
- He isn't back to his office yet.
- Does he have a cell phone?

179
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:06,051
- Yes.
- People buy them for exactly this reason.

180
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:08,261
So you can get a hold of them
any time you want.

181
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:11,639
I thought they bought cell phones
if their cars broke down at night...

182
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:14,808
and they had to call someone for help
and there's psycho killers...

183
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:17,185
Call him, Sookie.

184
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:18,936
Call him.

185
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:25,650
- She knows his number by heart.
- He is my produce guy.

186
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:27,151
Very convenient excuse.

187
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,569
Jackson, it's Sookie.

188
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:31,655
I was wondering if you could call me back
when you get a chance.

189
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:32,823
Sooner rather than later.

190
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:35,407
It's not an emergency,
so don't freak out or anything.

191
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:38,661
The carrots still look good.
Seems like it's a shame to eat them...

192
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:40,828
sort of like you should put them in a vase...

193
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:43,372
- Hang up.
- Call me. Bye.

194
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,832
I got his voice mail.

195
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,335
Good. It gives you time to prepare
what you'll say...

196
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,503
maybe have suggestions ready
of places to go.

197
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:52,129
- Date prep time.
- Yes.

198
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:55,257
Okay, good. I'm good at that.
I'm good at prep.

199
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,677
- Spoon.
- Right.

200
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:21,443
- Is there anything in there about me?
- I don't know.

201
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:23,946
Your name wouldn't be lithium, would it?

202
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,613
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

203
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:27,823
We had a half day today.
Teacher conferences.

204
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:30,701
So I thought I'd come by and surprise you.

205
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:35,204
- You know how much I hate surprises.
- Yes, I'm very sorry.

206
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,543
- That's for surprising me.
- I have learned my lesson.

207
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,297
I have to talk to you about something.

208
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:51,426
I have to talk to you about something, too.
Come here.

209
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:58,222
- Okay, stop.
- Sorry.

210
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:00,725
- No, stay.
- Why?

211
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,268
Because I really need to talk to you
about something.

212
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:04,561
All right.

213
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:06,938
- It's about Todd.
- What about him?

214
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:09,022
- What do you think of him?
- He's my friend.

215
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:13,067
- I know.
- That would signify a positive impression.

216
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,986
Right. Okay, good.

217
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,987
- Yes. Can I kiss you now?
- I'm not done yet.

218
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,907
- Fine, go ahead.
- You know Lane.

219
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,076
- Yeah, I do.
- She likes Todd.

220
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,869
Okay.

221
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,997
And I think that they would really hit it off.

222
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,250
- You don't even know Todd.
- No, but you do.

223
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:35,293
- And you like him, you said so.
- I did.

224
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:37,378
Okay, then. There you go.

225
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:40,255
I would really like to kiss you now.

226
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:42,215
- Yes, so would I.
- Good. We agree.

227
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,966
I think we should set them up.

228
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,843
- Todd and Lane?
- Yeah.

229
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,388
We could all go out together,
to a movie or something.

230
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:52,098
On Sunday.

231
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,934
It would be really casual. No big deal.

232
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,395
- I just...
- What?

233
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,730
I'm just not sure that I see them together.

234
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,858
- You don't think Todd would like Lane?
- I'm not sure.

235
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:06,651
- Lane is great.
- I know.

236
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,402
- She's my best friend.
- I know that.

237
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,488
- Todd should be so lucky to get her.
- I didn't mean...

238
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:14,449
I can't believe you don't think
she's good or pretty enough.

239
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:17,118
I didn't say anything about
her not being pretty enough.

240
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,912
I don't know if he'll like her 'cause
I don't know what kind of girl he likes.

241
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:23,706
But if you wanna do this,
then I'll talk to him.

242
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,374
- You will?
- Yeah.

243
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,167
- And you'll mention Sunday?
- I'll mention Sunday.

244
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:30,336
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

245
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,339
So, was that it?

246
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,132
- Yeah, that was it.
- Then can we...

247
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,634
Kissing. Right, let's go.

248
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,769
- I give up.
- That's the spirit.

249
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,562
I can't remember any of this crap.

250
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,772
Not everyone is cut out
to be their own boss.

251
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:57,858
Maybe you are more of a worker bee.

252
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:00,485
A follower, a ticket ripper...

253
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:03,654
or the man at the concert
with the orange glow stick...

254
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:05,530
directing you where to park.

255
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:07,156
- You're baiting me, aren't you?
- No.

256
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,033
I seriously have no faith in your aptitude.

257
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:12,202
He called!

258
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,454
- And?
- I did what you said.

259
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,582
I had it worked out
and asked him if he'd like to go to dinner...

260
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:19,958
- at Chez Fleur on Sunday.
- Very nice.

261
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,794
- Thank you, and he said he'd love to.
- Great.

262
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,296
He said he would love to,
but his cousin's in town...

263
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,006
and is staying with him for the week.

264
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:28,799
Then just make it next week.

265
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:30,383
That would've been a good option...

266
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,385
had I thought of it
when I was on the phone.

267
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:35,804
- Instead I came up with another option.
- Which is?

268
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:38,556
That we double-date
with his cousin Rune and you.

269
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
What?

270
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:42,309
Okay, not as good as your option, I agree...

271
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:44,352
but it seemed pretty good at the time...

272
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:47,856
though I wasn't standing here
watching you make that face.

273
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:52,692
- No, I hate blind dates.
- I know, but this isn't a blind date.

274
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:57,237
This is you keeping his cousin company
while I have a date with Jackson.

275
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:58,655
Oh, God.

276
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:01,491
- Please? I'll be your best friend.
- You are my best friend.

277
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:03,659
- And you're mine.
- I know I am.

278
00:15:03,743 --> 00:15:05,911
So what are best friends for?

279
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:08,788
- Okay.
- Yes?

280
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,414
Yes, I'll go.

281
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:14,084
Thank you. You will not regret this.

282
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:16,711
- Pick another phrase.
- You will not have to pay.

283
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:18,212
Much better.

284
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,216
Shut up.

285
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:27,928
- Rory.
- What?

286
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,388
- Diva Glam.
- I've got it.

287
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,139
Bring it up. Hold still.

288
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:34,183
- Not too much.
- No, just enough to say, 'Hey, sailor. '

289
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,602
My stomach doesn't feel great.
I think I've the flu.

290
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,019
- I think you're nervous.
- Here.

291
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,229
- Thank you.
- I need the sparkly hair clips.

292
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,439
I'll find them in a minute.

293
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,650
- You look pretty.
- I do? Thank you.

294
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:47,276
- I should cancel.
- Let's do your lips first.

295
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,278
What if I'm making an idiot out of myself?

296
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,989
- By going out on a date?
- With my produce guy.

297
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:53,156
You like him.

298
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,575
But what if tonight is a disaster
and then he won't sell to me anymore?

299
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,618
- Oh, my God, you're right.
- Yes, see?

300
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:01,705
Since all the produce in the entire world
is in his possession...

301
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:04,957
and all the produce grown in the future
will be in his possession...

302
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,793
then we will never again get any produce,
and our vegetarian clients will die.

303
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:10,419
- I'm scared.
- I know.

304
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,255
- I like him.
- He likes you.

305
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:14,131
How do you know he's not being polite?

306
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:18,009
No, I mean it.
It's like I cornered him. He felt trapped.

307
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:20,261
- He had to say yes.
- He did not have to say yes.

308
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:22,763
Oh, my God! Technically, I'm his employer.

309
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:25,265
I am. I buy his wares.
His livelihood depends on me.

310
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:29,100
- I'm a sexual harasser.
- Then you need some false eyelashes.

311
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:32,187
This isn't funny. I am now desperate,
lonely, and a criminal.

312
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,271
Stop talking.

313
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:34,605
- But...
- No.

314
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:37,315
You have exhausted all your talking rights
by being crazy.

315
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,109
Sit down, and listen.

316
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:42,444
Tonight is a good thing.

317
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,738
Whether you find out
that you're madly in love...

318
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:47,574
or you're not meant for each other,
it's still a good thing.

319
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:48,658
I'll be right there.

320
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:52,036
And have I done a gorgeous job
on your face or what?

321
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,454
I'll be right back.

322
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,834
You're sure you don't mind?

323
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:03,294
- What's mine is yours.
- I owe you forever.

324
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:04,754
Good to know.

325
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:06,839
Which one do you think
Todd would like better?

326
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:09,299
- I don't know Todd.
- I think the rhinestones.

327
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:11,008
Rhinestones it is.

328
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:14,136
What did you tell your mom?

329
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,555
I told her I'd spend the evening here
with you guys.

330
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:17,639
What if she calls?

331
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:20,475
I mentioned we might go rent some videos
or go out to eat...

332
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:23,602
- which could explain any absence.
- Very thorough.

333
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,437
With my mom,
you leave nothing to chance.

334
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,814
Especially when
there is a non-Korean involved...

335
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:31,066
who, as far as I know,
has no medical aspirations.

336
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,026
- Sparkly clips.
- Thank you.

337
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,986
I like the rhinestones.

338
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:37,821
And for a touch of glamour.

339
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:42,074
- What are you gonna tell Lorelai?
- I don't know.

340
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:45,327
She wouldn't tell my mom, would she?

341
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,287
I don't know if she'd feel good
about lying to another mother.

342
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:50,165
It's like this weird code thing with her.

343
00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:53,959
- So we don't tell her?
- I'm not liking that option, either.

344
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:57,295
No. We'll tell her
that we're meeting Dean for a movie...

345
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,713
and then we go to the movie...

346
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:01,257
and then somebody
who happens to be Dean's friend...

347
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,008
just happens to be there
for the same movie.

348
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,844
So we figure that
it would be completely rude for us...

349
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,554
to not ask said person to come sit with us.

350
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,390
I say to hell with governor.
You run directly for president.

351
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:14,141
It's not that bad.

352
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:17,185
Let's just not think about it, okay?

353
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:19,687
- I really appreciate this.
- I know.

354
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:21,981
How do I look?

355
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:25,734
- You look too good for him.
- Just what I was going for.

356
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:30,362
- We're going.
- Where?

357
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:33,740
- We're going to a movie with Dean.
- Nothing dirty, violent, or French.

358
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:34,991
Are you gonna be home late?

359
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:38,786
There's a bit of doubt as to whether or not
we'll ever get out tonight.

360
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,371
Sookie, please!

361
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,080
Okay, I'm here.

362
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,623
I'm down.

363
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,294
- Where's your coat?
- It's upstairs.

364
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,338
- Aren't you gonna need it?
- It got caught around the thing...

365
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,216
and when I twisted around to get loose,
the choking started.

366
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:58,301
I'm free now.

367
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:00,845
- I'll get you something to wear.
- I'd appreciate that.

368
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:02,971
- Bye.
- Bye, kittens.

369
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:10,310
This is beautiful.

370
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:12,604
It goes with the theme of the evening.

371
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:16,065
- This is a nice thing you're doing for me.
- Any time.

372
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:17,483
Last looks.

373
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:22,570
I'll get it.

374
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:30,159
- Hi.
- Hi, Lorelai. Sorry we're late.

375
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:33,621
No problem.
Adds more primping time for the ladies.

376
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,080
- Hi, Jackson.
- Sookie.

377
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:38,207
- Hi.
- Hi.

378
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:44,545
Do you guys wanna come in for a minute?

379
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:45,754
Sure.

380
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:51,884
Lorelai, this is my cousin, Rune.
Rune, this is Lorelai.

381
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:54,261
Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

382
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,348
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- What's the matter?

383
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,683
I need a minute alone. Please?

384
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,601
Excuse us.

385
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:07,105
- What are you doing?
- That's Lorelai?

386
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:08,231
Yes.

387
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:11,525
- Did you see how tall she is?
- No, I haven't noticed actually.

388
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:13,819
How could you not?
She's like a basketball player.

389
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:16,112
Rune, she's a very nice lady.

390
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:18,655
I cannot go out with anyone that tall.

391
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,990
God, I can't believe
you set me up with that.

392
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:23,200
Was the bearded lady
busy tonight or something?

393
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:24,827
Just one night, a little dinner.

394
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:26,954
When she came to the door,
I didn't realize...

395
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:28,996
that that was who
I'd spend the evening with.

396
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:31,374
I thought it was her East German maid
or something.

397
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,335
- You're ridiculous. She's not that tall.
- She's tall enough.

398
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:36,544
Would you keep it down?
She's gonna hear you.

399
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:39,004
With those big ears, I bet she can.

400
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,590
Rune, you come into town
completely unannounced.

401
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:45,260
You eat all my food, crash on my couch,
and I don't say a thing.

402
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:47,844
The least you could do
is go out for one night.

403
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:50,180
Make some conversation. Be pleasant.

404
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:52,474
Who knows? Maybe you'll even enjoy it.

405
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:54,559
Why can't we go out, just the two of us?

406
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,476
Rune, please.

407
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:00,521
- Okay.
- Thank you.

408
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:08,361
- I think we should be going.
- Yes, that sounds good.

409
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,927
What size shoe do you wear?

410
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:43,097
- Size nine.
- Nine? Wow!

411
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:47,183
I wonder if the mussels are fresh.

412
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:50,644
It does say 'fresh mussels' on the menu.

413
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:53,480
A lot of times they say fresh
when they're frozen.

414
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,690
They're called fresh because they
were fresh when they were frozen.

415
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,026
Plus if they're not stored
with correct drainage...

416
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,278
they sit in their own excretion,
which is like sitting in your own...

417
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,530
I beg of you,
do not order the fresh mussels.

418
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,658
- But if they're fresh...
- Even if they're fresh.

419
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,579
I wonder where they get
their carrots from.

420
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:16,748
The carrot crop this year
has been really mealy.

421
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:22,586
- So, Rune.
- Yes?

422
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:26,088
- What is that? Rune?
- What do you mean?

423
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:28,924
I mean, where did Rune come from?

424
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,385
I'm from out of town.
I thought Jackson told you.

425
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:37,181
He did. I meant the name 'Rune. '
You don't meet a lot of Runes, right?

426
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:40,099
- It's my dad's name.
- Where'd he get it?

427
00:22:40,183 --> 00:22:42,226
I don't know. From his parents, I guess.

428
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,354
Okay, done with that topic.
The waiter, thank the Lord.

429
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:46,813
What can I get you?

430
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:49,857
- Are the mussels fresh?
- Yes, they are.

431
00:22:49,941 --> 00:22:52,442
Where exactly are your carrots from?

432
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:55,278
Is there anything on this menu
that isn't French?

433
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:58,072
I'll just have a martini,
and keep them coming.

434
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,907
Thanks.

435
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:13,084
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

436
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:14,710
They're fine.

437
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:18,588
I am not looking at them.
I'm looking at the world around me.

438
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,047
The world is fine, too.

439
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:22,341
- I wanna make sure they're having fun.
- They are.

440
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:23,592
How do you know?

441
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:26,761
They aren't in prison
or some sort of medieval torture chamber.

442
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:28,512
When you measure it that way.

443
00:23:28,596 --> 00:23:31,139
The amazing thing is
all these girls are screaming...

444
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,224
and none of them are getting the joke.

445
00:23:33,308 --> 00:23:36,935
He's playing the character of a rock star.
Beck is a genius...

446
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:39,062
and these stupid girls
are screaming at him...

447
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:41,522
just because they're buying into
the rock star image.

448
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:43,941
I love Beck. I understand Beck.

449
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,445
And the Foo Fighters. Gods.

450
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:52,698
Have you heard
the acoustic version of Everlong?

451
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,366
I can't even talk about it.

452
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:02,247
You know who I've really gotten
into lately? The Velvet Underground.

453
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:06,626
And Nico. She is amazing.
Depressing, German, scary chick.

454
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:09,670
I have the CD
if you wanna borrow it sometime.

455
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:12,964
What kind of music do you like?

456
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,341
I don't know. Whatever.

457
00:24:17,426 --> 00:24:19,135
- Fugazi?
- What?

458
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:20,970
The band on your shirt.

459
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:24,806
Cool picture.

460
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:28,767
- You don't know what's on your shirt?
- It's my sister's.

461
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:39,359
What about books? Do you like books?

462
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,403
Magazines?

463
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:46,740
What about school?
What are you majoring in?

464
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:49,450
I was thinking about gym.

465
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:55,789
If I major in gym, I only have to take
four classes my senior year.

466
00:24:57,582 --> 00:24:58,666
Cool.

467
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:03,045
Gym?

468
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,797
We work on our bikes together.
He's got the good tools.

469
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,882
Come on in. I have your tickets ready.

470
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:17,347
- It was so funny. Oh, God! You remember?
- I remember.

471
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,808
- What was Rory, eight?
- I believe she was.

472
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:23,018
Oh, God, that mud pie fiasco
haunted me for a year.

473
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:24,562
Hers looked just like mine.

474
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:27,855
Of course, I used homemade
chocolate cookies, bittersweet ganache...

475
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:31,566
and she used mud.
But they did look damn similar.

476
00:25:37,947 --> 00:25:41,032
So, Sookie has been experimenting...

477
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:44,952
with different forms of baking
for as long as I've known her.

478
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:48,121
- That's very interesting.
- Yeah.

479
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:51,833
Remember when I decided to teach you
how to make strawberry tarts...

480
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,043
and the entire kitchen was stained red...

481
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,213
and I had to repaint that one wall red
to make it look normal? Wasn't it?

482
00:25:58,588 --> 00:26:02,132
It was. Let's go powder our noses.

483
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:04,134
You'd need a lot of powder.

484
00:26:04,218 --> 00:26:07,262
- We'll be right back. Come on, hon.
- Okay.

485
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:14,934
Honey...

486
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:17,728
no matter how many beers
you buy me tonight...

487
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:19,354
I'm not the one going home with you.

488
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,606
- So concentrate on the one who might.
- What?

489
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,108
You haven't said a word
to Jackson all night.

490
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:25,609
- I haven't, have I?
- No.

491
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:28,903
- I know, I'm just so nervous.
- You're nervous?

492
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:31,322
You don't have a guy staring at you
like he's Cher...

493
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:32,573
and you're the kid from Mask.

494
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,074
I can't think of anything to say.

495
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:36,159
- To Jackson?
- Yes, to Jackson.

496
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:39,287
Yes, because to me, tonight,
there's been no off button.

497
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:40,955
I just...

498
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:43,915
This place is too fancy,
my hair is too tight...

499
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:46,083
and this dress is all wrong.

500
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:49,878
- And he looks really good, doesn't he?
- Yeah, he does.

501
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,296
I know I'm being crazy.

502
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,340
No, you're putting too much pressure
on this whole evening.

503
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:57,968
Look, in five seconds,
I could take your hair down...

504
00:26:58,052 --> 00:26:59,594
we could go someplace more casual...

505
00:26:59,678 --> 00:27:02,096
and personally,
I think you're wrong about the dress.

506
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,639
- Really?
- Yes.

507
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:08,226
Come on, let's go to Luke's.
Have burgers, talk, relax.

508
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:10,477
No pressure, no stress.

509
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,147
Unless I wind up stepping on Rune,
which might be fun.

510
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:16,274
- That would be great.
- Okay.

511
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:17,859
- Come on.
- All right.

512
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:32,036
Okay, what about movies?
You must have a favorite movie.

513
00:27:32,704 --> 00:27:35,414
- Yes, I do!
- Great. What is it?

514
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:36,790
Beethoven.

515
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:39,792
Beethoven? The one with the dog?

516
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:42,711
There's this scene
where this little dog is running around...

517
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,171
with a huge cabbage in its mouth.

518
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:49,508
Man, it's classic.
I shot my Dr. Pepper right out of my nose!

519
00:27:50,092 --> 00:27:51,301
I swear.

520
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:07,772
Welcome to Luke's.

521
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:10,399
- This is much better.
- It is, isn't it?

522
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:12,818
Grab a seat, I'll get the menus.

523
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,906
- Hey.
- Hey.

524
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,532
Four menus, one coffee,
and an anvil, please.

525
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,783
What's the anvil for?

526
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,493
- For Rune.
- What's a rune?

527
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,746
- Please, not that question again.
- Okay.

528
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,167
Here you go.

529
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:36,503
- Mind if I hang out here a sec?
- Why? What's going on over there?

530
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:38,797
Sookie and Jackson are on their first date.

531
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,882
- Seems to be going well.
- I think I'd wear blue to the wedding.

532
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:44,634
- Who's the other guy?
- Jackson's cousin. He's my date.

533
00:28:44,718 --> 00:28:46,928
- Lucky girl.
- Yes, I think so.

534
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:50,473
He is, believe it or not, even less thrilled
with the matchup than I am.

535
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:53,183
- You're kidding. Why?
- I'm too tall.

536
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:54,976
- Get out.
- I'm serious.

537
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,936
Doesn't he understand how great that is?

538
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,979
You can get all the stuff
from the top shelf.

539
00:28:59,063 --> 00:29:01,273
That is exactly what I bring
to a relationship.

540
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:03,566
Explain that to him, will you?

541
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:08,362
Luke, that is
an exceptionally good batch of coffee.

542
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:09,445
- Yeah?
- Hello!

543
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:10,738
I added a little nutmeg.

544
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:12,156
- Really?
- Yes.

545
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,075
That's very Richard Simmons of you.

546
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:18,828
What can I say?
Chicks dig a man with a feminine side.

547
00:29:20,913 --> 00:29:24,582
- Okay, I'm really bored.
- Sit down. We're about ready to order.

548
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:28,168
I don't wanna order.
I don't wanna eat here. I wanna go.

549
00:29:28,252 --> 00:29:29,919
- Rune.
- Jackson.

550
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:33,506
I came out with you tonight
under the impression that I'd have fun.

551
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,299
First I get stuck with her.

552
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:38,260
Then I get dragged to a French restaurant,
then out of it.

553
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:41,012
- God knows where I am now.
- You're at Luke's.

554
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:44,682
I've been very patient.

555
00:29:44,765 --> 00:29:46,891
Sunday night's almost over.
I wanna go bowling.

556
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:50,228
- Well, I...
- And I'd like you to go bowling with me.

557
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:52,396
Well...

558
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:56,107
I guess we should...

559
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,321
- Don't go!
- Really?

560
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,241
Yes. Stay here. We haven't really
even started our date yet.

561
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,743
No, we haven't.

562
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:14,497
Sorry, Rune. You're on your own tonight.

563
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:17,916
Fine! I'll just see you at home then.

564
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,336
- Maybe.
- Bye, loon.

565
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:29,257
Finally.

566
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:33,761
Guess you'll only need three menus now.

567
00:30:33,804 --> 00:30:36,722
Why don't you make up
three fabulous cheeseburgers...

568
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:38,807
and send two over there?
I'll have mine here.

569
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:42,268
First I gotta watch a man walk out
on you, then watch you eat alone?

570
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,519
Nope. Too pathetic.

571
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:45,854
- I'm not eating alone. You're here.
- I'm working.

572
00:30:45,938 --> 00:30:47,856
But after three cheeseburgers,
you're done...

573
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,234
- unless you're expecting Elijah to stop by.
- Okay, fine.

574
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:55,320
- Five card draw.
- You're on.

575
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:10,624
Give me four.

576
00:31:15,628 --> 00:31:16,795
No, four more.

577
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:19,464
You can't have four more,
those are the four I dealt you.

578
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:23,134
These don't help me, and I've vowed
to discard anything negative in my life.

579
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:26,761
- First Rune, and now these four cards.
- Whatever you say.

580
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,430
Much better. Thank you.

581
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,140
Rune knew when to run away.

582
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,271
- God, that's nice.
- Yep.

583
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,483
The whole first date
beginning of the relationship glow.

584
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,611
- Everything's new and exciting.
- Every joke is hilarious.

585
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:49,070
Every little touch is incredible.

586
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:51,614
- God, that's a good feeling.
- It is at that.

587
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:54,199
- I miss that.
- You'll have it again.

588
00:31:55,576 --> 00:31:56,826
I guess.

589
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:04,249
Maybe sometime we could...

590
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,419
- Where are the girls?
- What?

591
00:32:08,503 --> 00:32:10,838
- Lane said she's with you and Rory.
- Slow down.

592
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,090
I call, no answer.
I think they're at video store.

593
00:32:13,173 --> 00:32:15,925
I call again, no answer.
I call third time, no answer!

594
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:18,344
- You had a lot of free time.
- Where are the girls?

595
00:32:18,385 --> 00:32:20,469
- They said they're going to a movie.
- With who?

596
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:21,763
They were gonna meet Dean.

597
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:24,389
A boy? You let them go with a boy?

598
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:26,684
Mrs. Kim, Dean is Rory's boyfriend.

599
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:30,311
Because you let your daughter run around
with boys doesn't mean I let mine.

600
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:32,521
- I thought you knew.
- I didn't know!

601
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:37,191
They could be anywhere, doing anything.
Smoking or drinking or buying drugs!

602
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:39,318
They're at the movies.
There's no drugs there.

603
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:41,153
They don't even have the real Red Vines.

604
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:43,864
- I need to find them.
- I'm coming with.

605
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:56,582
- Good flick.
- Yeah, not bad.

606
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:58,082
Lane, what did you think?

607
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,710
I think it's late
and I should be getting home.

608
00:33:00,794 --> 00:33:02,920
- Really?
- Yeah, but it's been fun.

609
00:33:03,004 --> 00:33:05,922
No, come on. Let's go get
some ice cream or something.

610
00:33:06,006 --> 00:33:09,550
Eat it really fast,
get that freezy brain thing going. It's cool.

611
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:12,052
- So tempting, and yet...
- Lane Kim!

612
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:15,972
- My mom.
- My mom.

613
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:18,599
Two moms. That's gotta be bad.

614
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:19,975
I was just about to...

615
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:22,810
- Mom, I can...
- So not the time.

616
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:24,228
- You lied to me.
- Sorry.

617
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:25,813
Get home, right now!

618
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:28,731
- Rough family.
- What's going on?

619
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,692
Bits of information were left out
of the mom packets tonight.

620
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:32,735
I'm sorry.

621
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:36,029
Mother and daughter number two
are leaving now. Say bye, Rory.

622
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:38,948
- Bye.
- I'll call you later.

623
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:43,201
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Yeah. Bye, Dean.

624
00:33:44,244 --> 00:33:46,829
That's Rory's mom? She's a babe, man!

625
00:33:46,913 --> 00:33:49,081
- And what were you thinking?
- I know.

626
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:51,249
You lied to me.
What's that nonsense all about?

627
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,668
- I know I shouldn't have done that.
- Damn right, you shouldn't have.

628
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:57,921
But Lane wanted to go out with Todd.
She couldn't tell her mother.

629
00:33:57,963 --> 00:34:00,548
So I didn't tell you
so you wouldn't have to lie for us.

630
00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:02,716
You lied to me
so I wouldn't lie to Mrs. Kim?

631
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,801
- Yeah.
- My God. You really are my daughter.

632
00:34:04,885 --> 00:34:05,885
I'm sorry.

633
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,055
I have to know where you are,
especially when you have my shoes on.

634
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,139
I know.

635
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:12,433
This trust thing only works
if it goes both ways.

636
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:14,268
- I hated doing it.
- Good.

637
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,811
- Would you have?
- What?

638
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:19,313
- Lied for us?
- To Mrs. Kim?

639
00:34:19,397 --> 00:34:20,397
- Yeah.
- No.

640
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:22,524
- Why?
- Because that lady's scary.

641
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:25,776
I can't lie to another mother.
That's breaking the code.

642
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:28,153
So what were we supposed to do tonight?

643
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:30,989
I know Mrs. Kim
and Robert Duvall in The Great Santini...

644
00:34:31,073 --> 00:34:33,449
share a striking resemblance.
But she is Lane's mom.

645
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:35,951
She has the right to tell her
she can't do something.

646
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:38,870
You have to respect that
and I really have to respect that.

647
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:41,414
- So we were in a no-win situation tonight?
- Yep.

648
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:42,998
- Great.
- Sorry.

649
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,584
You know the one good thing
we learned from this?

650
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,544
- What?
- That I'm a babe.

651
00:35:09,978 --> 00:35:11,062
Hey.

652
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:14,314
- What's up, Rapunzel?
- Don't take it the wrong way...

653
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:17,108
but in all my fantasies
of who may appear at this window...

654
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:18,818
you never actually made the list.

655
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,028
So how are you?
I haven't heard from you in days.

656
00:35:21,112 --> 00:35:22,321
I'm okay, I guess.

657
00:35:22,404 --> 00:35:24,947
- I was afraid to call.
- I think that's best for now.

658
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,282
Your mom's really mad?

659
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,909
The words convent and Siberia
were used several times...

660
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,619
and at least once as a combo.

661
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:33,330
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

662
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:34,872
I shouldn't have arranged it.

663
00:35:34,956 --> 00:35:37,457
You arranged it because I asked,
and I'm glad you did.

664
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:38,500
You are?

665
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:41,586
If you hadn't set me up with Todd,
I'd still be in love with him.

666
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:42,878
Not the guy for you?

667
00:35:42,962 --> 00:35:47,340
Or for anybody who can read, write,
talk, or function on a basic human level.

668
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:48,507
I'm sorry.

669
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:50,343
I was so bored I couldn't see straight.

670
00:35:50,385 --> 00:35:53,470
I've been on Korean meditation weekends
that have had more laughs.

671
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:55,513
He liked you, though. Dean told me.

672
00:35:55,597 --> 00:35:57,223
- I know. He called.
- You're kidding.

673
00:35:57,307 --> 00:36:00,142
I pretended to be my mom
and wouldn't let me speak to him.

674
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:02,894
- Was that mean?
- I think he'll survive.

675
00:36:03,436 --> 00:36:05,854
He and Dean went muffler shopping today.

676
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,314
That's nice.

677
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,276
- How long before you can get out?
- I don't know.

678
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,569
I have to be in the house at all times,
except for school and church.

679
00:36:14,654 --> 00:36:17,364
- She didn't give you any time frame at all?
- Nope.

680
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:19,657
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

681
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:21,826
Is there anything I can do?

682
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:24,452
Yeah. Don't tell anyone
I went out with Todd, okay?

683
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:25,870
I promise.

684
00:36:26,163 --> 00:36:27,580
- I gotta go.
- Bye.

685
00:36:33,585 --> 00:36:34,752
You break, you buy.

686
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:37,880
- But it was sticking out in the aisle.
- You break, you buy!

687
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,547
I didn't put it in the aisle.

688
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,382
- You have eyes?
- Yes.

689
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,092
- These eyes work?
- Yes.

690
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:46,470
- They can make out shapes, sizes, colors?
- Yes, they can do all that...

691
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:49,513
Eyes work! They see lamp in aisle,
they send message to brain:

692
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:52,016
'Lamp in aisle, move. '
You move, you don't break lamp.

693
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:54,851
You have no eyes, not my problem,
it's between you and them.

694
00:36:54,935 --> 00:36:56,436
You break, you buy!

695
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:01,898
We appreciate your business.

696
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:06,527
- Hello.
- Hi.

697
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:10,238
I was wondering if I could maybe
talk to you for a minute.

698
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:11,739
- I'm working.
- Right.

699
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:14,700
This is gonna be so quick,
you'll be amazed.

700
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:16,285
Fine. Come.

701
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:27,877
Look, I am really sorry
about what happened the other night.

702
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,839
- Rory's never lied to me like that before.
- That you know of.

703
00:37:31,922 --> 00:37:35,966
No, I'm pretty sure that was the first time,
and it definitely was the last.

704
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,969
- Fine.
- I just didn't want you to feel...

705
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:42,472
like you couldn't send Lane
over to our house anymore.

706
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:44,849
Because you can, believe me.

707
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:48,101
Those girls go nowhere
without me knowing about it.

708
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:52,187
In fact, I was thinking of having
some house arrest ankle bracelets made.

709
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:56,524
Maybe cute ones
with a leopard print or zebra stripes.

710
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,150
Maybe a little glitter design.

711
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,653
Lane won't be coming over.
She'll stay in our house.

712
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:04,573
I was talking about later. She's not
gonna be grounded forever, is she?

713
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:07,283
Lane lied to me,
and she must be punished.

714
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:08,993
I totally agree.

715
00:38:09,493 --> 00:38:10,952
But she's a really good kid.

716
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:14,789
I don't think I've ever met a kid who
respects her parents more than Lane does.

717
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:17,041
Lying is not showing respect.

718
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:21,836
She's 16. She had a crush on a boy.

719
00:38:22,712 --> 00:38:25,630
Lane is not allowed to date boys
unless we have approved them.

720
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:29,259
She knows our rules. She broke them.
That is unacceptable.

721
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:31,302
Okay. Yes, you're right.

722
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:33,845
But teenagers sometimes slip up.

723
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:37,264
I don't care what teenagers do.
I care what Lane does.

724
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:41,185
It doesn't always work to lock a kid up
and throw away the key.

725
00:38:41,268 --> 00:38:44,061
I didn't throw away the key.
It's in the kitchen.

726
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:47,480
Okay. I was talking symbolically...

727
00:38:47,523 --> 00:38:49,941
but all right, I'm with you now.

728
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:54,779
When I was a teenager,
my parents tried to keep me locked up.

729
00:38:54,862 --> 00:38:57,739
They tried to force me
to become what they had in mind.

730
00:38:57,823 --> 00:39:02,576
I'm not talking exactly about Lane here,
but in my case, it really didn't work.

731
00:39:03,244 --> 00:39:05,745
You blame your parents
for getting pregnant?

732
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:09,498
No. I think if I'd had a little more space
or someone to listen to me...

733
00:39:09,582 --> 00:39:11,458
things might have turned out different.

734
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:12,918
I got lucky.

735
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:15,336
Because having Rory...

736
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,380
Totally the best thing
that could have happened.

737
00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:19,965
But let's be honest.

738
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:23,176
I certainly don't want Rory
to turn out like me.

739
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:26,261
I don't want Lane
to turn out like you either.

740
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:30,098
I believe that's the first thing
you and I have ever agreed on.

741
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:33,850
- I just want Lane to be safe.
- I just want Rory to be safe.

742
00:39:37,312 --> 00:39:38,979
I'm gonna go now.

743
00:39:40,523 --> 00:39:45,193
I think you are doing a great job with Lane.
She's a really great kid.

744
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:49,029
I just wanted to put my two cents in,
because that's what I do.

745
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:50,197
Bye.

746
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,581
I know, 'You break, you buy. '
I heard earlier.

747
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:04,916
That's $35, right?

748
00:40:06,293 --> 00:40:08,669
An 'A' minus. I am very impressed.

749
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:10,254
- Annoying boy in back of me...
- Yes?

750
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:11,380
...'B' plus.
- Loser.

751
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:13,423
I know. It's all very exciting.

752
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:17,134
Did I tell you Sookie and Jackson
have another date tonight?

753
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:19,428
- What is that, the third one this week?
- Yeah.

754
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:21,263
- That is so great.
- I know it is.

755
00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:24,598
But if she tells me the story
of how Jackson cultivates mealworms...

756
00:40:24,682 --> 00:40:27,809
to help fertilize his plants again
I'm gonna Romeo and Juliet them.

757
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:28,893
- It's sweet.
- Mealworms.

758
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:30,603
Gross, but sweet.

759
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:34,022
You know the rules:
No pages before French fries.

760
00:40:34,106 --> 00:40:35,690
- My God, it's Lane.
- You're kidding.

761
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:37,066
Give me your cell phone, quick.

762
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:38,985
- Where are you going?
- Outside.

763
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,361
- Why?
- Luke hates cell phones.

764
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:42,487
- So?
- I don't want to incur the wrath of Luke.

765
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:44,113
- Why not? It's fun.
- I'll be back.

766
00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:45,574
Goody-goody.

767
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,541
- Rory?
- Lane?

768
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:02,962
- I'm standing in the yard!
- Oh, my God! She let you out?

769
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:06,090
- I can go as far as the sign!
- That's so great!

770
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,969
- Hi.
- Hey.

771
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,180
I haven't seen you since the other night.
Everything okay?

772
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,389
Yeah, fine.

773
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:19,683
The dating world of 16-year-old girls.
Very exciting stuff.

774
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:20,892
I bet.

775
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:26,230
- Coffee?
- Do you have to ask?

776
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:31,193
I had a good time the other night
with the cards.

777
00:41:31,276 --> 00:41:32,526
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Good.

778
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:34,195
Yeah, in fact...

779
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:37,280
you rushed out of here before...

780
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:39,991
I had a chance to...

781
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:42,994
A chance to?

782
00:41:45,996 --> 00:41:47,872
Kick your ass in poker.

783
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:50,457
You wish.

784
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:53,960
- Burger?
- Two, and fries.

785
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,129
Maybe we could do it again sometime.

786
00:41:57,213 --> 00:42:00,006
Yeah, I would like that.

787
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:03,134
Here.

788
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:05,803
- Where are you going?
- Lane's allowed out for 15 minutes.

789
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:07,805
I'm gonna yell at her from
across the street.

790
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:09,555
- Still want your burger?
- I'll be back.

791
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,266
Yell hi for me!
