1
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,923
"Where's the ladies room?"

2
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:34,175
"More coffee, please."

3
00:00:34,276 --> 00:00:36,109
"Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"

4
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:38,929
We do not need to know how to say "Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"

5
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:40,416
- Oh, yes, we do. 
- Mom.

6
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,417
 When we're in Spain, we need to know how to say,

7
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:43,973
"Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"

8
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:46,103
When in France, "Does Johnny Depp live near here?"

9
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:47,993
When in Rome, "Does Gore Vidal live near here?"

10
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,383
You know, you look like me, yet my ways are completely lost on you.

11
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,121
Come on, honey, put that down. You've been studying all day.

12
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:55,801
I can't put it down, I've got finals coming up.

13
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:58,536
I know you have finals coming up, but you also have a piece of pie

14
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,419
sitting there that you've been completely ignoring.

15
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:01,762
Just let me get to the end of this chapter.

16
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:02,600
Oh, fine.

17
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,093
How important do you think it is to be able to say,

18
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,304
- "Help, I'm bleeding from the head"? 
- Just bring the phrase books.

19
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:10,275
No. If we learn all the phrases we need,

20
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:12,749
then the phrase books are one less thing we have to lug around.

21
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:15,411
We will never be able to learn all the phrases in every language

22
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:16,610
that we're going to need. Bring the books.

23
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:19,398
We can learn enough. Plus, doesn't everybody speak English over there anyway?

24
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:22,128
- Ugly American, party of one. 
- Fine, we'll bring the books.

25
00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:23,782
Okay, five minutes for pie.

26
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:25,128
 Finally.

27
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:26,782
They're here, I've got them.

28
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:27,962
You've got what?

29
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:30,495
- The brochures for my college. 
- You seem chipper.

30
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:33,080
I am. I have decided to make this whole

31
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:35,932
Seventh Day Adventist College experience a good one.

32
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:39,133
I'm gonna look on the bright side, find the silver lining, and make myself some lemonade.

33
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,149
- Good for you. 
- The campus looks pretty.

34
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:41,872
Very pretty.

35
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,913
It's got two huge parks with gardens and lakes.

36
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,508
- Two parks. 
- One for boys and one for girls.

37
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:51,569
And you know, I had originally thought that this was gonna be a suffocating place

38
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:53,657
with out of date rules and insane restrictions,

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,845
but boy was I wrong.

40
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:57,318
For example, curfew is up to 9:30.

41
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:59,478
9:45 if you're going for your Masters.

42
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,750
Makeup will be permitted, as long as it identically matches your skin tone.

43
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:07,088
And owning a Rolling Stones CD is no longer grounds for expulsion.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,838
You can work the demerits off in the campus clean-up crew.

45
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,936
There's a separate park for boys?

46
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:13,477
My life is over.

47
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,474
- Oh, no, I didn't say that. 
- You didn't have to.

48
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:19,114
- Well, it is over. 
- It's not over.

49
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,684
Every kid in that brochure was awkward and panicked.

50
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:24,490
It looked like the Academy Award audience during Michael Moore's speech.

51
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:26,881
Hey, why don't you add the phrase "Just sit there and look pretty"

52
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,992
to that list of yours there, okay? I've gotta go back to studying.

53
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:33,082
"Does that sexy guy in the Peugeot ad

54
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,920
who had a bit part in Armageddon live near here?"

55
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:15,548
- Oh, God, Rory, you scared me. 
- Sorry.

56
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,648
I've been sneaking around here like an idiot trying not to wake you up.

57
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,707
I've been up for hours.

58
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:22,691
Why? Did you have a bad dream?

59
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:25,665
The one where you finally meet Christiane Amanpour and she's really stupid?

60
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,973
No, I realized last night that at this rate,

61
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,582
I will never finish all the work I have to do.

62
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,854
- What work? 
- What work? What work, she asks.

63
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,346
Well, you know me and that dippy Christiane, takes a little while to catch up.

64
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,007
Here.

65
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:39,182
Things to do before graduation. A list, of course.

66
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:42,017
Study for finals, senior breakfast, senior awards,

67
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,769
finish final edition of the Franklin,

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,878
organize a new student government,

69
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,443
convince Paris to give up student gavel.

70
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,961
Oh, and I forgot - man the yearbook distribution table this afternoon

71
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,104
at the stupid Senior Palooza. Unbelievable.

72
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:57,430
I'll be manning the Booster Club Grad Night table at the same time,

73
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:59,488
so we can feel stupid and abused together.

74
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:01,669
I can't finish all this and sleep at the same time.

75
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,876
You have to sleep, it's what keeps you pretty.

76
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:05,821
Who cares if I'm pretty if I fail my finals?

77
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:08,336
Okay, you've got this so completely backwards.

78
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,086
What is all this?

79
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:13,426
I found that if I focus too much on one subject,

80
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:14,663
I start to get a little punchy.

81
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:17,608
This way, when I hit Bolshevik Revolution overload,

82
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:20,859
I just shift over here and, oh, hello, Anne Boleyn is going down,

83
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:23,422
and then when that gets too depressing, it's right over to calculus.

84
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,812
Saving the party subject for last?

85
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:28,375
This shifting back and forth seems to produce better results.

86
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,101
I think you're pushing yourself too hard.

87
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,233
I made out a schedule.

88
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:33,225
Every single moment of every single day

89
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:34,904
from now until graduation is accounted for.

90
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:36,999
You left off the Kiwanis Luncheon.

91
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,820
- I did? Are you sure? 
- It's on Monday.

92
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:42,047
How could I forget the Kiwanis Luncheon? They gave me their scholarship.

93
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:44,382
Oh, yes, a two hundred and fifty dollar scholarship.

94
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,112
That'll keep you in microwave popcorn for a week.

95
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:47,582
I'll just have to move something around.

96
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:48,980
And I'll have to work Grandma in.

97
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:50,148
Excuse me?

98
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:51,893
Grandma called and asked if I could come over

99
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,537
and help her pick out a dress to wear to my graduation.

100
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,893
- No. 
- I have to.

101
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,552
Rory, my mother's been dressing herself for years

102
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:59,571
and she has yet to show up at a function with her bra on the outside of her clothing.

103
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,935
She asked, I can't say no.

104
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:03,151
Tell her about the koala bears. She'll understand.

105
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:06,546
Please stop making fun of them. We need every cent we can get. Yale is expensive.

106
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,676
I know Yale is expensive.

107
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,447
We haven't heard from Yale financial aid yet.

108
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,477
We will, relax.

109
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:13,136
We had better hear from them soon

110
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:15,910
because I have a deposit to send in for my room

111
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:17,718
and I have a bunch of supplies to buy

112
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,816
and I wanna get all of that out of the way before we go to Europe,

113
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,032
otherwise I'll be obsessing about it the entire time.

114
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:25,947
Okay, listen, I'm gonna go out and get the paper.

115
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:29,330
Okay, don't show it to me because I have no time for recreational reading until June.

116
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:33,073
Could we move your, uh, chill session from four o'clock tomorrow afternoon

117
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:34,886
to... right now? That'd be great, thanks.

118
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,480
Okay, little tip -

119
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,563
the whole stalking thing works infinitely better

120
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:42,704
when you don't actually smash your face in the window.

121
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,455
- I need to talk to you. 
- Come inside.

122
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:45,760
No, Rory's in there.

123
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,616
Since when are you scared of Rory? 'Cause seriously, Luke, I think you can take her.

124
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,926
I just need to tell you something.

125
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,554
- Can she hear us? 
- Through the walls?

126
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:55,791
No, I put some kryptonite in her waffles. We're good.

127
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:56,592
Come over here.

128
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:59,046
You're freaking out the freaks this morning.

129
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:01,792
Jess is gone.

130
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,355
- What? 
- And I don't think he's coming back.

131
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:06,415
What do you mean gone? Like gone gone?

132
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:08,637
- Exactly like gone gone. 
- But when?

133
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,389
Last night, this morning, I don't know.

134
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:11,847
I went up there to get some money out of the safe

135
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,731
and I noticed that all of his stuff was gone.

136
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:15,728
Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry.

137
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,452
Yeah, well, forget it. I'm through with him.

138
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,244
He's eighteen, he can do whatever the hell he wants.

139
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,241
He's on his own, I'm through.

140
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:23,951
- Luke. 
- No, it's a relief.

141
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:26,742
That kid was driving me crazy. Let him make his own way from now on.

142
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:29,916
Let him see how far that smart mouth of his gets him without someone watching his back.

143
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,856
I couldn't be more relieved. I'm just worried about Rory.

144
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:35,492
- I assume she doesn't know. 
- She hasn't said anything.

145
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:38,824
- I can tell her if you want me to. 
- No, it's okay. I can do it.

146
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:42,355
I just have to figure out when. She's got a lot of things on her mind right now.

147
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:44,756
Don't wait too long. She'll notice eventually.

148
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:46,472
Yes, okay.

149
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,851
- Thanks for coming over. 
- No problem.

150
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:57,464
Luke?

151
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:05,338
- I failed him. 
- You did not fail him.

152
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:08,253
You supported him, you defended him, you gave him a chance,

153
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,827
and if he chose not to take it, there's nothing more you could do.

154
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:13,573
Yeah.

155
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:17,322
Well, I should go.

156
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,261
Do you have any idea where he went?

157
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,672
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.

158
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,278
Hey, there is no chill time scheduled for four o'clock tomorrow,

159
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,215
and the one thing I really don't have time for are your jokes, missy.

160
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:49,629
Later's good.

161
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,677
- Do you need some help, friend? 
- Nope.

162
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:36,662
Lived here 25 years. I can certainly point you in a direction, make your journey easier.

163
00:09:38,263 --> 00:09:39,676
Enjoy this beautiful day.

164
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,228
I'll have the alfalfa sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast.

165
00:10:58,435 --> 00:11:01,163
Yes, I've been holding for Mr. Hennings. I'm Lorelai Gilmore...

166
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,650
Oh, great, hi. Listen...

167
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,083
I just received this letter saying that my daughter did not qualify for financial aid.

168
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:10,891
Rory Gilmore...

169
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:18,725
Okay, yes, we did recently receive seventy-five thousand dollars,

170
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:21,556
but, here's the thing - that money is gone.

171
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:24,572
I gave it to my parents, so I don't have it anymore, I swear.

172
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:26,216
You could come over here and search me.

173
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:28,552
We could open a bottle of wine and put on some Motown and...

174
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:32,483
Yes, that was very inappropriate.

175
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:36,608
Look, I owed my parents that money

176
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,944
because they helped me put Rory through Chilton,

177
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:41,550
and I wanted her to go to Chilton so that she could get into...

178
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:44,874
Harvard, but then Harvard became Yale

179
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:48,226
- long story - and now that she's gotten into Yale, I paid them back for Chilton.

180
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:51,769
Just kind of a funny, wacky circle we could all laugh about someday...

181
00:11:54,003 --> 00:11:57,602
Yes, but, since I don't have the money anymore,

182
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,132
it just seems like it shouldn't count.

183
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:00,376
There must be something we can do.

184
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:03,649
I mean, Rory is the most deserving kid there is, just seriously.

185
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:05,262
You know, I don't know if you know the Kiwanis,

186
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:06,746
but they gave her their scholarship and...

187
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:13,420
I understand...

188
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:19,274
We'll just have to figure something out...

189
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,388
Thank you. Goodbye.

190
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:51,501
Hey! Hello, is anybody home? Hey!

191
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:52,720
Pipe down!

192
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,280
You selling something?

193
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,246
No. Does Jimmy Mariano live here?

194
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:57,379
Does he owe you money?

195
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:58,459
No, I'm his...

196
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:00,634
Jess. I'm Jess.

197
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:01,617
Jess?

198
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,970
- Jess Marian... 
- Frodo, back off now!

199
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:07,956
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

200
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,799
 I just wanna see Jimmy, okay?

201
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:12,652
Hey, did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?

202
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,417
Remember when they go to the Emerald City

203
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,701
and they ring the bell and the guy with the beard stuck his head out

204
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,311
and they said that they wanted to see the wizard, and he said no,

205
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,195
and they said, 'She's got the ruby slippers',

206
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:24,730
and he said 'Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in.'

207
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,018
Well, I'm the guy with the beard and I'm saying the no

208
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:29,850
unless you can come up with the ruby slippers.

209
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,604
- I'm his son. 
- His son?

210
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,031
Yes, his son.

211
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:39,024
Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in.

212
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,436
- Do they bite? 
- Just those two.

213
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,018
Which two? Hey, which two?

214
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:47,187
Great.

215
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,980
I swear I will bite you back.

216
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,379
- I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming. 
- Neither did I.

217
00:13:58,635 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm Sasha.

218
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:02,224
This is Angus, Chowder, Rufus, Legolas,

219
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,512
Caligula, Mudball, General Lee, Jimmy Jam,

220
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:07,148
Terry Lewis and Spot. Jimmy's not here right now.

221
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:10,073
Okay, I can just hang out, walk around for awhile.

222
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:11,327
Just tell me what time he gets home.

223
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:12,699
Why don't you come in? I'll call his work.

224
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:13,954
Oh, well...

225
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,936
- You have a lot of pets. 
- Ah, they're not all mine.

226
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:22,774
No?

227
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,732
No, some of 'em followed me home, some of 'em hang out,

228
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,116
some of 'em just needed a place to crash.

229
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,831
They drive Jimmy crazy, actually, but what can you do?

230
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:31,264
Someone's gotta take care of 'em, right?

231
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:34,924
I'm just gonna try and track him down, so just wander.

232
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,800
Lee, hi, I'm looking for Jimmy...

233
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:54,579
Okay, I'll hold...

234
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:10,626
Clowns, cats, dogs. I wonder where his tap shoes are.

235
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,302
He wasn't at work, but his guy said he'll be back any second.

236
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:49,650
Lil, Koko's gonna come over and stay with you while I'm gone, okay?

237
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:52,262
And put those books back in there when you're done, I mean it.

238
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,207
- Ready? 
- Yeah.

239
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:57,745
Hey... the door.

240
00:15:58,328 --> 00:15:59,015
Sorry.

241
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,939
- Shut up. 
- I swear.

242
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:09,818
Jean jackets are out? How is that possible?

243
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:11,764
 I just opened the magazine and there it was.

244
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,546
This is horrible. Who decides these things?

245
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,896
Marie Claire, apparently.

246
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:16,100
I feel so helpless.

247
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:18,814
Did you hear? Jean jackets are out.

248
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:19,982
- Out of where? 
- Vogue.

249
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,015
- No, Marie Claire. 
- Whatever. We still can't wear them.

250
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:25,301
You guys, thank you so much for passing out the yearbooks for me.

251
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:26,746
- I really need the study time. 
- No problem.

252
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,457
Do you want me to at least help you bring the boxes in?

253
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:30,433
Oh, we've got that taken care of.

254
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:31,661
Halfway through.

255
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:33,520
Yeah, hurry up, 'cause we need to get started.

256
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,412
God, he carries those boxes sexy.

257
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,471
Hello?

258
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,437
Rory, you haven't returned my calls.

259
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:43,247
Oh, Grandma, I'm so sorry. I've been really busy.

260
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,039
I don't care how busy you get, young lady,

261
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:46,651
you have to call your grandmother back.

262
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:48,771
- I'm sorry. 
- I won't be around forever, you know.

263
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,891
- I'm really sorry. 
- When are you coming over?

264
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,928
I need to discuss what to wear to your graduation. I thought about a suit.

265
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:56,243
- A suit seems nice. 
- But perhaps it's too formal.

266
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:57,159
Formal's fine.

267
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,665
What are your friends' families wearing?

268
00:16:58,823 --> 00:16:59,539
I don't know.

269
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,520
- Can you find out? 
- Sure, hold on.

270
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,571
Louise, what's your grandmother wearing to graduation?

271
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:08,145
Hopefully the pearls I get when she kicks.

272
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:12,573
- Why don't I just come over? 
- Oh, that would be wonderful. Today?

273
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,288
Yes, as soon as I can get away.

274
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,216
And bring a color swatch of your cap and gown so I don't clash.

275
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,113
Bye, Grandma.

276
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:21,456
Hello?

277
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,247
- I just got another call from Grandma. 
- Rory, no.

278
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,434
- I'm gonna go over there now. 
- And leave me here alone?

279
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:27,841
Where are you? I can't even see you.

280
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,443
I'm over here by the Old Spice ad.

281
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:31,087
- Hi. 
- Hi. Come over.

282
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,014
I have to go.

283
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,812
You can't come over and talk for one second?

284
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:36,555
The minute I walk into that room, I'm suddenly gonna have to sign yearbooks,

285
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,229
and since I'm severely crunched for time,

286
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,170
I'm gonna have to resort to classic clams like,

287
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:43,499
"Hey, have a good summer. Let's keep in touch. Best friends forever,"

288
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,870
and I do not wanna be that person.

289
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,891
Plus, Paris will immediately shanghai me and give me a million things to do.

290
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,830
You know what, you need to stop being intimidated by that girl.

291
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:52,279
You're going to college for God's sake.

292
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:55,796
You need to be able to stand up for yourself and say, you know, "Paris, go..."

293
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:57,635
What are you doing?

294
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:01,270
 I was just... the phone rang... your hair is really shiny.

295
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:03,865
We're not even set up yet. The box isn't out, the tickets aren't in order.

296
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:07,023
- Where's the list? 
- It's... in my purse.

297
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:09,750
Well, terrific. I can't think of a better place for the list to be except,

298
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:12,268
oh, maybe out here on the table where we could actually look at it.

299
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:14,608
Your hair is really shiny.

300
00:18:14,746 --> 00:18:16,476
I'm going to go make the rounds. I'll be back in a minute.

301
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:17,977
- Have you seen Rory? 
- No.

302
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,129
I'll go look outside.

303
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:21,402
Run, run, run!

304
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:23,505
Okay, I'm gonna be at Grandma's for about an hour. Can you pick me up?

305
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,979
If Paris hasn't had me flogged, then yes, I'll be there.

306
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:26,974
Thank you. Bye.

307
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:29,732
Please, God, tell me I didn't forget the list.

308
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,159
So the kid in the bookcase back there...

309
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:33,940
- Lily. 
- Is she yours?

310
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,076
Mine, yes. Not Jimmy's. 

311
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:38,666
I was married for the longest minute and a half in the world and...

312
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,649
- Hey sweetie, how's everything? 
- Everything's fine.

313
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:42,466
I love that. Give Riley a kiss.

314
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,424
Then I came to my senses and ran for the hills but I got Lily so I win, ha ha.

315
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:47,421
Short cut.

316
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:51,293
Anyhow, I met Jimmy about five and a half years ago,

317
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:53,095
but Lily's just crazy about him, so...

318
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:54,949
Ronnie, I found your keys again.

319
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:56,864
Oh, good. Thank you, baby doll.

320
00:18:56,987 --> 00:18:59,681
You have got to sew that hole in your pocket up, I mean it.

321
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,135
Today, drop your coat by my house.

322
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,885
I'll do it for you if you don't have the time.

323
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:05,466
- Got any brothers or sisters? 
- Apparently not.

324
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:10,028
Lily submitted a written request for a brother by the end of this year,

325
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,721
but I think I should be married before we have any kids.

326
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:13,884
You guys aren't married.

327
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,115
- You didn't know that. 
- No.

328
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,883
- You guys had quite a talk, didn't you? 
- Yeah, well.

329
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:23,596
Okay, we're here.

330
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:29,306
- Well. 
- It looks like a jar of pickles.

331
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:32,289
I know it's a jar of pickles, but is it that jar of pickles?

332
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:33,545
- Yes. 
- You're sure.

333
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:34,491
No.

334
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:37,886
Look, the Chicago dills were the original pickles they sold here back in 1922.

335
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,607
1922. Yes, I listen.

336
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:41,899
Now I finally tracked down the family that sold them,

337
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:44,809
I paid a substantial premium to use the original labels,

338
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,162
I waited weeks for them to arrive,

339
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,573
and now they're here and I look at them and they don't look the same.

340
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:49,757
Too many bumps.

341
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,549
Jimmy, I'm begging you, play golf.

342
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,288
Just call the guy and tell them they look different, please.

343
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:55,460
Whatever you say.

344
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:57,503
Jimmy.

345
00:19:57,938 --> 00:19:58,726
Hey Sash.

346
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,469
- You have a visitor. 
- Yeah?

347
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:09,453
- You... just get here? 
- Just got here.

348
00:20:12,408 --> 00:20:15,124
So, Jess, I assume you'll be staying for dinner?

349
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:18,055
- Oh, well... 
- Yeah, sure, stay.

350
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,472
You'll stay. He'll stay. We'll get Abbott's, right?

351
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:21,670
Whatever you want.

352
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:25,617
Well, I have to get back, so...

353
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,645
I will see you guys later.

354
00:20:33,948 --> 00:20:35,043
Sorry I didn't call.

355
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,092
Hey, life's about the spontaneous, right?

356
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:40,148
- This your place? 
- The Inferno... yes.

357
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:41,536
- It's nice. 
- Thanks.

358
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:46,521
Hey, why don't I come out there?

359
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:48,028
Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt your work.

360
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:50,214
No problem. Hey Lee, I'm gonna take a break for awhile.

361
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,334
Thank God.

362
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,208
- You didn't have to do that. 
- It's fine.

363
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,850
- So, first time on the West Coast? 
- First time on the West Coast.

364
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:08,943
The sites.

365
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,554
Ocean.

366
00:21:11,923 --> 00:21:13,473
- I wondered what that was. 
- Sand.

367
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:15,759
- Keeps the ocean in its place. 
- Sky.

368
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:17,376
We've got one of those back east.

369
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:19,645
And then you have the boardwalk.

370
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,634
Sunglasses, smoothies, bootlegged CD's.

371
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:24,850
- Good ones? 
- Not bad, I guess.

372
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:27,171
I never actually bought one. My neighbor Stan did.

373
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:29,817
He's not my neighbor anymore. He used to work at Lockheed,

374
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:33,289
but they shut down the Burbank plant, so he went to a trade school out in the valley.

375
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:34,789
He installs cable now.

376
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,997
Sends me a postcard at Christmas time.

377
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:38,783
He's Dutch.

378
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:44,000
Currently, we're in Santa Monica.

379
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:47,492
You keep walking, you hit Venice - that's technically where we live.

380
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,675
Past that, you got Marina Del Rey -

381
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:51,567
lotta bike shots in that area.

382
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:54,954
And then you're getting near the beaches - Manhattan, Redondo,

383
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,476
- and basically that's it. 
- That's it. That's all of LA.

384
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:01,354
There are these crazy rumors that if you get in your car

385
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,559
and you actually drive east away from the beach,

386
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:06,719
there's some city and other stuff, but personally I don't believe it.

387
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:08,132
I take it you like the beach.

388
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,148
I would marry the beach if man and property were allowed to mate.

389
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,141
Sounds serious.

390
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,359
I've lived a lot of places all over this country,

391
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:17,256
and nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to this.

392
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:19,980
So where else have you lived?

393
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:22,293
What, where else? Let's see.

394
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:24,912
Minneapolis, Chicago, Biloxi, Maine -

395
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,333
- worked on a lobster boat. 
- Yeah?

396
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,516
Yeah. Let me tell you, I smelled great.

397
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,578
- Did a stint in New Jersey, New Hampshire... 
- New York?

398
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:36,478
Oh, yeah, well, obviously, New York.

399
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,407
New York was...

400
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:39,974
well...

401
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:43,629
You know what New York was, so...

402
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:45,873
- Jimmy? 
- Yeah?

403
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,950
I didn't come here to bust your balls, man.

404
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:50,071
Okay, good to know.

405
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,520
Jimmy, I got the pickle guy. He's as worried about you as I am.

406
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:55,815
I should take this.

407
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:58,293
- Go ahead. I can just hang out. 
- You sure?

408
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,495
- I got my book, I'm good. 
- Okay, you're good.

409
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:16,116
Hi, I'm here to see my grandmother.

410
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:18,175
She's in the living room with Miss Celine.

411
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:19,946
- With who? 
- Right this way.

412
00:23:21,636 --> 00:23:23,484
- It's stunning. 
- Really?

413
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:25,322
Chills, I've got chills.

414
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:26,346
Turn for me, dear.

415
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,255
Oh, it moves, it just moves.

416
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:33,796
Ginger Rogers always insisted her dresses move just like that.

417
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:35,653
Ginger Rogers, well.

418
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:37,631
Of course, she didn't have your legs.

419
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,648
- Oh, Celine. 
- Hey, Grandma.

420
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:42,389
Rory, perfect. What do you think?

421
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:43,580
You look beautiful.

422
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:46,042
If I do, it's all because of this lady here.

423
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:47,882
Rory, I'd like you to meet Miss Celine.

424
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:50,283
She's been our fashion consultant for years.

425
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,714
- Oh, well, how do you... 
- Oh my God, it's Audrey Hepburn.

426
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:54,516
What?

427
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,877
You're Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina.

428
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,456
- Just a waif with eyes. 
- Thank you.

429
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:02,764
Celine, I don't think the handkerchief works with this.

430
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,338
Oh, Rory, I didn't know you were here.

431
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,574
Richard, look at this girl, what do you see?

432
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:09,542
- Well... 
- It's Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina.

433
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:12,189
Now that you mention it, there is a touch of Audrey in her.

434
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:13,561
But even prettier.

435
00:24:13,777 --> 00:24:16,491
Yes, without that ridiculous affected accent.

436
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:20,265
For years I kept telling her, "Audrey, get a speech therapist."

437
00:24:20,904 --> 00:24:22,086
She was very stubborn.

438
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,442
But could she wear capris.

439
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:27,099
You know, Rory is starting Yale in the fall.

440
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:29,690
Yale, that is exciting.

441
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:32,230
You'll need a whole new wardrobe, huh?

442
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:34,225
Oh, Celine, I love this one.

443
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:40,948
Yes, I had that exact suit made in mint for Mrs. Walter Cronkite just last week.

444
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,094
A darling woman.

445
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:45,516
We've been friends since the Big Bang.

446
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:46,750
That's nice.

447
00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:48,225
What do you think of this, Richard?

448
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:52,101
I like the green one with the beads. It made you look like a mermaid.

449
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,671
But you guys know that this is just a casual graduation.

450
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,058
Folding chairs on the grass.

451
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:59,105
- There's going to be grass? 
- Yeah, it's going to be outside.

452
00:24:59,345 --> 00:25:01,486
Oh, you cannot wear green around grass.

453
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:05,141
I learned that from Tova Borgnine the hard way.

454
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:08,914
Go try the red one on. Red goes wonderful with nature.

455
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:10,952
- All right. 
- I'm gonna try the grey linen.

456
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:15,556
- Ah, yes, with this white silk shirt. 
- Oh, very nice.

457
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:20,752
Yes, I had that exact shirt on Jimmy Stewart the night before his colonoscopy.

458
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:23,364
He came through it clean as a whistle.

459
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:31,192
Never underestimate the power of a good shirt.

460
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,378
I never will again.

461
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:37,771
- Kathy Kim. 
- Check.

462
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,989
Next.

463
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:41,990
Greg Agulara.

464
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:43,583
Check.

465
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:45,979
Next.

466
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:48,292
Brad Langford.

467
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,977
Check.

468
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:54,423
Why did you do that?

469
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:57,089
It has a really bad picture of us on it.

470
00:25:57,238 --> 00:25:59,343
Yeah, but that page had the only picture of me in the entire book.

471
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,714
There.

472
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:04,912
Next.

473
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:06,648
No one is going to buy our tickets.

474
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:08,503
Give it time, Paris.

475
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:10,959
We've been sitting here for an hour and have sold eight tickets.

476
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:13,237
Grad Night is a big deal, Paris.

477
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:14,595
They will buy the tickets.

478
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:16,935
Unbutton your top.

479
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:18,374
What?

480
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:20,560
Teenage boys are controlled by one thing. Unbutton your top.

481
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:23,320
Well, me doing it isn't going to help any.

482
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,142
Paris, you need to relax.

483
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:27,282
You need to stop worrying. You need to stop obsessing.

484
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,874
You need to stop looking at my boobs.

485
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:32,723
Fine. Oh, man, even the stupid class poster table has a line.

486
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,032
Okay, time to play "Let's distract Paris." Look at me.

487
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,546
- Let's talk. 
- About what?

488
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:40,275
Anything. Tell me what college you finally landed on.

489
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:41,944
- I didn't. 
- What's it between?

490
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:45,565
- Princeton, Columbia, and Yale. 
- Good choices.

491
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,551
I'm really not that interested in Columbia,

492
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:49,809
but the thought of me going there horrifies my mother

493
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:51,427
so I have to keep it in the mix, you know?

494
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:52,747
Do I ever.

495
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:55,113
Princeton's a good school, but Jamie goes there.

496
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:56,070
- That's your boyfriend? 
- Yes.

497
00:26:56,291 --> 00:27:00,069
He goes there, and if I go there, it's going to look like I went there just to be with him.

498
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:04,232
Suddenly I'm Felicity without the hair issues and I'm not terribly comfortable with that.

499
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:06,387
But look at it like this -

500
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:09,720
not going to a school you wanna go to just because your boyfriend is there

501
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:12,157
is just as bad as going to a school you don't wanna go to

502
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:14,118
- just because your boyfriend isn't there. 
- I guess.

503
00:27:14,318 --> 00:27:16,009
If you wanna go to Princeton, go to Princeton.

504
00:27:16,193 --> 00:27:17,878
If you wanna go to Yale, go to Yale.

505
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:20,259
Leave Jamie out of it. Leave your mother out of it.

506
00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:24,550
Just decide whatever it is you wanna do and do it.

507
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:25,900
I can try that, I guess.

508
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,952
- Thanks. 
- You're welcome.

509
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,326
What are you doing?

510
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:35,316
- I'm giving you a hug. 
- Why?

511
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:39,192
Just give into it, baby. Come on, you can do it. That a girl.

512
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:44,380
Unclench the fists, Paris. Unclench the fists. Yeah, there you go.

513
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:45,909
Sash, I'm home!

514
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:50,446
What's up, Lily-Lou?

515
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:51,869
Want some pineapple on your pizza?

516
00:27:52,028 --> 00:27:52,949
- Yes. 
- Yes.

517
00:27:53,534 --> 00:27:54,911
- Does she do that a lot? 
- All the time.

518
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,339
- You ever find it a little weird? 
- All the time.

519
00:27:57,702 --> 00:27:59,923
Listen, why don't you give me a minute here.

520
00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:02,944
Make it two, two minutes.

521
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:06,888
Three, and do a special knock before you come in, maybe a -

522
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:09,201
I'll tell you what, I passed a bookstore back on the boardwalk,

523
00:28:09,335 --> 00:28:10,688
why don't I just go check it out for awhile?

524
00:28:10,794 --> 00:28:13,099
Okay. But I thought the knock idea was kind of cool.

525
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:32,462
So, last week when you said you were going to Sacramento

526
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:35,227
to check out a potential supplier, you actually went...

527
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,750
To Connecticut to see Jess.

528
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,271
That was quite an elaborate story you made up.

529
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:41,529
- I do have a gift. 
- Of course I didn't believe you.

530
00:28:41,663 --> 00:28:44,248
- Okay, it's not a big gift, but... 
- Why didn't you tell me?

531
00:28:45,385 --> 00:28:46,179
I don't know.

532
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:50,244
You're nodding your head. Why are you nodding your head?

533
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:52,098
You're shrugging your shoulders.

534
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:54,038
You're nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders.

535
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:56,786
Why are you nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders?

536
00:28:56,977 --> 00:28:59,409
Will you stop nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders?

537
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,231
- Sasha, come on. 
- I'm gonna pick up the pizza.

538
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:01,984
Just have it delivered.

539
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:04,984
The delivery guys are too stoned after six to find the house, it'll take forever.

540
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:06,792
I didn't know how it was gonna go, okay?

541
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:08,173
I didn't know if he was even gonna be there

542
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:10,493
or if he was gonna wanna talk to me or slug me or -

543
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:11,313
- I get it. 
- Sash.

544
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:13,381
- I'll see you later, roomie. 
- Do not do that.

545
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:16,919
We are not roomies. We are partners, we're soul mates.

546
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:19,740
You just traveled cross-country to see your son for the first time

547
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:22,674
since he was born and you didn't tell me. We are roomies.

548
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,287
I'm sorry.

549
00:29:25,044 --> 00:29:26,750
Get the extra mattress out of the closet.

550
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:28,301
- What for? 
- For Jess.

551
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,518
- For Jess to do what? 
- For Jess to sleep on.

552
00:29:30,697 --> 00:29:32,341
- Jess is sleeping here? 
- Isn't he?

553
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:33,309
I don't know.

554
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:35,576
Jimmy, you didn't ask him if he's staying the night? 

555
00:29:35,628 --> 00:29:37,947
Did you ask him how long he's here for? 

556
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,684
- Did you ask him anything? 
- Should I have?

557
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:41,179
Jimmy, he could be in trouble.

558
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:42,657
What, he's in trouble? What kind of trouble?

559
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,035
How would I know what kind of trouble?

560
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,417
You're the one that just said he was in trouble.

561
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,779
I said he could be in trouble.

562
00:29:46,943 --> 00:29:50,609
He could be running from the cops, or attempting to hop across America on one foot,

563
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:53,493
or he really did come all the way from Connecticut

564
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,869
just to have pizza with his father who he's not seen or heard from in seventeen years.

565
00:29:59,206 --> 00:30:00,573
What are the odds it's the last one?

566
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,334
Do what you want. Talk to him, don't talk to him, I am not your mother.

567
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:08,120
I don't care. I'll be back. Lily, come on.

568
00:30:16,855 --> 00:30:21,561
Now, Sabrina, college is a very important time in a young girl's life.

569
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:25,150
- You need to be properly attired. 
- I'm sure, but...

570
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:30,935
Trust me, a young girl is completely and solely judged by her appearance.

571
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:35,727
All right, let's begin. I always start every wardrobe from the top.

572
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,617
The hat.

573
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:41,297
Remember Sabrina, it's the first thing that God sees

574
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:43,013
when you walk outside in the morning.

575
00:30:43,483 --> 00:30:46,740
Well, I'm exhausted. I feel as if I've tried on every dress in town.

576
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:47,648
So is it the blue?

577
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:49,494
Yes, I think it's the blue.

578
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:52,224
I think it's quite suitable for my granddaughter's graduation.

579
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,323
- Hey. Hi hon, hi Mom. 
- Hey.

580
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:56,526
- What are you doing here? 
- I just came to pick Rory up.

581
00:30:57,103 --> 00:31:01,051
- Miss Celine. 
- Oh my God, it's Natalie Wood!

582
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,287
Look Sabrina, it's Natalie Wood.

583
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:07,292
Oh, Miss Celine, I can't believe it, you're still... working.

584
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:09,675
Oh, I tried to retire once.

585
00:31:09,854 --> 00:31:11,998
Olivia deHavilland wouldn't hear of it.

586
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,126
How are you? How's Mrs. Walter Cronkite.

587
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,979
Lovely. Thank you for asking, Natalie.

588
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:20,257
I left the suits upstairs. I'll just go up and get them.

589
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:22,096
No, I'll get them.

590
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:25,631
It's who I am, the keeper of the clothes.

591
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:29,264
- Delight to see you again. 
- Same here, Celine.

592
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:35,941
Oh my God, she was like a thousand when I was ten, I can't believe it.

593
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:38,183
You should've seen all the clothes that Grandma tried on today.

594
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:41,209
She picked out a beautiful blue dress for graduation.

595
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:43,273
I'd like to see that, Mom.

596
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:44,861
It needs to be altered.

597
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,527
Oh, sure. I'll see it at graduation, I guess.

598
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:54,016
So I'm sorry I didn't give you advanced notice that I was coming over.

599
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:55,890
I don't need advanced notice, Lorelai.

600
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:57,226
Okay, you just seem tense.

601
00:31:57,635 --> 00:31:58,762
No, I'm just tired.

602
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,602
And busy. I have a very busy evening ahead of me.

603
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:03,032
Oh, I'm sure you do.

604
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,844
- Dinner's ready, Mrs. Gilmore. 
- No, it's not.

605
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:08,166
- I just checked it and it's... 
- I was in there ten minutes ago

606
00:32:08,265 --> 00:32:11,301
- and it still had another forty minutes to go. 
- But it's really brown and...

607
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:14,030
Lupe, please do not argue with me. It's not ready.

608
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,611
Now go in there and make the salad.

609
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,754
- What? 
- The salad's ready.

610
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:20,603
Lupe!

611
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:24,265
Mom, it's seven o'clock.

612
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:26,421
- So? 
- That's your dinnertime.

613
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,656
- I don't have a dinnertime, Lorelai. 
- You don't have a dinnertime?

614
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:30,620
No, I don't.

615
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:32,907
So all the years I grew up in this house,

616
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:36,630
we did not sit down to dinner at exactly seven o'clock every single night?

617
00:32:36,794 --> 00:32:38,468
- No. 
- I just imagined that?

618
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:41,652
Lorelai, I don't know what your obsession with dinnertime is.

619
00:32:41,765 --> 00:32:44,131
My obsession with dinnertime is that it was always at seven o'clock,

620
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:46,542
now all of a sudden, it's not. Is it because I'm here?

621
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,088
- That's ridiculous. 
- It is.

622
00:32:48,263 --> 00:32:50,892
I'm here, and if you served dinner,

623
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:53,715
Miss Manners would insist that you invite me to stay and you don't want to,

624
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:57,611
so you're going to pretend that dinner is suddenly whenever you feel like it.

625
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,275
Lorelai, do not get dramatic.

626
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:04,304
Dinner is not ready, and even if it was, I would still not be able to invite you to stay

627
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,348
because your father and I have plans tonight.

628
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:08,262
We are eating quickly and then leaving.

629
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:09,351
To go where?

630
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,328
- The Thompsons. 
- For what?

631
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:13,264
- Book club. 
- What book?

632
00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:15,277
- Lovely Bones. 
- Did you like it?

633
00:33:15,532 --> 00:33:18,558
It's not my taste but I respect the attempt.

634
00:33:19,302 --> 00:33:20,340
Now I know where I get it from.

635
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,850
We'll have dinner another time, all right?

636
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:24,363
So, are you kicking us out?

637
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:26,601
I told you, we have plans.

638
00:33:26,745 --> 00:33:28,665
Or do you just wanna get that dinner of yours that's been ready

639
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,807
for ten minutes now on the table?

640
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,759
Lorelai, please.

641
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:34,358
Tell me this - if I couldn't stay but Rory could, would you want her to?

642
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:37,272
Of course I would, but as I told you, your father and I have plans.

643
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:40,149
So she can't stay even if I'm gone?

644
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:41,204
No, she can't.

645
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:44,911
Emily, for heaven's sake, it's 7:10. Why aren't we eating?

646
00:33:45,044 --> 00:33:48,777
Oh, hi, Dad. Listen, Rory was gonna stay for dinner if you guys don't have plans.

647
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:50,235
Of course we don't have any plans.

648
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,453
Oh, I'm thrilled, Rory is staying.

649
00:33:52,668 --> 00:33:55,673
You just livened up a very boring night in the Gilmore house.

650
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:57,393
Enjoy your dinner.

651
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:59,398
And Mom, get yourself an agent

652
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:02,445
'cause you're wasting that talent of yours in dinner theater.

653
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:03,509
Mom, wait.

654
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:14,701
Mom, wait. Where are you going?

655
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,348
I'm gonna drive in a circle backwards really fast

656
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:20,189
to reverse the Earth's orbit to go back in time to before

657
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:22,402
I made the insane decision to come here in the first place.

658
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,653
- You came here to pick me up. 
- What was I thinking doing that?

659
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,420
You were thinking, 'Hey, wouldn't it be great for my daughter

660
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:28,488
not to have to walk all the way back to Stars Hollow.'

661
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:31,131
A thirty-mile hike never hurt anyone. God, I can't believe her.

662
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:32,615
- And I can't believe you. 
- Why?

663
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,115
- You were gonna leave me here? 
- So you could have dinner with them.

664
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:37,280
I never said I wanted to have dinner with them.

665
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,399
You said I wanted to have dinner with them, and then you stormed out.

666
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:43,860
Okay, I'm sorry. I just, I finally realized that I can't do this anymore.

667
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:45,974
I can't come back here anymore, I'm done.

668
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:48,298
I'm sorry. I never should've asked you to pick me up.

669
00:34:48,365 --> 00:34:49,527
It's okay. It's good, actually.

670
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:52,508
Now I can stop feeling guilty for not talking to them.

671
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:54,657
I can go back to the way things were before.

672
00:34:54,811 --> 00:34:56,112
We share a nose and that's it.

673
00:34:56,419 --> 00:34:58,175
- So we're going? 
- Yes, we're going.

674
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,530
Okay, I have to go get my books. Please be here when I come back.

675
00:35:11,714 --> 00:35:13,637
- Are you staying? 
- No, I have to go, Grandma.

676
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:16,587
All right, I guess we'll just see you at graduation then.

677
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:17,401
I guess you will.

678
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:21,026
I swear, I don't know what to do with that mother of yours, I really don't.

679
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,444
Everything has to be such a scene.

680
00:35:22,848 --> 00:35:24,348
I think you're being really stupid.

681
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:36,090
- So, Souplantation... 
- Hang on, I'm almost at the end of this chapter.

682
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,098
Okay, let the raving begin.

683
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:41,998
A room full of all you can eat food.

684
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:44,429
Soup, salad, pizza, pasta, chicken wings,

685
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,227
ice cream, rainbow sprinkles.

686
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,161
How did I not know about the rainbow sprinkles?

687
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,414
- I have no good answers for you. 
- We are going back with Tupperware.

688
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,672
- It's turning yellow. 
- Ah, shoot.

689
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,479
- Come on, gun it. 
- I can't.

690
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:56,591
Mom, we have to get home.

691
00:35:56,703 --> 00:35:59,052
Rory, I already have two tickets. I cannot get another.

692
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,837
Oh, I can't believe you stopped.

693
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:03,076
I can't believe you wanted me to go.

694
00:36:03,154 --> 00:36:04,168
There's no one around.

695
00:36:04,315 --> 00:36:06,989
Now no one's around, but the second I run that light,

696
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:11,177
a police car, four helicopters, the Canadian mounties and the crew of Cops

697
00:36:11,248 --> 00:36:13,522
- jump out of a dumpster and I'm toast. 
- Paranoid.

698
00:36:13,936 --> 00:36:16,497
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, my friend.

699
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,240
All right, I guess we wait.

700
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:27,926
Do you think Luke will know we went to Souplantation?

701
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:29,230
Not unless you tell him.

702
00:36:29,384 --> 00:36:31,667
But maybe he'll be able to tell. They'll be a glow.

703
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:33,731
An all-you-can-eat glow.

704
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:36,578
He'll see the glow, he'll know we cheated, and he'll never give us extra fries again.

705
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:46,280
Mom, why did just bolt away from us?

706
00:36:46,634 --> 00:36:48,645
Maybe he saw the glow.

707
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:50,189
Mom.

708
00:36:51,497 --> 00:36:54,068
Okay, first of all, I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

709
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:58,876
I just thought with all the stuff you were doing, maybe I should wait.

710
00:36:59,107 --> 00:36:59,977
What's going on?

711
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:02,797
Jess is gone.

712
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:05,430
- Gone where? 
- I don't know.

713
00:37:06,454 --> 00:37:08,190
Luke knows, but he didn't tell me.

714
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:12,327
But he doesn't seem to think he's coming back.

715
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:15,552
Neither do I.

716
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:21,200
Are you okay?

717
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:23,692
Yeah.

718
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:26,493
Forget this.

719
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:54,623
Hey, when you say 'I'm going to check out a bookstore on the boardwalk',

720
00:37:54,695 --> 00:37:55,990
- you be more specific. 
- What?

721
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:57,910
I have been wandering around for over an hour.

722
00:37:58,038 --> 00:37:59,354
I've been to three different bookstores.

723
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,586
I have been worried sick about you, you hear me?

724
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:02,805
- Sorry. 
- Outside.

725
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:03,845
- But... 
- Outside.

726
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,308
- Are you in trouble? 
- What?

727
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,074
You know, when you left home, were the cops after you?

728
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:20,125
No 'cause they shouldn't be or no 'cause they haven't found the head yet?

729
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:21,524
What's up, Jimmy?

730
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:24,171
- You just showed up here, man. 
- I know I did.

731
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,666
No call, no letter, just like...

732
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:28,396
Just like you showed up in Stars Hollow with no letter, no call.

733
00:38:28,492 --> 00:38:31,206
- Were you in trouble? 
- We're not talking about me, we're talking about you.

734
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:33,024
- I'm not running from the cops. 
- Then why are you here?

735
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:34,007
Why'd you come to Stars Hollow?

736
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:36,188
Hey, listen, Mr. Double-Talk, I need an answer here.

737
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,002
Well, so do I.

738
00:38:37,171 --> 00:38:39,358
You show up, you don't talk to me, you don't say anything.

739
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:40,954
You just have a cup of coffee, then you left.

740
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,106
Why'd you come if you didn't even wanna talk to me?

741
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:44,820
- I did wanna talk to you. 
- You did?

742
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:46,172
Of course I wanted to talk to you.

743
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:49,289
You think a person travels all the way across the country just to listen to a Bowie song?

744
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:51,513
Granted, a classic off Ziggy, but still.

745
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:54,025
So, what, you're telling me you just chickened out?

746
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:55,030
Yeah.

747
00:39:01,363 --> 00:39:03,687
- Well, I came to see you. 
- Okay.

748
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:07,251
And I thought maybe I could crash here for a little while.

749
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:10,800
Just a little while.

750
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:15,796
I don't need my own room or anything. I can just sleep on the couch.

751
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:18,049
Or the extra mattress we keep in the closet.

752
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,872
Sure, that'd be fine, too.

753
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,530
You know, Sasha's always right.

754
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:24,102
It drives me crazy. No matter what the situation, she's always right.

755
00:39:24,418 --> 00:39:24,962
Jimmy.

756
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:27,299
I'd love to be right just once in awhile, you know?

757
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:28,334
It wouldn't be for long.

758
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,288
Do you know she called the Super Bowl five times in a row?

759
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:31,738
Who does that? What is she, a witch?

760
00:39:31,851 --> 00:39:33,919
You know what, say no if you want.

761
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:36,511
- Jess, man, come on, you can't stay here. 
- Why not?

762
00:39:36,617 --> 00:39:37,396
- 'Cause you can't. 
- Why not?

763
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:38,440
- 'Cause you can't. 
- Why not?

764
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,417
Because you can't.

765
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:43,825
I'd ask "why not" but it doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere.

766
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:46,463
Look at me, Jess. I'm not a father.

767
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:49,336
I was never a father. I left you because I wasn't a father.

768
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:52,326
I mean it, the minute the cigar was finished, I was like, "What the hell are you doing?

769
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:54,860
You can't take care of yourself. How are you gonna take care of someone else?"

770
00:39:55,004 --> 00:39:57,378
- That's not why... 
- I can't take you in, I can't raise you.

771
00:39:57,543 --> 00:39:59,744
Raise me? I'm eighteen! I'm raised.

772
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:01,070
I can vote, I can be drafted.

773
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:04,250
It's a little late to throw me a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle birthday party.

774
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,725
I thought you didn't come here to bust my balls.

775
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:07,526
- I didn't. 
- Well, then put the bat down, man.

776
00:40:07,635 --> 00:40:11,070
I don't need a daddy. I just need a place to crash.

777
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:13,426
Do you even understand that it's only been the last five years

778
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:15,438
that I've even started to put my life together?

779
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:16,758
You don't wanna be around me.

780
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:19,360
I am a screw-up. That is my genetic code.

781
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:21,977
the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.

782
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:22,934
Don't say that.

783
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,761
You're young, you can do anything you want.

784
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:26,850
A month. Just let me stay a month.

785
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:29,620
Are you listening? I have nothing to offer you. Nothing.

786
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:32,738
You have nothing? I have nothing!

787
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:36,297
I have no place to go. I can't stay at Luke's, I can't stay in Stars Hollow.

788
00:40:36,419 --> 00:40:37,792
My mother is a wackjob.

789
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,583
I mean, you're saying you're this loser and what,

790
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:42,527
you don't wanna take me off this terrific path I'm headed down right now?

791
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:44,616
I'm not graduating high school.

792
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:46,665
I don't know what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life,

793
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:48,606
but something's telling me I better find out soon

794
00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:51,897
or I'm gonna be that guy out there on the boardwalk selling the hemp hats.

795
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:58,753
I have one of those.

796
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:01,052
It's a good hat.

797
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:08,516
Well?

798
00:41:10,698 --> 00:41:12,028
I have to talk it over with Sasha.

799
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,096
Just tell her I'm a dog.

800
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:16,474
Great idea.

801
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:20,119
Maybe you can sit there and lick yourself while she decides, you know, help sell it.

802
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:23,605
Thank you, Jimmy.

803
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:26,637
If she says it's okay, then we'll see.

804
00:41:26,811 --> 00:41:28,659
- Fine, we'll see. 
- It may not work out.

805
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:29,837
I totally understand.

806
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:33,288
But I'll ask and if she says it's okay, then we'll see.

807
00:41:35,177 --> 00:41:35,817
We'll see.

808
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,025
Oh my God, I'm so tired.

809
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,709
Here's a crazy thought, how about going to bed?

810
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:46,641
I have to study.

811
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:50,984
Or, better yet, make a pot of coffee and once again, get no sleep. Just as good.

812
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:53,917
- What's this? 
- Oh, that's just...

813
00:41:54,189 --> 00:41:56,282
Yale needed my Social Security number for something.

814
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:02,978
- Look who became a soche. 
- What?

815
00:42:03,102 --> 00:42:05,160
You have a lot of signatures in here, little girl.

816
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,315
Everybody signs everybody's yearbook. It's polite.

817
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:11,811
"Rory, have a great summer. BFF. Amber."

818
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:15,349
- Hey, Amber BFF'ed you. 
- Yeah, I feel truly blessed.

819
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,688
"Hey, Aurory Borealis."

820
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:19,875
Okay, can't talk to this one ever again.

821
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:24,229
"You have been my inspiration, my rock, my light. I loved you in South Pacific."

822
00:42:24,715 --> 00:42:27,070
- When did you do South Pacific? 
- What?

823
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:29,773
Some dipstick named Shauna thinks you were in South Pacific.

824
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,974
Oh, Shauna tends to get people mixed up.

825
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:33,091
Oh, okay.

826
00:42:42,263 --> 00:42:44,273
Hey, you know what's weird?

827
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,005
A lot of the kids in here are calling you a valedictorian.

828
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:50,617
Is that anything like a dirty skank,

829
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:53,151
'cause if it is I'll kick their plaid butts up and down the sidewalk.

830
00:42:55,552 --> 00:42:57,350
Were you named valedictorian?

831
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,209
Yes, and you know what that means?

832
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,399
One more stupid speech that I have to write, that I have no time to write,

833
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,858
but nevertheless, I have to write.

834
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:04,867
Hey, listen,

835
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,671
my little Holly Hunter in Broadcast News,

836
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:13,068
I'm gonna let you freak out and study like a mad woman

837
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:14,973
and stress yourself out until finals,

838
00:43:15,168 --> 00:43:18,393
but once they're over, we are gonna celebrate big time...

839
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,391
'cause this is amazing.

840
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,251
Yeah, it is.

841
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:30,692
Okay, now go make Mommy nervous.

842
