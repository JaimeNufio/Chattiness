1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,818
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:04,902
I'm Dean.

3
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:06,362
- Max Medina.
- Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,364
You had a desperate need for cornstarch?

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,366
I have very important thickening needs.

6
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,578
- I'd like to see you sometime.
- Are you asking me out on a date?

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,624
I got kissed, and I shoplifted.

8
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:20,126
At some point in your life,
you have to decide...

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,712
that some guy
is worth opening that front door for.

10
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:24,130
- Rory...
- Yeah.

11
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:25,882
...I love you.

12
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,094
We just broke up.

13
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:32,056
Maybe we need to
take a little time away from each other.

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,226
I'm planning on despising everyone
who says, 'Hey, how's it going?'

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,644
You're on.

16
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:39,898
- Hey, how's it going?
- Rachel.

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,358
Your Rachel?

18
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:42,943
You're Rachel?

19
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:45,361
- Is she staying?
- I don't know.

20
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,947
- Do you want her to?
- I don't know.

21
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:51,242
I'd hate to think that I raised a kid
who couldn't say 'I love you. '

22
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,831
I really... miss you.

23
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,092
Dear God Almighty Mr. Mirkle!

24
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,430
- Hey!
- What?

25
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:13,934
- You are not sleeping through this.
- Through what?

26
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:16,603
The freaking Blue Man Group
is outside our house!

27
00:01:16,687 --> 00:01:19,731
- I was sleeping through it.
- It had to have woken you up.

28
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:23,318
No, my insane mother,
Margot Kidder Gilmore, woke me up.

29
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,126
- How are you today?
- Good. How are you?

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,212
Good. What are you doing?

31
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:42,964
- Fixing your porch rail.
- That's right.

32
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:45,885
You are. You're fixing my porch rail...

33
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:48,470
at 6:30 in the morning!

34
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:51,140
- It was the only time I could do it.
- Why?

35
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:54,060
It was broken.
I noticed last time I was here.

36
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:57,814
- It could hurt somebody.
- Luke, we sleep around here, okay?

37
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,816
We like it. It makes us pretty...

38
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:02,527
and keeps us from killing
our crazy friends!

39
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,321
You're gonna wake the neighbors.

40
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:06,823
Could you pound one more thing
while you're out here?

41
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:07,949
Your head!

42
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:11,495
And a 'for sale' sign on the lawn,
'cause we're moving.

43
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:14,457
So that's two things:
The sign and your head.

44
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,707
And in that order...

45
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:19,420
'cause otherwise you'll be too dizzy
to do the sign thing!

46
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:23,758
Shoot!

47
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:26,970
- You're locked out?
- You don't exist.

48
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:30,473
You shouldn't have closed the door.

49
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,602
Lorelai, sugar!

50
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,397
You're waking up
the entire neighborhood. Please!

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,481
Excuse me!

52
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:40,025
- I am officially annoyed.
- Well, don't blame me.

53
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,360
Blame...

54
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,073
- He was right here.
- Yeah, I know.

55
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:46,866
Get her back to bed, doll.

56
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:49,118
- He was banging on the...
- I know.

57
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:52,956
It was something on the porch.
It was broken. I'm not crazy.

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,042
- He was banging on something.
- I know.

59
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,939
- Michel, get that, please.
- I cannot.

60
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,525
We've been over this.

61
00:03:57,609 --> 00:03:59,777
We all cover the phone. That includes you.

62
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:03,281
Don't misunderstand.
I wanted to answer it, I truly did.

63
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:06,367
But today, I'm suffering from ennui.

64
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,954
- Ennui?
- Severe ennui.

65
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:12,666
You know what ennui is, yes?

66
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,252
Yes, Webster's defines ennui...

67
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:18,130
as a lazy, soon-to-be-out-of-work
French concierge...

68
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:21,258
- who won't answer the phone.
- I've made my peace with the fact...

69
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:23,886
that everyone who calls here
is a notch above brain dead.

70
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,930
And that the pennies
I am thrown each week...

71
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:30,268
are in exchange for me dealing
with these people in a nonviolent manner.

72
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:34,147
And usually that is fine, but today,
sorry, lady, I have ennui.

73
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:35,649
So, you're sleepy?

74
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:38,818
- It's a metaphysical angst.
- So you want to go beddy-bye?

75
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,490
- You make light, it increases my ennui.
- Okay, that's it.

76
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,241
Come on, you need coffee.

77
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,245
I need coffee, extra strong.

78
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,413
Double caf, triple caf. No, forget the caf.

79
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,375
Throw in the whole cow,
and serve it to this man right here.

80
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,335
What's wrong with you?

81
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,003
I don't know.

82
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,174
It might sound a little weird,
but I think I've got ennui.

83
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,509
You explained ennui to her.

84
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,262
She asked me what was wrong
with me, so I told her.

85
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,014
Michel, you know
that Sookie ends up thinking...

86
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,683
she's coming down with whatever illness
other people have.

87
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:09,810
No!

88
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,062
No? What was that conversation
last week...

89
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,606
when I had to convince you,
you didn't have a prostate?

90
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:16,150
How is Al?

91
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,823
- Hello?
- Is this a bad time?

92
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:24,618
For the hotel industry, but not for you.

93
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,953
I've only got a second,
but I wanted to say hi.

94
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:30,331
- Thank you for last night.
- It was a good night.

95
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,209
Several novels will be written about it.

96
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:35,754
I say we do it again, and next time,
I'll be the gypsy queen.

97
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,965
The more I see you,
the more I want to see you.

98
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,343
- Same here.
- It's like a vicious circle.

99
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:42,428
- It's an achy feeling.
- Like withdrawal pains.

100
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:43,930
Totally distracting.

101
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:45,432
And completely wonderful.

102
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:46,682
I gotta go.

103
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,352
- No, don't.
- Okay.

104
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,020
I gotta go.

105
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:51,354
- Don't.
- Okay.

106
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,648
This would be another example
of a vicious circle.

107
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:55,984
- So we should both go.
- We definitely should.

108
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,862
- So...
- Hang up.

109
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,572
- No, you hang up.
- Vicious circle.

110
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:01,908
Bye.

111
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,743
You look happy.

112
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,247
What's the opposite of ennui?

113
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:10,083
Off-ui.

114
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,376
Hey, I'm cured!

115
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,213
I had the weirdest dream last night.

116
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:17,299
We were in our house,
but it wasn't our house.

117
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:19,717
- It was a Kentucky Fried Chicken.
- I'm hooked.

118
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:22,429
I had to get dressed,
but my clothes were in the back.

119
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:25,599
And the guy manning the giant oil vat
would not let me through.

120
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:27,393
Oh, my God! That's so weird!

121
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:30,897
When you said 'oil vat,' that
reminded me, I had this dream last night.

122
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,357
We were swimming in a pool,
only it wasn't water.

123
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,859
It was oil or honey or something.

124
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:36,027
- Hey.
- What?

125
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,821
- You totally did the thing.
- What thing?

126
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:40,156
Where one person is describing
their dream...

127
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,741
it reminds the other about theirs...

128
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,618
and suddenly it's all about their dream.

129
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:46,580
The first person is standing there
like, 'What about my dream?'

130
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:48,707
I'm sorry. The oil-vat guy was mean.

131
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,920
Yes, and we knew him.
He used to live in town.

132
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:55,172
That guy who used to run
the auto body shop...

133
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:57,341
before Maybin Hewes bought it.
Remember him?

134
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:59,135
Of course you do. He was really skinny.

135
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,762
- Peter Stringbean?
- No.

136
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:04,515
That was the tall circus-freaky guy
who worked for him.

137
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:07,101
- This was the owner. What was his name?
- I don't know.

138
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:09,688
Yes, you do. Come on.
It's gonna bug me all day.

139
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:12,358
He was short and fat and his name was...

140
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:14,943
- Johnny McShort-and-Fat?
- Don't mock.

141
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:22,076
Who was the guy who used to run
the auto body shop?

142
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,288
- That Stretch Cunningham guy?
- No, the Dick Tracy guy.

143
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:27,582
Big, always had a half-smoked cigar
in his mouth?

144
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,251
Yes. What was his name?

145
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:32,128
- It was Jim something-or-other.
- Had an 'ing' at the end.

146
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:34,172
- Yes, Banning.
- Lanning.

147
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:36,007
- Dunning.
- That's it.

148
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:39,595
Hey, Jim Dunning was the Dick Tracy guy.

149
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:46,018
Jim Dunning, that's the Dick Tracy guy.

150
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,188
The Dean box.

151
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:52,442
Okay. I know I was supposed
to throw it away...

152
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:54,027
but I couldn't.

153
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:57,322
I mean, you're young,
and your head's all weird...

154
00:07:57,406 --> 00:07:59,032
and you don't have any perspective...

155
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,284
because of that whole young,
weird-headed thing.

156
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:03,536
So please listen to me before you get mad.

157
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:06,540
You're gonna want that stuff one day...

158
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:09,460
when you're old and married
and looking back and thinking:

159
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:11,546
'I certainly had an interesting life. '

160
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,091
And then you can pull out all
your old-boyfriend boxes, which is good...

161
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,969
because I threw away stuff
I'd kill to have today.

162
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,889
Look, I put it in with the Max box...

163
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:23,642
so they could chat
and keep each other company...

164
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:26,227
and commiserate about
how they had a Gilmore girl...

165
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,896
and lost a Gilmore girl.

166
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,147
Sorry.

167
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:32,943
Thanks.

168
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:17,908
What I wanted to say was:

169
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,536
'Janie Fertman,
you are a vacuous bimbo...

170
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:22,579
'who'll turn letters as a profession
one day.

171
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,874
'And you'll know which one to turn
only when it dings and lights up.

172
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,710
'I have no desire to stop
and talk to you ever. '

173
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,463
But what I said was, 'What, Janie?'

174
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:33,425
And then she goes,
'You're cheerleader material. '

175
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:37,471
Just like that! I couldn't believe it.
I almost went full matrix on her.

176
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,640
- Have you heard a word I've said?
- Nope.

177
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:42,642
I resent that. I'm a witty conversationalist.

178
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:43,811
What?

179
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:46,355
- I'm going in.
- You can't.

180
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:48,274
- I'm going in.
- It's Thursday afternoon.

181
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:50,192
- I know.
- He works on Thursday afternoons.

182
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:52,361
- We're talking you-know-who.
- I know.

183
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,488
- Oh, my God!
- Calm down.

184
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:57,324
- You're making a spectacle.
- You're getting back with Dean!

185
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,660
If you keep jumping like that...

186
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:01,621
I'll videotape it
and send it as your cheerleader audition.

187
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:03,957
- When did this happen?
- Nothing's happened.

188
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:06,668
I don't even know what I'm doing exactly.

189
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,169
Or what he's thinking...

190
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:10,547
or whether he's burned
all my letters and pictures...

191
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:13,133
or hates me or what. But I'm going in.

192
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:14,718
I so encourage this. I love you.

193
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:16,470
But you've been mopey, dopey...

194
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:19,473
and about 12 other melancholy dwarves,
for the past five weeks.

195
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:21,600
- I miss the old Rory.
- I miss the old me, too.

196
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:24,813
- I've been feeling bad for the new Rory.
- She's staging a comeback.

197
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:26,981
May it be more successful
than Peter Frampton's.

198
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:28,817
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

199
00:10:53,677 --> 00:10:55,762
- Rory?
- Taylor, you scared me.

200
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:58,056
What are you doing?
You're walking around like...

201
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,600
- Like what?
- Dare I say, like a shoplifter.

202
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:02,185
I'm not here to shoplift.

203
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,814
- You fit four of the eight characteristics.
- I do?

204
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,567
You're alone. You look nervous.
You're meandering in an aimless fashion.

205
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,571
- And you're wearing a baggy coat.
- I tend to run cold.

206
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,697
So, what are you here for?

207
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:15,575
I'm looking for your checkout boy.

208
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:18,495
I had a question,
and I didn't want to bother you.

209
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,206
He's stacking on 6. Over here, please.

210
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:27,672
Mikey, this is Miss Gilmore.
She needs some help. Take care, Rory.

211
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:29,172
Watch her.

212
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,674
Yeah?

213
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:36,597
I was just wondering,
do you like working here?

214
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:37,807
What?

215
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:41,978
I mean, do you enjoy
the whole box-boy trade as a profession?

216
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,564
- No.
- Okay, good.

217
00:11:44,648 --> 00:11:47,442
So, I'm just gonna cross that off my list.

218
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,862
Thank you for your time.

219
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:54,783
- Well?
- He's not there.

220
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:56,326
But he always works Thursdays.

221
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,997
I guess he's taking
Thursday afternoons off now.

222
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,540
- That's not good.
- How's that not good?

223
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:04,293
- That means he's moved on.
- What are you talking about?

224
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:06,754
He's met
one of those Thursday-afternoon girls.

225
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:08,297
What's a Thursday-afternoon girl?

226
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:09,591
They're slutty girls...

227
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:13,595
that get guys to switch their Thursday
afternoons with another checkout guy...

228
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,973
so they can go do
slutty Thursday-afternoon things.

229
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:17,474
You're reading too much into this.

230
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:19,684
- I shouldn't have gone in.
- It was good to go in.

231
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:22,521
Taylor thinks I'm casing the place.
Like I'd shoplift there.

232
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:24,231
You have shoplifted there.

233
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:25,649
I'm gonna ask you a question.

234
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:28,528
I want you to be more honest
than you've ever been.

235
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:31,155
Have you ever seen him
with another girl at school?

236
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,281
No!

237
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:34,117
- You'd tell me, right?
- Yes.

238
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:37,037
I wouldn't because it would break
your heart. But I haven't.

239
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,623
You swear on the life
of the lead singer of Blur?

240
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:41,792
On the soul of Nico, I swear to you...

241
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:44,170
that I have not seen Dean
with another girl.

242
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:45,337
Okay.

243
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:48,382
- He's miserable.
- Fine.

244
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,967
- Suicidal.
- Good.

245
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,929
- And in desperate need of a haircut.
- Thank you.

246
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,034
- You should decorate this thing.
- I did.

247
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:17,538
With something other than
a bunch of dead, black and white women.

248
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:20,374
- What, like curtains?
- You know what I mean. I did mine up.

249
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:21,459
I saw that.

250
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:25,005
The naked picture of the Siamese twins
is particularly classy.

251
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,340
- You know what these are?
- They look like tickets.

252
00:13:27,382 --> 00:13:28,883
To P.J. Harvey.

253
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,885
You have good taste. I'll give you that.

254
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,513
You're into P.J. Harvey, right?

255
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:35,265
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- I'm all-knowing.

256
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,227
- How godlike of you.
- One of these is for you.

257
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,812
I don't think we should go
to a concert together.

258
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:42,690
- Reason?
- It would seem like a date.

259
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:45,234
It would seem like a date
because it would be a date.

260
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:48,155
- I can't date you, Tristan.
- I give you permission.

261
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:50,281
And on that humble note...

262
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:54,661
Rory, favor, big one.

263
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:56,955
- Look at the face.
- Sure. What?

264
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,458
Can I get your Biology notes
from Tuesday? I was out.

265
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,168
- To lunch.
- Please.

266
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:03,379
I have them at home.
I can bring them later.

267
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:05,756
- Thank you.
- One more, and you're done.

268
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:10,428
So, I've decided
I'm now completely into Judy Garland.

269
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,597
Did you see the TV movie? Pretty intense.

270
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:14,766
I think they used
my mother's medicine cabinet.

271
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,268
She was Courtney Love of her day.

272
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,103
Show me a trend, I'll show you Madeline.

273
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:20,022
- Judy Garland is trendy?
- Completely.

274
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:21,940
She's neo-addict retro chic.

275
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:23,900
No one tells me these things.

276
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:25,903
What are those?

277
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:27,947
- P.J. Harvey tickets.
- Really?

278
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:30,241
- Who are you going with?
- Rory.

279
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:33,703
- What? Rory's going out with you?
- Yes, she is.

280
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:39,209
- I didn't think she liked him.
- Neither did I.

281
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,129
Do you think she's mad?

282
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,548
What are you two waiting for,
a tram? Let's move.

283
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,718
Oh, yeah. She's mad.

284
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:49,386
Flutter.

285
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:51,513
Quick.

286
00:14:56,936 --> 00:15:00,189
And your hearts are broken.

287
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:02,567
Your prince has betrayed you.

288
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,819
You've been shot with an arrow...

289
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:08,156
and now, you're dead.

290
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:09,949
Hi, Patty.

291
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,244
- Lorelai.
- Hey, Rachel.

292
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,789
- Have you seen Luke around?
- He's probably at the diner.

293
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,333
He was supposed to be at the diner,
but he's not.

294
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,296
We were supposed to meet for lunch,
but he didn't show.

295
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,590
- Again. I made tuna.
- Nice.

296
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,553
He comes back upstairs for
a little break between lunch and dinner.

297
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,597
But recently, he's been...

298
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,851
Other places, your place, actually.

299
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,314
- Rachel, he's just fixing some things.
- I know.

300
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:44,153
The porch rail, a couple roof shingles,
then the porch rail again...

301
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,322
after he fell off the roof
onto the porch rail.

302
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:48,324
- Yeah, he's been telling me.
- Good.

303
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:51,369
Look, if you see him,
could you tell him to just...

304
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:53,496
- I don't know, check in?
- Yes. Will do.

305
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:54,956
Thanks. Bye.

306
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,253
Hello?

307
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:53,560
- Hold it right there!
- It's only me.

308
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:56,104
- You scared me half to death!
- Who'd you think it was?

309
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:58,607
I don't know! I heard thudding upstairs...

310
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,734
and Rory weighs, like, 10 ounces.

311
00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:02,528
It either had be an escaped elephant...

312
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:05,281
or some strange, large man
who should not be in the house.

313
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:06,616
How did you get in here?

314
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,785
- Through the back door.
- The back door's locked.

315
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,079
That's why I came.
The back door lock was broken.

316
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,164
- It was fine.
- It was cheap.

317
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:15,750
The back door lock came with the house.
It's been fine.

318
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:17,795
It's the kind of lock burglars look for.

319
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:21,048
- Why do they look for it?
- It's easy to break into. I proved that.

320
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:23,300
- You proved that by...
- Breaking in.

321
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:26,011
- Oh, my God!
- It's the only way I could get in.

322
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:28,639
You have crossed over
into the dark side, Luke.

323
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:30,308
It's not that big a deal.

324
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:33,394
- You broke into my house!
- I'm gonna fix it.

325
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,230
- Step away from that lock.
- What?

326
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:38,274
Get off. Come, sit down.

327
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:42,112
You have almost no free time
with your work at the diner.

328
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:45,324
And lately,
every spare moment has been spent...

329
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:47,450
- not with Rachel.
- That's not true.

330
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:50,121
She was looking for you,
she didn't know where you were.

331
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:52,206
- I'm not hiding from her.
- I didn't say that.

332
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,624
You were implying it.

333
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,502
Someone's sensitive about the accusation.

334
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:59,005
- I think I'm hiding.
- I think you are, too.

335
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:01,299
It's just a little weird
having her in my place.

336
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:04,553
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- It was... Is.

337
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,138
I'm just...

338
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:10,559
I've just been living alone since... Forever.

339
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:14,021
And I got used to putting the milk
someplace in the fridge...

340
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:17,191
and finding it in the exact same spot,
you know what I mean.

341
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,652
- We don't keep milk in the house.
- Then, cookies.

342
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:22,697
- Cookies never make it out of the car.
- You know what I mean.

343
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:26,034
Maybe you can train Rachel
to use a magic marker...

344
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:28,411
to mark the milk exactly where you left it.

345
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:29,579
It's not just about milk.

346
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:32,541
I'm not used to someone expecting me.

347
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,753
- Expecting you to...
- Come home, do things, be with her.

348
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:39,172
Most people would kill
to have that in their lives.

349
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:42,218
I know. But I'm different. I'm a loner.

350
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,931
I don't want to hear
about the romance of being a loner.

351
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:48,725
Some guys are just naturally loners.

352
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,601
- Yes, lonely guys.
- Independent guys.

353
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:52,395
- Sad guys.
- Maverick guys.

354
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,772
- Lee Harvey Oswald.
- John Muir.

355
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:55,565
- The Unabomber.
- Henry David Thoreau.

356
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:58,193
Every one of these, sad and lonely guys.

357
00:18:58,235 --> 00:19:01,238
It's not what I thought it would be like
having Rachel back.

358
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:04,575
It's not the fantasy I was toting around
all these years.

359
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:06,536
Life is not a fantasy.

360
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,413
Maybe you have to lower
your expectation bar a little bit.

361
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:11,332
So you're saying that life is...

362
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,459
just settling for whatever comes along?

363
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,503
You think having Rachel is settling?

364
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,881
No, I didn't mean that. Rachel's great.

365
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,549
And she's crazy about you.

366
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:25,221
If her worst trait is she's a milk whore,
you have it pretty good.

367
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,185
And you just need to give
this situation a fair chance.

368
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,436
I know.

369
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:36,358
And that starts with ceasing work
on the Winchester Mystery House here.

370
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,739
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

371
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:01,635
How are you today?

372
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:03,637
- Fine.
- Good.

373
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:06,516
Are you here to see my brother?

374
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,643
No, not at all.

375
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:11,855
I'm with the Girl Scouts.

376
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,275
I'm gonna be a Girl Scout someday.
I'm a Brownie now.

377
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:18,153
Good. That's an excellent stepping stone.

378
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:20,698
Where's your uniform?

379
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:22,407
We don't do uniforms anymore.

380
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:26,329
We're trying to blend in,
relate better to the average person.

381
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,998
It was a very successful strategy
for the Hare Krishnas.

382
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:30,750
- You look like someone.
- I do?

383
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,252
You're the girl in the pictures.

384
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:34,587
- What pictures?
- The ones Dean has in his room.

385
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:36,047
Dean has pictures in his room?

386
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:39,509
There's a funny one of you sticking out
your tongue. He had a lot.

387
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,010
- Wait, has or had?
- What?

388
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,138
You went from 'has' to 'had':
A big difference.

389
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,806
- It is?
- Yeah.

390
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,519
- What's your name?
- Clara.

391
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:50,688
- You're a pretty girl, Clara.
- Thanks.

392
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:52,815
- Now, is it has or had?
- I don't know.

393
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,818
You do know. 'Had' is past-tense,
'has' is present. Now think.

394
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,903
- I'm trying.
- Can you go to his room now?

395
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:00,865
- He doesn't like me there.
- Sneak in, he'll never know.

396
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,745
Oh, no, Clara, don't cry.
I didn't mean to make you cry.

397
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:08,498
I'm a nice person. I'm a Girl Scout.

398
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:10,375
- Clara.
- Bye.

399
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:15,505
- What's the matter?
- She scared me.

400
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:18,050
- Who?
- The Girl Scout.

401
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:29,980
We've got food, drink, reading material...

402
00:21:30,064 --> 00:21:33,108
chocolate-covered espresso beans.
Have I left anything out?

403
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,611
- That about covers it.
- You're such a good provider.

404
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:38,197
- I try my best.
- Sure you want to go to this thing?

405
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:41,867
You're always talking about these
town meetings. I've to see one for myself.

406
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,913
- They're never dull.
- Lf you're lucky, you'll see a crazy lady...

407
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:47,248
throwing French fries at those
she disagrees with.

408
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:48,583
Like last time.

409
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,919
- So, were they cold?
- No, I was just full.

410
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,629
I forgot.

411
00:21:54,757 --> 00:21:56,216
One for you...

412
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:59,470
- and one for you.
- What are these?

413
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:03,140
Those are rings, and the diamonds
are actually candy so you can eat it.

414
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:05,935
Max, that's very sweet,
but we're not eight.

415
00:22:06,853 --> 00:22:08,396
- What do you got?
- Grape. Yours?

416
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:09,939
- Red.
- Trade you.

417
00:22:11,524 --> 00:22:13,609
Enough of this arguing.

418
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:16,028
It's time to put this to a vote.

419
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:20,742
All right, now, let's see a show of hands.
All those in favor?

420
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:22,452
Rats, it started already.

421
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:24,204
All those opposed?

422
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:28,625
Lorelai, you don't even know
what we're voting on.

423
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:30,545
Yeah, but I'm agin it!

424
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:34,966
All right, the nays have it.
Let the record reflect it.

425
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:37,801
Lorelai, I hope
that's not food in those bags.

426
00:22:37,886 --> 00:22:39,554
Food is not allowed at town meetings.

427
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:42,307
No, Taylor, it's diapers for the little ones.

428
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:44,517
- The what?
- Dorsal fins and Cucamonga.

429
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:45,643
What did she say?

430
00:22:45,728 --> 00:22:48,898
I confuse him till he loses
his train of thought. Then he moves on.

431
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:52,818
I'd like to open the meeting up
for miscellaneous issues.

432
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,820
- I have an issue.
- Who are you?

433
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:56,822
- The town troubadour.
- The what?

434
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:59,283
You've seen him, Taylor, with his guitar.

435
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:01,160
Right, the guitar.

436
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:03,037
He plays on all the street corners.

437
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:05,289
He loiters on street corners.

438
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:07,834
- We are two peas in a pod.
- Scary thought, Taylor.

439
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:09,669
- Go on, honey.
- Thank you.

440
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:12,338
I've been the town troubadour
for six months now...

441
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:14,341
and I think I've done a pretty good job.

442
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:16,468
And then he shows up.

443
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,556
There's no room for a second troubadour
in Stars Hollow.

444
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,641
Clearly.

445
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:24,519
This is the silliest thing I have ever heard.

446
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:26,812
Hear them out. It can't hurt.

447
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:30,858
These are not fries.
They are Fahrvenugen Soogan Dugan.

448
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,987
I opened the floor for issues of substance.
This does not qualify.

449
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:38,158
Don't be uncool, Taylor.
Music is substance.

450
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,284
Watch out, Morey.

451
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:42,871
After that anatomically explicit epithet
your wife yelled at me earlier...

452
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,122
you're both on probation.

453
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:47,043
All I'm asking is that
the town troubadour laws be enforced.

454
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:49,379
There are no town troubadour laws.

455
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,088
There ought to be something.

456
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:52,840
I've got the town handbook right here.

457
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:55,885
I don't get this, people.
This man is practically a vagrant.

458
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:58,304
Where do you even live?
What do you do for a living?

459
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:00,723
- I don't want people to know those things.
- Why not?

460
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:04,228
- That's part of being a troubadour.
- What is part of being a troubadour?

461
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,687
The mystique.

462
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:08,690
This is absolutely ridiculous!

463
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:12,569
Do you subscribe
to this troubadour mystique?

464
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:14,947
I run a Kinko's in Groton.

465
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:18,367
You see? That proves it.
He doesn't respect the code.

466
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,830
You're not supposed to talk,
you're not supposed to run a Kinko's.

467
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:24,290
You are supposed to
speak through your music.

468
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:25,750
That's the whole point.

469
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:27,920
- What is your scam, buddy?
- My scam?

470
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:32,174
If you are using the fine people
of Stars Hollow to make a quick buck...

471
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:36,387
No, Taylor, he doesn't accept money.
I know, I tried.

472
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:38,931
He may not now, but he will.

473
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:42,226
This troubadour act
is a money-making scheme.

474
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:43,602
Why else would he be doing it?

475
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:46,106
Sometimes you have something to say,
but you can't...

476
00:24:46,148 --> 00:24:50,068
because the words won't come out,
or you get scared, or feel stupid.

477
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,155
So, if you could write a song and sing it,
then you could say what you need to.

478
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,450
It would be beautiful,
and people would listen...

479
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:58,952
and you wouldn't make
a complete idiot out of yourself.

480
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:00,579
But all of us can't be songwriters.

481
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:03,499
So some of us will never be able to say
what we're thinking...

482
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,585
or what we want others to know
we're thinking.

483
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:09,130
So we'll never get the chance
to make things right again, ever.

484
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,428
So, give this guy a license.

485
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,978
I liked that little speech.

486
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:24,187
That's the Girl Scout.

487
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,442
In the interest of not talking
on this subject for another second...

488
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,695
I hereby designate mystique guy
over here...

489
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:32,988
the official town troubadour.

490
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,326
And no other troubadour
may usurp his territory...

491
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,328
meaning this other guy.

492
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,711
Do you want some fries? We have extra.

493
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,005
No, Rachel's minding the store,
so I should probably get going.

494
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,509
- Yeah, I agree.
- I knew you would.

495
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,067
You're back.

496
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,737
Yeah, there's nothing much pressing
at the town meeting.

497
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,322
Okay, the bread shipment's all put away...

498
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,658
and I sent Caesar home
since it was pretty dead.

499
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,952
- Good call.
- Thanks.

500
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:26,504
So you're leaving?

501
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:31,009
- Yeah.
- Were you even gonna tell me?

502
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:34,429
I was waiting for you to get back,
so I could say goodbye.

503
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:37,891
Yeah, you at least always do that.

504
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:40,310
So, go.

505
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:43,272
Don't you even want to know why?

506
00:26:43,356 --> 00:26:46,025
- I know why.
- I don't think you do.

507
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:48,319
It's just like all the other times, Rachel.

508
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:52,240
You're the 'anywhere but here' girl.
You're restless, you're bored.

509
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:55,576
- It is what it is.
- That's not it.

510
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:57,913
Then what is it? Is there another guy?

511
00:26:57,996 --> 00:26:59,372
- No.
- Then what?

512
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:01,041
It's another girl.

513
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,292
What?

514
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:04,127
You're telling me...

515
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:06,713
The other girl isn't for me, Luke,
it's for you.

516
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:08,090
Now, that's crazy.

517
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:09,258
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

518
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:13,179
You feel you need a different excuse
this time, to mix things up a little. Fine.

519
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:17,017
- But you are not leaving because of me.
- I'm sure you tried, Luke.

520
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,810
But admit it. Your heart wasn't in it.

521
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:21,938
My heart was in it.
I was here. I didn't leave.

522
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:28,195
I don't get this. What're you talking about?
Another girl? What other girl?

523
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,950
Rachel, no.

524
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:34,785
You don't mean...

525
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:37,788
She and I are just friends.
I told you that a thousand times.

526
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:40,625
No. You told it to me once.

527
00:27:41,585 --> 00:27:44,171
And you could barely get it out then.

528
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:47,465
This is crazy.

529
00:27:48,592 --> 00:27:50,594
You've got it wrong here.

530
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,222
It's not...

531
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:55,724
She and I are...

532
00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:58,644
I'm gonna go.

533
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,441
I'll miss you.

534
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:08,112
Stay in touch.

535
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:12,326
Rachel, come on.

536
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,165
So don't wait too long, okay?

537
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:19,500
To what?

538
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:21,668
To tell her.

539
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,224
Madeline, I got the notes you wanted.

540
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:36,767
- No, thanks.
- These are the ones you asked for.

541
00:28:36,852 --> 00:28:39,771
- The Biology notes from Tuesday.
- No, thanks.

542
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:44,902
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing's wrong with her, Mary.

543
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:48,739
Mary? Oh, no, not this
Virgin Mary thing again.

544
00:28:48,906 --> 00:28:50,741
Not virgin. Typhoid.

545
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:53,745
What?

546
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:56,539
When we met at the beginning of the year
I didn't like you.

547
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:58,541
I thought you were some rube
from the sticks.

548
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,710
- I've no patience for rubes.
- How enlightening.

549
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:02,837
But then I discovered
that you're not so dumb.

550
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,132
You even seemed modestly interesting
at times.

551
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:06,883
That's when I made a very big mistake.

552
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:09,344
I let my guard down.
That won't happen again.

553
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:12,848
- What is this about?
- It's about using people for your own ends.

554
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:15,392
About making enemies
where you should've made friends.

555
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:17,853
- How did I make you my enemy?
- I think you know.

556
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:20,523
Was it setting you up with Tristan?
I'm sorry about that.

557
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:22,900
- I thought I was just being nice.
- Sure you did.

558
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:25,695
I helped you get ready.
I loaned you my mother's clothes...

559
00:29:25,737 --> 00:29:28,239
- which I still haven't got back.
- My God, you're right.

560
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:31,576
Hope Skippy didn't have her puppies
on them. I'll check when I'm home.

561
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,411
Tell me what I did.

562
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:36,540
- Paris!
- Think about it at P. J. Harvey.

563
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:39,751
Is that what this is about?
I'm not going to P. J. Harvey.

564
00:29:39,836 --> 00:29:41,963
- Tristan says you are.
- Then he lied.

565
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,548
- I saw the tickets.
- He bought them on his own.

566
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:46,926
I'm over Tristan.
Don't back out on my account.

567
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,386
There's nothing to back out of.

568
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:50,638
I don't have time for concerts anyway.

569
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,224
I'm lining up my extracurriculars
for next year.

570
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:55,894
By the way, are you still going out for
the school paper?

571
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:57,020
You know, I am.

572
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:59,564
- You'll need a faculty recommendation.
- I can swing it.

573
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:02,067
- And the student editor's support.
- I'm not worried.

574
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:04,152
Worry. I just got the job.

575
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:09,659
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

576
00:30:09,784 --> 00:30:12,119
And don't worry. You'll have some role.

577
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:14,873
How's covering
the new parking lot landscaping sound?

578
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:15,998
Peachy.

579
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,460
Too bad I already filled the slot
for music coverage.

580
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:20,170
Record reviewing and such.

581
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:23,257
You'd have been perfect for it.
I gave the job to Louise.

582
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:24,800
Louise owns two CDs.

583
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:27,136
Yeah. Well, got to go.

584
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:34,435
Have a really good summer.

585
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:43,778
You're annoyingly on time again!

586
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:49,326
Okay. Stairs, then shoes.

587
00:30:57,585 --> 00:30:59,753
- You're all dressed up.
- I'm going out.

588
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:03,842
Sorry. I forgot my toolbox,
so I just thought I'd come pick it up.

589
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:05,551
Yeah, it's right over here.

590
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:08,012
We couldn't lift it
or we'd have brought it to you.

591
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:10,641
Then we got used to having it here,
so we named it Bert.

592
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:13,727
We'd say, 'Good night, Bert,'
and it'd say, 'Good night, girls. '

593
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:15,312
We spend too much time home alone.

594
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:18,065
- Thanks for taking care of him.
- Our pleasure.

595
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:22,236
So, Rachel left.

596
00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:25,031
- What?
- Last night she left for good.

597
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:27,158
Oh, no, Luke, I'm so sorry.

598
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:30,619
- What happened?
- It's hard to explain.

599
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:34,166
I can't believe it. I thought she was in it
for the long haul this time.

600
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:36,834
Yeah, well, she had her reasons.

601
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:38,920
Really? What?

602
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:41,673
Hello. I tried to be late.

603
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:45,010
And an utter failure at one minute past.

604
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:49,557
Max Medina, this is Luke Danes.

605
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,310
Luke owns the diner.
He has the greatest coffee.

606
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:55,355
- Right, I saw you at the town meeting.
- I saw you, too.

607
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,023
Nice to meet you.

608
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:59,818
- So, we should be going.
- Yeah.

609
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:01,236
I'm gonna get going.

610
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,448
I just left my toolbox
from when I was here earlier, fixing things.

611
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:06,908
I do a lot of little things
around here for Lorelai.

612
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,911
Yeah, you're very handy.
So, Luke, we'll talk later.

613
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,205
Yes, we will.

614
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:14,250
Although probably not tonight.
We won't be back until late.

615
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:16,878
- No, I meant not tonight.
- Oh, I misunderstood.

616
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:19,046
I meant tomorrow. So, tomorrow.

617
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,383
Absolutely. We see each other
most every day.

618
00:32:22,426 --> 00:32:25,929
- Sure. You've got the coffee.
- And she needs the coffee.

619
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:28,307
So I'll see you tomorrow,
same time as always.

620
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,975
I'd count on a little later.

621
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,187
It doesn't matter what time it is.
I'll always be around.

622
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:36,524
Bye.

623
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:42,238
So, are we going?

624
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,407
Yeah. Just wanted to make sure...

625
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:46,617
you two were done
swinging those things around.

626
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:49,620
- Someone's bound to lose an eye.
- What are you talking about?

627
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:52,040
Nothing. I'll get my purse.

628
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,586
So, not to be blunt, but is that over?

629
00:32:57,421 --> 00:33:00,090
- Is what over?
- Whatever I just walked in on.

630
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:02,467
Max, come on, that's Luke.

631
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,011
I picked something up there.

632
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:06,681
Drop it back on the ground,
kick it under the couch...

633
00:33:06,764 --> 00:33:08,724
because there is no 'there' there.

634
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,059
Hey, it's okay.

635
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:13,479
We were apart for quite a while.
I never assumed you joined a convent.

636
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:16,441
It's not like I didn't date
while we were apart.

637
00:33:17,151 --> 00:33:18,986
- You dated?
- A little.

638
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,448
- A little person?
- No, I dated a little.

639
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:26,702
Okay. I didn't expect you
to join a manvent...

640
00:33:26,786 --> 00:33:29,288
or whatever the male equivalent
of that is called.

641
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:31,415
- Who did you date?
- A monastery.

642
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:32,875
You dated a monastery?

643
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,127
A monastery is
the male equivalent of a convent.

644
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:37,171
I'll make a note for the quiz on Friday.

645
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:39,006
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

646
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:43,387
I get it. Yes, we were apart.
And I didn't exactly remain inactive.

647
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,889
- So you did date Luke?
- No, I did not date Luke.

648
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:47,975
- You can tell me.
- I did not date Luke.

649
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,268
- There was a vibe.
- There was no vibe.

650
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:53,147
What's with the questioning?
You won't tell me who you dated.

651
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:54,315
No one you know.

652
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:56,984
Did you date casual, nothing-type dating...

653
00:33:57,026 --> 00:34:00,446
or did you date get-down, soul-train
kind of a dating?

654
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:04,075
I wouldn't phrase it that way,
but to be honest, it was the latter.

655
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,369
Good. Well, I like your honesty...

656
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:09,915
because you could've lied and
left that part out to spare my feelings...

657
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,293
which would've been unnecessary.
So, thank you.

658
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:13,752
I slept with Rory's dad.

659
00:34:13,836 --> 00:34:16,004
- Change the subject.
- On my parents' balcony.

660
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:18,299
- I want to change the subject.
- You started it.

661
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:21,426
I did not mean for this to become
a who-slept-with-whom contest.

662
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:23,513
- How'd it get that way?
- I don't know.

663
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:27,517
Why do we let it get weird between us
just when it's getting good again?

664
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:28,685
I don't know.

665
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:30,562
- I don't like it.
- I don't either.

666
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:32,397
- And I'm sick of it.
- So am I.

667
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:35,859
We can't keep getting this close
to have something derail us again.

668
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:38,862
There's only one thing I could think of
that could solve it.

669
00:34:38,904 --> 00:34:42,532
Break up. I'm not interested
in a murder-suicide kind of thing.

670
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,452
We should get married.

671
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,916
Give me a clue
as to whether you're kidding or not.

672
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:51,667
I am not kidding.

673
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:55,129
- Good clue.
- What do you say?

674
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:59,259
Nothing. Max, you did not
just propose to me.

675
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:00,510
Yes, I did.

676
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:03,597
No. A proposal has to be
something more...

677
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,433
than the desperate desire
to end a bickering match.

678
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:09,311
- It was more than that.
- It has to be planned.

679
00:35:09,395 --> 00:35:11,313
It should be magical.

680
00:35:11,397 --> 00:35:14,942
There should be music playing,
and romantic lighting...

681
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:19,363
and a subtle buildup
to the popping of the big question.

682
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:22,534
There should be
a thousand yellow daisies...

683
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:26,246
and candles and a horse.
I don't know what a horse is doing there...

684
00:35:26,288 --> 00:35:28,874
unless you're riding it,
which is a little over the top.

685
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:31,085
It should be more than this.

686
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:34,797
You're right.

687
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:36,424
I am right.

688
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:39,552
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

689
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:46,601
Let's start the evening over.

690
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,062
Ding-dong.

691
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:54,568
- Now I'm five minutes late.
- You're making good progress.

692
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,282
Let's go?

693
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,459
Bye-bye, Bert.

694
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,471
- I'm a little tired of this game.
- What game?

695
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:23,890
- Are we meeting there?
- What are you talking about?

696
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:24,976
The concert's tonight.

697
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,311
Hope you and the empty seat
have a lot of fun.

698
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:29,772
- I'm starting to get a little irritated.
- So am I.

699
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:30,982
What are you mad about?

700
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:33,068
You're telling everyone I'm going with you.

701
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:34,485
- Just a couple.
- You told Paris.

702
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:37,489
Paris and I had just started getting along.
Now she hates me.

703
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:40,158
If the damage is done,
you might as well come with me.

704
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,536
Never. I am never going
anywhere with you, ever.

705
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:47,041
- These tickets cost me a fortune.
- They cost your daddy a fortune.

706
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,585
I don't know anyone else
who's into this stupid guy.

707
00:36:49,669 --> 00:36:51,295
P. J. Harvey's a woman.

708
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:53,464
What are you doing?

709
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:55,550
You'll get them back when you agree.

710
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:58,677
You're pathetic, Tristan.
Keep the books. I'm leaving.

711
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:03,975
Dean?

712
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,940
What are you doing here?

713
00:37:10,357 --> 00:37:11,942
- I'm leaving.
- Don't go.

714
00:37:12,026 --> 00:37:13,694
- I shouldn't have come.
- Wait!

715
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:15,237
- I feel like an idiot.
- Why?

716
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:18,574
I come all the way out here,
and I see you with him. It's just great.

717
00:37:18,658 --> 00:37:20,576
- No, Tristan was just...
- I don't care.

718
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,078
He's got your books.

719
00:37:22,162 --> 00:37:23,955
He took them.
He wouldn't give them back.

720
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,874
Please, just tell me why you're here.

721
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,085
- I don't even know.
- Yes, you do.

722
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:30,920
'Cause I thought you...

723
00:37:31,004 --> 00:37:32,422
- Forget it.
- No, say it.

724
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:35,842
I thought you were trying to talk to me.
You came to my house.

725
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:37,469
- That wasn't me.
- It was you.

726
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:39,555
It must've been someone
that looked like me.

727
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,058
My sister recognized you
from the pictures in my box.

728
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,518
In what box?

729
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:48,022
The box of stuff I have of us, pictures,
and letters, and everything from you.

730
00:37:48,106 --> 00:37:49,524
You have a Rory box?

731
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:52,694
What about the town meeting?
All that stuff about writing a song?

732
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:54,112
I don't know what I was saying.

733
00:37:54,196 --> 00:37:56,156
That had nothing to do with me?

734
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:59,910
I must have imagined it all then.

735
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:05,541
- Your boyfriend's waiting.
- He's not my boyfriend.

736
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,084
- I hate him.
- Whatever.

737
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:08,419
- Dean.
- What?

738
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:09,879
- Stop!
- Why?

739
00:38:11,798 --> 00:38:14,050
Because I love you, you idiot.

740
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:48,629
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you speak English?

741
00:38:48,712 --> 00:38:49,963
Are you listening to me?

742
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:52,674
- What took you?
- Sorry. I got here as quickly as I could.

743
00:38:52,758 --> 00:38:55,594
- Do not address him. He's a scoundrel.
- I'm just doing my job.

744
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:58,305
Am I not the head man
in charge of floral deliveries?

745
00:38:58,389 --> 00:39:01,058
And one of the few men
who would proudly declare that.

746
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:02,893
- I'm doing my job.
- Stop saying that.

747
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:06,105
- This has to do with flowers we ordered?
- Flowers we did not order.

748
00:39:06,189 --> 00:39:07,190
I'm just doing my job.

749
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:09,192
Say that once more
and I'll punch your nose.

750
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:10,568
- It must be a mistake.
- No.

751
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,111
I did not order these flowers.

752
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:14,948
It says that you have to be here
to personally accept them.

753
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:17,492
I have to be here? Well, that's...

754
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:20,579
- I am head man in charge of flowers.
- I just do what I'm told.

755
00:39:20,663 --> 00:39:23,332
- I warn you not to say that.
- It's not what I said before.

756
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:27,086
It's a little variation
that will still lead to a punch on the nose.

757
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:35,804
Daisies, no less.

758
00:39:35,888 --> 00:39:38,974
As if I would order
these pitiful little things.

759
00:39:39,224 --> 00:39:42,727
Foul things, these daisies.
Just a notch up from weeds.

760
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,314
And look how many.
There must be at least...

761
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:48,651
A thousand of them.
A thousand yellow daisies.

762
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:52,112
That's right,
there's exactly a thousand of them.

763
00:39:52,197 --> 00:39:54,866
Order states that
there's to be exactly a thousand.

764
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,869
Not 1,001, not 999, but 1,000.

765
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:00,246
You ask for 1,000, I bring 1,000.

766
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,457
I don't question the orders.
I merely fill them.

767
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:05,127
A job well done, Mr. Adolph Eichmann.

768
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:32,614
I couldn't find a horse.

769
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:34,908
- You didn't have to...
- Don't say anything.

770
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,284
Please.

771
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:40,915
You were right last night.
I shouldn't have proposed to you like that.

772
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,667
It was stupid.

773
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,918
It was the wrong place
and the wrong time.

774
00:40:45,003 --> 00:40:47,463
I kicked myself the entire night
for doing it.

775
00:40:47,506 --> 00:40:49,966
But you were wrong about something, too.

776
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,510
I didn't propose to you
because we were fighting.

777
00:40:52,594 --> 00:40:54,387
I proposed because I love you.

778
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:57,600
We're in a bad pattern, Lorelai,
and we have to break it.

779
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:01,436
And other than that murder-suicide thing,
which would be illegal and messy...

780
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:03,105
I can only think to be impetuous.

781
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:06,859
No, listen. I woke up this morning...

782
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:08,486
and I realized...

783
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,532
that I have studied
and taught the great literature all my life.

784
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:17,078
And those stories are replete with
characters that let opportunities slip by.

785
00:41:17,496 --> 00:41:20,123
But what I teach
is more than just literature.

786
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:21,541
It's lessons in life.

787
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,502
If I don't follow those tenets...

788
00:41:23,586 --> 00:41:26,839
I'm not the man I thought I was,
the man I want to be.

789
00:41:27,298 --> 00:41:29,216
God, you talk so good.

790
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,759
I don't want an answer now.

791
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:33,887
I've thought about this.
I want you to do the same.

792
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:36,474
I love you, Lorelai Gilmore.

793
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:39,352
And I know this to be true.

794
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:42,314
I'll talk to you later.

795
00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:52,407
Oh, my.

796
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:28,904
- Rory!
- You made me spill.

797
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:31,533
- Sorry. She's not here?
- No. What's the matter?

798
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:34,661
I messaged her to meet me here at 7:00.
She's supposed to be here.

799
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:35,829
- So what time is it?
- 7:00.

800
00:42:35,913 --> 00:42:37,956
- I'm damp.
- Where is she?

801
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,042
Calm down. Is everything okay?

802
00:42:40,126 --> 00:42:43,212
- Yes. Maybe. I think so. I don't know.
- What's going on?

803
00:42:43,254 --> 00:42:46,215
Big things,
potentially life-changing things.

804
00:42:46,257 --> 00:42:47,341
Get a promotion?

805
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:49,552
I became head salesman
of Northwest Territories.

806
00:42:49,594 --> 00:42:51,721
I run an inn.
There's no place to promote me to.

807
00:42:51,763 --> 00:42:52,805
So it's not work.

808
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:54,932
- Where's she?
- Have some coffee while you wait.

809
00:42:55,016 --> 00:42:57,852
I couldn't take coffee.
Big hole through the roof, very bad.

810
00:42:57,936 --> 00:43:00,146
You're saying no to coffee? This is big.

811
00:43:00,355 --> 00:43:01,564
Can't tell me what it is?

812
00:43:01,607 --> 00:43:03,984
I just really need to tell Rory first.

813
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:06,779
But you're happy about this news?

814
00:43:07,822 --> 00:43:10,199
I might be. Maybe.

815
00:43:11,576 --> 00:43:14,871
It's like a,
'I can't believe this is happening to me'...

816
00:43:14,954 --> 00:43:16,539
kind of a mind-blowing moment.

817
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:19,292
There she is. I'm gonna go.

818
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:24,339
The whole town gets one today.

819
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:28,761
Bye.

820
00:43:48,365 --> 00:43:49,991
- He just...
- I just...

821
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:51,409
You first!

822
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,913
Me first!
