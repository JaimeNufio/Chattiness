1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,462
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,005
- I'm going in.
- You can't.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,798
- I'm going in.
- It's Thursday afternoon.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,634
- I know.
- He works on Thursday afternoons.

5
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,760
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,053
You're getting back with Dean!

7
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,305
- You know what these are?
- They look like tickets.

8
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,389
To P.J. Harvey.

9
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,474
I can't date you, Tristin.

10
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,185
- Have you seen Luke around?
- He's probably at the diner.

11
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,063
He was supposed to be at the diner,
but he's not.

12
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,815
We were supposed to meet for lunch,
but he didn't show.

13
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,485
You have almost no free time
with your work at the diner.

14
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,530
And lately,
every spare moment has been spent...

15
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,365
- not with Rachel.
- That's not true.

16
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,158
- Who are you going with?
- Rory.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,160
- What?
- Rory's going out with you?

18
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,245
Yes, she is.

19
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,580
But recently, he's been...

20
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,834
Other places, your place, actually.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,086
- I think I'm hiding.
- I think you are, too.

22
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,296
It's just a little weird
having her in my place.

23
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,049
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- It was... Is.

24
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,385
Max Medina, this is Luke Danes.

25
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,595
Luke owns the diner.
He has the greatest coffee.

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,013
I'm not going to P.J. Harvey.

27
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,224
- Tristin says you are.
- Then he lied.

28
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,433
I saw the tickets.

29
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,645
I just left my toolbox
from when I was here earlier, fixing things.

30
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,106
I do a lot of little things
around here for Lorelai.

31
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,357
Rachel, no.

32
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,235
She and I are just friends.
I told you that a thousand times.

33
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,822
We can't keep getting this close
to have something derail us again.

34
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,700
There's only one thing I could think of
that could solve it.

35
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,328
Break up. I'm not interested
in a murder-suicide kind of thing.

36
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,330
We should get married.

37
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,498
Dean?

38
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,420
- I feel like an idiot.
- Why?

39
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,881
I come all the way out here,
and I see you with him!

40
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,341
A proposal has to be something more...

41
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,178
than the desperate desire
to end a bickering match.

42
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,097
- It was more than that.
- It has to be planned.

43
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,057
It should be magical.

44
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,560
There should be
a thousand yellow daisies.

45
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,895
- Dean.
- What?

46
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,563
- Stop!
- Why?

47
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,983
Because I love you, you idiot.

48
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,903
Not 1,001, not 999, but 1,000.

49
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,238
I don't question the orders.
I merely fill them.

50
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,698
I don't want an answer now.

51
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,659
I've thought about this.
I want you to do the same.

52
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,245
I love you, Lorelai Gilmore.

53
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,872
Oh, my.

54
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,983
You should get married in Italy.

55
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,985
All the way from home, the same topic.

56
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,987
There's tons of stuff going on in the world.

57
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,113
- Like?
- Balkans.

58
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,907
That was ages ago. Read a paper.

59
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,534
They make my hands black.

60
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,411
You should walk down the aisle
to Frank Sinatra...

61
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,039
with a huge bouquet of something
that smells really good.

62
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,123
Pot roast.

63
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,209
You should wear a long veil
with your hair up.

64
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,753
I'll take any other subject in the world
for $200, Alex.

65
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,421
Why don't you wanna think about this?

66
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,091
I haven't made my mind up
about the 'yes' or 'no' part...

67
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,135
so I don't want to start fantasizing
about dresses and flowers...

68
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,138
or doves and tulle until I do.
So please change the subject.

69
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,808
The bridesmaids should pick
their own dresses.

70
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,393
You know how in All in the Family...

71
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,270
Edith would be yapping about something...

72
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,981
and Archie would pretend to hang
or shoot himself?

73
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,233
Something about this moment
made me think of that.

74
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,695
- Fine, I'm done. I'm taking these to Lane.
- Okay. Meet me at Luke's.

75
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,322
- Get me a paper, please.
- But my hands.

76
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,761
- No. No more talking.
- But, Mama, please.

77
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,347
Not for you to think about.
All under control.

78
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,515
Give me a hint.

79
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,476
Children will know what their parents
think they can handle.

80
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,354
- I'm sorry, was that the hint?
- Back to work.

81
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,071
I came to bring you
some of my mom's flowers.

82
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,113
Thanks.

83
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,533
- Are you okay?
- No. I'm not okay.

84
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,327
What's wrong?
Did she find your CD burner?

85
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,331
My parents are sending me to Korea
for the summer to visit my cousins.

86
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:53,085
- So?
- They won't tell me when I'm coming back.

87
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,003
What do you mean they won't tell you?

88
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,506
I mean, they bought me a one-way ticket.

89
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,884
- One-way. The plane goes there and stops.
- Are you sure?

90
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,553
I called the airline to confirm it...

91
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,180
and my parents were in their room
whispering all morning.

92
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,183
When my mother came out,
she looked very happy. She was humming.

93
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,687
I swear, they're planning on sending me
to Korea for the rest of my life.

94
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,480
It's like that Sally Field movie...

95
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,899
where the husband
wouldn't let them return from Iran.

96
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,860
Except, I won't have to
keep my head covered.

97
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:18,944
Calm down.

98
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,280
Are you listening?
I am being shipped off to Korea.

99
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,615
I think you're freaking out
a little prematurely.

100
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,243
- Really?
- Yes, let's think about this.

101
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,122
Maybe there's some deal with the airline
and that's why the ticket's one-way...

102
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,292
or maybe they haven't worked out
the plans with your cousins yet...

103
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,254
or there's a weather consideration
or a holiday you don't know about...

104
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,465
I'm really going to miss you.

105
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,802
Lane, come here, please.

106
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,554
I have to go.

107
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,640
You've been a good friend.

108
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,981
Hi, Bootsy.

109
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:59,776
So, apparently,
they shoot a gland from a pig's head...

110
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,447
in Ivana Trump's rear end twice a month
to keep her looking young.

111
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,157
Hope she's not kosher.

112
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,659
I don't know. It doesn't say here.

113
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,174
- Hey.
- What? Nothing.

114
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,344
- You a Leo?
- No.

115
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,305
Thank God.
Those guys are screwed this week.

116
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,123
What're you reading?

117
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,668
God. Do not sneak up on a person
like that.

118
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,503
'InStyle Weddings. 'Very interesting.

119
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,921
No, not very interesting.

120
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,174
- Get any ideas?
- Yes, we should have cake more often.

121
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,801
Hey, Bootsy, I'll take this.

122
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,178
- No, I just...
- That's $6.

123
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,473
- Lorelai, so?
- Hi, Patty.

124
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,309
- InStyle Weddings. You said yes.
- No, not yet.

125
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,978
- She said 'yet. '
- I know.

126
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,104
I'm right here.

127
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,065
- He's a good man?
- Yeah, he's a great man.

128
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,569
I just love this. Have you told Luke?

129
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,904
No, it just happened last night.

130
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,907
Patty, stop it. I'll tell him.

131
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,034
It's not that big a deal if he just finds out.

132
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,452
Whatever you say.

133
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,290
It just so happens we are on our way
over there to have breakfast...

134
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,041
- and I'll tell Luke then.
- Be gentle.

135
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,209
Patty, Luke and I are...

136
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,504
Just friends. Yes, I know.

137
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,174
- It's true.
- Okay, let's go.

138
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,136
- It is.
- I know.

139
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,015
What is with this place?
Why will nobody believe me?

140
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,641
- They believe you.
- No, they don't.

141
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,560
I promise they believe you.

142
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,271
- You are pacifying me.
- Just a little.

143
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,024
- I don't like it.
- I'll see if I can stop.

144
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,251
I can't wait for the movie theater
to reopen.

145
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,885
Let's see, what looks good?

146
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,805
I'm so unbelievably hungry, I'll have
to order breakfast and lunch. Crazy.

147
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,974
- Mom, go tell him.
- I will.

148
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,434
- Now.
- Why?

149
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:41,355
Because in five minutes, someone's about
to be pushed through that window.

150
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,065
This is crazy.

151
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,526
Why is everybody making
such a big deal about this?

152
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,986
Because everyone knows
that Luke has a thing for you.

153
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,072
- Luke does not have a thing for me.
- Tell him.

154
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,575
We can barely have a conversation
without biting each other's heads off.

155
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,702
- Tell him.
- Everything about me repulses him...

156
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,371
my coffee-drinking, my eating habits.

157
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,499
Remember when I called him
Ranger Bob last week? He hated that.

158
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,417
Will you get me a muffin
when you're there?

159
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,961
Okay. God. Fine.

160
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,052
Hey.

161
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,929
Fresh coffee will be ready in a minute...

162
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,640
unless you want to just roll up a dollar bill
and go nuts.

163
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,350
No, thanks, I can wait.

164
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,062
- What the helI's going on with them?
- I don't know.

165
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,857
Crazy people.
The whole town should be medicated...

166
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,694
and put in a rec room
with Ping-Pong tables and hand puppets.

167
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,697
What?

168
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,574
Nothing. I...

169
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,785
I have something to tell you.

170
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,787
I have something
to share with you, actually.

171
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,164
- Share with me?
- Yes.

172
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,124
When exciting things happen in your life...

173
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,667
you wanna share them with people...

174
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,502
who you think will find them exciting...

175
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,087
- which I think you will.
- What is it?

176
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,463
It's very...

177
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,508
Exciting, I heard. I'm prepared
to jump up and down if necessary.

178
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,552
Okay, then, here it is.

179
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,890
Max has asked me to marry him.

180
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,810
Yeah, I figured.

181
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,021
- You did?
- It was obvious.

182
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,815
You two were getting kind of close,
he was around a lot.

183
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,236
Then last night
with that life-changing-thing comment...

184
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,239
I put two and two together
and figured it out.

185
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,659
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Thank you.

186
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,996
- Have you set a date?
- No, I haven't answered him yet.

187
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,332
- You're going to say yes.
- How do you know?

188
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,918
You're making a big deal
about telling me he proposed.

189
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,544
I don't think I'm making a big deal.

190
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,963
You wouldn't do that
if you weren't going to say yes.

191
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,799
I'm sharing something with you.
It is not making a big deal.

192
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,718
Sharing is a nice gesture...

193
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,929
like when you're a kid
and you have a Popsicle...

194
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,515
and you break it in two
and offer half to another kid.

195
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,558
That's sharing. That is what I'm doing.

196
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,228
- You offered me half a Popsicle?
- Yes.

197
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,065
- Okay, so, now you know.
- Now I know.

198
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,321
I'll have two blueberry muffins
and some coffee.

199
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,323
- Coming right up.
- Okay.

200
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,285
I think it's good you're doing this.

201
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,162
You do? Good. Me, too.

202
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,499
Not that I'm definitely doing it,
but if I do, then it'll be good.

203
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,792
Where are you going to live?

204
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,418
- What?
- Here? Hartford?

205
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,004
Here. I don't know.
We haven't talked about it.

206
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,423
Hartford's probably good,
closer to Rory's school.

207
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,593
- Yeah, I guess.
- Of course, it is a little far from the Inn.

208
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,428
Yeah.

209
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,807
But who knows how long you'll work
after you're married.

210
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:22,850
Excuse me?

211
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,726
But you probably already
talked about that?

212
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,563
No, but I think he and my father
have come to an agreement...

213
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,106
on how many goats I'm worth.

214
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,817
I'm just talking here. It's great, really.

215
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,903
- You're going to have more kids?
- Personal.

216
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,030
I mean, he wants kids, right?

217
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:40,576
- In the world? Yes. He wants kids.
- You haven't talked about that either.

218
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,370
What we have and haven't discussed
is none of your business.

219
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,581
Joint checking accounts?
You know his last name?

220
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:46,915
I want my Popsicle back.

221
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,835
- Fine, it's your business.
- Yes, it's my business.

222
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,422
Some people go their entire lives
without having these conversations.

223
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:57,301
My parents didn't discuss a thing
my entire childhood, worked fine for them.

224
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,805
But when my mom died, she hadn't
told Dad where the coupon drawer was.

225
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,099
Took him 10 years to find it.

226
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,852
- Used a coffee can the whole time.
- Okay.

227
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,187
I don't care what anyone says.

228
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,314
A coupon can is not as good
as a coupon drawer.

229
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,565
How are those muffins coming?

230
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,776
But you know what? You might
like a coupon can. You never know.

231
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,613
Here you go, two blueberry muffins.

232
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,156
Thank you.

233
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,283
And congratulations again.

234
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,584
- Now what's going on?
- Kirk passed out.

235
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,378
- Here's your muffin.
- Thanks.

236
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,255
How'd he take it?

237
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,133
Fine. He took it fine.

238
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,105
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, I'm just tied to the emergency brake.

239
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,524
How did you do that?

240
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,068
You know,
with a flourish and a big ending.

241
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,861
Okay, I got it. Let's go.

242
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,365
- My coat.
- It's pretty warm out for a coat.

243
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,701
It tends to cool off
the minute I get in that house.

244
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,119
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

245
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,372
- My keys.
- Mom.

246
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,916
They're in the ignition. Okay, I got them.
Let's go.

247
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,751
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

248
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:13,919
You got lost coming here.

249
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,462
- I took a wrong turn.
- Six times.

250
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:18,632
My self-preservational instincts at work,
ladies and gentlemen.

251
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,092
And the coat and the keys?

252
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,802
- I got stuff on my mind.
- Max stuff?

253
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,554
- No. Stuff stuff.
- You're lying.

254
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,472
I'm being mysterious.
That's what women do.

255
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,099
- Mom...
- Look. Doorbell. Pretty sound.

256
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,226
You always make me tell you
what I'm thinking.

257
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,604
And the lesson we've learned
is you should never become a spy.

258
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,356
You're here. Richard, they're here.

259
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,275
- Wonderful.
- Come in.

260
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,318
- No.
- Why?

261
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,279
Because you're scaring Rory.

262
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:45,367
Stop that. Get in here. Scaring Rory.
You're so silly sometimes.

263
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,705
Let's get you a drink. Put your coat down.
And are you hungry?

264
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,082
I had Antonia make some Roquefort puffs.

265
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,876
Antonia, bring the puffs.

266
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,003
Come, sit down. Richard.

267
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,464
- Say nothing until I get there.
- Hurry up.

268
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,674
Mom, what's going on?

269
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,551
The nails.

270
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,470
So, tell me what's new with you girls.

271
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,097
Nothing.

272
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:10,767
Grandma, what about you?
Did something special happen?

273
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,061
Well, as a matter of fact...

274
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,148
For goodness' sake. Richard, damn it!

275
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,276
Mom, why don't you just tell us
what's happening now?

276
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,404
All right. I can't wait for your grandfather
any longer.

277
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,948
You know I'm very good friends
with Bitty Charleston...

278
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,325
the headmaster's wife.

279
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,951
We have this little arrangement...

280
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,579
where she keeps me apprised
of the goings-on at Chilton.

281
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,624
She tells me all the gossip on the students
and their parents...

282
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,418
and any piece of information
I might find useful.

283
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,839
Well, this afternoon, she called
to tell me the class list just came out...

284
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,926
and Rory has finished
in the top three percent.

285
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:45,886
I know.

286
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,264
You do? Who do you know at Chilton?

287
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,642
Rory.

288
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,812
It wasn't definite,
but I had a pretty good idea.

289
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,940
Rory, wonderful news...

290
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,442
you finished in the top three percent
of your class.

291
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,320
Yeah, Dad, J. Edgar Hoover over here
was just telling us.

292
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,363
What?

293
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,990
I told you not to say anything
before I got here.

294
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,076
- You took too long.
- No, we already knew.

295
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,370
- It's a simple request.
- Just hang up the phone.

296
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,705
It's good news either way.
Let's all agree on that.

297
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,833
I am immensely proud of you, Rory.

298
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,292
Yes, we knew you could do it.

299
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,752
We certainly did.

300
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,755
We have to celebrate. Next week,
we will have a special dinner.

301
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,674
Grandma, all of your dinners are special.

302
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,133
This one will be extra-special.

303
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:28,804
We'll make all your favorite foods,
and you can invite some of your friends.

304
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,598
There's an excellent chance
that presents might be involved.

305
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,183
You guys do not have to do this.

306
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,561
- For the top three percent...
- We most certainly do.

307
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,522
You start late, have to catch up,
and by the end of the year...

308
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,774
you've overtaken everyone.
A true Gilmore.

309
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,025
Through and through.

310
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,277
Dinner is ready.

311
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,237
Thank you, Antonia. Shall we?

312
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,073
After the top three percent in her class.

313
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,200
Well, thank you very much.

314
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,996
Just go ahead and start without me.
I've got to check in at the Inn.

315
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,748
MicheI's there by himself.
People could die.

316
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,375
Well, hurry up.

317
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,508
- Hello?
- Where are we going to live?

318
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,552
- Lorelai?
- Where are we going to live?

319
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,054
- Well, I...
- Your house? My house?

320
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,307
- I don't know.
- We have to figure this stuff out.

321
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,102
I have a life and a kid, and both of them
require a house of some sort.

322
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,230
- Okay, but...
- I have stuff. I have a lot of stuff.

323
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:23,025
You haven't seen my closet yet,
but you would not believe...

324
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,068
the amount of stuff one person
can accumulate.

325
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:28,280
I don't even know what this stuff is,
but it's there and it's mine...

326
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,490
- and it needs a place to live.
- Well...

327
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,326
- And I want to work.
- What?

328
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,494
And I like my bank.

329
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:34,578
Okay, hold on...

330
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,080
The teller's name is Margie
and she can't count.

331
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:40,959
There's something poetic about banking
in a place where the teller can't count.

332
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,252
- Lorelai.
- What?

333
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,796
Calm down. Talk to me.

334
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,424
It's just...

335
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:54,765
If I die, I want you to know
where the coupon drawer is.

336
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,227
I would like that, too. I think.

337
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,605
Well, we need to figure
these things out before...

338
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,565
Before what?

339
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,568
- Are you saying yes?
- What?

340
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,111
Are you saying yes?

341
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,446
Why are you asking me that?

342
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,782
Because you call me, out of the blue.

343
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,535
You're panicked about
where we're going to live and bank...

344
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,828
and coupon drawers and Margie.

345
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,413
These are important things to discuss.

346
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,790
I agree.

347
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:24,503
They're extremely important things
to discuss, especially if you're saying yes.

348
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,046
Are you?

349
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,717
I am so thrilled about this.
Will you get a certificate?

350
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,802
I'm not sure.

351
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,346
They should give you
a certificate or a plaque.

352
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,098
I'll talk to Bitty about that tomorrow.

353
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,141
I can't wait to tell Telman McCabe
about this.

354
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,268
Oh, Richard.

355
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,020
He's always bragging
about that simpleton grandson of his.

356
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,605
William is a lovely boy.

357
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:46,024
- His head is shaped like a football.
- It is not.

358
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,861
If he fell asleep in the park,
someone would try to punt him.

359
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,363
- Telman is a very dear friend of yours.
- Yes, he is.

360
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,867
And one should always share
wonderful news with one's good friends.

361
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:55,993
You just want to brag.

362
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,286
I think I have a right.

363
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,246
You'd think you were the one
who finished...

364
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,039
in the top three percent of your class.

365
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,585
It was my genes.
I get to claim a little responsibility.

366
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,253
Goodness.

367
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,255
I just spilled on my shirt.

368
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,341
What are you doing?
What are they doing, Emily?

369
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,760
I have no idea. Stop that, you two.

370
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,263
- Sorry.
- Yeah, sorry.

371
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,557
What is going on?

372
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,727
I'm just really jazzed
about this whole three-percent thing.

373
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,979
Yeah, really, really jazzed.

374
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,566
Don't even try to understand, Richard.

375
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:31,028
Antonia, please bring some club soda
for Mr. Gilmore's shirt.

376
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:37,075
We're running out of clarified butter.
Chop that finer.

377
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,452
No parboiling.

378
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,082
That looks good. Add a little pinch
of oregano. I think we've got it.

379
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,918
Okay, got your lobsters.

380
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,921
Are they good?
They look good. Yes, they do.

381
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,548
It's got my hand.

382
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:56,136
Thanks. Okay, I'll be fine.
I'm a good clotter. Don't worry.

383
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,058
You are fresh, aren't you?
Okay, in the back.

384
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,937
- Michel, I'm gonna need you to move.
- In a minute.

385
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,439
- What are you doing?
- I am weighing my turkey.

386
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,524
Why?

387
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,692
A group of scientists did a study on rats...

388
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,986
where they cut their daily calories by 30%.

389
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,071
And you felt left out?

390
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,948
No, the rats lived 30% longer.

391
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:19,201
The scientists were so impressed
that they cut their own calories...

392
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,327
just like the rats.

393
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,204
It was a very nice display of solidarity.

394
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,749
I have decided to do the same.
I figure if I stay alive long enough...

395
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:29,044
these scientists will be able
to cure anything, including death...

396
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,005
therefore ensuring my indefinite existence.

397
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,007
You're going to live forever?
Like on Fame?

398
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,551
Don't speak to me.

399
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,969
Give me back my scale.

400
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,138
I have an announcement to make,
and it's big...

401
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,641
and it's fabulous
and you are not going to believe it.

402
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,893
- Goodbye.
- Wait. I got news.

403
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:48,355
Well, I'm sure it's very exciting.
Excuse me.

404
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,606
What's with the turkey?

405
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,233
He thinks he's going to live forever.

406
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,734
- Like on Fame?
- That's what I said.

407
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:56,488
A hundred years from now, I'll sit
around telling my fellow men of science...

408
00:19:56,572 --> 00:20:00,993
about the two of you, and we will giggle
like little girls at your ignorance.

409
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,995
Now I have work to do.

410
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,455
He did say 'giggle like little girls,' right?

411
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,500
Forget him.
Tell me about your fabulous news.

412
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:12,212
- I'm engaged.
- What?

413
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:13,922
I'm getting married.

414
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,007
- No.
- Yes.

415
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,801
- No.
- What?

416
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:18,969
Sookie.

417
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,556
Oh, my God. This is amazing. I'm shaking.

418
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,767
Max is a wonderful man. It is Max, right?

419
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,519
- Yes, it is Max.
- Good.

420
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,981
- I knew it. I knew you'd get engaged.
- Really? God, I didn't.

421
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,691
- You're going to be a Sadie.
- A what?

422
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:33,775
A Sadie.

423
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:37,613
Sadie, Sadie, married lady
Meet a mortgagee

424
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,448
- Funny Girl!
- Streisand!

425
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,450
- Stop it.
- Who's catering?

426
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,660
- Bobby Flay?
- Not funny.

427
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,413
- I'm making the cake also.
- Absolutely.

428
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,583
I'll start a menu. Something light
and romantic to start with...

429
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,002
something that will go wonderful
with champagne.

430
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:55,214
Truffles go wonderful with champagne.
And scrambled eggs.

431
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,298
Sookie? Honey?

432
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:59,801
I know scrambled eggs don't sound
very festive, but when you put them...

433
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:03,972
in a little quaiI's eggshell with caviar
on top, they're quite a crowd-pleaser.

434
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,183
What's with the waterworks, lady?

435
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,643
It's just...

436
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,186
I don't know.

437
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:12,814
You raised that little girl all alone,
and she is so great...

438
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,942
and you work your butt off here...

439
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,736
and you go to school
and you put up with me.

440
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,990
- You just really deserve this.
- Thank you.

441
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:27,287
Prepare yourself for the most gorgeous
Brussels sprouts ever.

442
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:31,208
Sookie, are you okay? Are you hurt?
Have you been making cutlets again?

443
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,961
Lorelai's getting married.

444
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,130
I love saying that. Married.

445
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,967
That's great. Congratulations.

446
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,885
Thanks, Jackson.

447
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,054
Do you want to look
at the Brussels sprouts?

448
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,722
Yes, I do.

449
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,936
What about some nice Brussels sprouts
with garlic olive oil for the wedding?

450
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,606
That sounds like a 'till death do us part'
kind of side dish, doesn't it?

451
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,149
I wouldn't know.

452
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,569
What do you think
is the most romantic vegetable?

453
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,989
- You know, I'm the wrong guy to ask.
- You're the vegetable guy.

454
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,783
The normal vegetable guy,
not the romantic vegetable guy.

455
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:07,995
I would have no idea
what an appropriate vegetable would be...

456
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,622
to serve at a wedding.
I've never even been to a wedding.

457
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,875
One. My cousin Bonbon.

458
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,126
Yes, that's his real name.

459
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,920
And I didn't stay long
and I didn't notice the vegetables...

460
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:19,673
so I would not be the guy to ask
about wedding vegetables.

461
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,092
I'm not the wedding vegetable guy.

462
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:26,680
Jackson's got'Panicked, my girlfriend
wants to get married' face on.

463
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,766
Yes, next time he's here,
tell him that you're pregnant.

464
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,560
- With twins.
- Why not?

465
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,480
So, what's the latest?

466
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,983
I just got off the phone
with the American Consulate.

467
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,026
And?

468
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,820
- Can you say 'Hyung Yung'?
- No, and what is that?

469
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:43,238
My Korean name.

470
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,990
There must be something you can do.

471
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,702
I'm a minor. I've been put in the custody
of family by my parents.

472
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,662
That's it. It's over.

473
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,499
You have to at least try to talk
to your family.

474
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,791
I don't know.

475
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:58,795
- Dinner.
- I have to go. Last meal.

476
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,464
Call me later.

477
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,389
Coming, Mama.

478
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,558
Do you want Tater Tots also?

479
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:14,144
- That's a rhetorical question, right?
- Right.

480
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:17,105
So, what kind of dress are you thinking of?

481
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,527
The one Stephanie Seymour wore
in the Guns N' Roses video.

482
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,529
Did you pick your colors yet?

483
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:24,947
- Yes.
- Really? What?

484
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,699
- Spumoni.
- I am planning this wedding without you.

485
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:30,828
You will have no say,
and I may not even let you come.

486
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,916
- Hello?
- Rory? Good, it's Max.

487
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,209
Hey, Max.

488
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:40,254
Look, I've been out ring shopping all day.

489
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,506
Ring shopping? Very interesting.

490
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,050
Now, I've narrowed it down
to three different rings...

491
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,511
but I want to get her something
she'll really like...

492
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:50,347
not something she tells me she likes,
but she really hates.

493
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,474
You know her taste in jewelry
better than I do.

494
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,518
I thought maybe you could give me advice.

495
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,646
Anything with the word 'foxy' on it
is a big crowd-pleaser.

496
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,690
Maybe for our first anniversary.

497
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:01,984
- Okay, I'm listening.
- Okay.

498
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:06,572
The first ring has a gold band...

499
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:10,742
and sort of a square diamond.
It's simple, but very classic.

500
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:15,080
Gold band, square diamond, simple,
classic. I'm not sure that's really her.

501
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,040
Okay. The next one...

502
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,752
is sort of an engagement band...

503
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:23,881
with small diamonds all around it,
white gold...

504
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:27,467
and there's a wedding band
that sort of fits into it, like a set.

505
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:30,929
White gold engagement band,
small diamonds around it...

506
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,390
with wedding band that fits into it.

507
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,225
That's a possibility.

508
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:36,518
What's the third one?

509
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,061
The third one...

510
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,898
is from the '20s.

511
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,566
From the '20s?

512
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,443
Large diamond in the middle...

513
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,571
diamond clusters on the sides...

514
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,116
and it's a little deco.

515
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,873
That sounds great. Good going.
She's going to be ecstatic.

516
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,876
- She's right there with you, isn't she?
- What? No.

517
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,544
I thought I heard her bark.

518
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:05,589
No, that's just a wild jackal
that hangs out here sometimes.

519
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,759
- Put Cujo on the phone, please.
- One sec.

520
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:10,385
Here, boy.

521
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,097
Hello, Max. What a pleasant surprise.

522
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,766
I just walked in.

523
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:19,394
- Hi.
- Am I late?

524
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:21,438
- No, right on time.
- Good.

525
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,108
- Are you coming in?
- In a sec. Where's your mom?

526
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,027
In the kitchen, on the phone.

527
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,987
Beginning, middle,
or end of a conversation?

528
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:33,075
It concerns jewelry, so there may
not be an end to the conversation.

529
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,660
Good.

530
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:36,537
Hi.

531
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,750
- I missed that.
- Me, too.

532
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,963
So, this whole breaking-up thing,
we tried it.

533
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,339
Yeah, we did.

534
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,132
- Didn't really work for me.
- Me, either.

535
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,552
Okay, good. So it's decided.
Breaking up, not for us.

536
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:54,596
Not that it's a bad thing.
I'm sure some people like it.

537
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,767
Sure. Cher, Gregg Allman.
I bet they give it a big thumbs-up.

538
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:00,185
Did you pick out your ring?

539
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:03,188
Yes. He's going to surprise me
with it tomorrow.

540
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,314
'20s deco?

541
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:07,109
Supposedly ripped off of Zelda Fitzgerald's
cold, dead hand.

542
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:08,193
- Hey, Dean.
- Hey.

543
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,319
When's dinner ready?

544
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,572
- Do I look like a timer?
- I thought you'd set one.

545
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:12,823
Timers are for kids.

546
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,199
Ten minutes, we're there.

547
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,284
I'll get it set up.

548
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,785
What's the movie for tonight?

549
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,704
My God, a classic.

550
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:20,831
The Joan
and Melissa Rivers Story. Starring...

551
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:21,957
Joan and Melissa Rivers.

552
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,876
A mother and daughter
torn apart by tragedy.

553
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,669
- Suicide.
- Not getting The Tonight Show.

554
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:27,296
- Mean boyfriends.
- Identical noses.

555
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:28,338
You'll laugh, you'll cry.

556
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:29,715
'Cause you're laughing so hard.

557
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,091
It'll be an evening to remember.

558
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,176
In the pivotal scene...

559
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:35,345
where a distraught Joan
gets locked out of High Holiday services...

560
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,430
'cause she's late...

561
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:40,517
I will be forced to rewind it and play it
over and over about 4,000 times.

562
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,395
You'll never be the same.

563
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,442
It's nice to have you back.

564
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,985
Thanks. It's nice to be back.

565
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,112
- We missed you.
- I missed you guys, too.

566
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:55,699
No, I mean, we really missed you.

567
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,994
You need the water bottle changed,
don't you?

568
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,954
- Desperately.
- Rag.

569
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,372
Thank you.

570
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,878
Where's Dean?

571
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,755
- Getting water.
- You're shameless.

572
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:10,881
- He offered.
- Please.

573
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:14,259
The first thing he said to me was,
'Lorelai, can I change your water?'

574
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,428
What can I do? The kid's a freak.

575
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,936
I'm so sorry
she's got you doing chores already.

576
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,479
I don't mind.

577
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,814
You will. She pulled out the mower
this morning.

578
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,442
If that movie is anything
like you described...

579
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,528
mowing might be a good alternative.

580
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:35,072
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Yeah?

581
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:38,867
My grandparents are having
this special dinner for me next week.

582
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,578
It's nothing big,
but they said I could invite someone...

583
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:44,081
and you've never seen
my grandparents' house...

584
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,750
and I'd really like you to meet my grandpa.

585
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:49,920
What?

586
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:53,924
It's just the last time I met
your grandma...

587
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:57,219
was the night of the dance,
and you know how that turned out, so...

588
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,929
The dance was a long time ago.

589
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:02,266
She's over it by now.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

590
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:03,684
You want me to go?

591
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,561
Yeah, I want you to go.

592
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,938
Then I'll go.

593
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:09,481
Good.

594
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:15,821
Oh, my. That coffee can is just so high
up there. Whatever will I do?

595
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,156
Coming.

596
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:23,495
Antonia, take this and put it
in the dining room, please.

597
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:27,416
I like that tie.

598
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,793
Yes, it's rather snappy, isn't it?

599
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,255
Don't you dare get on that phone.
They'll be here any second.

600
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,590
I'm not getting on the phone.

601
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:38,343
I'm going to give Rory that first edition
of Mencken's Chrestomathy.

602
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,681
Well, hello there.

603
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:46,685
- Well, hello there.
- Grandma, you remember Dean, right?

604
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,478
Yes, I do. Nice to see you again.

605
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,357
Thanks. Your house is great. It's huge.

606
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:55,777
- I've never seen a house this huge before.
- Thank you.

607
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:58,989
So few people bother to notice
the hugeness of the house anymore.

608
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:02,993
Mom, it was so nice of you to tell Rory
to invite a friend tonight...

609
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:06,538
seeing as this is her night.
That was really nice of you.

610
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,208
- It was my pleasure.
- Good.

611
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:13,212
Don't just stand there.
We have a celebration to attend. Come in.

612
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:25,807
So, what would everyone like to drink?

613
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,895
I'll have a white wine,
and Dean will have a beer.

614
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:31,313
- What?
- Corona, right?

615
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,941
No. I don't want a beer. I don't drink beer.

616
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,735
I'll have a water or soda or anything.

617
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:40,739
Or nothing. Not beer. Never beer.
Beer's bad.

618
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:43,909
Relax, Dean,
that's just Lorelai's little sense of humor.

619
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,745
- You're very cruel.
- Yes, it keeps me young.

620
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:50,332
I'm just going to sit here
and stare at my hands.

621
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,626
- Soda, Dean?
- Please.

622
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:55,462
- Rory?
- I'll have a beer.

623
00:29:58,257 --> 00:30:00,676
I'm sorry, Dean. We're not laughing at you.

624
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,012
- Wait, I think I was.
- I think I was a little, too.

625
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,974
Richard, there you are. Come join us.

626
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,393
Hey, Dad.

627
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,979
Grandpa, hi. This is Dean.

628
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:15,148
- Dean, this is my grandpa.
- Hi.

629
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,402
Sorry. Hi.

630
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:20,988
Hello.

631
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:25,200
- It's nice to meet...
- Does everyone have drinks?

632
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,957
Yeah. We all have drinks. Thanks.

633
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,799
Should we do the beer thing again?

634
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,427
I don't think so.

635
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:54,396
Grandma, I can't believe you found
a recipe for beefaroni.

636
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,107
It wasn't easy.
Antonia thought I'd gone insane.

637
00:30:58,275 --> 00:30:59,735
No one needs a comment from you.

638
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:02,404
No, I was just going to say
what's the secret?

639
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,323
Let's just say it's not beef.

640
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,034
- Okay. I'm done.
- Me, too.

641
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:09,495
Dean, would you like some more?

642
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:14,166
No. I'm fine, thanks.

643
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,793
Then, I guess it must be present time.

644
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,295
You didn't have to.

645
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:19,588
Yeah, Mom, you didn't have to.

646
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:22,633
Unless you got something
that'll fit me, too. If so, good going.

647
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:25,093
Here you go, Rory. Congratulations.
We're so proud.

648
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:26,720
Thanks, Grandma.

649
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,974
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- Now, go on. Open it.

650
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:32,809
Okay.

651
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:37,189
Oh, pens. All yours.

652
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,273
It's beautiful.

653
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,776
I think the top student deserves
the top tools.

654
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,444
Thank you so much.

655
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,113
Really.

656
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,410
Well, pens are very nice, but I just bet...

657
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:53,997
there is a fabulous, fancy dessert
just sitting out there in that kitchen.

658
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:56,250
As a matter of fact, there is. Twinkies.

659
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:59,837
Rory told me
that was her favorite dessert.

660
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,381
Emily Gilmore, you are one classy broad.

661
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:05,008
Antonia, please bring out the Twinkies.

662
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,386
I can't believe I just heard you
say those words.

663
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:08,720
Don't get used to it.

664
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:10,013
So, Dean...

665
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,725
where are you planning to go to college?

666
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:18,313
Start off with 'What's your
favorite baseball team?' or something.

667
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:19,565
I'm talking to Dean.

668
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:21,108
I don't know yet.

669
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,068
- You don't?
- No, not yet.

670
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:26,113
What kind of grades do you get?

671
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,031
Richard, please, don't grill the boy.

672
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:31,577
I'm not grilling the boy.
It's an easy question.

673
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,370
A's? B's? C's?

674
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:35,080
I get a mixture, actually.

675
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:38,417
A mixture? What's the ratio?

676
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,962
I'm just trying
to get to know the boy, Emily.

677
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,548
After all, Rory brings home a young man
to dinner.

678
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,092
The least we could do is find out
something about him.

679
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:48,802
He changes a mean water bottle.

680
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,846
I get a couple of A's...

681
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:54,308
a couple of B's, a few C's.

682
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:57,227
- Really?
- I'm not great in math.

683
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:59,188
Yeah. Except, who is, really?

684
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,273
Except mathematicians
or blackjack dealers...

685
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,483
or I guess Stephen Hawking doesn't suck.

686
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:06,778
But you know what else is good, Mom,
is a ho ho.

687
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,908
Because if you can't find a Twinkie,
you treat yourself to a nice ho ho.

688
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:16,497
- How long does it take to open a box?
- She's making them.

689
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,166
She's making the Twinkies?
You're kidding.

690
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,085
Richard, wasn't there a book
you wanted to give Rory?

691
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:24,963
- In a minute, Emily. So, Dean...
- Grandpa...

692
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,758
...you do know that Rory's going
to an Ivy League school?

693
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,800
I know.

694
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,928
- Harvard, Princeton, Yale.
- He said he knew.

695
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,222
You need top grades
to get into a top school.

696
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:36,266
Yeah. Rory's really smart.

697
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,602
Yeah. She is really smart.

698
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,271
- Mom?
- Why don't we all go sit in the...

699
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:44,942
How are you planning to make a living
once you graduate from this college...

700
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,777
you haven't thought anything about yet?

701
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,904
Grandpa, can we talk about
something else?

702
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,531
I'm going to get that book.

703
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,115
I asked you a question.

704
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,493
I don't know what I want to do.

705
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,246
You know, when I was 10 years old...

706
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:00,290
I knew exactly where I wanted to work.

707
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:03,335
That's because you were always
picked last for dodge ball.

708
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:05,420
I knew I wanted to go to Yale...

709
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,841
and put on a nice suit every day
and be a very important man...

710
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,801
in a very powerful firm.

711
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,470
And I knew I wanted to travel
and see the world.

712
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:14,638
That's great.

713
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:18,225
I wanted to see La Traviata
at the La Scala opera house.

714
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,271
I wanted to walk the ruins of Pompeii.
I wanted to travel the Far East.

715
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:24,273
Or be a ballerina, or a fireman.

716
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:25,732
Lorelai, this isn't funny.

717
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:29,987
It's a little funny to think of a 10-year-old
kid dreaming of the La Scala opera house.

718
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,906
Rory does. Rory wants to travel.
Rory has plans.

719
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,991
Rory's special.

720
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,784
Yes. Exactly.

721
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:37,661
Rory is special.

722
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,622
- I know that Rory's special.
- I've got it.

723
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:43,917
Dean is special, too, Grandpa.
You don't even know him.

724
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,878
- I know enough.
- No, you don't.

725
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:50,007
Dean is incredible, and he's special to me.
And I bring him here, and you attack him.

726
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,176
I will not be spoken to like that
in my house.

727
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,260
Here, give her the book.

728
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:54,428
This family has standards.

729
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:56,889
You live up to them.
You should expect that everyone...

730
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,724
you spend time with live up to them also.

731
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,435
You are a gifted girl
with immense promise...

732
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:04,813
and you should learn very early
that certain people can hold you back.

733
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:07,858
Grandpa, stop it.
You cannot treat Dean this way.

734
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:10,277
I'm sorry. Excuse me. I have to work.

735
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:11,862
Grandpa.

736
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,909
Thank you for the dinner
and the gift, Grandma...

737
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,578
but I really think we should be going.

738
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,246
Thanks.

739
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:23,790
I'm sorry.

740
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:33,759
Am I crazy?
That's supposed to be us, right?

741
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,519
Want to come in and have some dessert?
You never did get your Twinkie.

742
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,772
No, thanks. I think I should get going.

743
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:48,815
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

744
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:52,945
Okay, all I can say is, Dean, tonight
you officially became a Gilmore girl.

745
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:54,780
Feels good, huh?

746
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:57,866
- Yeah.
- See you later. Meet you inside.

747
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,789
I don't even know what to say.

748
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,249
It's no big deal.

749
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,752
I had no idea. I thought he would...

750
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:13,006
- I am so sorry, Dean.
- It's not your fault.

751
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,593
None of those things he said were true.
None of them mean anything.

752
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,470
I don't know what made him act that way.

753
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:21,682
Let's just forget it, all right?

754
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,351
- Please don't be upset.
- I'm not.

755
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:27,145
- Dean...
- I'm fine. I'm not upset.

756
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:32,234
I have to go.

757
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,822
- Call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

758
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,413
That man is impossible.

759
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,497
Twinkie?

760
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:47,666
He just attacks Dean out of nowhere...

761
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:51,920
and Dean is sitting there being
perfectly nice, and then all of a sudden...

762
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:55,716
- God, I'm so mad. He's a snob.
- Yes.

763
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:59,511
And he doesn't listen.
He just wants to say horrible things...

764
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:03,182
and have you sit there and listen to him
and then just agree with him.

765
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:04,391
What is that all about?

766
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:07,019
That is about a hundred years' worth
of inbreeding.

767
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:10,606
I've never seen him be mean before, ever.
Not like that.

768
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,816
I don't know
how I'll ever talk to him again.

769
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:15,986
And Dean, he must be so upset right now.

770
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,863
I hate that he did this to him.

771
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:22,034
Yes, it was bad.
My father was in fine form tonight. But...

772
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,370
- But? There's a 'but' from you?
- Twinkie?

773
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,750
I don't think my father has ever loved...

774
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,211
anything in this world
as much as he loves you.

775
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:35,297
Now, that having been established,
let's just consider...

776
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,926
that maybe this flip-out tonight
actually came from somewhere...

777
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:43,514
that possibly has nothing to do with Dean
and possibly has nothing to do with you.

778
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,682
What are you talking about?

779
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:49,353
You are the great white hope
of the Gilmore clan.

780
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:52,523
You are their angel sent from up above.

781
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,275
- You are the daughter they didn't have.
- Mom...

782
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,404
No, it's not a feel-sorry-for-me thing.
It's just the truth.

783
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:01,532
I mean, you're going to go to college.

784
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:04,660
Hell, you're going to graduate
from high school.

785
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:07,246
They'll get to watch you
walk down the aisle...

786
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:11,917
wearing your cap and gown
and get your diploma and go to Harvard...

787
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:16,630
and be a Phi Beta bimbo
and graduate with honors...

788
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:19,091
and just set the world on fire.

789
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:21,927
I mean, that is the plan.
Looks like it's going to happen.

790
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,762
It is going to happen.

791
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:26,932
Except for that 'Phi Beta bimbo' part.

792
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:30,811
But then tonight,
you walk in with this beautiful boy...

793
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:35,190
who likes you enough to brave going
to your grandparents' house for dinner...

794
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:38,986
and Dad looks at you
and sees you with him...

795
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:43,282
and all of a sudden,
has a terrible Lorelai flashback.

796
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:47,077
He sees it all going away,
the college, the cap and gown.

797
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,663
- I'm not going to get pregnant.
- I know that.

798
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:52,583
- He should know that.
- Yes. He should.

799
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:55,502
But... You do have my eyes.

800
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:58,338
You do realize you just spent 10 minutes
defending your dad?

801
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:01,758
I know. I'll have terrible nightmares
all night long.

802
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,678
But I'll tell you what,
if you cut him a little slack...

803
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:09,224
I'll wear my 'porn star'T-shirt
to dinner next week.

804
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:10,684
- Deal.
- Good.

805
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:16,148
Hello?

806
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,524
I just thought you should know.

807
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:21,236
My parents just brought in the suitcase
that I'm supposed to take on my trip.

808
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,781
To paint you a picture, it could fit
you and me, plus everything we own...

809
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:27,659
and still have enough room
to do a little souvenir shopping.

810
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,369
I am never coming back.

811
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:33,373
What is Lorelai thinking, letting Rory
run around with a boy like that?

812
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:36,460
Of course, she isn't thinking.
She never thinks.

813
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,837
Richard, please.
You're giving me a headache.

814
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,173
And what were you thinking,
inviting him over here?

815
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,967
We told her she could invite someone.
You were right there.

816
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,094
- I did not mean him.
- Please calm down.

817
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,597
I will not.
Did you hear the way she talked to me?

818
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,140
I heard the way she talked to you.

819
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,517
She sounded like her mother.

820
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,143
You were attacking her boyfriend.

821
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:55,187
A girl that age shouldn't have a boyfriend.

822
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,065
You truly think a 16-year-old girl
isn't going to date?

823
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:00,192
Of course she'll date, and she should date.

824
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,694
Proper socialization
is important to a child.

825
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:06,114
But she should not date one boy,
and she should not date him.

826
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:07,491
Don't answer that.

827
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:08,951
I'm going to answer it.

828
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:11,203
Emily, we are
in the middle of a discussion.

829
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:14,706
I'm sure you'll remember exactly
where you were five minutes from now.

830
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,209
- Hello?
- Hi. Mrs. Gilmore?

831
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,461
It's Sookie St. James, Lorelai's friend.

832
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,255
I don't know if you'd remember me.

833
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:23,006
Yes, you're the chef at the Inn.

834
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:26,760
That's right. I'm sorry to call
so late, but I need to ask a question.

835
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:29,847
I'm planning a surprise wedding shower
for Lorelai and Max.

836
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,598
It's going to be more like a big party.

837
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:35,227
I've cleared the date with everybody
around here, so we're all set to go...

838
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,688
but I wanted to make sure
you guys would be around...

839
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:41,733
before I finalized everything.
It's going to be Saturday the 21st.

840
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,737
I don't know. I'd have to check.

841
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:51,743
Okay. You check,
and then you call me at the Inn.

842
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,873
- Yes, I'll get back to you.
- Okay.

843
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,424
I want you to call Rory tomorrow
and apologize.

844
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,466
What?

845
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,845
I want you to tell her you're sorry,
that you weren't feeling well...

846
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:12,764
and you think Dean is a lovely boy
and he's welcome anytime.

847
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,892
Have you gone insane?
Under no circumstances...

848
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:17,269
Our daughter is getting married.

849
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:20,898
She's getting married,
and she didn't tell us.

850
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:24,568
When Rory decides to get married,
I'd like her to tell us.

851
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:27,613
Call her tomorrow.

852
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:40,459
- It was awful.
- It sounds awful.

853
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,294
That's the family you want to marry into.

854
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,671
- I must be insane.
- You must be.

855
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,926
- Speaking of marrying into...
- Yes?

856
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:52,721
...I have a little something for you.
- Let me guess.

857
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:55,432
Is it gum? Because you know
how much I like gum...

858
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:58,352
and how concerned I am
about dental hygiene.

859
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:02,481
Oh, my.

860
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:04,691
You like?

861
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,235
It's beautiful.

862
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,115
It's too big.

863
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:13,992
- No, it's not.
- Give it to me.

864
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:15,410
No, you can't have it back.

865
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,663
- I'll get it sized.
- No, it's okay.

866
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:18,705
It's going to fall off.

867
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,791
- I'll wear it on my thumb.
- You won't do that.

868
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,501
I'll eat a lot of salt and bloat up.

869
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:26,463
Just let me get it sized, and I promise
you'll never have to take it off again.

870
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:28,924
In fact, I'm going to insist on it.

871
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:41,019
- Just in a minute, okay?
- Okay.

872
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:55,742
I'm getting married.

873
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:41,371
