1
00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:02,267
Previously on
"Gilmore Girls"...

2
00:00:02,277 --> 00:00:04,273
- Hey.
- Look, it's Liz's new baby.

3
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:07,017
I've decided that April and I
are gonna move to New Mexico.

4
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:07,664
Really?

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,101
They've known each other
since freshman year.

6
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:11,886
I don't understand. You guys are
friends? You know each other?

7
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:14,358
She's my kid, all right?
She's our kid.

8
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:15,828
She's not just yours.

9
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:17,479
What is your problem
with a wedding?

10
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:19,090
- We're already married.
- So what's the big deal?

11
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:21,189
You planned a whole huge
wedding with that diner guy.

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,590
"That diner guy"?

13
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:24,668
The court only cares
what's best for April.

14
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,591
In these types of cases,

15
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:28,650
they almost always
side with the mother.

16
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:31,973
- She doesn't want to see you right now.
- Let me explain. Please.

17
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:02,960
The redcoats are coming!
The redcoats are coming!

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,411
The redcoats are coming!

19
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:06,753
Whoa, whoa.
Hold on there, missy.

20
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,891
Got to put on your
jacket first, okay?

21
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:12,132
- Hi!
- Hi!

22
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:14,450
- I'm so mad at you!
- What kind of greeting is that?

23
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:16,312
What kind of daughter doesn't let her
mother pick her up at the airport?

24
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:18,442
The kind of daughter who parks
her car at the airport car park.

25
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,633
But I'm the kind of mother who picks
her daughter up from the airport.

26
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:22,831
You know, with flowers and coffee
and a fake chauffeur's sign.

27
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,332
Why would you mess
with my sense of self?

28
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,251
But my car was parked at
the airport car park.

29
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:29,250
So what? I could have driven to the
airport, picked you up, brought you back.

30
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:31,580
Then we both could have driven to
pick up your car and come back here.

31
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:33,533
Yeah, 'cause that wouldn't be
a waste of gas or anything.

32
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:36,432
Oh. Oh, God.
Did you pack Big Ben?

33
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:37,930
I still think it
was kind of risky.

34
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:38,660
What's risky?

35
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:40,211
You've spent a lot of
time across the pond.

36
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:43,290
You might get confused and forget
which side of the road to drive on.

37
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:45,012
Yes, it was a near escape.

38
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:46,820
Hey! Welcome home!

39
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,390
The redcoat is here!

40
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,800
Hi, dad!

41
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:51,450
- How are you doing?
- Good.

42
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:52,922
Hi, little sister.

43
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:55,230
Oh, hello. Okay. Oh.

44
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:57,102
Oh. Well, all right.

45
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:59,752
- So, you made it here okay?
- Yeah.

46
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,491
I was thinking --
all that time in England,

47
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:03,593
you might forget which side
of the road to drive on.

48
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,012
Hey, don't steal my material.

49
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:05,922
What do you mean,
your material?

50
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:06,903
I just made that joke.

51
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,792
The drive-on-the-other-side-
of-the-road thing? That's my joke.

52
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:10,410
If you just made it,
you ripped me off.

53
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:12,192
- I ripped you off?
- Guys.

54
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:15,390
That's like saying Lenny
Bruce rips off Carrot Top

55
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:17,513
or Woody Allen gets his material
from what's his name --

56
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:18,703
the guy with the watermelons.

57
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,833
I did not rip you off --
no way, no how, sister.

58
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:24,091
I made that joke this morning at
breakfast. We were sitting there.

59
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,220
- We were drinking coffee.
- Guys...

60
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:27,390
not that that's not
a hilarious joke,

61
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,000
but the guy at the car
park made the same one.

62
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:32,111
Hey, G.G., would you want
to take this inside for me?

63
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,601
Come on, Geege.

64
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,480
- Ohh!
- What?

65
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:38,043
You took the
Christmas lights down.

66
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,441
I didn't take them down.
I haven't put them up yet.

67
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:40,800
I saved Christmas for you.

68
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:43,292
Before you left, we said we were
gonna wait and do Christmas together.

69
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:44,863
Okay, yeah, but --

70
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,171
What are those?

71
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:47,610
What are what?

72
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:49,403
Are those a Christmas
present from Logan?

73
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,223
No, I mean -- well, yeah,

74
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,910
but it's more like a late
birthday/new year's present.

75
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:54,901
Stop sniffing me.

76
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,262
I smell Christmas cookies.

77
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:58,661
There's no way you can smell
cookies from six days ago.

78
00:02:58,677 --> 00:02:59,881
So there were
Christmas cookies.

79
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,181
There may have been
a little Christmas.

80
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:02,321
Unbelievable!

81
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:04,820
London, as a city,
is very Christmas-obsessed, okay?

82
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,911
I couldn't help what
was going on around me.

83
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,352
But inside, I assure you,

84
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:10,553
I was devoid of the Christmas spirit --
a complete scrooge.

85
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:12,223
I didn't let any
Christmas happen.

86
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:14,832
I grinched it up so hard,
I didn't let it snow.

87
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,203
What? It hasn't snowed yet?

88
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:18,650
Thanks to me thinking of you and
our agreement, our pledge, our oath.

89
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:19,722
You stopped the snow?

90
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:21,823
Yes, sheer force of will.

91
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:24,550
We said we would have no Christmas,
so I had no Christmas.

92
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:26,052
You must have had
a little Christmas.

93
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:26,891
None.

94
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,260
- No presents?
- No presents.

95
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,210
- No tree?
- No tree.

96
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:31,141
- No eggnog?
- No egg, no nog.

97
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:33,541
I sat in the dark with the
lights off and ate gruel.

98
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:36,591
Okay, mom, I hereby apologize

99
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:39,010
for any accidental Christmas
celebrating I may have done.

100
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm now ready to celebrate
Christmas for real.

101
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:41,682
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

102
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:42,753
Okay!

103
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:44,972
So, you stopped the snow?

104
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,463
Yeah. I did an anti-snow dance.

105
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,280
It was humiliating and arduous,
but I had made a promise to my daughter.

106
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,581
- Humiliating?
- Two words -- coconut bra.

107
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,452
- Where am I taking this?
- Living room.

108
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,452
- I love our trees!
- Me too!

109
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:52,262
- You don't think our trees are...
- What?

110
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:54,441
- Maybe a little homely?
- Homely?!

111
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:55,841
- I'm just saying.
- What?

112
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:56,660
What are you saying?

113
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:59,311
That our trees are not classically
good-looking. If you were to look up "tree"

114
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:01,450
in the dictionary,
you would not find one of these fellas.

115
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:03,021
Why would you look up
"tree" in the dictionary?

116
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,761
So we don't have classically
good-looking trees.

117
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:05,911
You don't know what a tree is?

118
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,753
- Come on, look at that tree.
- I'm looking.

119
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,263
- That tree has character.
- It does.

120
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,631
That tree has earned
character by persevering

121
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:15,360
through freezing winters
and forest fires and floods.

122
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,282
This tree's a fighter.

123
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,861
Woodpeckers. Maniacal woodpeckers
just pecking at its trunk.

124
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,661
Survivor.

125
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:20,980
Peck, peck, peck,
day in and day out.

126
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:22,571
That tree's a champion.

127
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,473
It smells so good in
here with all our trees.

128
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:26,371
It's like a dozen
car air fresheners.

129
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:29,312
Just imagine how good it's gonna be 
once all of our trees are in here.

130
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:30,421
This is crazy!

131
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,481
- Seven trees.
- Which was crazy.

132
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:33,930
What? Buck a tree.

133
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,570
Dad, we have to have at least
one tree in the kitchen.

134
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:37,883
Yeah, dad.

135
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:40,163
I'm in a forest of crazy.

136
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,433
- Buck a tree.
- Genius.

137
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:45,230
So genius. We better be careful,
or word will get out

138
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,382
and everyone will start celebrating
Christmas after Christmas,

139
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,343
which will really drive up the
post-Christmas Christmas-tree prices.

140
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,272
Then we'll have to keep
celebrating later and later.

141
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:55,283
Yeah, before we know it,
we'll be having figgy pudding in july.

142
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:57,383
Look! G.G.!

143
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,850
You know who made this? Rory.

144
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:01,959
Rory made this when she
was right about your age.

145
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,190
That's nice.

146
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:04,288
Someone's not impressed.

147
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:06,290
She doesn't understand
abstract art.

148
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:07,152
Philistine.

149
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,520
Hey, look at this.
Here's Santa's costume.

150
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,831
Wow. That's seen better days.

151
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:13,871
Why do you have
Santa's clothes?

152
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:17,083
Because... I...
used to do Santa's dry cleaning.

153
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:18,582
- You did?
- Yeah.

154
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:20,171
- Wow.
- I know.

155
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:22,021
Okay, everybody can relax.

156
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:24,541
There's now a Christmas
tree in the kitchen.

157
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:25,390
Thank you.

158
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:27,521
Oh! My antlers!
I love my antlers!

159
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:28,923
Oh, neat!

160
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,761
Let me try!

161
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:33,571
On Vixen! On Blinxen !

162
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:36,171
Kid took my antlers. She took my
antlers and she galloped away.

163
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,051
All right,
now tell me more about London.

164
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,840
Did everything work out
with Logan after the whole

165
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:41,581
Marty/Lucy/dinner debacle?

166
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,543
Well, I was pretty
angry for a while,

167
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:46,173
especially after he blurted out
all that stuff the way he did,

168
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:48,640
but he apologized a lot

169
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:51,603
and even admitted that he was a
little jealous, so I forgave him.

170
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:52,712
Well, that's good.

171
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:55,132
Yeah. Well, plus I realized
a lot of it was my fault.

172
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,410
You know, I was Lucy's friend.

173
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,633
I should have been straight
with her about knowing Marty.

174
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,662
I just can't believe I got suckered
into that whole thing for so long.

175
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,313
I don't blame her
for hating me.

176
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:05,951
So have you talked to her now?

177
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,222
I've left messages.

178
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:08,333
Oh, hon.

179
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:10,320
Wow! Look at all this!

180
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,443
Yeah, we have a lot
of Christmas stuff.

181
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,061
Cool. Mistletoe.

182
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:16,141
Where are you going with that?

183
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:17,263
I'm gonna hang it
up in the doorway.

184
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:18,662
Oh, that's not where it goes.

185
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:19,452
Where does it go?

186
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:21,940
We tape it to one of the blades
of the ceiling fan upstairs.

187
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:23,792
That way,
the kissing is more like a sport.

188
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:24,722
One of our traditions.

189
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,842
That's a tradition?

190
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:27,473
Our traditions are
very important to us.

191
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,462
What other traditions 
am I in for?

192
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:32,502
On Christmas morning, we put red
and green M&M's in our cereal.

193
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,480
Down with that.

194
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:35,490
We string up our
stockings on the banister.

195
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:38,931
Yes, we used to string them up on the
traditional place of the fireplace,

196
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:42,082
but then there was that fire incident,
and they nearly burned to bits.

197
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:44,712
So now we put them on little
nails on the banister.

198
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:47,802
Oh, we always go to Weston's for a
cup of holiday candy-cane coffee,

199
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:49,131
which is so delicious.

200
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:51,482
Delicious. And we bake cookies.

201
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:52,561
You bake?

202
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,842
Well, we put on some Christmas music,
drink eggnog,

203
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:57,292
and pretend to bake the cookies
we actually bought from Weston's.

204
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,193
We do, however,
make our own frosting.

205
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:01,833
We use a handheld electric
mixer from the dark ages

206
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:04,571
so that Rory can continue the
tradition of licking the beaters.

207
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:06,811
Yes, a skill which I have
perfected over the years.

208
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:09,971
And then on Christmas Eve, we leave
the cookies out for Santa's reindeer.

209
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:11,120
Santa prefers gum.

210
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,150
Well, I am very excited
about these traditions,

211
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:16,151
but, you know, because it's our
first Christmas together as a family,

212
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,611
I thought maybe it was time
to start some new traditions.

213
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:19,833
Like what?

214
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:21,482
Well, for starters...

215
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:23,911
I got us these.

216
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:24,790
Wow.

217
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,672
Oh, they're so big and flashy.

218
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:27,912
I got one for each of us.

219
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:30,703
But we have stockings already.

220
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:33,410
I mean,
they're a little singed from the fire,

221
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:34,752
but they're still usable.

222
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,730
But not stockings like these.

223
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:38,022
That's true.

224
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:40,253
All right, this will be a new tradition.
I'm gonna hang them up.

225
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,510
You know what else we should do?
We should go caroling.

226
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:43,900
- No.
- Are you kidding?

227
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,280
Come on, it'll be fun.

228
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:48,320
It wouldn't be fun for
strangers to hear us sing.

229
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:50,213
- It'd be cruel, that's what it would be.
- And embarrassing.

230
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,201
Guys, carols are beautiful.

231
00:08:52,218 --> 00:08:55,171
# Glo-o-o-o-o-o #

232
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:57,442
# o-o-o-o-o #

233
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,152
# o-o-o-o-oria #

234
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:06,353
# In excelsis deo #

235
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,852
Yes, sir. Thank you.

236
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:16,422
Oh. You.

237
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:18,153
I thought we were
done with you.

238
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,242
Hi, Michel. Is Lorelai here?

239
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:25,040
Hey. Can you tell
Lorelai that...

240
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:27,700
someone is here to see her?

241
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,622
Well, this is awfully awkward.

242
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:38,393
We should make some
sort of conversation.

243
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:43,020
I see your sense of
style has not changed.

244
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:43,770
Nope.

245
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:48,432
I've often wondered, does someone in
your family own a flannel company?

246
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:49,833
Uh, no.

247
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:54,062
You know what?
I cannot do this.

248
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:57,393
Let us just stand here and let
the awkwardness wash over us.

249
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:58,700
Fine by me.

250
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,532
- Hi.
- Ahh, here she is.

251
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:06,693
It's been a delight
chatting with you.

252
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,333
- I'm sorry to just barge in like this.
- That's okay.

253
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:10,791
Can we talk somewhere?

254
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:12,293
Um, sure.

255
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:19,800
Anna wants to move to
New Mexico with April.

256
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:20,800
New Mexico?

257
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:24,803
Anna's mother just had major surgery,
and she's not doing so well.

258
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:26,980
And Anna wants to be near her,
which I get.

259
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:31,620
It's just I'd like to see April
on some weekends and vacations.

260
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:33,341
- Of course.
- But Anna says no.

261
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:37,001
In fact, right now,
she's not letting me see April at all,

262
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:39,722
so I have to fight for custody,

263
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:41,643
and I'm going to court.

264
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:43,802
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's the whole thing.

265
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:46,732
I got to get a lawyer and wear a tie.
It's not a whole lot of fun.

266
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,180
It's good you're
doing it, though.

267
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:51,793
Well, I can't not.
You know, I mean, I can't not do it.

268
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:52,760
Right.

269
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:57,481
So, anyway, um,
the court date is coming up.

270
00:10:57,498 --> 00:11:00,390
And I need a
character reference.

271
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:03,722
And Liz wrote one, but my lawyer
read it, and he said it was sweet,

272
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:07,181
but it was filled with all
these weird childhood anecdotes

273
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:11,293
that I probably don't want to share
with anyone, much less a court of law.

274
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:14,081
And I need another one,
and I just don't know who to go to.

275
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:16,911
And I know it's an
awful lot to ask.

276
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,390
And if it's weird or whatever,
I mean, I totally understand.

277
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,403
Yes.

278
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,433
But if you could, uh...

279
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:24,102
Yes, I'll do it.

280
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:25,531
Yeah?

281
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:29,750
Okay. All right, well,
this is my lawyer's address,

282
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:32,672
and you can just mail the
letter directly to him.

283
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:33,563
- Okay.
- Yeah.

284
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:37,103
And, look, if you don't mind, if you
could do it as soon as possible...

285
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:38,953
The court date's right
around the corner.

286
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:40,751
- Definitely.
- Thanks. Thank you.

287
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:43,131
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

288
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,610
Okay, well... I'll just...

289
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:48,793
- Thanks.
- Sure. I'll get right on it.

290
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:51,082
- I send it to here. Okay.
- All right.

291
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:52,221
Thanks.

292
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:53,781
Okay.

293
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:09,003
No, that should do it. Thanks.

294
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,652
- Ugh!
- It's hard, huh?

295
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:13,071
Yeah, the pressure is a lot,
you know?

296
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:14,081
Yeah, of course.

297
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:16,572
I mean, I just keep thinking that
whatever I write might help save

298
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:19,091
Luke's relationship with his kid,
which is huge and important,

299
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:22,482
so the pressure's really getting to me
-- that and a lack of sufficient caffeine.

300
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:25,142
Of course. Totally.
Plus, it's Luke,

301
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:27,613
and after all you've been through,
it's got to be hard.

302
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,723
Well, yeah.

303
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:31,742
You're having to dig up
all those feelings for him.

304
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:34,361
That can't be fun.
You must be feeling overwhelmed.

305
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:37,111
I don't think it's about
digging up my feelings for Luke.

306
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:37,730
Okay.

307
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,783
I think it's really about
writing an amazing letter.

308
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:41,420
I mean, the stakes
are really high for him,

309
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:45,360
and I want it to be something
amazing and powerful,

310
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,601
you know,
like Gettysburg address powerful

311
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:49,662
or "I have a dream" powerful.

312
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:52,213
So, I'm thinking I'll look
a couple of those up online

313
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:55,231
and just pop the name "Luke"
in there and be done with it.

314
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:56,762
Sure. I don't think
anyone will notice.

315
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:57,923
All right, back to work.

316
00:12:57,938 --> 00:12:59,212
Good luck.

317
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:37,503
Is it twins?
It's got to be twins.

318
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,120
- Is what twins?
- Are you...

319
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:40,882
Pregnant? You
think I'm pregnant?

320
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:43,801
Oh yeah, because it's not acceptable in
this society to be a plus-sized woman

321
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:45,532
who happens to carry
her weight in her belly.

322
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,472
So you're not -- oh, gee.

323
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:50,390
Well, I need new glasses.
I'm sorry.

324
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,782
Of course I'm pregnant.
Turkey with swiss.

325
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:57,982
Hey! Hey!
What's up with this tip?

326
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,162
Oh, I'm... sorry.

327
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:01,612
This is 50%.
I don't need your pity tips.

328
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:04,382
Okay, I'm pregnant,
not homeless.

329
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,732
April! Hey!

330
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:09,203
Wow. What are you doing?

331
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:12,080
Well, I biked over because --
oh, my gosh. Lane is gigantic.

332
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:13,502
I wouldn't mention
that to Lane.

333
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:16,501
Hey, did you know the gestation
period for an elephant is 22 months?

334
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:18,860
I wouldn't mention that to Lane, either.
So what do you doing here?

335
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:20,250
Does your mother
know you're here?

336
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:21,701
She doesn't have a clue.

337
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:24,090
You see, I told her I was
gonna spend the whole day

338
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:27,002
at the Boston museum of science
with my friend Melissa and her dad.

339
00:14:27,018 --> 00:14:30,183
And it's perfect because mom confirmed
things with Melissa's dad two days ago.

340
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:33,553
But, then yesterday, I told 
Melissa's dad that I couldn't come

341
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,223
because I had gotten the curse,

342
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:38,740
which is perfect, 'cause you know how
awkward men get about menstruation.

343
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,811
Yeah, look, it's really great to
see you, but this isn't gonna work.

344
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,500
There's no way mom will
ever figure it out.

345
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:46,152
I even read all about cotton-topped
tamarin monkeys they have there

346
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:49,652
and the Van de Graaff generator, so I'll
have plenty to tell her when I get back.

347
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,193
I'm gonna have to
take you home.

348
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,450
- No!
- I'm sorry.

349
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:54,690
Dad, no. Please, no.
I've missed you so much.

350
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,001
I missed you, too.

351
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:57,620
I haven't seen you
in ages and ages.

352
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,702
Plus, if you take me home now,
mom will know that I lied,

353
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:02,760
and I'll get into
so much trouble.

354
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,782
- Please?
- I don't know.

355
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:06,552
Here. This is for you.

356
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,572
Merry belated Christmas.
Sorry it looks like this.

357
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,500
I couldn't exactly wrap
it in wrapping paper

358
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:12,572
without arousing
maternal suspicions,

359
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:13,823
if you know what I mean.

360
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:16,462
Thanks. I actually got
you something, too.

361
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:17,383
You did?

362
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:18,580
Yeah.

363
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:21,670
So, are you hungry or what?

364
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:22,833
Tuna-fish sandwiches?

365
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:24,283
That's what I was
thinking, too.

366
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:26,510
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

367
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,842
Be very careful
with your needle.

368
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:30,662
I know.

369
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:32,770
Okay, because it's really,
really pointy.

370
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:33,803
I know.

371
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,582
Okay, so what guidelines
did he give you?

372
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:37,791
None. No guidelines.
No guidelines whatsoever.

373
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,343
I'm supposed to write
a character reference,

374
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,472
so I thought I'd
reference his character.

375
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:42,631
Sounds like you're
on the right track.

376
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,921
No, I'm not,
because it turns out I can't write.

377
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:46,863
- Oh, sure, you can.
- No, I can't.

378
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:50,430
I stare at the blank page,
and I just keep staring and staring.

379
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,683
And eventually I have to get
up and lubricate my eyeballs.

380
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:55,013
Otherwise, they would fall
out of my head, like raisins.

381
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:57,472
Well, are you using a pen?
You can't just stare at the paper.

382
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:59,510
You have to have a writing
implement of some kind.

383
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:00,573
Look.

384
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,770
- Very pretty, honey.
- What a good job.

385
00:16:02,788 --> 00:16:05,182
You know what I really like?
Your cranberry-to-popcorn ratio.

386
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,801
Rory's more of a one-to-one kind of gal,
but I'm like you.

387
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:10,211
I like a lot of cranberry,
little popcorn for flair.

388
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:11,731
- Yours is pretty, too.
- Thank you.

389
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:13,530
I have a writing implement.
The problem is

390
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:15,770
that everything I write
sounds so schmucky.

391
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:17,951
I'm sure that's not true.
We're running low on cranberries.

392
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:22,222
"Luke Danes is a highly regarded
member of this community.

393
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:25,693
Not an ill word can be
spoken of Mr. Danes."

394
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:29,130
It's like I'm some documentary
narrator from the history channel.

395
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:31,583
And you know what phrase
I keep using? "Stand-up."

396
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:33,930
"Luke Danes is a stand-up guy.

397
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:36,671
He's an upstanding
member of Stars Hollow,

398
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:38,503
a real stand-up citizen."

399
00:16:38,518 --> 00:16:40,173
People are gonna think he's
turned into a comedian.

400
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,713
Sounds like you're
overthinking this.

401
00:16:41,728 --> 00:16:43,262
Maybe if you just
put pen to paper.

402
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,450
I tried that. I thought, "I'll just
sit down and write whatever comes --

403
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,190
no judgment, no inner critic."

404
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,061
- Was that a bad idea.
- Really? Why?

405
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,951
Because my brain is a wild
jungle full of scary gibberish.

406
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:55,271
"I'm writing a letter.
I can't write a letter.

407
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,343
Why can't I write a letter?
I'm wearing a green dress.

408
00:16:57,377 --> 00:16:59,961
I wish I was wearing my blue dress.
My blue dress is at the cleaners.

409
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:03,530
'The germans wore gray. You wore blue.'
'Casablanca' is such a good movie.

410
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:05,132
'Casablanca.' The
white house. Bush.

411
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,653
Why don't I drive a hybrid car?
I should drive a hybrid car.

412
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,530
I should really take my bicycle to work.
Bicycle. Unicycle. Unitard.

413
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:13,533
Hockey puck. Rattlesnake.
Monkey, monkey, underpants."

414
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:15,883
"Hockey puck, rattlesnake,
monkey, monkey, underpants"?

415
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:17,610
Exactly. That's
what I'm saying.

416
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,143
It's a big bag of
weird in there.

417
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,303
So, I think I need inspiration.

418
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:23,870
I need a muse.
Perhaps I need "the muse."

419
00:17:23,885 --> 00:17:26,150
Maybe it would help if Sharon
Stone would appear to me

420
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:28,750
in an alarming caftan and coo
inspirational words in my ear.

421
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,723
Just write what you feel.
That's all writing is.

422
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,380
Hey, do you think there
might be some reason

423
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,651
why you're having
trouble with this?

424
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,391
I would imagine that writing
about Luke wouldn't be easy.

425
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,362
- I know. You should write it.
- What? No.

426
00:17:38,378 --> 00:17:41,941
Yes. You are a wonderful writer.
Everything you write is so good.

427
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:44,381
Your grocery lists are
like shimmering haikus.

428
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,090
You write a pretty mean
grocery list yourself.

429
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,681
And it doesn't have to shimmer.
It just has to be authentic and real.

430
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:49,892
Oh! You know what I'm gonna do?

431
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:50,901
Write my thing for me.

432
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:53,270
No, I'm going to
write a letter to Lucy

433
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:55,992
explaining how sorry I am.
That way, she doesn't have to see me,

434
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:57,890
and she can just read it
and she'll still know.

435
00:17:57,906 --> 00:18:01,092
That's great. And after you do that,
you can write my letter for me.

436
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:03,371
No. This is something you
have to write for yourself.

437
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:05,632
- What letter?
- Uh... to Santa.

438
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:06,601
Wow.

439
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,951
You know what my problem is?

440
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:10,550
It's the whole
writing-by-hand thing.

441
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:14,252
You know? I think what would help is if
I got my old electric typewriter out.

442
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,461
The soothing sound of
that irritating buzzing,

443
00:18:16,476 --> 00:18:18,323
- that's what would help me.
- I'm home!

444
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:22,622
So, cranberries really stay on the
string, and popcorn falls right off.

445
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,101
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, everybody.

446
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:25,240
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, dad.

447
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:26,622
- Hey.
- Hey.

448
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:29,350
Wow. Look at those.

449
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:30,732
They're for the trees.

450
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:31,773
So, what do you
have in the bag?

451
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:34,170
No snooping.
This is Santa's secret stuff.

452
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:36,403
- Lorelai knows Santa.
- Oh, yeah?

453
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,411
She does Santa's dry cleaning.

454
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:41,701
Well, Lorelai is a
remarkable woman.

455
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:01,391
- The yellow squash?
- Yes, they're a delicacy.

456
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,062
We're going to steam them
along with the broccoli.

457
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:05,110
Is that adult broccoli?
Can you do that with baby squash?

458
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:06,921
Yes, it's very
high in oxidants.

459
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:08,190
- Welcome home, babe.
- Welcome home, Lane.

460
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:10,591
So we went to the nature mart,
and guess what we got you.

461
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,352
Turnip greens -- turns out they
got a sick amount of folic acid.

462
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:16,181
What else did we get?
Squash, zucchini, tofu.

463
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,892
Special calcium fortified tofu.

464
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:19,752
And the calcium's real important
because you're not eating

465
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:22,812
some of your previous calcium sources,
like soft cheese.

466
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,313
You're not eating soft cheese,
are you?

467
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:26,810
No. I'm not having
any soft cheese.

468
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:28,571
- And no sushi?
- And no duck.

469
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,090
We don't want the babies
to have webbed feet.

470
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:33,240
So the duck sushi I had for lunch
was probably a mistake, huh?

471
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,223
I'm kidding, mama.

472
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:36,853
I am beat.

473
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:39,472
Today at work,
it was absolutely ridiculous.

474
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:42,581
Every other customer was "baby" crazy!
I'm gonna tell Luke tomorrow.

475
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:44,330
- You should put your feet up.
- I'm fine.

476
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,251
- How are your ankles?
- They're fine.

477
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:48,551
You know what I was reading about?
Compression pantyhose.

478
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:51,031
A lot of pregnant women wear
them to help with circulation.

479
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:53,700
How are your bladder? Are the babies
putting a lot of pressure on your bladder?

480
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:54,781
What? I don't know.

481
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,743
How many times did
you urinate today?

482
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:59,202
Oh, my god, Zach!
I am so not answering that question!

483
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:01,382
Here are some new prenatal
vitamins we bought you.

484
00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:03,733
I'm going to put them
on your bedside table.

485
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,582
You have to take two every
morning the moment you wake up.

486
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,370
Maybe I need to
make you a chart.

487
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:10,042
I don't need a chart.

488
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:13,002
I happen to know that you forgot
to take your calcium tablets

489
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:14,320
for two mornings.

490
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,811
That is not right, Lane.

491
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,081
Mama, you're counting my pills?

492
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,633
Yes, of course.

493
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:28,122
I'm serious about the whole
compression-pantyhose thing.

494
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:29,882
I could totally
pick you up a pair.

495
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,352
I mean, do I relish the prospect of being
seen skulking around the pantyhose aisle?

496
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,792
No. But I'm sure you
don't want varicose veins.

497
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:38,551
- I don't want pantyhose!
- Oh. Okay.

498
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:41,571
I have decided I will make a chart.
I need a piece of paper,

499
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,401
a ruler,
and some magic markers.

500
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:45,340
I'm serious, mama.
I don't need --

501
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:48,431
- What is that?
- Oh, it's the crib we ordered.

502
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,451
Isn't it cool?
It'll be big enough for both of them.

503
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:51,660
Where are my drums?

504
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:53,832
They're good, they're safe.
We put them in the closet.

505
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,523
The closet?
You put my drum kit in the closet?

506
00:20:56,536 --> 00:21:00,582
Yeah, we needed the space, and, Lane,
we haven't had band practice for months.

507
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:08,411
We need to have band practice!

508
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:10,080
Sure. And we will.

509
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:10,721
Now.

510
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:13,153
Well, if you want,
we can call Gil and Brian,

511
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:15,442
but I mean, can you even play?

512
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,932
What do you mean, can I play?

513
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:20,161
I mean, in your condition.

514
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:21,612
I can play.

515
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,882
Okay.

516
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,333
Cool.

517
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:32,530
I melted three entire candy canes into
this not-very-large cup of coffee,

518
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:34,650
- and still I can barely taste it.
- I know.

519
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,740
It's just the vaguest
whisper of peppermint.

520
00:21:36,757 --> 00:21:37,602
Peppermint.

521
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:40,910
I swear, I could get the same
effect if I put vaporub on my chest

522
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,130
and drank coffee
at the same time.

523
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:42,923
Peppermint.

524
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,702
I mean, how arbitrary is it to decide
to stop serving candy-cane coffee

525
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:48,471
the day after Christmas?

526
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:50,903
Christmas spirit is not
something that can be turned off

527
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,102
like a faucet on december 26th.

528
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:54,190
Yeah, it stinks.

529
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:57,502
On the plus side, any chest congestion
I had is now totally cleared up.

530
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,292
Well, that's good.

531
00:21:58,305 --> 00:21:59,812
Well, let's
go Christmas-shopping.

532
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:01,903
- Write your letter.
- I can't. I need a treat.

533
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:04,550
This was your treat. Coming to Weston's
was supposed to buck up your spirits.

534
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:05,803
and inspire your writing.

535
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:08,763
No, candy-cane coffee was
supposed to be my treat.

536
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:10,472
This coffee is no treat.

537
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:12,941
Let's face it --
this is un-candy-cane-coffee coffee,

538
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:14,553
and it's totally
un-bucking up my spirits.

539
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:15,892
So it's decided --
let's go shopping.

540
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:17,111
Write.

541
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,003
Rory, I can't.

542
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:21,192
Ooh. I have an idea. Excuse me.

543
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,070
Hi. Merry Christmas.

544
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:24,131
Christmas is over.

545
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:25,553
Okay. Sue -- pretty name.

546
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:29,270
I have a hunch that there's some of
the secret candy-cane-coffee mix

547
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:30,933
just sitting in the back there,

548
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:33,033
and I wonder if I could
make it worth your while

549
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:35,170
if you and I could come to
some sort of arrangement.

550
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:38,821
Like I said before, we stop selling
candy-cane coffee when Christmas is over.

551
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:40,942
Right. I'm not talking
about selling it.

552
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:44,163
I'm talking about maybe if you
misplaced a canister or two.

553
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:46,700
- Misplaced?
- Misplaced.

554
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:48,353
- Honey.
- Yes?

555
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,563
- Christmas is over.
- Okay.

556
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,613
- Are we gonna talk about this?
- About what?

557
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:56,983
- Why are you lying to dad?
- I'm not lying.

558
00:22:56,997 --> 00:22:59,440
He walked into the kitchen earlier,
and you all of a sudden

559
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:02,280
started prattling on about
popcorn and cranberries.

560
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,590
I wasn't prattling.
Come on, let's blow this popsicle stand.

561
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:10,333
But you're not telling him about this
character-reference thing, are you?

562
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:12,172
- I haven't yet.
- And you're not planning to.

563
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:15,620
You're intentionally not telling him.
That's kind of a lie of omission.

564
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:18,223
A Lie of Omission ? Isn't that an
Ashley Judd/Morgan Freeman movie?

565
00:23:18,256 --> 00:23:21,103
Look mom, if there's anything to be
learned from this whole thing with Lucy,

566
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:22,982
it's that honesty
is the best policy.

567
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:24,622
It's an okay policy.

568
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,313
But how do you expect to have
any kind of relationship

569
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:27,710
if you're not honest with him?

570
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:30,372
Honey, look,
I have been around a long time, okay?

571
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:32,141
I wore leggings the last
time they were trendy.

572
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,740
I knew Tom Hanks when he was a bosom
buddy. I have lived, and I have learned.

573
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:35,373
I know.

574
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:38,460
And I understand that you value honesty,
and I applaud that value.

575
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:41,260
But sometimes the truth is
a little more complicated.

576
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:42,552
More complicated how?

577
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:45,101
More complicated.
We don't have to talk about this.

578
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:47,953
I know, but I want you to
tell me what's going on.

579
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:51,143
Things with dad are great.
They're better than great.

580
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:52,873
It's just that...

581
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:53,723
What?

582
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:56,142
He's been a bit on
edge about Luke.

583
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:58,310
You know, I ran into Luke
outside Doose's the other day,

584
00:23:58,346 --> 00:24:00,991
and dad saw me
holding Liz's baby.

585
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,222
And it just wasn't great.
It wasn't great timing.

586
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:08,290
And this whole mom having the
not-a-wedding-party thing caused tension,

587
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:09,562
and we argued.

588
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,902
So I just want to be
sensitive and not worry him

589
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,690
about something he doesn't
need to worry about.

590
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:15,042
Well, that makes sense.

591
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:18,032
But everything is
gonna be fine.

592
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:19,643
Better than fine --
it's gonna be great.

593
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:20,690
Okay.

594
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:23,651
Well, you know, mom,
I've been around for a while, too.

595
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,210
I remember Tom Hanks from his
"Joe versus the volcano" days.

596
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,393
Yeah, you were like 5.

597
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,323
Yeah, but the point is,
I'm not a kid anymore.

598
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,953
You don't have to create this
whole Christmas illusion

599
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:34,533
where everything in the
world is magical and fine.

600
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:36,063
It's okay if it's not.

601
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:37,900
You still believe in Santa,
though, right?

602
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,161
Your best dry-cleaning client?
Of course.

603
00:24:41,755 --> 00:24:45,823
A little to the right. Okay. Too far.
A little to the left. There.

604
00:24:45,837 --> 00:24:46,861
- How's that?
- Good.

605
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,112
It really livens
up your apartment.

606
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:50,742
It's a very lively mask.
Thanks again, April.

607
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:52,221
I love it. I really do.

608
00:24:52,235 --> 00:24:53,763
It's based on my real face.

609
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:54,632
Oh, yeah?

610
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:56,453
Not the outside,
but the inside.

611
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:59,270
I made it in art class, and I had
to lie still with straws up my nose

612
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:01,081
while a partner put
plaster strips on my face.

613
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:03,562
- Straws on your nose, huh?
- I suffer for my art.

614
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:06,480
Anyway, this kid Evan,
he got Liz Alderman as a partner,

615
00:25:06,498 --> 00:25:09,880
who's a total wild child. And she laid
the plaster strips all willy-nilly

616
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:12,091
and ended up pulling
off half his eyebrows.

617
00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:13,531
Oh, that's not good.

618
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,760
Actually, Liz Alderman's
on my swim team now.

619
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:16,732
Oh yeah?

620
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:19,231
She's got these really huge feet,
which coach Bennett finds promising.

621
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,150
- Like built-in flippers.
- Exactly.

622
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:24,132
Hopefully they kick in -- no pun intended
-- before our big swim meet in may.

623
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:26,302
- May, huh?
- May 15th.

624
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:29,060
10 different clubs are sending teams.
It's gonna be amazing.

625
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:31,672
I hear they have really great
swim teams in New Mexico.

626
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:35,243
Yeah, right.
New Mexico is a barren, dusty desert,

627
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:37,490
and they probably don't
even have water to swim in.

628
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:40,321
In hot climates,
they actually have more swimming pools.

629
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:42,651
I bet you a lot of kids there
will be really into swimming.

630
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:44,120
Then they're probably
too good for me.

631
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:45,943
I mean, the only reason I
get to do so many events

632
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,030
is 'cause everyone on my
team stinks worse than I do.

633
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:49,591
- April!
- It's true.

634
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:50,993
Go on.

635
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:54,261
All right, go ahead and open
up your Christmas present.

636
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:57,550
Are you trying to bribe me out of a bad
mood with the offer of material goods?

637
00:25:57,566 --> 00:25:59,292
'Cause I'm amenable to that.

638
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:07,241
Wow! A rock polisher!

639
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:09,111
- Thanks so much.
- You like it?

640
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:11,742
- It's the perfect present.
- You hinted at it pretty hard,

641
00:26:11,756 --> 00:26:13,212
so I figured it might
be the right thing.

642
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:14,972
It is. It is.

643
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:19,191
But, dad, I kind of already got
a rock polisher from grandma.

644
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:21,390
Oh. Well,
then it's not the perfect present.

645
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:22,580
No, it is. It is.

646
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:24,923
This one looks more powerful
than the one I already have.

647
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:27,061
Plus, I mean,
who couldn't use two rock polishers?

648
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:28,210
- Yeah?
- Sure.

649
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:29,760
You should see my rock
collection right now.

650
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,575
It's insane. I've practically
got a quarry in my bedroom --

651
00:26:32,587 --> 00:26:36,721
granite, of course, but also feldspar,
quartz, mica, limestone.

652
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:38,110
- Cool.
- I know.

653
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:41,192
I've been biking over to Beacon Falls and
going rock-hunting around Naugatuck River.

654
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,391
It's amazing.

655
00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:44,910
The other day, I found an arrowhead
in almost perfect condition.

656
00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:47,790
It's so sharp, I think I'd get in
trouble if I brought it to school.

657
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,340
You know, if you're interested
in arrowheads, New Mexico has

658
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:52,161
- some incredible places --
- Dad.

659
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:54,190
Okay. Okay.

660
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:56,833
Let's open this thing.

661
00:26:58,568 --> 00:27:00,391
Hey! I'm done with the lights.

662
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:02,553
Do you want to see them now,
or you want to wait till after dark?

663
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:05,913
Uh, I will wait --
to get the full effect.

664
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:07,212
What you got there?

665
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,241
Uh, nothing.
Just some of Santa's secret stuff.

666
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:11,810
Oh, yeah? What did you get me?

667
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:13,963
- A Maserati.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

668
00:27:13,978 --> 00:27:16,321
It's amazing how a Maserati can
fit behind the bed like that.

669
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:18,221
I haven't put it together yet,
which reminds me --

670
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:19,690
do you have any masking
tape I can borrow?

671
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,840
You're gonna assemble the
Maserati with masking tape?

672
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:24,661
Don't ask questions! Get out of here.
It's Santa's workshop!

673
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:28,990
Rory!

674
00:27:29,388 --> 00:27:30,971
We have to go shopping,

675
00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:32,960
get your dad a Maserati!

676
00:27:36,926 --> 00:27:39,751
So of course I spun the record
for like a week straight,

677
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:42,021
because who wouldn't want to listen
to art brut for a week straight?

678
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:43,411
Pass me your lyrics.

679
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:45,512
Yeah. Here they are.

680
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:48,883
As far as I'm concerned, "formed a
band" could be the new national anthem.

681
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:52,410
I swear I could literally stand
and cover my heart if asked.

682
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:54,593
Brian?

683
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:56,121
Brian?

684
00:27:57,808 --> 00:27:59,023
Whoa!

685
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,871
What's going on here, babe?
Everything okay?

686
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:02,509
You got to watch
the loud noises.

687
00:28:02,518 --> 00:28:05,671
Loud noises?
We're about to play rock music, Zach.

688
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:08,391
Oh, check out the mandolin.

689
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:10,081
Yeah, right.
She's a beaut, huh?

690
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:12,273
Yeah. Cool.
What kind of stuff you been working on?

691
00:28:12,286 --> 00:28:13,860
Mostly I've just
been messing around.

692
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,242
I wrote one song that was kind
of White Stripes' "Little Ghost"

693
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,773
meets The Decemberists
meets Gulag Orkestar

694
00:28:18,787 --> 00:28:20,482
meets, like,
"Losing my religion"

695
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:22,573
meets Jethro Burns on
that Steve Goodman album

696
00:28:22,587 --> 00:28:24,573
meets "Battle of
Evermore" meets the Smiths

697
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:27,281
meets... some other stuff.

698
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:29,812
- That's lot of meeting.
- Exactly.

699
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:33,273
Whoa. Okay, this is eerie.

700
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:35,640
You see the way I'm
holding my mandolin.

701
00:28:35,656 --> 00:28:37,542
It's exactly one of the
baby holds I've learned.

702
00:28:37,576 --> 00:28:40,551
See how I have it in the crook of
my arm with its head supported?

703
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:41,921
That's how you're
supposed to hold a baby?

704
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:44,431
One of the ways.
Man, Lane, I wish your mom was here.

705
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:46,862
This is so totally
"rock-a-bye, baby."

706
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:47,843
Fascinating.

707
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:50,892
So wait, there are different
ways to officially hold a baby?

708
00:28:50,908 --> 00:28:53,380
Yeah, sure --
you got your "hello, world,"

709
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,212
where you put the baby's
back to your stomach

710
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:57,192
and put your hand
under here for support.

711
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:58,550
You got your belly hold,

712
00:28:58,568 --> 00:29:01,880
where you put the baby's chest
down along one of your forearms.

713
00:29:01,897 --> 00:29:03,862
This is really great
for gassy babies.

714
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:06,122
Then you got your fruit basket,
which is --

715
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:07,421
Finally.

716
00:29:10,488 --> 00:29:13,521
Hey, hey, hey! How we doing?

717
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:14,811
Long time no see.

718
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:17,351
- Gil, how's it hangin'?
- It's hangin' great, my friend.

719
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:21,410
So, check it out. This is the
youngest of my brood -- Macon.

720
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,522
Macon, this is the band.

721
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:24,470
What up?

722
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:27,450
The sitter flaked,
and I got Macon the bacon under my wing.

723
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,133
That's cool.

724
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:30,163
Sorry for the short notice,
but I figured you guys would be

725
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:33,952
a little more understanding being
that you're in the family way.

726
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:36,151
Speaking of which...

727
00:29:36,168 --> 00:29:37,863
Whoa! Check you out, Lane.

728
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:40,963
You are some kind of
serious fertility goddess.

729
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:41,873
Thanks.

730
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:43,722
Zach, nice work, man.

731
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:47,072
So, I thought we should warm up by
practicing some of our old songs.

732
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,920
And then maybe Zach could show us what
he's been doing with the mandolin.

733
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,370
The mandolin.

734
00:29:53,236 --> 00:29:54,452
Right on.

735
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:57,050
Oh, man!
You got the Alcmere 3000!

736
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,160
- The what?
- The breast pump.

737
00:29:59,178 --> 00:30:02,282
I'm psyched you guys picked this one.
It's really gentle.

738
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:04,303
I mean,
my wife's got sensitive nipples.

739
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:06,303
This one didn't
bum her out at all.

740
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:09,103
- You use that to pump...
- Milk. Sure.

741
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:11,392
That's if you choose to go
the breast-feeding route.

742
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:13,972
You guys, I'm sure Brian
is not interested in this.

743
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:15,122
Breast-feeding, huh?

744
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:17,521
Yeah. I mean,
some people go with the formula deal,

745
00:30:17,537 --> 00:30:18,921
which is cool, too.

746
00:30:18,936 --> 00:30:21,321
Actually, for baby number two,
we did use formula.

747
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:22,052
Yeah?

748
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:25,761
I mean, if you use formula,
the old lady can smoke, drink,

749
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:29,221
eat as many tacos as she wants --
no problemo.

750
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:30,443
You hear that, babe?

751
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,833
Yeah. Tacos. Thrilling.

752
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:35,033
Why can't they make books
out of something lighter?

753
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:35,973
Lighter than paper?

754
00:30:35,985 --> 00:30:37,503
I'm being punished
for being generous.

755
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:39,471
That's what you get for
having so many smart friends.

756
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:41,140
So I think we're doing well.

757
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:42,173
Yeah, I think we're done.

758
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:43,883
Oh wait, Babette.
Do we have something for Babette?

759
00:30:43,915 --> 00:30:45,723
The needlepoint pillow
with the sassy saying.

760
00:30:45,736 --> 00:30:48,803
Oh yeah.
Hey, you know, it's kind of impressive

761
00:30:48,818 --> 00:30:50,921
when people curse
in needlepoint.

762
00:30:50,937 --> 00:30:52,272
There's something
laborious about it.

763
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,083
And I got cologne for Michel and
the same cologne for my mother.

764
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:55,713
Weird.

765
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:57,000
Well, they'll both hate
whatever I give them,

766
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:59,380
so I figured,
why spend time picking out doomed gifts?

767
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:02,551
Then I have whatever Williams-Sonoma
sold me for Sookie --

768
00:31:02,565 --> 00:31:05,900
a butter slicer,
a bread warmer/wine maker.

769
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:07,680
Well, I'm sure she'll
love her butter slicer.

770
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:11,032
If that's even what it is. I swear, they
could attach a stone to a piece of string

771
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:13,323
and call it a poultry pounder,
and I'd shell out 35 bucks.

772
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:15,142
So I guess all we need is dad.

773
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:17,013
I really want to get
him something great.

774
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,051
We have the sweater.

775
00:31:18,065 --> 00:31:19,443
And the really heavy book.

776
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:22,632
But I want to get him something
that he'll really love.

777
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,691
Well, we will.
I mean, we'll find something.

778
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:27,860
We have a whole mall here full of
post-Christmas prices. We'll find something.

779
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,853
Guys are tricky,
but your dad's really tricky.

780
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,923
What does he need?
What does he want?

781
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:33,270
Perhaps a poultry pounder.

782
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:34,881
Plus, he is my husband now.

783
00:31:34,897 --> 00:31:36,403
I've never bought
something for a husband.

784
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,712
I wish they had a special
store for husband stuff.

785
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:40,012
Hey!

786
00:31:41,306 --> 00:31:42,383
What do you think?

787
00:31:42,395 --> 00:31:43,352
Maybe.

788
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,920
I think he'd love it. Come on.

789
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:48,212
Oh, look at this one.

790
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:51,403
Doesn't work so good
inside, though.

791
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:53,211
Solar systems, 50% off!

792
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:55,711
That's not just a post-Christmas sale.
That's a post-Pluto sale.

793
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,980
- Poor Pluto.
- Oh, poor Pluto.

794
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:00,612
Hey, um, it's Luke.

795
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:05,430
Hi.

796
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:08,433
- I guess we should...
- Yeah.

797
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:11,920
- Oh! Hey!
- Hey.

798
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:14,173
- Hey, Rory.
- Hey, Luke. Hey, April.

799
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:15,222
- Hey.
- Hey.

800
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:16,593
- Hi.
- Hi, April.

801
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:17,771
Hi.

802
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:21,503
April showed up at the
diner today out of the blue.

803
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:23,351
You make it sound like
Pearl Harbor or something.

804
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:26,752
No, I mean, it was a surprise --
a nice surprise.

805
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,203
So, how's it going?

806
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:30,780
- It's -- I'm almost done.
- Done?

807
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:32,733
You're not talking
about the letter.

808
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:34,240
You're just asking in general.

809
00:32:34,255 --> 00:32:35,333
I meant, how's it going?

810
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:37,441
Good. I'm good. We're good.

811
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:39,803
Hey, I like your sweaters.
They're very festive.

812
00:32:39,818 --> 00:32:41,611
Thank you.
It's Christmas for us.

813
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,021
Rory was in London at
the end of december,

814
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:44,683
so we waited to do
Christmas together.

815
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:45,770
Of course you did.

816
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:48,200
- Sir, do you have a return?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

817
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,321
So, April,
how was your Christmas?

818
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:54,831
Well, I'm 60% atheist
and 40% agnostic,

819
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:56,863
so Christmas isn't really
a big deal for me.

820
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,530
Oh, really? 60/40, huh?

821
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:00,662
- More of a winter solstice gal?
- Exactly.

822
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:02,732
You went to London by
yourself over Christmas?

823
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:05,102
Oh, I wasn't exactly by myself.
I met my boyfriend there.

824
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:08,362
Oh. Meeting a lover in a foreign city --
how glamorous.

825
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:10,032
I can't wait to be
grown up and glamorous

826
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:13,123
and be able to make my own
decisions about where I go and when.

827
00:33:13,137 --> 00:33:14,651
Being a kid is the
pits sometimes.

828
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:15,982
It sure is.

829
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:17,580
Oh, thanks.

830
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:19,302
What'd you get?

831
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:22,542
Well, my dad got me the greatest
present ever -- a rock-polishing kit --

832
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,211
but I had already gotten
it from my grandma,

833
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:27,202
who's very into Christmas.

834
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:30,141
So we exchanged it
for this microscope,

835
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:31,753
which is also the
greatest present.

836
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,361
- Good.
- Wow. That's great.

837
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,030
My dad's always been
a great gift giver.

838
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,253
I guess I don't know if I
was always considered so good

839
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,381
at picking out presents,
right, Rory?

840
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:41,443
Oh, no,
you've always been great.

841
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,092
- Towels?
- What towels.

842
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,350
- You meant well.
- You gave her towels?

843
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:46,311
For my birthday.

844
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:48,442
I had them monogrammed.
I thought it was cool.

845
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:50,623
Yes, you went through quite
the monogramming phase.

846
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:53,790
I believe you received monogrammed
pencils, a monogrammed mug,

847
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:56,232
a monogrammed backpack,
and a monogrammed belt.

848
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:58,860
No one ever tried to steal that belt.
Those were my favorite towels.

849
00:33:58,895 --> 00:34:00,031
I still have the washcloth.

850
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,273
That's hilarious.

851
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:03,730
Remember the year you got me the
unicorn marionette with the purple horn?

852
00:34:03,765 --> 00:34:05,342
You didn't like the
unicorn marionette?

853
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:07,342
I've never really been
that into unicorns.

854
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:08,541
I thought you loved that.

855
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:10,013
I know,
because I was being polite.

856
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:11,393
Being polite can be dangerous.

857
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:13,153
Yes, it totally backfired,

858
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:16,201
because for the next five years,
I only got unicorn items --

859
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:18,821
unicorn sweatshirt,
unicorn pencil case,

860
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:21,092
bumper sticker --
"I brake for unicorns."

861
00:34:21,107 --> 00:34:23,530
You were always so nice.
You never forgot my birthday.

862
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:26,011
And every holiday,
there was a monogrammed unicorn item.

863
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:28,462
Dad, for the record,
I'm not really into unicorns, either.

864
00:34:28,477 --> 00:34:30,611
Well, I'm glad to know it.
Anyway, we should get going.

865
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:32,041
I got to get you home, kiddo.

866
00:34:32,056 --> 00:34:34,430
Well, we have to buy up
all the Pluto stuff.

867
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,802
It's really gonna be
a collector's item.

868
00:34:35,836 --> 00:34:36,721
Sure.

869
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:38,830
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye. Have a merry Christmas.

870
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:40,151
Merry Christmas.

871
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,712
Honey, let me carry that.

872
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:50,053
- No, thank you.
- Lane, come on.

873
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:51,873
I'm perfectly capable of
carrying a bag of groceries.

874
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:54,511
Nutter butters? I put those
nutter butters back on the shelf.

875
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,802
I took them off of the shelf.

876
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:57,893
Your mom doesn't think you
should be eating many cookies.

877
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:00,590
Enough about my mom, okay?
Enough. I'm so sick of her.

878
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:03,313
She's been pretty great, Lane.
She cooks for us, cleans for us.

879
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:05,082
She's a total fount
of baby information.

880
00:35:05,097 --> 00:35:07,103
You know what? Maybe you should
have married my mom, then, okay?

881
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:09,120
Well, I'm sure when
your mom was younger...

882
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:11,763
Hey, I'm just saying,
she's a handsome woman.

883
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:13,720
What? I'm just saying that
I bet when she was younger,

884
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:15,263
she used to look a
little like you --

885
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:18,110
shorter hair, no glasses,
maybe a bit more crabby. Maybe.

886
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:19,523
Well, I'm sick of her.

887
00:35:19,538 --> 00:35:21,323
- That's kind of harsh.
- I am. I'm sick oh her.

888
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,810
I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of
being treated like I'm not a person,

889
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:26,853
like I'm some incubator whose
puffy ankles and varicose veins

890
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:28,781
and bathroom habits
are up for discussion.

891
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,890
On what planet is it
appropriate to ask a person

892
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:32,470
how many times a
day she urinates?

893
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:34,342
- You can ask me.
- I don't want to ask you.

894
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:36,782
Six times today so far.
I had a lot of coffee.

895
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:39,292
I'm sick of being told what
to eat and what I shouldn't

896
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:41,430
and what side I should
sleep on when I lie down.

897
00:35:41,445 --> 00:35:43,440
I'm a person, Zach.
I'm an adult.

898
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,191
I don't want to be hiding
things under the floorboards

899
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:46,453
and behind cushions again.

900
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:48,910
Yeah, that's no good. Plus,
we're starting to get ants and mites.

901
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:50,511
I don't want
everything to change

902
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:51,932
just because we're
having these babies.

903
00:35:51,968 --> 00:35:54,430
But things are going to change.
There's no getting around it.

904
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:57,250
Really, really soon,
we're gonna have two babies --

905
00:35:57,268 --> 00:35:58,691
two alive human sons.

906
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,412
It was such a small window --

907
00:36:00,428 --> 00:36:02,362
a peephole, really.

908
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:04,213
For years,
I was this repressed kid,

909
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:07,402
and then there was the
briefest of windows.

910
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,060
And then -- slam.

911
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:12,041
All of a sudden,
I'm this overburdened mother.

912
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:13,923
I barely got to do it, Zach.

913
00:36:13,948 --> 00:36:15,810
I barely got the
chance to be a person.

914
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:18,663
No, no, you can still be a person
and still be rock 'n' roll.

915
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,760
Having babies doesn't mean
you can't be rock 'n' roll.

916
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:21,782
I don't know.

917
00:36:21,797 --> 00:36:24,472
Give me a break. Sonic Youth has a kid,
and they're still way cool.

918
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:25,272
Yeah.

919
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:27,342
And Mick Jagger --
that cat has like 15 kids,

920
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:28,730
and he still goes
out and rocks.

921
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:29,652
Yeah, I guess.

922
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:32,822
For sure, the man rocks hard,
and then he makes another kid.

923
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:34,860
I don't want to make
any other kids ever.

924
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:37,293
All I'm saying is,
we can still go out and play.

925
00:36:37,555 --> 00:36:40,572
That's one of the cool things
about having your mother around --

926
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:42,752
- built-in babysitter.
- Yeah.

927
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,281
I just don't think I can bear
having her around all the time.

928
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:47,940
What about weekends? What if she
hung out with us on the weekends

929
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,713
and spent the week
back at her pad?

930
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:51,940
Yeah, I guess that'd
be all right.

931
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:54,483
Let me carry that bag for you.

932
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,903
I had such a good
time with you today.

933
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,173
I was thinking that
tuesdays after school,

934
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:10,753
I could tell mom that
I have chess club.

935
00:37:10,785 --> 00:37:12,790
And I really only have
chess club once a week,

936
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:14,423
but I could pretend
it's twice a week.

937
00:37:14,438 --> 00:37:17,242
And so as soon as school's over,
I could bike halfway to Stars Hollow,

938
00:37:17,258 --> 00:37:18,841
and you could meet me.
I could hide in the bushes

939
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:22,123
and do prearranged bird calls,
like a mourning dove or something --

940
00:37:22,336 --> 00:37:27,123
A "coo-roo coo-roo
coo-roo" as a signal.

941
00:37:27,138 --> 00:37:29,210
Yeah, I don't think so.

942
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:30,701
I don't need to do
the bird calls.

943
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:33,052
It wouldn't be right, April.
It woudn't.

944
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:34,690
We can't lie to your mother.

945
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:38,892
Your mother and I are not totally
seeing eye to eye on certain things,

946
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:41,560
and so we're sort
of in negotiations

947
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:45,930
to figure out how to share our
parenting responsibilities.

948
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,521
Do you have a good lawyer?

949
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:50,530
You better have a good one,
'cause mom hired a shark.

950
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:53,182
We're gonna figure that out.
Don't worry about it, okay?

951
00:37:53,198 --> 00:37:55,752
But the court case is the reason
that it's really important

952
00:37:55,768 --> 00:37:58,923
that we do everything
honestly and aboveboard.

953
00:37:58,936 --> 00:38:00,910
Yeah. I guess that makes sense.

954
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:05,130
Okay. So...
what should we do with the microscope?

955
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:06,023
Keep it.

956
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,261
I'll use it the next
time I'm over -- soon.

957
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:09,300
Okay.

958
00:38:09,315 --> 00:38:10,803
You can set it up if you want.

959
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:13,822
Just make sure that you
always remove the slide

960
00:38:13,837 --> 00:38:16,472
before you rotate the lenses,
or you can grind things up.

961
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:18,671
And always carry it with
a hand under the base.

962
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:20,240
I'll be very careful.

963
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:27,081
- Bye.
- Bye.

964
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,043
Don't forget to
put your helmet on.

965
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:57,233
# I'll be home for Christmas #

966
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:04,241
# You can plan on me #

967
00:39:05,496 --> 00:39:12,390
# Please have snow and mistletoe #

968
00:39:12,406 --> 00:39:20,292
# And presents on the tree #

969
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:23,520
Look at this -- liquid sugar.

970
00:39:23,536 --> 00:39:25,381
It's good for you, this stuff.

971
00:39:25,427 --> 00:39:27,000
You think?

972
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:29,012
You like the red or the green?

973
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:32,763
Red? Red the best?
I like red, too.

974
00:39:33,716 --> 00:39:35,832
Little. Little.

975
00:39:35,846 --> 00:39:38,070
- That's dripping.
- That's dripping.

976
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,500
You're making a mess, dad.

977
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:42,550
I'm not very good
with the cookies.

978
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,712
And what do we say
if anyone asks?

979
00:39:44,726 --> 00:39:48,371
We made cookies by scratching.

980
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:50,100
"From scratch."

981
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:51,593
From scratching.

982
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,490
Well, let's hope nobody asks.

983
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:55,101
Hey, G.G.,
you want to lick the beater?

984
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:56,983
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

985
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:59,031
- Hey.
- Hey.

986
00:39:59,045 --> 00:40:01,322
We're making some
cookies by scratching.

987
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:03,963
That sounds appetizing. I'm gonna run
out for a sec. I'll be right back.

988
00:40:03,997 --> 00:40:06,593
Okay, hurry back. "Christmas in
july" screening in 30 minutes.

989
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:07,860
Thought we'd start
a new tradition.

990
00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:09,240
Sounds good.

991
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:12,863
G.G., I think we need
some of the colors.

992
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,532
Can you put some
sprinkles on that one?

993
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,230
You want to decorate that one?

994
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:28,453
# Please have snow #

995
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:33,532
# And mistletoe #

996
00:40:33,795 --> 00:40:44,010
# And presents on the tree #

997
00:40:45,395 --> 00:40:55,760
# Christmas Eve will find me #
