1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,545
Previously on Gilmore girls:

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,006
You should walk down the aisle
to Frank Sinatra...

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,258
with a huge bouquet of something
that smells good.

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,343
Pot roast.

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,303
Max has asked me to marry him.

6
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,471
Yeah, I figured.

7
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,015
I haven't made my mind up
about the 'yes' or 'no' part.

8
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,225
Where are you gonna live?

9
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,267
- What?
- Here? Hartford?

10
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,310
Where are we gonna live?

11
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,728
Where are we going to live?

12
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,855
- You're going to have more kids?
- Personal.

13
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,398
I mean, he wants kids, right?

14
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,733
- Are you saying yes?
- What?

15
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,276
Are you saying yes?

16
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,741
He asked me to marry him and I said yes.
I'm getting married.

17
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,076
Well, I think that's very nice.

18
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,328
- Yep.
- Yep what?

19
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,830
There's nothing like a wedding
to screw up a family.

20
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,667
There's nothing like a family
to screw up a family.

21
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,336
You're throwing me
a wedding shower, aren't you?

22
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,465
It's a big night for me tonight,
and it feels like you should be there.

23
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,384
- I'll see how it goes.
- Okay.

24
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm getting married.

25
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,147
Oh, my God, here.

26
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,025
Wow, go with a crunch and a zing and a...

27
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,944
Hello!

28
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,489
Our house is burning and you can save
the cake or me. What do you choose?

29
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,449
That's not fair. The cake doesn't have legs.

30
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,285
So how are we coming here?

31
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,246
- Fran, so good. This cake is amazing.
- Beyond amazing.

32
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:23,625
I should hope so.
We've been doing this for 112 years.

33
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,170
You don't look a day over 106.

34
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,549
No, I meant my family's been doing it
for that long.

35
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,758
Right. Okay.

36
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,803
- I'm glad we got that cleared up.
- The raspberries.

37
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:38,182
- So when is the big day again?
- Two weeks from tomorrow.

38
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,768
- Have you picked a flavor?
- I don't know. They're all so good.

39
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:46,565
- You have to try them again.
- No, I've already eaten so many.

40
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,444
This is a very crucial decision, young lady.

41
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,863
Cake is the glue of the wedding...

42
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,325
so you will stand here
and eat until you decide.

43
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,869
- Okay, if you insist.
- I do.

44
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,955
After all, what's more important
than your wedding day?

45
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,667
- It ain't Guy Fawkes Day.
- Yes.

46
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,588
I'll just go and see
if there's anything else in the back.

47
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,631
Thanks.

48
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,218
How was it seeing Max last night?
No gory details.

49
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,386
Like I've ever shared that part with you.

50
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,554
You've alluded...

51
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,058
you've insinuated, you have
tiptoed to the brink of impropriety.

52
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,353
- Chilton has taught you some big words.
- That's kind of the point.

53
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,146
It was really great. I'm glad he's back.

54
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,148
He's on board
with the small wedding thing?

55
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,151
Yeah, we want fun, we want simple,
we want fast.

56
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:35,030
We've been completely in sync, without
that slightly gay, boy-band affiliation.

57
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,658
I printed up some sample invitations
for you.

58
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,826
I made them on my computer.

59
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:43,539
All you have to do is pick out a quote
for the front page...

60
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,833
- and I'll print them up.
- Okay.

61
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,921
'What is love?
It is the morning and the evening star. '

62
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,924
- Sinclair Lewis.
- Sinclair 'Sappy' Lewis.

63
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,092
Fine, next.

64
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,136
'And all went merry as a marriage bell.
But hush! Hark!

65
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,139
'A deep sound strikes like a rising knell!'

66
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,100
What is it with poetry?

67
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,394
- Lord Byron.
- Byron and Lewis, together again.

68
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,979
Okay, last one.

69
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,815
'We have buried
the putrid corpse of liberty. '

70
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,234
- Perfect.
- Mussolini it is.

71
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,820
Can I ask you an ethical question?

72
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,574
Is it right to be sampling wedding cakes
when Sookie's making yours for free?

73
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:22,286
What is right, anyway? Who defines right?

74
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,830
And if eating cake is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

75
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,833
I'm bringing out a Mocha Crunch Creme.

76
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,626
So, ethics?

77
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,670
Highly subjective
and completely overrated.

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,005
That's my girl.

79
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,230
And here's a sample
of some of my black-and-white shots.

80
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,273
Kirk, I didn't know you were
into photography.

81
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,358
It's my passion.

82
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,110
- Ever shot a wedding before?
- This would be my first...

83
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,988
official wedding gig, or photography gig,
for that matter.

84
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,908
But I've got the eye,
and my Nikon is state-of-the-art.

85
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,284
I've got a Nikon, too.

86
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,746
It's an N64 with 3-D matrix metering,
35 to 210 zoom.

87
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,666
- What have you got?
- It's a Nikon.

88
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,211
I got to tell you,
these are really good for amateur shots.

89
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,965
Thanks. That's me and my parents
on vacation in the Berkshires.

90
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,552
- Nice-looking family.
- And those are some self portraits.

91
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,429
Kirk, you're nude.

92
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,974
No, I'm wearing Speedos.
They're flesh-colored.

93
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,352
- Wait a minute. I recognize this.
- Nice photo, huh?

94
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,398
This is V-J Day. New York, 1945.

95
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,943
I include it as an example
of the excellence I aspire to.

96
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,404
- How much for your services?
- How about $150 an hour?

97
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,281
How about lunch and the cost of the film?

98
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,366
- You won't be sorry.
- Done.

99
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,827
- I thank you.
- Bye.

100
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,372
- What time is it?
- 10:00...

101
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,623
10:00 of?

102
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,666
- Three.
- I have to go.

103
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,751
- No! You're always going.
- I have to.

104
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,546
- Luckily, that'll all change soon.
- Yes, it will.

105
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,464
Two weeks from now,
you won't have to go...

106
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,425
'cause it's here you'll be going to.

107
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,302
- Going or going to?
- I'd add the 'to. '

108
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,637
Going to. You make me smarter.

109
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,307
- I am a teacher.
- Hey, don't. Stay longer.

110
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,433
I can't.

111
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,977
Take me upstairs
and see if you can get me into Mensa.

112
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,854
It'll take me forever to get back...

113
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,481
and I gotta get up early
and let the painters in.

114
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,359
- Do you have to be there while they work?
- What do you mean?

115
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,653
Isn't your apartment gonna be
all paint fumy?

116
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,781
- Yeah, so?
- So maybe you should stay here.

117
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,533
- Here?
- Yeah.

118
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:10,204
Instead of driving back and forth
all weekend, sleep over.

119
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,664
It's gonna be your place, too, soon enough.

120
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,082
Look at it like a trial run.

121
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,502
- A trial run?
- It'll be fun.

122
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,464
- You think you're ready for me?
- I'm always ready for you.

123
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,925
- Full time?
- I insist.

124
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,637
He was not wearing Speedos.

125
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,306
- Don't talk about the photo.
- The man was buck-naked.

126
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,767
Offer rescinded
if this conversation proceeds.

127
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,852
- I'll be back.
- Bye, honey.

128
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,107
- So what are we doing tonight?
- I'll do whatever.

129
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,319
- What movies haven't we seen?
- Just about all of them.

130
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,654
They all stink this year.

131
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,948
They definitely do underestimate
our intelligence.

132
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,033
- Plus they stink.
- There are at least five...

133
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,661
featuring someone doing
something disgusting with a cow.

134
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,039
They should at least do something
disgusting with a different animal.

135
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,375
We could watch Holy Grail on tape again.

136
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,795
Okay, but I am not talking
in an English accent all evening.

137
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,048
- No fun. Hey, tomorrow night...
- Life of Brian?

138
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,132
Max is staying over.

139
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,968
- Really?
- First time.

140
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,972
And to kind of celebrate, he and Mom
wanted to go on a double date.

141
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,557
But tomorrow's our anniversary.

142
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,601
- No, it's not. It's on the 24th.
- That was our old anniversary.

143
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,770
We broke up,
and got back together on the 6th...

144
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,691
so using the 24th wouldn't be an accurate
count of how long we've been together.

145
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,609
Unless you consider our time apart...

146
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,320
as a temporary moratorium
on our relationship.

147
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:29,533
You know, like the time kept passing,
and we were on a sabbatical.

148
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,286
- Yeah, it's complicated.
- Very.

149
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,124
- So a double date? With adults?
- No, just with Mom and Max.

150
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,418
What will it be? Like, dinner and dancing?

151
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,462
Yes, and then we'll enjoy
brandy and cigars.

152
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:46,675
- No, we'll probably just grab a bite.
- All right, we could do that.

153
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,430
Hey, let's have two anniversaries.
We can celebrate twice a month.

154
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,724
They're well spread apart,
the 6th and the 24th.

155
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,476
- We can't do that.
- Who's gonna stop us?

156
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:00,189
- Twice a month?
- Dare to be different.

157
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,524
Twice a month it is.

158
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,612
Why won't you let me help?

159
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,323
- Because you're a danger to the process.
- That's not true.

160
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,701
- I've got numerous scars.
- I cut you that one, two times...

161
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,411
and I've helped you tons of times.

162
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,705
You've helped me twice
and both times you cut me.

163
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,500
- I do like watching you cook.
- I like you watching me cook.

164
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,460
- What's that weird smell?
- It's food.

165
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,544
It smells weird?

166
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,963
No, just weird for this house.
It smells great.

167
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,299
- Rory, can you get that?
- What?

168
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,135
Right down there, with the shiny handle.

169
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,140
- Did you know we had that?
- Not a clue.

170
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,266
Come on.

171
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,018
- Hey, it's on fire!
- It's the broiler.

172
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,186
Wow!

173
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,397
What fallout shelter have you guys
been living in?

174
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,690
He has much knowledge.

175
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,818
- We'll form a cult around him.
- Build a statue many stories high.

176
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,613
- Grow our hair long and stop bathing.
- Please don't.

177
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,323
- Are we eating at the table?
- Wherever.

178
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,033
- TV?
- I'll get a tape.

179
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,619
- Can I at least grab some dishes?
- Far away from me.

180
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,954
Alarmist.

181
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:02,209
- You don't learn very fast, Injun.
- How fast do you learn, Billy Jack?

182
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,003
- Fast enough.
- 'Billy Jack, I'm gonna kill you...

183
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:08,298
- 'if it's the last thing I do. '
- He so jinxed himself with that one.

184
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,717
He should've said,
'Billy Jack, I'm gonna kill you...

185
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,636
'or buy myself a lovely chenille sweater. '

186
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,804
Either way, he wins.

187
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,681
How many times
have you seen this movie?

188
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,723
I'm out of digits.

189
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,017
You can't see a Billy Jack movie
too many times.

190
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,103
Who's the guy Billy Jack...

191
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,273
All right, you cats. Very slowly now.

192
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:27,025
- Let's do some jumping jacks.
- Spread out.

193
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,318
One.

194
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,404
- It's the counting part.
- He means it, Daniel.

195
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,781
Here comes my favorite
and my least favorite line...

196
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:33,866
all rolled into one.

197
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,201
I'm gonna cut your bowels out.

198
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,538
- Three.
- Comeuppance time.

199
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,081
You talk through the whole movie...

200
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,875
and when I say something, you shush me.

201
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,878
You're talking through parts
we talked through last time.

202
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,381
- We haven't seen those parts in a while.
- Now it's clear.

203
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,469
- Max?
- What? The phone?

204
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,346
- Whoever's closest answers.
- House rule.

205
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,890
You're both closer.

206
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,809
I'd have to walk farther,
around the coffee table.

207
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,644
- My foot's asleep.
- Plus you're taller.

208
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,814
- With longer legs.
- Even if we all left for the phone...

209
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,232
- at the same time...
- I got it.

210
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,650
You're in charge.

211
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,987
I'm gonna like having him around.

212
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,115
- Do you want a refill?
- Sure, same thing.

213
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,912
- We wore him out.
- We tend to do that.

214
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,247
Well, we are Electra Woman and Dyna Girl.

215
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:25,751
- Electra Woman?
- I think it's time to turn in.

216
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,336
- No, I'm awake.
- You don't look it.

217
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,839
- I'm waiting for the guy with the thing...
- Mom, get him to bed.

218
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,174
Okay.

219
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,343
Come on, honey.

220
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,763
- What happened to Billy Jack?
- I'll explain it to you later.

221
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,057
Good night.

222
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,727
This is weird.

223
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,919
- What is it?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

224
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:12,047
- Taking back Poland.
- Good luck with that.

225
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,591
- Mom.
- I have a boy in my room.

226
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,760
- So?
- So I have a boy in my room.

227
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,762
- It's Max.
- I know.

228
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:22,474
- You like Max.
- No. Yes, I do, but it's weird.

229
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,310
We've never had a man in the house
like this up there.

230
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,354
- He's your fiancé.
- Very true.

231
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,481
So all you need to do is adjust.

232
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,985
It's like that time you got
the green stripes in your hair.

233
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,863
- I hated those green stripes.
- Well, I'm tired.

234
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,490
I can think of a better example tomorrow.

235
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,034
No. Wake up.

236
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,623
- We've not properly talked about this.
- About what?

237
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,001
About having Max in the house.
The effect on you.

238
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,003
Don't cover up anything.

239
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,589
I don't have anything to cover up.
I like Max.

240
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,842
I know you do. That's good.
But once we are married...

241
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,178
- nothing will ever be the same again.
- I know.

242
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:03,307
It won't be the'me and you secret club,
no-boys-allowed thing' anymore.

243
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,225
- It'll be different.
- Not just different.

244
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,686
Our lives as we know them will be over.

245
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,063
- Mom, we're not dying.
- No, we're not dying.

246
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,692
But the life we had is gonna morph
into this mutation that we...

247
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,987
- could never possibly have conceived.
- Like the giant ants in Them!?

248
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,364
Yes, and I don't want it
to be like giant ants...

249
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,991
that's why I'm talking about it now.

250
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,286
I am not anticipating being attacked
by giant, man-eating ants...

251
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,455
- because Max is living here.
- Good.

252
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,665
- Good.
- Weirdo.

253
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,172
You can't walk around
in the buff anymore.

254
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,382
I don't remember
ever walking around in the buff.

255
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,593
- I know one time you did.
- Was I three?

256
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,553
Somewhere around there.

257
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,848
- Does he hog the bed?
- No.

258
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:48,060
- He's a very stay-on-his-side kind of guy.
- Good.

259
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,438
- He's cute. He wears pajama bottoms.
- Stop there.

260
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,358
Not funny ones. I hate funny bottoms.

261
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,236
I'm gonna call you Funny Bottoms
from now on.

262
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,988
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes.

263
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,492
- I'm happy.
- Then it'll be fine.

264
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:07,913
- You'll get used to it, having Max there.
- I know. You're right. I will.

265
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,873
I will get used to it.

266
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,047
Mom? You're falling asleep.

267
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,131
So?

268
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,260
You need to be a big girl
and go to your own room.

269
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,470
Okay.

270
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,934
- Fine, 10 more minutes.
- Thank you.

271
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,861
- More?
- Abso-tive-o-lutely.

272
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,280
- What's up, Taylor?
- I know of nothing up.

273
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,198
- What's up, Taylor?
- I'm just happy.

274
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,908
That's what makes me nervous.

275
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,036
You're a paranoid man, Luke.
I feel very sad for you.

276
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,413
Over there.

277
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,582
- Can you clear that one off?
- Why?

278
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,917
'Cause it's bigger. We're three today.

279
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,252
- Three?
- Max is with us.

280
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:58,672
Max? So when did Max become invisible
to the human eye?

281
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,257
He's on a paper hunt.

282
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,467
Max likes his three papers in the morning.

283
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,469
The Hartford Courant,
The New York Times...

284
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,929
and The Wall Street Journal.

285
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,307
- Three papers?
- He likes to be well-informed.

286
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:12,769
Reading three papers all reporting
the same news is a terrific use of trees.

287
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,980
You be nice, Luke. I mean it.

288
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,066
- Hey, there.
- Max, buddy.

289
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,235
Top of the morning to you.
You look good today.

290
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:23,030
- Brown is your color, my friend.
- Thanks.

291
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,491
- So?
- I got two out of three.

292
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,827
- Not bad.
- No one has The Wall Street Journal.

293
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:33,457
- This isn't a very financially-oriented town.
- Yes, it's more oriented to coffee.

294
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,709
I've got blueberry pancakes this morning.

295
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,586
- Bring them.
- Bring them twice.

296
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,088
- And you?
- I'm gonna need a minute.

297
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,510
- Well, then hold off.
- Same here.

298
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,845
- I might run out of the pancakes.
- Go ahead, order.

299
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,056
- I'll just be a minute.
- It's okay, we'll wait.

300
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,183
I'm almost out and I can't make more.

301
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,310
- Set some aside.
- First come, first served.

302
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,229
- We'll take our chances.
- Yes, we'll wait.

303
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,605
Whatever.

304
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,984
- You didn't need to do that.
- We're happy to.

305
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,119
Yeah, that's still eggs
and your basic breakfast stuff there.

306
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,412
- Just order.
- We're fine.

307
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,331
I want you guys to go at your normal pace.

308
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,708
My rhythm might not
necessarily be your rhythm.

309
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,001
- What's this?
- The lunch menu.

310
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,170
- I stop serving breakfast in an hour.
- Luke.

311
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,130
- I'll have poached eggs.
- Blueberry pancakes.

312
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,632
- Did we make it?
- I set them aside.

313
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,967
Love you.

314
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,972
- What the hell are they doing out there?
- What?

315
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,557
Who is that?

316
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,183
What are they doing, Taylor?

317
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,395
- Looks like they're coning off the street.
- Taylor.

318
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,981
If you must know,
they are a county work crew...

319
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:43,277
here to install Stars Hollow's
first traffic light and metered crosswalk.

320
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,365
- Hold it.
- Keep going.

321
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,368
You have no controlling
legal authority over this matter.

322
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,619
Stuff it, Taylor. Hold it.

323
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:55,080
Keep going. And I will not stuff it.

324
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:57,249
What authority did you have
to authorize this?

325
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,502
You're supposed to inform local
business owners of major projects...

326
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,753
per town rules, meaning me.

327
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,298
Not when it's a matter
of dire public safety...

328
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,342
where the city charter
clearly states that I can function...

329
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,344
unilaterally in the town's best interests.

330
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,681
Dire public safety? We haven't
had an accident here in 10 years!

331
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,225
You can't stop progress, Luke!

332
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,688
Traffic light, huh?

333
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,106
It's unbelievable.

334
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,693
Well, it could always be taken out
with your bare hands or your teeth.

335
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,028
Yeah, I guess.

336
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,447
- Hey, did you get my invitation?
- What?

337
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,617
My wedding invitation for my wedding,
because I'm wedding Max.

338
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,703
Yeah, it's in a pile upstairs somewhere.

339
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,998
Good. So are you coming?

340
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:42,044
You know, I have to make some calls
about this thing before it's too late.

341
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,046
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

342
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,221
- I can barely walk.
- Bad shoes?

343
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,515
- I ate a cow.
- You had a steak.

344
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,976
- Plus the sides.
- Four people, six baked potatoes.

345
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,520
You boys exaggerate.

346
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,396
- Am I exaggerating?
- Nope.

347
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,857
- Ice cream.
- I'm right behind you.

348
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,860
How could they possibly eat more?

349
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:11,281
- I'm kind of surprised.
- I know. They're bottomless pits.

350
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,283
I mean at you.

351
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,537
You've known them long enough
not to be so confused.

352
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,624
I'm not confused. I'm just...
What do you mean?

353
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,586
Their eating habits are just the start
of what you have to get used to.

354
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,880
There's tons of stuff
you should be aware of.

355
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,382
- Really?
- Yeah.

356
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:31,468
Like, don't ever use the last
of the Parmesan cheese.

357
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,971
And never get into a heavy discussion
late at night...

358
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,682
'cause that's when
they're at their crankiest.

359
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,268
- And go with their bits.
- Their bits?

360
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:43,188
Yes, like if you're eating pizza with them,
and Lorelai decides that...

361
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,692
the pepperoni is angry at the mushrooms
because they have an attitude...

362
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:50,237
and then she holds up a pepperoni
and it asks for your opinion...

363
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,906
don't just laugh. Answer the pepperoni.

364
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,199
Answer the pepperoni.

365
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,785
Don't let them near puppies,
they'll want every one.

366
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,495
That one I knew.

367
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,540
And here's a big one.

368
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:05,627
If you ever think that they're doing
something crazy, they're not.

369
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:09,173
After a while, their thinking becomes
clear, but by the time it's clear...

370
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,801
they've done two other crazy things
that you can't figure out.

371
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,303
So there's no catching up.

372
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:17,556
- You have much knowledge.
- You got that from Rory.

373
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:21,101
And does Lorelai know
what kind of ice cream you like?

374
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:24,897
- Yeah, chocolate chip. I already told her...
- Chocolate chip.

375
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,065
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

376
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,859
Wow.

377
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:34,615
I'm so full.
Why did you let me eat so much?

378
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,576
Yeah. They'll blame you.

379
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,001
- It's past 11:00, guys.
- Okay.

380
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,932
- How're you doing?
- I'm stable.

381
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,475
You're a lovely shade of puce.

382
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,187
Don't say puce. It sounds like
another word I don't want to hear now.

383
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,396
Sorry.

384
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,066
You know, they're still outside.

385
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,902
- Who?
- Rory and Dean.

386
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,947
How long you think they'll be out there?

387
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,574
- I don't know.
- So there's no time limit?

388
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:20,786
Yes. When they both get tired of saying,
'No, you're prettier'...

389
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,538
to each other, the night's over.

390
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,997
- Come on.
- What?

391
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,584
- I'm going to be living here soon.
- I know that.

392
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,295
I just thought I should know
what the procedure is...

393
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,549
- when stuff like this comes up.
- Stuff like what?

394
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:38,220
Say you're not here, I come home,
there's Rory and Dean in the dark...

395
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,723
all alone, after 11:00.
How do I handle stuff like that?

396
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:44,434
Max, Rory is very low maintenance.

397
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,979
Kind of like that robot kid in Al.

398
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,023
Only way less mother-obsessed.
My God, that kid was so annoying.

399
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,068
I would have pushed him out of the car
while it was moving.

400
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:57,155
What if I catch them one night
making out on the couch?

401
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,910
- Turn off the light?
- You're not being serious.

402
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,454
Max, they're teenagers.
They can kiss a little bit.

403
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:08,125
Okay, what do I do
if Rory comes home drunk?

404
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,544
- Come on!
- It happens.

405
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,087
Not to Rory, it doesn't.

406
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:15,841
I know, but theoretically,
just in a make-believe world...

407
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,718
if she did, what would I do?

408
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,346
- Nothing.
- Excuse me?

409
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,183
You would do nothing. I would handle it.

410
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,186
So basically, I have no role in Rory's life.

411
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,105
Max, Rory's done. She's brought up.

412
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,608
She's Rory. You don't need a role.

413
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,484
Fine.

414
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,529
I don't see the problem here.

415
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:41,700
Clearly. So I should do nothing
around here, ever.

416
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,119
- No, not nothing ever.
- What, then?

417
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:47,039
Making the garlic bread the other night
was really good.

418
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,958
So other than making garlic bread
and answering the phone...

419
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,127
what else is my role around here?

420
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:57,257
You're my fellow.
You're my guy, my old man.

421
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,010
- And what does that entail?
- All things dirty.

422
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:03,847
- I'm not joking. We're getting married.
- I know.

423
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,559
That means we'll take two separate lives
and meld them together.

424
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,354
- How do you think that's gonna work?
- I don't know.

425
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:14,024
- Have you given it any thought at all?
- Not really.

426
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,654
But I will. I'll start now.

427
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:23,075
How would you feel if I told you,
'I haven't thought about our future at alI'?

428
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,078
Terrible. I would feel terrible. I'm sorry.

429
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,915
I mean it. I'm sorry. Please come here.

430
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,587
Remember, it's all those
little annoying quirks...

431
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,675
that make me the fascinating woman
you fell in love with.

432
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,099
Really not fair.

433
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,143
I've got a lingerie drawer
full of not fair, mister.

434
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:53,230
Okay. We didn't need
to get into this tonight.

435
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:57,025
I definitely broke Dean's
late-night cranky rule.

436
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,905
- Whose what?
- Nothing.

437
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,581
Welcome, townspeople.

438
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,710
So you're going to spoil it
right off the bat, Luke?

439
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,295
- Why waste time?
- What about dinner?

440
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:19,298
- You don't eat at a bachelorette party.
- You got to eat.

441
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,884
You drink, dance, party,
and drink some more.

442
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,969
I'll hurl before the night's half over.

443
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,598
- This is all very fascinating.
- Sorry, we'll keep it down.

444
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,474
- How about keeping it silent?
- Way down.

445
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,603
- Or zipping it shut?
- Little, tiny mice voices.

446
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:36,648
Townspeople, we should all be proud
of the new addition to our streets.

447
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,652
I know many of you have wanted
a traffic light and a crosswalk for years...

448
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:41,695
What?

449
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,031
...and now your dream has come true.

450
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,033
- It's like Hitler's Germany.
- Luke!

451
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,745
You're trying to brainwash us, telling us
we want something that we don't...

452
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,163
and not giving us any choice.

453
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:54,708
- Shush, we're planning.
- I heard. You're idiots if you don't eat first.

454
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:59,171
Everybody, let me segue into
the informational portion of our gathering.

455
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,216
If I can turn your attention
to the pole here...

456
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:06,512
you will see a yellow button
with an instructional panel right above it.

457
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,640
My God, that's the biggest yellow button
I've ever seen.

458
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:13,727
If you'll read the panel above the button,
you'll learn how the system works.

459
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,522
'To cross street, push yellow button,
wait for walk signal.

460
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:20,150
'When signal reads 'walk', step into
street and proceed to the other side. '

461
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:23,946
- It's written for morons.
- In big, stupid letters, too.

462
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:25,781
I hate being infantilized.

463
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:29,201
Does no one here care
about the spate of near-accidents...

464
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,328
we have suffered over the past year?

465
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,455
Near-accidents,
meaning they didn't happen.

466
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,667
Because they didn't, doesn't mean
we shouldn't ward against them.

467
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,545
Lots of things don't happen
that we don't ward against.

468
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,797
- Like?
- Like everything.

469
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,883
So everything doesn't happen here,
meaning nothing happens?

470
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,344
It's not nothing happens. Stuff happens.

471
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:50,013
It's that it's not everything that's...

472
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,725
Damn it, Taylor!

473
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:58,188
Now for some interesting stats.

474
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:02,901
It's you, me, Miss Patty, Rory, Babbette.
Babbette, you're coming, right?

475
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:06,530
- Doll, I'm sorry, I won't be able to make it.
- Babbette, no.

476
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:08,657
We're having Morey's parents
over for dinner.

477
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,409
If you cancel on them last minute...

478
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,162
they'll stick a red hot poker
up your you-know-where.

479
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:14,705
We'll miss you.

480
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,749
But stick your hand down the front
of some guy's pants for me.

481
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,878
- I hope you're talking about a stripper.
- Whatever.

482
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:25,382
The length of the walk-signaI's duration
has thoughtfully been timed...

483
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:29,720
to accommodate the pace
of Stars Hollow's oldest living resident.

484
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:35,184
So to inaugurate the signal,
our beloved Mrs. Lanahan...

485
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:40,272
is going to push the button and lead
the first historic group across the street.

486
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:44,026
- Ready with the camera, Kirk?
- Rolling.

487
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,614
The cap is still on the lens, dear.

488
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:50,824
Thanks.

489
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,077
I'm not wearing a veil at the party.

490
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,663
The bride always wears a veil
at the bachelorette party.

491
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:59,917
- I'm not wearing a veil at the wedding.
- You're not? I love veils.

492
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,961
- No, we're going cas.
- It's a big day. You gotta have some pomp.

493
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:05,214
- Elope and get it over with.
- No one asked you.

494
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,090
Eloping was not out of the question.

495
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:09,009
But you don't get a wedding over with.

496
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,095
Why not? It's a bureaucratic
civil ceremony, and a pointless one.

497
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,598
- Don't listen to him.
- He's just being Luke.

498
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,559
It's not biologically natural
for people to mate for life.

499
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:19,311
Animals don't mate for life.

500
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:22,064
Well, ducks do, but who the hell cares
what ducks do?

501
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,274
People grow and evolve their whole lives.

502
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:28,028
The chances that you'll grow and evolve
at the same rate as someone else...

503
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,864
are too slim to take.
The minute you say 'I do'...

504
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:34,618
you're sticking yourself in a tiny little box
for the rest of your life...

505
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,411
but at least you had a party first.

506
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:38,580
Okay, I'm tired of you now.

507
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:42,459
We're gonna finish this conversation
away from Crotchety Guy.

508
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,558
This place looks like fun.

509
00:25:57,683 --> 00:26:00,060
- They'll never let me in.
- They will let you in.

510
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,938
This is a felony, you know,
corrupting a minor.

511
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,731
We'll all end up in the pokey.

512
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,733
He's right. We're all going to the pokey.

513
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:08,569
Don't say pokey. It's creepy.

514
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,195
- Try to look older.
- How?

515
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,990
Look like you're thinking about
retirement, 401s.

516
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,534
You should've brought
your fake beard and mustache.

517
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,785
Who invited Mr. Snicklefritz?

518
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,662
He heard us planning and wanted to come.

519
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:21,206
I did not know the evening
included baby-sitting.

520
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,167
She's going to get in.

521
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,336
Sorry.

522
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:33,010
So my bachelor party's
come to a screeching halt.

523
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,052
What? Why?

524
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:37,055
There's been an accident.
I'm fine, but we're at the hospital.

525
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,515
My God, what happened?

526
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:41,560
We were coming out of the restaurant,
going to our next stop...

527
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,313
when my brother decides to
leapfrog over a parking meter.

528
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,523
- Why did he do that?
- Middle child.

529
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:49,484
- Poor Jan.
- Anyway, he didn't make it.

530
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,486
Ouch. How drunk was he?

531
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,656
He's saying that the parking meters
in Hartford are taller...

532
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,784
than the parking meters in Duluth,
so he miscalculated.

533
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,205
I've got a concussion. I'm good.
Let's drink!

534
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:05,083
- Hold on a second. You got a concussion?
- A little one, though.

535
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,419
- What is he saying?
- It's a mild concussion.

536
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,923
- We're taking him home.
- Take him home, then go hit a strip club.

537
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:14,593
- Excuse me?
- I am telling you, this is your last chance...

538
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,428
to look at another woman's breastage.

539
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,931
Point well taken. I'll call you tomorrow.

540
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:23,018
Okay, new rule for the evening:
No calls to fiancés or boyfriends...

541
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,980
or anything else like that.
It's girls' night out! Plus Michel.

542
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:31,944
It's $12. And it's 18 and over.

543
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,029
She's 18.

544
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:38,700
That's right, last week.
So it's a new 18, but it's 18.

545
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:39,910
You got some ID?

546
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:44,164
Hey, sir, make way for Rory.
That's her name and her only name.

547
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:45,958
Rory. Single name, she's that important.

548
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,752
Internationally known
international supermodel...

549
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:51,672
and sometimes spokesperson
for international products.

550
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:52,965
She's very big in Germany.

551
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,592
Ja, with the Lederhosen and such.

552
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,512
- $12.
- Thank you.

553
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,056
Danke schon, cutie.

554
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,446
This is a drag club.

555
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:20,784
It's called the Queen Victoria.
What did you expect? Tea and crumpets?

556
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:23,620
Guys, I guess we're going to
have to stand.

557
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,747
Wait, that one looks open.

558
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:32,337
Oh, my God.

559
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:36,133
What in Lucifer's reach
is my mother doing here?

560
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,510
- I invited her.
- You what?

561
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:42,347
Just a little surprise for you.
I thought it would be a kick.

562
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,437
Excuse me, sir,
you look just like my mother.

563
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,063
Hi, Grandma. Come here often?

564
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:52,024
I should say not. How did you get in?

565
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,860
Apparently, I'm an internationally
known supermodel.

566
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:58,155
- Happy bachelorette party, Lorelai.
- Thank you, Mother.

567
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:02,201
In the future, when you plan something
and tell a person to show up at 8:00...

568
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:05,537
it is considered good manners
for you to also show up at 8:00.

569
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:08,415
I didn't actually invite you, Mother.
Michel did.

570
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:11,043
- I feel much better now.
- Let's drink.

571
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,171
Looks like Emily's gotten a head start.
What are you drinking?

572
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,840
Manhattan. Good, too. Not too sweet.

573
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,968
I ordered it from that nice chap
dressed as Joan Crawford.

574
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:24,681
So is there no dancing here?
I was hoping there'd be dancing.

575
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,642
You need to strut, Tony Manero?

576
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:29,144
It is a weekend, and on the weekends,
I like to move.

577
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:31,063
And the ladies, they like it, too.

578
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,398
Especially when you move out of town.

579
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,568
- Has she eaten?
- Yeah, about a quart of wine.

580
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,071
- Hi, Mae West.
- What can I get for you?

581
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,697
My dignity back.

582
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:44,910
A rum and coke, margarita, no salt,
martini with olives, a Shirley Temple.

583
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,412
- Love her.
- I'll have her on the rocks, please.

584
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:51,416
And I'll have a giant Long Island Iced Tea.

585
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,751
Coming up.

586
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,295
Lorelai, how're you feeling?

587
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:58,590
I'm tipsy, but just short of seeing
pink elephants.

588
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:01,218
I mean about you getting married.
It's only a week away.

589
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,181
I'm fine. I figured once I got the shoes to
match the dress, the rest was just gravy.

590
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,392
I must say, I admire your composure.

591
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,310
The week before my wedding,
I was a wreck.

592
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:13,772
- So was I, before all of mine.
- How many was that?

593
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:18,026
There was Sinjen, John, Sergio, Sinjen.
Three men, four times.

594
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,403
You regret any of them?

595
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:22,865
Sinjen was a letdown the second time...

596
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:25,576
but he was my Burton,
and I was his Taylor.

597
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:28,537
I just wish I could've found
a little Mike Todd in the middle.

598
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,832
I can't believe it was 34 years ago
that I married Richard.

599
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,584
I remember it so distinctly.

600
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:37,296
- There's going to be a romantic story.
- My stomach was not my friend.

601
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:40,799
- It was full of butterflies, I couldn't eat.
- What a bummer.

602
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,844
I was actually weak in the knees,
trembling all the time.

603
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:44,928
Really?

604
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,599
When I wasn't actually with Richard,
I was thinking about him constantly.

605
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,643
Imagining what he was doing,
was he thinking about me...

606
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,854
making up little scenarios in my head...

607
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:56,940
about how we'd run into each other
accidentally at the club...

608
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,484
and he would be playing golf,
and I would walk by...

609
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:03,864
and he would be so distracted
that he'd completely miss the ball. Silly.

610
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,574
- It's sweet.
- I was in love.

611
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:07,868
It is wonderful to be in love.

612
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:12,706
But the thing I remember most was that
for the entire week before my wedding...

613
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:16,293
I'd wait till my mother went to sleep,
and I'd sneak out of bed...

614
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:20,172
and I'd put on my wedding dress
and my tiara and my gloves...

615
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,842
and I would stare at myself
in the mirror and think...

616
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,886
how very safe I felt...

617
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:29,389
how very right and wise and honored.

618
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,977
This is a very good drink.
I highly recommend it.

619
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,021
Okay, I've got to make a call.

620
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:38,273
- Are you calling Jackson?
- No.

621
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:41,944
Well, yes, but it's only because
I need to pick up...

622
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:45,364
something I left at his house that,
if it's still there, I should...

623
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,407
Hi, honey, it's me.

624
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,576
And who are you writing to?

625
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:53,622
- I just want to see if Dean's around.
- And thinking about you?

626
00:31:57,084 --> 00:32:01,213
- No, not you, too.
- No, it's... I'll be quick.

627
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,512
- Hi.
- Hi, who's this?

628
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:12,057
It's Trixie from the other night.
You never called me.

629
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:15,727
- Lorelai?
- You got me. What're you doing?

630
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,771
I'm just hanging out. What're you doing?

631
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:20,440
I'm at a bachelorette party.

632
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,985
- Cool. Whose?
- Mine.

633
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,487
Yours? Wow.

634
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:28,073
I know, I'm still kind of wow
about it myself.

635
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:29,366
Who's the lucky guy?

636
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:31,285
You don't know him. His name's Max.

637
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,745
- Right. Max.
- You do know him?

638
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,790
Rory mentioned him.
She didn't mention it was serious.

639
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:40,210
It wasn't. We hooked up,
and then it was going good...

640
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,838
and then we broke up
'cause one of us freaked out.

641
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,756
- You freaked out.
- I freaked out...

642
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,260
and then we got back together
and it suddenly got very serious.

643
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:49,344
So is he worthy?

644
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:52,389
- Is anyone?
- Bono, maybe? Bryan Ferry?

645
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,474
- Get serious.
- A young Tom Waits?

646
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:55,809
Now you're talking.

647
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:58,061
- What's he like?
- He's great.

648
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:59,980
Could you be a little more vague?

649
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,274
I don't know, he's Max. He's great.

650
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,276
What's his CD collection like?

651
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,612
Don't read into his CD collection.

652
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,238
Jazz? Classical? What's the story?

653
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:10,449
It's kind of a general collection.

654
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:15,704
Are we talking a dozen soundtracks,
a few Beatles, a Bob Dylan...

655
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,331
- plus a generic...
- I said don't.

656
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:18,415
Alanis Morissette?

657
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:21,877
A lot of people knee-jerked
about her first one. Cut them some slack.

658
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,421
- Dave Matthews?
- A couple of his things are good.

659
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,757
- Buena Vista Social Club?
- Stop it.

660
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,550
- Enya?
- I'm going to hit you.

661
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:29,635
We're on the phone.

662
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,971
- I'll come over and hit you.
- You're at your bachelorette party.

663
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:36,141
- Right.
- So why are you calling me?

664
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:39,603
Because you know me really well.

665
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:41,230
Yes, I do.

666
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:45,108
And I just wanted to tell someone
who knows me really well...

667
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,818
that I'm getting married.

668
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:50,656
As someone who knows you really well,
I say congratulations.

669
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:53,033
If you found the guy, I think that's great.

670
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,577
And you can picture me married, right?

671
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:58,622
Yeah. To the right guy,
I can picture you married.

672
00:33:58,705 --> 00:33:59,790
Thanks.

673
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:03,085
- You should get back to your party.
- Right.

674
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,214
- He's a great guy, Max.
- I'm sure he is.

675
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,591
- I was just kidding around.
- I know.

676
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,094
- I'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

677
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:15,264
- Can you put Trixie back on the phone?
- Bye.

678
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,440
- Michel leave?
- No. He said he had to shake his thing.

679
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:39,121
So how's your guy?

680
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,124
- How's Max doing?
- Fine.

681
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,585
Everything's just fine.

682
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:56,013
I think I know what an aneurysm feels like
before you have it.

683
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:58,849
Like a baseball
the size of a cantaloupe in your head.

684
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:00,517
- Good one.
- What?

685
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,687
- Baseball the size of a cantaloupe.
- Yeah.

686
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:08,525
Because a baseball can only be one size,
so it's a Yogi Berra type thing.

687
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,402
Yogi Bear?

688
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:13,489
No. Forget it.

689
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:16,116
I feel like crap on toast.

690
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,410
Where were you
after you broke off from the group?

691
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:23,332
I sat at a table with Janet Jackson
and Celine Dion. Very nice guys.

692
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:27,711
By the way, your husband-to-be
is out there looking annoyingly perky.

693
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,713
Slap him or I will.

694
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:37,888
What did I do?

695
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,557
- You spoke at a normal volume.
- Sorry.

696
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:43,560
I'm just mad you're not more hung over.

697
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,687
- I tried. I did.
- Liar.

698
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,231
I drank copiously.

699
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:50,734
People who've drunk copiously
do not use words like 'copiously'.

700
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,319
Ask my brother.

701
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:53,946
How is Mr. McMeterhopper?

702
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:56,198
Ironically, he feels better than you.

703
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:58,659
- It's so wrong.
- He's fine.

704
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:02,746
I was going to drop my printer off
at the house, but Rory wasn't there...

705
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,165
and guess who doesn't have
his own set of keys yet?

706
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,543
- I'm guessing it's you.
- It's still me.

707
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:09,294
Max, I'm sorry. I forgot.

708
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,838
- Again.
- Again.

709
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:14,091
- You're mad.
- No. A little.

710
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,844
- They're just keys.
- Try being without them and say that.

711
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:19,721
- I've lost my keys before.
- I haven't. I never got them.

712
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:20,764
You'll get them.

713
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:23,642
I'm trying really hard not to read
too much into this.

714
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,310
- Like what?
- Like you don't want me...

715
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:27,521
having keys or coming in the house.

716
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:30,941
- Max, that's crazy.
- Well, I need keys.

717
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:32,734
I need an assistant.

718
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:37,406
You need to think about someone other
than yourself for a few minutes a day.

719
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,366
Ouch.

720
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:44,496
That was too strong.
Maybe I am a little hung over.

721
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:49,751
This is not a good day
for keys or communication.

722
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:52,880
- I'll just bring the printer by later.
- Bring it tomorrow.

723
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:56,216
- I'll bring it tomorrow.
- Okay. I'll have the keys.

724
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:07,394
I can't believe schooI's already starting.

725
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:10,814
I used to hate school starting.
I once flipped the pages back...

726
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:13,483
on my mom's calendar
and tried to convince her...

727
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:15,110
it was June and not September.

728
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:17,279
- Didn't work?
- Oddly enough.

729
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:20,199
- I got an interesting call today.
- Yeah? Who?

730
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:22,493
- Dad.
- Cool. How is he?

731
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:25,037
- I talked to him last night.
- He mentioned that.

732
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,081
- I was about to mention it myself.
- That's quite a coincidence.

733
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:31,251
- Did I not mention it last night?
- No, not to my knowledge.

734
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:33,337
I could have sworn I did.

735
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:37,132
- Why did you call him?
- Just to check in.

736
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:40,302
- At your bachelorette party?
- Seemed as good a time as any.

737
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:43,347
- To catch up on calls?
- Yeah, pretty much.

738
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,390
Seems like a weird time.

739
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:50,145
- Did he call just to fink on me?
- No, he wanted to see what's up with you.

740
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,897
He thought it was weird, too.

741
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,483
Heaven forbid I ever use the phone again.

742
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,568
Was it when you told us
you were calling Max?

743
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:58,153
Somewhere around there.

744
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,822
Why did you say you were calling Max?

745
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:02,574
Honey, some day
when you're a little older...

746
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:06,578
you will be introduced to something
that is extremely seductive but fickle.

747
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,208
A fair-weather friend who seems benign
but packs a wallop like a donkey kick.

748
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,002
That is the Long Island Iced Tea.

749
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:18,298
The Long Island Iced Tea makes you do
things that you normally wouldn't do.

750
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,384
Like lifting your skirt in public...

751
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,720
or calling someone you normally
wouldn't call at really weird times.

752
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:25,764
I'm not looking forward to meeting it.

753
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:28,141
I'd definitely walk the other way.

754
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,228
- You know, Dad wants you to be happy.
- I know.

755
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:34,439
- And I really want you to be happy.
- I know, sweetie.

756
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,984
You are happy about all this, aren't you?

757
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:39,736
- Don't I seem happy?
- I guess.

758
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,196
Okay, then.

759
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:44,825
- I'll be in my room if you need me.
- Okay.

760
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,470
- What is that?
- It's a huppah.

761
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,264
- A what?
- A huppah.

762
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,434
You stand under it, you and Max.
It's for your wedding.

763
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:12,144
Did you make that?

764
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:15,147
Yeah, I had some time, so...
Give me a hand.

765
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:20,027
- Luke, it's beautiful.
- Well, I saw a picture in a book.

766
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:22,112
The picture looks better.

767
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:25,407
It's got carvings. Birds and flowers.

768
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:28,452
- Yeah, there's also a goat.
- A goat?

769
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:31,663
I don't know what it stands for,
but it was in the picture...

770
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:32,789
and you like goats, right?

771
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:35,876
- Yeah, goats are good.
- Okay, so there you go.

772
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,545
What on earth inspired you to do this?

773
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:41,465
You're getting married.
You can't just stand in the hot sun...

774
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:44,051
in the middle of a lawn
that hasn't been mowed in weeks.

775
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:46,428
- I guess he doesn't mow?
- No, Max isn't a mower.

776
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:50,557
Okay, you needed something. Here it is.
I'll mow it if you want.

777
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:53,101
We got one of the Petes
from the nursery to do that.

778
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:54,520
- Big Pete?
- Little Pete.

779
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:58,106
- He's the better of the Petes.
- We've always thought so.

780
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,318
Aren't huppahs Jewish?

781
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:04,238
Maybe.

782
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:08,033
Is it okay that Max and I aren't Jewish?

783
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,535
It's okay by me.

784
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:12,955
I mean to stand under it.
God won't smite us or anything?

785
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:14,164
I highly doubt it.

786
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:18,001
Plus God would probably have to get
a license from Taylor to do any smiting...

787
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:21,421
in Stars Hollow on a weekend,
so I'd say you're safe.

788
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:27,511
You know, I wasn't putting down Max.
He seems like a really good guy.

789
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:31,056
- He is, and you were putting him down.
- Well, I didn't mean to.

790
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,935
Did you mean all those things you said
about marriage?

791
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,019
What things?

792
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,689
- Really want me to repeat them to you?
- No.

793
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,066
I guess for some people...

794
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:44,695
marriage, you know,
isn't the worst thing in the world.

795
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:49,116
I mean, it's probably better than
being hobbled or something like that.

796
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:53,787
And people can evolve together,
don't you think?

797
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:56,248
- Maybe.
- Yoko and John Lennon did.

798
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,500
They just got closer and closer with time.

799
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:01,420
- At the end, they had the same face.
- It got a little spooky.

800
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,422
- But cool.
- Yeah, they were lucky.

801
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:08,427
I guess if you can find that one person
who's willing to put up with all your crap...

802
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:11,597
and doesn't want to change you
or dress you...

803
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:15,934
or make you eat French food,
then marriage can be all right.

804
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:20,022
But that's only if you find that person.

805
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:23,192
Yeah, if you find that person.

806
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:33,744
No one has ever
made me a huppah before.

807
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,456
Well, you only
get married once. Theoretically.

808
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:41,293
Yeah, you only get married once.

809
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,223
Pack.

810
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,724
- What?
- Pack.

811
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:58,435
- What's going on?
- We are hitting the road.

812
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,562
- What?
- Pack everything.

813
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:02,606
What's going on?
Why are we hitting the road?

814
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:06,109
We haven't taken a road trip in forever,
and the weather is perfect.

815
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:09,363
We can't take a road trip.
You're getting married this weekend.

816
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:11,615
- Do you have my blue swimsuit?
- What about Max?

817
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:14,117
- We need sunscreen.
- Mom, stop.

818
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:17,287
- What?
- Are you and Max getting married?

819
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:20,916
- No.
- Why?

820
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:30,467
Because I didn't want to try on
my wedding dress every night.

821
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:37,015
Where are we going?

822
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:40,769
- We don't have to.
- Hot, cold, rocky, sandy, mountain, valley?

823
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:44,982
- I didn't really have a particular spot.
- Packing for all contingencies. Got it.

824
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:48,402
- Light layers.
- Yeah, light layers.

825
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:49,945
Do you need a book?

826
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,198
- That Colette biography.
- I lost your place in it.

827
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:55,659
- It's okay, I have to start over anyway.
- You got it.

828
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:57,911
- And hurry.
- Are we going tonight?

829
00:42:57,995 --> 00:42:59,663
- First thing in the morning.
- Sevenish?

830
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:01,999
Fiveish. It'll be more like sixish.

831
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,167
Let's shoot for fiveish.

832
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,419
You are crazy, and I love it.

833
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:14,469
- Wow, totally deserted.
- We're the last ones left.

834
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:18,599
- So are we almost there?
- We're almost there and nowhere near it.

835
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,434
All that matters is we're going.

836
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:23,729
- We're practically gone already.
- Look out, world.

837
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,334
