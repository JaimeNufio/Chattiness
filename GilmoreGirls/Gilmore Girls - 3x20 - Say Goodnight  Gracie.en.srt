1
00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:03,338
- Get the wrapper. 
- What wrapper?

2
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:05,883
- The Tootsie Roll wrapper. 
- What Tootsie Roll wrapper?

3
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:07,766
- The one at your feet. 
- I don't see it.

4
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:09,420
- It's right there. 
- Where?

5
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:12,063
Marshall, stop arguing with me, my parents are watching.

6
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:16,774
Have you see these guys? They're hilarious.

7
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:18,735
- I got it, we can go. 
- Why are you holding it like that?

8
00:00:18,837 --> 00:00:21,283
Because when Lane left it here last night, it was a very different color.

9
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:22,436
Are you sure she's gonna want that back?

10
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:25,115
It's been left alone all night at a keg party. There's no getting it over that.

11
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:28,374
That backpack is permanently scarred. That backpack is Zelda Fitzgerald.

12
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:29,573
Well, Zelda's going home.

13
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:30,706
Okay.

14
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:34,362
Your first cop-raided party. I am just so proud.

15
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:36,573
- Mom. 
- I just wish I could've been there.

16
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,678
- It was no big deal. 
- Did they bring the paddywagon?

17
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:41,212
Yeah, but then we snuck out the backdoor of the speak-easy

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,538
and headed straight for the Algonquin.

19
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:44,249
- How was Benchley? 
- Drunk again.

20
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:45,866
So tell me more about this party last night.

21
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,670
I mean, I know the end, but what happened in the middle?

22
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:51,791
Lane's band played, they were great, and then people just hung out and talked,

23
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,819
and then, there was some sort of fight, I guess.

24
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:55,118
The cops came, that's it.

25
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:56,794
Hey, Luke.

26
00:00:59,118 --> 00:00:59,892
I'm in bed.

27
00:01:00,204 --> 00:01:03,302
I have ten more minutes to sleep. Not a lot of time in the grand scheme of things,

28
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:05,380
but still, ten minutes is ten minutes. You know what I mean.

29
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,968
- Sure, yeah. 
- Ten minutes is great.

30
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:10,373
And then the phone rings, and it just rings and rings and rings and rings,

31
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:11,683
so I pick it up.

32
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:13,061
And then hopefully got your hearing checked.

33
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,227
- Can I finish my story? 
- I'm just saying, that's a lot of rings.

34
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:17,547
And on the other end of the phone is someone named John

35
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:19,640
who says he's Kyle's father,

36
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,780
and Kyle threw a party last night without permission.

37
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:25,744
And two guys got into a fight and tore the place apart,

38
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:28,626
so John wants me to come down and take a look at the damage

39
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:31,699
and discuss some sort of solution to the problem of the damages.

40
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:34,551
Now, I don't know John, and I certainly don't know Kyle,

41
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,412
but I do know someone who would get into a fight at a party

42
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:39,414
and leave the place completely trashed.

43
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:42,534
It's a wild guess, but I think his name rhymes with Tess.

44
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:45,877
So here I am, heading in there to talk to John about Kyle

45
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,584
and discuss what is to be done about the Hummel.

46
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:50,060
- The what? 
- Exactly.

47
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:55,472
So let's get back to the party recap. Any little details you wanna tell Mommy?

48
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,873
- Jess and Dean got into the fight. 
- Over you.

49
00:01:57,971 --> 00:01:59,149
I was a contributing factor.

50
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:00,311
- Was anyone hurt? 
- No.

51
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,119
And that's why the cops came and broke up the party?

52
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:05,754
So not only did you go to a cop-raided party but you started the raid?

53
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:07,941
This fence is broken because of you,

54
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,834
this crap is on the ground because of you.

55
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,828
What's your point?

56
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:14,805
Did you ever know that you're my hero?

57
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:15,767
Oh my God!

58
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:19,439
You're everything I would like to be.

59
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:23,346
And I could fly higher than an eagle,

60
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:26,176
'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.

61
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,131
Oh, these muffins, they're brilliant.

62
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,673
Tell us you sell your muffin mix.

63
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:27,572
Sookie, these people wanna throw roses at your feet.

64
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:28,741
And I will let them.

65
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:31,301
Listen, Sookie, Dennis and I and a bunch of us others

66
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,118
wondered if you offered cooking classes.

67
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,228
Cooking classes?

68
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:36,590
Some of the better B&B's have them on the itinerary.

69
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,340
Oh, of course they do.

70
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:40,558
So, we do, too.

71
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:41,904
We will be your disciples.

72
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:43,283
Oh my gosh, we're gonna have so much fun.

73
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,971
We'll start with some spreads and jams, and if there's time - desserts.

74
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:50,179
I have this chocolate balm... oh, but breads... and soups!

75
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:51,689
Sookie, hon, we don't have a kitchen.

76
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,784
- Oh, right. 
- There's no kitchen?

77
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:56,169
Okay, not a problem. You'll all come to my house.

78
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,940
- Can't wait. 
- Cheers.

79
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:03,067
Make a note - if the guests are gonna wear those robes downstairs,

80
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:04,972
we need to buy ones with thicker material.

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,206
Really.

82
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:08,965
Seeing the sunlight hit Dennis gave me a whole new respect for Peg.

83
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,074
Hey, listen, Jackson's up in Rochester today

84
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:14,064
helping his cousin rebuild his Nova.

85
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,825
He's not getting home 'til late, so you know what that makes me?

86
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,361
- Available. 
- Like an intern.

87
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,184
What are you and Rory doing tonight?

88
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,237
I'm open. Rory's got plans with the grandparents.

89
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:23,851
I didn't know you guys were back in touch.

90
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:25,049
I'm not, Rory is.

91
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,340
Mmm, yeah.

92
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,386
Well, at least the family pressure's off you now. That's good, right?

93
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:32,277
I don't know. I mean, before this whole Friday night dinner thing,

94
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:34,875
I didn't see them regularly and we didn't talk regularly,

95
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,885
so it wasn't weird when I didn't see them or talk to them regularly.

96
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:38,833
You miss them.

97
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,263
No, I just feel like I'm not doing something I'm supposed to do. I feel guilty.

98
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,400
So what are you gonna do about it?

99
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,775
- I'm gonna hope it passes. 
- Sounds healthy.

100
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:49,692
Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.

101
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:53,942
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

102
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:55,586
Blessed are they...

103
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,062
So, how are you? How were things last night?

104
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:01,064
You mean, after my drunken call to my mother?

105
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,606
Yeah. What happened when you got home?

106
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:03,723
I'm not sure.

107
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:04,981
What do you mean you're not sure?

108
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:09,053
Well, after I finished with my Farelly brothers' audition in the bushes -

109
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:11,142
- thank you for the hair-holding, by the way. 
- Anytime.

110
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:13,584
Dave dropped me off at home. He wanted to come in,

111
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:17,384
but he's an only child and I saw no reason for his family line to end with him,

112
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,375
so I went in and he left.

113
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,484
- And? 
- The place was dark.

114
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:23,353
- No Mrs. Kim? 
- No Mrs. Kim.

115
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:26,206
- No Mrs. Kim. 
- So, of course, I panicked.

116
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,439
What does this mean?

117
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:29,631
I mean, when I come home ten minutes late from bible study,

118
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:33,021
she has a cow. But I call her drunk, tell her I'm at a party,

119
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,518
I'm a drummer in a band, and I'm in love with a non-Korean...

120
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:36,924
I expected there to be backup -

121
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:40,026
aunts, uncles, cousins pulled out from villages I've never heard of,

122
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:42,105
- but nothing. 
- I don't understand.

123
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:44,676
So I go upstairs to make sure everything's okay.

124
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:46,983
I look in her room and she's in bed asleep.

125
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:47,777
No.

126
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,031
Then this morning, I get up, I go in the kitchen

127
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,718
where she's making breakfast and I say, "Good morning, Mama."

128
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,644
And?

129
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,116
She turns around, looks right at me and says,

130
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,868
"Good morning, Lane."

131
00:05:59,232 --> 00:05:59,841
Really?

132
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,283
And those were the last words she's said to me all day.

133
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:03,882
So she's freezing you out?

134
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,241
No, it was more Stepford than cold.

135
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,762
You know, very calm, very serene.

136
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:11,023
Okay, well, let's think.

137
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:13,179
Maybe she didn't hear you.

138
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:14,977
I was drunk, I could've slurred.

139
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:18,454
Exactly. Maybe she thought you said you were at a smarty,

140
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:21,244
playing clock music, drinking fear,

141
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:24,024
and in love with Rave Smitchalsky.

142
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:27,455
- And how would that be better? 
- It's much less clear.

143
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,614
- What is that smell? 
- Your backpack.

144
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:32,935
Blessed are they which are pers...

145
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:37,209
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,

146
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,448
for theirs are the Kingdom of Heaven.

147
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:40,870
- You have to talk to her, Lane. 
- I can't talk to her.

148
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,156
Well, what are you going to do?

149
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:44,936
Well, first off, I volunteered to work this table for the next two months.

150
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,891
Plus, I told her I'd go to that Seventh Day Adventist college in Hartford

151
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,569
- and live at home. 
- Lane, no.

152
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,361
And I told Dave to forget about the prom.

153
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,391
- There's no way that's gonna happen. 
- I'm sorry.

154
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:54,896
Don't be, it's my fault.

155
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:58,484
And utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me, Amen.

156
00:06:58,828 --> 00:06:59,897
Okay, let's go.

157
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:06,093
- Sorry, David. 
- No problem, Archie.

158
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:17,067
- Excuse me, I'd like some ham. 
- Be right back.

159
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,229
But I'd like some ham!

160
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:19,945
- Is this what I ordered? 
- Yes.

161
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,575
- Know what you want yet? 
- Oh, no, not yet.

162
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,825
- You know what might help? 
- What?

163
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:27,088
- Opening the menu. 
- Yes, thank you for the tip.

164
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,283
- I need ham. 
- No ham.

165
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:32,434
- We got a shipment of ham yesterday. 
- No ham.

166
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:34,804
Caesar, there's a lady over there that has been saying she wants ham

167
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,832
for the last twenty minutes and if I go back there empty handed,

168
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:39,345
there's a fifty-fifty chance that she will eat me.

169
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:40,461
No ham.

170
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:42,894
Then sew some bacon together 'cause that woman is getting ham.

171
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:47,921
Excuse me, I don't think this is what I... Thank you.

172
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:50,115
Who ordered this? Look in front of you.

173
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:52,367
If there is nothing there and there should be, then this is yours.

174
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:54,512
Oh, here.

175
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,137
- Well? 
- What?

176
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,996
- You know what you want yet? 
- I'll just have more coffee.

177
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,611
More coffee coming up. Glad to make your dining dreams come true.

178
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,464
"Oh, who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew.

179
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,021
Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two, the candy man.

180
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,858
Oh, the candy man can!"

181
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:20,518
Yes, that's right, the candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love

182
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:23,887
and makes the world taste good, and I, ladies and gentlemen,

183
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:27,360
am the candy man. Your candy man.

184
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:30,417
I'm mixing it with love and making Stars Hollow taste good.

185
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,414
- Move. 
- In a second Jess.

186
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,500
Give him a taffy. I come to announce to one and all

187
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:39,562
that the day we all thought would never get here has arrived.

188
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,913
- Arbor Day? 
- No.

189
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,182
- The Day of Reckoning? 
- No

190
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,751
- The day the music died? 
- Kirk.

191
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:45,177
- Give me a taffy. 
- What?

192
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:47,129
I've got a million of 'em. Give me a taffy!

193
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,416
As I was saying, the big day has arrived.

194
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:55,726
The opening of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store!

195
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:01,364
Tomorrow from noon to six, there will be fun, balloons, ice cream,

196
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:04,860
and old fashioned penny candy for just one dollar a piece.

197
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,016
Come at noon, stay all day...

198
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,479
Where the hell have you been? The place is a freaking zoo.

199
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:13,274
Every table's full and I've got Sammy Davis Jr. here thinking it's the Desert Inn.

200
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:14,190
I had to run an errand.

201
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:16,087
Everybody's complaining, we're out of ham,

202
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,928
Caesar's suddenly decided to join the Slow Food Movement,

203
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,790
and I've got a guy who's moved in at a table for four.

204
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:24,822
He just sits, making it impossible for me to turn over that table,

205
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,587
and if I can't turn over that table, then that cuts way back on my tips.

206
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:30,141
- I'm sorry, don't you mean my tips? 
- What?

207
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:31,856
- You know where I was this morning? 
- No.

208
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:34,258
I was at Kyle's. His parents called me this morning.

209
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:34,853
Oh, yeah?

210
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:37,535
Seems a little party you went to last night got a little Animal House, huh?

211
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:38,370
Dean started it.

212
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:40,244
Oh, you're not really gonna use that one, are you?

213
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:43,168
He did. He sucker punched me and I was just defending myself.

214
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,897
Oh, apparently you defended yourself all the way through the house

215
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:49,092
and out into the front yard. You defended yourself with a chair that is now broken.

216
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:51,202
You defended yourself with a coffee table.

217
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:53,229
You defended yourself with an ottoman.

218
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,131
I don't need a recap.

219
00:09:54,273 --> 00:09:56,082
Do you have any idea how much damage you caused?

220
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,606
- Dean caused it, too. 
- The place was trashed.

221
00:09:58,713 --> 00:09:59,947
Dean trashed it, too.

222
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:04,269
- Are you trying to kill me? 
- Nope, it'll just be a perk.

223
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,615
Okay, well, here's the deal.

224
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:09,502
From now on, every cent that you make here goes toward paying them back.

225
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:12,135
- Hey, what about... 
- Dean's paying them back also.

226
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,128
How do you know?

227
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,498
Because he was at Kyle's house when I got there.

228
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:16,297
You're kidding me.

229
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:18,805
He had already worked out a financial agreement

230
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:21,340
with the parents and was helping them put a fence back up.

231
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:24,003
Man, he's gonna make some woman a fine doormat someday.

232
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:25,411
You are making good on this, Jess.

233
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:27,039
I have to get more coffee out of the store room.

234
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:30,296
Every cent is getting paid back. I never want those people calling me again.

235
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:43,464
Hey, you left your wallet! Hey!

236
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,583
Okay, here's the problem.

237
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,814
Every single one of my skirts is either too long or too short

238
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:57,417
for this season's acceptable lengths.

239
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,095
Which means I either have to alter or shop.

240
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:01,222
To be or not to be.

241
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,331
Just wait 'til you hear what InStyle thinks of you, young lady.

242
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:04,714
What time are you getting home tonight?

243
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,417
We have to go over the special graduation edition of the Franklin,

244
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,536
and of course we're completely behind, partly because Paris

245
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,533
can't let anything go to print unless she's proofed it a million times.

246
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:15,912
- Can you say crazy anal micromanager? 
- Not five times fast.

247
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,760
- I'll be home by ten. 
- That's all I needed to know.

248
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:19,628
- I forgot my notes. 
- I put them in your bedroom.

249
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,928
- Hello? 
- Hi, Mom.

250
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:37,547
Lorelai?

251
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:38,841
Yup, it's me.

252
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:42,993
- So, how are you? 
- I'm fine.

253
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:44,447
Good. How's Dad?

254
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:46,128
- He's fine. 
- Also good.

255
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,751
May I speak with Rory please?

256
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:49,641
- No, you can't speak with Rory. 
- Why not?

257
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,468
- Because I called you. 
- So what?

258
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:53,794
You don't get to request a switch when a person calls you.

259
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,564
I'm sure she's standing right there.

260
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:58,314
Not the point. If you wanna talk to Rory, you have to call.

261
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,346
Then when I answer the phone, you can ask for Rory.

262
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:03,343
But you didn't call, I called, so you cannot ask for Rory.

263
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:04,980
What do you want, Lorelai?

264
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,607
I just wanted to see how you were. I haven't seen you for awhile.

265
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:10,060
- Your choice. 
- No, your choice, Mom.

266
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:12,333
You're the one who called off Friday night dinners.

267
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,832
No, I'm the one who called off the obligation for Friday night dinners.

268
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,852
You're the one who called off... You know what, I didn't call to argue.

269
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:19,118
Fine, let's not argue.

270
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:20,699
Come on, Mom, this is silly.

271
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:24,811
I mean, think back to before the whole Friday night dinner thing.

272
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,271
We still had a relationship.

273
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:28,385
You mean the one where I would trick you into calling me

274
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,228
by leaving a message on your answering machine

275
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:32,031
saying I had something important to tell you,

276
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,755
but I wouldn't include the details so you had no choice but to call me.

277
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,316
Yes.

278
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,953
And then when you did call, we'd talk about the weather,

279
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,673
you'd ask about the DAR, and then you'd put Rory on the phone,

280
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,366
- even when she was too young to talk. 
- It was not always like that.

281
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,887
It was always like that.

282
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:51,078
Very well. The weather's fine, the DAR is staging a luncheon at the library next week.

283
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,051
You already said I couldn't talk to Rory, so there,

284
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:55,795
- I think you've fulfilled your obligation. 
- Okay, Mom, fine.

285
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:57,438
- Have a nice day. 
- Same to you.

286
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:03,818
It's for you!

287
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:07,515
- Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
- The issue is a disaster.

288
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:09,716
It's our last issue of the Franklin and it's a complete disaster.

289
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,730
I'm sure it's not that bad.

290
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:13,188
And that's why you won't need to Botox your frown lines on your nineteenth birthday.

291
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:15,809
Not that picture, no, put it down. Put it down now!

292
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,160
- How's it coming? 
- Very frustrating.

293
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,055
We just can't seem to get exactly the right combination.

294
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:23,342
All right. How about blue dress, blonde guy, black limo? Works best for me.

295
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,173
Yes, however, green dress, red-haired guy, white limo works best for me.

296
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:28,708
White limo with blonde guy totally doesn't work. It's too washed up.

297
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:31,114
I'm assuming this conversation veered off of the cover page placement?

298
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,409
How about black-haired guy, green dress and tan limo?

299
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:35,256
- Tan limo? 
- Good neutral backdrop.

300
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:38,345
Well, this opens up a whole new set of options. Bring the golf team back in.

301
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:41,099
Okay, why don't I just get these pesky Franklin articles out of your way.

302
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:42,480
- There we go. 
- What are you doing?

303
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:44,802
- I am working on the front page placement. 
- What are they doing?

304
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:47,183
- Staying true to who they are. 
- Look, prom is once.

305
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,281
It happens, it's photographed, and then it's there forever.

306
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:50,439
Planning is essential.

307
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,686
By the way, Paris, we left a space for you in the limo.

308
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,001
However, we're gonna need the color of your dress.

309
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:54,872
And a picture of Jamie.

310
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,807
And the amount of flexibility that you have with the color of your dress.

311
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,581
And with Jamie.

312
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:59,492
Thank you, but we've already made our plans for prom night.

313
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,647
Jamie hired a private car to drive us to the prom.

314
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:04,682
We'll go in, take the picture, depending on the level of lameness, dance.

315
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,770
Then he's taking me to dinner at Antoine's, followed by a helicopter ride to join

316
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:09,665
his parents out in Martha's Vineyard for the weekend.

317
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,061
- What color's the helicopter? 
- As you were.

318
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:14,841
So, have you figured out your plans for prom night yet?

319
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:17,672
Oh, no, but Stars Hollow is a much more casual kind of a prom.

320
00:14:17,786 --> 00:14:19,951
- Less Cinderella, more Footloose. 
- Still a prom.

321
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:21,004
It is still a prom.

322
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:22,377
I can't wait.

323
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:31,129
It's my own fault. I poked a slumbering bear with a stick.

324
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:35,691
I reached out and initiated contact with Emily Gilmore. I get what I deserve.

325
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,103
- You're a bad girl. 
- You know what really stinks?

326
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,853
They're having Rory over tonight for a movie night.

327
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,583
Movie night? That's your thing with her.

328
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:44,197
Exactly. What's next?

329
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:47,939
"Stay home and dance around in your underwear to the Monkees' greatest hits" night?

330
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:49,475
I wouldn't put it past them to steal that, too.

331
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:50,412
What's going on?

332
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:54,508
- Oh my God. 
- Fran.

333
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:56,818
- Poor thing. 
- I don't believe it.

334
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,260
- Such a great lady. 
- Great lady.

335
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:01,870
Eighty-three on her last birthday.

336
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,749
- A good long life. 
- We should all be so lucky.

337
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,347
- I'm gonna miss her. 
- Me, too.

338
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:11,880
- So... 
- Yeah?

339
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:14,882
I guess this'll put that old inn of hers on the market.

340
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,246
Right. I mean, she wanted to keep it as long as she was alive, and now...

341
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:21,195
- Oh my God. 
- What?

342
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,513
You don't think that because we wanted the property so much, we killed Fran.

343
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:26,500
- What? 
- Through the power of our minds.

344
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:28,835
No, no, we wished for the property, not this!

345
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,320
Yeah, but you never know with karma.

346
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:33,157
- Look, we loved Fran, right? 
- Yes, we did.

347
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:35,547
And whether or not we get the Dragonfly Inn has nothing to do

348
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,084
with her dying right now.

349
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,886
Right... sort of.

350
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:40,694
Besides, we don't know what's happening with the inn.

351
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,520
- Fran has no heirs. 
- You never know.

352
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:45,327
Some long lost gold-toothed cousin could come out of the woodwork,

353
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:49,116
inherit it and turn it into a beauty salon or law offices.

354
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:50,273
Not our Dragonfly!

355
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,896
The point is, if we are meant to have the Dragonfly Inn,

356
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:55,446
- then we are meant to have it. 
- Right. Like Doris Day.

357
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:56,709
- Que sera. 
- Sera.

358
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,516
Let's focus on Fran and how much we loved her.

359
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,749
- Not think about the inn at all. 
- Okay.

360
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:04,564
You're thinking about it.

361
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:06,177
Just about where to put the woodburning oven.

362
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:08,158
We'll put it in the apartment that we're sharing in hell.

363
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:10,745
- Let's buy flowers. 
- Yeah, lots and lots of flowers.

364
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,315
This is a really nice chair.

365
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:19,816
- Is it old? 
- Old enough.

366
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,874
Well, it's really nice. I mean, the back is very sturdy

367
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,664
and the legs are all the same length and the wood looks like

368
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:29,822
it was a tree at some point, which is good for wood, 'cause it was.

369
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:31,645
Could you get that please?

370
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:32,649
Yes, Mama.

371
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,583
- What are you doing here? 
- I'm here to see your mother.

372
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:40,790
- What? 
- Excuse me.

373
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:41,896
Dave, Dave, wait!

374
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,916
Excuse me, Mrs. Kim, I need to speak with you.

375
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:46,826
I'm busy, David.

376
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:49,346
A few weeks ago you told me that Lane had a crush on me.

377
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,343
Well, I have a crush on her, too.

378
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:54,072
Now, I know you have very strict rules about dating and boys,

379
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:56,622
but I just want you to know that I'm a good person.

380
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:59,454
I don't smoke, I don't drink, I've never gotten a ticket,

381
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:02,141
I'm healthy, I take care of myself, I floss.

382
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,906
I never watch more than 30 minutes of television a night partly

383
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:08,280
because I think it's a waste of time and partly because there's nothing on.

384
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,918
I respect my parents, I do well in school,

385
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:13,381
I never play video games in case they do someday prove

386
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,368
that playing them can turn you into a serial killer.

387
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,197
I don't drink coffee. I hate soda because the carbonation freaks me out.

388
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:21,952
I'm happy to give up meat if you feel strongly about it.

389
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:23,339
I don't mind wearing a tie.

390
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:26,079
I enjoy playing those hymns on my guitar,

391
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:29,540
and I really, really want to take your daughter to the prom.

392
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:35,929
Mrs. Kim?

393
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:39,505
Please don't make me repeat that list again.

394
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,977
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,

395
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:47,938
but still remember what the Lord hath done.

396
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,560
Okay, thank you.

397
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:03,231
- Did you hear what she said? 
- Yes, I did.

398
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,513
- What did it mean? 
- I don't know.

399
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:06,652
- Was it a yes, was it a no? 
- I'm not sure.

400
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:09,259
Well, it's gotta be from the bible, right? So I'll just go home, do some research,

401
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:11,722
look on the Internet, see what I can find. I'll call you when I know something.

402
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:12,782
Okay.

403
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:20,748
I'm so writing him a song tonight.

404
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:36,314
Left your wallet in the diner.

405
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:39,545
Oh, wow, did I?

406
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,632
Look at that. I guess I did. Thanks for bringing it back.

407
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,427
No problem.

408
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,089
You know, I really like this driver's license picture, too,

409
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:48,158
so you could imagine what a drag it would be to have to replace it.

410
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:49,181
So what are you doing here, Jimmy?

411
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:51,675
- Just passing through. 
- Passing through from where?

412
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,785
- California. 
- California?

413
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,545
Yeah, I've been there for a few years now, seems to be working out.

414
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:58,387
- Well, glad to hear it. 
- Yeah.

415
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,875
- So what are you doing here, Jimmy? 
- Nothing, really, just...

416
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:03,968
- He hasn't missed you. 
- I'm sure that he hasn't.

417
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:06,237
- Never says a word about you. 
- I wouldn't expect he would.

418
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,050
Do you know why he doesn't miss you, Jimmy?

419
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:11,424
Because you're a loser and nobody missed a loser.

420
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:12,858
It's been seventeen years, Luke.

421
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,946
Oh, you remember how long it's been. I am impressed.

422
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:16,339
Yeah, well, I always could count.

423
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,891
And your list of attributes ends there.

424
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,030
Okay, so I guess we're not playing nice anymore.

425
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:23,851
You know, the last time I saw you is right after Liz gave birth.

426
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,130
You were gonna go out and buy some diapers

427
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,050
and meet us back at the apartment. Remember that?

428
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:28,546
Yes.

429
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:30,783
You went out, but you never came back.

430
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:33,693
A lot of time has passed and a lot of things have changed.

431
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,479
Really, like what things? You?

432
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,466
Yes, me. Maybe. Why not?

433
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,473
Oh, come on, you never called before. Why now?

434
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:40,973
- What do you want, you need money? 
- What?

435
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:42,708
- 'Cause he doesn't have any. 
- I don't need money.

436
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:44,588
- I don't have any either. 
- I don't need money.

437
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,294
So the look is a choice?

438
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,447
No, I just wanted to... I don't know, see him.

439
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,851
- Why now? 
- I don't know,

440
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,451
I just thought it was time. You don't think it was time?

441
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:55,304
You really want my opinion on this subject?

442
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,486
- Luke, give me a break. 
- Give you a break?

443
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:59,953
I am trying to keep this kid from falling off the face of the Earth.

444
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:02,084
I'm trying to get him through school. I'm trying to give him a future.

445
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:05,249
And I gotta be totally honest with you, Jimmy - I am not doing too well.

446
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:05,685
No?

447
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:09,748
No, and the last thing he needs is a special appearance by his father

448
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,940
who can't be here for any good reason.

449
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,910
There's no evil plan here. I have a job, a life.

450
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,913
- I just thought I'd come and... 
- What? Say hello,

451
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,966
- see if he looks like you? Then what? 
- Well...

452
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:20,103
- What? 
- I don't know!

453
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:23,129
Okay, well, while you're figuring it out, let me plant this little thought in your head -

454
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:26,852
you do or say anything to upset Jess and make it harder for me

455
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:29,743
to keep him on the right path, I'm gonna put your head through a wall.

456
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:33,350
Any wall, you can pick the wall, but it's gonna be a wall, okay?

457
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:37,635
I just wanted to see him.

458
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:41,367
Well, you saw him. Now get outta here.

459
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:50,699
You know, Fran was one of the first people I met when we moved here.

460
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:51,396
I know.

461
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:53,398
The first day here, I stopped in...

462
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:54,954
And asked her for directions to the inn.

463
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:59,132
Yeah. She was so sweet. And oh my God, she loved you.

464
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:02,307
I didn't think she was gonna let me leave the bakery with you.

465
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:05,686
She just kept giving you cookies in a shameless attempt

466
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:07,808
to buy your affections away from me. And let me tell you,

467
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:10,861
for a couple weeks, it worked. For two weeks, you just kept staring at me like,

468
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:14,273
"You're the lady who took me away from the cookies. I'm gonna kill you."

469
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,694
Mom, can I just meet you at the church?

470
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,265
Why, what are you planning? Is it finally payback time?

471
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:21,432
I just need to stop in at Doose's and get something.

472
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,827
- Kleenex, we'll need Kleenex. 
- I'll come with you.

473
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:25,149
Well...

474
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:30,329
Patty...

475
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,825
Now it all starts.

476
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,060
What all starts, honey?

477
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:37,934
First Fran, then the rest of us.

478
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:41,261
Patty, it's not the plague. It was just her time.

479
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,124
- I can't go. 
- Yes, you can. Come on.

480
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:45,363
No, just leave me.

481
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:47,944
- I'm gonna get her to the church. 
- I'll meet you there.

482
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,311
Come on, let's go.

483
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:55,450
You know, it's times like these that you realize

484
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,579
what is truly important in your life.

485
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:02,850
I'm so glad I had all that sex.

486
00:22:04,446 --> 00:22:05,190
Hurry, honey.

487
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:18,855
What are you looking at?

488
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:26,853
Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed.

489
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:31,861
Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed.

490
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:51,815
Welcome all. The large number of people here today is a testament

491
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:55,122
to how much Fran Weston has touched each and every one of us.

492
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:57,586
We'd like to start by inviting Marjorie Rogers,

493
00:23:57,858 --> 00:24:00,202
Fran's close friend, to share a few words with us.

494
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:08,682
In 1955, Fran opened Weston's Bakery.

495
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:11,145
Back then, she was the new kid on the block,

496
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:16,720
and soon thereafter, she hired me, a mother of three rugrats and a husband overseas,

497
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,674
and we became best friends. Still are.

498
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:20,703
That's so sweet.

499
00:24:20,975 --> 00:24:22,670
You think we'll still be friends when we're dead?

500
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:23,658
I will if you will.

501
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:26,813
Fran was and is Stars Hollow.

502
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:29,873
And to ensure that her love and spirit continue,

503
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:33,587
Weston's Bakery will remain open and run by those

504
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:36,029
who have Fran's heart in their hearts.

505
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:41,656
Of course, Fran's family has been here long before even Fran.

506
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:45,972
They opened the Dragonfly Inn back in 1893.

507
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:52,189
The Dragonfly Inn was once regarded as the Violet Lady, the premiere inn in all of ...

508
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:53,136
What'd she say?

509
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,256
I heard "premiere inn" then squat.

510
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,516
Is she still talking about the inn?

511
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:00,315
I don't know.

512
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:07,631
Inn ... ortant role... ing... it's special... all who...

513
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:08,819
She said "inn."

514
00:25:09,362 --> 00:25:10,806
And "ortant" and "ing."

515
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:15,813
...set... World War...

516
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:16,971
She said World War.

517
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:18,378
One or two? Where are we, where are we?

518
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:19,900
Fran...

519
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,953
- She's pointing to somebody. 
- Yeah, it's a man in a suit.

520
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,202
- Does he have a gold tooth? 
- I don't know.

521
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:28,808
- You guys, people are turning. 
- ...to you all.

522
00:25:31,938 --> 00:25:33,913
- Did she say who gets the inn? 
- I don't know.

523
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,544
Thank you, Marjorie.

524
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:48,620
And now, I'd like to point out that the time is twelve p.m.,

525
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:52,603
the time Fran would normally be opening her doors on Sunday after church,

526
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:56,070
welcoming us to join her in friendship at Weston's Bakery.

527
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:00,406
So, if we may at this time all bow our heads for a minute of silence

528
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:03,381
to mark the passing of the soul and our dear departed friend.

529
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:12,035
No, no, the grand opening is canceled!

530
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:17,115
Sorry, folks. Stop, it is canceled...

531
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:19,720
Canceled!

532
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:23,508
As we close, I'd like to honor a special request Fran had,

533
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:26,336
and that is to take one final stroll around the Town Square

534
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:28,291
before going to her final resting place.

535
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:32,004
All those who would like to participate, please assemble outside.

536
00:26:32,147 --> 00:26:34,282
Walking with dead people not my thing. Let's go.

537
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:38,132
- Where's Sookie? 
- Just giving our condolences.

538
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:39,659
And asking what you missed when the mike cut out?

539
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:40,856
And giving our condolences.

540
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:43,111
The man in the suit's name is Brink.

541
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:45,159
He's a lawyer and he's here to get Fran's affairs in order.

542
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:46,228
Do you think we can talk to him?

543
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:47,671
Yes, but Lorelai, you have to get back to the inn

544
00:26:47,754 --> 00:26:50,585
and I've got those B&Bers waiting at my home to learn how to make jam.

545
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:51,814
Okay, well, let's get him now.

546
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:54,370
I think our window of opportunity just slammed shut.

547
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:57,349
- Great. 
- Now what?

548
00:26:57,523 --> 00:27:00,524
We very respectfully hover in his vicinity until the walk is over...

549
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:03,642
Then we will politely ask him to get in touch with us.

550
00:27:03,775 --> 00:27:04,211
Yes.

551
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,997
- Coming? 
- No, you guys go ahead.

552
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:09,218
I'll be in the back of the line so that when the earth opens up

553
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,160
and swallows you whole, I'll be here to tell a story.

554
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:11,763
Okay.

555
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:16,643
Hey, Rory.

556
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:18,358
Oh, hey. You were in there?

557
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:21,006
Yeah. I got here late so I kind of just hung in the back.

558
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,177
It was nice of you to come.

559
00:27:22,449 --> 00:27:24,447
- Well, she was a nice lady. 
- Yeah, she was.

560
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,747
Listen, can I talk to you for a sec? We'll catch up, I promise.

561
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,017
- Sure. 
- Good.

562
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:32,573
- Okay... 
- What?

563
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:34,477
Come on.

564
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,006
Dean, what are you doing?

565
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:38,061
Okay.

566
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,547
- Are you ready? 
- Yes, I'm ready.

567
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:44,282
I asked Lindsay to marry me.

568
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,224
- You... you... 
- And she said yes.

569
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:50,576
- She... she...
- So what do you think?

570
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,644
- I... I... 
- I know, who woulda thought?

571
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:57,329
I mean, it's weird, but Lindsay's amazing and I asked and she said yes, so...

572
00:27:58,015 --> 00:27:58,972
I'm getting married.

573
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:01,665
Say something.

574
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,289
Why?

575
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:04,799
What?

576
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:06,786
No, I don't mean why, I mean, why now?

577
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:08,122
Why not now?

578
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,883
Well, you're eighteen, first of all.

579
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:12,112
- So? 
- So, you're young.

580
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,607
I mean, you haven't even gone to college yet.

581
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:15,695
Oh my God, you are still going to college, aren't you?

582
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:17,549
Yes, Rory, I'm still going to college.

583
00:28:17,651 --> 00:28:19,689
- Well, how... 
- Lindsay's gonna go with me.

584
00:28:19,818 --> 00:28:22,106
But Dean, you're going to be studying and taking classes,

585
00:28:22,224 --> 00:28:23,309
you need to focus on that.

586
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,030
I mean, you don't even know what you wanna do yet.

587
00:28:25,177 --> 00:28:27,570
And you guys haven't even been going out for that long.

588
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:29,910
I mean, why don't you just date for awhile? Dating's fun.

589
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:31,189
Thank you.

590
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:32,357
For what?

591
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,921
For your deep heartfelt congratulations.

592
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:37,293
You just... you took me by surprise.

593
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:40,806
So what? It's good news, you can't just be happy for me?

594
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:42,521
I can. I am. I just...

595
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:45,332
You know what, I'm sorry if you have a crappy relationship with Jess.

596
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:46,443
Hey, that has...

597
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:48,604
And I'm sorry if he treats you like dirt and everyone hates him,

598
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,782
but that was your choice.

599
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:52,203
I have a great girlfriend and I am really happy,

600
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:55,205
and when you dumped me for that jackass, I thought I'd never be happy again.

601
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:56,750
Jess does not treat me like dirt.

602
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,518
Whatever.

603
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,611
I just wanted you to hear it from me before it got out.

604
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:02,526
Now you know, so...

605
00:29:03,596 --> 00:29:04,580
have a nice life.

606
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:08,213
Jess does not treat me like dirt!

607
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,581
Mama, do you need any help?

608
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:15,102
No, thank you.

609
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:20,682
- I could get out the soy scones. 
- If you like.

610
00:29:23,232 --> 00:29:23,785
Tofutter?

611
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:24,983
Fine.

612
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:33,356
Mama, I'm really sorry about the other night. I did everything wrong,

613
00:29:33,617 --> 00:29:36,448
everything you taught me not to do. I lied to you, I let you down.

614
00:29:36,678 --> 00:29:39,152
I never intended to do that and I don't know how to fix it,

615
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,525
but I'm going to try my hardest because I am so, so sorry.

616
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:47,467
I'll be upstairs if you need me. I'm gonna go in my room,

617
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:50,180
gonna iron my dress for church and I'm gonna think about what I've done.

618
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:04,067
I stayed up all night.

619
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:06,541
I read the entire bible cover to cover.

620
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,875
- I don't know what it means. 
- David.

621
00:30:08,992 --> 00:30:11,743
You have to tell me what it means. Is it yes, is it no?

622
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,724
I can't feel my right elbow anymore.

623
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:16,633
- I don't even know why, but I can't. 
- David.

624
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,082
Please, just tell me.

625
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,133
- I'm so tired. 
- It's not from the bible.

626
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:24,180
- What? 
- It's Shakespeare, Henry VI.

627
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:25,971
I like to goof off now and then, too, you know.

628
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:27,417
Shakespeare.

629
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,355
That is a very difficult this to do, reading the bible in one night.

630
00:30:30,457 --> 00:30:32,275
I myself have only done it three times.

631
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,419
You need great determination and excellent light.

632
00:30:35,854 --> 00:30:37,282
I'm very impressed.

633
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,155
- All right. 
- All right what?

634
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,285
You can go to the prom, but you cannot get married.

635
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:47,266
- That seems fair to me. 
- And me!

636
00:30:48,537 --> 00:30:50,738
The person who is going upstairs to think about what she's done.

637
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:55,122
Lane is grounded until the prom and for two months after.

638
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,671
You may call her on the phone every other day

639
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,493
for ten minutes and that is all. Understand?

640
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:02,229
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mrs. Kim.

641
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:07,973
Lane!

642
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,377
Thinking about what I've done!

643
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:19,326
So apparently we're all supposed to walk like Fran.

644
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:20,268
It's almost four.

645
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:24,026
Okay, I've gotta take some initiative here.

646
00:31:24,385 --> 00:31:24,963
What are you doing?

647
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:28,235
Just focus on the ground and look lost in grief.

648
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:34,891
It was a nice service.

649
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:36,488
- Yes. 
- Yes.

650
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,991
And this is a really nice idea, the walk around the square.

651
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:41,988
Oh, yeah, a great idea.

652
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:47,390
I may steal it when I die. You know, ask them to walk me around a benefit counter.

653
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,715
Might freak out the makeover girls, but it's...

654
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:50,927
- It's nice. 
- Really nice.

655
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,744
So listen, my name is Lorelai Gilmore

656
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,248
and this is Sookie St. James.

657
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:02,157
I know this isn't exactly the best time for this,

658
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:04,184
but we were wondering if you had any idea

659
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,172
what's going to happen with the Dragonfly.

660
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:07,257
Because we want it!

661
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:10,176
Sookie and I actually talked to Fran about buying it once.

662
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,064
We work in the Independence Inn now.

663
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:13,355
The one that burned down?

664
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:16,442
Yes, but that was just an accident. It was a bad wire.

665
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:17,988
A bad, bad wire.

666
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,943
It could've happened to anyone and should in no way reflect our inn-running abilities.

667
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:24,118
Yes, do you think we could discuss this a little later?

668
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:26,478
This is a little heavy and I sort of need to focus.

669
00:32:26,627 --> 00:32:28,270
Oh, let me help you here.

670
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:31,532
Ooh, wow, for a little woman... Sookie, will you just...

671
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:33,313
Oh, right.

672
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:37,896
Anyway, we were just wondering, did she leave the Dragonfly to anyone?

673
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:39,545
No, she didn't.

674
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:42,581
Oh, okay. And do you know what the family wants to do with it?

675
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,327
We haven't talked in depth about it, but I'm pretty sure they're gonna sell it.

676
00:32:45,557 --> 00:32:47,614
Well, we would really like to buy it.

677
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:50,094
- And keep it as an inn. 
- Yes, a wonderful inn.

678
00:32:50,237 --> 00:32:53,027
- Dedicated to Fran. 
- Yes, but keep it the Dragonfly.

679
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,841
And we promise not to burn it down.

680
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:57,943
Oh, yes, that's right. Hey, we could put that in the agreement. Ow...

681
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,322
- Here, why don't you... 
- Thank you.

682
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,455
- Anyway, what do you say? 
- Well...

683
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:06,453
Excuse me, but you're blocking her view.

684
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:09,191
Oh, sorry Kirk, sorry. So you were saying?

685
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,499
I'll tell you what, you contact me on Monday

686
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,938
and we can discuss this.

687
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:17,093
As far as I'm concerned, if the check clears, it's all yours.

688
00:33:18,812 --> 00:33:20,743
- It's all ours. 
- It's all ours.

689
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:33,755
We're closed. Learn to read.

690
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:38,188
You're the loser coffee guy.

691
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:40,887
Well, not as cool as Bono, but I'll take it.

692
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,194
- We're...
- Closed. Yeah, I heard.

693
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:47,087
- Okay, so we're still...
- I'm your father.

694
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:50,656
- closed. What? 
- I'm your...

695
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,900
- Are you sure? 
- Am I... yes, I'm sure.

696
00:33:57,984 --> 00:34:01,266
I didn't mean to spring this on you. I thought Luke would've told you that I...

697
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:02,310
Luke would've told me?

698
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,167
Well, yeah, he came to see me last night. He didn't tell you.

699
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:08,214
That's obvious because you're still doing the staring with the frown and...

700
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,470
you look different.

701
00:34:17,774 --> 00:34:19,392
- You want some coffee? 
- Sure.

702
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:29,954
Thanks.

703
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:32,176
It's old.

704
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:08,777
I gotta go.

705
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:23,019
- I was negotiating at a funeral. 
- I saw.

706
00:35:23,285 --> 00:35:25,379
Which might've been the most inappropriate thing to happen today

707
00:35:25,477 --> 00:35:28,693
until that gnat flew into Kirk's mouth and he freaked and dropped the casket.

708
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,696
It was a nice save.

709
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:31,441
I'm feeling so weird.

710
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:36,598
I'm completely sad about Fran, but the inn... it's really gonna happen.

711
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:37,745
Yeah, seems like it.

712
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:41,354
Hey, come here.

713
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:46,823
That one would look great on you.

714
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:47,776
Oh, I don't know.

715
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:49,086
We should come back tomorrow and try it on.

716
00:35:49,184 --> 00:35:51,073
- Maybe. 
- Hey, prom's coming up, kid.

717
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:53,658
We need to get you a dress. Unless you want me to make you one.

718
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:54,569
No, that's okay.

719
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:57,279
Maybe we could hit the mall tomorrow after school.

720
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,009
I could meet you in Hartford and we could go to a fancy store

721
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:01,564
where they'll follow us around like we're thieves.

722
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,269
I don't wanna talk about dresses anymore.

723
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:05,030
We've only been talking about dresses for two minutes.

724
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,048
- Well, it feels like longer. 
- Rory.

725
00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:08,595
And I don't know if I even need a dress, okay,

726
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,248
'cause I don't even know if I'm going to the prom.

727
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:12,957
- I thought Jess agreed. 
- Well, that was before.

728
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,534
- Before what? 
- Before the party,

729
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:16,572
before the fight, before the thing in Kyle's bedroom.

730
00:36:16,695 --> 00:36:17,601
Okay, come with me.

731
00:36:24,273 --> 00:36:27,218
Okay, we left off with the thing in Kyle's bedroom.

732
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,362
I don't understand. One minute he's happy, then he's not.

733
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:31,011
And he doesn't tell me anything ever.

734
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,844
I mean, you're supposed to tell your girlfriend things.

735
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,703
That's the whole point of having a girlfriend, isn't it?

736
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:36,796
Yes, it is. Now, Kyle's bedroom, what happened there?

737
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:40,223
And I'm so tired of fighting. Or not even fighting because he won't fight.

738
00:36:40,306 --> 00:36:42,951
He just gets mad and disappears and then comes back

739
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,379
and I don't like how I feel and I don't like what I do.

740
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:47,607
Like what you do where, in Kyle's bedroom?

741
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,075
I don't wanna feel like this, I don't wanna sit around wondering

742
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,205
when we're going to talk, if he's mad, why he's mad.

743
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:53,746
I hate this. I really, really...

744
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,148
Honey, you gotta tell Mommy what happened in Kyle's bedroom!

745
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:58,876
Jess was upset and I went to look for him and we were kissing

746
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,187
and then it seemed like he wanted to...

747
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:03,399
- Did you? 
- No, I didn't.

748
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:05,442
And then he got all weird like he was mad at me.

749
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:08,580
Hey, if he was mad at you because you wouldn't have sex with him,

750
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:10,091
- then he's a jerk. 
- I know that,

751
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:13,153
but I don't even know if that's why he's mad at me. I don't know if he's mad at me.

752
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:14,837
I don't know anything because he won't talk.

753
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:17,298
He just sulks then disappears, and just when you're through with him,

754
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,665
he shows up at hockey games with Distiller tickets.

755
00:37:19,757 --> 00:37:20,490
Distiller tickets?

756
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:24,238
What Distiller tickets?

757
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,192
Oh, that's right, you don't know about that because I didn't tell you

758
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:29,373
because I was embarrassed because I didn't wanna be that girl

759
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,506
and you don't want me to be that girl, but after the hockey game, I was that girl.

760
00:37:32,615 --> 00:37:34,310
What girl? Help me, drag me along, honey.

761
00:37:34,412 --> 00:37:36,239
The girl who lets her boyfriend treat her like dirt

762
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:37,612
and then lies to her mom about it.

763
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,840
Okay, you need a breath here.

764
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:45,261
Something's going on with him and it's been going on for awhile.

765
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:48,724
You can't make him talk, Rory. He has to want to.

766
00:37:48,872 --> 00:37:49,977
But why doesn't he want to?

767
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:51,917
Because it's probably hard for him.

768
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:55,948
Hey, we're not leaving. We're gonna live in this car

769
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:58,082
and we're gonna die in this car, so find another frickin' spot.

770
00:38:02,466 --> 00:38:04,407
- Honey... 
- I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

771
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:08,528
I'm tired of talking about it. I'm just... tired.

772
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:18,908
So...

773
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:20,955
- Nothing happened. 
- Okay.

774
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:27,171
You hungry? I can make us some eggs.

775
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:29,137
So I hear you went to see my father last night.

776
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:32,788
Yeah, I did.

777
00:38:33,618 --> 00:38:35,096
- Were you gonna tell me? 
- He came by?

778
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:37,002
- He came by. 
- I didn't think he'd have the guts.

779
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:40,869
- So what were you thinking? 
- Jess, I don't like your father very much.

780
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:43,714
So because you don't like him, that means I can't know he's here?

781
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,701
- You know he's here. 
- No thanks to you.

782
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,406
Shouldn't have come from me in the first place.

783
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:50,335
So what, you don't think you owed it to me to tell me, prepare me?

784
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,783
No, Jess, I didn't. With everything that's going on here with you,

785
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:55,477
I kinda hoped he'd just walk away, but...

786
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,482
once again, Jimmy makes the wrong move. What a shock.

787
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:00,550
Who the hell are you to decide what the right move is?

788
00:39:00,945 --> 00:39:03,286
I'm the one who's saving your ass constantly.

789
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,814
I'm the one who just wrote a check to Kyle's father

790
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:08,047
so he wouldn't press charges against you.

791
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,276
I'm the one trying to knock some sense into that thick head of yours about the future.

792
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:15,656
- Oh, here we go. 
- You don't take anything seriously.

793
00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:17,577
That's why you're doing so crappy in school.

794
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:20,330
You're smart enough, you read more than anyone I've ever seen.

795
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:23,233
There's no reason why you should be barely graduating.

796
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:24,759
- I'm not. 
- You're not what?

797
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:26,745
- I'm not graduating. 
- Yes, you are.

798
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:27,909
- No, I'm not. 
- Yes, you are.

799
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:29,255
- No, I'm not. 
- Yes, you are,

800
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:31,452
because we had an agreement that if you were gonna live here,

801
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:33,536
you were gonna go to school and you were gonna graduate.

802
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:35,246
Well, I didn't and I'm not.

803
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:39,174
What is wrong with you? What, did you do this just to spite me?

804
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,502
- Look, forget it, it's done. 
- What's your life now?

805
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,499
Wal-Mart full time, that's your great future?

806
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,290
Gonna take the plunge and buy yourself a second blue vest?

807
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:49,336
Maybe, why not? What's wrong with it? I mean, it's no diner.

808
00:39:49,445 --> 00:39:52,434
Hey, I own this business, kid! I built it, this is mine!

809
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:55,031
I'm not at the mercy of some boss waiting and hoping

810
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:58,824
to be chosen employee of the month for a couple extra hundred bucks and a plaque.

811
00:39:58,953 --> 00:40:00,217
I'm always employee of the month.

812
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:02,915
I'm employee of the year, of the century, of the universe.

813
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:05,200
You should be so lucky to have a job like mine.

814
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:11,938
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

815
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:15,364
You're gonna live here one more year, you're gonna quit you job,

816
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:19,260
you're gonna take twelfth grade over again, and you will graduate.

817
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:20,928
- No. 
- I'm not playing with you here, Jess.

818
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,428
You quit your job, you go to school.

819
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:26,095
- I am not going back to school! 
- So that's it?

820
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,319
Yeah, that's it.

821
00:40:28,503 --> 00:40:29,787
Then you gotta go.

822
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,728
I thought I smelled coffee.

823
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,211
Good morning your highness. I trust you slept well.

824
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:47,499
And to what do I owe this lovely display of domesticity?

825
00:40:47,642 --> 00:40:50,304
Well, being brilliant and all, I figured you would probably still not be

826
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:52,173
in the mood to go to Luke's this morning,

827
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:54,144
so I thought we'd have a nice little breakfast here.

828
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:54,969
Wow, okay.

829
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:56,423
- Hey. 
- Good?

830
00:40:56,649 --> 00:40:58,291
- These are from Luke's. 
- What?

831
00:40:58,493 --> 00:41:00,668
You got up this morning, went to Luke's and brought this back.

832
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:02,118
I sure as hell am not gonna cook.

833
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:03,597
They're good, thank you.

834
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,000
Put 'em on a plate just the way you like 'em.

835
00:41:05,752 --> 00:41:06,770
Well, there it is.

836
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:11,318
"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Lister announce the engagement of their daughter

837
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:14,630
Lindsay Ann to Dean Forrester, son of Randy and Barbara Forrester."

838
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,720
My God, they're a good looking couple.

839
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:18,419
If their kids can sing there's no stopping 'em.

840
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:20,601
I still don't understand why they need to get married.

841
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,371
Maybe they have to get married before he grows so tall

842
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:24,867
she won't be able to talk to him anymore.

843
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,352
I really do want him to be happy.

844
00:41:26,504 --> 00:41:28,634
I know. You're good in that department.

845
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:31,662
Some people get married young and everything turns out fine.

846
00:41:31,804 --> 00:41:33,724
- Absolutely. 
- That'd be nice.

847
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:35,338
Well, we'll keep a good thought.

848
00:41:35,752 --> 00:41:38,523
Hey, here's a picture of Kirk pinned by the casket.

849
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:39,858
Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

850
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:42,992
Man, it's bad enough this had to happen, but his pants splitting on top of it?

851
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:45,880
Yeah. I hope he never takes too close a look at his life.

852
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:47,826
Amen. So this goes on the fridge, right?

853
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,632
- Yeah, absolutely. 
- Good.

854
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,767
- Can I sit? 
- Sure, sit.

855
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:25,185
I thought you took an earlier bus.

856
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,000
My first class got canceled today.

857
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,606
So what's been going on?

858
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,521
- Nothing much. Fran died. 
- I heard.

859
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:37,873
- I went to her funeral yesterday. 
- Luke went, too.

860
00:42:38,748 --> 00:42:40,197
- I saw him there. 
- Yeah?

861
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:41,124
He was in the back.

862
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,422
I can't go to the prom.

863
00:42:52,394 --> 00:42:53,536
I couldn't get tickets.

864
00:42:57,606 --> 00:42:58,170
Sorry.

865
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,681
- This is my stop. 
- Okay.

866
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:08,405
So, you'll call me?

867
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:10,581
Yeah, I'll call you.

868
