1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,005
I hate crossword puzzles.
They make me feel stupid.

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,841
- Then don't do them.
- If you don't, you're not only stupid...

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:08,926
you're also a coward.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
- Or you have better things to do.
- You think people will buy that?

5
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,807
The people who line up on a daily basis
and ask if you do crossword puzzles...

6
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,060
and then when you say no,
challenge you as to why?

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,687
- Yes, I think they will buy it.
- Look, new bagboy.

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,649
That's Marty. He's subbing for Dean
while he's out of town.

9
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:27,110
Marty does the jar twirl
before putting the salsa in the bag.

10
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,738
- Impressive. Very Cocktail.
- Marty's a nice guy.

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,449
- Marty's an ambitious snake in the grass.
- What?

12
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,201
The jar twirl. The double-bagging.

13
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,912
The 'Have a nice day, ma'am,'
after every customer.

14
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,539
That guy's got an agenda.

15
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,749
- Which is?
- He's out to take Dean's job.

16
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,293
- I don't think so.
- Yes, he is.

17
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,254
I'm telling you. He wants that position.

18
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,799
Dean better hurry from his grandmother's
or he can kiss his job goodbye.

19
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,051
- They're not going to fire Dean.
- Why not?

20
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,221
For starters,
someone stole Taylor's ladder last week...

21
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,890
and Dean is the only one
who can reach the top shelves.

22
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,851
- Interesting.
- What?

23
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:04,064
Just as Marty, a. k. a. Eve Harrington,
shows up trying to take Dean's job...

24
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,860
Taylor's ladder mysteriously disappears
suddenly making Dean invaluable...

25
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,488
no matter what fancy tricks
Lon Chaney Jr. Over there pulls.

26
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,284
Good thinking, Dean.
Smart thinking, my friend.

27
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,661
You need to start napping
in the afternoons.

28
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,162
Taylor, pulling double duty today?

29
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,790
I like to fill in behind the register
every now and then.

30
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,834
Keeps me in contact with the clientele.

31
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,129
Also, it allows me to keep an eye
on the 'Take a Penny' pot here...

32
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,632
make sure people aren't pocketing
the pennies for their personal gain...

33
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,552
but are legitimately using them
to make exact change.

34
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,387
Cool. Mom, look.

35
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,681
Yeah, it's
'Movie in the Square' night again.

36
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,974
- Great.
- We'll be there.

37
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,643
- Excellent. There you are.
- What's the movie this year?

38
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,062
- Something really great.
- Really? What?

39
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,647
- A real winner.
- What's it called?

40
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,817
- Show up and be surprised.
- What don't you tell me what it is?

41
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,569
- No.
- Why not?

42
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,280
- Because.
- Because why? What is the...

43
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,869
- There is a line behind you.
- You chose The Yearling again?

44
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,582
It is a fine, wholesome motion picture.
Moving story. Lovely scenes of nature.

45
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,210
You've shown The Yearling
the last three years in a row.

46
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:10,255
I'm getting a little tired of hearing you
complain about this every single year.

47
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,090
I'm tired, too. Pick another movie.

48
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:16,053
A lot of hard work and careful planning
go into those nights. You never help plan.

49
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,097
You never volunteer.
You have never once been a ticket ripper...

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,642
as long as I have been involved
in that function.

51
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:25,604
Personally, missy, if you can't participate
with a smile and a hug...

52
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,941
- then you shouldn't participate at all.
- I shouldn't, but I am.

53
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,943
- Pick another movie.
- No.

54
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,861
There's millions of great movies out there.

55
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,989
Any one would be better
than The Yearling for the fourth time.

56
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,783
Fine! You do it!

57
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,493
- What?
- You pick the movie!

58
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,078
- Seriously?
- I've had it.

59
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,330
You have such strong opinions
about everything...

60
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,042
you go out and try to find a movie
that everybody will enjoy.

61
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,463
It's all yours. I relinquish
my movie-picking crown to you!

62
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,425
- He relinquished his crown!
- I heard.

63
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,719
- I got his crown!
- And it looks great on you.

64
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,179
Cool! This is gonna be fun.

65
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,974
Let's go home and make popcorn
and pick which movie we want.

66
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,392
- I get to help?
- Of course.

67
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,728
- And can I borrow the crown?
- I don't know, honey. We'll have to see.

68
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,036
- Wizard of Oz.
- The Sting.

69
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,871
- Rocky.
- Crimes and Misdemeanors.

70
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,915
- The Singing Detective.
- That's a miniseries.

71
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,541
- So?
- It's like six hours long.

72
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,127
- Good point. I got it. Arthur.
- Yes.

73
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,588
- Or Sophie's Choice.
- Very similar.

74
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,757
I can't choose.
There's too many great movies.

75
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,925
The burden is overwhelming.

76
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,928
I'm sinking under the pressure.
My grasp on reality is slipping.

77
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,223
I can't do it, I just can't...
How about Cabin Boy?

78
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,265
- Will you get that?
- No.

79
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,350
- Why not?
- Time?

80
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,601
- 6:45.
- On?

81
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,061
Wednesday.

82
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,483
- Dad, hi.
- Kiddo, what's going on?

83
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,861
Not much. Just getting ready for school
and trying to think up movies.

84
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,614
- Movies for what?
- Our town does this big movie festival...

85
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,783
and this year Mom gets to pick the movie.

86
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,244
- How'd she get that gig?
- She ticked off the guy...

87
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,038
- that usually does it and he quit.
- Sounds about right.

88
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,748
How are things? How's Sherrie?

89
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:53,168
Nothing much is going on here.
Same old, same old.

90
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,255
Listen, I've got to cut this talk short...

91
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,882
but I sent you an e-mail, so read it.

92
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,885
And add 40 minutes onto my tab
for next week's call.

93
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,178
- Deal?
- Deal.

94
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:07,099
- You want to talk to Mom before you go?
- No, I can't.

95
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,685
I really need to run. You say hello for me.

96
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,937
- Okay.
- I'll talk to you Wednesday.

97
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,981
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Dad.

98
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,066
- He says hello.
- He does not.

99
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,819
Are you going to tell me
what you two are fighting about?

100
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,903
We're not fighting.

101
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,824
What you're not fighting about
that keeps you from talking to each other?

102
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,910
- How about Desperately Seeking Susan?
- How about My Mother is Two?

103
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,288
- Never saw it. Angie Dickinson?
- You're impossible.

104
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,999
Right. You're Impossible
was the one with Angie Dickinson.

105
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,710
Fine. Forget it. I give.
Stay in a fight. I don't care.

106
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,795
I'm late for school. We'll finish this later.

107
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,714
- After school, Luke's?
- I'll be there.

108
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,340
- Bye, hon.
- Bye.

109
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,480
Fifteen minutes left.

110
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,498
Lane.

111
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,877
- I need a pencil.
- I don't have one.

112
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,546
- Then I need a pen.
- You only have 15 minutes left.

113
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,132
- Then I need the answers.
- There's a pen in my bag.

114
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,301
- I can't go through your bag.
- Yes, you can.

115
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,845
My mother told me
never to go through a lady's bag...

116
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,681
at least not until
you're a couple blocks away.

117
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,644
Just kidding. She never said that. Though
it sounds like good advice, doesn't it?

118
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,188
- Take it and shut up.
- Boy, I tell you, it's true...

119
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,398
small towns sure are friendly.

120
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,579
Come in.

121
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:58,126
I got a call you wanted to see me.
I'm Luke Danes, Jess Mariano's uncle.

122
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,921
Jess Mariano? Yes...

123
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,590
- Come in.
- Thanks.

124
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,345
Is everything okay? I didn't see
any cop cars or fire trucks out front so...

125
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,139
- Mr. Danes, please, have a seat.
- A seat.

126
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,767
So this is a seat thing.

127
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,566
- What's he done?
- Why do you think he's done something?

128
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,944
You're staring at a folder
that's looking a little thick there...

129
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,613
I get a call to come over and talk to you.

130
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,699
So why don't you just tell me
what he's done?

131
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,783
Nothing.

132
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,911
- Nothing?
- No homework, no class participation.

133
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,788
His attendance record is erratic at best.

134
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,833
His attitude to his teachers
ranges from indifferent to hostile.

135
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,377
He shows no interest in activities
or other students...

136
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,880
and there is the issue
of the disappearing baseballs.

137
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,590
- The what?
- Every baseball on campus...

138
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,594
- seems to have disappeared.
- You don't think Jess seriously...

139
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,264
- I'll check when I get home.
- I appreciate that.

140
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,768
I don't suspect we'll solve
every problem in one meeting...

141
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,771
so let's focus on the most important one:

142
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,231
His grades.

143
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,733
- Not good?
- Not good.

144
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,445
- I'll have a talk with him about that.
- You have to do more than talk.

145
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,238
- You have to help him.
- Me?

146
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,241
No, I'm not the one you want helping him.

147
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,411
I went to this school.
I'm sure there's a note stuffed in there...

148
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,623
about me with the words 'Trade SchooI'
stamped in big letters.

149
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,459
If you can't help,
you have to find someone who can.

150
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,294
- Like who?
- A relative.

151
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,631
I don't think so.
Believe me, I'm the Einstein of the clan.

152
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,257
Maybe you need to hire a tutor.

153
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,634
A tutor?

154
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,055
Jess is flunking out.
He's not going to make it.

155
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:37,309
If something is not done about that
right now, he's going to repeat this year.

156
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,438
- I'm sorry, but that's where we are.
- Okay, if that's where we are...

157
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,858
- then I'll just have to figure something out.
- Good.

158
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,363
- Let's not forget about those baseballs.
- Right.

159
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,449
Been using tennis balls
for a couple of weeks.

160
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,285
- Very different results.
- I'm sure it is.

161
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,834
If we take off Fletch and Urban Cowboy...

162
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,462
we still have 75 possibilities.

163
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,173
- How are we gonna pick just one?
- I don't know.

164
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,175
Maybe we should do
a movie marathon weekend.

165
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,427
Show one movie
after the other for three days...

166
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,805
charge a fortune,
gouge them on bottled water...

167
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,851
have really disgusting bathrooms.
It'll be like our own Woodstock.

168
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,186
Good. There you are.

169
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,730
- I have something for you.
- What?

170
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,941
- This.
- Jeez.

171
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,569
When you get through this
and make your decision...

172
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,572
the number of the man you need
to contact is on the first page.

173
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:32,739
What man? What is this?

174
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:36,618
The list of titles that are available
for you to pick from for the movie night.

175
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:37,995
The list of titles?

176
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,331
- I'm sorry, can't we pick our own movie?
- You're not serious?

177
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,792
Not often, but just there,
I had some serious going.

178
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,003
My dear girl, movies are expensive...

179
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,089
and we get fabulous deals
with this particular place.

180
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,675
They have a wide selection
and they're very friendly...

181
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,385
and since it all goes to charity...

182
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,722
they agree to give us anything
on that list for free.

183
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,475
- So we have to pick a movie off this list?
- It's fun.

184
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,978
They put the movie title over here...

185
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,397
and a brief description
of the storyline over here.

186
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,359
And believe me, there are
some excellent movies on that list. Really.

187
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,278
- Top notch.
- Arctic Flight.

188
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,197
'Man with plane flies charter to Alaska...

189
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,116

192
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,040
Don't I wish!

193
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,502
Okay, I can't wait to see
what you come up with.

194
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,961
Bye, girls.

195
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,089
'Killer Shark. Shark fishermen on ocean.

196
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,675

206
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,913
Listen, have you seen Jess?

207
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:06,458
- I think I saw him go upstairs earlier.
- Great. Thanks.

208
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,045
Good, you're here.

209
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,347
So, you file those under the band names?

210
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,974
- Genre.
- Right. Genre.

211
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,477
That makes sense. Makes a lot of sense.

212
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,401
- What is that? Something for school?
- No.

213
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,320
- Shouldn't you read something for school?
- Why?

214
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,197
I mean, I know you like reading.

215
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,492
Since you like it, you might read
something you'll get graded on...

216
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,412
so you can get graded on
something you like...

217
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,123
because you like reading.

218
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:49,835
- What are you babbling about?
- I went to see your principal today.

219
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,548
He says you're flunking out.
He says you're not showing up for class.

220
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,010
He says you stole their baseballs.

221
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,637
You stole their baseballs?
Why would you do that?

222
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,557
What could you possible need
500 baseballs for?

223
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,559
Could we talk about this later?

224
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,353
Why, you got a big Frisbee heist
going down at 6:00?

225
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,273
Jess, Mr. Merton said
if you don't start doing better...

226
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,025
they're not gonna let you be a senior.

227
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,401
- Bummer.
- They'll hold you back.

228
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,445
At least I'll know where my classes are.

229
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,572
Jess, this is serious. You're flunking out!

230
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,116
You may be in the 11th grade
for the rest of your life!

231
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,119
You'll be the kid in the back
with a beard and a racing form...

232
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:27,039
babbling incoherently about Steely Dan.

233
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,626
The group may change.
The freak in the back never does.

234
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,836
- I'm going out.
- Don't you wanna go to college?

235
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,214
- Don't wait up.
- What will you be when you grow up?

236
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,009
- About 20 miles south of where you are.
- You have to think about the future.

237
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,553
If you don't get through high school,
who'll hire you?

238
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,679
You won't have any skills.

239
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,557
- Stop.
- How are you gonna work, eat, pay rent?

240
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,808
What are you gonna do?

241
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,603
Jeez, I don't know.
Maybe I'll work in a diner.

242
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,197
- Marshmallow?
- Thank you.

243
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,286
I have now finished going through
every single one of these movies.

244
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,664
I've read them, reviewed their merits...

245
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,417
and I'm proud to announce
that I have chosen our movie.

246
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,045
- How does The Yearling sound to you?
- Perfect.

247
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,421
And bye-bye.

248
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,967
That must be Pauline Kael
rising from the dead.

249
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,426
Tell her, 'Hey. '

250
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,138
- Pauline!
- What?

251
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,765
Never mind. What are you doing here?

252
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:30,185
I made some brownies.
I thought you might like some.

253
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,689
Since I just ate a half-bag
of marshmallows, six Pop-Tarts...

254
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,899
four bagel dogs
and a really stale Cheese Nip...

255
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,943
it's brownie time. Thanks.

256
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,320
- Here's a question for you.
- Yeah?

257
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,615
You probably have a diner full of people
who'd love these brownies.

258
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,450
Plus, I bet they'd pay you for them.

259
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,079
I accidentally dropped triple the amount
of cocoa powder in the batter...

260
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,832
so I either had to dump the batch
or find someone...

261
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,502
with superhuman chocolate tolerance.
Only one name came to mind.

262
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,963
God, I love being special.

263
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,133
- What?
- Nothing, I just...

264
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,011
Is Rory here, by any chance?

265
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,305
- She's in her room.
- Can I talk to her for a sec?

266
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,640
- Sure. Go right ahead.
- Thanks.

267
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,646
Rory, it's Luke. Can I come in for a minute?

268
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,443
- What's up?
- Not much. Can I...

269
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,987
Yeah. Come on in.

270
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,499
I see you're studying. That's good.

271
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,375
Studying is very, very good.

272
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,504
What you're doing right there
with the books, very good.

273
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:39,963
Thank you.

274
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,842
I wanted to ask you a favor.

275
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,601
- I was wondering if you could tutor Jess.
- What?

276
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,230
He's not doing well in school. The principal
says he's not gonna move on...

277
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,399
unless something changes.
I was wondering if you could help.

278
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,486
That doesn't make sense.
He's smart enough to pass any subject.

279
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,154
It's not his lack of smarts.

280
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:08,450
More like his lack of proximity
to the actual classes. That's the problem.

281
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,870
What subject does he need help in?

282
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,872
I'd say all of them, probably.

283
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,333
I don't expect you to work miracles...

284
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,877
and it doesn't have to be
a full-time, everyday thing.

285
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,630
If you could get him through
a couple of his next tests...

286
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,550
maybe make the school
see that he can do it...

287
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,135
that would probably help out a lot.

288
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,262
Sure.

289
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,555
- Great. Tonight?
- Tonight...

290
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,765
I really appreciate this.

291
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,562
You should get back to your studying.

292
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,106
Otherwise,
you're completely useless to me.

293
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,113
I'll see you guys at dinner, probably.

294
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,240
Wait. Hold on. What was that all about?

295
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,659
Rory's gonna tutor Jess.

296
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,870
- She is?
- Yeah. Just for a little while.

297
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,788
Help get him on the right track.

298
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,958
Okay. I should be getting back.
Enjoy the brownies.

299
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,752
I'll see if I can screw up a cake
for you later on.

300
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,337
Sounds great.

301
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,179
Luke, hang on just a sec.

302
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,099
Listen, about Rory
doing this tutoring thing...

303
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,726
I really appreciate it, by the way.

304
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,769
I know, I just... Rory's so sweet...

305
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,189
and she'd never say no
'cause she loves to help...

306
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,274
- but I'm not sure if it's the best idea.
- Why?

307
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,193
She's got her own studies to worry about.

308
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,946
I know. I promise this won't take up
all her time. It's for a little while.

309
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,365
- Okay, but...
- Rory's pretty serious about school.

310
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,701
She wouldn't say
she had the time if she didn't.

311
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,912
Rory is a great student,
but she's just a kid.

312
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,289
Don't you need a professional tutor
to help Jess?

313
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:41,126
Somebody with a degree, a pipe and one
of those coats with elbow patches on it?

314
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,253
I need someone Jess is gonna listen to.

315
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,839
Someone he's gonna,
I don't know, look up to.

316
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:49,218
That sure isn't me, and it sure isn't
some tutor. He likes Rory...

317
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:53,597
and Rory's on the path that I'd like
to see Jess on: School and college.

318
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,142
He needs to see somebody he respects
doing what he should be doing.

319
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,103
Rory's the only one I can think of
who fits that description.

320
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,941
- You don't know that he'll listen to Rory.
- But I gotta do something, don't I?

321
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,443
What would you do if you were me?

322
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,488
Just make sure
it's not too much time, okay?

323
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,864
- I will.
- Okay.

324
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,616
Enjoy the brownie.

325
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,250
My God.

326
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,336
That's good.

327
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:30,843
- I need one minute of your time.
- I'll give you two because you scare me.

328
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,345
I hear through the grapevine
that you are in charge...

329
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,472
of selecting the movie for the movie night.

330
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,391
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.

331
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:42,563
I don't know if you know this about me,
but I have great creative ambitions.

332
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,023
- I did not know that about you, Kirk.
- It's true.

333
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,234
Don't get me wrong,
I love the blue-collar work.

334
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,111
I enjoy the plight of the everyman.

335
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:53,115
But as much as the mailed letter delivered
and the DSL line installed...

336
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:57,244
the latest J. Lo flick rented
fills me with a deep sense of pride...

337
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:01,665
- in my soul, I am Akira Kurosawa.
- Seven Samurai. Great movie.

338
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,375
- Excuse me?
- Seven Samurai.

339
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,712
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- Akira Kurosawa directed Seven Samurai.

340
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,381
- It's a great Japanese movie.
- Japanese movie?

341
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,010
I'm sorry, I have the wrong person.

342
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,470
Who's the guy who directed
The Facts of Life?

343
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,514
- I don't...
- Asaad Kelada. Sorry.

344
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:20,184
In my soul, I know I am Asaad Kelada.

345
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,560
What do you need?

346
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,771
I've made a short film
that I've been working on for five years.

347
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,983
If I rush, I can have it done by Thursday.
I'm very proud of it.

348
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:31,111
I was wondering if you would screen it
before the movie tomorrow.

349
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,946
It would mean a great deal to my career.

350
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,408
- What kind of movie is it?
- You mean, is it 'blue'?

351
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,411
No. Perfectly PG. It's not exactly Babe.

352
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,079
- More like Babe 2.
- Got it.

353
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,707
- Same pig. Harder edge.
- I hear you. I want to help.

354
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,876
Let me think about it,
and I'll get back to you.

355
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,587
Here's a copy of the film.
Take a look and call me.

356
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,799
And remember, I can edit out two of the
'hells,' but I need to keep all the 'damns. '

357
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:55,260
- It's a street-cred thing.
- Bye, Kirk.

358
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,430
At least now I have
something fun to do tonight.

359
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,767
- You're not watching that without me.
- Okay, I'll wait.

360
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,438
- Do you want to get some pie?
- No, I'm full.

361
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,524
- How about some coffee?
- I'm good.

362
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,025
- Hot chocolate?
- No, thanks.

363
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,151
Egg cream?

364
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:14,988
I never had an egg cream, but it sounds
just disgusting enough to be fabulous.

365
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,365
We're just going to study.

366
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,617
- I know.
- And we'll be right here doing it.

367
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,245
So this stalling is completely unnecessary.

368
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,913
- So go.
- I will.

369
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,086
Just finishing up the coffee that I paid for.

370
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,007
All right, that's enough. I'm going. Bye.

371
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,596
Mom? Listen, just in case,
and I don't think he will...

372
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,765
if Dean calls,
will you tell him I'm with Lane?

373
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,475
- I thought this was nothing.
- It is.

374
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,185
- That you were just studying.
- We are.

375
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,478
Then how come I have to lie?

376
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,607
You know that it's not gonna be okay
with Dean if I'm studying with Jess.

377
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,861
Maybe you shouldn't,
if you feel weird enough that I have to lie.

378
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:57,322
- I'm not asking you to lie.
- You told me to say that you're with Lane.

379
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,783
I don't see Lane here. Sounds like a lie.

380
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,870
- Forget it. Just don't answer the phone.
- Hello? I get calls, too.

381
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,539
I'm not What Ever Happened
to Baby Jane? Yet, thank you.

382
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,125
Tell him that I'm studying,
which is what I am doing...

383
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,544
so you will not be lying, okay?

384
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,796
- Hey, Teach.
- Hey.

385
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,883
- You guys done yet?
- Just not yet.

386
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,343
I'll be right over there when you are.

387
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,888
Just can't wait for that learning to begin.

388
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,348
Are we gonna do some of those
Schoolhouse Rock songs?

389
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:26,560
- I'll be right there.
- They say if you make learning fun...

390
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:30,522
- Give us a minute, okay?
- Hurry, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

391
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,484
- I'll be home early.
- Fine.

392
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,821
Bye, Jess.

393
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,114
Ma'am.

394
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,914
- Are you ready to start?
- Yes, I am.

395
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,291
- Where are your books?
- I don't know.

396
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,668
- How are we going to study?
- I guess we can't.

397
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,004
- Too bad. So, what now? Movie?
- Get your books.

398
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,382
- The cat ate them.
- Get your books or I'm going home.

399
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,092
Wait there.

400
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,032
Explain to me the political ramifications
of the Marshall Plan.

401
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,575
Pick a card.

402
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:29,122
- That just made the trick a little bit harder.
- Jess, focus.

403
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,291
- Where's Dean tonight?
- We just went over this.

404
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,001
- There's no way you forgot.
- Work?

405
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:36,296
I will make you write it out 50 times
on the Specials board.

406
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,716
If he's not at work, he must be free.
He doesn't care that you're here?

407
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,343
No, he doesn't.

408
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,137
- He's visiting his grandmother.
- Where?

409
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,514
- Chicago.
- He doesn't know?

410
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,307
- It wouldn't matter.
- You'll tell him?

411
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,726
- We're studying.
- You're studying, I'm prying.

412
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:53,021
Jess, why won't you at least try
to remember the Marshall Plan?

413
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:57,150
Have you read Please Kill Me?
Oral history of the punk movement.

414
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:59,486
You'd like it.
You can borrow it if you want.

415
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,240
I'm here to help you study.
If you want me to go, I'll go.

416
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,160
But if I'm going to stay,
then you will stop distracting me...

417
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,162
and start paying attention, understand?

418
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,997
- I understand.
- Good.

419
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,293
And, yes, I would like to borrow it.
Thank you very much.

420
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,461
Now open your book.

421
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,015
Done.

422
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,561
- This isn't Shakespeare.
- It's not?

423
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:33,979
It's the words to a Clash song.

424
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,815
- But which Clash song?
- I'm not the one being tested.

425
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:37,941
Ten seconds.

426
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,569
- Nine, eight, seven...
- Stop it.

427
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:43,447
...six, five, four...
- You're really starting to...

428
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,616
...three...
- Guns of Brixton.

429
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:46,992
A- plus.

430
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,912
Why did you agree to this studying thing?

431
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,330
'Cause Luke said I had to.

432
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,665
You've never done anything
because someone said so.

433
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,752
- I moved because someone said I had to.
- Very different.

434
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,754
- Do you want to get out of here?
- What?

435
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:02,257
- I'm sick of studying.
- How can you be sick of studying?

436
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,092
You haven't done any studying.

437
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:06,512
You've done card tricks,
you've made coffee...

438
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,638
you've explained to me...

439
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,682
how on earth Coldplay
could be considered an alternative band...

440
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,684
but as of yet, no studying.

441
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:13,977
That's your car?

442
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,354
Yes, it is.

443
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:21,652
I'll tell you what, let's go get
some ice cream, when we get back...

444
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,196
- I'll study.
- This is a diner. There's ice cream here.

445
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,781
- But we don't have any cones.
- Cones.

446
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,700
- I need cones.
- So, if we go get ice cream...

447
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,078
- In cones.
- Then you'll be a perfect student...

448
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,288
- for the rest of the night?
- That's right.

449
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:36,458
I could not believe you less.
Here. You drive.

450
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:40,671
- I'll read you Othello. Won't that be fun?
- You have no idea how much.

451
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,344
Admit it, it's always better in a cone.

452
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,556
Putting ice cream in a dish?
Eating it with a spoon?

453
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,266
What is wrong with people?

454
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,059
- Hold the wheel.
- What?

455
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,604
- I'm dripping. Hold the wheel.
- I can't. You're driving.

456
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:01,733
The person who drives holds the wheel.
That's what they teach you in driver's ed.

457
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:04,528
I got to take that class one of these days.
Take the wheel.

458
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,072
- I'm letting go.
- Stop. Take it back.

459
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:10,534
You are taking this wheel back,
and when you do, I'm going to kill you.

460
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,620
- I'm just letting you know that.
- I appreciate the warning.

461
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,164
I got it.

462
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,958
Jeez, you look pale. You okay?

463
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,253
- Death. And it's going to be painful.
- You're not gonna kill me.

464
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:24,256
Think how dull your life
would be without me.

465
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,050
- Serious question?
- Okay.

466
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,678
You're smarter than almost everybody
at your school.

467
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,638
It takes you five minutes to finish a book.

468
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:35,559
You read and remember everything.
You could ace those classes easily.

469
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,227
Why don't you?

470
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:38,937
You don't need a tutor.

471
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,481
It's crazy that they're talking
about leaving you back.

472
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,275
- Whatever.
- You could do anything.

473
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,277
You could be anything you wanted.

474
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,362
Is it, like, a 'cooI' thing?

475
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:50,824
- I could care less about being cool.
- Inform me, please.

476
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,827
I'm never going to college.
Why waste time in high school?

477
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,288
- Why aren't you going to college?
- Please.

478
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,874
What? 'Please' what?
Why is that so crazy?

479
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,460
Ask my mother.
She could give you a couple reasons.

480
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:05,172
And I'm sure Principal Merton
can chime in with a few good ones.

481
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,634
In fact, ask your mother.
She doesn't know me all that well...

482
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,969
but I'm sure she could improvise
a few things.

483
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,554
Don't give me that whole...

484
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:15,015
'I'm so misunderstood,'
Kurt Cobain-y thing.

485
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,851
You are way stronger than that,
and I don't want to hear it.

486
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,646
- You have to go to college.
- No, you have to go to college.

487
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,689
Don't you have any plans?

488
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,983
- I plan to get out of Stars Hollow.
- And go where?

489
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,068
- Wherever.
- And do what?

490
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,819
- Whatever.
- 'Whenever. ' 'Whatever. '

491
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:30,364
I'll live where I live,
I'll work when I need money...

492
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,575
- and I'll see where I end up.
- You could do more.

493
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,495
- Here come the pompons.
- No pompons.

494
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,997
Just me saying, 'You could do more. '

495
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:45,087
- So, Courtney, what about you?
- What about me?

496
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,840
- What are your big ambitions?
- Harvard.

497
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,676
- And after Harvard?
- I'm gonna be a journalist.

498
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,095
- Paula Zahn?
- Christiane Amanpour.

499
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:54,847
- An overseas correspondent?
- Yes.

500
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,350
You're gonna crawl around in trenches
and stand on top of buildings...

501
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,602
and have bombs going off
in the background...

502
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,521
and civil wars raging all around you?

503
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,022
What? You don't think I can do it?

504
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:08,360
- No, I do. It just sounds a little too...
- A little what?

505
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,487
A little too rough for you.

506
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,031
It's not a little too rough for me.

507
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:19,121
I hope it's not a little too rough for me.
I've been talking about this forever.

508
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,873
I don't even know what I would do if...

509
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,793
I didn't mean to freak you out.
I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll do it.

510
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,546
You will. I promise.

511
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,382
I'll help you practice, okay?

512
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:34,011
Tomorrow, you'll stand in the middle
of the street, and I'll drive at you...

513
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,054
screaming in a foreign language.

514
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,515
You're gonna have to learn
a foreign language first.

515
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:41,393
It's lucky I've got me a tutor, isn't it?

516
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:51,445
So I guess we should be getting back.

517
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:54,531
I did promise to study
if you went on this ice-cream run with me.

518
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:57,910
- You did.
- I'll go straight, and we're back at Luke's.

519
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,912
Good sense of direction.

520
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,164
Of course, I could turn right...

521
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:05,751
then we'd just be driving around
in circles for a while.

522
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:11,507
- Turn right.
- As you wish.

523
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:27,648
Great. Was it the China Ball,
the China Doll or the China Wall...

524
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,483
that had the really good shrimp balls?

525
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,569
- I think it was the China Doll.
- Okay, these can go.

526
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:35,572
You'll be so proud of me.
I'm organizing the takeout drawer.

527
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:39,910
I'm weeding out the dogs, and I'm putting
happy-face stickers on the dishes...

528
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,788
that have been successes
to make our ordering more efficient.

529
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,289
- Where are you?
- Be calm.

530
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:47,417
- Calm about what?
- Calm about what I have to tell you.

531
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,586
- Where are you?
- I'm all right.

532
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,505
Of course. Why wouldn't you be all right?

533
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:55,050
- Because I got in an accident.
- What?

534
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,594
What accident? What do you mean?

535
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,639
Jess and I went for ice cream
and we were just driving...

536
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,433
and it was dark,
and this dog or cat or possum...

537
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:07,354
it was small and furry, it ran out into
the middle of the road and Jess swerved...

538
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,314
- Jess swerved? Jess was driving?
- Yes.

539
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,316
Jess was driving,
and you got in an accident?

540
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,653
But I'm fine, and he's fine.
And the furry thing is fine.

541
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,823
The car's a bit messed up,
but there's nothing to be worried about.

542
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,993
- Where are you?
- I'm in the hospital.

543
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:29,334
Hi, excuse me. My daughter's here.
She was in a car accident.

544
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,837
- Her name is Rory Gilmore.
- Okay, just take a seat.

545
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,548
- I don't want to take a seat.
- It'll be one minute.

546
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,008
Remember in Terms of Endearment...

547
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,010
where Shirley MacLaine's in the hospital...

548
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:40,137
and freaks when her daughter
doesn't get a shot?

549
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,014
She got that from me
and she toned it down.

550
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,350
So once again, I'm looking
for my daughter, Rory Gilmore.

551
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:48,520
- First door on your left.
- Thank you.

552
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,568
Good. Are you okay?

553
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,779
I'm fine. Please tell her that I'm fine.

554
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:59,907
- She's fine.
- What's with the wrapping?

555
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,244
- There's no wrapping if she's fine.
- Her arm hit the dashboard.

556
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,705
She sustained a minor hairline fracture
to her wrist.

557
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,790
- She broke her wrist?
- It's just a fracture.

558
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:12,336
- Let George Clooney talk here.
- It's a tiny fracture. Nothing serious.

559
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,005
I'll put a cast on it.
She'll wear it for a couple weeks.

560
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,466
- A cast?
- It barely hurts, I swear.

561
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,843
That's it? Just the wrist?
Everything else is fine?

562
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:22,137
- She seems perfectly healthy.
- She 'seems healthy'?

563
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:25,349
- You checked everything?
- Almost all that could have been affected.

564
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,060
- Almost?
- I assure you, we were very thorough.

565
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,145
I'm sure, I would like some extra thorough.

566
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:33,315
Anything that could have,
in any scenario, affected this body...

567
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:34,399
I want it checked out.

568
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:36,527
I'll run more x-rays
if it makes you feel better.

569
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:37,569
It will. Thanks.

570
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,864
Then we'll put the cast on
so it'll be a while before she can leave.

571
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,324
- I can wait.
- Okay.

572
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,661
Rory, I'll be right back.
You sit still for a minute, okay?

573
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:52,167
- The car's not so good.
- Nobody cares about the car.

574
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:55,087
Jess made sure he called
the ambulance and I was okay...

575
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:59,091
- before he even talked to the police...
- Let's just hear about the details later.

576
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,093
I just want you to relax now.

577
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,637
- You're not mad?
- No, I'm not mad.

578
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,139
So they brought you in the ambulance?

579
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:08,809
Did they use the siren?
I hope Taylor was in bed.

580
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,894
It was after 9:00, so there's a good chance.

581
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:11,937
Nice.

582
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,023
Rory, I'm gonna have the nurse take
you down to X-Ray.

583
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:17,568
- Can I go with her?
- No, you have to wait outside.

584
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,529
It'll be about an hour.
If you want to grab some coffee...

585
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:24,074
Okay. Thanks. Smile pretty for the camera.

586
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,270
- Where is he?
- Who?

587
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:56,106
- Where's Jess, Luke?
- I don't know. I just got back.

588
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,859
What's going on?
I got here. They weren't here.

589
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:01,862
Talk to me.

590
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,490
Jess, answer me right now.

591
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:05,657
What's wrong? What happened?

592
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:07,409
- There was an accident.
- What accident?

593
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:11,246
Jess was driving Rory's car,
and he crashed it.

594
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,500
- What? When?
- He crashed it tonight.

595
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:17,252
- Damn it.
- What happened? Is anyone hurt?

596
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,006
I'm talking to you.

597
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,425
- Where would he go?
- I asked you if anyone was hurt.

598
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,052
Was anyone hurt? Let's see...

599
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:29,097
Rory's in the emergency room with a
fractured wrist. Yes, someone was hurt.

600
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:31,808
- Rory fractured her wrist?
- She has to wear a cast.

601
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,519
She's getting x-rays and tests.

602
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,605
- What about Jess? Is he hurt?
- No, Jess did the hurting.

603
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:39,566
That little punk nephew of yours
almost killed my kid tonight.

604
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,652
I'm sure it was an accident.
Accidents happen.

605
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,196
- Not with my kid in the car.
- Calm down.

606
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,365
- Why did you do this?
- Why did I do what?

607
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,033
- Why did you bring him here?
- What?

608
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,828
If you hadn't brought him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

609
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,830
- This is my fault?
- Yes, it is your fault.

610
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,832
You told him to come and let him stay.

611
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,376
Everybody hated him,
everybody knew he was trouble...

612
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,545
but you wouldn't listen or send him home.

613
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:02,381
And now my daughter is in the hospital.

614
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:09,304
You kept pushing them together.
You asked her to help him study.

615
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:12,349
You knew she'd never say no.
I told you it made me nervous.

616
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:15,185
I told you I didn't like it,
and I should have stopped it.

617
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:18,438
You thought Rory'd be good for Jess,
never mind what he'd be to her.

618
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,399
- That wasn't important.
- Of course it was.

619
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,360
Why didn't you put a stop to it
at the first sign of trouble?

620
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:26,738
- Why didn't you make him leave?
- He's my nephew. I had an obligation.

621
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:30,450
- I had an obligation to care for him.
- You had an obligation to this town...

622
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:34,121
- to me and to Rory. Where are you going?
- I have to find out where Jess is.

623
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:35,706
I'll tell you where he's not:

624
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,625
In the emergency room,
having his arm plastered up.

625
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:43,630
I am sorry about Rory. You know I care
more about her than I do myself.

626
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,717
At least you know where Rory is,
and that she's okay.

627
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,928
I have to find Jess,
and make sure that he's okay.

628
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:53,348
If that cuts into your screaming time,
that's too damn bad!

629
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:55,642
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you.

630
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,045
Chris?

631
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:48,028
- I made sure she was okay.
- I know you did.

632
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,294
Okay, you got your TV...

633
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:08,465
your books, magazines,
refreshments, CD player, assorted CDs...

634
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:11,051
Stan Freberg.
You have your Sinad O'Connor...

635
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,970
because when life really gets you down...

636
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,305
Sinad's the one
to teach you some perspective.

637
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:18,851
There's a pad and paper if you decide
to write the great American novel...

638
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:23,105
and over here,
you have a tiny-but-annoying bell...

639
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,023
in case there's something that you need...

640
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:28,527
and you want to summon
the common-but-lovely house-wench...

641
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,154
who will leave her talking mice...

642
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,531
and come to fetch the Contessa
whatever she needs.

643
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,950
I think what Contessa
requires right now is sleep.

644
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,410
Is your arm hurting you?

645
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,954
But the stuff they gave me
made me a little dopey.

646
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:42,916
My little Marianne Faithfull.
Scooch down now and go to sleep.

647
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:51,133
- What are you doing?
- Just a little feng shui. Go to sleep.

648
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,428
You don't have to sleep in here tonight.

649
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:57,389
- I think the chair looks nice here.
- What's the blanket for?

650
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,308
- In case the chair gets cold.
- The pillow?

651
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,352
To keep the blanket company.
Okay, everything's in its place.

652
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:06,023
Chair seems warm, blanket seems happy.
Just one thing missing.

653
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,067
Good night.

654
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:12,237
- Freak of sideshow proportions.
- I love you, too.

655
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,744
I'm sorry.

656
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,955
The chair is trying to sleep.

657
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:14,216
What are you doing here?

658
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,677
I have a really crappy mattress at home.

659
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:19,972
I drove here as fast as I could,
and I went to the hospital...

660
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:23,600
but you had left, so I tried your phone,
but all I got was the voicemail.

661
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:28,605
I came here but the place looked dark, so I
got the key out of the turtle and came in...

662
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:32,651
but you guys were already asleep,
so I just grabbed a chair and...

663
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,321
And apparently my evil plan
worked exactly as I anticipated.

664
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:38,824
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Me, too.

665
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:42,870
- How's she doing?
- She's in a cast.

666
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,997
- I know.
- The doctor said she'll be fine.

667
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,457
He'll take it off in a couple of weeks.

668
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,376
The car is totally gone.

669
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:53,630
I have to call the insurance guy tomorrow,
and I don't know...

670
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:55,591
- Did you find that kid?
- Jess?

671
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:57,759
'Jess. ' 'Dead meat. '
Whatever his name is.

672
00:36:57,843 --> 00:37:00,596
No. Little ferret's
hiding out somewhere, I'm sure.

673
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:05,058
I'm gonna deal with the car tomorrow,
and I'll talk to the doctor if that's okay.

674
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:06,476
I'll need a picture of Jess...

675
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,687
so I don't rip off
the head of the wrong kid...

676
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,189
'cause that would be bad.

677
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,192
- Look at you, all springing into action.
- About time, isn't it?

678
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,569
- I like the superhero you.
- Just trying to keep up.

679
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:19,656
Are you staying here tonight
or do you have to rush back?

680
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,161
- I want to spend time with Rory tomorrow.
- Sherrie's cool with you staying here?

681
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:25,871
Rory comes first.

682
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,667
- Do you want some coffee?
- I'll get it.

683
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,128
Do you know how to make coffee?

684
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:34,838
- Yes, I do.
- My coffee?

685
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,258
- One bag of coffee per cup of water, right?
- Perfect.

686
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:40,886
Oh, my God.

687
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:44,640
You know, when Rory called me tonight
and said the word 'hospitaI'...

688
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,768
I just legitimately thought
I was having a heart attack.

689
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:50,395
And let me tell you, it was not fun.
I'm joining a gym.

690
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:53,565
- That's how not-fun it was.
- Can you get a two-for-one membership?

691
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:55,067
Anything could've happened.

692
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,402
- It could have been so much worse.
- It wasn't.

693
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:59,947
- No, it wasn't, but it could have been.
- It wasn't.

694
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,658
Everything's gonna be okay.

695
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:05,327
About the fight we had
the last time you were here...

696
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,789
- That was a doozy, wasn't it?
- I just... I didn't mean to...

697
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,042
- I shouldn't have...
- No, but if I implied that...

698
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,710
You didn't. I just snapped.

699
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,712
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

700
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:16,964
Me, too.

701
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:25,264
Did I mention I'm really glad you're here?

702
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:28,225
I believe you did.

703
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,019
Good for me then.

704
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,740
- The Yearling?
- Great movie.

705
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,618
You'd think they'd have gotten
the genius in charge of this...

706
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,453
to come up with something
other than that.

707
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:52,249
Picking a movie that will appeal
to a large group of people is hard.

708
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:56,170
- We'll get seats.
- Oh, my God. Let me see.

709
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,005
That sucks.

710
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,341
- Does it hurt?
- Only when I remember how I got it.

711
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:03,343
Here. Angry Girl for an angry arm.

712
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:05,804
- Cool. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

713
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:07,931
So, tell me what happened.

714
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:12,561
It was horrible. I have never been involved
in anything so horrible in my life.

715
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:13,687
But what happened?

716
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,649
An animal ran out into the road
and we swerved and hit a pole.

717
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,860
- And my beautiful car...
- How bad?

718
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:22,779
- Have you talked to Dean?
- No, he gets home tomorrow.

719
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:24,573
- What are you gonna say?
- I don't know.

720
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:27,993
- He's gonna freak. And Jess?
- Not since last night.

721
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,830
Yeah, everyone is so upset right now.

722
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:35,000
My dad's in town and something
happened between Mom and Luke...

723
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,586
and she won't tell me what. I don't know.

724
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:41,715
They just need time to cool off
and then everything will be fine.

725
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:44,676
Everyone just needs time.
Maybe I'll try to call him tomorrow.

726
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,679
Tomorrow. That's plenty of time.
No one will still be mad then.

727
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:51,391
- Sarcasm does not become you.
- Maybe not, but it does sustain me.

728
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:55,020
- Why isn't Jackson here?
- He's singing to his persimmons tonight.

729
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,523
- They've been a little sour lately.
- Right.

730
00:39:57,564 --> 00:40:01,109
- Right? You just accept that explanation?
- Why shouldn't I?

731
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:04,863
She just told you the man
is not here because he's singing to fruit.

732
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,492
That's better than dancing with it.
Remember last year's watermelon crop?

733
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,661
Yeah. Threw his back out.

734
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,955
Okay, I'm facing the screen now.

735
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:15,457
The movie's starting?
I thought it started at 8:00.

736
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,876
This is a little pre-movie treat.

737
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:28,345
- I can't wait to meet your family.
- I'm very close to my family.

738
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:31,265
I know this. That's why
I can't wait to meet your family.

739
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:35,227
Remember, Daddy is quite protective.
I'm his favorite daughter.

740
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,854
He has good taste.

741
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:39,606
- I intend to tell him that.
- I love you.

742
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,196
- Daddy.
- You are with my favorite daughter.

743
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:48,490
- You have good taste.
- Come in the house.

744
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:49,950
I love you.

745
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:10,345
- I love your daughter.
- Who are you to love my daughter?

746
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:13,140
- What do you have to offer her?
- Nothing.

747
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:14,850
Only this.

748
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:31,575
- He raps later.
- Jackson needs to see this.

749
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,619
If I can get him here quick enough...

750
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,871
We are so playing this again
after the movie.

751
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:37,748
Great. I'll be back.

752
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,544
This town is like
one big outpatient mental institution.

753
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,922
- Glad you could join us.
- Yeah, me, too.

754
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:52,763
It's so nice you decided
to stay for the movie.

755
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:54,932
I mean, it's really fun being able to say:

756
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:57,434
'Look, I know that person.
I talk to him every day...

757
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:59,019
'and so far, he's never bitten me. '

758
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:04,900
I'm definitely coming around more often.
You need protection.

759
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:09,071
- Coming around more often sounds good.
- I wish I could stay longer.

760
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,323
You gotta get back to Sherrie.

761
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:15,244
- Don't worry. We understand.
- Yeah, I wish I could stay.

762
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,498
Where did Sookie go? Oh, my Lord!

763
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:23,293
Quick, cover her eyes. She's just a child.
She shouldn't have to see this.

764
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:26,046
- He's taking his shirt off.
- I shouldn't have to see this.

765
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:27,631
- I'm going for popcorn.
- Me, please.

766
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:30,008
- Me, too.
- Got it. Be right back.

767
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:35,514
- I like it when he's here.
- Yeah. Me, too.

768
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:38,350
Let's eat.

769
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,367
I did the choreography.

770
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:58,120
- Patty, doll, come here.
- I'll see you later.

771
00:42:58,203 --> 00:42:59,788
Bye, Patty.

772
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:03,458
How are you feeling?

773
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:05,669
Haunted by the sight of Kirk's bare chest.

774
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,754
- No!
- I swear to God!

775
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:09,214
- When?
- Last night...

776
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:11,175
not long after the accident happened...

777
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:14,344
Luke walked him
straight to the bus station...

778
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:16,096
stuck the kid on a bus,
sent him home to his mom's.

779
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,640
I can't believe Luke
would send him off like that.

780
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:20,350
I heard the kid wanted to go.

781
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:24,104
I don't know.
All I know is that Jess is gone.

782
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:29,735
What will we do
for entertainment around here?

783
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:31,778
Beats the hell out of me.

784
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:18,826
English
