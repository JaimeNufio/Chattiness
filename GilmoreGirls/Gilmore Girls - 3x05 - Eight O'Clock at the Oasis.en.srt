1
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:40,006
And the rabbit says, ‘How about that schnitzel!’

2
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:41,415
Well?

3
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:43,579
Well what? There’s no punchline.

4
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:44,804
That is the punchline.

5
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,955
‘How about that schnitzel!’ – that’s the punchline?

6
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,834
Well, no, not when you say it like that.

7
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:50,539
- How am I supposed to say it? 
- Like a punchline.

8
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:52,663
- How about that schnitzel! 
- Oh, forget it.

9
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:54,102
- What? 
- You ruined my joke.

10
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:55,992
No, the punchline ruined your joke.

11
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:59,140
- What? 
- You admit it’s a punchline.

12
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:01,875
- Oh my God. 
- Ha, I am vindicated.

13
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,158
‘How about that schnitzel!’ has officially been declared a punchline.

14
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,244
A really bad punchline.

15
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,056
No one asked for the Norton Critical Edition.

16
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:10,349
All the schnitzel and I wanted was some recognition and now we have it.

17
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:13,600
- Oh, man, it’s packed in here. 
- I guess we counter it.

18
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:14,522
Oh, I guess we do.

19
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:18,131
What?

20
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:20,793
What do you know, your face really can freeze that way.

21
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:22,898
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah, I’m fine, I’m great.

22
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:26,124
- It’s a big fat happy sunshine day for me. 
- Business looks good.

23
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:27,251
Yeah, the place is packed.

24
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:29,427
Sure, it’s been taken over by the J. Crew catalog.

25
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:30,912
Oh, look, babies!

26
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,637
I never wanna hear that come out of your mouth again.

27
00:01:32,714 --> 00:01:35,638
- Find the yellow ball. 
- Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball...

28
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,727
- Ah, yellow duck. 
- Ball.

29
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:40,508
Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball.

30
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:43,939
Every weekend, the same stupid group comes in here and take up all my tables

31
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:46,708
and every chair they can get their sticky hands on, and they do that.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,749
They sit, they stand, one person holds the kid, another person holds the kid.

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,560
I’ve got Choo-Choo Joe.

34
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:54,275
This guy runs in and out and back and forth,

35
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,360
the other guy never takes his head out of that stupid bag,

36
00:01:56,426 --> 00:02:00,698
the women can’t figure out which kid is which, and they do it all morning long,

37
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,236
and then order two iced teas to go, and that is it.

38
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:06,093
- I’m sure you’re exaggerating. 
- I am not exaggerating.

39
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:08,392
- Oh god. 
- Oh, now, this is good, you see...

40
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,405
Choo-Choo Joe will not be working.

41
00:02:10,492 --> 00:02:12,089
Get the Bongo Bear. Get the Bongo Bear.

42
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:13,574
How’d you know that?

43
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:16,181
Because Joe has not been working for the last six months.

44
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:20,032
Personally, I don’t think he’s broken, I think he killed himself to get away from that family.

45
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:23,273
- Oh, now that kid’s a major drooler. 
- Yeah, it’s like a fountain.

46
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:24,999
Okay, that’s it, they have to go.

47
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:27,416
Luke, come on, it’s just spit. Pretend you’re at a baseball game.

48
00:02:27,498 --> 00:02:28,982
No no no, I’ve had enough.

49
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:31,214
Let them go not spend money at Al’s, I’m through.

50
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:36,052
Is that woman doing what I think she’s doing?

51
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:40,355
Well, I can’t be a hundred percent sure, but... oh yeah, that’s lunch.

52
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:43,258
Why, why do they do this? This is a public place, people are eating here.

53
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:45,260
- They sure are. 
- This cannot be sanitary.

54
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:46,705
I agree. You don’t know where that thing’s been.

55
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:48,270
When did that become acceptable?

56
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:51,005
In the old days, a woman would never consider doing that in public.

57
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:53,714
They’d go find a barn or a cave or something.

58
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:55,957
I mean, it’s indecent. This is a diner not a peep show!

59
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:59,587
Hey, consider making it a combo. You could charge more for your cheeseburgers.

60
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,787
Of course, no one would ever feel the same ordering a glass of milk again, but...

61
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:06,765
I have to do something. I just can’t stand here and let the lactating continue.

62
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:08,101
- Luke. 
- Gross!

63
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,914
I’m gross? I’m not the one exposing myself

64
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:12,731
for the entire world to see. That’s it.

65
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:17,585
- You go make her stop. 
- I’m not going over there.

66
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:19,172
- Why not? You’re a woman. 
- So what?

67
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:21,020
- So you have the same parts. 
- What?

68
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:23,007
- You shouldn’t be scared of it. 
- Scared of it?

69
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,385
You know, you’re gonna be a bachelor for a really long time.

70
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:28,034
I am being taken advantage of here,

71
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:30,718
and I do not like being taken advantage of. I hate this!

72
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:34,270
Oh geez!

73
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,224
Okay, well, that was kind of fun.

74
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:38,720
Aw, is it your nap time?

75
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:42,634
The Tylers in twelve asked to have their toxic pillows removed.

76
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,236
Our pillows aren’t toxic.

77
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:47,344
According to the complimentary travel magazine that we put in their room,

78
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,279
down pillows can carry airborne diseases and mold.

79
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,736
Unbelievable – I didn’t think anyone ever read those magazines.

80
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:55,911
I think she had to, there was a picture of a roast chicken on the cover.

81
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:57,349
- Michel. 
- She is large.

82
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,054
- Michel. 
- And her husband in ugly.

83
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:01,134
They threw pillows at me!

84
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,369
Independence inn.

85
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:06,822
You really should identify yourself when you answer the phone at work.

86
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:10,686
Sorry. Independence Inn, major disappointment speaking. Better?

87
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:11,722
Yes, thank you.

88
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,277
- Now I wanna talk to you about something. 
- Shoot.

89
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:18,229
I’m in charge of the Society Matron’s League’s annual antique auction

90
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,951
next Tuesday and I thought maybe you’d like to come.

91
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:22,593
Society Matron’s League? That’s quite a name.

92
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,220
And what is wrong with that name, Lorelai?

93
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,039
Nothing, it just sounds so serious.

94
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:29,603
Brings to mind a room full of old ladies wearing black dresses and cameos

95
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:32,264
and pushing spoonfuls of cod liver oil on the kids.

96
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,999
That’s a very flattering portrait of my friends you’re painting.

97
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:38,189
I didn’t mean your friends. I meant the other old ladies in the league,

98
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,755
the ones who don’t like you and your friends ‘cause you guys are so young.

99
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:43,305
- Kindly wrap this up soon, Lorelai. 
- Consider it wrapped.

100
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:46,391
Thank you. As I was saying, all the proceeds from the auction go

101
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:49,997
to the children’s hospital, and we’re going to be offering some lovely pieces

102
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:52,264
which I think would like very nice in that inn of yours.

103
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:53,436
What sort of pieces?

104
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:57,139
Basically a lot canes and shawls, a couple of walkers.

105
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:00,960
I believe we finally talked Old Lady Rollins into giving up her teeth.

106
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:02,311
What sort of pieces, Mom?

107
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,180
We have a couple of wonderful writing desks, and some French end tables,

108
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,397
rocking chairs, picture frames, lamps, davenports.

109
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,176
Well…

110
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:12,438
The worst that can happen is you won’t find anything you like

111
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:15,772
and you’ve wasted a couple of hours. And who knows, you might find something you love.

112
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,018
Plus, I will be way too busy to sit with you if that is of concern.

113
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:21,916
That is not a concern. Define ‘way too busy.’

114
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:24,477
- Are you interested or not? 
- When is this auction?

115
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:26,663
- Tuesday at one o’clock. 
- I’ll think about it.

116
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:28,255
- I’ll see you Tuesday. 
- Bye.

117
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:32,894
I’m sorry, did I hear you mention something about an auction?

118
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,903
My mother’s women’s group is having one next week.

119
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:38,516
Oh, well, you know – I love a good auction. The drama, the strategy.

120
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,298
- The strategy? 
- Oh, yes.

121
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,277
First, you mustn’t be too eager because that drives the price way up.

122
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:45,557
Don’t be too eager, got it.

123
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:49,557
And you must always be extremely careful of your paddle movements.

124
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:52,808
- Well, that certainly calls for a "Dirty!" 
- How’s your arm raise?

125
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,092
- Good? 
- Pretty good.

126
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,321
Ah, I have an excellent arm raise.

127
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:58,112
That’s what it says on the bathroom wall.

128
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:01,912
- Yes, well, if you need some tips... 
- I’ll give you a call.

129
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:02,720
Good.

130
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:05,945
- Take me to the auction! 
- Michel.

131
00:07:06,022 --> 00:07:08,244
Take me, I insist you take me!

132
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:09,525
You don’t even know if it’s gonna be any good.

133
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:10,979
It’s just a bunch of society women.

134
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,844
If your mother’s involved, it will be impeccable

135
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:15,220
and I haven’t been to an impeccable auction in over a year.

136
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,253
- Well, I don’t know. 
- What do you want?

137
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:20,401
- Michel, I don’t want anything. 
- Stop playing coy with me.

138
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,285
I want into that auction, you name your price.

139
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:24,744
Okay, you have to work weekends for the rest of this month.

140
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:25,511
Done.

141
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:26,924
And you have to answer the phone when it rings.

142
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:27,738
Done.

143
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:31,270
And you have to answer it in English, unless the person is actually foreign.

144
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:32,028
Done.

145
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:34,235
And you have to oversee the nature hikers next week.

146
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,213
No.

147
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,687
Michel, if you wanna go to this auction,

148
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:40,473
you have to be in the lobby at six o’clock Friday morning.

149
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,890
You have to hand out towels and water bottles,

150
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:44,519
you have to show them the hiking trails,

151
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:46,447
and you have to let them give you a nature name.

152
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:49,429
Fine, I will let them give me a nature name.

153
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,794
- All right, then, you can come. 
- Thank you.

154
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:55,437
- Buttercup. 
- You cannot give them suggestions!

155
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,783
I can’t believe you got into a fight with Pete.

156
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:03,216
Hey, you do not suddenly decide that garlic is an extra topping,

157
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:05,644
not after five years, not after all we’ve been through.

158
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:08,665
We single-handedly helped Pete pay for that new delivery truck of his,

159
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,708
and I thought he needed to be reminded of that fact.

160
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:11,624
Very loudly.

161
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,313
- Not that loudly. 
- Dogs started barking.

162
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,005
Because they heard about the garlic incident,

163
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:17,123
and no one likes getting screwed, Rory, not even a Schnauzer.

164
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,494
Pete’s a swindler. He takes advantage of single mothers

165
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:22,126
and their innocent children and for that, he must pay – what?

166
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:23,796
He gave us free cheesy bread.

167
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:24,768
He did?

168
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:26,944
- Oh! 
- Yeah.

169
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:29,090
- I love the cheesy bread. 
- I know you do.

170
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:32,470
- It’s all hot, too. 
- Now doesn’t someone feel a little silly?

171
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:34,502
- Me? 
- Should we call Pete tonight?

172
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:36,975
- Okay, after cheesy bread. 
- Fine, after the cheesy bread.

173
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:38,688
I’m gonna go get the mail – go on inside.

174
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:40,657
Okay, I’m gonna go melt some more cheese on the pizza.

175
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,598
Melt away.

176
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:47,835
- Hey! Hello there, neighbor! 
- Hi. I’m sorry, are we neighbors?

177
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:50,370
Yes, yes we are. I just moved in across the way.

178
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:53,376
Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Beenie Morrison’s old place.

179
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:55,106
That’s right, Beenie Morrison’s old place.

180
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:56,646
Beenie Morrison’s old place.

181
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:59,418
I live in Beenie Morrison’s old place. Isn’t that great?

182
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,496
Only if Beenie Morrison didn’t want to live there anymore.

183
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,623
Oh no, I paid him a very good price. Overpaid, actually, but it was worth it.

184
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,080
I’ve been dreaming about a place like Beenie Morrison’s old place

185
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:13,482
for a long time, and then I found it. I’m sorry, I’m just really excited.

186
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:15,701
- That’s okay, it’s nice. 
- It’s a great neighborhood.

187
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,143
- Yes, it is. 
- Everyone’s so friendly. Babette.

188
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,031
- Do you know Babette? 
- Everybody knows Babette.

189
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:23,688
Oh, she’s a great lady. Oh, anyhow, I’m Dwight.

190
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:26,474
I’m Lorelai. And if you see a teen walking around with a halo

191
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,917
and a book, that’s my daughter Rory.

192
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,320
Very nice to meet you, Lorelai.

193
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:31,860
Nice to meet you too, Dwight. Welcome to the neighborhood.

194
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,331
If there’s anything I can do to help out, let me know.

195
00:09:35,562 --> 00:09:36,990
- Really? 
- Sure.

196
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,097
Well, that’s great. Actually, I have this little favor I’d love to ask.

197
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:44,664
- Oh, right now? 
- Well, this week.

198
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:49,581
You know, I just got this beautiful lawn put in, really amazing shade of green,

199
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,356
and the guy who put it in for me, he told me that I have to keep

200
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:57,148
each bade of grass very moist for the first few days while the roots take,

201
00:09:57,273 --> 00:10:00,171
but I have to go on a business trip for a few days.

202
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:03,959
Huh, last minute, and believe me, I tried to get out of it but my boss said,

203
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:08,296
‘Dwight, get off your keister and go make us some money’, so I gotta go.

204
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:10,350
Well, sure, when the word keister’s being thrown around,

205
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,205
what are you gonna do?

206
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:15,495
Exactly. So I was wondering if maybe you could water my lawn?

207
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:19,060
Only for a few days. You know, a little in the morning,

208
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:22,388
a little in the late afternoon or evening, depending on your schedule.

209
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,016
It would be a really big favor.

210
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:29,136
Well, I guess, I could water your lawn, Dwight – sure.

211
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,426
Boy, that is something.

212
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:34,820
If I would have asked somebody back where I used to live to water my lawn,

213
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:39,151
I would’ve gotten a much more HBO kind of answer. I love it here!

214
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,676
- So, can you come on over now? 
- Excuse me?

215
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,860
So I can show you where the on/off nozzle is. It’ll only take a second.

216
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,175
Oh, my daughter’s waiting inside for me, I...

217
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:49,694
Oh, well, we can do it tomorrow before I leave.

218
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,220
Great. What time are you leaving tomorrow?

219
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:53,068
- Six a.m. 
- Now sounds fine.

220
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:55,578
- That’s so terrific. Follow me. 
- Okay.

221
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,355
You just gotta go over here and make a right.

222
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,634
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know where it is.

223
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:06,771
Welcome to The Oasis! That’s what I named this place, The Oasis,

224
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:09,877
my oasis, a little slice of heaven right here on Earth.

225
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:13,601
Gosh, I swear, I still can’t believe I’m here.

226
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,924
- I was in a terrible marriage, you know. 
- Actually, I didn’t.

227
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:19,639
Oh, yeah, horrible, like a punishment out of Greek mythology.

228
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:23,560
The women had five heads, suffering, agony. You know, I used to be taller?

229
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:25,650
- Really, she shrunk you? 
- I used to have more hair, too.

230
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,027
And higher arches.

231
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:30,734
But through all the screaming and the name calling,

232
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:34,584
the berating and the humiliation, somewhere in the back of my mind,

233
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:37,682
I knew someday I would have it – my oasis.

234
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:39,659
Oh, that’s what got me through.

235
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,189
That’s what kept me from sticking my head

236
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:43,657
through a plate glass window every night when I got home.

237
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,716
Well, that’s a really nice story, Dwight. It’s very inspiring and...

238
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:51,978
oh, hey, this looks like it does something.

239
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,810
Huh? Oh, yeah, this is the on/off spigot.

240
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,932
You just turn it to the right for on.

241
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:02,819
And the left for off.

242
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:05,239
- Seems simple. 
- It’s very simple.

243
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,923
- Okay, so, twice a day. 
- Yeah, for a good fifteen minute soaking.

244
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,018
- I will soak my best. 
- I really appreciate it.

245
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,685
- Okay, well, you have a good trip. 
- I owe ya.

246
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,444
- Where have you been? 
- Get in the house.

247
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:21,057
- I thought you were gonna go get the mail. 
- Go, go, go!

248
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:21,753
What are you doing?

249
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,776
Don’t look around, stare straight ahead, no more talking to people ever!

250
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:24,600
Mom!

251
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:31,031
Next up, we have an occasional table from

252
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,734
a distinguished, family-owned company in Vermont, circa 1912.

253
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,656
We shall start the bidding at two hundred-fifty dollars.

254
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:40,326
Do I hear two-fifty? Two hundred fifty...

255
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:42,112
Wow, lots of garbage at these things.

256
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:43,765
Always. You’ve got to be patient

257
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,310
and wait for what you want to appear, then pounce.

258
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,992
True at an auction, true at a singles bar.

259
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,730
To put it crudely, yes.

260
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:54,093
Crap, crap, crap that makes the previous two items not seem like crap.

261
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,316
Could you keep your crap commentaries to yourself?

262
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:59,613
Four hundred dollars, we have four hundred, four hundred –

263
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,546
going once, going twice, sold to bidder number sixty-five.

264
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,031
Aw, wow, that was a good table.

265
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,672
It was a good table, not a great table.

266
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,851
We should’ve gone for it.

267
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:09,505
Too expensive and too many scratches.

268
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:10,837
We could’ve buffed the scratches out.

269
00:13:10,912 --> 00:13:12,798
Look, if you want it that bad, it’s quite obvious

270
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,264
that the buyer’s children will be selling it at his probate in the very near future.

271
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,290
- You’re awful. 
- And he’s old, now be quiet.

272
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,371
- Lorelai? 
- Hey Mom, you remember Michel?

273
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:24,917
- Yes, from the inn. 
- Hello Mrs. Gilmore.

274
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:27,524
- Didn’t you see me waving at you before? 
- Yeah.

275
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:28,614
You didn’t wave back.

276
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,667
It’s dangerous to wave at an auction. You didn’t see before,

277
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,971
but when you waved you bought a motorcycle and a sidecar.

278
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,916
- I did not. 
- Circa 1912.

279
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:38,154
Now would you drive it or would you sit in the sidecar?

280
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:40,350
There she is, the Cobra.

281
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:42,111
- Oh, now, Natalie. 
- The what?

282
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:44,951
This woman gets her way or she squeezes ‘til you comply.

283
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,007
Like a superhero.

284
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:48,471
Ignore her, Natalie is just being Natalie.

285
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,484
- My daughter, Lorelai. 
- Nice to meet you.

286
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:53,094
Your mother’s got such spunk. You must love her.

287
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:55,122
I think she’d squeeze me to death if I didn’t.

288
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:56,818
Natalie, you’re embarrassing me.

289
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,158
Oh, hush, Emily. Listen to this...

290
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:03,048
our auctioneer calls in sick this morning, they are such flakes,

291
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:05,209
and what is an auction without an auctioneer?

292
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:08,312
Just a bunch of nuts with paddles surrounded by mismatched furniture?

293
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:09,643
Exactly.

294
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:12,536
But your mother got on the horn with that lazy Charlie

295
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,528
and she squeezed and squeezed ‘til – voila –

296
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,082
he suddenly felt better. The Cobra.

297
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:20,032
- The Cobra. 
- Oh, now, stop it.

298
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,445
You’re humble, don’t be.

299
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,616
- Nice to meet you. 
- Same here.

300
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:26,786
Edna’s group wants to give you kudos, too, Emily.

301
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:28,697
- Make sure to swing by. 
- I will.

302
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,578
I should make the rounds. Say goodbye before you leave.

303
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,123
- I will, Cobra. 
- Stop it.

304
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,608
It goes with the motorcycle thing, too.

305
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:38,317
Do I have two hundred-fifty? Two hundred-fifty, thank you.

306
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:40,102
Do I have three hundred? Three hundred...

307
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:41,271
Oh, is this our end tables?

308
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,000
Moving on to three-fifty? Three-fifty, do we have four?

309
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,126
- Let me do the paddle. 
- No.

310
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,215
I just wanna hold it, it’s still your thing.

311
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:50,110
I’m losing my concentration.

312
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:53,053
- Fine. I’m gonna go get a drink. 
- Please.

313
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,313
Do we have five hundred?

314
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:58,903
- Can I get a Merlot, please? 
- Yes sir.

315
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:01,278
Oh, that sounds great, make it two.

316
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:04,338
Got just enough for one and this is the last of the red, sorry.

317
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:09,992
- Aw. I’ll give you two bucks for it. 
- They’re free.

318
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,998
Which makes two bucks a great offer, and this is an auction, right?

319
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,170
- Yes. 
- Three.

320
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,701
- What? 
- I’ll give you three for it.

321
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:17,129
- Four. 
- Five.

322
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:18,296
- Six. 
- Six-fifty

323
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:20,903
- Ooh, losing steam. 
- Just weighing cost versus benefit.

324
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:22,291
Well, you’ve gotta think about these things.

325
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:24,718
How about this? Can I get an empty glass?

326
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,732
Yes, sir.

327
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:30,350
Aw. You’re the Solomon of wine.

328
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:31,804
Everybody’s gotta be something.

329
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,732
I got a few things coming up that I’m bidding on.

330
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:42,116
Oh, oh. Great, the bartender and I are the only ones in the building

331
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:43,673
that don’t get to hold a paddle.

332
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:45,915
Why don’t you put a bid on one of the paddles?

333
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:48,732
- What would I use to bid on it? 
- I’m Solomon, not Einstein.

334
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:50,273
Bye Solomon.

335
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:54,656
Oops, I had a spare bottle all the time.

336
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:57,682
Oh, thanks. This was better.

337
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,213
Hi, yes, I was at your auction yesterday and I was wondering

338
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:10,176
if you could help me. I met a man there and I would like to contact him

339
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:12,960
but I didn’t get his name and I wondered if you could look it up for me.

340
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:15,495
He was paddle number seventeen, and...

341
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,879
Oh right, confidential, got it...

342
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,620
Well, you know, actually, I misspoke earlier because

343
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:24,379
this isn’t a complete stranger I’m trying to contact here,

344
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:25,911
he’s an old friend from school...

345
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:28,733
Good question. Well, I don’t know his name because

346
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,171
I only knew him by his nickname...

347
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:34,179
Shamu. We called him Shamu.

348
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:38,639
He was kind of a big guy in high school, but he’s slimmed down quite a bit...

349
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,249
No, see, I don’t have time to contact the high school alumni committee

350
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:44,876
because time is of the essence...

351
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:47,939
See, Shamu and I went to a liquor store after the auction

352
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:51,287
and we bought a lottery ticket together and we tore it

353
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:55,179
and I took half and he took half, and I’ll be damned if the thing didn’t win!

354
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,677
Fourteen million dollars!

355
00:16:58,173 --> 00:17:02,633
Really, but see, we have to claim it by four p.m. today or we forfeit...

356
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,933
Ah, yes...

357
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:09,624
Oh, well, but there’s one more thing that I forgot to tell you. See...

358
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:13,290
my blood type is o-negative and he’s o-negative

359
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:15,870
and I have a medical condition that...

360
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:21,292
All right, then. Well, thank you anyway. Bye.

361
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,570
- So... 
- Yes?

362
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,795
You ran into your old friend Shamu?

363
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,932
- And you won millions of dollars? 
- Yup.

364
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,407
And you need a transfusion?

365
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,469
I’m just trying to get the name of a really cool guy I met

366
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:34,057
at this auction, but they won’t give it to me.

367
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:36,258
Wow, that’s a lot of effort. Must’ve been cute.

368
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:37,949
And witty – you don’t meet that everyday.

369
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:39,107
You know who would have his name?

370
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,155
- Who? 
- Grandma.

371
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:42,474
Ah, no, she only knows the Bitty’s, she doesn’t know the young ones.

372
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,949
She knows everyone at these kinds of things. You know Grandma.

373
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,453
- I cannot ask her for this. 
- Then kiss Shamu goodbye.

374
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:49,724
- But maybe you could ask her. 
- What?

375
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:51,569
Come on, ask her, do me a favor!

376
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:52,931
You want me to ask Grandma

377
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:56,177
for the name of a man that I didn’t meet at a function that I didn’t attend?

378
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:57,928
I’ll share my lottery winnings with you.

379
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,331
It’s ridiculously transparent.

380
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,579
- Fourteen million dollars. 
- But you’re sharing half with him

381
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,483
and taxes will take a huge chunk, and oh yeah,

382
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:05,164
you didn’t win the lottery. Ask her yourself.

383
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,371
You’re mean.

384
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,337
Did you call information and ask them for paddle seventeen’s listing?

385
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,239
What do you think of the pork? Rory?

386
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,719
It’s good.

387
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:16,208
- I’m not sure. Richard? 
- It’s fine.

388
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,636
I’m not sure.

389
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:18,942
It’s really good, Mom.

390
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:20,452
Yes, well, I’m not sure.

391
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,270
Pork is bred leaner these days.

392
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:26,054
It has a different taste. Less fat equals less flavor.

393
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:30,432
Yet another example of the great advances man has made, flavorless pork.

394
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:34,252
- Hurrah for the opposable thumbs. 
- All right, enough talk about pork.

395
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,737
Please, someone change the subject.

396
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,015
Mom had a really good time at the auction the other day.

397
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,467
- Did you? 
- Yes, yes, I did.

398
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,502
Well, I’m glad. Did you see anything you liked?

399
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,855
Yeah, Mom, anything look good to you there?

400
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:48,118
Yes, actually, I bought a couple of end tables for the inn.

401
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,571
I must say I was very impressed with the selection this year.

402
00:18:50,657 --> 00:18:53,335
I even wound up purchasing a couple of pieces for myself.

403
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:56,505
Yes, how nice to have yet another chair you can’t sit in.

404
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:58,803
- It’s one hundred years old. 
- Wonderful.

405
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,885
We can put it next to the two-hundred-year-old footstool you can’t put your foot on.

406
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:04,288
- Oh, Richard, please. 
- I’m only teasing, Emily.

407
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,828
It is one of the great pleasures of my life to be able to surround you

408
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,923
with a house full of useless objects. No, I’m never happier

409
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:13,928
than when we’re standing in the corner staring at our furniture.

410
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:15,074
Eat your pork, please.

411
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:17,196
You know, I believe there was something at the auction

412
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:20,079
that Mom wanted but she didn’t get. Isn’t that right, Mom?

413
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,492
Oh really? What was that?

414
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:23,949
I think it was a steamer trunk for Rory to take with her

415
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,480
to military school, wasn’t it, honey?

416
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:28,424
I don’t remember a steamer trunk, but I can check on it for you if you like.

417
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:29,823
That’s not necessary, Mom.

418
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:36,925
So, Mom, it was a very nice bunch of people you had at that auction.

419
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:38,353
Yes, very nice.

420
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:41,813
I was surprised at how many young people were there.

421
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:44,491
I mean, you know, younger people.

422
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,325
In fact, like, for instance, this guy that I talked to for quite awhile, he was...

423
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:51,703
- younger. 
- What man was that?

424
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,319
Oh, I didn’t get his name, but he was a nice looking guy.

425
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:58,363
He had a gray suit and he was paddle number seventeen. He likes Merlot.

426
00:19:58,456 --> 00:19:59,893
Are you talking about Peyton Sanders?

427
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:01,041
Oh, I don’t know, maybe.

428
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:02,950
Wait one second, I’ll look it up.

429
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:05,649
Oh, no no no, Mom, you don’t have to... she’s looking it up.

430
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,314
Paddle number seventeen, Peyton Sanders.

431
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:13,238
Oh great, oh, Peyton Sanders. Well, that’s great that it’s Peyton Sanders...

432
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,055
‘cause that’s... great.

433
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,588
How well do you know this Peyton Sanders?

434
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:19,751
- Why? 
- What?

435
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,972
Why do you wanna know how well I know Peyton Sanders?

436
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:25,367
I don’t wanna know. I was just mentioning that he was, you know, seemed...

437
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:26,536
- you know... 
- Young.

438
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:27,640
Yes, young.

439
00:20:28,814 --> 00:20:31,538
Okay, Mom... Peyton and I kind of hit it off

440
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:35,701
and I wondered if you possibly had his number...

441
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:38,103
okay, there, I said it. Pass the flavorless pork.

442
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:41,876
- You’re asking me for his number? 
- If it’s not a big deal, then yes.

443
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:46,162
Well, well, well. Richard, Lorelai’s asking me for a man’s number.

444
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,727
- So I heard. 
- But if it’s a big deal, forget it.

445
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:51,229
It’s not a big deal at all. I don’t have his number.

446
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,478
- Okay, then, never mind. 
- I can get his number.

447
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:55,803
- Would you like me to get his number? 
- It’s up to you.

448
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,923
It can’t be up to me. I didn’t ask for his number,

449
00:20:58,025 --> 00:21:00,539
you asked for his number, therefore it has to be up to you

450
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:02,029
as to whether or not I get his number.

451
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:03,842
- Okay, Mom. 
- Would you like me to get his number?

452
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:06,345
- Yes, if you don’t mind. 
- I don’t mind at all.

453
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,902
- Thank you. 
- You’re welcome.

454
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:11,661
I wasn’t kidding about that military school.

455
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:15,726
Okay, the clock is right! If we hurry, we still have time

456
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:17,990
- to hit Luke’s for breakfast. What’d I forget?
- Pants.

457
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,539
- Ooh, don’t do that. Come on, let’s go! 
- I can’t.

458
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:21,937
You can’t have breakfast? You have to have breakfast.

459
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:23,346
The clock is wrong, I’ll miss my bus.

460
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,677
Forget your bus, I’ll drive you to school.

461
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,115
- You will? 
- Yes. Oh shoot!

462
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:27,364
- What? 
- Dwight’s lawn.

463
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:28,818
Aw, there goes the breakfast sandwich.

464
00:21:28,911 --> 00:21:30,605
No, no, let’s hurry, we can still do Luke’s.

465
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:31,532
- Mom! 
- Let’s go!

466
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:33,749
- My shoes! 
- You don’t need shoes!

467
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,320
In my day, we walked twenty miles in the snow just to get to our shoes!

468
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:37,380
Aw, come on.

469
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:42,372
Okay, come on, sprinkle.

470
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,902
There, drink up boys, we’ve got a breakfast to get to.

471
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,661
Mom.

472
00:21:48,845 --> 00:21:49,874
- What? 
- I think this is for you.

473
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:53,022
Lorelai? No, it must be someone else. Hey, don’t read that.

474
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:55,962
Do not read that. I’m telling you, no good can come from you reading that.

475
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:57,266
- ‘Dear Lorelai...’ 
- And she’s reading it.

476
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,504
‘Just a couple of things that came to mind after we talked.’

477
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:00,375
Oh great.

478
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,766
‘First of all, thank you for this very kind favor you’re doing me.

479
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:06,223
 I still can’t believe that any one person would be so kind to someone they just met.’

480
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:09,803
Yeah, apparently Dwight’s last home was Oz, and not as in ‘The Wizard Of.’

481
00:22:09,898 --> 00:22:12,665
‘Second, since you are already coming over to take care of my lawn,

482
00:22:12,756 --> 00:22:17,155
I was hoping you wouldn’t mind stopping inside and watering my African violets.

483
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:19,924
I have written the directions on a separate piece of paper,

484
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:22,099
there’s a key in the planter by the door.

485
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:26,320
Please go in, make yourself at home. I have food in the fridge, satellite TV,

486
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:29,658
and a great collection of board games. My oasis is your oasis.’

487
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,366
I’m not going in that house. Rory, do not pick up that key.

488
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,830
But we have to water the violets.

489
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:37,068
No, I didn’t agree to violets. He threw the violets in

490
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:39,249
after he’d already rooked me into watering his lawn.

491
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,128
Don’t you at least wanna see what his house looks like?

492
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,367
Absolutely not.

493
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:44,641
Key, please.

494
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:47,374
Let me just say, if we walk in there

495
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,647
and his dead mother is sitting in a rocking chair, not a bit surprised.

496
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:56,888
- Oh, yeah, Dwight. 
- This place is great.

497
00:22:56,971 --> 00:22:59,254
Someone took the whole lounge craze very seriously.

498
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:01,957
- Oh my. 
- Oh geez, he wasn’t kidding.

499
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:04,283
I have never seen this many board games.

500
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,725
He’s got Monopoly from every country in the world.

501
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:07,861
- Hey, when you finally meet him? 
- Yeah?

502
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:10,785
Remember he owns Twister – there’s a great visual awaiting you.

503
00:23:10,893 --> 00:23:14,293
Got it. Hey, how come we don’t have a tiki bar?

504
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,919
Well, we are not two wild and crazy guys.

505
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,314
- You like pina coladas. 
- And getting lost in the rain.

506
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:20,365
I love it here.

507
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:21,814
It’s quite a statement, I’ll give him that.

508
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,510
- Hey, African violets. 
- Oh yeah, right.

509
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:24,938
Just a sec.

510
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,080
Hello? ... Hi Peyton, thanks for calling me back...

511
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:32,019
Well, I hope it was a good surprise.

512
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:33,990
It was a good surprise.

513
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:36,545
You just flew back on your jet, huh?

514
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:39,484
>From Maui? Sounds great...

515
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,573
Yes, I would love to get together with you...

516
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,322
Um, I’m pretty flexible next week. What’d you have in mind?

517
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:47,554
- David Bowie? 
- What?

518
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,264
I love David Bowie, I would love to go...

519
00:23:49,992 --> 00:23:53,227
Oh, well, yeah, it is a ways away, but...

520
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,725
No, I think that sounds just crazy enough.

521
00:23:57,544 --> 00:23:58,772
What sounds crazy enough?

522
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,461
That sounds great, Peyton. It’s a plan...

523
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:04,194
I’ll see you then, okay, bye.

524
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:05,956
We’re having dinner tomorrow.

525
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,190
What were you saying about David Bowie?

526
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,376
Well, first, he asked me to the David Bowie concert next week.

527
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:10,723
- You’re so lucky! 
- I know!

528
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:13,483
And once that was set, he said that a week was an awfully long time to wait.

529
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,507
- He did not. 
- So we’re having dinner tomorrow.

530
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:17,528
- And Bowie next week. 
- And Bowie next week.

531
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:20,651
Two dates in one phone call. Talk about not wasting any time.

532
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:23,018
He sounds very cool, and not just ‘cause he owns his own jet.

533
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,424
Well, remember to tell him that the way to get to you

534
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:27,759
is through your daughter, who desperately wants to go to Amsterdam.

535
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:28,997
I will remember.

536
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:32,116
- I think this place is lucky. 
- I think you may be right.

537
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:40,534
Of course, creepy’s the other word that comes to mind.

538
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:46,332
- The red skirt is not working. 
- Try the blue.

539
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,948
Blue let me down ten minutes ago, I think it’s conspiring with the red.

540
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,976
I wish you’d just wear the dress we picked out this morning.

541
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:52,316
No, you know as well as I do,

542
00:24:52,383 --> 00:24:54,677
the morning butt and evening butt are two completely different butts.

543
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,007
Well, whatever butt you’ve got tonight had better hurry

544
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,568
because he’s gonna be here any minute.

545
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:01,963
Rats. Fine, okay, striped skirt, burgundy sweater, that’s it.

546
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,097
What do you think? And remember, I’m wearing this no matter what

547
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:07,340
because I cannot spend one more second deciding what to wear,

548
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,326
so the answer has to be, ‘You look fantastic.’

549
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,560
You look fantastic.

550
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:12,603
- Pink and black. 
- With a flippy skirt.

551
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:13,570
Grab a necklace?

552
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,199
- Okay, here is my concern. 
- Voice it.

553
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:21,721
Well, you know, I only saw this guy once for like ten minutes

554
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:25,199
and the lighting was only so-so and I hadn’t eaten anything,

555
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,077
and, like, what if I’m remembering him a lot cuter than he was?

556
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,412
- I’m sure you’re not. 
- Yeah, but what if I am?

557
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,930
You know how these things are. You get bored, you need a diversion,

558
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:39,024
so you superimpose a really cute guy’s face over a really scary looking guy.

559
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,349
Well, then you’ll just have to strike up a conversation with him

560
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,175
and find out what kind of a man he is beneath the surface.

561
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,253
What? On the first date – what will he think of me?

562
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:48,620
Just order an extra dessert.

563
00:25:49,102 --> 00:25:51,738
- Okay, fine. Well? 
- I like the brown.

564
00:25:51,856 --> 00:25:53,899
Come here a sec, you’ve got some dirt on your forehead.

565
00:25:54,037 --> 00:25:55,932
I’m sorry, it’s just the sign of the devil, my mistake.

566
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,539
- You look beautiful. 
- Thank you.

567
00:25:58,512 --> 00:25:59,348
I think that’s him.

568
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,160
- Well, the car sure is pretty. 
- Come on.

569
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:09,695
Okay now, if for some reason, he does turn out to have like a horn

570
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:13,040
in the middle of his forehead, you will call me in one hour with a very high fever.

571
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:13,918
Deal.

572
00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:16,003
- God, I’m nervous. Why am I nervous? 
- Because you’re crazy.

573
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:17,130
Yes, good, thank you.

574
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,736
You’re feeling just fine.

575
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:23,586
- Hey Peyton. 
- Am I early?

576
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:25,992
No, you’re right on time. Peyton, I want you to meet my daughter, Rory.

577
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:27,601
- It’s a pleasure, Rory. 
- Hi.

578
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:31,011
Okay, so, don’t wait up and remember only two or three crackheads

579
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,312
at the most, they eat all the good cereal.

580
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:33,474
Deal. Have fun.

581
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:35,445
It was nice meeting you, Rory. You look wonderful.

582
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:37,626
Oh, so do you Peyton. So do you.

583
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:50,433
You up?

584
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:55,149
- What time is it? 
- 10:15.

585
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,746
- Oops. 
- Yup.

586
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:58,804
What happened? He was hornless.

587
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:01,159
No, he had no horns, he also had no personality.

588
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:02,655
- Yikes. 
- And no sense of humor.

589
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:04,785
- Gross. 
- And no idea how boring he was.

590
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:06,234
- I’m sorry. 
- That’s okay.

591
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:09,080
The evening started well enough – that is, until we got to the car...

592
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:13,617
a Jaguar XJ8 convertible with a 290 horsepower engine, in case you were wondering.

593
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:15,763
You weren’t? Funny, neither was I.

594
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:19,562
However, he told me anyhow. He told me a lot of other things about the car, also.

595
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:22,745
Like, did you know how many inches the pistons are? I do!

596
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:25,901
I also know the correct oil to use for it, how to treat the leather interior,

597
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:28,998
and how to load it onto a flatbed truck in case of a flat tire.

598
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,261
Geez, did he talk about anything else but the car?

599
00:27:31,364 --> 00:27:33,038
Not until we got to the restaurant...

600
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:36,710
- and the wine list. 
- Oh no, he’s a wine-y?

601
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:40,637
Yes, he sniffed, swirled, swished, and did every other pretentious

602
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:43,745
and borderline-disgusting thing that you can do with a glass of wine in a public place,

603
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:48,116
and he did it all while describing to me the vintage discrepancies and the wood they use

604
00:27:48,204 --> 00:27:52,655
for the barrels in Palermo and the grape crop projections for the following year.

605
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:57,207
And I, in turn, chimed in with my story about getting sick on Andre Cold Duck

606
00:27:57,282 --> 00:28:00,637
in the back of Peter Cutler’s car in ninth grade. He didn’t find that quite as charming.

607
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:03,699
I can’t believe that. That is one of your best anecdotes.

608
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:07,282
I know! So I stopped talking. He continued talking and I just sat there

609
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:11,512
thinking about Peter Cutler. How was Peter Cutler? Where was Peter Cutler?

610
00:28:11,614 --> 00:28:13,603
Was there any chance that Peter Cutler would appear

611
00:28:13,698 --> 00:28:16,223
and kill the man sitting across from me talking about torque?

612
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:17,447
Was the food good at least?

613
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,043
- Tiny portions, weird sauces. 
- I’m sorry.

614
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,266
That’s okay. You don’t know until you try, right?

615
00:28:22,476 --> 00:28:27,647
Anyhow, I am going to go to bed now and dream of Peter Cutler. Hopefully, it will be dirty.

616
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,701
What about Bowie?

617
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,267
I’m not sharing Peter Cutler with Bowie.

618
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:32,930
- Are you still going? 
- No.

619
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,604
There’s no way I could stand this guy for another night.

620
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:38,856
I’ll catch Bowie the next time he does a farewell tour.

621
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:40,202
- Bummer. 
- I know.

622
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,097
- Night Mom. 
- Night babe.

623
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:45,143
Oh, and hey, tomorrow, I’ll fill you in on how many hours you have

624
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,797
to clock to get your pilot’s license.

625
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:48,251
I cannot wait.

626
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,895
Well, the quilting convention is sitting down to tea.

627
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:55,741
- I’m doing internal cartwheels. 
- Any messages?

628
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:57,862
Your mother called. The auction people dropped the lamp

629
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,141
that we bought at her place and dropped hers off here

630
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:03,248
and she’s desperate to have it for some soiree at her house this evening.

631
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:06,084
Oh, swell. Well, I guess I can take it to her when I do my other errands.

632
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:07,354
I can pick up Rory, too.

633
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,653
- This is cool. 
- Yes, it was a personal purchase.

634
00:29:10,872 --> 00:29:13,597
- I want it, what is it? 
- An eighteenth century bleeding bowl.

635
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:15,706
A bleeding bowl?

636
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,720
When doctors bled patients, the blood had to go somewhere, no?

637
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,608
Okay – return lamp, pick up Rory, boil right hand.

638
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:33,181
- Hey Mom, I think this is yours. 
- Ah! Yes, it is.

639
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:35,710
- And I believe this is yours. 
- Yes, it is.

640
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:39,961
That auction house is usually so good with deliveries. I’m surprised at the mix up.

641
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:42,450
Oh, well, Gilmore and Gilmore – there’s kind of a connection there.

642
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:44,181
Yes, I suppose there is.

643
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:47,155
Okay, well, I have to pick up Rory in a little while, so we’ll see you Friday.

644
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:48,973
Would you like to sit down, maybe have some coffee?

645
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,725
Oh, I don’t wanna leave her standing there.

646
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:53,843
Well, Rory doesn’t get out for another half an hour. You’ve got a little time.

647
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:57,156
- Okay, I guess I can stay a minute. 
- Wonderful.

648
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:00,246
I’ll get you a stopwatch so you can keep exact time.

649
00:30:00,351 --> 00:30:01,711
That won’t be necessary, Mom.

650
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,441
- So, how is everything? 
- Everything’s fine.

651
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,099
- And how’s everything with Rory? 
- Everything with Rory’s fine.

652
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,797
- And how’s everything at the inn? 
- Everything at the inn is fine.

653
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:11,025
And how was your date?

654
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:14,319
- My what? 
- Your date with Peyton.

655
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:17,206
Well, my date was, shockingly enough, fine.

656
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:19,270
- How did you know about his date? 
- His mother told me.

657
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:20,794
- You know his mother? 
- A little.

658
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:22,993
- Oh good. 
- So, tell me, what did you do?

659
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,122
- When? 
- On your date.

660
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:28,451
Oh, well, we just went to dinner, that’s all.

661
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:30,243
I heard you went driving around afterward.

662
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:34,482
Well, sure, you know, we drove in the direction of my house.

663
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:37,663
- I guess you could call that driving around. 
- I heard Peyton had a lovely time.

664
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:40,996
Did he? Well, that’s nice, I’m glad. I should really get going, Mom.

665
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:43,868
Oh, you have a little more time. I wanna hear more about your date.

666
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,880
Well, it was just a date, you know, nothing special.

667
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:49,050
Two people eating and talking – one person talking slightly more than the other.

668
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:50,720
- Had he called you since? 
- No, but...

669
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:54,717
Oh, well, it was only last night, there’s time. I just think this is so exciting.

670
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:56,975
You know what, Mom, I wouldn’t get too excited if I were you.

671
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:57,719
Why not?

672
00:30:57,827 --> 00:30:59,853
Well, because we didn’t really hit it off that well.

673
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,869
- What? 
- No one’s fault, he’s just not really my type.

674
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:04,011
What do you mean he’s not your type?

675
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:06,367
Well, we just don’t have any of the same interests, and we didn’t find

676
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:09,003
a whole lot to talk about. You know, basically the date was kind of a dud.

677
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:11,154
Oh, well, that’s too bad.

678
00:31:11,297 --> 00:31:12,153
Yeah.

679
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:15,045
Well, you’ll just have to try a little harder on the next date.

680
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:15,946
Excuse me?

681
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:17,672
Aren’t you going to a concert together next week?

682
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:20,013
Ah, that Peyton’s a real Mama’s boy, isn’t he?

683
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,515
Just because he shares his life with his mother doesn’t make him a Mama’s boy, Lorelai.

684
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:25,144
I’m not gonna go to the concert with him, Mom.

685
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:26,218
But I thought you had a plan.

686
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,000
We did, but that was before we spent any time together

687
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:29,791
and realized we can’t spend any time together.

688
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,540
- You’re not gonna cancel on him. 
- Mom, believe me, he won’t be surprised.

689
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:36,766
- He didn’t have that great a time either. 
- Lorelai, you have to go to the concert.

690
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:39,101
You made a commitment to someone, you have to honor it.

691
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,874
- Mom, this is my business, okay? 
- This is so like you.

692
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:44,165
What is so like me?

693
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:47,089
You spend five seconds with a person and if they say one wrong thing,

694
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:49,271
you turn on them and never give them a second chance.

695
00:31:49,393 --> 00:31:52,004
- What? 
- You are extremely judgmental, Lorelai.

696
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:55,005
I’m not extremely judgmental of the pot calling the kettle black.

697
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:56,439
I spent two and a half hours with a man who talked

698
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:58,563
about nothing but himself, his place, his car...

699
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:00,909
He’s proud of his accomplishments. What’s wrong with that?

700
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,738
He didn’t end world hunger, Mom.

701
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,691
He simply made the grueling decision to spring for the bigger tires.

702
00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:07,842
- Lorelai. 
- Mom, you know what, I have to go.

703
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,115
- We’re not finished discussing this. 
- There’s nothing to discuss.

704
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:11,733
Rory’s waiting. I’ll see you Friday.

705
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,175
- Ooh, I got you a present. 
- What?

706
00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:21,460
In my purse.

707
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:27,472
- Cardio Salsa. 
- Yeah, they play the Miami Sound Machine

708
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,649
and you dance around, you get a really great workout.

709
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,557
- Why would you buy me this? 
- Because I’ll feel stupid doing in alone.

710
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,092
- Too bad. 
- Come on.

711
00:32:34,175 --> 00:32:34,862
No way.

712
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:37,069
Salsa with me. Pretend I’m Antonio Banderas.

713
00:32:37,145 --> 00:32:39,003
If you were standing in back of Antonio Banderas,

714
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,149
I couldn’t pretend that you were Antonio Banderas.

715
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:43,335
Don’t you want your mother to live a long and healthy life?

716
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:45,260
- Not if I have to do Cardio Salsa. 
- What?

717
00:32:45,352 --> 00:32:46,878
Nice knowing you, senora. Adios.

718
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:49,659
- I would salsa for you. 
- Well, luckily, you’ll never have to.

719
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:54,830
Hello... oh, Dwight, hi, it’s nice to hear from you, too...

720
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,083
Yeah, hey, how did you get my cell phone number?

721
00:32:57,857 --> 00:33:00,151
Oh, yeah, gotta love that Babette, huh?

722
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,244
Oh, the lawn’s fine... okay...

723
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:04,273
Okay...

724
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,058
Sure, Dwight, you have a safe trip...

725
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,060
Yeah, bye.

726
00:33:10,443 --> 00:33:12,706
It seems that Dwight has been checking the weather reports

727
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:15,697
and Stars Hollow is going to be extra sunny for the next few days,

728
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:18,569
so he was wondering if instead of watering the lawn twice a day for fifteen minutes,

729
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,489
we could water it three times a day for ten minutes.

730
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:23,418
- He should really get a dog. 
- Only if that dog doesn’t mind using the bathroom

731
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,757
at the gas station ‘cause that lawn is definitely off limits.

732
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,665
True.

733
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:30,294
So, I have to get back to the inn... could you water for me?

734
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:32,056
It was your idea to do it.

735
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:34,277
I can’t, I have a China shipment coming in.

736
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:36,315
- Do it tonight. 
- Dwight says it needs it now,

737
00:33:36,408 --> 00:33:39,449
and if we let that lawn die, he’s gonna vibe us for the rest of our lives.

738
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:41,077
Not me, I’m going off to college next year.

739
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,276
You’ll be home for holidays.

740
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:43,054
Maybe not now.

741
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:45,154
You would stay away from me on holidays just because of Dwight?

742
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:47,345
Hey, nobody wants vibing on the holidays.

743
00:33:47,437 --> 00:33:49,807
Rory, please? I’m gonna be seriously late if I have to go all the way home.

744
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:51,784
- Fine. 
- Thank you.

745
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:54,155
- You’re my favorite daughter. 
- You say that to all your daughters.

746
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:56,792
Yes, I do, but I only mean it with you.

747
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,718
- Bye. 
- Bye.

748
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:01,232
Oh, Dwight, please, you are on a business trip – get a hooker.

749
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:04,370
- Hello? 
- Lorelai, good, I’m glad I got you.

750
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:08,605
I just wanted you to know that I am playing golf with Peyton’s father Brennan on Sunday.

751
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:09,689
Okay.

752
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:12,025
Wear sunscreen.

753
00:34:12,138 --> 00:34:15,179
I will call you afterward and we can evaluate how to proceed from there.

754
00:34:15,282 --> 00:34:16,209
What are you talking about?

755
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,210
Well, I’m not sure how much damage has been done

756
00:34:18,303 --> 00:34:21,769
so I need some time with the man to assess whether or not a simple apology will work.

757
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:23,419
- Apology from who? 
- From you.

758
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:25,199
- For what? 
- For the way you treated Peyton.

759
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:28,754
- Are you serious? 
- Of course I’m serious.

760
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:33,740
- Dad, this is none of your business. 
- It certainly is my business.

761
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:38,145
No, who I date or do not date is absolutely none of your business.

762
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,612
Peyton’s mother is in the DAR with your mother.

763
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,465
I know that.

764
00:34:41,543 --> 00:34:43,444
She’s also on the Opera Committee with your mother,

765
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:46,413
the hospital board with your mother, the horticultural society with your mother.

766
00:34:46,507 --> 00:34:47,847
I get it, they hang, what’s the point?

767
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:50,966
This woman is a very important person in our social circle.

768
00:34:51,057 --> 00:34:53,669
She may have taken what you did the wrong way,

769
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:55,743
which could affect her relationship with your mother.

770
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,434
Dad, all I did was not go on a second date with her fully grown son.

771
00:34:59,527 --> 00:35:01,365
There’s no way she’s gonna be mad at Mom for that.

772
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:05,809
Lorelai, you obviously do not understand the way things work in your mother’s world.

773
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:08,453
There is a certain protocol that must be followed,

774
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,305
social rules that dictate proper behavior,

775
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:14,325
and these rules must be very strictly adhered to.

776
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:16,701
Dad, I’m not going out with Peyton again, period.

777
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:19,174
Lorelai, let me tell you a little story.

778
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,555
Now, two years ago, Sally Wallington’s check for the winter formal bounced.

779
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:25,487
So?

780
00:35:25,635 --> 00:35:27,612
It took her two weeks to replace the check.

781
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:29,860
So?

782
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,841
When Sally attended the next DAR meeting, she was served the last cup of tea.

783
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:35,803
So?

784
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:40,628
Before this unfortunate incident, Sally Wallington always received the first cup of tea.

785
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:44,478
When she was suddenly demoted, your mother moved up to the prime tea spot,

786
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:48,078
and she’s held that spot ever since. Now, she’s very proud of that spot,

787
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:52,281
and now she’s afraid that this little incident may jeopardize it.

788
00:35:52,395 --> 00:35:54,703
Dad, I explained this to Mom and I’ll explain it to you.

789
00:35:54,857 --> 00:35:57,525
I’m not sixteen, I don’t live with you anymore, I’ve been making

790
00:35:57,596 --> 00:35:59,675
my own decisions, romantic and otherwise, for a long time now

791
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:02,609
and you can play all the golf you want but the subject better

792
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:06,562
be letting chicks into the Augusta Golf Club because my love life is officially off limits.

793
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:08,845
- Didn’t you hear what I just said? 
- About the tea?

794
00:36:08,943 --> 00:36:11,313
Yes, I heard it, and I’m sorry, but it sounds insane.

795
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:14,674
Of course it sounds insane! It is insane, that is not the point.

796
00:36:14,744 --> 00:36:17,689
- Okay, then what’s the point? 
- The point is your mother is upset,

797
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:21,231
and I don’t want her to be upset. Now, you may not understand her world,

798
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:24,090
I may not understand her world, but it is her world,

799
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:29,112
and in her world it is very, very important that she have the first cup of tea.

800
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:32,138
And I don’t care about your independence or what you told your mother

801
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:36,357
or anything else you have to say – if my wife wants the first cup of tea,

802
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:38,826
she’s going to have the first cup of tea, that’s it!

803
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,832
Now, I will call you after I play golf.

804
00:37:16,552 --> 00:37:19,142
Hey, it’s Dwight, leave a message, I’m listening.

805
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:23,683
Dwight, hi it’s Doris. Doris, your wife, remember me?

806
00:37:23,786 --> 00:37:27,150
The woman who was asleep in bed when you snuck out the window like a spineless little worm!

807
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:30,780
How dare you sneak out like that, you sniveling little pond scum sample!

808
00:37:30,858 --> 00:37:33,689
I should call Erin Brockovich to bring a lawsuit against your parents,

809
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:38,523
you steaming lump of toxic waste! You really thought you could get away from me? From me?

810
00:37:38,651 --> 00:37:42,057
I would’ve found you sooner if I had bothered to look, but now I have, I found you,

811
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:45,087
and all I can say is this – I want my board games back!

812
00:37:45,216 --> 00:37:47,775
I want them back and I want them back now! And I will hunt you down

813
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:51,390
to the ends of the Earth until I get them back – especially the Trivial Pursuit!

814
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,099
Whoa, gross!

815
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:21,508
Dean, please have your pager with you, please, come on.

816
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:27,254
Dean, come on! Damn you and your Unabomber tendencies!

817
00:38:28,298 --> 00:38:29,199
Aw man!

818
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:40,786
- Whoa, whoa, slow down. 
- Get out of my way.

819
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:44,315
- I like the new look. It’s very Blue Crush. 
- Hilarious.

820
00:38:44,442 --> 00:38:45,717
- What’s the matter? 
- Nothing.

821
00:38:45,988 --> 00:38:47,273
You’re walking pretty fast for nothing.

822
00:38:47,396 --> 00:38:49,967
Well, our president said exercise and I am very patriotic.

823
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:51,902
- And completely soaked. 
- Where is everyone?

824
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:53,372
- Who are you looking for? 
- No one.

825
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,231
Rory, stop. What’s the matter –

826
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:57,223
other than the fact that you’re obviously out of towels.

827
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:00,060
This guy moved in across the way from us and we said we’d water his lawn

828
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:03,167
and the grass can only be watered in ten minute increments, otherwise the lawn drowns,

829
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:05,881
and the thing is stuck and it won’t turn off and I have to find someone,

830
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:07,903
Luke or Taylor or... Where are you going?

831
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:09,024
Jess!

832
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:14,182
You don’t have to do this. I didn’t ask you to do this.

833
00:39:14,908 --> 00:39:16,797
I can just find someone else to do it.

834
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:22,287
- Aw, you made it look so easy. 
- Yeah, it was loose.

835
00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:25,061
You just had to press down and give it a good twist, that’s all.

836
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:27,100
- Well, thank you. 
- You’re welcome.

837
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:31,708
- So things are good? 
- Oh, yeah, really good.

838
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:34,785
- School? 
- Good.

839
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:37,406
- Still gonna do the Harvard thing? 
- Yeah.

840
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:39,455
Good.

841
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:41,759
Yeah, good.

842
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,420
So...

843
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:50,510
- My pager. 
- Yeah, I figured.

844
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,634
- Who is it? 
- It’s... Dean.

845
00:39:55,815 --> 00:40:00,949
I paged him earlier to come over and help me and he just got the message, so he’s...

846
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:02,686
- Coming over to help. 
- Yeah.

847
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:05,608
Okay.

848
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:23,710
- Hi Mom. 
- Hello Lorelai.

849
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:26,101
- Hi Grandma. 
- Hello Rory.

850
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,701
- That’s a pretty sweater. 
- Thank you.

851
00:40:30,075 --> 00:40:32,696
I do love you in blue, you should wear blue more often.

852
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:35,563
- Buy her more blue, Lorelai. 
- Oh, I’ll get right on it.

853
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:38,549
- So, I brought you something Mom. 
- Oh really?

854
00:40:39,091 --> 00:40:40,816
- Soda, Rory? 
- Yes, please.

855
00:40:41,186 --> 00:40:42,804
These are some pictures from Sookie’s wedding.

856
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:45,952
There’s a great one of you and Dad dancing. I put ‘em in an album for you.

857
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:48,416
- Well, that’s very nice, thank you. 
- You wanna see?

858
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:51,205
- I’m making drinks right now, Lorelai. 
- Right, later it is.

859
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:52,787
Here you go.

860
00:40:53,945 --> 00:40:55,809
- Here. 
- Oh, guess I’m having wine.

861
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:57,315
- You didn’t want wine? 
- Wine’s fine.

862
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,513
Give it back, I’ll get you something else.

863
00:40:58,676 --> 00:40:59,674
No, I’m good with wine, Mom.

864
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:01,472
I can make you a martini, would you like a martini?

865
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:03,715
No, I just – you usually ask me what I want,

866
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:06,044
and tonight you didn’t ask me what I wanted so I didn’t have a chance

867
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:07,971
to tell you how much I would love some wine.

868
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:10,995
- I bought some cheese to have before dinner. 
- Great, we love cheese.

869
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:13,495
- It goes great with wine. 
- I will be right back.

870
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:18,205
Boy, it’s cold in here.

871
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:20,592
It’s a lot colder where you’re sitting.

872
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:22,686
- She’s mad at me. 
- Yup.

873
00:41:22,824 --> 00:41:24,304
- Think she’s gonna be mad at me all night? 
- Yup.

874
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:26,158
- I guess I should go in there and talk to her. 
- Yup.

875
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,836
You wouldn’t wanna go in there and talk to her for me?

876
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:28,799
Nope.

877
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:30,633
Good thing you don’t get paid by the word.

878
00:41:30,744 --> 00:41:32,301
The sooner you get in there, the sooner you get cheese.

879
00:41:32,419 --> 00:41:33,086
Fine.

880
00:41:36,808 --> 00:41:39,566
- Need some help? 
- No, I’m fine, thank you.

881
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:43,949
- Mom, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. 
- Sorry for what?

882
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,927
Sorry about the whole Peyton thing.

883
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:49,444
- When I asked you for his number, I didn’t think... 
- Think about what?

884
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:51,825
Think about what would happen if things didn’t work out with us.

885
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:55,195
I mean, I know his mom is your friend, and I shouldn’t have even

886
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:58,210
gotten mixed up in this whole thing if I wasn’t prepared to remember

887
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:02,527
that what I do will affect you, and to me it’s just a Bowie concert,

888
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,728
but to you, it’s not. I was a little thoughtless and I’m sorry,

889
00:42:08,824 --> 00:42:12,542
but you have to understand that I was not lying when I said we had a bad time.

890
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:17,401
We had a really, really, really, really, really bad time.

891
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:20,632
I swear, it was one of the worst times I’ve ever had, it was awful.

892
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:24,077
Do you remember skiing with the Danners and their Dobermans?

893
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:27,032
- Oh, God, yes. 
- This was worse.

894
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,383
And, by the way, not just for me – it was pretty bad for him, too.

895
00:42:29,485 --> 00:42:31,712
It wasn’t like he was in love and I was miserable.

896
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:35,572
We were both in pain – deep pain, Marathon Man kind of pain.

897
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:41,323
But despite all of this horrible pain that we were both in, and would be in again

898
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,980
if we had to spend one more second together, if you really want me to,

899
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:48,180
I will go to the Bowie concert with him.

900
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:50,929
Well, your saying that means a lot.

901
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,950
Thank you, Lorelai.

902
00:42:56,229 --> 00:42:57,971
Borrow Rory’s sweater when you go.

903
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,578
Ground control to Major Tom...

904
