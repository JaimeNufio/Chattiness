1
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:04,993
- Hey.
- Hey, you back. Ready?

2
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:06,075
- Almost.
- Almost?

3
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:08,471
I just have to find my keys, and finish the laundry…

4
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:11,553
That doesn’t sound like almost, that sounds like we’re gonna have to speed to the movies,

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,482
park illegally, you hit the bathroom while I grab the popcorn,

6
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,743
we’ll meet back at the seats all sweaty and aggravated –

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,131
Well of course I’ll be aggravated, you forgot the Red Vines. No, no keys here.

8
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:22,756
You know the lights are on in your Jeep?

9
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:26,524
Oh yeah, the porch light’s out and it was dark so I left the Jeep on for the light.

10
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:28,767
- Could you lift, please?
- But the battery’s going to die.

11
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:33,516
Oh, no, I timed it. It takes 12 hours for the battery to wear out. I go to work at eight o’clock,

12
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:37,173
giving me two hours to spare and a whole day to recharge.

13
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,539
- Not here either. Down, please.
- Why don’t you just change the porch light?

14
00:00:39,617 --> 00:00:43,600
Have you seen how dirty it is up there? With those creepy moths that fly in your face,

15
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:47,004
and you could swallow one, and end up with some weird hand-to-mouth-to-moth disease –

16
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:48,827
- There’s no such thing.
- Oh, no?

17
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:50,767
- Did you see Mothman Prophecies?
- Yes.

18
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,676
- Oh, well, okay then. Did you see the sequel?
- There’s a sequel?

19
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,100
Yes. It is a heartbreaking saga in which Richard Gere gets a life threatening disease

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,791
- from changing a dirty porch light.
- There was no sequel.

21
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:03,363
- Well, it’s still really gross up there.
- How long has it been out?

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,527
- Uh, since Rory broke up with Dean, the first time.
- Not the sequel.

23
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:08,457
Yes, he was the last one to change it.

24
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:11,718
Jess never changed the porch light, by the way.

25
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:13,699
Okay, this room is definitely keyless. Kitchen!

26
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:22,169
- You left your keys in the stove?
- No, my socks.

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,298
Your socks, of course. How naïve of me.

28
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,407
It makes them warm and slightly toasty.

29
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:29,496
- Huh, that’s weird.
- What’s weird? There’s so much to choose from.

30
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,599
They’re still damp. I followed the recipe.

31
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,471
Bake at two-fifty, ten minutes on one side, ten on the other, they should be done by now.

32
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:36,213
- Think my oven’s broken?
- What about your dryer?

33
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:38,817
- No, dryer’s fine.
- I think we should get to the movies.

34
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,421
- All done, let’s go.
- Keys!

35
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,557
Ah, forget about them. I’ll just leave the door unlocked.

36
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,661
- You can’t leave the door unlocked. That’s not safe.
- Sure it is.

37
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:47,323
- Just because you say it’s safe doesn’t make it safe.
- If you build it, they will come.

38
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,114
Have you checked out the… Your keys are in the door!

39
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,427
Huh, they are? That’s right, I had to go in the back way

40
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:56,201
- because the porch light was out!
- They’re stuck.

41
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,994
Yeah, that happens.

42
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:00,615
There.

43
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:02,766
You ready?

44
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,503
I can never pick you up here again.

45
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:05,390
- I had a dream about you last night.
- If this gets dirty, feel free to keep it to yourself.

46
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:08,430
I dreamed that in spite of the fact that you knew I wanted to be assigned the religion beat,

47
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:11,420
you went behind my back to Doyle, cooked him dinner and stole it from me.

48
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,711
- It’s just a dream, Paris.
- You made veal parmigiana, and it felt very real.

49
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:17,917
I don’t make veal parmigiana. I don’t make anything, and I don’t want the religion beat.

50
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:20,350
- I want features, you know that.
- You say you want features...

51
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:22,249
- And I mean it.
- Dreams tell you things.

52
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:26,100
It’s our subconscious talking to us. Warning us, telling us about things that are happening.

53
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:27,550
- Paris...
- My dream was telling me

54
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:29,688
that you are stabbing me in the back with your veal parmigiana.

55
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:32,008
- Well I must have really overcooked it then.
- Let me smell your hands.

56
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:33,446
- Oh, go away!
- You used a lot of garlic.

57
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:35,366
- Bye.
- Rory, listen to me.

58
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:37,143
We’re close, like, friends,

59
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:40,666
and I would hate for something as trivial as competition for the religion beat to come between us.

60
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:43,994
- Oh, my God, I don’t want the religion beat!
- We could end up like the Van Burens.

61
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:46,560
- As in Mr. and Mrs. President?
- As in Abby and Ann.

62
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:48,719
- Right.
- Sisters in blood, but bitter rivals.

63
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,942
- They don’t even speak anymore.
- That’s ‘cause one of them is dead.

64
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,585
You don’t want the religion beat?

65
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:57,218
Oh! I’m sorry, you meant the religion beat – No! I don’t!

66
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,896
Tenora Thomas was in my dream too, she was pouring the wine –

67
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,899
Yo! Tenora! Where’s the fire?

68
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:04,087
- Hey Rory, did you see this?
- See what?

69
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,211
It’s no big deal.

70
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:07,403
Glenn here got himself published in the New York Times.

71
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,934
- You’re kidding!
- It’s no big deal.

72
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:10,413
It’s no big deal, he says.

73
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,751
Oh, but this is the article you wrote about the reprinting of The Anarchist’s Cookbook.

74
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,497
- It’s no big deal!
- This was in our last issue.

75
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,328
The Times picked it up. They do that every now and then, they pick up something

76
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:20,894
and they publish it, and that’s what they did with our boy Glenn here.

77
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,300
Please don’t pat my back again.

78
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:24,729
Well, congratulations, Glenn.

79
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:26,541
Don’t say it loud, people are looking.

80
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,774
- You should be proud!
- Why, it’s not even my best piece.

81
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:30,730
- It’s still pretty amazing.
- It is amazing.

82
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:35,879
It’s absolutely amazing that I spent all summer in Indiana working my ass off for the Muncie Messenger,

83
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:39,353
and you went from Star Trek Convention to Boba Fett Fan Club Symposium,

84
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:42,347
and yet, lookie here. The New York Times.

85
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:44,876
Isn’t that great, Rory? Aren’t you seeing how great it is?

86
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:46,801
Look! Get off my bus, okay?

87
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,992
I don’t know why they picked it, I didn’t ask them to pick it,

88
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:52,469
- I don’t even read the New York Times!
- You don’t read the New...

89
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,542
Well Glenn, it’s great, and we’re all just really happy for you.

90
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:56,396
Whatever.

91
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:01,819
Oh man, it’s R.W. Apple again.

92
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,035
God, does he have anyone else to talk to?

93
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:05,321
What?

94
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,221
It’s like Being There.

95
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:09,427
And he’s Chauncey Gardiner.

96
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:11,445
Hey, Doyle, you have to look at it this way.

97
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:14,901
You edited that piece, and if it hadn’t been edited well, the Times never would have picked it.

98
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:18,212
Oh. That’s a great way to look at it. Thank you!

99
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:22,304
You know, it’s because of me that he’s going to be Bob Woodward. I made it happen.

100
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:25,913
So, some day when I’m running the circulation desk at the Muncie Messenger

101
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:30,430
and Glenn is accepting his Pulitzer Prize, I can point up at the screen at the local bar

102
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,645
where I regularly stop on my way home to get drop dead drunk, and say,

103
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:37,248
I helped him get there. ” Then I can fall off my stool and throw up.

104
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:38,784
Thank you so much for that, Gilmore.

105
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:41,801
I never would’ve thought to look at it that way if it hadn’t have been for you!

106
00:05:59,259 --> 00:05:59,903
Hey Mom.

107
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,803
- So, how are you? Do you wanna laugh?
- Oh, laughing would be good.

108
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:06,525
Luke did the funniest bit before, I thought you would so be...

109
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,262
Would you stop? I did not do a bit.

110
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,877
What are you talking about? The bit! It was a riot.

111
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:13,539
It wasn’t a bit! I banged my head on the stove and it hurt like hell.

112
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:15,952
No… no, you said it funnier before. Do it again!

113
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:18,687
I told you, I never did it in the first place. You did it, it’s your bit.

114
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,524
How could it be my bit when it’s your head in the oven?

115
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:23,079
Exactly. My head, my conk, no bit.

116
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:25,481
Mom, just wondering, did you call for any particular reason?

117
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:27,175
Just checking in, seeing how you’re doing. How are you doing?

118
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,345
- I’m fine.
- Aw, what’s wrong?

119
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:31,276
What makes you think something’s wrong?

120
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:33,309
- You’ve got Bambi voice.
- I do not have Bambi voice.

121
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,242
- Spill, please.
- I’m just… really behind.

122
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:38,419
- Behind what?
- I’m behind at the paper.

123
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,169
Way, way behind at the paper.

124
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:43,584
Everyone else had these amazing, productive summers.

125
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:47,757
Internships at hometown papers, getting articles reprinted in the New York Times,

126
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:51,987
and me, the person who’s been talking about being a journalist her entire life, what did I do?

127
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:54,849
I wasted two whole months running away to Europe with Grandma.

128
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,141
Whoa, slow down. First of all, Europe – waste?

129
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,403
You had major invaluable experiences, the architecture, the food,

130
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,072
seeing my mother without her makeup on in the morning.

131
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:04,996
But this is the time for work, for learning.

132
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:10,454
I didn’t even consider and internship anywhere, I was so wrapped up in my own personal… whatever.

133
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:13,947
- I can’t believe I did this.
- Well, okay, let’s take a step back here.

134
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:15,835
- You say you’re behind...
- I am behind.

135
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:18,396
- So, you’ll catch up.
- You say that like it’s easy.

136
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,310
No, I say that like it’s what you’re going to do.

137
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:23,809
You’ve done it before. You were behind at Chilton – you remember?

138
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:25,694
And then you hit a deer, and everything was fine.

139
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:27,469
The two incidents were in no way connected.

140
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,491
- But you caught up, right?
- That was high school.

141
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:32,041
This is college, a very big, important college.

142
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:34,355
Okay, different school, but same Rory.

143
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:38,221
You’re great at the catch up thing, you’re the catch up girl”....

144
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:40,580
not to be confused with ketchup girl”,, ‘cause that’s not you at all.

145
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:44,375
You were strictly a mustard and relish girl from day one – there’s a little condiment humor for ya.

146
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,668
I’m really going to have to work – constantly.

147
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,156
Maybe I’ll have to look for something part-time at a local paper.

148
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:52,696
Good, that’s good… Or you could work for a fishmonger.

149
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,907
- What?
- ‘Cause there’s lots of newspapers there.

150
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,795
Ow! Geez! What the – Doh!

151
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:03,842
He did it! He did the bit! Luke, do it again. Do it louder for Rory.

152
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:05,060
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?

153
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,452
- You sound happy.
- I am, kid.

154
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:11,903
What?

155
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:15,363
Mr. Mailer, it’s just such a great honor to be doing this interview,

156
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,964
- so I just want to thank you.
- Can I give you a tip?

157
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:17,788
Yes, sir.

158
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,819
I wouldn’t start that way for a simple reason – I don’t trust compliments.

159
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:25,434
I’ve been getting them for years. Sometimes I deserve them, sometimes I didn’t.

160
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:29,197
But generally when people give you compliments there’s one of two things wrong with them.

161
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:34,279
Either they’re false, or what’s worse is they’re sincere.

162
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,562
They really mean the compliment.

163
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:38,725
And then they’re offering you their loyalty.

164
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:43,384
And I’m kind of a stingy… Well, I don’t necessarily want to give all that loyalty back.

165
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,857
So either way, let’s skip the compliments.

166
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:48,201
Let’s talk about, uh, what are you working on now?

167
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,942
I’m gonna say no to you, I can’t tell you what I’m working on.

168
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:58,062
A novel is like a secret affair, you don’t bring other people in on it.

169
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:00,962
Norman Mailer’s back, for the third time this week!

170
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:02,123
Yep, sure is.

171
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:04,597
This is so exciting. I’ve got to call and tell Rory.

172
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:07,919
You know, she read The Naked and the Dead while she was still wearing footsie pajamas.

173
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:08,939
Chicken’s burning!

174
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:12,068
This is our first step on the road to being Solon.

175
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:15,988
I mean, as soon as word gets out that Norman Mailer is having lunch at the Dragonfly,

176
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:18,857
it’s just a matter of time before the rest of the literati comes sweeping in.

177
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:19,568
Sounds great.

178
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:22,676
So, of course, we’ll have to keep Gore Vidal on the other side of the room,

179
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,131
but, you know, probably Gabriel Garcia Marquez will run interference for us –

180
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:27,990
Butter bath, boys, butter bath!

181
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:30,018
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

182
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,289
And I’m thrilled and delighted that Norman Mailer is coming in here every day

183
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:36,908
and sitting at a table for four and ordering nothing at all, but tea!

184
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:40,115
- Tea?
- Iced tea. Glass after glass after glass!

185
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:42,388
- I’m sure he orders more than iced tea.
- Are you, now?

186
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:46,567
All right, you make great iced tea. I mean, legendary, so can you blame him?

187
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:50,138
All I know is when Billy Joel came in to the Independence Inn he would pack it away.

188
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:53,375
Appetizers! Main course! Two, three desserts!

189
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:56,795
That was a man that knew how to eat! And he was almost able to hide it.

190
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,203
Yes, but have you ever read his novels?

191
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,292
This is a restaurant, not a coffee shop.

192
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,192
Come on, Sookie, this is fun!

193
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:05,084
We’re the cool place where Norman Mailer likes to hang.

194
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:06,635
It’ll give us street cred, you’ll see.

195
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:07,542
Fine.

196
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,055
We need some more iced tea.

197
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,093
Gee, I wonder who that’s for?

198
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:15,863
Lena, economic development. Seng, Woodbridge Hall.

199
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:19,473
Benji, legal issues. Paris, religion beat.

200
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:21,018
Me? Really?

201
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,646
Huh, I hadn’t thought.

202
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,088
All right.

203
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,549
Jerry, city arts; Rory, features; Glenn, crime.

204
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:31,703
- What, Glenn, you don’t want crime?
- I don’t care.

205
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:36,244
Maureen Dowd told me it’s all the same, not that that flirt has any idea what she’s talking about.

206
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,403
All right, that’s it.

207
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:41,202
Congratulations if you got what you wanted, and if you didn’t, I could care less.

208
00:10:41,294 --> 00:10:42,112
Get cracking.

209
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:46,660
Doyle, thank you so much for features beat. I can’t tell you how excited I am.

210
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:47,703
And please don’t try.

211
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:50,229
No, I’m gonna kick butt. You just wait and see.

212
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,547
You’re a reporter now, Gilmore. You’ve gotta learn to say ass.

213
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:53,464
I’ll work on that.

214
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:56,807
Hey, listen, um, I have about a million ideas for my first story,

215
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:59,254
so I was wondering if I could run some of them by you, see what you think?

216
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:00,627
Two minutes. Go.

217
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:05,239
Okay, well, first I thought I could do an update on unionizing the janitorial staff,

218
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:08,605
you know, a classic power struggle; haves versus the have-nots.

219
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:09,112
Okay.

220
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:11,267
Or – and I already have the headline for this one –

221
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:15,321
Yale’s Liberal Activist Network: A thing of the past?”

222
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:16,351
Catchy, catchy

223
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:20,620
Then there’s the issue of illegal music downloading on campus, which I imagine is a major –

224
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:21,905
- Oh no.
- What?

225
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,183
He’s back.

226
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,622
Doyle, my friend. You’re looking very, very well, how ya been?

227
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:35,019
I’ve been great, Logan. Great to have you back.

228
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,326
Yeah, well, I stayed away as long as I could, but the Yale Daily News called to me.

229
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:41,235
Oh, sure. So how’s everything? How’s the family?

230
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:45,177
Everything’s fine, the family’s the family… Ah, my desk. Beautiful.

231
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:49,273
Um, you know, Logan, I didn’t know exactly when you were coming back,

232
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:52,996
- and I gave out the beats.
- That’s fine, Doyle, I’ll take whatever you’ve got left.

233
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,236
- Actually, there’s none left.
- Perfect, just the one I wanted.

234
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:58,509
Relax, Doyle. I’m just here for the pretty picture in my father’s head.

235
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:02,938
- I’m not going to be any trouble at all.
- Oh, Logan, please. You, trouble?

236
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:05,744
Stop. We’re just glad to have you here.

237
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:10,177
Careful, boy, you might hurt yourself, kid. Better get back to work, right boss?

238
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:11,735
Rory, nice to see you.

239
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:15,722
You know Logan? How do you know Logan?

240
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,853
No, I don’t know him, I met him. A friend introduced us.

241
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,881
- So you’re not friends.
- No, definitely not friends.

242
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,198
That guy’s a real piece of work. He took last year off with a bunch of his friends.

243
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,472
He was going to sail Daddy’s yacht around till he sank it.

244
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:27,544
- He sank his father’s yacht?
- Right off of Fiji.

245
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:30,735
They spent six months of gallivanting and partying and God knows what in there

246
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:32,973
till Daddy sent one of his planes to bring him back.

247
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,537
- I’m guessing his father’s rich.
- His father’s Mitchum Huntzberger.

248
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,791
Mitchum Huntzberger? The newspaper guy?

249
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,790
The newspaper magnet. The man owns at least twelve different papers.

250
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:43,080
I’ve spent two years kissing Logan’s butt.

251
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:44,370
- Don’t you mean ass?
- Whatever.

252
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:48,205
Guess it’s time to pucker up again. Man, I hate those kind of guys.

253
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,404
- What kind of guys?
- Those privileged, white males.

254
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:53,904
Doyle, you’re a privileged white male.

255
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:56,248
Well, he’s more privileged. And way more whiter.

256
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:58,654
Why am I talking to you? Meg, why am I talking to Gilmore?

257
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:00,539
My story – we were picking a story.

258
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:02,449
Right. Well, they all sound fine to me.

259
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,061
Then I think I’ll go with the downloading story.

260
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,798
Good. Go with your gut. And get to work.

261
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:11,332
Hello, city desk? Smitty here, take this down. I got a hot scoop on a tall blonde

262
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:12,826
and I gotta put it to bed on the double!

263
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:25,770
How do you see your position in American letters?

264
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,914
I’m either the best, or I’m not.

265
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:30,152
And I have no idea.

266
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:33,194
And in fact I don’t even worry about it anymore,

267
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:37,435
because it doesn’t matter whether you think you’re the best, there are twenty of us around.

268
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:40,609
Twenty American writers right now – I could name them but I won’t –

269
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:44,187
who think they’re the best living American writer. And I’m one of those twenty.

270
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:47,112
On the other hand, I don’t want to make friends with some of those guys, because they’re bastards.

271
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:49,845
Okay, so who is your favorite author of all time?

272
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:52,865
- So, how are we doing over here?
- We're fine.

273
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:56,343
Hey, you know what goes great with iced tea? Pork tenderloin!

274
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,412
Maybe later, thanks.

275
00:13:57,489 --> 00:14:00,106
We have a great menu here. I'm holding a couple as we speak.

276
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:01,323
We're fine, thank you.

277
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,908
Okay. Hey, I don't know if the waiter told you, but today is Wednesday.

278
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:12,097
And on Wednesday at the Dragonfly we play a little something I like to call "Stump the chef"!

279
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:17,017
Which is me. And the way we play is that you name any dish in the world

280
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:20,113
and I will make it for you, and if I don't know what it is,

281
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:24,041
- then you get your lunch completely free!
- What the devil is she talking about?

282
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,279
Actually, you know what, could we have some lemon for the iced tea?

283
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,512
Lemon?... Oh, sure.

284
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,051
One plate of lemon coming up.

285
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,277
If you change your mind, I'll be in the kitchen.

286
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:35,653
You know, with the food.

287
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:41,283
I already have a ton of data and pages of research and, ooh, the best thing is,

288
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:45,429
Nancy, this girl on the fourth floor, her father was the guy who ran security at the gallery

289
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:48,704
when Lars Ulrich sold all his art and he said he would try to get him on the phone

290
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,271
- for an interview and I've gotta breathe now.
- I think that was a record.

291
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:53,999
So what do you think? You think it sounds big enough, important enough?

292
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,823
- Yes, I do.
- I think so too.

293
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:59,007
- I feel very, very good about this, Forester.
- Excellent to hear, Gilmore.

294
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:01,602
Monsignor, why is my asking you keep your cell on vibrate during mass

295
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,681
in case I need to fact check a quote outrageous?

296
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:06,928
Rabbi Feldman's doing it for me on Shabbat and he's flying against the Talmud there.

297
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,765
So, when do I get to read this story of yours?

298
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:11,991
Well, I figured I'll finish a rough draft in time for our date tomorrow night.

299
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:15,038
So you can have a romantic night of proofreading. Huh? Pretty hot, don't ya think?

300
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:18,582
- Yeah, listen...
- I'm kidding; you don't have to read it. I'll read it to you.

301
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:20,670
- I have to work tomorrow night.
- What?

302
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:21,449
Sorry.

303
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,809
But it's Thursday. Since when do you work on Thursday?

304
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:27,476
Since Taylor decided to cash in on the 24-hour trucker crowd.

305
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:30,619
- What trucker crowd?
- The trucker crowd off Highway 84.

306
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,993
Since when does the trucker crowd off Highway 84 come through Star's Hollow?

307
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,821
Since we installed an icy machine.

308
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:36,716
Wow.

309
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:39,916
Yep. I'm stuck here pulling the new shifts until we see how it's catching on.

310
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,504
- Sounds rough.
- Yeah.

311
00:15:41,622 --> 00:15:44,027
You haven't lived until you've heard Taylor belt out "Stand by Your Man".

312
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,394
- You deserve hazard pay.
- I've already submitted for it.

313
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:49,251
So, no tomorrow night. Bummer. How about Saturday?

314
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:53,102
Saturday I'm here. Uh, what about next week? I've got Tuesday and Wednesdays off.

315
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:56,367
I have this article, and I'm already behind on my reading. Next weekend?

316
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,533
Going to Maine for my grandparent's wedding anniversary.

317
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,093
- Well, it was nice knowing ya.
- Way to stand by your man.

318
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:03,745
- So I guess that's week after next, huh?
- Yeah, I guess so.

319
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:06,177
- I turn in my article on that Monday.
- Monday night it is.

320
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:10,193
- They say absence makes the heart grow fonder.
- Yeah. Sex can do that also.

321
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:12,337
- Amen, brother.
- Okay, I've got to go.

322
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:15,905
You have to stir the nacho cheese every twenty minutes or it forms kind of a rock.

323
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:17,759
- Go stir the cheese.
- Call you tomorrow.

324
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,732
Okay. Bye.

325
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:22,378
Did you know that priests have a fabulous sense of humor?

326
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:25,198
Just stay one lightning bolt's length away from me at all times please.

327
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,323
You want to go check out some Mormon bingo around 5th?

328
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,051
No thanks.

329
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:29,557
- How's your article coming?
- Very good.

330
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,523
Good. So you must have found a new angle on it. Right?

331
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:32,732
- Right. New angle.
- Yeah.

332
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:35,828
Downloading stories are everywhere and they all say exactly the same thing.

333
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:38,388
Downloading's up, CD sales are down, but up from last year.

334
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:41,921
It's not hurting the music industry but the music industry's hurting. Blah, blah, blah.

335
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:45,469
You know. It always seems like there's got to be more to it than that, but there never is.

336
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:47,327
But, you have a fresh angle. So good.

337
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:49,473
- Yeah. Good.
- Okay. I'll be back late.

338
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:53,651
If Rabbi Feldman calls, tell him I got the stats from Edward James Olmos' office, so I'm good.

339
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:54,910
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye.

340
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,088
What’s this? Never mind, I see the noted pink, thank you Lorelai.

341
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:02,648
- You’re welcome.
- Okay. I see a lot of growth this month.

342
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,246
The initial drop off, which we all knew was going to happen after the opening has sort of settled

343
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:09,330
and you’re doing a good seventy to seventy-five percent occupancy, which is pretty good.

344
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:12,477
Yeah, and the holidays are coming up, we’re booked solid the last three weeks of November.

345
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:16,491
Well that’s all positive news. So let’s just talk about the couple of things we can do to help till then.

346
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,831
- So, we need help?
- Well, yeah. Some.

347
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:22,093
It’s the first year, and you’re going to building the business so there’s not a lot of profit right now,

348
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,661
and personally I’d feel better if we could just lighten some of the financial load.

349
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:27,033
- Financial load.
- That sounds bad.

350
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:29,098
I could put in for overtime and I don’t.

351
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,317
Look, you need to get some of these burdens off you. For example, lunch.

352
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:33,198
What about lunch?

353
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:36,901
Well, breakfast seems to be breaking even, and you’re doing fine with dinner but, lunch?

354
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,009
- What about lunch, Ann?
- You’re hemorrhaging money at lunch.

355
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,302
You have a full staff for a basically empty dining room.

356
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:46,204
I think it might be a good idea to drop lunch until you get your occupancy rate up higher and...

357
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,261
Drop lunch, did she say drop lunch?

358
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:50,576
Just until we get our occupancy rates up a little higher.

359
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:51,580
A lot higher.

360
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,252
- I don’t understand. That’s the only thing we can do?
- Well...

361
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:57,806
I mean, I just think it’s extremely coincidental that the only thing we can do

362
00:17:57,883 --> 00:18:00,950
- to save the inn is to get rid of lunch.
- Well, I’m sure it’s not the only thing.

363
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:04,092
I mean, lunch is my thing. Why do we have to get rid of one of my things?

364
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,335
Why can’t we get rid of one of Michel’s things?

365
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:09,474
What things? I stand behind a desk and answer a phone.

366
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,455
What of mine can you possibly get rid of?

367
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,749
- The desk! Put the phone on the wall!
- What?

368
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,951
And write on your shoe, because he goes through a lot of paper.

369
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:18,756
- Okay! Ann, would you just, uh…
- It’s not fair!

370
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:22,366
It’s not fair that everybody else gets to keep their thing and I have to get rid of my lunch.

371
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:23,447
Sookie, Ann’s just trying to help.

372
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,255
- Oh, Ann hates me.
- No, I don’t!

373
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:28,320
Okay, Ann, how would you like to go in the kitchen and get yourself a cup of coffee?

374
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:29,469
- I don’t hate her.
- I know.

375
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:31,874
- Michel can you get Ann some coffee?
- Oh, absolutely.

376
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,224
And then I’ll go hang my phone on the wall.

377
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:39,508
Oh, I have to tell you, looking good is so important when you represent the face of the company.

378
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,108
I mean, I am the first thing that a customer sees when they walk through that door.

379
00:18:43,185 --> 00:18:44,890
Your suits are not a deduction, Michel.

380
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:47,214
- What are you doing?
- She’s taking my lunches away.

381
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:49,385
- She’s trying to help us.
- This is all Norman Mailer’s fault.

382
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:52,836
He just sits around, ordering nothing and yammering on and on and on.

383
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,008
I mean, so he was married to Marilyn Munroe. Who wasn’t?

384
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,395
That was Arthur Miller.

385
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:58,796
I’m going to kick him and pinch his nose.

386
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,520
Hey, get a grip. Sookie, we’re trying to launch a business here.

387
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,720
The restaurant is part of the business.

388
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,481
- I know.
- And cutting out lunch is not the…

389
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,514
Temporarily cutting out lunch. Temporarily.

390
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:13,383
Just until things perk up, which they will, and when they do, the lunches will go back, just like before.

391
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,906
- Sookie? Okay?
- Fine.

392
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:17,948
- Just give it time.
- Mmhmm.

393
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:20,985
And we’re going to leave Mr. Mailer alone, right?

394
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,797
‘Cause I don’t care how old he is, he can take you.

395
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:24,088
I know.

396
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,388
So, we’re booted up, and we’re searching the network for other clients, right?

397
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,676
And then you enter the album you want in this search field, right?

398
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,597
Let’s say, it’s the new Interpol, you heard it?

399
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:34,531
I think so.

400
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:38,116
A little less joy Division-y this time, more Nick Cave-got-mugged-by-Paul Weller

401
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:40,470
with some Seventeen Seconds-era Cure thrown in.

402
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:43,589
But anyway, for better quality you choose the file with the highest bit rate.

403
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:46,031
It’s a trade off ‘cause it’s a bigger file size.

404
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,449
The lower the bit rate, the smaller the file, but lower quality. Got that?

405
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,898
- Higher smaller, lower larger.
- Higher larger, lower smaller.

406
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:57,465
Ooh, check this out. I can download a band’s entire catalog with the push of a button.

407
00:19:57,542 --> 00:20:01,038
I’m gonna take down all twenty-two Chicago albums, boo-ya!

408
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:04,934
There’s Chicago One, Chicago Two, Chicago Three, Chicago Four… neat, huh?

409
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:09,554
- Yeah. Really neat.
- Chicago nine, Chicago ten… I hate Chicago.

410
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:13,927
Use a trombone, go to jail. But, my goal is to get it all, from Abba to Zappa.

411
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:15,650
There’s the Christmas album.

412
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:19,741
Um. Okay, that’s really fascinating stuff, but let me ask you,

413
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:22,030
- do you still buy CD’s?
- Yeah.

414
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,898
- Anything to add to that?
- CD sales are up this year, you hear about that?

415
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,925
- Yes I did.
- Down last year, up this year. Weird.

416
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:35,867
Oh cool. Here’s a 1986 bootleg of Chicago Live at the Cumberland Civic Center

417
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:37,841
at Portland and Maine, boo-ya!

418
00:20:37,924 --> 00:20:39,859
So, Len, tell me about when…

419
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:44,348
- er, ah… if…
- Yeah?

420
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:48,260
- Oh, I just, I lost my train of thought.
- I hate that.

421
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,733
You know what, I think I’m going go get a cup of coffee.

422
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,647
- Coffee sounds good. I’ll be back in a minute.
- I’ll be here.

423
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:24,797
Oops! Didn’t see you there.

424
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:26,753
Shhh.

425
00:21:35,706 --> 00:21:37,808
In Omnia Paratus!

426
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,644
Oh boy. Okay, hold on.

427
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,543
I get it, you’re ringing.

428
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:58,155
Howdy ma’am.

429
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:00,997
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

430
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:02,968
- Yes, hi, hello.
- Lor!

431
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:05,317
- Chris?
- I can’t get her to stop.

432
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:07,027
- Stop what?
- Crying, screaming.

433
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:09,824
She’s not hot, there’s no fever, and I can’t get her to eat.

434
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,866
- We’re talking about Gigi, right?
- Yes!

435
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:14,211
Okay, ‘cause, you know, Sherry’s really thin, so I...

436
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,758
- Are you sure she’s not hot?
- No, I already checked.

437
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:21,619
I don’t know what to do. She’s everywhere.

438
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:24,963
She won’t sit still, she keeps climbing out of her crib, she’s moving really fast…

439
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:26,867
Oh, Chris, honey, calm down. Where’s Sherry?

440
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:30,006
- She’s not here, she’s out again.
- When is she getting home?

441
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:33,386
I don’t know what to do. I didn’t know who to call, the nanny is not answering her pager,

442
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:36,278
and Sherry’s friends, they don’t have kids or like kids, I just…

443
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:38,137
I’ll be right there. Ah, bye.

444
00:22:44,204 --> 00:22:47,286
- I owe you so big.
- Wow, you look, uh, great.

445
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:51,803
Huh. How long ago did Axl Rose leave?

446
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,945
Yeah, the, uh, place is kind of a mess, I tried to clean up earlier

447
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:57,234
but she keeps climbing out of the crib, if she’s not climbing, she’s screaming…

448
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:01,116
I really don’t know what to do here. I mean, I keep thinking she’s hungry but she won’t eat,

449
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:04,173
and... Oh, crap. There she goes again.

450
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,886
C’mon, Gig, let’s go back in the crib, huh?

451
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:09,672
You tell him, girlfriend.

452
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,528
She hasn’t slept. She hasn’t slept for days.

453
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:14,926
- I’m guessing that makes two of you.
- Yeah, well…

454
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:18,749
- C’mon, Gig, just a little sleep, huh?
- Um, Chris, where is Sherry?

455
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:20,469
She’s, uh, away.

456
00:23:20,737 --> 00:23:25,113
Oh, c’mon, seriously Gigi. Five hundred bucks if you stay in there for ten minutes.

457
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,788
Hold out, kid, you’ve got him on the ropes now.

458
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:28,954
- She doesn’t need your help.
- No, she doesn’t.

459
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:30,003
Just… come here.

460
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:36,250
Hi! Oh, wow! I hear strained spinach is the new pink!

461
00:23:37,954 --> 00:23:39,219
It’s okay…

462
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:46,465
- There you go.
- That’s it?

463
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,206
- Yeah.
- You mean, she’s going to stay in there?

464
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:51,727
Yeah, until her hair grows long enough for the prince to shimmy up.

465
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:53,798
Come on.

466
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:59,803
Oh, God, I am so sorry, Lor.

467
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:02,039
Oh, for what?

468
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:06,013
Well, I hardly ever call you, or Rory, but the minute I’m in trouble…

469
00:24:06,356 --> 00:24:08,418
- Well, that’s what we’re here for.
- Yeah.

470
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:11,993
Well, I’ve been traveling so much, and then I get home to this, and I didn’t know what to do.

471
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:13,737
I swear, I didn’t know what to do.

472
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,570
Chris.

473
00:24:16,904 --> 00:24:18,342
- Yeah?
- Where is Sherry?

474
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,325
- Sherry is in Paris.
- Wow, lucky girl.

475
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:23,528
When does she get back?

476
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,274
She’s not.

477
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,210
She’s…

478
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:34,311
I got home from Seattle, and the nanny was here and she handed me a note.

479
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:40,773
It said that Sherry had been offered a job in Paris and she had decided to take it.

480
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:41,679
What?

481
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,234
She said she had put her career on hold for almost two years.

482
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:47,388
She said that I had been gone for most of that time, which, I guess is true,

483
00:24:47,475 --> 00:24:49,722
and she wasn’t going to let this opportunity pass.

484
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:54,863
She said it was my turn, she was sorry, but that she had to do this – for her.

485
00:24:54,986 --> 00:24:55,928
- Wow.
- Yeah.

486
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:59,107
- I’m stunned.
- Pretty much my same reaction.

487
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,729
But Gigi – she just takes off on Gigi?...

488
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:05,851
Okay, well. You smell as good as you look.

489
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:09,761
- I haven’t showered since Seattle.
- Really, well, I’m hot.

490
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:14,473
Okay, um, how about this for a plan. You – go take a shower.

491
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:17,702
And I will, um, order some food and start to clean up

492
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:19,573
- and then we’ll...
- Hey, I can’t do this.

493
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:22,372
Do what? Shower? Oh, you’ve done it before.

494
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:26,049
Just turn the water on, step in. Oh, no wait, remove clothes, then step in.

495
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:29,475
I can’t raise her. I cannot raise her all by myself.

496
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:31,733
- Yes you can.
- What makes you think so?

497
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:36,584
Because you have to, Chris. She’s your daughter, and you’re going to find a way.

498
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:38,839
- I did. I did it with Rory.
- Oh, you’re different.

499
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,982
- Yes, I was sixteen.
- No, you’re different, I mean, you’re special.

500
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:46,812
You’re stronger. You’re like a superhero with red boots and a golden lasso.

501
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:48,162
That was one Halloween, Christopher.

502
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:51,916
I mean, you raised Rory all by yourself, you had no one to help you and you didn’t look back.

503
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:57,436
That’s right. But if I had decided to bail on Rory and follow the Bangles around the world,

504
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,575
which is what I planned to do when the Demerol kicked in,

505
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:03,594
then you would’ve put on the red boots and golden lasso and you would have raised her

506
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,826
and everything would have been fine.

507
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:08,785
Except she wouldn’t have introduced you to anyone,

508
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:12,441
or let you go to the parent night at school ‘cause you looked so freaky.

509
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:15,359
- I don’t know.
- She is your daughter.

510
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:18,049
And I don’t even know her. I’ve been gone so much.

511
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:19,841
Well, welcome home, babe.

512
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,694
I don’t want to screw this up, Lor.

513
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:24,648
You’re not going to. I know you can do this, Chris.

514
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,593
You ever get tired of being my cheerleader?

515
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:28,790
Hey, as long as I look cute in the skirt I’m good to go.

516
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:31,980
Okay. Uh...

517
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:35,765
I really need to shower.

518
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,153
- Yeah. I’ll clear a path, and order some food?
- Yeah.

519
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:41,222
- No applesauce.
- You got it.

520
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:46,557
So, you really think I can handle this?

521
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,635
No doubt in my mind.

522
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:52,471
Go. I’ve got the crying.

523
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:54,713
- Hey, Lor?
- Yeah.

524
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:56,561
I don’t know what I do without you.

525
00:26:56,669 --> 00:26:59,204
Yeah, well, you’re going to find out real soon if you don’t...

526
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:03,278
Take off clothes, get in shower, turn on water. I’m going.

527
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:06,735
Just another manic Monday…

528
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:09,535
Gellar!

529
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,213
- Do you see what I have here in my hand?
- I’m busy, Doyle.

530
00:27:13,306 --> 00:27:15,781
- Rabbi Baron says he’s changed his number twice.
- Oh, please.

531
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:19,115
- Father Callahan is threatening a restraining order.
- If I had a nickel…

532
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:22,479
And the honorable Muhammed Abdul Aziz says that you stole his flip-flops.

533
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,897
What a lie. He leaves them out in his hallway

534
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:27,374
and I have told him a million times that people suck, and...

535
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:28,221
- Paris!
- What?

536
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:32,873
You have threatened, stalked and basically freaked out every religious leader within a hundred mile radius.

537
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:36,319
This paper has never received so many complaints in the history of its existence.

538
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:39,145
And how the hell did you get Jesse Jackson’s barber’s number? How?

539
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:43,012
Hey, you gave me this beat to find the story, not to cow-tow and make nice, and...

540
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,105
- Gellar!
- What!

541
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:46,358
- Way to go.
- Thanks.

542
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:49,329
- Don’t you dare give back those flip-flops.
- Not a chance, they fit perfectly.

543
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,083
- Hey, Doyle, I think I want to change my story.
- Yeah?

544
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:54,648
Yeah. The downloading story was a dead end, there’s nothing there.

545
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:55,811
- You’re telling me.
- What?

546
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:59,846
I got bored just hearing you pitch it. So what do you got now?

547
00:27:59,922 --> 00:28:03,608
Okay. Well, last night I was in one of the bathrooms over at Berkeley,

548
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:07,801
and this girl came in, slightly toasted, and she was wearing a full on ball gown

549
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:10,980
- with one of those plastic gorilla masks.
- Huh. Not something you see every day.

550
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:13,485
Exactly what I thought. So I followed her out to the parking lot,

551
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:18,078
and she got in this fancy black SUV, and said In Omnia Paratus”,,

552
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:20,392
which means Ready for anything”.. I know, I took Latin.

553
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:21,835
Quel impressed. Continue

554
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,748
All this seemed a little weird, but interesting weird, you know?

555
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:29,686
So, I don’t know. Maybe it’s all this hanging out with a real newspaper man like yourself,

556
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,276
but my antennae went up. I felt there was a story there.

557
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:34,589
- Did you catch the subtle sucking up?
- Caught it. Continue.

558
00:28:34,662 --> 00:28:39,296
So, I googled the phrase, not quite sure what I was looking for, but then I found this.

559
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,895
See, it links the phrase with a club here at Yale.

560
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:47,836
It’s sort of a secret society kind of Skull and Bones kind of creepy group dating back to the 1800’s.

561
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:51,398
This phrase was their motto. Now, that alone, not that interesting.

562
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,195
But here. Look.

563
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,703
I found this in a 1996 edition of the Yale Daily News.

564
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:04,240
It’s an article on whether or not this club actually exists.

565
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:07,286
The Life and Death Brigade. ” Yeah, I know these guys.

566
00:29:07,353 --> 00:29:09,269
- Oh, you do?
- Well, I’ve heard of them.

567
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:11,961
They’re apparently even more elusive than the Skull and Bones crowd.

568
00:29:12,037 --> 00:29:16,067
‘Course they’ve never been linked to masturbating in a coffin so I automatically like these guys better.

569
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:17,470
Hm. Well, what do you know about them?

570
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:20,727
Not much. Paper’s tried to track them down before, and we’ve gotten a few leads,

571
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:23,035
but no one’s ever gotten close enough to confirm anything.

572
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:25,693
We all know they exist, but, we don’t know they exist.

573
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,707
It’s all just too-too. God I hate those stupid clubs.

574
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:33,911
I want to do this story. I want to find this club, track them down, get on the inside.

575
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:35,857
- What do you think?
- Go with your gut.

576
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:39,256
You said that about my downloading story.

577
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:41,004
Hey, you don’t trust my gut!

578
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:45,354
Finally.

579
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:46,721
What are you doing out here?

580
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,186
Am I wearing the same thing I wore last Friday night?

581
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:51,099
What?

582
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:56,086
Halfway here I was struck by the overwhelming feeling that I wore this exact outfit to last Friday night,

583
00:29:56,142 --> 00:30:00,130
and there’s no way I’m going in there to see my mother wearing the same thing I wore last Friday night

584
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:02,430
because I may not remember but she sure as hell will.

585
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,914
- I don’t know.
- You don’t know?

586
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:06,754
- You don’t remember but you expect me to?
- Well, you look at me more than I look at me;

587
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:11,186
you sit across from me at dinner. You had more of a chance to imprint my ensemble in your brain.

588
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:13,095
- Sorry, no imprint.
- Oh, that hurts.

589
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,937
Oh, I’m sure you don’t remember what I was wearing.

590
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:17,262
- I most certainly do.
- Okay, what was I wearing?

591
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:22,177
You were wearing a lovely and delicately understated, uh, outfit…

592
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,699
- well, you were definitely wearing these arms.
- Oh, way to imprint, lady.

593
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,903
Stand I front of me, just in case.

594
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:28,993
Hello.

595
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:32,710
Hi, we should be on the guest list. Holstein and Liza are expecting us.

596
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,930
Okay. Let’s try it straight. Hi, we’re here for dinner.

597
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,127
I’m Lorelai the daughter, this is Rory the granddaughter.

598
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,286
Oh! Okay, I’m sorry. Right this way.

599
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:45,325
- She’s acting weird.
- She knows I’m wearing the same outfit as last week.

600
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:48,127
- She wasn’t here last week.
- The world’s small, maids talk.

601
00:30:48,243 --> 00:30:49,252
- About you?
- Yes.

602
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:53,031
Oh. With all that’s going on in the world, all the maids in existence are talking about you.

603
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,222
Huh. ‘Kay, now you’re making me seem a little stuck up.

604
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:57,490
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yes, a martini please.

605
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:58,396
Coke, please.

606
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,229
Oh, you know, maybe we should wait for my mother. Is she coming down soon?

607
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:03,410
- No.
- Oh. Okay.

608
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:05,724
Do you know if she saw what I was wearing through the window?

609
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:07,899
- Mrs. Gilmore isn’t here.
- She’s not?

610
00:31:08,084 --> 00:31:10,512
- Where is she?
- She’s at a dinner for the Children’s Hospital.

611
00:31:10,612 --> 00:31:13,613
- Oh! So she’s not going to be here at all tonight.
- No, I’m afraid not.

612
00:31:13,695 --> 00:31:15,545
Okay. Well then I guess we can just…

613
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:18,330
You know, we’ll just... go have dinner in the pool house with Dad.

614
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:19,409
- Oh.
- Oh?

615
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,524
- Mr. Gilmore is out of town.
- He is?

616
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:22,619
‘Till Tuesday.

617
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,492
We’ve officially become afterthoughts.

618
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,207
Would you like me to make you two something for dinner?

619
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:31,177
Um, well, since everyone’s gone, maybe I’ll just head back to school.

620
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:33,470
- I have a lot of work to do at the paper.
- Yeah. Okay.

621
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,399
That would be one option, going back to school.

622
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:39,332
However, another option would be staying here, ordering pizza,

623
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:41,811
and eating dinner on the living room floor on paper plates.

624
00:31:41,877 --> 00:31:42,875
You’re evil!

625
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,877
- Would you bring us a phone book, please?
- Right away.

626
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,058
- Get crazy!
- Okay!

627
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,564
We have to really live it up. Carpe Diem, baby.

628
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:53,223
- I’m touching the rug with my feet!
- Ooh, you’re perverse!

629
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,608
Hey, and when she brings the drinks, let’s not use coasters!

630
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,625
Hey, I wonder if there’s anything in here that we could un-alphabetize.

631
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:01,599
The rug is so soft! Oh, you would not believe!

632
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:05,234
Gluing everything in this room to the ceiling so that it’s in exactly the same place,

633
00:32:05,316 --> 00:32:06,709
but upside down, be going too far?

634
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:07,539
A little.

635
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:11,481
- So, dish?
- Absolutely.

636
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:16,028
- Sherry left your dad.
- What? When?

637
00:32:16,115 --> 00:32:17,200
A couple of days ago.

638
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:21,634
She got a job offer in Paris and she packed her tiny pants in a bag and bailed.

639
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:23,370
- What about Gigi?
- Left her with Chris.

640
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:24,604
- No way.
- Yeah.

641
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,031
He came home, and the nanny handed him a letter.

642
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:29,446
I can’t believe this! How could she just leave like that?

643
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:31,270
- I have no idea.
- How do you know all this?

644
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:32,954
- He called me.
- When?

645
00:32:33,045 --> 00:32:36,928
Yesterday. He was freaking out because he couldn’t stop Gigi from crawling out of her crib,

646
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:40,307
and you know, I do have to hand it to him, he gets extra points

647
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,766
for the very original duct taping of the diaper move. That place was a wreck.

648
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,507
- You went over there?
- Oh yeah.

649
00:32:46,628 --> 00:32:49,431
But I calmed him down, and, you know, we sort of got the place in order

650
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,239
and I think everything’s going to be okay.

651
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,921
I’m going to go back on Monday and just make sure that everyone’s still breathing.

652
00:32:55,003 --> 00:32:57,904
Oh. Well, that’s very nice of you.

653
00:32:57,993 --> 00:33:01,652
Well, your dad is going to need a little help being… a dad.

654
00:33:01,745 --> 00:33:06,953
‘Cause, I mean… well he was your dad, so…no newsflash here.

655
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:13,132
But you should see Gigi. She’s huge, and gorgeous, and a belcher.

656
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:16,707
Oh, great! Dinner is served.

657
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:55,407
It’s a beautiful one and a half mile hike, there’s a waterfall around this bend here,

658
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:58,556
and over here are some of the oldest birch trees in the area,

659
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:01,915
a rare butterfly nature preserve is off to the right here –

660
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:05,022
Oh, excuse me. Michel, would you take over?

661
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:06,580
Oh, yes. Of course.

662
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:12,007
Okay, so over here, by this semi-polluted brook,

663
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:17,873
you will find large scary spiders and a fascinating display of poison ivy.

664
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,373
Luke, slow down!

665
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:21,935
I can’t come now, I’m working.

666
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:27,490
He what? … Okay, fine. I’m on my way.

667
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,516
Yes, I’m running. My feet are going like a cartoon character,

668
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:32,988
there are dust clouds behind me and the background keeps repeating itself. Bye!

669
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,377
Which brings you to the rattlesnake curve,

670
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:41,502
where people have actually died painful but very picturesque deaths.

671
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:45,902
Lunch at the Dragonfly! Get your lunch at the Dragonfly!

672
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:49,723
You have not eaten lunch, till you have eaten lunch at the Dragonfly!

673
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:52,758
- I mean it, Kirk, get away from here!
- I am on the sidewalk, Luke!

674
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:56,168
You do not own the sidewalk! The sidewalk is for the common people!

675
00:34:56,255 --> 00:35:01,461
The everyman! And every man and every woman would like to have a delicious lunch at the Dragonfly.

676
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:02,717
I’m going to call the cops.

677
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,573
Cops get free pie! With lunch at the Dragonfly!

678
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:08,522
Uh, Kirk, what are you doing? You’re a giant hot dog.

679
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:11,554
Technically I’m a giant wiener. The costume tag says wiener”..

680
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,216
Get him away from my diner. I mean it.

681
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:17,846
Don’t you worry, Lorelai, I have no intention of abandoning my post,

682
00:35:17,924 --> 00:35:22,781
and I will not rest till every single person in Stars Hollow has tried lunch at the Dragonfly!

683
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,338
Kirk, I don’t understand this.

684
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:27,278
I’m trying to scrounge up a lunch crowd for you, so I figured I’d go

685
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:29,407
where everybody already has lunch and get them over to you.

686
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:31,608
And I’m doing a pretty good job, if I do say so myself!

687
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:34,241
But who asked you – ugh. Boy.

688
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:38,173
Okay. Luke, I’m very sorry, this won’t happen again.

689
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:42,314
Come on, Kirk. I’m sorry, but why a hot dog? The Dragonfly doesn’t serve hot dogs.

690
00:35:42,396 --> 00:35:45,474
- Well, the kiesch made me look fat.
- If I see him around here again…

691
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:46,821
You won’t. Let’s go.

692
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:49,290
This is as fast as I can go in this outfit.

693
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:56,260
It was funny, man, you should have been there.

694
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:57,548
Hey, Huntzberger!

695
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,823
- Hey! You waiting on me?
- Could be.

696
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:03,025
- Wow, I’m flattered.
- Your prerogative.

697
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,476
You here on business or pleasure?

698
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:07,167
I just thought maybe I’d give you a chance to respond to my article?

699
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,285
- What article?
- The article I’m doing on the Life and Death Brigade.

700
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,399
- Don’t really know what you’re talking about.
- You don’t?

701
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:16,766
Huh. I thought you would. It’s a club.

702
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:19,819
One of these super secret, super exclusive clubs here at Yale,

703
00:36:19,907 --> 00:36:23,751
membership spans a thousand centuries, secret handshakes and secret sayings,

704
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:26,138
and a lot of running around in circles in your underwear, that kind of thing.

705
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:27,745
- Sounds pretty secret.
- Yeah.

706
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:32,767
Anyhow, I’m doing sort of an expose on this one particular club and I figured,

707
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,712
since you’re in it, maybe you’d like to have your point of view included.

708
00:36:35,803 --> 00:36:37,171
- I’m in it.
- Well aren’t you?

709
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:39,342
I’ve yet to run around in a circle in my underwear.

710
00:36:39,418 --> 00:36:40,837
Well. Okay.

711
00:36:41,384 --> 00:36:45,363
I mean, I have proof that your grandfather was in it, which means that your father was in it.

712
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,787
Which should mean that you’re in it. But maybe not. Okay.

713
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,698
- Sorry to let you down.
- No let down.

714
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:55,096
It would have been nice, but I have plenty of stuff without you, and I’m sorry to have bothered you.

715
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:56,524
- You have plenty without me, huh?
- Oh yeah!

716
00:36:56,606 --> 00:37:00,656
I have the ball gowns, the girl in the gorilla mask, In Omnia Paratus –

717
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,347
very fancy catch phrase, by the way – the license plate on the black SUV,

718
00:37:05,443 --> 00:37:07,035
and about a dozen other little things.

719
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:10,512
I mean, getting an interview with an actual member would have been great.

720
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,683
- But I’m okay without it.
- Well, great.

721
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:14,982
Yep. Plus I’m completely onto your routine now.

722
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,068
- Wow.
- Yeah.

723
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,103
So I figure I’ll just track you, and you’ll eventually lead me there anyway.

724
00:37:19,182 --> 00:37:21,961
So, hey. I mean it would have been easier if you just would have talked to me now,

725
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:23,977
but I can do it the other way if you want.

726
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:25,206
- The other way.
- Yes.

727
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:26,676
- You tracking me.
- Yes.

728
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:28,917
- Following my every move?
- Yeah.

729
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:30,583
- I pick that way.
- Okay, but...

730
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:32,360
We can start right now, if you want. I’m heading back to my room,

731
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,807
I can keep the window open in case you feel the need to sneak in, and track me from the inside.

732
00:37:35,877 --> 00:37:37,546
- Thanks for the info.
- Absolutely.

733
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,529
And hey, good luck with that article. Sounds like a hell of a scoop.

734
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:48,267
Sookie. What was the first thing we agreed on when we opened the inn?

735
00:37:48,406 --> 00:37:50,776
- What?
- Keep Kirk away from the business.

736
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:54,627
Then I get a call from a not so jolly Luke and I run down there and find a giant hot dog

737
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:57,074
handing out ten percent off flyers for lunch at the Dragonfly.

738
00:37:57,156 --> 00:37:59,742
- Who was the giant hot dog?
- Kirk was the giant hot dog.

739
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:03,131
I didn’t tell him to dress like a giant hot dog. Why would he dress up like a giant hot dog?

740
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:07,340
Because it’s Kirk, Sookie – the giant hot dog suit was a given the minute you talked to Kirk.

741
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:08,655
I don’t understand what you were thinking.

742
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:10,898
I was thinking we need to drum up some lunch business.

743
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:12,885
- But, there is no lunch.
- Since when?

744
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:15,429
Since when? Sookie, we all agreed. Ann said.

745
00:38:15,516 --> 00:38:18,343
I did not agree. I did not agree to stop serving lunch.

746
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:21,794
Sookie, come on, it’s the only thing we can do! We have to.

747
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:23,472
You heard Ann, we can’t afford this.

748
00:38:24,621 --> 00:38:27,093
- Who’s all this food for?
- All we need is a little time,

749
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:30,416
and the people are going to come. And I paid Kirk out of my own money, by the way,

750
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:33,237
- so you don’t have to worry about that.
- I’m not worried about that, I’m worried about this.

751
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:33,856
What?

752
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:36,089
What are we going to do with all this food? Who’s going to eat it?

753
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:39,770
Why are there seven kitchen people working when the only person out there is Norman Mailer?

754
00:38:39,836 --> 00:38:43,114
- Hey, this is what I do!
- Sookie, we’re dropping lunch.

755
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:45,658
It’s just temporary, but as of now, I’m sorry but it’s gone.

756
00:38:45,735 --> 00:38:47,511
Fine. No lunch.

757
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:50,475
From now on there’s no lunch! Everybody stop what you’re doing,

758
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,704
because as of now there’s no more lunch!

759
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:58,602
Boys! Yeah! Sorry to break up the party, but as of now, there’s no more lunch!

760
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:01,837
Yeah! It’s been cancelled. You happy, Norman Mailer? Huh?

761
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:05,499
Lunch has been cancelled! That means no more iced tea, uh-uh!

762
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:10,220
No more lemon slices! No more hanging out at a restaurant, ordering nothing

763
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:12,555
because you’re Norman Mailer and you can!

764
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:15,693
I mean, that’s just like me coming into a bookstore, reading your books,

765
00:39:15,883 --> 00:39:20,711
without buying them! Hey, can I borrow this? Huh? I’m not going to pay for it, nope.

766
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:24,157
I’m just going to stand here and read! Ooh, yeah.

767
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,205
Someone sure likes to use his big words.

768
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:30,781
Can I get some more iced tea for the table? Excuse me, Mr. Mailer, I’m so terribly sorry.

769
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:33,971
Oh, yeah! Yeah! What? What? Ha ha.

770
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:36,098
Yeah, write that down!

771
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:38,098
What?

772
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:40,095
- This is his fault!
- It is not his fault!

773
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:43,955
He takes up space! He drinks iced tea! He scares the other people off.

774
00:39:44,016 --> 00:39:46,520
Sookie, he does not! Why are you being so nutty about this?

775
00:39:46,607 --> 00:39:49,035
I don’t know! I don’t know why I’m getting so nutty about this!

776
00:39:49,116 --> 00:39:53,360
I mean, I hear myself getting nutty and I know that there’s no one coming for lunch!

777
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:56,808
And I know that Norman Mailer is not responsible for no one coming for lunch!

778
00:39:56,898 --> 00:40:00,709
And I tell myself it’s just temporary, and there’s still dinner, and breakfast,

779
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:04,119
and that’s good, and I can do a lot with that, and I try to calm myself down

780
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:09,064
and that just seems to only make me crazier and all I want to do is cry, and scream,

781
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:13,099
- and Oh! My God, I’m pregnant!
- You’re pregnant?

782
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:15,705
- Ooh, I’m pregnant!
- Oh, oh.

783
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:20,615
Norman Mailer! I’m pregnant!

784
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:21,833
Congratulations.

785
00:40:31,315 --> 00:40:33,052
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

786
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:35,832
I think I had some bad host at one of the masses yesterday.

787
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:30,959
Hey.

788
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:35,706
- Is the hot dog with you?
- No, Kirk is at home.

789
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:37,718
- Good. Make sure he stays there.
- I will.

790
00:41:38,337 --> 00:41:39,351
So you still mad at me?

791
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,540
Nope.

792
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:42,638
- Seem mad.
- I’m not mad, just bugged.

793
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:45,643
Luke, I swear. Kirk will never bother your business on our behalf again.

794
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:47,379
- Oh, it’s not that.
- What then?

795
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:51,608
I’ve got this table of bozos sitting over there all day long ordering nothing but iced tea.

796
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,426
Why don’t we focus on writing?

797
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:57,346
You know, I knew you’d come up with a question like that, it’s like, why don’t you push my Cadillac for me.

798
00:41:58,418 --> 00:41:59,595
Aw, bummer.

799
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:08,695
Rory, hey! What are you doing here? I – uh, here.

800
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:12,304
Hey, it’s good to see you, kiddo!

801
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:15,499
Uh, come on in, sit down.

802
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:20,092
Uh, Gigi is asleep, which is basically a miracle, but what the hell, for you I’ll wake her up.

803
00:42:20,168 --> 00:42:22,651
- No, that’s okay. I can’t stay long.
- Well, some sit down.

804
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,812
- No, I can’t stay.
- Okay.

805
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,361
- I don’t want you calling Mom anymore.
- What?

806
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:29,467
- I want you to stay away from her.
- Rory, I...

807
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:32,646
Mom’s in a relationship now, and she’s doing really great.

808
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:36,138
He’s kind, and, well, he’s there. And she’s happy.

809
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:40,351
- I think that’s great, Rory. I...
- You’ll mess it up! You’ll mess everything up!

810
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,496
Because every time you come back, it always ends up the same way.

811
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:47,884
Mom’s crying and you’re not being there and I know it’s not your fault,

812
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:51,084
I know you don’t mean it to be that way, but that’s how it is.

813
00:42:51,144 --> 00:42:52,973
I just needed some help. That’s all.

814
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:57,965
Well, next time you need help, call a nanny, or a babysitter, or call me. Just leave Mom alone.

815
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:01,978
I’m sorry, I have to go. Kiss Gigi for me.
