00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,754
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,465
- What do you mean you had an accident?
- Jess swerved...

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,425
Jess was driving and had an accident?

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,094
If you hadn't brought him,
this wouldn't have happened!

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,179
This is my fault?

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,473
- Have you talked to Dean?
- He gets home tomorrow.

7
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,891
- What'll you say?
- I don't know.

8
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,936
Now I have to find Jess
and I have to make sure he's okay...

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,397
and if that cuts into your screaming time,
that's just too bad!

10
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,149
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you!

11
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,693
I can't believe
Luke would send him off like that.

12
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,487
I heard the kid wanted to go.

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,990
I don't know.
All I know is that Jess is gone.

14
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,576
Well, well, well.

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,496
What will we do
for entertainment around here?

16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,540
Beats the hell out of me.

17
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,298
- What?
- Nothing.

18
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,675
- Are you tilting?
- No.

19
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,510
- I think you're tilting.
- I'm not.

20
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,804
Want to hold on to my purse?
It might even you out.

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,348
Stop any time you like.
What are you doing?

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,226
I'll put a pen on top of your head
and see if it rolls off.

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,520
This is not how you console the injured.

24
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,522
You're right. I'm sorry.

25
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,024
- What about this?
- The Little Locksmith.

26
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,402
And I got it at the bookstore.
Paid full price.

27
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,237
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Feel better?

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,530
- I do.
- Good.

29
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,575
- Now can I put a pen on top of your head?
- No.

30
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,285
- Mom...
- Good. Hold still.

31
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,911
- Forget the pen.
- Drat!

32
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,956
When are you gonna tell me
what happened between you and Luke?

33
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,792
Was it bad? I'm sure it was bad,
but how bad is bad?

34
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:26,044
- It was nothing.
- Really?

35
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:30,299
Look, I was upset, he was upset,
we had a thing. It's over, we're fine.

36
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,925
- A thing?
- A tiny thing.

37
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,719
- A tiny thing?
- A thinglet, if you will.

38
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,762
You and Luke don't have thinglets often.

39
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,348
Everybody has thinglets.
Part of being a grown-up.

40
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,726
- What did he say? What did you say?
- Please.

41
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,769
Okay, fine. Just answer me this.

42
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,688
- We are on our way to Luke's?
- Right.

43
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,232
- When we get there, will we get in?
- Of course.

44
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,442
- We'll get served?
- Yes.

45
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,860
- We'll get coffee?
- Maybe.

46
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,069
- Refills?
- Eventually.

47
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,404
- Free refills?
- In a month.

48
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,323
The thinglet has grown into a thing.

49
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,576
Rory, Luke and I have fought before.
God knows we'll fight again.

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,828
But it's over. It's history. We'll go in...

51
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,789
he'll be crabby, I'll be adorable,
he'll forget everything...

52
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,834
- and that, as they say, will be that.
- Okay.

53
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,961
- Hey, is there a line?
- Closed.

54
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,171
- What?
- Closed.

55
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,548
- Luke's is closed?
- Luke's is never closed.

56
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,300
- I know.
- You sure it's closed?

57
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,346
First I read the sign, then I tried the door
in case it was some elaborate ruse.

58
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,806
- Designed to keep you out?
- There's precedent.

59
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,351
- Luke's gone fishing. That's great.
- It is?

60
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,895
Yes. He works hard,
he needed a break, he took it.

61
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,941
- I think it's good. Healthy.
- For who? I have blood sugar issues.

62
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,735
- Mom, it's because...
- No, it isn't.

63
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,987
- But he never...
- Well, now he did.

64
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,823
Rory, he took a trip.
Don't read anything into it.

65
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,284
- It's because of the other night.
- No, it isn't.

66
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,037
Even if it is, it'll go away.
Everything will be fine.

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,624
Speak for yourself.
I left my wallet in there yesterday.

68
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,021
- Why are we standing?
- The sign says, 'Wait to be seated. '

69
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,608
Yeah, but we are not automatons,
we are rule breakers...

70
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,027
and there are 50 open tables.

71
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,113
- You're exaggerating.
- One, two, three, four, fifty. I'm not.

72
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,032
I'm sure someone will help us soon.

73
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,869
We should be eating. I'm hungry.
This is crazy. Don't they want us eating?

74
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,456
Isn't that the point of The Hungry Diner?
To feed the hungry diner?

75
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,958
Or is the point to keep
the hungry diner hungry?

76
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,211
They should call it
The Eternally Hungry Diner...

77
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,547
- 'cause you won't get any food here, loser.
- That'll be quite a sign.

78
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,968
I'll give these paper-top turkey heads
three seconds to seat us or I'm gonna...

79
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,386
- Two?
- Yes, please.

80
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,596
- You'll what?
- What?

81
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,224
You said you'll do something
if they didn't help us.

82
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,391
- I did?
- Yes.

83
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,228
Then the waitress came over,
and you never finished.

84
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,647
Get some food into you.
You're imagining things.

85
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,649
- What would you do?
- You're getting screwy.

86
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,150
- Mom!
- I'm not your mom.

87
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,694
- Do you need help, little girl?
- Oh, my God.

88
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,821
- How's this?
- Perfect. Thanks.

89
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,616
- Can I bring you coffee to start?
- To start and finish.

90
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,409
- You need a little pick-me-up?
- Do I?

91
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,994
Back in a jiff.

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,373
When she comes back,
we'll hold her down...

93
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,291
and tell her ugly things about the world.

94
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,669
Get your daughter to help you
with your evil plan.

95
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,920
Make nice.

96
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,507
How convenient.
They have pictures of all the food...

97
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,260
in case you've been in a cave
for the last 50 years...

98
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,804
and have no idea
what a stack of pancakes looks like.

99
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,973
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Yes, sweetie?

100
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,393
- What are the tiny cups for?
- They're coffee cups. They're for coffee.

101
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,311
- Are you running out?
- I'm sorry?

102
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,106
Never mind. Listen, we are
very sleepy this morning...

103
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,900
so would you happen to have
something in a larger size?

104
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,736
Say, a mug, a tureen,
a small bowl of some kind?

105
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,655
- A coffee bowl?
- Yes, a coffee bowl.

106
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,449
- Two, please.
- We don't have coffee bowls. I'm sorry.

107
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,326
Then would you mind bringing...

108
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,412
- What do you think, two, three?
- Three's good.

109
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,372
Three of these cute little cuppy things...

110
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,333
and could you leave the pot
in the meantime?

111
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,670
It looks like coffee, smells like coffee.

112
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,673
- The comparison stops there.
- This sucks!

113
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,800
Just put a lot of stuff
so you can't taste it.

114
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:45,137
How will I fit my three sugars
into Barbie's Malibu Dream Cup here?

115
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,348
- It'll be all sugar and no coffee.
- You might prefer it that way.

116
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,768
- Well, well, well.
- What?

117
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,979
I'll be right back.

118
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,195
So, what's new for fall?
I hear the sailor suit is hot.

119
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,071
What are you doing here?

120
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:06,658
- Luke's is closed this morning.
- By the health inspector, no doubt.

121
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,621
This is where you have your breakfast?

122
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,248
- Until this morning, yes.
- How's the grub?

123
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,751
They make an excellent
egg-white omelet, no oil.

124
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,835
Really?

125
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,921
They use the spray... Can you leave now?

126
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,506
You never told me about this place.

127
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,509
You might eat here,
and there would be no corner of my life...

128
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,637
which would be free
of your incessant scrutiny.

129
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,722
What are you doing with the fork?

130
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,474
- Can I have a bite?
- What?

131
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,893
- Just a taste.
- Get away from me.

132
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,104
Michel, don't go! Come eat with us.

133
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,524
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Not really.

134
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,900
Good. It's a date.

135
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,985
- You, me, here tomorrow?
- Never.

136
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,243
- I'm beginning to like this place.
- I'm glad.

137
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,828
- Mom, I need to ask you a favor.
- Ask away.

138
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,122
I need you to get me out of dinner tonight.

139
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,834
Dean's coming and he doesn't know
about the accident.

140
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,877
If I'm not there the second he gets home...

141
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,380
then someone else will tell him,
and that would be...

142
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,714
Horrible. I agree.

143
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,217
- I really hate to ask you this.
- Forget about it.

144
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,468
- Really?
- Absolutely.

145
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,762
- Make things right with Dean.
- I appreciate this.

146
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,181
No problem.
It gives me extra time to work...

147
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,059
on my why-Rory's-wearing-a-cast story
for your grandparents.

148
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,312
- Yeah? What have you got so far?
- Really big bees.

149
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,692
- It's good you've got the time.
- Yeah, it is.

150
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,988
I'm so sorry Rory isn't feeling well.
Is it that flu that's been going around?

151
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,907
- Yes, it is.
- Horrible strain.

152
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:32,786
Bunny Carlington Munchausen has been
bedridden for two straight weeks.

153
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,581
It must wipe her out
just toting that name around.

154
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,209
Should I take a drink for Richard?
I hate to disturb him when he's working.

155
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,461
- He's working? Like, work-working?
- That's right.

156
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,923
His articles of incorporation
arrived last week. He's rented an office.

157
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,051
Your father is now the president and CEO
of the Gilmore Group...

158
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,429
an international insurance consulting firm.

159
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,222
Wow, that's great.

160
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,437
- What's his job?
- He's a consultant.

161
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,521
Meaning?

162
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,191
Your father is
an international insurance consultant.

163
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,359
Yeah, but what exactly does that mean?

164
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,154
He consults on matters
related to international insurance.

165
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,657
Wait. When Dad goes to his new office,
he sits down, and he...

166
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,452
Consults with international clients
on insurance matters.

167
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,871
I don't know why
we're not opening for Rickles.

168
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,540
- Damn it!
- Richard? Are you all right?

169
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,085
No, I am not all right.
That was Margie just now on the phone.

170
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,087
- How is she?
- Who is she?

171
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,631
You know very well who Margie is.

172
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,342
She's been your father's secretary
since you were a child.

173
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,719
Largie Margie.
Very clever when you're six.

174
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,889
In answer to your question, Emily,
Margie is well.

175
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,559
So well, in fact, that she has decided
not to join me in my new business.

176
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,645
- What?
- She's staying with the old firm.

177
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,773
But you were the only reason
she even had a job at that firm.

178
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,651
I went to great pains
to remind her of just that.

179
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,736
This is simply unacceptable!

180
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,364
You and that rotund ingrate
had an agreement.

181
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,659
- There was an agreement in writing?
- Not in writing per se...

182
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,827
but she helped me procure my new office.

183
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,163
She arranged
to have all my things sent over.

184
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,999
All that was left was for her
to accept my formal offer.

185
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,835
A generous one, if I may say so.

186
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,755
- And she just turned you down?
- She had the gall to counteroffer.

187
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,466
She kept insisting
that I match her current salary.

188
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,636
You weren't even offering
to match the poor woman's salary?

189
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,514
Lorelai, the Gilmore Group
is a fledgling enterprise.

190
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,308
I can't afford to pay Margie
her full salary right away.

191
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:22,020
But after 20 years,
where is the woman's sense of loyalty?

192
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,606
I don't know. Maybe with the company...

193
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,734
that's keeping her from
standing in line for government cheese.

194
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,903
At this point,
I don't know how to proceed.

195
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,030
- Of course you don't.
- I had counted on this.

196
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,282
Of course you had.

197
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,325
Perhaps I should reconsider going forward.

198
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,952
- That may be best.
- Excuse me?

199
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,913
- I can't do it without Margie.
- No one would expect you to.

200
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,248
You can't be serious.

201
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,542
I wonder if it's too late
to get out of my lease.

202
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,586
You should look into that immediately.

203
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,883
There is a baby here
desperately in need of some bathwater.

204
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,010
- What is she saying?
- What are you saying?

205
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,596
I'm just saying
there are other options to consider.

206
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,890
- Like what?
- Hire another secretary.

207
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,017
No. Your father's had other secretaries.

208
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,728
Three, in fact.
Each one worse than the previous one.

209
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,688
- Until Margie.
- Margie was a gem.

210
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,231
Margie did everything for him.

211
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,068
Yes, but there are plenty of
other Margies out there...

212
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,697
dying to be in that
co-dependent relationship with you.

213
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,574
You will find one. Trust me.

214
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,410
She may not be named Margie,
but if you pay her enough...

215
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,997
- you can call her what you want.
- I don't have time to find someone new.

216
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,209
The office is a disaster.
Everything is in boxes.

217
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,836
I don't know where anything is
or how anything works.

218
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,672
The computers, the phones,
even my office chair.

219
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,466
Okay, Dad, I'll tell you what.

220
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,052
Tomorrow afternoon
after my business class...

221
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,972
I will come to your office.
We'll get you unpacked and settled.

222
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,017
We'll find you someone as good as Margie,
or at least cheaper.

223
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,936
I hate to see you waste your time.

224
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,146
- I'll blindfold you then.
- I don't know.

225
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:51,610
There's another Margie out there.
Honest. Just give it a chance.

226
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,197
- An office without Margie.
- Seems inconceivable.

227
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,282
Dream with me here, folks.

228
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,506
Hi, Rory.

229
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,008
What happened?
What did you do to your arm?

230
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,176
Here.

231
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,970
- What is this?
- Just read it.

232
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,430
What's going on?
Tell me how you hurt your arm.

233
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,683
It's all in the letter. Read.

234
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,607
- I love you, too.
- Good.

235
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,862
- Now hold on to that feeling for a minute.
- Why?

236
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,656
- Just...
- Read. All right, I'm reading.

237
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,538
- What?
- Keep going.

238
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,671
- What?
- Turn it over.

239
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,511
What?

240
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,681
Go on. You have three more 'whats'
ahead of you.

241
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,979
It gets better at the end.

242
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,441
I'll just stand here until you get there.

243
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,004
- Is he really gone?
- Yes.

244
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,846
- Want to come in?
- What?

245
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:47,017
You can stay for dinner. My mom's
making a roast. You like roast, right?

246
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,062
Yeah, I like roast.

247
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,981
Okay. Come on.

248
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,867
Then we just watched TV.

249
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,870
You mean you 'watched TV?'
Use the air quotes, sweetie.

250
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:10,374
- His little sister was there.
- So you watched TV. Go on.

251
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,543
And then he walked me home.

252
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,211
- That's it?
- That's it.

253
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,671
- Did he kiss you good night?
- Yep.

254
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,464
- Didn't ask about the other night?
- No.

255
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,091
- Didn't ask about the car?
- Not once.

256
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,175
And Jess?

257
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,845
He just asked if he was really gone.
And that was it.

258
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,389
I thought he would yell, scream,
and want to break up.

259
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,933
- Instead, he gave me his corn.
- He did? When?

260
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,102
- At dinner.
- So you were already eating.

261
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:33,397
It wasn't just an out of the blue,
'I give you my corn. ' Got it.

262
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,108
Maybe it hasn't sunk in.
Maybe he'll be mad tomorrow.

263
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,443
Maybe he's even more terrific
than we thought.

264
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,405
- It's not covering the whole cast.
- Relax. I'm not finished.

265
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,283
- Do you really think he's okay with it?
- Sounds like it.

266
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,202
If the situation were reversed,
I wouldn't be okay with it.

267
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:50,831
If the situation was reversed,
Dean wouldn't let Jess drive his car.

268
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,667
I guess I should just be grateful, then?

269
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,211
- Grateful, absolutely.
- What are these?

270
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,755
These are résumés
for your grandpa's new secretary.

271
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,132
There are, like, 100 of them.

272
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,384
The world is full of eager, young people...

273
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,512
waiting to have the life
sucked out of them by Richard Gilmore.

274
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,599
Okay, I'm finished.
What do you think of that?

275
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:11,643
If we were gazelles,
we'd be eaten first at the watering hole.

276
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,271
Be thankful we're not gazelles.
Go take your shower.

277
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,774
You're starting to look like
you're starring in an independent film.

278
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:23,238
Dean knows you. He knows
you wouldn't do anything to hurt him.

279
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,782
So you're lucky. Just focus on that.

280
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,452
Jess is gone. Now you guys can start over.

281
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,497
And even though the box says it's safe...

282
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,459
I want you to keep your arm
out of the microwave for at least a week.

283
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,178
- Dad?
- Come in.

284
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,684
So, let me guess. The Wu-Tang Clan
had the office before you.

285
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,311
It's a bit disheveled.

286
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,773
- It's freezing in here.
- Yes, it has been since I moved in.

287
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,816
Did you try adjusting the thermostat?

288
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,818
Yes. That only seemed to make it angry.

289
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,697
You've been Nanooking it the whole time?
Sending for whale blubber and mukluks?

290
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,159
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You don't know what you're...

291
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,539
- The wind done gone.
- So it would seem, for the moment.

292
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,166
No, I turned it off. Let me show you.

293
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,211
- Do you want to get that?
- No, they've already hung up.

294
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:24,049
Next time hold an envelope
up to your head before you do that.

295
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:28,554
It's been doing it all day.
The phone rings once, then they're gone.

296
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,723
Because your messages
are forwarded to your voice mail.

297
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,725
See where it says voice mail?

298
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,520
- How could that happen?
- I don't know. Where's your manual?

299
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:39,106
- Manual.
- Came with the phone.

300
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,692
Probably has a picture of a phone on it.

301
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,195
Look what I found under your copper-ball-
glued-to-the-wood thing.

302
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,905
No, it's brass.

303
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:51,201
One of the firm's parting gifts
as they nudged me into retirement.

304
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,454
So in addition to being heavy and ugly,
it's also insulting.

305
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,082
- Quite.
- There you go. That should work.

306
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,710
- Want to call me from your office?
- This is my office.

307
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,921
- Whose office is that?
- Yes, excellent idea.

308
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,135
- That isn't me calling.
- Didn't think so. Should I get that?

309
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,386
Yes, please.

310
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,723
Hello, the Gilmore Group.

311
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,270
Mr. Henson. Why, yes, he just walked out.
May I take a message?

312
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,609
How are you spelling 'Larry?'

313
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,613
Traditionally? Great.

314
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,657
Okay. Thank you for calling. Bye-bye.

315
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:34,411
- Where the hell are your pens?
- Watch your language, young lady.

316
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,331
- What did Larry want?
- He wants to know where your pens are.

317
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,792
He wants you to call him.
Where are all the office supplies?

318
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,628
I haven't gotten around to that yet.

319
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,589
Before anything else can happen,
you need pens, paper.

320
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,258
You need everything else, don't you?

321
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,802
Especially since I may be tempted
to wash my hand.

322
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,931
- Where does one get these?
- Where did you used to get them?

323
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,725
- From Margie.
- From Margie. I saw that coming.

324
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,937
All right. Well, let's go.

325
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,780
Good Lord, this place goes on forever!

326
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:13,283
It goes on until chair mats and floor mats,
but if you're not careful...

327
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,662
you'll loop back into inks and toners
and be here all day. Stay close.

328
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,747
There's a seat in the cart
if you want a ride.

329
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:21,625
I'll pass. Look at the scale of this place.

330
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,419
No one needs all these options.
It's oppressive.

331
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:27,548
Hundreds of paper clips
in every conceivable color and size.

332
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,217
Who on earth would buy these things?

333
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,510
We would.

334
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:35,430
Now, what's the first thing you do
when you get to the office in the morning?

335
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,225
Well, let's see.
I return the calls from Asia first.

336
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,103
That's right, you make coffee,
so you need a coffee maker.

337
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:45,399
Let's see. Ugly, crappy, German, pretty.

338
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,651
Well, as long as it's pretty.

339
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,153
Why is everything worth having
just out of reach?

340
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:54,324
Is there no one here whose job it is
to actually assist paying customers?

341
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,369
No. That's how they can afford
to sell this baby for 40% off.

342
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,371
40% off? I had no idea.

343
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,751
Nicely done, Dad. You won't be sorry.

344
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,213
It's suddenly becoming clear to me
that I'm an old man.

345
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,925
I don't recognize half the whatsits
and doodads in here.

346
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,011
Here we have an assortment
of magic sticks...

347
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,555
and when you press down on paper,
writing comes out.

348
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,056
I know what pens are.

349
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,686
Good. Pick out your favorites, and I'll try
to figure out how to explain Liquid Paper.

350
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,313
You're cute.

351
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,734
- I can't possibly use all of those.
- You won't. You'll lose half of them.

352
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,612
Then you'll be really happy
to have the ones you have left.

353
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,071
Now, paper.

354
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,533
All right. This ought to do nicely for now.

355
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,535
Are you going into business
for two weeks?

356
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:41,622
You're building an empire.
Think big, Gilmore!

357
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,625
Plus, if you get the box, it's cheaper.

358
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,878
Hey, how do you
happen to know all of this?

359
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,213
It's how we do it at the inn.

360
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,341
You have to spend money to make money.
Tip from me to you.

361
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:53,759
Good point. What else?

362
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,637
- I strongly recommend a stapler.
- Stapler.

363
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,181
- Some extra staples.
- I'm way ahead of you.

364
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,601
- Good man. Post-its.
- My goodness, look at all the Post-its.

365
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,854
I had no idea they came
in so many shapes and colors.

366
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,565
I'm going to get a 12-pack for myself
in various hues.

367
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,859
- Wise move.
- And one for Emily.

368
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:14,446
She posts notes on her vanity mirror
to remind her of various activities.

369
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,907
- She'll think it's Christmas.
- Done.

370
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,992
Now, what else is on the hit parade?

371
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:23,455
Might be controversial, but I was thinking
of a three-hole punch if we can find one.

372
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,708
I think we're both up to the challenge.
Shall we?

373
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,175
- Dawn Powell? I've never heard of her.
- Nobody has, which is a shame...

374
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:39,096
because she wrote 16 amazing novels,
nine plays and there are some who claim...

375
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,474
it was Powell who made the jokes
that Dorothy Parker got credit for.

376
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:43,934
- Blasphemy!
- I know.

377
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,186
I won't hold it against her
till I have proof...

378
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,355
she was involved
with the smear campaign.

379
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,899
Look! They finally took
the boards off the windows.

380
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,360
- I wonder what it's going to be.
- I don't know.

381
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,446
- What's that in the corner?
- I think it's a bass.

382
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,324
It's a bass!
And there are guitars on the wall.

383
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,909
Oh, my God, it's a music shop!

384
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,204
Much better than the ceramic circus store
we thought was going in.

385
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:07,958
I can't believe it! Stars Hollow
has taken its first steps toward being cool.

386
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,168
I wonder when it'll open.

387
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,462
If you keep pushing on the glass,
much sooner than anticipated.

388
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,258
- Hey, hold on a sec.
- Why? What's wrong?

389
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,468
Nothing. I'll be right back.

390
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,307
- Taylor.
- Rory, hello.

391
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,559
Hi. Listen, I just wanted to...

392
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,854
- Just look at that arm.
- It's fine, really.

393
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,522
- Does it hurt?
- No, not much.

394
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:34,484
I hope you're not getting addicted
to painkillers like those Hollywood people.

395
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,695
I'm not. Don't worry.

396
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:39,323
Good, because pain
is your body's way of saying...

397
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,867
'I'm not okay now, but I will be soon. '

398
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,202
I will remember that.

399
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,663
You don't want to shut your body up
too soon. That's called death.

400
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:47,706
Right.

401
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,668
Taylor, listen, I just wanted
to apologize to you.

402
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,837
- About what?
- About the other night.

403
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:57,549
My car hit the bench that had
your brand-new Doose's Market sign on it.

404
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:01,178
I know how much that sign meant to you.
I am so sorry it was ruined.

405
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,138
Well, it wasn't your fault.

406
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,681
But my car hit the bench.

407
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,559
Your car hit the bench
because that Jess was driving.

408
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,019
Well, yeah, but...

409
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:13,190
That boy is a walking natural disaster.
They should name a tornado after him!

410
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,025
But he didn't cause it.

411
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,194
You don't have to explain a thing to me.

412
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:21,240
I know there's no way that you
would be involved in something like that...

413
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,617
if it weren't for that Sal Mineo wannabe.

414
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,455
Believe me, Chachi and Chachi alone
will be held responsible for that incident.

415
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,374
Okay? Good.

416
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,086
- Now, take a peach.
- Thanks.

417
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,216
- So, is he mad?
- No, not at me.

418
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,927
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah, that's good.

419
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,079
That's my home phone number,
my pager number...

420
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,456
my cell number
and a partial list of references.

421
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,543
I'll hang on to this,
but as I said before, we just opened...

422
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,212
so I'm not really looking
to hire anybody right now.

423
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,756
I am licensed to carry a gun,
if that will help.

424
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,884
You have no idea how much.

425
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,440
- Can I help you?
- No, thank you, I was just looking.

426
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,484
We like the looking.
It's the touching we're a little iffy on.

427
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,361
Actually, I was just going...

428
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,822
That would have been construed
as touching, huh?

429
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,324
- Yes.
- Right.

430
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:48,785
Oh, my.

431
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,330
That's a DW drum set
with Zildjian cymbals.

432
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:52,831
- It's beautiful.
- You play?

433
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,124
Oh, no. I wish.

434
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,209
- Sit.
- What?

435
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,211
- Sit down. See how it feels.
- I couldn't.

436
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,505
- Why, your legs don't bend?
- No, they bend.

437
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:03,634
- If they bend, then bend them.
- Well, okay.

438
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,349
- This is a good stool.
- Yes, it is. Here.

439
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,809
You can't sit down at a drum set
without your sticks.

440
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,978
Right, 'cause that would be stupid.

441
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,897
Remember, no touching.

442
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,571
- You look good.
- Thanks.

443
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:33,497
Granted, the European insurance market
still needs some restructuring...

444
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,084
but it's growing at a remarkable rate.
What am I basing it on?

445
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,753
Clive, surely you've seen
the latest Eurostat.

446
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,965
Yes, I've got it right in front of me.
Eurostat.

447
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,634
Yes, here it is. Let's see.

448
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,596
The highest contributions
in absolute terms...

449
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,684
were reached in the United Kingdom,
Germany, and the Netherlands.

450
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:59,147
Yes, I would have to look up those
specific coding and reference numbers.

451
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,193
Yes, I've got them right here.

452
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,737
For the year 2001.

453
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:08,991
Here they are.

454
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,411
Are you interested in the Netherlands?

455
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,246
That market will go through the roof.

456
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:15,873
Gilmore Group. May I help you?

457
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,666
Margie doesn't work for the company.

458
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:21,086
I'm the one who called to schedule
the DSL appointment. Well, no.

459
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,881
We really need the DSL line
installed today.

460
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,049
It's just awful being without it.

461
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:30,721
Okay, if you can make it before 5:00,
everything's good...

462
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,431
but any later than that won't work...

463
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,684
because the cable modem people
are dropping by about 5:05.

464
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:38,437
Thank you. That's great. Okay, bye-bye.

465
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,732
- They'll be here in 20 minutes.
- I must say, I'm impressed.

466
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,109
- I'm no Margie.
- Who needs her?

467
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,153
- Speaking of which...
- What's this?

468
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,780
The secretarial candidates
for tomorrow's interviews.

469
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,407
I've looked at them carefully...

470
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:53,327
and somewhere in there
is a Margie for the new millennium.

471
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,786
- I'll get it.
- No.

472
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,789
Get to know your new secretary.
I don't mind.

473
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:00,000
Gilmore Group. May I help you?

474
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,252
Yes. Richard Gilmore, please.

475
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:06,131
Certainly. May I ask who's calling?

476
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:09,593
- Emily Gilmore.
- And does he know what this is about?

477
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:11,136
I hope so. I'm his wife.

478
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:15,098
Richard didn't say anything
about being married.

479
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,476
- What?
- Mom, relax. It's me.

480
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,311
- Lorelai?
- Yes.

481
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:23,106
- You're crude and unprofessional.
- I'd like that on my tombstone.

482
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,316
What can I do for you?

483
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:28,820
I'm throwing a cocktail party at the office
on Friday to help launch the new business.

484
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:33,075
The caterers will be arriving
at 3:00 sharp to set up, so...

485
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,619
Are you writing this down? You should be.

486
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,789
- I'm scribbling furiously.
- Margie always wrote everything down.

487
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,499
Does this mean no Friday night dinner?

488
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,669
- It means we'll see you both at the party.
- Bye.

489
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:48,340
Rory, sweetie, hold on there, baby!

490
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:51,385
Hey, Babette. Is everything okay?

491
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:56,014
I should be asking you that question.
Come here! Let me see that arm.

492
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:59,643
You poor little thing. How you doing?

493
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,103
I'm doing fine.

494
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,356
Look at you being brave like that
after all you've been through.

495
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,110
- It's so hard being a woman, isn't it?
- I guess.

496
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:11,280
You got your morals, your standards,
and good common sense...

497
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:14,700
and then you meet some guy,
and all that goes right out the window.

498
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:18,662
For every good woman, there's a dirty
little wolf ready to lead her astray!

499
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:20,998
You can't help it. He's got the eyes...

500
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,251
the chin, chest hair you could carpet
your dining room with.

501
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:28,046
I mean, what's a woman to do?
We're not made of steel, for God's sakes!

502
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,841
I was in a cult once! Did I tell you that?

503
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:32,885
- No.
- I met this guy once.

504
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:36,180
Gorgeous, tan,
looked just like Mickey Hargitay.

505
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:39,391
We had coffee. He gave me a pamphlet.
Next thing you know...

506
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,518
I'm wearing a muumuu,
playing a tambourine...

507
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,897
- jumping up and down at the airport!
- I really have to get inside.

508
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,191
Sure, honey. Take good care of yourself.

509
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:50,235
And don't be embarrassed, toots!
This has happened to all of us.

510
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,073
Mom, are you here?

511
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:02,414
Hey, you. It's me.
I'm gonna be home late today.

512
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:04,416
Trying to find Grandpa a Margie.

513
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,087
Order pizza. Money's under the rabbi.
Hope your arm's feeling okay. Bye-bye.

514
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,577
- I have found my calling.
- What are you talking about?

515
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,038
I'm talking about my future, my path...

516
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,958
my destiny, my thing, my scene, my bag.

517
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,503
I'm talking about the number-one item
on my cosmic to-do list!

518
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:50,754
Which is?

519
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:52,923
- I'm gonna be a drummer!
- You're kidding!

520
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:56,426
I went into that new music store today.
I don't know why. I just had to.

521
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,638
Something told me, 'There's something
in there you need to see. '

522
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:03,141
And there it was. It was red and shiny.
I'm so excited I can't breathe!

523
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:04,768
- That's amazing.
- I know.

524
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,562
- How will you do this?
- I don't know.

525
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:08,480
- How will you buy a drum set?
- I don't know.

526
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,482
Even if you buy one,
where will you play it?

527
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:13,652
I don't know any of this,
but I will figure something out...

528
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:18,574
because I am Keith Moon! I am Neil Peart!
I am Rick Allen, with and without the arm!

529
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,909
Because I am rock 'n' roll, baby!

530
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,744
I'll call you later.

531
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,847
When she opened her own office,
she asked me to come...

532
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,141
as her executive assistant
and office manager...

533
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:47,019
- which was a terrific opportunity.
- I bet.

534
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:50,314
- How so?
- In that I was able to build that office...

535
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,775
and its staff from the ground up
and develop a system from scratch.

536
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,277
So you have a system.

537
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,030
Which helped double productivity
and billing hours...

538
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:00,866
but then she got pregnant,
and here we are.

539
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,619
Wow. Story of my life. Literally.

540
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:07,831
Well, thank you for coming in, Karen.

541
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,918
We'll let you know
once we make our decision.

542
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:14,129
Thank you, Mr. Gilmore.
It was a pleasure meeting you both.

543
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:16,173
Here. I'll walk you out.

544
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:20,719
Love what's going on with your shoes,
by the way.

545
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:27,184
- Hey, look what I found.
- Good. Lunch. I'm starving!

546
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,812
- Do you want to eat in here today?
- Sure. Why not?

547
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:33,690
Good, they threw in pickles like I asked.

548
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,443
It's great having this place
just across the street.

549
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,362
You'll never starve.

550
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:42,074
Maybe we should start a tab with them
so we don't have to pay cash every day.

551
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:44,159
- Already done.
- Amazing!

552
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:48,038
You're like the tiny fellow on that
M* A *S*H program. Always anticipating.

553
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,249
So, what do we think?

554
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,585
- Tasty!
- No, I mean about Karen.

555
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:55,087
- Who?
- Karen.

556
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,631
The woman who was here.
The one with the system.

557
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,216
Rather inexperienced, I thought.

558
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,927
Dad, she worked as an executive assistant
for six years!

559
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,471
She's young, and young women
tend to be flighty.

560
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:07,724
She worked for the same woman
for five of those six years.

561
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,435
This roast beef is delicious.
It's lean, it's tender.

562
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,604
- What did you get?
- Cheeseburger.

563
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:15,774
I may get one myself if we order
from the same place tomorrow.

564
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:19,278
Tomorrow? You mean
for more secretary interviews?

565
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,904
Whatever's on the agenda.

566
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,365
Dad, you've already seen three people...

567
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:26,160
who would be
absolutely perfect for the job.

568
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:28,453
You can't rush these things, Lorelai.

569
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:31,623
A man's secretary sets the tone
for the entire enterprise.

570
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:34,960
- I know that, but...
- It has to do with chemistry...

571
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,754
which cannot be manufactured
out of sheer necessity.

572
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,799
Besides, you and I seem to be doing
just fine for the moment.

573
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:43,927
Yes, for the moment.
But the moment is coming to a rapid end.

574
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,053
What do you mean?

575
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,681
I can't work here
'cause I have my own job.

576
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,141
I know that, Lorelai.

577
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,935
I need you to find an assistant soon,
like, now...

578
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,896
because I don't know when I'll come back.

579
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:56,190
I need to see more résumés.
In the meantime...

580
00:30:56,273 --> 00:31:00,152
- Dad, I cannot come back here tomorrow.
- I see.

581
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,280
I didn't mean that to sound so harsh.
I meant...

582
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:06,617
I know exactly what you meant to say.
I got the message.

583
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,579
Well, I won't keep you any longer.
I know how busy you are.

584
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,957
Dad, I didn't mean I have to go right now.
We can finish our lunch.

585
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,250
I'm finished.

586
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:18,253
Will you leave the phone number
of the sandwich shop for me?

587
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:19,796
I'll need it.

588
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:22,299
All the numbers you need
are there on your desk.

589
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:24,384
Good. Now, if you'll excuse me...

590
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:28,722
I have some of my own work to attend to.
Thank you for all your help.

591
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,773
Dad, if it makes any difference,
I thought that Karen was...

592
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,191
Thank you.

593
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:44,822
Here.

594
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,866
You know, there will be food there.

595
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,078
Finger food, a. k. a.
'Snooty little balls of attitude. '

596
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:55,207
- Oh, boy.
- I need real food. Peasant food!

597
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:59,545
Hearty bread, meat, cheese,
little pickle chips, a sauce!

598
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:02,881
A special sauce. This is the food
that sustains me. The food...

599
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:04,550
Just eat the burger already!

600
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,552
- Crabby!
- I'm not crabby.

601
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:09,555
- I didn't finish my special sauce speech!
- Sorry.

602
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,766
- Does your arm hurt?
- No, I'm just tired, I guess.

603
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,143
All right, we won't stay very long.

604
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:18,480
Just long enough to get five or six
withering stares from my dad...

605
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:22,359
and be taken down three or four notches
by my mother. Then we're out of there.

606
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,113
- Not good?
- Really not good.

607
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,908
I swear, Luke better come back soon,
or I'm gonna starve to death.

608
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:33,871
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

609
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,957
- Luke's gone because of me.
- Honey, he is not!

610
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,918
Yes, he is. I got into an accident,
and you guys had a fight.

611
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,671
Rory, it isn't your fault!
If it's anyone's fault...

612
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,464
- Jess' fault.
- Well, yes!

613
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,759
Why does everyone in this town
think that it is all Jess' fault?

614
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:51,013
- Let's not talk about this, okay?
- I was there too, you know!

615
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:53,307
Rory, everyone here loves you.

616
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,852
They know you're not the
get-in-an-accident-knock-over-a-bench girl.

617
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,979
I know that and I appreciate that, but...

618
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:03,066
I want you to stop beating yourself up
about this. It's over! Jess is gone.

619
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,277
Let's forget about this, okay? Please?

620
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,404
- Fine.
- Good.

621
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,741
- Can you hand me that burger?
- You said it was bad.

622
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:15,078
That burger may be a disgusting burger,
but it considers me its equal.

623
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,795
Oh, jeez, this is worse than the clowns
in the Volkswagen.

624
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,757
- A lot of people.
- Do you want something to drink?

625
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,759
We're three martinis behind everyone else.

626
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,719
- Just water, I guess.
- Coming up.

627
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:33,722
I should have brought breadcrumbs.
Excuse me.

628
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:39,728
Lorelai, there you are. You're late.

629
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:42,147
You scheduled this beer bash
during rush hour.

630
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:43,774
When traffic is leaving Hartford.

631
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:46,151
Not when Emily Gilmore
is throwing a party.

632
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,570
Isn't it wonderful,
everyone coming for your father?

633
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:52,032
Yeah, but don't you ever think about
scaling back a little?

634
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:56,203
I scaled back a lot. I cut two appetizers,
I canceled the champagne fountain...

635
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:59,873
and I reduced the catering staff
to six servers, not counting the point man.

636
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:02,793
You can't not have a point man,
then what's the point?

637
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:05,838
If you make it look cheap,
people think you're unsuccessful.

638
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,130
Absolutely right.

639
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:10,384
Better to deprive them of oxygen
so they don't have to think at all.

640
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,970
- It is rather warm here.
- Want me to get the air going?

641
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,055
- No, Karen knows how to do it.
- Karen?

642
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:18,767
Your father's new secretary.
She's wonderful. Very professional.

643
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,103
Karen, darling, would you mind...

644
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:24,523
I'll have Karen draw up the contracts
in the morning.

645
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,818
- Hi, Dad.
- Lorelai.

646
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:32,406
- Swell party.
- Yes, it's mostly your mother's doing.

647
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,538
- What just went down there?
- Down where?

648
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:42,791
The handshake with the man
in the gray suit. Did you score a deal?

649
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,252
One doesn't score deals
in the insurance business.

650
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:49,006
One builds relationships based on trust
and fulfilling the client's needs.

651
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:51,800
- Mr. Lundquist and I just...
- Mr. Lundquist?

652
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,344
- Yes.
- Lindquist from Aero International?

653
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,180
- Yes.
- You bagged the Swede?

654
00:34:56,221 --> 00:35:00,309
Just as I didn't score a deal,
I also haven't bagged the Swede.

655
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,187
We simply talked. We came to
an agreement. We shook hands.

656
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:06,815
- You shook hands! That means...
- I'll send him the contracts in the morning.

657
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:09,276
- Dad, that's big!
- Yes, I suppose it is big.

658
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,778
That's gigantic!
It's a whole new market for you.

659
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:14,406
- It opens up all Scandinavia, doesn't it?
- Beyond that.

660
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,742
Lundquist is his company's rep
for Russia as well.

661
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,076
- Russia!
- Da.

662
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:22,247
- Look who's taking over the world.
- I suppose that would be me!

663
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:28,670
- I see that you hired Karen.
- Yes, I had to get someone in here.

664
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:33,467
- She seems to be working out well.
- She's no Margie, but we'll see.

665
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:38,138
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have several more deals to score...

666
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:41,099
now that I have finished
bagging the Swede.

667
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:48,440
- He's really in his element, isn't he?
- And happier than he's been in years!

668
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:51,735
There's Rory.
I was wondering where she's...

669
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:55,864
- What's that on her arm?
- I was gonna tell you about that.

670
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,699
- Hi, Grandma.
- That's a cast.

671
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,494
- That is a cast. She hurt her arm.
- When? How bad is it?

672
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:02,955
- I fractured my wrist.
- Oh, my God!

673
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,332
It's just a hairline fracture. It's tiny.

674
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,793
- When did this happen?
- Last week.

675
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:11,713
Last week? Why didn't you call me?
I can't believe you!

676
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,675
- Well, I meant to.
- How did this happen?

677
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,927
- Bees!
- I got in a car accident.

678
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,304
- What?
- I got in a car accident!

679
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,891
Oh, my God! How could you not tell us
she got into a car accident?

680
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:25,435
Is this why she missed dinner?
You said she had the flu!

681
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,104
I didn't want you to worry.

682
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,773
Clearly there was nothing
to worry about!

683
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:32,067
It was that car?
The one her boyfriend made.

684
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,279
Richard was dead set against letting her
drive that deathmobile.

685
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:37,656
- It wasn't the car, Mom.
- Well, then, what was it?

686
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,491
A friend and I went to get ice cream.

687
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:41,451
- Which friend? Lane?
- Jess.

688
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,120
- Jess?
- Luke's nephew.

689
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:46,331
Him? I thought you were going to
keep that boy away from her!

690
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:49,585
- Mom, do we have to talk about this now?
- Yes, we have to!

691
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:53,797
The child has a cast on her arm!
How could you be so irresponsible?

692
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,841
- Mom, please.
- Don't 'Mom, please' me!

693
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:59,178
It was your responsibility to stop this,
to make sure that...

694
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,014
I gave him the keys! I told him to drive.

695
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:04,349
He wanted to drive back to Luke's,
and I said no.

696
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:07,477
I wanted to keep on driving.
That's when we got into the accident.

697
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,314
This is just as much my fault,
as it is his. Maybe more.

698
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:14,735
I've got this, Mom.
Can I see you in the hall for a second?

699
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,200
- What the hell was that?
- I'm sick of this!

700
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:24,244
I'm sick of everyone treating me
like I'm a mindless idiot...

701
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:26,914
- led around by a guy.
- No one is treating you like that.

702
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:30,375
Everyone is. The whole town is.
Taylor, Babette, Dean.

703
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,961
Everyone, including you,
is refusing to believe...

704
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:35,506
I was as responsible
for what happened as Jess was.

705
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,049
Really? Were you driving the car?

706
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:38,967
- No.
- Then you weren't as responsible.

707
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,678
What if it was Dean?
What if Dean had been driving?

708
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:43,555
Would everyone assume it was his fault?

709
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:46,058
No, because Dean
wouldn't have been in an accident.

710
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,685
Dean is a much more
responsible kid who loves you...

711
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,771
and would drive more responsibly.

712
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:53,899
- How do you know that Jess wasn't?
- Hi. It's Jess!

713
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:58,153
Right, Jess is the Anti-Christ, I forgot.
He wanted to get into an accident.

714
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:02,658
He's a murderer with a death wish
and he wanted to kill us both, right?

715
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:05,786
I know you think that Jess is your friend,
but he's not.

716
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:09,331
He is a completely out-of-control,
really angry kid...

717
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:12,209
who has no respect for Luke,
who has no respect for me...

718
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:14,169
- It was an accident!
- And he was driving!

719
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:17,005
No matter what,
you're going to choose to blame Jess?

720
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,550
- Yes, I choose to blame Jess.
- Because you hate him?

721
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:22,719
That's right. I'm sorry.
When my daughter comes home broken...

722
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:26,849
I get to hate the guy who broke her.
That's how it works. He's gone. I win.

723
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:29,810
You are wearing a cast,
and I get to hate him forever.

724
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,395
- Fine!
- Fine!

725
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:40,279
I just had this image of 35 businessmen,
six servers, one point man...

726
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,198
all leaning against that wall
with glasses to their ears.

727
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:47,578
- I don't think they needed the glasses.
- We've got good lungs, you and I.

728
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,037
We'll never agree on this.

729
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,415
- You have to understand.
- I do.

730
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:55,085
- I don't want to fight about this anymore.
- Neither do I.

731
00:38:57,462 --> 00:39:00,465
- Do you want to go back inside?
- No, I want to go home.

732
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:02,134
My wrist hurts and I'm grumpy.

733
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:05,053
I just made a total idiot of myself
so I want to go home.

734
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:08,348
- All right, I'll tell Mom. I'll drive you.
- No, it's okay.

735
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:11,977
It's still early. I can catch my regular bus.
You go back in.

736
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,813
- Rory...
- I just want some alone time now.

737
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,774
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'll see you back at home.

738
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:29,912
It's after 6:00. We're closed!

739
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,206
- Five more minutes?
- Nope. Now!

740
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,628
- So, you're from New York?
- Yes, I am.

741
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:40,172
- I want to go to New York some day.
- Good for you!

742
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:41,924
- Did you like it?
- It was all right.

743
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,843
- What part of New York did you live in?
- What's your name?

744
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:47,596
- Lane Kim.
- Very nice to meet you, Lane Kim.

745
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,140
You have got to get out of here
because I am closing...

746
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:53,560
and you are not going to schmooze me
into forgetting that I'm closing.

747
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:54,728
- Wait!
- What?

748
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,689
- I have to have those drums!
- Great! Cash or credit?

749
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,691
No, I have no money.

750
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,402
Even if I did,
I couldn't take those home with me...

751
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:05,948
because my mother would
never stop crying. So I have a proposal.

752
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:09,076
Twice a week on Wednesday
and Friday nights at 6:00...

753
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,621
- I could come and practice here.
- Wow, that sounds great.

754
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:15,415
I'm not expecting you
to let me do this for free.

755
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:19,086
I'll clean or do inventory, or stock stuff,
or whatever it is you need done.

756
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,879
I don't need that much done.

757
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:24,508
I can do other things, also, like...
Hey, do you know Korean?

758
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,301
- No!
- Then I could teach you.

759
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:29,888
- Why would I want to learn Korean?
- It's an interesting language!

760
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:32,683
Being bilingual in this day and age
can only be a plus.

761
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:36,562
- Please, go home!
- I can't go home until you say yes!

762
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:40,274
I have to rock.
Please, I'm so begging you! Let me rock.

763
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:44,570
- Why Wednesdays and Fridays?
- That's when my mom has her Bible group.

764
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:51,243
- Okay, let's see what you got.
- Really? Oh, my God, thank you!

765
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:57,875
- Can I hit them this time?
- Go ahead.

766
00:40:58,417 --> 00:40:59,543
Yes!

767
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:06,341
I'll be in the back in case the cops come.

768
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:10,095
Do you mind turning off the lights
on your way out?

769
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,806
My mom sometimes walks home this way.

770
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:45,422
Hey. You back?

771
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:48,217
- I'm back.
- You catch anything?

772
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:52,971
No, apparently the fish went fishing also.

773
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:55,182
- Too bad.
- Yeah, well.

774
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,311
- So, that's the...
- Yeah.

775
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:02,981
- Does it hurt?
- No, not really. Just itches a little.

776
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:06,109
Yeah, I can imagine.
Make sure you don't use a pencil.

777
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:09,112
- Excuse me?
- Your arm, you know, when it itches?

778
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:12,449
I broke my arm once.
Itching drove me crazy.

779
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:15,828
Grabbed a pencil,
shoved it down the cast to scratch.

780
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,704
- Bad results?
- Bad results.

781
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:20,374
- Got it. No pencils, I promise.
- Good.

782
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:24,545
- So, you want some coffee?
- Sure.

783
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,180
Where's your mom tonight?

784
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:38,016
- At a party for my grandpa.
- Sounds nice.

785
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,437
Grab yourself a doughnut.

786
00:42:48,152 --> 00:42:50,279
So, have you heard from him?

787
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:53,949
No, I talked to his mom, though.
He got home okay.

788
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:56,368
- That's good.
- Yeah, good.

789
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,329
- What about his stuff?
- I'm gonna send it.

790
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:01,165
Right. Makes sense.

791
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,421
- Luke?
- Yeah?

792
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:11,717
- It wasn't his fault.
- I know it wasn't.
