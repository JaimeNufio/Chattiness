1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,156
This, boys and girls, is a story of true love.

2
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:12,950
A beautiful girl from one county,
a handsome boy from another.

3
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:14,911
They meet, and they fall in love.

4
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:18,997
Separated by distance and by parents
who did not approve of the union...

5
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:22,585
the young couple dreamed of the day
that they could be together.

6
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:26,922
They wrote each other beautiful letters,
letters of longing and passion...

7
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,133
letters full of promises
and plans for the future.

8
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:34,554
Soon the separation proved too much
for either one of them to bear.

9
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:37,974
So, one night, cold and black...

10
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:42,603
with no light to guide them,
they both snuck out of their homes...

11
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,231
and ran away as fast as they could.

12
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:48,984
It was so dark out
that they were both soon lost.

13
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:52,321
And it seemed as if
they would never find each other.

14
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:57,325
Finally, the girl dropped to her knees,
tears streaming down her lovely face.

15
00:00:57,535 --> 00:01:01,747
'Oh, my love, where are you?
How will I find you?'

16
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:05,917
Suddenly, a band of stars
appeared in the sky.

17
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:10,296
These stars shone so brightly,
they lit up the entire countryside.

18
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:11,756
The girl jumped to her feet...

19
00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:14,759
and followed the path of the stars,
until finally...

20
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:18,804
she found herself standing
right where the town gazebo is today.

21
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:21,932
And there waiting for her,
was her one true love...

22
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:25,227
who had also been led here
by the blanket of friendly stars.

23
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,357
And that, my friends, is the story
of how Stars Hollow came to be...

24
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:33,527
and why we celebrate that fateful night...

25
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,778
every year at about this time.

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,783
Now, we still have a little time left
in our story hour.

27
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:43,870
Who wants to hear about the time
I danced in a cage for Tito Puente?

28
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,329
Me.

29
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,957
It was the summer of '66.

30
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:56,522
So?

31
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:58,314
- It's depressing.
- It's beautiful.

32
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:01,818
- She throws herself under a train.
- But I bet she looked great doing it.

33
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:04,612
I don't know, I think maybe
Tolstoy's a little over my head.

34
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:08,199
No, that's not true. Tolstoy wrote
for the masses, the common man.

35
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:11,160
It's untrue that you have to be a genius
to read his stuff.

36
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:12,203
Yeah, but...

37
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:13,663
- I know it's big.
- Very big.

38
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:15,373
- And long.
- Very long.

39
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:18,876
Many Russian names tend to be spelled
very similarly, so it's confusing.

40
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,379
Every single person's name ends
with 'sky. ' Now how's that possible?

41
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:26,008
It's one of my favorite books.
I know if you just give it a try...

42
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,843
I'll try again.

43
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,094
- Really?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:30,387
You won't be sorry.

45
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:32,180
- Coffee?
- Please.

46
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,393
I thought Christmas was a big deal
around here.

47
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:39,729
This is a town that likes the celebrating.

48
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:43,566
Last year, we had a month-long carnival
when we got off the septic tank system.

49
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,152
- A month long? You're kidding.
- No.

50
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:50,740
There were rides, a petting zoo,
balloon animals, and a freak show.

51
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,534
Okay, you almost had me going there
for a second.

52
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:56,912
We did have a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

53
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:00,957
What are you doing Friday night?

54
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,752
I've got the usual
Friday night grandparents' dinner.

55
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:05,962
But I thought
if we get back early enough...

56
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,298
we should go watch the bonfire together.

57
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,218
I mean, it's kind of corny,
but it's really pretty.

58
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:13,761
And they sell star-shaped hot dogs.

59
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:17,389
How about if you get out of dinner
at your grandparents' this week?

60
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:20,184
- I don't think so.
- What if it's for a special occasion?

61
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:23,813
The occasion better include
my being relocated to a plastic bubble...

62
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,939
if my grandmother's gonna
let me out of dinner.

63
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:28,066
There must be another excuse
that you can use.

64
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,192
Like what?

65
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:32,529
Like it's your three-month anniversary
with your boyfriend.

66
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,740
- It is?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:36,282
Three months from your birthday.

68
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,992
That's when I gave you the bracelet...

69
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:40,703
and that's when I figure
this whole thing started.

70
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:41,871
Three months!

71
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,831
Actually, your birthday
was on a Saturday...

72
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:45,958
so it should be Saturday,
but I work Saturday...

73
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:49,336
and I planned this whole big thing.
So I thought we could do it Friday.

74
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,923
- What whole big thing?
- Just this once, miss dinner. Please.

75
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:55,884
Don't make me throw myself under a train.

76
00:04:56,677 --> 00:04:58,220
I'll see what I can do.

77
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,180
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

78
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:05,936
- It's our three-month anniversary.
- Yeah, it is.

79
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:09,439
- I feel stupid I didn't even know about this.
- That's quite all right.

80
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:12,484
I feel really bad
that I missed our two-month anniversary.

81
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,610
- Quite all right, too.
- How was it?

82
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:16,529
- Pretty good.
- I'm glad.

83
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:33,003
- No. Put that away.
- I want to cook.

84
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:34,254
- You can make soup.
- No.

85
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:36,506
I want to really cook
like on the Food Channel.

86
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,092
I want to saute things, chop things,
do the 'bam!'

87
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:42,887
I want to arrange things on plates.
I want to be the iron chef.

88
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,180
- Fine.
- Really?

89
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:45,973
- Yeah, I'll help.
- Okay.

90
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:49,018
- I need a pan.
- And a fire extinguisher.

91
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,728
Funny girl.

92
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:54,815
Now, if I'd only bought some hamburger.

93
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,818
- You didn't buy hamburger?
- Yes, I bought hamburger.

94
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:01,321
I just like saying things like that
so you look at me like I'm crazy.

95
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:04,825
So tell me,
why the sudden need to be domestic?

96
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:07,535
- I don't know. I'm in a funky mood.
- Why?

97
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,996
Too many stars, too much love.
It makes me cranky.

98
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,291
- So you haven't heard from Mr. Medina.
- No, I haven't.

99
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,085
- Maybe that's why you are cranky.
- New subject, please.

100
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,754
- You have a phone also.
- How's it coming with that pan?

101
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,339
Cleopatra, queen of denial.

102
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,383
- The pan. Please.
- Okay, fine.

103
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,010
- New topic.
- Thank you.

104
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,386
I have this huge favor to ask you.

105
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,723
Something I can hold over your head.
Let's hear it.

106
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,475
Friday night is Dean's and my
three-month anniversary.

107
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,894
Three months? Wow!

108
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,814
Dean apparently has some
big, fancy evening planned for us.

109
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,857
- Very classy of him.
- Yes, it is.

110
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,402
But for me to actually partake
of the aforesaid fancy evening...

111
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,904
I have to get out of Friday night dinner.

112
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,614
- Good luck with that.
- Mom.

113
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,075
Do you know how much
Emily Gilmore will not care...

114
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,702
about your anniversary?

115
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,244
You could talk to her.

116
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,747
If there was a runoff between what
Emily Gilmore would care about less:

117
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,584
A two-for-one toilet paper sale
or your anniversary...

118
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,669
your anniversary would win. Hands down.

119
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,006
- You won't even try to help?
- I'm gonna try because I care.

120
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,466
- Emily Gilmore, however...
- Phone, please.

121
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,385
Okay.

122
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,888
What?

123
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,724
Nothing. It's just...

124
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:19,770
'Mom, Rory and Dean are having their
three-month anniversary on Friday. '

125
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:22,898
'Really, Lorelai?
Why, that's wonderful. I'm thrilled. '

126
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:23,982
Stop.

127
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,819
'Three months.
Hold on. I'm going to cartwheel. '

128
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:29,905
- Forget it.
- No way. She's telling my dad now.

129
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:33,242
- I think they're cabbage patching.
- That's it. Find your own pan.

130
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:34,784
- Hello?
- Mom?

131
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:37,079
- Lorelai?
- Yes.

132
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,165
Hi. How are you doing?

133
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:42,292
- I'm doing fine.
- That's good.

134
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,418
- I'm pleased.
- And how's Dad?

135
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:45,629
What do you want, Lorelai?

136
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,757
I was just calling to say hello.

137
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,967
- And now you have.
- Okay, good.

138
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,594
Was there anything else
you wanted to add to that hello?

139
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:55,220
As a matter of fact, there is.

140
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:00,267
- You know Rory?
- Yes, I believe I do.

141
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,227
She wanted to say hello, too.

142
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,105
I'm late for a meeting.
I'd love to know why.

143
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:09,067
Mom, just hear me out, okay?
And don't say anything.

144
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:12,112
Friday night is Rory and Dean's
three-month anniversary.

145
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:14,947
While that might not seem
a big deal to you, it is to them.

146
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:17,909
I'm gonna ask you to do something
you are not gonna wanna do.

147
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:21,037
I'm begging you to look at it
from her point of view and maybe...

148
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:24,916
let her, just this once,
not come to dinner on Friday.

149
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:27,876
All right.

150
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:29,878
What?

151
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:33,965
Since this is a special occasion, it would
be fine if Rory missed dinner on Friday.

152
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,341
- It would?
- Yes.

153
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:37,344
- Are you sure?
- I believe I am.

154
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:38,678
- No arguments?
- No.

155
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:40,597
- She won't be there.
- I understand.

156
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:41,932
- At all.
- I heard.

157
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:44,016
- All night long.
- I assumed as much.

158
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:45,227
- Okay.
- Okay.

159
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,769
- All right.
- Anything else?

160
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:51,107
She's gonna need some help
getting ready for the big night.

161
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:53,192
- So I should...
- We'll see you at 7:00.

162
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:55,486
Okay. Right. Bye.

163
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:57,654
So?

164
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:59,699
The world is officially coming to an end.

165
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,911
- And they're off.
- The bell just rang three seconds ago.

166
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:05,537
How did they get lip-locked so fast?

167
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:07,164
I want a boyfriend to make out with.

168
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:08,499
Ty Tallson likes you.

169
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,542
I want a different boyfriend
to make out with.

170
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,503
- I can't get to my locker.
- They'll move if you ask nice.

171
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,464
You know, dangle a hotel key
in front of their faces.

172
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:19,217
This is a school.
You don't do this in a school.

173
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,095
Not unless you've got
a boyfriend like Tristan.

174
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:23,971
Then you do it anywhere you can.

175
00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:25,639
- Street corner.
- Shopping mall.

176
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:27,099
- Phone booth.
- Starbucks.

177
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:30,728
Thank you for the where-to-make-out list.
I just need to get my books.

178
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,395
Hell hath no fury.

179
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:37,067
Excuse me. You're in my way.

180
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:41,238
Spawn in front of
somebody else's locker, please.

181
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,782
I'm assuming your locker's in there
somewhere also.

182
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,741
Right behind Belle Watling.

183
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,161
- Have you tried to get their attention?
- Sure have.

184
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,704
- No luck?
- No.

185
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:53,958
God, look at that.
It's like he's eating her face.

186
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:56,294
Okay, that's it. I'm getting the fire hose.

187
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:58,003
Let me try first.

188
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:02,257
Could you move this whole thing
down to the left a little?

189
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:04,509
- What?
- You're standing in front of the lockers.

190
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:06,720
- Our lockers.
- Sorry.

191
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:09,306
- Just got a little carried away.
- Right.

192
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,810
- Hey, Paris.
- Hey.

193
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,771
You should get bangs.

194
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:18,148
Thanks for the tip.

195
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:21,400
You have a long forehead.
Bangs would hide that.

196
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:25,696
Party at my house Saturday.

197
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,198
Dress to impress, please.

198
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:29,157
- Come?
- I don't know.

199
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,410
- You could bring your boyfriend.
- I'll see.

200
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:35,122
- Meet me after Biology?
- And if I don't?

201
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:36,457
You will.

202
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,793
Yes, I will.

203
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,462
To be young and in love.

204
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:45,548
What a shame Elizabeth Barrett Browning
wasn't here to see this.

205
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:47,717
She'd put her head through a wall.

206
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,157
Now, people, this is a kitchen.
At least wear some hairnets.

207
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:16,953
- Hello. We were...
- Just discussing jam making.

208
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:20,665
Jackson's gonna start
making jam and preserves.

209
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,083
Maybe tomato sauce.

210
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:25,378
There's a whole world out there
beyond growing vegetables.

211
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,962
- No coffee?
- Sorry.

212
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:28,506
That's okay.

213
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:31,133
- Resume smooching.
- Thank you.

214
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:38,681
No, cherie. I can't wait either.

215
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:40,809
Very soon.

216
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:43,853
You are?

217
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,524
Don't tease me.

218
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,819
I promise all this waiting
will be worthwhile.

219
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:52,903
I'll see you then.

220
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:56,616
Goodbye, darling.

221
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:00,578
So how's Mom?

222
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:05,040
And while normally I would look forward
to a good verbal sparring match...

223
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,500
today I say no.

224
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:11,046
My heart is light, the world is fine,
and I have a date for Saturday night.

225
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,172
Your turn.

226
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:17,052
What I need now is lots and lots of coffee.

227
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,227
Heads up!

228
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,731
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

229
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,190
Man!

230
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:35,694
- That has never happened before.
- Really?

231
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:38,196
How about that.

232
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,417
I was almost crushed
by a papier-mache star.

233
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,044
- How's your day?
- It's looking pretty good now.

234
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,254
Coffee, please, and a shot of cynicism.

235
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:58,257
- Why so cheery?
- I don't know. I'm just in a mood.

236
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:00,593
There's no particular reason
for this mood?

237
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:03,554
- No. You don't believe me?
- I believe you.

238
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,098
You say there's no reason for the mood,
there's no reason for the mood.

239
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:10,018
- Simply nuts.
- Or bipolar. That's very big nowadays.

240
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:12,395
No, Patty, you're wrong.

241
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:14,856
They built the fire
to throw themselves on it...

242
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,232
when their families found them.

243
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,360
Taylor, you're crazy. They built the fire...

244
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:20,778
so they could stay warm
their first night here.

245
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:24,240
Patty, I am the recording secretary
for the Stars Hollow City Council.

246
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:26,700
I think I know how my town was founded.

247
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,121
Can nobody talk about anything else
but this stupid festival?

248
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:34,667
That came out a lot louder
than it was supposed to, didn't it?

249
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,628
This festival is commemorating
the founding of our town, young lady.

250
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:41,005
- I know, Taylor. I'm sorry.
- She's bipolar.

251
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,259
Really? But you're so young.

252
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,971
- Can I get you two anything else?
- No, thank you, sweetheart.

253
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:51,474
I don't know what's wrong with me.
This is a beautiful festival.

254
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:52,767
People should be enjoying it.

255
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:56,479
It's a crazy festival based on a nutty myth
about two lunatics...

256
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:58,940
who in all probability did not even exist.

257
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:03,236
Even if they did, they probably
dropped dead of diphtheria before age 24.

258
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,821
The town of Stars Hollow
probably got its name...

259
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:09,450
from the local dance hall prostitute.
Two rich drunk guys...

260
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:12,160
who made up the story
to make it look good on a poster.

261
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:14,871
You're full of hate and loathing,
and I love it.

262
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,332
It's good to have someone
to share this hate with.

263
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:18,416
My pleasure.

264
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,834
- More coffee?
- Please.

265
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,836
Tomorrow, if you have time...

266
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:24,964
I'm planning on despising everyone
who says, 'Hey, how's it going?'

267
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:26,424
You're on.

268
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,553
- Hey, how's it going?
- No, that's just too easy.

269
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,639
Rachel.

270
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,017
Your Rachel?

271
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:40,020
- You're Rachel?
- I'm Rachel.

272
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:48,069
What are you...

273
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,948
I mean, I thought you were
in the Congo or Philadelphia or something.

274
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:55,451
Actually, though very similar
to both the Congo and Philadelphia...

275
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,370
I was in the Mideast.

276
00:14:57,912 --> 00:15:00,164
Guess that postcard
must have gotten lost.

277
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:03,834
Yeah, things are pretty crazy over there.
Not a lot of writing time.

278
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:06,962
But I finished up my assignment,
I flew back to Chicago...

279
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:09,298
and I was walking through O'Hare,
and I look up...

280
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:12,842
and there's a plane leaving
for Hartford in, like, 20 minutes.

281
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:15,803
- All of a sudden, I'm on it.
- Nice story.

282
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:19,974
- I should have called.
- No, you... It's fine.

283
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,226
- You look good.
- Thanks.

284
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:25,522
You look...

285
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:31,902
- He thinks you look good, too. Right?
- Right.

286
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,737
- And you do.
- Thank you.

287
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:37,991
- I'm Lorelai.
- Yeah, she's Lorelai.

288
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:39,409
I'm Luke's friend.

289
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,663
Yeah, she works at the Independence Inn.

290
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:44,038
I run it, actually.

291
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:46,708
Sorry, she runs it.

292
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:51,003
I love that place.
That must be a pretty big job.

293
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,757
It is. It's crazy.
There's always something happening.

294
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,176
We put these coffeemakers in the rooms
and only half of them work.

295
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,179
They just shake and gurgle
like they're having a fit.

296
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:02,390
Why were you in the Mideast?

297
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:04,267
I was doing a photo story...

298
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,395
on how Palestinian and Israeli families
have been affected by the violence.

299
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:11,356
Well, so you understand
about the job pressure.

300
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:13,275
I'm gonna go.

301
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:16,361
- Please don't let me drive you away.
- That's okay, you're not.

302
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:19,281
I have to go sit in a closet or something.

303
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:22,325
- So, it was really nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

304
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:23,701
Okay. Bye.

305
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:36,547
'We got new coffeemakers. '
What was I thinking?

306
00:16:36,631 --> 00:16:39,633
You spent a lot of time picking out
those coffeemakers.

307
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:41,593
Yeah, I'm Mrs. Coffee.

308
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,014
- Okay, I'm still attached to the head.
- Sorry, I'm a little worked up.

309
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:48,808
- Mom, it's just Luke's ex-girlfriend.
- I know.

310
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:51,937
I just hate that I made myself
look so stupid in front of...

311
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,896
- Luke?
- No, Rachel.

312
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,815
She was standing there, fresh off a plane.

313
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:57,733
She had no plane hair at all, might I add.

314
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,944
- What exactly is plane hair?
- You know. It's all big and all...

315
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:01,988
Got it.

316
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,072
He's looking at her
like she's Miss September.

317
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,075
She's looking at him
like he's Johnny Depp...

318
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,537
and I was just babbling like a moron.
What is wrong with me?

319
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,997
Okay, you are now officially off hair duty.

320
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,249
- I'm sorry. I just...
- No, it's okay.

321
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,918
It's a little early
for Dean to see me completely bald.

322
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,212
Right. That's more a six-month thing.

323
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:21,172
- What's going on with you?
- I don't know.

324
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:24,300
It's just all this love in the air, you know.

325
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,886
I miss Max.

326
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,347
There's been so much going on
with your dad coming home...

327
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,683
and family stuff
and your constant existence.

328
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,518
- Thanks for the love.
- Any time.

329
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:37,688
I haven't had a lot of time to focus on it,
and I miss Max.

330
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:38,814
I know.

331
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:41,942
- I had a dream about him the other night.
- Really? Dirty?

332
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:45,070
Absolutely not. When you're 21,
I'll tell you the real answer.

333
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:47,114
Anyway, it's put me in a funk since then.

334
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:48,823
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

335
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:51,702
We could talk about me for years,
and believe me, we will.

336
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:54,203
But let's focus on you,
the lady of the evening.

337
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,872
- No hooker reference intended.
- Glad to hear it.

338
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:59,834
- What are you gonna wear with that?
- You tell me.

339
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:02,378
- Where is he taking you?
- Why?

340
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:05,339
You don't want to clash with the decor.
A lady plans ahead.

341
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:08,383
If you must know,
he's taking me to Andeloro's.

342
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:11,261
- Isn't that romantic.
- I know.

343
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:13,722
It's gonna be just like Lady and the Tramp.

344
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:16,725
You'll share spaghetti,
but it'll just be one long strand.

345
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:19,269
You won't realize it
until you meet in the middle.

346
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:21,938
Then, he'll push a meatball
towards you with his nose...

347
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:23,857
and you'll push it back with your nose.

348
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,901
Then, you'll bring the meatball home
and save it for years.

349
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:29,487
- Mom?
- Neither. Just wear your coat.

350
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,740
But your flower's just a little smushed.

351
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:34,742
Rory?

352
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,159
There you go. You're all set.

353
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,745
Is anyone here?

354
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:40,706
- You all right?
- Yeah. You look beautiful. Go.

355
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:45,335
Lane?

356
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:47,129
My God!

357
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:49,840
- I just can't believe it!
- I know.

358
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:52,967
Three months!
That's like one sixty-fourth of your life!

359
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:56,846
I have to stop hanging out with you.
You're making my life seem too pathetic.

360
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,389
Join the club.

361
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,433
Are you going to the festival?
We could meet you there later.

362
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:03,144
That would be romantic.

363
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:07,064
I'm going to the festival,
and would you like to know why?

364
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:09,608
- My mother has set me up again.
- Another future doctor?

365
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:12,611
A future chiropractor.
She's losing confidence in my prospects.

366
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:14,530
- Maybe he'll be nice.
- It's not just him.

367
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,781
We're going with his parents,
his grandparents...

368
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:20,118
two sisters, three brothers,
and at least one maiden aunt.

369
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:21,828
That's Dean.

370
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,997
Remember,
you have to tell me everything.

371
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,165
Okay, you, too.

372
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,501
Yeah, after the walking, the silence,
the sitting, and the bye-bye...

373
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,961
then the fun will begin.

374
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,629
I want to know, anyhow.

375
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,714
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, honey. Have fun.

376
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,843
Don't forget the meatball.

377
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,679
- The meatball?
- It's a mother-daughter thing.

378
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,809
So, think I could hang out with you
for a while?

379
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,938
Not unless you want to go to Hartford.
Besides, didn't anyone ever tell you...

380
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,441
it's not polite to keep
15 prospective Korean in-laws waiting.

381
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,361
You could run over me. Maybe my mother
wouldn't make me go if I was in hospital.

382
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,446
- I wouldn't count on it.
- You're right.

383
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:20,467
You're late.

384
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,344
- How did you do that?
- What?

385
00:20:22,427 --> 00:20:24,345
Answer the door
before I even rang the bell?

386
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:27,431
I thought I heard something.
I came to the door. You were there.

387
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:29,100
Come in, please.

388
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:34,772
- You thought you heard something?
- Yes.

389
00:20:34,856 --> 00:20:37,316
- Mom, that door is, like, 10 feet thick.
- So?

390
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:40,360
It wasn't like I was standing out there
with a band of jackals.

391
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:41,737
I was just drinking coffee.

392
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,822
Lorelai, what is it that you want to hear?

393
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:47,033
That I was standing by the window,
staring out at the driveway...

394
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:48,868
waiting to pounce
the moment you arrived?

395
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:52,455
Yes, because believe it or not,
that would be less creepy.

396
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:54,707
Get yourself a drink, please.

397
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:57,335
Hey, Dad.

398
00:20:57,377 --> 00:20:59,545
- Lorelai.
- Sorry I'm late.

399
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:01,756
I was helping Rory get ready
for her big date...

400
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,841
and, well, you know girls.

401
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:09,680
- How's work?
- Work is fine.

402
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:11,974
Yeah? Good.

403
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,893
My work's fine, too.

404
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:16,645
Oh, God.

405
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:20,231
Mom has gone a little crazy
with the figurines here.

406
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:21,358
A little Kathy Bates?

407
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:24,236
You probably haven't seen Misery,
which is a good thing.

408
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,572
'Cause Rory couldn't sleep alone
for a week after we watched it.

409
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:30,324
That wouldn't be a problem for you.
You don't sleep alone.

410
00:21:30,408 --> 00:21:34,745
I'm guessing. I don't know what
your and Mom's sleeping arrangement is.

411
00:21:34,787 --> 00:21:36,622
Now I'm wishing I hadn't brought it up...

412
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:39,583
because it's a don't-want-to-go-there
subject for me.

413
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,544
Not for you, because you should
definitely go there if you...

414
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:43,963
Well, anyway...

415
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,338
What have you done now?

416
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:48,092
I'm putting the bunny back
with his little friends...

417
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,593
and I just sort of massacred them
a little bit.

418
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:54,014
- But, that's life in the jungle, isn't it?
- Just sit down, please.

419
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:55,389
Okay. Sorry.

420
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:58,351
- Just sit with your hands in your lap.
- Sorry.

421
00:21:58,435 --> 00:21:59,978
And I'm trying to read.

422
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:03,689
So please, just be quiet,
and try not to break anything else.

423
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:05,524
We having a nice chat?

424
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:08,068
We're having a great conversation,
me and Morrie.

425
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:09,862
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

426
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:13,115
Thanks for letting Rory out of dinner.
She really appreciated it.

427
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,200
She deserves to celebrate.

428
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:18,829
A three-month anniversary
is a landmark feat at her age.

429
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:21,289
Or at any age, for some people.

430
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,626
I was gonna get a drink.
I'm gonna get right on that.

431
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,546
I'll get that.

432
00:22:30,423 --> 00:22:32,800
- Can I freshen up your drink, Dad?
- No, thank you.

433
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,844
One drink before dinner is quite enough.

434
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:36,179
Right. Sorry.

435
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:39,640
- I had no idea it was so close.
- Absolutely. Right around the corner.

436
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:41,266
What a small world.

437
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,186
Lorelai, I'd like you
to meet Chase Bradford.

438
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:48,273
He was telling me that he grew up
right around the corner from here.

439
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:50,275
- Really?
- Stone house on the corner.

440
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:53,653
- The one with the Dobermans.
- That's right. Leopold and Loeb.

441
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:55,780
I'm afraid they passed on a few years ago.

442
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:57,865
Postmen finally got organized?

443
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:01,619
Chase, this is my husband, Richard.

444
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:05,039
- How do you do?
- Fine, Richard. Just fine.

445
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:06,749
Please, sit down.

446
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,002
I didn't know we were having company
for dinner.

447
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:12,963
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

448
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:15,424
Chase's mother and I
are in the DAR together...

449
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:18,510
and he's moved back to Hartford.
It seemed like a nice idea.

450
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:20,137
Yes, very nice.

451
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:22,055
Can I get you a drink?

452
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,348
A Scotch, neat.

453
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,099
- Glenfiddich?
- Fine.

454
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,686
Your mother's told me all about you.

455
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:28,978
- Really?
- Yes.

456
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,898
I'm just sorry your daughter couldn't
join us for dinner. I adore children.

457
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:36,027
Mom, could I talk to you for a minute?

458
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:38,655
- We have company.
- It'll just take a second, really.

459
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:40,698
- But...
- Come on, it'll be fun.

460
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,742
Excuse us. We're gonna have
a spur-of-the-moment conversation.

461
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:47,705
You're pushing me.

462
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:49,164
- Is this a setup?
- What?

463
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:52,459
Connecticut Ken in there.
Is he my invited escort for the evening?

464
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:54,670
- His mother is a friend of mine.
- And?

465
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:56,838
He just moved back here.
He doesn't know anyone.

466
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:58,006
And?

467
00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:00,675
And I thought he might enjoy meeting you.

468
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:02,051
Put that finger down.

469
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:05,721
This is why the Miss Congeniality act
when Rory wanted to beg out of dinner.

470
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:07,640
It seemed like a good opportunity.

471
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:10,685
Mom, thank you for the thought,
but I can get my own men.

472
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:13,228
- Really?
- Yes, really.

473
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:15,356
- I must disagree.
- You must?

474
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,983
Chase is a quality man.
He has good breeding.

475
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:20,903
He comes from a nice family.
He makes a nice living.

476
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:22,946
- He's attractive.
- Mom, no.

477
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,365
Is it gonna kill you
to keep an open mind about him?

478
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:28,076
- He is not my type.
- Why not? Because I like him?

479
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:31,245
I don't know which one,
but there is a game show out there...

480
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:32,830
with your name on it.

481
00:24:32,914 --> 00:24:35,291
That must be it.
You've hardly said two words to him.

482
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,793
You couldn't hate him already.

483
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,795
It's the game where the mole
keeps sticking his head out.

484
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:43,424
You have to pound him with the mallet.
You would be a master at that.

485
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:47,511
Chase may not be as controversial
as your usual brand of men.

486
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:50,431
They'd erect your statue of you
next to it with perfect hair...

487
00:24:50,514 --> 00:24:51,598
pearls and a bronze mallet.

488
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:53,350
I want you to think about something.

489
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:56,520
Tonight, your daughter is celebrating
her three-month anniversary.

490
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:59,939
What was the last relationship you had
that lasted that long?

491
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:02,316
I thought so.

492
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,450
Here we are and very sorry.

493
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:15,162
I had a chance to tell Richard
what I do in the actuarial business.

494
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:16,664
Yes. It's fascinating.

495
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:19,082
Lorelai, may I fix you something to drink?

496
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,709
- Gin.
- And?

497
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:21,835
Gin.

498
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:24,004
Make that two.

499
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:27,257
What about
the one-drink-before-dinner rule?

500
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,759
We have guests. We're celebrating.

501
00:25:30,343 --> 00:25:32,970
Chase, here. Let me help you with that.

502
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:41,270
That was really good.

503
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:42,855
- It was?
- Yes, it was.

504
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:44,523
- How was the salad?
- Great.

505
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:46,650
What about that cheese bread thing?
Too heavy?

506
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:48,235
- Just heavy enough.
- Really?

507
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,071
Everything was perfect.
Even the soda was good.

508
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:52,489
I don't know how they do it...

509
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:55,283
but the Coke here is superior
to the Coke anywhere else.

510
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:58,452
Okay. At what point during that
did you start making fun of me?

511
00:25:58,537 --> 00:25:59,996
I would never make fun of you.

512
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,499
Not after you ordered three kinds of pasta
because I couldn't decide.

513
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:05,043
You shouldn't have to decide.

514
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:07,086
Tonight you should have everything
you want.

515
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:11,132
I just have to say that I am now
a big fan of the three-month anniversary.

516
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:12,508
- Yeah?
- Definitely.

517
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,510
They should have T-shirts and newsletters.

518
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:15,844
I'm glad.

519
00:26:16,137 --> 00:26:17,680
You did all this for me?

520
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:18,930
It's not over yet.

521
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,728
This is just like that Christmas that
I got a full set of illustrated encyclopedias.

522
00:26:25,896 --> 00:26:27,397
I wanted them.

523
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:28,815
Good.

524
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:32,193
One tiramisu, two forks...

525
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:35,696
- and one meatball to go.
- Thank you.

526
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:41,285
- You want to explain the meatball?
- It's a mother-daughter thing.

527
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:45,664
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

528
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:54,256
Okay. Have I mentioned...

529
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,758
how much I'm loving
the three-month anniversary thing?

530
00:26:56,842 --> 00:27:00,178
- Yeah, you did.
- Because this tiramisu is so good...

531
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,348
that if the anniversary were completely
sucking right now, this would save it.

532
00:27:06,851 --> 00:27:08,352
- What?
- Nothing.

533
00:27:08,436 --> 00:27:10,479
- Stop it.
- No, you look cute.

534
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,439
- I'm eating.
- You eat cute.

535
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:14,900
I do not eat cute. No one eats cute.

536
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:16,735
Bambi, maybe, but he's a cartoon.

537
00:27:18,988 --> 00:27:22,866
After we finish here, we move on
to phase two of the anniversary evening.

538
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,952
Phase two. Sounds very official.
Are there spacesuits involved?

539
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:27,912
- With matching helmets.
- Impressive.

540
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:38,798
- Are you a member of the DAR?
- No, I'm not.

541
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,883
D- A-R-N.

542
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:48,307
It's, like, darn, 'cause it's a play on DAR.

543
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,476
Boy, these carrots sure are tiny.

544
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,896
Chase, I'm simply fascinated
about your work situation.

545
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,024
Tell us how you wound up
back here at home.

546
00:27:57,107 --> 00:28:00,193
You move away to make your fortune,
you end up right back here.

547
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:02,362
- Isn't life funny?
- Hilarious.

548
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:03,989
It's a comedy for the masses.

549
00:28:04,072 --> 00:28:06,407
I worked hard
and the company was very good to me.

550
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:09,910
You know a thing or two
about company loyalty, I assume, Richard.

551
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:13,164
The company offered me a choice
of East Coast locations.

552
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:16,083
Sort of a big vote of confidence
in the job I was doing.

553
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,252
Picking your locale.
It's a very coveted position to be in.

554
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:21,922
I would like to be picking
my locale right now.

555
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,007
So I sat down and made my wish list.

556
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:27,636
I looked for places that offered
location amenities as well as job growth.

557
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:30,137
Finally, after days of research...

558
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,307
checking into traffic conditions,
crime rates...

559
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:36,978
the best school systems,
my decision came down to two places.

560
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:39,313
One was in New York
and one was in Hartford.

561
00:28:39,397 --> 00:28:41,440
- And you chose Hartford.
- I did at that.

562
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:45,611
- Is there any more roast?
- Hartford has all the...

563
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:47,947
cosmopolitan, big-city benefits
New York has...

564
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:50,324
without actually having to live
in New York.

565
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:51,867
It just seemed like a no-brainer.

566
00:28:51,951 --> 00:28:54,661
- I'll get Dad some more roast.
- Lee will bring it.

567
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:57,163
But it's so much more personal this way.

568
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:58,373
Hurry back.

569
00:28:58,457 --> 00:29:01,334
I just have to know what the allure
of this Stars Hollow is...

570
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:03,127
I've heard so much about.

571
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,005
Just miles and miles.

572
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,635
- What book did you bring?
- What?

573
00:29:11,678 --> 00:29:14,305
You always bring a book,
and I was just wondering...

574
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:16,891
what's the three-month anniversary book?

575
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:18,517
I brought The New Yorker.

576
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:21,520
- A magazine. Really?
- It's the fiction issue.

577
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:26,649
People of Stars Hollow,
and our many friends.

578
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:31,988
It gives me great pleasure
to preside over...

579
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:35,450
our annual Founders Firelight Festival...

580
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:37,535
for the 32nd time.

581
00:29:40,163 --> 00:29:43,249
Many a true love has had its start...

582
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:46,043
right on the spot where I stand.

583
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,879
And I don't mind telling you...

584
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:53,008
that at this very festival,
right by this gazebo...

585
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:56,219
is where I met my own true love...

586
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,555
Miss Dora Braithwaite.

587
00:29:59,223 --> 00:30:02,476
We have been married for 43 years...

588
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:05,270
and it all started right here.

589
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,981
- Ask her to wave.
- I can't.

590
00:30:09,232 --> 00:30:10,483
Why not?

591
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,152
She went to bingo in Bridgeport.

592
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,488
And now, my friends...

593
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:19,533
if you will join me in lighting the fire.

594
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:21,910
Okay, take me to the surprise now.

595
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:25,247
- But you said you want to see the bonfire.
- I do.

596
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,875
- Mayor Porter said...
- Trust me, it'll take a while before it's lit.

597
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:31,461
We'll have plenty of time
before they're ready.

598
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:33,254
No, I don't have them.

599
00:30:33,338 --> 00:30:36,924
- Every damn year!
- It was Lenny's responsibility!

600
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:40,427
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Does anyone have any matches?

601
00:30:40,512 --> 00:30:41,721
Oh, my God!

602
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:43,639
It's really fascinating stuff.

603
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,808
It sounds it. Tell us more.

604
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:49,520
We're building new statistical models
that let us do a better job...

605
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:51,981
of predicting death
than we've ever been able to do.

606
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:53,440
You might find this interesting.

607
00:30:53,524 --> 00:30:56,651
I've never been one for sitting
at a computer building models.

608
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,611
I'm a client-contact man myself.

609
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:01,907
But these models give you
a better product to sell to those clients.

610
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:03,950
- That does sound interesting.
- It is.

611
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:06,702
If you answer a few simple questions...

612
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:09,539
I could practically pinpoint the day
you're going to die.

613
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:10,623
Goodness.

614
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:13,292
Go ahead. Ask her the questions.

615
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:14,960
I think I'll pass.

616
00:31:15,044 --> 00:31:16,753
No, Lorelai...

617
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:20,049
I'd have to feed the information
into a computer to get the answer.

618
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:21,633
I'm no Kreskin.

619
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:31,059
Why don't you and Lorelai retire
to the living room for some brandy...

620
00:31:31,143 --> 00:31:32,978
while I help Lee to clean up?

621
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,312
While you do what?

622
00:31:34,396 --> 00:31:36,940
That sounds lovely. Shall we?

623
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,819
Sure. I'm just going...

624
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:43,279
to go and powder my something.

625
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:45,948
I'll be back soon.
I'll meet you in the living room.

626
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,991
- I'll be waiting.
- Super.

627
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,766
Lorelai, your mother wants to know if...

628
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:16,852
Hi, Daddy.

629
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,563
I know this is bad.

630
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:23,942
I know this brings back all the horrible
aspects of my childhood life for you.

631
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,737
I'm really sorry that we fought last week.

632
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,530
I'm sorry you're disappointed in me.

633
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,574
I wish there was some way I could fix that.

634
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,576
But there isn't, and I accept that
because I am an adult now...

635
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,037
and I am proud of who I have become.

636
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,832
But I am begging you, please
do not make me go back down there...

637
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,002
because that guy is boring.

638
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,838
Emily, she's not up here!

639
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,883
Thank you, Daddy.

640
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:03,896
- We're here.
- We're where?

641
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:05,357
- Come on.
- What is this?

642
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,235
- Okay, did you ever see Christine?
- Yes.

643
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:10,862
It's nothing like that. Come on.

644
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:18,661
- You brought me to Beirut?
- It's a salvage yard.

645
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:21,121
And yet it looks so much like Beirut.

646
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,584
Okay, here we are.

647
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:28,128
- It's a car.
- It is?

648
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:29,921
- It will be.
- When it grows up?

649
00:33:30,005 --> 00:33:32,257
- When I fix it.
- What?

650
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,010
- It's yours.
- What do you mean it's mine?

651
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:39,263
I'm building it piece by piece for you.

652
00:33:39,514 --> 00:33:42,433
- No.
- Yeah. I started with the frame.

653
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:44,810
The seats and the windshield
went in yesterday.

654
00:33:44,894 --> 00:33:47,229
- You're building me a car?
- It's gonna take a while.

655
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:48,815
But when I'm done, it'll be great.

656
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:52,151
- You're building me a car?
- That's right.

657
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:55,487
I'm building you a car.

658
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:58,156
This is crazy. Why would you do this?

659
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:00,659
I don't know. You didn't have one.

660
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:03,161
You're completely insane.

661
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:05,538
I didn't want you wasting time
on the bus anymore.

662
00:34:05,622 --> 00:34:09,250
That is valuable time we could be
arguing about your ongoing obsession...

663
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:10,918
with very confusing Russian authors.

664
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,796
I can't believe this.

665
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:15,464
Do you like it?

666
00:34:15,548 --> 00:34:17,800
Do I like it? Are you kidding?

667
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:27,017
- I'll take that as a yes.
- Take it, mister.

668
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:28,685
Come on, get in.

669
00:34:31,689 --> 00:34:34,608
- I'll fix that.
- Don't. I like it like that.

670
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:48,412
- This is amazing.
- I'm glad you like it.

671
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:51,874
I had no idea that three months
was the car anniversary.

672
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,501
Four months, you get a plane.

673
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:56,628
Boy, relationships sure have changed
since I was a kid.

674
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:03,844
I'm having
one of those moments right now.

675
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:05,345
What moments?

676
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:09,890
One of those moments when everything
is so perfect and so wonderful...

677
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:14,604
that you almost feel sad because
nothing can ever be this good again.

678
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:19,066
Basically, I'm depressing you?

679
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:20,651
Yup.

680
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:24,488
- You're very weird.
- And you're wonderful.

681
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:42,589
- Rory.
- Yeah?

682
00:35:44,924 --> 00:35:46,300
I love you.

683
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,225
Did you hear me?

684
00:35:57,436 --> 00:35:58,979
Say something.

685
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:05,985
I love the car.

686
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:10,699
- And that's it?
- No, I just...

687
00:36:11,074 --> 00:36:13,659
I'm surprised. I didn't expect...

688
00:36:13,743 --> 00:36:15,202
You don't love me?

689
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:17,413
No, I just have to think about it
for a minute.

690
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:19,165
Think about what?

691
00:36:19,582 --> 00:36:21,959
Saying 'I love you'
is a really difficult thing.

692
00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:24,962
- I just did it.
- And you did it really well.

693
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:26,922
What the hell does that mean?

694
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:29,383
I'm sorry. Please.

695
00:36:29,425 --> 00:36:31,552
This totally came as a surprise.

696
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:35,013
With the dinner and the car
and then the...

697
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:38,725
- I need a minute to think about it.
- This is not something you think about.

698
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:41,144
This is something
that you either feel or you don't.

699
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:42,270
Please don't be mad.

700
00:36:42,354 --> 00:36:46,274
Why? Because I say, 'I love you,'
and you want to think about it?

701
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:50,611
Go home and discuss it with your mother,
make one of your pro-con lists?

702
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:51,945
Not fair.

703
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,615
I'm sorry.

704
00:36:55,783 --> 00:36:58,619
I'm an idiot.
I don't even know what I was thinking.

705
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:03,623
Please. It's just not that easy for me.

706
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:06,126
Saying 'I love you' means a lot.

707
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:10,755
Think about it from my point of view.
My mom and our life.

708
00:37:12,174 --> 00:37:14,467
My mom said that she loved my dad...

709
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:16,761
You don't get pregnant
saying 'I love you. '

710
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:18,054
I know.

711
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:20,556
I'm just confused. I need to...

712
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:24,769
It's a really big deal.

713
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:28,147
- Fine, come on.
- Dean, please don't be mad.

714
00:37:29,148 --> 00:37:30,607
I'll take you home.

715
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,693
Tonight was amazing. It was perfect.

716
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:36,905
- Please, I swear, I just need a minute...
- Whatever.

717
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,241
It doesn't matter, all right? Let's go.

718
00:38:17,986 --> 00:38:20,071
- Sookie.
- Yes, Jackson?

719
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,239
You know what I'm thinking right now?

720
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:25,117
That time I roasted some red peppers
over the stove burner...

721
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,785
and singed off my eyebrows?

722
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:28,203
- No.
- Good.

723
00:38:29,121 --> 00:38:31,790
I'm just thinking, this is really nice.

724
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,792
Me, too.

725
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:54,728
- You getting some good stuff?
- Yeah.

726
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:56,980
The firelight really changes people.

727
00:38:57,064 --> 00:39:00,400
Makes them seem happier, freer,
all the troubles completely gone.

728
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:04,279
I don't think that's the firelight.
I think it's the Founders' Day party punch.

729
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:06,698
Yeah, that stuff is good.

730
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:11,078
At some point, are you gonna tell me
what you're doing here?

731
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:12,912
I'm putting more film in my camera.

732
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:13,996
What?

733
00:39:15,248 --> 00:39:17,792
I told you, I was at the airport,
and now I'm here.

734
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:20,211
Sure, when you put it like that.

735
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:23,923
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you don't sound happy to see me.

736
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:28,010
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you have
a tendency to show up and leave suddenly.

737
00:39:28,094 --> 00:39:30,429
Not one of your more charming attributes.

738
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:32,723
So you're not happy to see me?

739
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:39,103
I don't know what I'm doing here, okay?
I just missed you.

740
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:41,648
I wanted to see you.

741
00:39:42,357 --> 00:39:44,442
I don't know what else to say.

742
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,319
I missed you, too.

743
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,075
Since we're both being blunt...

744
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,827
what's the deal with Lorelai?

745
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:56,912
- What are you talking about?
- Lorelai...

746
00:39:56,954 --> 00:40:00,081
the lady who runs the inn,
and you've told me nothing about.

747
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:04,503
Been very careful to leave out of any story,
anecdote, or gossip about the town.

748
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:07,214
- There is no deal with her. We're friends.
- For now.

749
00:40:07,297 --> 00:40:09,257
- Yes.
- And in the future?

750
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:13,178
She's just...

751
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:16,473
At times, it seems like...

752
00:40:17,224 --> 00:40:18,725
I don't know.

753
00:40:21,102 --> 00:40:23,103
But I am happy to see you.

754
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,356
Good.

755
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:28,609
I'm gonna get some party punch.
You want some?

756
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:30,486
That stuff will kill you.

757
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,613
Some things never change.

758
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:55,801
Where's the fire department
when you need them?

759
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:57,845
Aren't you supposed to be in Hartford?

760
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:59,930
I climbed out the window.

761
00:41:00,514 --> 00:41:03,058
- That's it? You're not curious why?
- No.

762
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:05,018
That's what I love about you.

763
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,353
- How long have you been here?
- A little while.

764
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:09,898
Did you see Taylor and Harry
get into a fistfight?

765
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:14,486
- How did I miss that? I'm so bummed.
- It was good.

766
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:17,822
Where is Rachel?

767
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:20,992
She's a Founders' Party punch junkie.

768
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:23,036
Even the nice girls aren't safe.

769
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,996
She's been running around here,
taking all kinds of pictures.

770
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:29,292
- She's having a good time.
- I guess so. I hope so.

771
00:41:32,712 --> 00:41:35,506
What's the haps with you two?

772
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,799
The haps? Let's see.

773
00:41:37,883 --> 00:41:39,884
What is the haps?

774
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:43,304
- I mean, like...
- I know what you meant by 'the haps. '

775
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:46,224
- You're repeating it a thousand times.
- I was pondering.

776
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:49,394
- You ponder so slowly.
- Lf I did it fast, it wouldn't be pondering.

777
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:51,812
Pondering by nature
has a slow connotation.

778
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:53,272
Okay, fine.

779
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:57,526
- Is she staying?
- I don't know.

780
00:41:58,653 --> 00:42:01,071
- Do you want her to?
- I don't know.

781
00:42:02,198 --> 00:42:04,575
- She seems to really like you.
- Yeah, she does.

782
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:07,285
But she doesn't have
the greatest attention span.

783
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:09,579
- But she is here.
- Yes, she is.

784
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,000
You spend a lot of time debating things.
Is it right, is it wrong?

785
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:16,044
Should I do this, should I do that?

786
00:42:16,128 --> 00:42:18,630
Sometimes you should just jump in,
and take a shot.

787
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:21,840
What's the worst that can happen?
She left before. I lived.

788
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:24,343
Maybe this time...

789
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:27,846
- I think that's really great.
- You do?

790
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:30,891
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

791
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:38,607
- I guess I'm gonna go check up on Rachel.
- That's nice.

792
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:39,775
What?

793
00:42:39,942 --> 00:42:43,236
That you have somebody
you can go check up on. That's nice.

794
00:42:43,278 --> 00:42:46,447
Yeah, it is, unless she's completely drunk
and throwing up.

795
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:47,782
Still nice.

796
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,412
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

797
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,149
Hi. You've reached Max Medina.

798
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,444
I'm not here now.
Leave a message at the beep...

799
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:28,946
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.

800
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,826
We just broke up.
