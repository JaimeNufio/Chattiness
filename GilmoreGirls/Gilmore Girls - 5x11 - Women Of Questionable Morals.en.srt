1
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:07,736
- Hey. Wake up.
- Huh?

2
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:09,708
- Wake up.
- No.

3
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:13,312
- Come on, you're missing it.
- Is "it" sleep? 'Cause you'd be right.

4
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:16,056
- Smell the air. Smell it.
- It smells cold.

5
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:18,364
- Come on.
- What? No, it's freezing.

6
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:19,332
Come on!

7
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:24,410
- The floor's cold.
- Geez, you're so obsessed with the cold.

8
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:26,454
- Because it's cold!
- I know.

9
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,938
- I'm turning numb.
- Keep moving.

10
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:35,840
Are my feet still attached to my body or did they snap off coming down the stairs?

11
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,442
- They're still there.
- Why are we out here?

12
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,923
- Take a deep breath.
- What?

13
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:40,947
- Do it.
- Yeah.

14
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:44,805
- Oh, yeah. I smell snow.
- What?

15
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:47,661
It's coming. I always know. I can smell it, and I'm never wrong.

16
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:49,019
It wasn't in the forecast.

17
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:53,964
It's just my favorite time of the year. The whole world changes color.

18
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,367
I think I'm blacking out.

19
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:58,987
Flakes, flurries, swirls, crystals, whatever form it comes in.

20
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:02,235
I'll take it. We go back, snow and me. We have a beautiful history.

21
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:06,018
Saw two forecasts, there was no mention of snow. Cold, but no snow.

22
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:10,717
Sleigh rides, ice skating, snowball fights. I'll even take curling. God, I love curling!

23
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:12,929
Lance Cranston on Channel 6 said it would be dry.

24
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:15,499
Kimmy Liston, Live at 5, same thing. No snow, nothing.

25
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,513
Hot cocoa, hot toddies. Best time of the year!

26
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:23,825
Jimmy Mountain in Accu-Chopper One said it would be weeks before...

27
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:32,830
Lance and Kimmy are idiots.

28
00:02:33,606 --> 00:02:34,849
Welcome, friend.

29
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,450
- I'm going inside now.
- But...

30
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:39,488
- One more whiff, and then so are you.
- Luke...

31
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:41,966
- Streetwalker.
- Too urban.

32
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,539
- Concubine.
- Seems high-falutin.

33
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:47,332
Anyone seen Farewell My Concubine? Beautiful film. Gorgeous cinematography.

34
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:49,667
I'm surprised you see such adult fare, Reverend.

35
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:52,760
Well, do you picture me watching Sound of Music every night, Taylor? Gag me.

36
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:54,680
- Scarlet woman.
- I like it.

37
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,205
- Too Nathaniel Hawthorne.
- Who?

38
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:57,577
- Read a book.
- Harlot.

39
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,666
- Naw.
- Woman of accomadating morals.

40
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:01,033
- Too long.
- Hot mutton.

41
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,189
- I wouldn't know where to begin.
- What are you guys doing?

42
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,993
Well, the first snow has come along, Luke, and with the first snow

43
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,457
comes the town's Revolutionary War Re-enactment.

44
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,290
Always a heel-clicking good time.

45
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:12,662
Oh, well, we've got a big surprise for everybody this year.

46
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:15,114
- Great, I'll pretend I'm interested.
- It's a big deal, Luke.

47
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:17,156
Yeah, it's the same thing every year, Reverend.

48
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:21,079
You guys re-enact the time a bunch of pig-headed morons stood outside all night

49
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,977
in the freezing snow waiting for a battle that never happened.

50
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:25,232
This year is different, crank.

51
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:30,603
A local historian uncovered new evidence of Star's Hollow's participation in the Revolution.

52
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:33,803
Apparently, an English battalion was awaiting the return

53
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:37,284
of their commanding general with plans for a big battle.

54
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,474
Our soldiers caught wind of this and blocked the high road

55
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,724
so that the general had to travel by the lower road, through town, to reach his troops.

56
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:45,947
So, they kidnapped him.

57
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:49,773
No, they were much slyer than that.

58
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,649
They had a brave lady of the town use her wiles

59
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:56,715
to draw the general to her rooms and keep him occupied.

60
00:04:56,786 --> 00:05:00,426
That delayed the general's arrival which allowed Lafayette

61
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,586
the opportunity to ambush the waiting British troops.

62
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:05,286
A hooker stopped a battle.

63
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,729
- We're not calling her a hooker.
- It's too "Baretta".

64
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:10,595
That's what we're doing now, trying to figure out what the hell to call her.

65
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,316
- Bit of stuff.
- Too Monty Python.

66
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:15,823
This new re-enactment is going to be a huge boost to tourism, Luke.

67
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:17,809
The local press is all excited to cover it.

68
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,212
Well then they're very easily amused.

69
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:23,844
Got a big casting session soon to pick the lucky townswoman to play our special lady.

70
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,986
- She should be thin.
- But not too thin.

71
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,363
Know anybody who fits the bill?

72
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,688
Not off-hand, but if I run into any moderately-weighted whores in my travels, I'll let you know.

73
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:34,230
Well, Patty is ready to go...

74
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:35,780
- Morning.
- Good morning again.

75
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:39,370
Oh, cool, the re-enactors are meeting. Another wonderful by-product of snow.

76
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,683
Oh, yes, they're cooking up something very special. You want coffee?

77
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,782
No. I'm late, so I'll just grab it at the inn.

78
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:48,324
I'm actually looking forward to having my first cup of joe in my new, snow covered inn

79
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,746
and - why are the re-enactors staring at me?

80
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,437
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

81
00:05:52,588 --> 00:05:55,058
The Reverend is blushing. Why is he blushing?

82
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:59,144
I'd walk out of here is I was you. And try not to walk too sexy.

83
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:00,716
Okay. You'll explain that to me later?

84
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:02,180
- I'd enjoy that.
- Okay.

85
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,079
- Hi, guys.
- Pretty lady.

86
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:05,564
Too thin.

87
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,980
This is not about your taste, Andrew.

88
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,701
I'm going for historical accuracy's side. Women were heavier back then.

89
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:13,926
How about your wife?

90
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,349
You want a sock in the nose?

91
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,298
No, no, Jean, that works perfectly with my schedule.

92
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,357
It’s been forever since we’ve seen each other.

93
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:25,476
Oh, I’d love that! Mirabelle is still one of my favorite – oh!

94
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,703
Oh my God! Oh my God!

95
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:31,252
No, Jean, hang on a second, will you?

96
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:37,585
- Hello?
- There’s a dog on the patio!

97
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,874
- What? Emily?
- Of course it’s Emily!

98
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:42,399
- I’m sorry. You sound agitated.
- Did you get a dog?

99
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,912
- Certainly not!
- Well, there’s a dog on the patio.

100
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:47,512
- Well, where are you?
- Inside! Richard, do something!

101
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:48,880
I can’t see it from here.

102
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,787
Well, he’s here nonetheless, and he’s looking at me! Richard, the dog is looking at me!

103
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:56,323
- Hold on.
- I’m holding, but what are we going to – Richard?

104
00:06:57,815 --> 00:06:59,575
Shoo! Shoo!

105
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:01,491
Now do you believe me?

106
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:03,904
Well, I wasn’t doubting you, Emily, I just couldn’t see it.

107
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:04,855
What is that?

108
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:08,004
Oh, you made it sound like it was a rabid beast, so I came prepared.

109
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,252
Don’t get too close.

110
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,003
I don’t see any froth on his mouth.

111
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:12,017
Well, that’s something.

112
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:15,002
I see a collar but no tags. That isn’t very smart.

113
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,385
You’re getting too close.

114
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:20,010
Well, what should I do? It’s freezing out here. We can’t let it roam around.

115
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:21,663
Well it can’t come into the house.

116
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,055
Why someone would fail to put a tag on a dog...

117
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:25,232
Take it to the pool house.

118
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,320
- What? Why?
- Well, that’s why we have it.

119
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:29,404
We have a pool house for stray dogs?

120
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:33,327
Love the innuendo, Emily. Fine. I will take him into the pool house.

121
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:36,692
Thank you, Richard. I came out and he was just sitting there.

122
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:38,554
- It’s a he?
- I don’t know.

123
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,530
Well, I can’t get a visual from this angle.

124
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:41,606
It’s not important.

125
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:43,864
Dog! I want you to come with me.

126
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:45,543
Come along, dog!

127
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,106
He’s following you.

128
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:48,436
Seems to be working!

129
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:50,066
Good job, Richard!

130
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:55,313
Hey! You know who just nipped at my nose? Jack Frost.

131
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:57,876
Huh. You know who just nipped at my ear? Jack I-Don’t-Care.

132
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,103
Look outside, Michel. It’s the first time we’ve seen the Inn blanketed by snow.

133
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,700
- It’s like a postcard.
- I know.

134
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:06,710
I haven’t been this excited since Madonna just dropped by Total Request Live.

135
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,482
The floor’s a little wet, are we getting the mats out?

136
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,695
We are without mats.

137
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:11,905
That’s impossible, we ordered them eight months ago. We got confirmation.

138
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:15,020
They were back-ordered and due within two weeks. Two weeks turned into eight months,

139
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:18,742
and all we have to show for it is our special yellow back-order receipt.

140
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,425
Such cheap paper they use at the mat place. That should have been a clue.

141
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:22,485
What else can we put down?

142
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:25,731
Oh, plenty. I saw two movies over the weekend. They were both awful.

143
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:29,273
No, I meant put down on the floor so our guests don’t slip and fall. We have to find something.

144
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,752
The good news is that there will be less people here who could possibly slip.

145
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,803
What do you mean, less people?

146
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:36,477
We’ve had four cancellations in the last hour.

147
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:39,376
- Why? What happened?
- All due to snow.

148
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,587
Snow? Our beautiful snow?

149
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:44,039
People say it is cold, the streets are bad...

150
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,210
The streets are fine. They’re plowing away out there.

151
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:50,537
A graceful, gorgeous plow was pushing the snowy white out of the street right behind me, it was beautiful.

152
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,677
- They wanted nice weather.
- This is nice weather.

153
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,504
It’s classic Connecticut inn weather. It’s all the more reason to come.

154
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,905
I would advise that you change our cancellation policy.

155
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:00,208
These people cancel and have to pay nothing.

156
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:03,598
I hate charging people for canceling. It’s too corporate. We’re doing things differently here.

157
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:06,706
Oh, yes. Bankruptcy will be fun and different.

158
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:08,861
Be sure to file for it while it’s snowing, won’t you?

159
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,816
We’ll go down to bankruptcy court in a horse-drawn sleigh.

160
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:13,352
Try to find mats.

161
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:14,662
I’ll do what I can.

162
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:16,507
Hey, Sookie.

163
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:17,510
Good morning.

164
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,736
How are you loving our winter wonderland?

165
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:22,282
- My car wouldn’t start this morning.
- Oh, drag.

166
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,176
And we’re almost completely out of coffee.

167
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,764
Oh, well. So, make some more.

168
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:28,164
I mean out, out. There’s no more on the premises.

169
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,572
- You’re kidding.
- I wish I was.

170
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,595
But there’s mounds of it stacked in the walk-in.

171
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:34,242
Heroin-sniffing dogs get all excited and confused when they go in there.

172
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,091
Why do they get all excited and confused?

173
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:37,652
Because you smuggle heroin in coffee.

174
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:38,963
No, I don’t!

175
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,173
It was in Beverly Hills Cop, remember? The heroin in the coffee?

176
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:43,745
Why are you taking everything so literally?

177
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:44,936
My car wouldn’t start!

178
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,827
Since when does that make you take things literally?

179
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,265
Wait, I’m sorry, when were there dogs in the walk-in?

180
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,187
I’m just saying, we had a lot of coffee. Until now, apparently.

181
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:55,276
‘Cause we’re switching suppliers. I found that new blend, you remember?

182
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:57,866
- You tasted it, you said it tasted great.
- I liked it. I remember.

183
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:00,272
So I’m letting the old stuff run out because the new stuff’s coming in

184
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,576
but the new stuff is back-ordered, so it never came in.

185
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:04,071
Well, send out for more, immediately.

186
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:05,525
- Not possible.
- Why?

187
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:10,082
Remember those wonderful snowplows you were writing a sonnet to not five minutes ago?

188
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:14,783
Well, one of them dumped a ten-foot mountain of snow in our driveway.

189
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,635
- There is no getting in or out.
- Unbelievable.

190
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:22,288
Well, it’s not so bad, because with the cancellations, no one’s coming today anyway.

191
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,469
Yes, but we have to get out, to go home, eventually, and to get coffee now.

192
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:26,799
So start the guys digging.

193
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:29,354
You mean I should get the one guy who did not call in sick

194
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:31,377
because of the snow and the cold to get digging?

195
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:32,451
Yes, get him digging!

196
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,951
It’s okay, it’s all good.

197
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:40,424
Snow will be dug and mats will be found, coffee will be bought, everything’s good.

198
00:10:40,604 --> 00:10:41,351
By the way.

199
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:44,152
- Yeah.
- There are some people out there eating breakfast, and...

200
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:47,166
- And...
- And they’re drinking coffee.

201
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:48,948
Customers.

202
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:52,994
- Good morning.
- Stupid C-span.

203
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:54,019
W hat?

204
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:56,435
Stupid C-span’s had me on hold forever and I’ve got to get going.

205
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,359
Well, you’re not the only one who calls C-span, Paris.

206
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,412
Right. There are a lot of us. Like the guy who asked the question

207
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:02,928
about Iran’s long-range missile production and nuclear capacity,

208
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:04,396
then shouted Ba Ba Booie!

209
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,854
Him they put on. Me they’ve got twiddling my thumbs.

210
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,014
- Dad.
- Hey, kiddo.

211
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:10,842
What are you doing here?

212
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:12,757
Aw, I was just in the neighborhood, I thought I’d look you up.

213
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,786
Did you bring the baby?

214
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,962
Baby’s getting spoiled by her grandma. So where are you headed?

215
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:17,079
I have class.

216
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:21,067
Right. College. Classes. I’ve seen Oxford Blues, I should have put that together.

217
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,383
So this is your place, huh?

218
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:25,747
Yeah. It’s a little messy right now. That’s Paris.

219
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:27,421
- We’ve met. Hi, Paris.
- Hello.

220
00:11:27,558 --> 00:11:30,432
Yeah, I’ve got a suggestion for getting you guys out of the ratings basement.

221
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:32,393
And putting me on hold is not one of them.

222
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:33,934
So, you were just passing through?

223
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:38,285
Yeah, I was in the area, or the area near the area, so how about breakfast?

224
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:41,103
- Oh, I don’t have time.
- It’s the most important meal of the day.

225
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:43,461
And the most skipped around here. Mornings are busy.

226
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:46,234
Forget busy. Forget class. Play hooky, have breakfast with me.

227
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:48,676
Come on. We can all go together if you want. Paris?

228
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,840
I am kind of hungry. And C-span can kiss my ass.

229
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,336
- Okay, then, we’re on.
- Dad...

230
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:56,824
- We can walk, we can drive, whatever...
- Dad, no! I have to go. I can’t be any clearer, okay?

231
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,084
Rory...

232
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:06,387
Well, we can certainly rebook you, because we’d love to have you come anytime. Really.

233
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:10,308
But if you reconsidered your cancellation and came in now you would find nothing less

234
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:14,759
than a magical wonderland. A snowy xanadu of goodness. Really.

235
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,853
Bing Crosby’s warming up his pipes over by the fireplace. Magical.

236
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:22,401
Yes, driving in the snow is tricky.

237
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:26,886
No, I don’t think I could get Bing Crosby to come pick you up.

238
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:31,487
Okay. Well, just check your calendar and call me back, and I’ll be here to rearrange it.

239
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:33,291
Thank you. Bye.

240
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,035
That was very graceful.

241
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:40,608
Oh, I’m desperate for those mats.

242
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:44,309
I had been working on the mats but you asked me to shovel the snow.

243
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:47,733
And now I have a blister, a muscle spasm and a neck crick

244
00:12:47,806 --> 00:12:50,544
and I have a date tonight, and a crick will cramp my kissing move.

245
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,000
Well, I appreciate your effort.

246
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,862
Are you being sarcastic?

247
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:55,132
Just a tiny bit.

248
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:59,059
You know that I am light-boned and cannot take physical exertion.

249
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,861
I work with my mind.

250
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:04,057
Well, you’re excused from shoveling duty, just focus on the mats.

251
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,534
We have another problem. The Goldfarbs are missing.

252
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:07,947
The Goldfarbs? Our Goldfarbs?

253
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,922
The ones you recommended to go cross-country skiing this morning.

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,193
Right. So they’re out skiing.

255
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,231
They said they would be back by noon promptly.

256
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:17,240
Well, it’s past noon, and their friends are here to meet them for lunch,

257
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,105
but the Goldfarbs are erwol.

258
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:20,728
- They’re what?
- Erwol! Erwol!

259
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:23,124
- Oh! Awol.
- What do I care. I’m French.

260
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:26,487
The point is, we strapped wooden sticks to the feet of a fat orthodontist

261
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,358
and a woman with ugly chunky jewelry, and we lost them.

262
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:32,160
- Oh my God, it’s only noon!
- Can I call the authorities?

263
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:33,424
You think we’re there already?

264
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:34,914
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

265
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:38,371
No, let’s wait another twenty minutes, just keep calling their cell phone.

266
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:40,148
Oh, joy.

267
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,263
Please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing.

268
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:44,684
What? I’m just cleaning up. We’re short-handed today. Go about your business.

269
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:47,903
You were pouring leftover coffee from other people’s cups into your own cup

270
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:50,193
- and now you’re going to drink it!
- No, no, no!

271
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,801
- Give me that cup!
- No! Get away!

272
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:54,950
Don’t you understand if I don’t get coffee in me, things are going to get ugly around here!

273
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:57,233
- Going to get?
- Be very careful! She’s near a knife!

274
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,932
- Give me that. I’m ashamed of you.
- I’m ashamed of me too.

275
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,127
If that wasn’t a cry for help, huh.

276
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:03,889
- I’m going out.
- The driveway’s still blocked.

277
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,327
- On foot.
- The snow is soft and four feet deep.

278
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:09,793
- I’m cross-country skiing for coffee.
- The Goldfarbs have the skis!

279
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,744
I’m going out and I’m bringing back coffee!

280
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,459
Be careful of the floor!

281
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:16,464
Oh! Oh, I’m sorry. We’re getting mats, I swear.

282
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:17,872
Have a nice day.

283
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:22,694
Emily. Hello.

284
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:26,059
Hello. I saw your car in the driveway and was just wondering if everything was okay.

285
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,381
Everything’s fine. Thank you.

286
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,391
I’ve put off my morning appointments to sort of stabilize the canine situation.

287
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:35,203
She’s been fairly calm.

288
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:38,347
- Oh, it’s a she?
- That has been ascertained.

289
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:41,577
- And there’s no I.D. tag?
- A gross oversight of its owners.

290
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,476
I found its exact breed, though, which may come in handy.

291
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:45,587
Oh, wonderful!

292
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,275
Let me bring up the website.

293
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:52,633
Dog Breed 411 dot com”..

294
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:56,815
Isn’t that clever? It’s amazing the information available on the computer these days.

295
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:59,339
Oh, it’s wonderful. There are websites you’d be interested in, too.

296
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:00,439
Oh, I wouldn’t know how.

297
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:02,770
Oh, it’s easy. Whatever you’re interested in, you just type it in -

298
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:06,840
the DAR, or Louis Vuitton, Franz Schubert - and you’re off and running.

299
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,352
- That easy?
- That easy.

300
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:11,372
- There she is!
- A long-haired Jack Russell terrier.

301
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:15,114
I’ll start calling the neighbors and tell them we have a long-haired Jack Russell terrier.

302
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:16,159
A female.

303
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:17,536
What’s all that luggage?

304
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:19,394
Ah, that is the Louis Vuitton website.

305
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:21,510
I thought you might like to peruse it.

306
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,517
Isn’t that something?

307
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,184
You use that mouse there to move around.

308
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,560
A mouse? How fun!

309
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:32,946
That was David Hume. A personal favorite,

310
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,599
and I’m not saying that because Hume was Scottish and my mother’s maiden name is McCammon.

311
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:41,882
Okay, more on the principles of morals, and perhaps why Scots rule, next time we’re together.

312
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:42,864
Have a good day.

313
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,047
And read!

314
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:45,764
Read!

315
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:49,941
- Still here?
- Still here.

316
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,588
This is for you. Coffee. It might be a little cold.

317
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,261
Teachers sure talk a lot here at Yale.

318
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,855
- No bells. Don’t they have bells?
- Nope. Thanks for this.

319
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,868
You’re welcome.

320
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:04,564
Look, Rory, that manic, desperate guy that came down to your dorm room this morning,

321
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:08,071
he left, he’s gone, and I’m not going to bug you anymore, okay?

322
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,002
Okay.

323
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:12,412
I didn’t think it through, and I feel pretty dumb coming down here like this.

324
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:18,153
I just have to say, though, that I hate our relationship, okay? I hate it.

325
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,938
This wall, this stupid wall, it sucks.

326
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:24,327
And I put it there, but I wanted to try and do something about it, but I got a little desperate,

327
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:26,273
- and I’m sorry.
- It’s okay.

328
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:29,959
I’ve been in Hartford a lot. My dad’s sick. My mom’s with the baby

329
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:33,829
and I’ve had time to think, and maybe that’s not good, but...

330
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:36,983
my dad and I, we always had that wall, you know? And...

331
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:40,507
God, for us to be that way, like my dad and me? I...

332
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:44,996
I don’t want you visiting me when I’m old and cranky and you feel like you have to.

333
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,613
I want you to visit now and I want you to want to.

334
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:49,773
Look, I’m not going to bother you anymore.

335
00:16:50,397 --> 00:16:53,429
This wasn’t fair for me to do this, surprising you like this.

336
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:56,286
It wasn’t fair. Uh...

337
00:16:56,763 --> 00:16:59,952
Here. I didn’t know how you take your coffee so I got you everything.

338
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:02,814
I’ll see you, kid.

339
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:05,313
Bye.

340
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:10,751
This is not just an historic re-enactment, ladies.

341
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,848
This is an historic moment unto itself.

342
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:17,812
This will be the first time that a member of our fairer sex

343
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:23,095
has participated in Stars Hollow’s Revolutionary War Re-enactment.

344
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:26,475
Lulu is fully aware of the historical significance of this, Taylor.

345
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,782
She’s bright and sexy, I’ll tell you that now.

346
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:37,338
All right. My point is that this will be the first vital role a woman has played in our re-enactment.

347
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:40,478
And you should know that it is of a sensitive nature,

348
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:43,319
so if you’re overly sensitive you may want to back out now.

349
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,501
Lulu’s as insensitive as they come, Taylor.

350
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,133
Fine, Kirk. Thank you.

351
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,574
Now we’ve little time and we have to choose the right girl quickly.

352
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,320
Stand up, please, all of you.

353
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:58,157
All right. Based on the visual that we’re looking for

354
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:02,980
I must now eliminate numbers two, five, seven and nine.

355
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,439
Thank you for coming.

356
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:11,090
Now, for the rest of you, I need to see a demonstration of your acting abilities.

357
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:13,722
Please give me your best come hither” look.

358
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,948
Your… come hither” looks, ladies?

359
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,664
That was my come hither” look.

360
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,765
Girls, girls! You’re supposed to be seducing a man.

361
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:36,618
Now picture, on horseback, a dashing, finely accoutered gentleman, firm of jaw and solid of build...

362
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,339
I thought you were doing it, Taylor.

363
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:42,737
I am – oh! You with your funny jokes.

364
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,606
Yes. Me and my jokes.

365
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,052
- Four and eight, you may go.
- Yes!

366
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:51,477
- Taylor, isn’t eight your sister’s kid?
- Mm-hmm. Yes, little Debbie.

367
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:55,562
And you were coaching her to – I mean, you had her – never mind.

368
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,743
Let’s try the look again, girls. You’re being seductive.

369
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,594
Oh, Kirk, don’t be a pageant mom.

370
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:11,819
I can’t tell in these outfits. You’re all so heavily dressed.

371
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:13,176
It’s cold outside.

372
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:16,417
The young heroine of our story didn’t think of the cold

373
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,616
when she gave up her greatest treasure for her country.

374
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:23,170
Lulu’s got a bunch of hot outfits, Taylor. I can put her in something.

375
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,355
Not necessary. Number one?

376
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:28,545
Thank you for coming.

377
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:31,266
Rats.

378
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:37,881
- Oh! Lorelai!
- Hey, Taylor.

379
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:39,790
How would you like to play our woman of easy virtue?

380
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:42,401
- What?
- This is a straight offer, no audition necessary.

381
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:46,328
Oh, well, it’s the best offer I’ve gotten all day, Taylor, but unfortunately I’d have to – ah! Ah!

382
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,962
Is that a yes or a no?

383
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:49,180
It’s a no, thank you.

384
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:53,450
The level of commitment in this town is stunningly low.

385
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:56,486
All right, girls, let’s see your sexy walk.

386
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,552
Warmth!

387
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:04,950
- What are you doing?
- The icicle foot.

388
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:07,448
It’s the latest dance craze, all the hip kids are doing it.

389
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:08,552
Your shoe’s all wet.

390
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:12,195
Oh, this evil puddle was lying in wait. Evil, evil!

391
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:15,407
- Let me get you a towel.
- Oh, forget the foot. I need caffeine.

392
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,434
Whatever form you’ve got, I haven’t had any all day.

393
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:20,542
I’ll drink it, shoot it, eat it, snort it, whatever form it’s in, gimme.

394
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:22,416
Should I bother to ask how your day’s going?

395
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:26,312
Oh, terrif! My shoe’s an icicle, the Inn’s driveway is snowed in and we lost the Goldfarbs.

396
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:27,183
Who are the Goldfarbs?

397
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:29,840
The two guests who bothered to show up. I sent them skiing and I killed them.

398
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,940
- You killed your guests?
- Eh, well, you know what happens.

399
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:32,887
Here.

400
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:36,343
The only bright side of my day is being asked to be a prostitute.

401
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,657
That’s something to cling to.

402
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:40,273
Oh, hot! Warn me!

403
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,148
Coffee’s hot? Sorry. Coffee’s hot.

404
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:47,013
My girlfriend’s the whore! My girlfriend’s the whore! Woohoo! Yeah!

405
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:50,822
Great, now I’m not even the town whore.

406
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,336
Well, if you like, I’ll leave a little something on the dresser for you tonight.

407
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:55,439
- It couldn’t hurt.
- Here. Ice cube.

408
00:20:57,545 --> 00:21:00,663
Well, it would help to just put the word out there that we have a dog.

409
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:03,099
In case anyone hears of anyone looking for one.

410
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:07,073
That’s right. A white long-haired Jack Russell terrier.

411
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,406
Thank you, Margaret. I’ll be here all day. Bye.

412
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:11,878
Margaret. Whitson?

413
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:15,414
I figured a call to the neighborhood busybody was the first order of business.

414
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:16,407
How’s it doing?

415
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:21,354
Well, it seems to be asleep now, but I am lacking a proper bowl for its food.

416
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:23,283
I think I can help you with that, follow me.

417
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:26,422
What are you feeding it?

418
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:29,832
I’ve got some leftover stew. I’m going to pick chunks of meat out of it.

419
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:33,855
Stew? Richard, tell me that that man of yours isn’t feeding you stew?

420
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:38,607
Well, he probably offered. He said it was a recipe passed down by some dead relative.

421
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,623
Stew? That may be what killed his relative.

422
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:42,760
I didn’t think of it.

423
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:45,714
Promise me you’ll make him prepare proper food for you. Please.

424
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,746
- That’s what he’s paid for.
- I promise, Emily.

425
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:50,286
- Here we go.
- Ah, looks perfect.

426
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:52,856
And it’s chipped, so just toss it when you’re done.

427
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:54,418
- Thank you, Emily.
- You’re welcome.

428
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,121
- And the stew is history.
- Good.

429
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:04,980
From what I can gather, this woman made eyes at a British general,

430
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:08,068
and the British general was feeling a little randy.

431
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:10,105
Such a salacious history our town has.

432
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:12,814
And she led him into her house and kept the fellow occupied.

433
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:14,238
Occupied his brains out, huh?

434
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,035
- Hey, don’t warp the loo.
- Sorry.

435
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,053
But why do you think they didn’t just kill him?

436
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,248
I don’t know, maybe they knew that we would ultimately make peace with England

437
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,514
and they wouldn’t want to kill a potential great-great-grandfather

438
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,726
of a Winston Churchill or a Benny Hill.

439
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,435
Well, that was very forward-thinking of them.

440
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:31,343
Boy, do I know how to dress a slut or what? I am very proud.

441
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:33,274
So you haven’t said anything about our first snow.

442
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,496
- That’s right, I haven’t.
- Why? You don’t sound so excited.

443
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:37,867
- Snow and I had a bit of a bumpy ride today.
- Bummer.

444
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:40,392
I blame myself. I may have been too needy with snow. Too clingy.

445
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:42,737
So it had no choice but to push me away, create a boundary.

446
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:44,098
Snow and men have a lot in common.

447
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,150
What about you? Anything exciting happen today?

448
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:48,518
You get in a snowball fight with a Nobel Prize winner or something?

449
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,245
No, no. Nothing out of the ordinary.

450
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:55,311
But I’m sorry that snow was so mean to you today.

451
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:58,183
Oh, it’s okay. It wasn’t snow’s fault.

452
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:01,629
We had one bad day. Every relationship has its bad days.

453
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:04,399
It doesn’t mean you drop and run, you keep going, right?

454
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:07,472
Peaks and valleys keep a relationship fresh.

455
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:08,202
I agree.

456
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,935
Tomorrow is another day.

457
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:24,194
No.

458
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:34,889
Don’t do that.

459
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:37,737
- I want it gone, gone!
- I’m getting it gone.

460
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,320
But this is personal. I’m physically hurting the snow as I dig at it.

461
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:45,585
I’m chopping into its stupid white face with my razor sharp fingernail claws

462
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:47,448
and I’m delighting in it! I want it to suffer!

463
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,627
You look deranged.

464
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,829
Take that. Argh, and that!

465
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:52,246
Why did you park it under a tree?

466
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:55,298
I have been parking this stupid car under this stupid tree forever!

467
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:56,613
- But it’s snowing.
- Yes!

468
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,105
But snow has always protected me before. It’s been a white blanket of love!

469
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:01,898
We had a symbiotic thing going on!

470
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:03,475
Snow cannot protect you.

471
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,937
Snow is frozen water falling out of the sky.

472
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,963
And as for this car and this tree, you can predict it. It’s gravity.

473
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:11,380
There’s four tons of snow on this tree.

474
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,646
You park under it, gravity is going to come into play and take it out! It’s basic physics!

475
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:17,686
I do not need a physics lesson right now, no matter how well it’s intentioned!

476
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:22,494
- Sorry.
- It’s over. Oh, yes, it is over!

477
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:24,047
- What is?
- Me and snow.

478
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,937
- We’re through!
- No, you’re not!

479
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:29,684
It was years of bliss, you know? We had some good stuff, and good times.

480
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,759
I could show you pictures of the snow angels I made. But I am done. Done!

481
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,234
Well, let it down easy, okay?

482
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:38,602
Oh! And I am changing my cancellation policy at the Inn.

483
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,057
- Because of snow?
- Yes.

484
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:44,005
From now on if anyone cancels for any reason that I don’t agree with

485
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:47,357
within two years of the date in question, no, no! Make it three!

486
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:51,777
Then, I am not going to refund their money and I’m going to kick them in the groin!

487
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,492
- Geez.
- But with my left foot.

488
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:57,927
Because my right foot is still throbbing from being frozen in icy cold water

489
00:24:57,987 --> 00:25:00,533
which has effectively ended my foot modeling career!

490
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,580
Foot modeling is a dying art anyway.

491
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:04,306
I am with you now, buddy, a hundred percent.

492
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,105
With me on what?

493
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:11,351
Snow is nothing but annoying icy frozen water stuff that falls out of the sky at inconvenient times.

494
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:14,721
It’s Mother Nature’s icy Screw you, Lorelai Gilmore”..

495
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:18,411
It’s just stupid stuff you have to shovel out of the way so customers can get into the Inn.

496
00:25:18,493 --> 00:25:21,294
It’s the stuff that melts and leaks through your roof!

497
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,111
It’s the stuff that stalls your car, it’s the stuff that buries your car...

498
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:27,980
Oh no! No! Don’t even try to make up with me now! You and me are through!

499
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:30,695
You stupid – hate – you!

500
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:36,076
- Hello, Robert.
- Good evening, ladies.

501
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:37,351
- Hello, girls.
- Hey, grandpa.

502
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:38,882
- Hi, Dad.
- Did you come together tonight?

503
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:40,852
Oh, no, just a lucky coincidence.

504
00:25:42,434 --> 00:25:44,089
Well, hello, Mom.

505
00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:46,044
- Hello, girls.
- Hi, Grandma.

506
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,743
Just go about your drinks. I’m just here to sit with the dog.

507
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:50,484
- Dog?
- Oh, he’s cute!

508
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,717
- When did you get a dog?
- She’s not our dog.

509
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,909
- No less confused.
- And, it’s a he.

510
00:25:55,215 --> 00:25:57,017
- The dog?
- The dog is a boy.

511
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:58,271
I thought you said it was a girl.

512
00:25:58,353 --> 00:26:02,018
I got another peek. It was rolling around on its back and it was painfully obvious.

513
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:04,073
- They’re so hairy down there.
- This one especially.

514
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:05,809
It’s going from weird to weirder.

515
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:08,399
- The usual beverage for everybody?
- So he’s not your dog?

516
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,621
It just showed up in our yard yesterday morning.

517
00:26:10,714 --> 00:26:14,139
We have no idea how it got here or where it came from. It has no tags.

518
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,788
He’s a very big mystery, this dog.

519
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,434
Oh, now I’m monopolizing things and I’m not even here.

520
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:20,282
Please, go about your drinks.

521
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,812
No, no, I’m having Robert make one up for you as well.

522
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,819
Are you sure? Because I’m not officially here.

523
00:26:24,912 --> 00:26:25,736
Absolutely.

524
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:27,726
Thank you, Richard.

525
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,159
So how long are you going to keep him?

526
00:26:30,252 --> 00:26:31,618
As long as it takes to find the owners.

527
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:33,616
Richard had to miss a half day of work yesterday.

528
00:26:33,703 --> 00:26:38,090
But Emily has agreed to write a note excusing my absence, so it should be okay.

529
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,452
Okay, now pretend I’m not here. You girls and I can chat later.

530
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:43,334
Okay.

531
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:49,037
Well, Rory, oh my God, did I tell you about the horrendous thing that Mom did?

532
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:51,171
She can be such a witch with a ‘B’.

533
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:52,154
Lorelai.

534
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:55,995
Oh, geez, Mom, I forgot you were there. My pretending is that good.

535
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:58,607
We can’t really pretend you’re not here, Grandma.

536
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:01,750
That’s true, Emily. You have a presence that cannot be ignored.

537
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:03,947
Well, fine. I can leave.

538
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:07,839
No, no! The dog likes you there. Join in the conversation if you wish.

539
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,468
Well, I am curious to know when you girls got the bad news today.

540
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:13,516
- What bad news?
- Christopher’s news.

541
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:15,134
- What about him?
- You haven’t heard?

542
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,461
- Nothing.
- Lorelai?

543
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:17,991
- Same here.
- Well, that’s odd.

544
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,824
I would have thought he would have called them right away.

545
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:20,767
One of them, at least.

546
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:22,726
Guys, what news? You’re making me nervous here.

547
00:27:22,804 --> 00:27:25,140
- Straub died.
- Christopher’s father died?

548
00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:26,121
This morning.

549
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:27,591
Oh my God, how?

550
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:29,056
Well, he’d been sick.

551
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,635
Very badly. He’d been diagnosed just a month ago, but it already spread.

552
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:37,166
He was the picture of health, so it caught poor Francine completely off guard. That poor woman.

553
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,977
I can’t believe Chris didn’t tell us.

554
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,933
He may not have been in any shape to think straight.

555
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:42,557
Did you check all your voicemails?

556
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:44,974
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

557
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:48,087
It’s terrible having more than one answering service. That’s the way you miss things.

558
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:51,272
Well, I mean, we should send something, right? For the funeral?

559
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:53,094
Does he want us to go?

560
00:27:53,176 --> 00:27:55,770
He was very quiet on the phone, he was only good for the headlines.

561
00:27:55,852 --> 00:27:56,826
Well, you can’t blame him.

562
00:27:56,908 --> 00:28:00,728
He had a very tortured relationship with that man, but none of that matters at the end.

563
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,828
We should send him a card, or flowers.

564
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:04,202
We should send flowers.

565
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,929
Everything sounds so lame.

566
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:07,917
Well, whatever it is, send it to Francine.

567
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:10,974
Christopher and the baby are staying with her until all of this is behind them.

568
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:12,888
I’ll give you the address before you go.

569
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,558
We’ll send something together, Emily?

570
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:16,599
I’ve already signed your name to some flowers.

571
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:20,189
Oh! He moved! Is it supposed to do that?

572
00:28:20,276 --> 00:28:24,183
Oh, Emily. Let me show you how he likes his blanket arranged. He’s a bit picky.

573
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:25,442
I appreciate your help.

574
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:28,647
- Poor Chris. I mean, it’s so sudden.
- Yeah.

575
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,491
Did you even know his dad was sick?

576
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:34,055
- Well. Kind of.
- You knew?

577
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:36,057
- Dad told me.
- When did he tell you?

578
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:39,814
He didn’t make it sound like it was a big thing. Like he was that sick.

579
00:28:39,897 --> 00:28:43,578
And with Sherry gone, and the baby – yikes.

580
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,918
Yeah. Yikes.

581
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,723
...this, the bump acts as a kind of pillow.

582
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,101
Very clever!

583
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:53,911
There’s a dog hair in your drink. I’ll have Robert make you another one.

584
00:28:53,991 --> 00:28:55,036
Oh, that’s okay.

585
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,603
No, no, I insist.

586
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:59,358
Robert, we need dog hair removal.

587
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:31,271
Hi.

588
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:32,437
Hi.

589
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:33,760
I heard about your dad.

590
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,955
Yeah, I figured you would, at your Friday night dinner.

591
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,853
God, is tonight Friday?

592
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,938
I didn’t realize how serious it was.

593
00:29:42,022 --> 00:29:45,064
- I wasn’t listening.
- Rory, I kind of veiled it.

594
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:45,904
I’m sorry.

595
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:49,791
I brought cookies.

596
00:29:52,411 --> 00:29:53,293
And milk.

597
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:56,436
- Milk and cookies.
- Is that okay?

598
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:28,791
Hello?

599
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:30,787
- It’s me.
- Hey! Where are you?

600
00:30:30,868 --> 00:30:32,645
- I’m just leaving Dad’s.
- What?

601
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,982
I came to see Dad because he came to school yesterday,

602
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:40,505
wanted to make amends and have breakfast,

603
00:30:40,582 --> 00:30:44,350
but I blew him off, even after he told me that his dad was sick.

604
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:45,282
Aw, hon...

605
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,615
And, I don’t know, maybe he did say how sick he was, between the lines at least,

606
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:52,626
but I just held him off. And he didn’t say that he was dying.

607
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:56,004
I just felt so awful the whole time at dinner tonight.

608
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:57,540
- It’s okay.
- No, it’s not,

609
00:30:57,617 --> 00:31:01,626
because, regardless of Dad’s faults, he’s human and he needs us,

610
00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:08,078
but he’s so isolated from us that he can’t just call or reach out to me, or to you, especially.

611
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:13,505
But he really needed to call you, and you guys go so far back, you knew his dad.

612
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:14,973
I know, but...

613
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:20,811
And now he’s in the middle of dealing with all this sad and practical stuff of his dad’s death

614
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:24,375
and he could really use more visitors – especially you.

615
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:27,851
So go. Please. I want you to.

616
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:32,460
Well, I’m glad to hear you say this, babe, because I’m sort of pulling up behind you here.

617
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,077
Go. I’m taking off, so give him another hug for me.

618
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:37,830
I will.

619
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:41,486
And I told him to call if he needs a babysitter. Remind him of that.

620
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,745
I will. Drive safe.

621
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:04,967
You just missed Rory.

622
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,753
Eh, we’re relaying it tonight.

623
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:08,458
You guys are something else.

624
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,446
We try.

625
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:10,701
Milk and cookies?

626
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:14,525
Grown-up milk and cookies.

627
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,108
Come on in, friend.

628
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:26,732
Must you do that?

629
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,150
- Do what?
- Sip.

630
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:30,193
Sip? You object to sipping?

631
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:34,867
If it’s done at a decibel level rivaling Louis Armstrong blowing a high ‘C’ then yes! I object!

632
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,726
- I’ll put my mute on.
- Thanks, Satchmo.

633
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:39,828
Mm! We’re just minutes away from the big re-enactment!

634
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:42,958
Oh, my God, do not talk in that high-pitched girly voice of yours!

635
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:44,821
- Oh, now, come on.
- You come on.

636
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:46,291
I’m a girl, my voice is my voice.

637
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:49,009
Well, I should have had a boy in anticipation of times like this.

638
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,935
So it’s your fault.

639
00:32:50,017 --> 00:32:53,483
Or Christopher’s. Whoever supplies that girl or boy part of the chromosomes.

640
00:32:53,576 --> 00:32:54,410
It’s the guy.

641
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,268
I’m sorry I’m not vivacious.

642
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:57,820
It was for a good cause.

643
00:32:57,913 --> 00:33:00,231
I never remember to drink water. That is the key.

644
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:01,271
Lots of water!

645
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:02,362
- Pancakes!
- What about ‘em?

646
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:05,624
Surefire thing to make my head feel less awkward for being attached to my neck.

647
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,118
Then you are getting pancakes.

648
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:09,232
Have you ever been this hung over? I mean, I don’t want to know

649
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,280
because I don’t want to hear about it, but if you have, I am sorry.

650
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:15,791
And if you haven’t, maybe your life has been a little too sheltered. Good night.

651
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,544
Has anyone seen Taylor?

652
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:21,270
I need to talk to Taylor. Come on, people, time is of the essence.

653
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:22,494
Throw something sharp at him.

654
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,181
- Haven’t seen him, Kirk.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

655
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:26,243
What’s wrong?

656
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:29,666
Ah, nothing. Everything’s fine.

657
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:31,694
Lulu’s dress okay, Kirk? And answer quietly.

658
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:36,251
It’s perfect. Fits like a glove. Well, see ya.

659
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,535
I think his mother’s over-stretching his laundry again.

660
00:33:41,623 --> 00:33:44,121
Where is Luke? I need to order before I puke!

661
00:33:44,197 --> 00:33:45,728
Was Dad drinking like this last night?

662
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:49,211
Oh, he was the pusher. He just did not want to stop talking.

663
00:33:49,303 --> 00:33:52,129
Talking led to more drinking. Drinking led to more talking.

664
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:54,202
- But it was good.
- Yeah.

665
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,251
I wasn’t going to stay that long. I don’t know if he even has many friends any more.

666
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,735
All of his old buddies are scattered all around, you know?

667
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:05,400
And his support group is two and heavily into Sesame Street.

668
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:06,931
What time did you finally get home?

669
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:10,289
Sun high, birds sing, head hurts.

670
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:11,616
It was good that you went.

671
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:15,948
Yeah, I know, he needed to vent, you know? And we alternated between feeling bad

672
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:19,689
about his dad and not liking him so much for pretty much being a jerk his whole life.

673
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:22,818
Well, the one time I met Straub, he did seem a little bitter.

674
00:34:22,905 --> 00:34:25,066
The night took a very weird turn when he started coming up

675
00:34:25,122 --> 00:34:28,706
with all of his dad’s negative traits corresponding to the letters of the alphabet.

676
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:29,285
What?

677
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:34,600
‘A’ he was absent, ‘B’ he was a bully, ‘C’ he was cold, ‘D’ he was dreary...

678
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:37,179
- What was ‘K’?
- He was Kuwait-y”..

679
00:34:37,314 --> 00:34:39,074
Kuwait-y, like the country?

680
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,732
Yes, as it got later it got sillier.

681
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,293
Sounds like you’re just what he needed. You might be his oldest buddy.

682
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:48,009
True. But he talked on and on about you and how good it was that you visited.

683
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:51,496
I’m glad. We had some stuff to figure out, and we’ve pretty much figured it out.

684
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:52,218
Good.

685
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,982
- Hi!
- Oh, I didn’t know you guys were here.

686
00:34:55,064 --> 00:34:55,745
Hi, Luke.

687
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:57,083
Hello, there.

688
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,366
I had to run to the store. Look at this, this re-enactment lunacy.

689
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:03,686
Oh, we are so front row for that.

690
00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:05,786
- Your eyes are red.
- I had a bad night’s sleep last night.

691
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:07,455
- Oh, yeah? What happened?
- Well...

692
00:35:07,557 --> 00:35:09,882
Oh, I kept her up pretty late, you know, girl talk.

693
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:12,483
Oh, okay. So what do you guys want to eat?

694
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:14,725
- Well, she will have...
- More coffee, that’s all I want.

695
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:16,656
Okay, how about you Rory?

696
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:18,802
Yeah, I guess I’m fine with just coffee, too.

697
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:20,076
Oh, you two are easy.

698
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:21,750
- Spread that around, will you?
- Will do.

699
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:23,281
What about your pancakes?

700
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:26,379
Pancakes are hangover food, it would get him suspicious.

701
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:27,648
Well, I could have ordered them for you.

702
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:30,577
- Well, I wasn’t stopping you.
- I just wasn’t fast enough.

703
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:33,378
I shouldn’t have lied about where I was last night.

704
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,543
I’m over nineteen and lying to my boyfriend about stuff. That’s wrong.

705
00:35:36,614 --> 00:35:37,304
Okay.

706
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:40,341
I could just say his father died and I went over to comfort him.

707
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,183
With tequila. Which we drank, all night long, alone.

708
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,943
He didn’t need to know. It’s better that he doesn’t know.

709
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:47,720
He didn’t need to know.

710
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:50,284
Ooh, the re-enactment! It’s starting!

711
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:50,981
Voice.

712
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,530
- The re-enactment. It’s starting.
- Much better, let’s go.

713
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,672
Welcome to Stars Hollow’s new, historically accurate Revolutionary War re-enactment.

714
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:05,532
And to the members of the press I’d like to point out that my best side is my right side.

715
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,559
Left side’s fine, too. I was just kidding.

716
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,308
People forget that men of the cloth can crack jokes, too.

717
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:16,493
Anyway, I’d like to introduce three special participants, Bobby, Tara and Craig,

718
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,294
who were chosen from our own Stars Hollow elementary school

719
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,127
to narrate what you see today.

720
00:36:21,634 --> 00:36:24,972
- The year...
- Seventeen Seventy-Nine.

721
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:27,538
- The location...
- Stars Hollow.

722
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,861
Children should shoot us for what we make them do.

723
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:35,114
...fortune turning point when our brave town militia learned

724
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:38,582
that a powerful British general was riding through the area

725
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:42,734
to rejoin his troops and wage a decisive battle.

726
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:44,753
It inspired an idea.

727
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:49,651
First, the militia went off to block the high road.

728
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:52,084
Come on, men! Let’s block the high road!

729
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:54,777
What about horses? Wouldn’t they have had horses?

730
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:57,572
Or at least some coconuts to bang together for a nice sound effect.

731
00:36:57,895 --> 00:37:00,178
Brave our soldiers are.

732
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:05,686
The British general had no choice but to take the only path or road on this snowy day.

733
00:37:05,826 --> 00:37:08,523
The road through Stars Hollow.

734
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:13,077
Soon a scout arrived to warn of the general’s coming.

735
00:37:13,153 --> 00:37:15,994
The British general is coming! The British general is coming!

736
00:37:16,158 --> 00:37:17,258
So expositional.

737
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:19,317
I guess Tony Kushner wasn’t available.

738
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,399
And then the general arrived.

739
00:37:22,503 --> 00:37:26,207
It’s certainly unfortunate that the high road was blocked this day,

740
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:28,176
forcing me to ride through town.

741
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:30,417
Seriously. This dialogue is worse than From Justin To Kelly.

742
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:35,666
Then a brave woman put herself in harm’s way and emerged to distract the general.

743
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:38,983
- Is that your dress?
- Yeah.

744
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,527
I made it to Lulu’s specifications. Did she get bonier all of a sudden?

745
00:37:42,618 --> 00:37:43,315
And taller?

746
00:37:43,437 --> 00:37:47,498
Good day, fair lady. You intrigue me.

747
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:49,245
What have you to say?

748
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:52,905
- Kirk!
- Kirk?

749
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,994
No wonder her breasts weren’t holding it up.

750
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,806
What are you doing? Where’s Lulu?

751
00:37:56,884 --> 00:37:57,789
She’s sick.

752
00:37:57,995 --> 00:38:00,514
I tried to find you but you weren’t around and I didn’t know what to do.

753
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,199
Everyone’s looking!

754
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:06,127
I didn’t want to let the town down, with the press here and all, so I just did it myself.

755
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,951
That’s the ugliest lady I’ve ever seen.

756
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:14,291
This is far and away the worst thing you have ever done. I am livid with you!

757
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,288
We’re not supposed to be arguing, Taylor.

758
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,710
We’re supposed to be making love.

759
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,196
Dear God.

760
00:38:29,003 --> 00:38:33,902
This simple, common woman whose livelihood defied laws of morality

761
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:36,825
but acting in a fashion which God would forgive her,

762
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,820
led the British general to the warmth of her boudoir.

763
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:41,899
She saved Stars Hollow.

764
00:38:43,252 --> 00:38:44,194
Reverend.

765
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,073
Sorry.

766
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:49,267
The British general was kept occupied long enough for Lafayette’s troops

767
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:53,223
to ambush his men – a decisive victory for the colonists.

768
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:59,005
Thanks to the Stars Hollow militia and the woman whose livelihood...

769
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,748
- Now what? Is it over?
- No idea.

770
00:39:01,697 --> 00:39:03,460
How far are Kirk and Taylor going to take this thing?

771
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,119
I’m not leaving ‘till I find out.

772
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:07,263
I have to get back to the Inn. Keep me posted.

773
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:08,185
I’m riveted.

774
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:17,927
Hello.

775
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:20,233
Hello, Richard. How are you?

776
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,646
Very good. And you?

777
00:39:21,784 --> 00:39:22,705
Excellent.

778
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:24,697
I was going to check on the dog.

779
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:27,574
I was thinking of putting up some fliers around the neighborhood.

780
00:39:27,651 --> 00:39:29,474
Fliers are tacky, but they work.

781
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:33,105
And I thought you could look up on your computer where the best place to print them is.

782
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:34,170
The dog is gone.

783
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:35,961
Gone? He’s gone?

784
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,114
She’s gone.

785
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:38,666
I thought you said it was a boy.

786
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,689
Well, apparently I misread what I saw.

787
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,157
She was very hairy down there.

788
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,717
Your calls paid off. Some one you called called someone else,

789
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:49,673
and somehow found the owner and she came and picked the dog up, late last night.

790
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,260
I didn’t even hear anyone come by.

791
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,610
Well, I would have called to let you know but I didn’t see a light on

792
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:55,981
- and I didn’t want to disturb you.
- It wouldn’t have disturbed me.

793
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:57,747
Well, now I’ll know for next time.

794
00:39:57,916 --> 00:40:00,347
Not that we’ll ever find a dog in the yard again.

795
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:02,259
Yes. Well.

796
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:07,271
I hope you told them to get an I.D. tag for it. It’s irresponsible not to have one.

797
00:40:07,348 --> 00:40:09,062
I told them how much they put us out.

798
00:40:09,149 --> 00:40:11,847
I missed a half day’s work, and you were inconvenienced even more.

799
00:40:11,935 --> 00:40:14,044
Yes. Yes, I was.

800
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:16,625
Her name was Princess, by the way.

801
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,536
Was it? Princess?

802
00:40:22,907 --> 00:40:25,328
Well, I should get back to the house. I’ve got a million things to do.

803
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:26,861
I have to go to work.

804
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:36,052
Believe me, I know the futility of fighting Mother Nature.

805
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:39,122
She’s been a real mother” lately. Almost rivals my mother.

806
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,714
Yeah, but you and your plow do control Mother Nature’s droppings, a. k.a. the snow,

807
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:50,213
and all I’m saying is could you try to keep it from blocking the Dragonfly’s one and only driveway?

808
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:54,022
You know, it kind of blocks us in and we get all cranky and claustrophobic,

809
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,148
especially when we’re out of coffee. Which I’m not anticipating,

810
00:40:56,208 --> 00:41:00,729
but I didn’t anticipate it before and it happened, and I suffered with drawal pains.

811
00:41:02,423 --> 00:41:05,097
Right. Well, I really appreciate it.

812
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:07,855
I actually like plows, you know? They look like fun.

813
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:12,741
Right. I’m sure plowing doesn’t pay enough, though. That part’s not fun.

814
00:41:12,832 --> 00:41:14,824
I used to be a maid. I know low wages.

815
00:41:15,946 --> 00:41:20,651
Well, I’m really not comfortable telling you what I made then or what I make now.

816
00:41:20,718 --> 00:41:22,752
Just, anything you can do will help.

817
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:24,578
Okay, thank you.

818
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:29,254
- What is this?
- It’s an ice rink.

819
00:41:29,376 --> 00:41:31,583
An ice rink? How did this happen?

820
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:32,823
Jack Frost brought it.

821
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:35,627
- Does he look like Luke Danes?
- A little. Not as handsome.

822
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,461
You made me an ice rink?

823
00:41:37,553 --> 00:41:40,718
It’s just a rink in a box. You set it up, you fill it with water, it’s not a big deal.

824
00:41:41,141 --> 00:41:44,250
It is a big deal. It’s a very big deal.

825
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:45,432
Here. Try it out.

826
00:41:46,697 --> 00:41:49,417
My dad did this for me once. I was in a hockey phase.

827
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:53,184
‘Till I broke my nose the first time. Skated right into a tree.

828
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:55,928
What in the world inspired you to do this?

829
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:59,410
Well, I felt kind of bad about you and snow, the rough time you were having,

830
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,646
and I really wasn’t helping any by saying all that stuff about snow

831
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:06,240
being a pain and impractical, and it’s just icy water falling from the sky,

832
00:42:06,532 --> 00:42:09,753
and I thought maybe I’d get you two back together. Make you feel better about snow again.

833
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:10,552
Oh, yeah?

834
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:12,850
I’m grumpy about stuff but I don’t want you to be.

835
00:42:15,106 --> 00:42:16,066
Careful.

836
00:42:17,028 --> 00:42:18,272
I’m being careful.

837
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,220
- Thanks for reconciling us.
- Any time.

838
00:42:23,547 --> 00:42:25,065
You were lying this morning.

839
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:26,050
What?

840
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:29,137
You said you were fine but you didn’t look it. You get sick or something last night?

841
00:42:29,398 --> 00:42:33,244
No. No, I just had a headache. Still do. Just one of those things.

842
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:35,844
Yeah, I get headaches. I just feel bad.

843
00:42:36,074 --> 00:42:37,513
That’s all it was, a headache.

844
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:40,007
- I love this ice rink!
- Try it out.

845
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,794
- Oh, it’s great!
- Keep away from trees.

846
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:51,829
Ah, I look like a dork but I love it.

847
00:42:51,922 --> 00:42:52,746
You look fine.

848
00:42:54,061 --> 00:42:55,480
You want to be Randy to my Tai?

849
00:42:55,578 --> 00:42:57,206
Nah, I’ll just watch.
