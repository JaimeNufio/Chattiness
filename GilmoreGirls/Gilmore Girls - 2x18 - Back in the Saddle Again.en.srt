1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,295
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,506
The person who buys the basket
wins the company...

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,508
of the person who makes
the basket for lunch.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,802
Basket, basket maker.
Guy who didn't bring enough money.

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,262
You think this is funny?

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,265
You know what I'm going through
at work? I am being phased out.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,892
- What's going on?
- Dean's on his way.

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,393
Rory doesn't want him to find me.

9
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,271
- Jess just came by to bring me some food.
- From Luke's.

10
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,606
Rory wouldn't lie, right?

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,858
Suddenly, I heard myself resign.

12
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,444
No, Rory wouldn't lie.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,832
- Mom?
- No.

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,585
- We're starving.
- We're waiting for your father.

15
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,004
- It'll get cold.
- We're waiting for your father.

16
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,423
- We've been waiting forever.
- We have not.

17
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,675
Godot was just here, he said:

18
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,303
'I ain't waiting for Richard,'
grabbed a roll and left. It's been forever.

19
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,222
When we gather as a family,
we eat as one.

20
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,308
We don't eat in shifts, you know that,
and so does Richard.

21
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,562
- When did he get that antique car?
- A couple of horrible weeks ago.

22
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,522
What happened to that oil-painting hobby?

23
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,276
When he couldn't foresee rivaling Cézanne
he lost interest...

24
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,528
so he bought that car. Lorelai!

25
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,322
Mom, it's not dinner.
It's just my private stash.

26
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,700
It's eating, and we're not eating.

27
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,704
You're bound by the rules of the
Geneva Convention just like everyone else.

28
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,373
- No one told me it was Casual Friday.
- Hello, everyone.

29
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,457
You haven't started?

30
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,085
We were waiting for you.
I thought you were almost done.

31
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,045
I was, but this car has a mind of its own.

32
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,048
As I turned to leave,
it began spraying a green solution at me.

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,425
- Yuck.
- Yuck, indeed.

34
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,511
- Go on, start, no sense in waiting for me.
- Coolness.

35
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,929
- Stop.
- Gomer said...

36
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,639
We are waiting for you, Richard.

37
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,309
In 35 years, I have never started
a dinner without you...

38
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,227
unless you were out of town or ill.

39
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,396
Elsa, take everything away
and keep it warm.

40
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,525
Now please go upstairs and get ready
so we can all enjoy a nice family dinner...

41
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,568
together.

42
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,238
- I'll be right back.
- Right back, Dad.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,866
Change on the way upstairs,
make it a navy shower...

44
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,744
quick soap, quick rinse,
and no excessive posing.

45
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,329
Hungry.

46
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,973
- Hey, there. Anywhere?
- Anywhere you want.

47
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,394
- Could you move, please?
- What?

48
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:09,690
- Anywhere where there's no people.
- Like I'm a mind-reader. I was just joking.

49
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,526
- That's funny.
- What?

50
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,071
Something's different here,
something's changed.

51
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,490
- Impossible.
- No, I swear, there's something.

52
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,118
I'd be very disappointed
if something changed in here.

53
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,369
Why are you so anti-change?

54
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,163
- Because most change sucks.
- That's true, it does.

55
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,915
- The chalkboard.
- What about it?

56
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,043
That is brand-new.

57
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,628
A new special?

58
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,798
His four-slice French toast
has been up there since I was born.

59
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,925
- You have to let that go.
- What can I get you?

60
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,552
- You have a new special.
- I sure do.

61
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,180
- Nice, what is the special omelette?
- You won't like it.

62
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,264
How do you know?

63
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,224
I know what you like, you won't like it.

64
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,102
- Can I hear what it is?
- It's three eggs with bits of bacon...

65
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,145
I like bacon.

66
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,522
Cubed tomatoes, Swiss cheese,
and a dash of oregano.

67
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,524
- A dash, he says.
- I've got other customers.

68
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,444
I'm gonna go with the special omelette,
with a side of bacon.

69
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,613
- There's bacon in the omelette.
- Skip the bacon.

70
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,781
- The side of bacon?
- The bacon in the omelette.

71
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,202
Can I get Jack cheese instead of Swiss?
Swiss is so stringy.

72
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,453
Fine, Jack cheese.

73
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,748
I think I'm allergic to oregano,
so hold that, too. And some coffee.

74
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,292
So just the eggs, tomatoes,
and Jack cheese.

75
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,461
- Not too many tomatoes.
- Light on the tomatoes.

76
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,631
Very light, just a teeny, tiny amount,
practically none.

77
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,550
I'm skipping the tomatoes.
It's an omelette with Jack cheese.

78
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,344
- You did this on purpose.
- Did what?

79
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,887
French toast for me.

80
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,849
- That was cruel.
- I know.

81
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,769
Look how hard he worked on that sign
and everything.

82
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,523
Look at the handwriting.
It's so precise, so determined.

83
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,607
It's Focused Luke.

84
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,859
- That's Jess's handwriting.
- Really?

85
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,903
How do you know Jess's writing?

86
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,239
I lent him a book,
and he wrote some stuff in it.

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,740
He vandalized one of your books?

88
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,118
He didn't vandalize it, he wrote
in the margins, thoughts and stuff.

89
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,121
What, like, 'play basketball,
eat a sandwich,' stuff like that?

90
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,999
No, like margin stuff.

91
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,835
People like Mark Twain wrote in margins.

92
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,962
'Pilot a steamboat,
write Huckleberry Finn. '

93
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,257
- Forget it.
- No, I'm sure margin writing is common.

94
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,009
You didn't tell me Dean was joining us.

95
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,052
Hi.

96
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,098
- What are you doing here?
- I just dropped by to say hello.

97
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,392
- How'd you know we were here?
- You're always here.

98
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:12,104
- We're not always here.
- Do you want to eat with us, Dean?

99
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:16,441
- Rory, is that okay?
- Yes, you don't have to ask.

100
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,153
We're three.

101
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,947
I did the math. You gonna eat something?

102
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,616
Sure, yeah, I'll take the special omelette.

103
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,369
- You put him up to this?
- No, I did not.

104
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,413
- You don't know what's in it.
- I'm not picky.

105
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,290
- You'll send it back after I make it?
- No.

106
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,209
Right, I'll come back when
I've got time for this.

107
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,086
What was that all about?

108
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,423
I think it was a little something
in your attitude, mister.

109
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,052
So is everything in the materials
clear to everyone?

110
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,137
Pretty much.

111
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,638
Were we reading these now?

112
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,641
Yeah, that's why we've all been quiet
for the past 10 minutes.

113
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,977
I thought it was, like,
prayer time or something.

114
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,020
Good grief.

115
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,646
- I'm still reading mine.
- What?

116
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,315
I read slow so I don't miss anything.

117
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,691
It's not the Bhagavad-Gita.

118
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,902
It's simple instructions
for the business fair.

119
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,905
- Someone's not taking to Elba too kindly.
- What does that mean?

120
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,657
Rory's the leader of this group, Napoleon,
and you're not.

121
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,577
Excuse me, leader, you want to lead here?
You've got anarchy.

122
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,120
I'm just enjoying the show.

123
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,414
Hi, I think this is my group.

124
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:15,000
- Brad, hey.
- You remember me.

125
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,835
- Of course I do.
- Cool.

126
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,254
- So you're back at Chilton now.
- Yeah.

127
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,174
My psychiatrist convinced my parents
I should face my fears...

128
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,885
instead of running away.
My rabbi agreed, so here I am.

129
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,179
Nice to have you back. Take a seat.

130
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,352
Paris?

131
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,357
- Her name is Paris, right?
- Brad, let me catch you up here.

132
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,734
There's going to be a
business fair in three weeks.

133
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,153
Each group has to come up
with a consumer product...

134
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,738
- for high-school kids.
- Neat.

135
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,658
So we pick our product
and we make a prototype of it.

136
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,952
Then we use our imaginary
million-dollar budget...

137
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,204
to mass-produce, market, and distribute it.

138
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,873
- And we'll present all of this at the fair.
- Cool.

139
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,001
Brad, your festive interjections
are a real kick in the pants...

140
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,878
but we're low on time, so can it.

141
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,590
That's it. In two days, we're going
to reconvene and pitch product ideas.

142
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:07,177
- Class dismissed?
- We haven't discussed business advisors.

143
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,472
Right, we're supposed to get a parent
who's in business to advise us.

144
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,557
Anyone score?

145
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,767
My dad's got scheduling conflicts
up the wazoo.

146
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,561
- No for Chip.
- My dad's in Hong Kong...

147
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,563
but he can video-conference in, if need be.

148
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,398
- No for Paris.
- My dad's traveling.

149
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,483
My dad's in court for the next six weeks.

150
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,734
- Lawyer?
- Defendant.

151
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,819
We won't pry.

152
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,571
I have no idea what he's up on anyway.

153
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,699
- No one's mom works?
- Working moms are so 90s.

154
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,035
My mom works. She's a curator
at the Hartford Natural Museum.

155
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:36,748
We need experienced business advisors,
not someone who poses animal carcasses.

156
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,667
- What about your mom?
- My mom?

157
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,421
- That's right, she runs a hotel.
- It's just an inn, a small inn.

158
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,590
- It's still a business.
- She must keep books.

159
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,300
Yeah, but they're really small books.

160
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,721
It's not perfect, but it's a better option
than Brad's mom, the buffalo stuffer.

161
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,265
She doesn't stuff the animals.
That's taxidermy.

162
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,893
Who is this rabbi
that encouraged you to come back here?

163
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,353
Give me his address,
I'm gonna go pop him one.

164
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,564
Hold it, I don't think my mom
is right for this.

165
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,525
You need to do whatever it takes
to make it happen.

166
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,527
Otherwise you shouldn't be
the group leader.

167
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:09,072
- A coup d'état, how exciting.
- There's no coup d'état.

168
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,949
- I'll ask her.
- Good.

169
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,704
30, 31, 32.

170
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,789
- Sookie, look.
- 33, 34, 35.

171
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,583
Can't look. Making meringue.

172
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,752
- 37. Fine science.
- You got a package.

173
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:26,173
- 39, got to count to 40. Can't over-whip.
- I think it's your wedding invitations.

174
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,176
Gimme, I got to see them.

175
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,345
You're gonna love these.

176
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,640
They're pearly white
with this beautiful lavender strip.

177
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,144
I'm gonna choke somebody by the neck
until brains ooze out of their ears.

178
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,980
- What? They're beautiful.
- The name, look at the name.

179
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,274
'... the marriage of his daughter
Susie St. James. '

180
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,485
- Who's Susie St. James?
- I think it's you.

181
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,403
- What am I going to do?
- It can be changed.

182
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,156
- These have to go out in a week.
- We're calling right now.

183
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,242
I am so not a Susie.

184
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:57,246
- Good morning. Beautiful morning.
- It sucks from where I'm sitting.

185
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,832
Lorelai, you remember I have
tomorrow afternoon off.

186
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,085
- I remember. Big plans?
- Yes, my mother is coming to visit.

187
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,671
Hello, yes.
Customer service, please. Thanks.

188
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,130
- Sorry.
- About what?

189
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,676
- You said your mother's coming.
- But I'm excited, I never get to see her.

190
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,262
I must be projecting.
Your mother's coming for a visit!

191
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,472
- She's coming for three days.
- She staying here?

192
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,141
- No, she stays with me, of course.
- In your tiny place?

193
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,895
She's fine with it, we stay up all night
gabbing and watching movies.

194
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:25,148
- We have a ball.
- Wow, I can't wait to meet her.

195
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,152
Hello, we have a problem with
some wedding invitations we ordered.

196
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:32,239
- Okay, they're transferring me.
- I heard that.

197
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,658
He is really happy
about his mother coming to visit.

198
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,035
- I heard that, too.
- Totally foreign to me.

199
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,497
Hi, great.
I'm going to pass you over to my friend...

200
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,875
who has a problem
with some merchandise she ordered.

201
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,001
Hold on one sec.

202
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,043
Listen to me.

203
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,130
I have experience dealing
with people who screwed something up.

204
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,800
You have a better chance
if you don't get all hysterical.

205
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,135
- Okay.
- Okay.

206
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,222
How dare you do this to me?
You're ruining my wedding.

207
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,057
It's the most important day of my life.

208
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,644
It's my life, not 'Susie St. James. '
Are you listening to me?

209
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,521
- Good girl.
- You'd better be listening.

210
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,732
No, you be quiet and listen.

211
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,900
Hi.

212
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,860
Thought you couldn't get here till later.

213
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,237
Our meeting didn't go as long
as I thought it would.

214
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:16,366
Lucky for me, more work for you.
Here, chronological order, please.

215
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,869
- How was your day?
- I got an 'A' on my Physics test...

216
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,498
finished Candide, and convinced a boy
that Paris wouldn't attack his rabbi.

217
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,541
- So, uneventful.
- Pretty much.

218
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,295
Mom, I know
you'll probably not want to do this...

219
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,839
Yes, I will,
unless it's something I don't want to do.

220
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:34,092
Do you want to be the parent advisor
on my Economics project?

221
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,595
- Rory, gosh.
- I'm kind of in a spot.

222
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,971
- No one else can do it?
- Nope.

223
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,515
- You checked, double-checked?
- Yes.

224
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,768
And no one else can do it,
so you came slumming after me?

225
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,520
- Of course.
- I appreciate that.

226
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,314
- I'm totally stuck.
- If you're stuck, I'll do it.

227
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,901
What about your grandfather,
retired business titan?

228
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,611
- What about him?
- He'd be perfect.

229
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,071
This is a business project...

230
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,824
and the word 'business' has been taboo
in that house since he left the firm.

231
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,160
Asking him might remind him of that
and upset him.

232
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,246
Or he'll be thrilled
that you thought of him.

233
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,790
You're not saying that
because you don't want to do it?

234
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,292
No, I really think he would enjoy
helping you.

235
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:11,922
Then I wouldn't have to feel guilty about
being so reluctant to help you out myself.

236
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,675
- All right, I'll give it a shot.
- Good girl.

237
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,261
Would you really have felt guilty?

238
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,138
No, but I would have felt guilty
about not feeling guilty...

239
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,682
and that could go on forever.

240
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,934
Miss Gilmore in the vicious circle.

241
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,817
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Rory, this is a surprise.

242
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,319
I was just in the area,
and I thought I'd pay a call.

243
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,696
How very Continental of you.

244
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,283
I would hug you, but I have various forms
of viscous fluid on my clothing.

245
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,034
- I'll take a rain check.
- Very good.

246
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,413
- How's she running?
- She's a bit obstinate today.

247
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,623
- Girls can get that way.
- Indeed.

248
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,542
So, you were in the neighborhood.

249
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,336
Yeah, and I actually
have a little favor to ask you.

250
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,088
Ask away.

251
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:57,384
There's this project at school,
and it's for my Economics class.

252
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,386
- Good subject. Pragmatic.
- Yeah.

253
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,098
And we have to come up with
a consumer product, all make-believe...

254
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,102
and there's sort of a contest at the end,
and we sort of need an advisor.

255
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:11,023
- An advisor.
- Someone who's experienced in business...

256
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,859
who can come to a few meetings,
make suggestions.

257
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:17,863
I totally understand if you can't do it,
but I just thought I would ask.

258
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,366
I'm not sure how much help I could be.

259
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,952
I've never actually created
a consumer product.

260
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,038
That's okay. We kids haven't either.

261
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,789
Yes, I suppose you haven't.

262
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:31,210
If you can't do it or if you don't
want to do it, I totally understand.

263
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:34,338
Things are a little bit hectic right now.

264
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,591
- Yeah, I know.
- And it is short notice, after all.

265
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,134
Very short.

266
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,094
You know what? Forget I even asked.

267
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,389
- Rory, I didn't know you were here.
- Hi, Grandma.

268
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,559
- You didn't hug your grandfather, did you?
- I took a rain check.

269
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:51,188
- I better go.
- You just got here, we have cookies.

270
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,607
No, thank you.
Mom's expecting me at the inn.

271
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,152
Grandpa, really, don't worry about it.
I just thought I would ask.

272
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,738
- I'm fine, Rory. Thank you for asking.
- Bye.

273
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,074
Ask what? What did she ask?

274
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,576
Something for Economics class.
It's nothing really.

275
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,663
That doesn't sound like nothing.
What about her Economics class?

276
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:12,209
No, Emily, she merely asked me
to participate in some project at school...

277
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,336
- and I respectfully declined.
- You declined?

278
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,672
- Leave it, Emily.
- Why would you decline?

279
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,924
Let's talk about it later, Emily. I'm busy.

280
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,344
Busy? You've been poking around
that stupid engine for three weeks...

281
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,805
and all it does is spray at you.
You're not too busy.

282
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,517
I am in the middle of something,
and I don't expect you to understand it.

283
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,436
- You're not going to help her?
- Can we talk about this later?

284
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,772
- I never thought I'd see the day...
- What day?

285
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,942
...Richard Gilmore would
disappoint his granddaughter like this.

286
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,654
- Emily, please.
- Is this how it's going to be from now on?

287
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,864
What are you talking about?

288
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,907
I just want to know
what to expect from you...

289
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,201
because the bouncing
from one thing to another...

290
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:49,121
the moping in silence in your den,
all of that I accepted...

291
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,165
but your turning your back on Rory...

292
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,958
I did not turn my back on her.

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,752
You adore that little girl.
She means everything to you.

294
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,546
- Emily.
- Are you that lost?

295
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:04,344
I'm incredibly disappointed
in you, Richard.

296
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,812
- Sales.
- It's just a stupid test.

297
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,440
'Lane Kim, you have shown
a genuine aptitude for sales. '

298
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,608
It doesn't mean anything.

299
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,902
'Ma'am, I see you're eyeing
the new Whip-o-Matic.

300
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,403
'This baby's right off the truck.

301
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,779
'If you're looking something...

302
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,824
'to fulfill your whipping needs,
you've come to the right place.

303
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:26,909
'As Devo says:

304
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,912
'If there's a problem, you must whip it'
with a Whip-o-Matic. '

305
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,497
You are good. I'll take two.

306
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,333
I don't want to be in sales.
I want to do something cool.

307
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,251
- Sell refrigerators.
- You're not funny.

308
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:39,254
You are taking this aptitude test
way too seriously.

309
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,465
It's the fourth time it's come up 'sales. '

310
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,634
In 10 years,
we will be having lunch in Paris...

311
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,928
and we'll not be discussing
if you made your quota.

312
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,430
- So I'm gonna be a sucky salesman?
- Changing subject.

313
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,848
Hey.

314
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,142
- How are you?
- I'm only as good as my last sale.

315
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,186
- She's lost her mind.
- Got it.

316
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:57,147
- So what are you doing?
- We're going to buy some shoes.

317
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,025
- And pick up a job application.
- You will now face the wall.

318
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,861
After you're done shoe-shopping,
come by my softball game.

319
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:06,490
You haven't been to a game in a while.
You said you missed seeing them.

320
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,076
I do, but, I thought we were
getting together tonight.

321
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,870
- We are.
- I should finish my Philosophy homework.

322
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,956
- Do it at the game.
- My homework?

323
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,792
Doesn't that defeat the point
of going to see you play?

324
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,169
You can't glance up
in between nihilistic theories?

325
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,380
- I can, but what's the point?
- What?

326
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:26,885
Why don't I do my homework at home,
and I will go see you play next week?

327
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,264
- I promise I'll be there.
- Okay, sure.

328
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,850
- Great. So tonight?
- I'll be by at 7:00.

329
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,726
Okay, so have a good game.

330
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,355
Do that pointing-to-the-outfield thing,
it's always very popular.

331
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,609
- Bye, Lane.
- Come again soon.

332
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:50,492
Here, and here. Cleaning supplier, there.

333
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,746
Here, staff insurance forms.

334
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,582
Initial here. Date it here.

335
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,624
And I just...

336
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,295
You just okayed the vaccination of all
those filthy ducks in the south pond.

337
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,755
- Very nice.
- Yes, a regular Dr. Dolittle.

338
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,595
You are gorgeous. Come.

339
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,227
What are you doing here?
I was going to pick you up at the airport.

340
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,521
- You wicked creature.
- I had to come early.

341
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:24,443
I wanted to buy presents before I see you.
I know you are a materialistic vulture.

342
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,028
All right, back up.

343
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,322
Thank God I have the perfect son.

344
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,074
If you had been ugly,
I don't know what I would have done.

345
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,285
- Boarding school?
- In Switzerland.

346
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,121
Lorelai, this is my mother, Giselle.

347
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,623
It's very nice to meet you.

348
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,834
- My God, those eyes, are they real?
- Yes, they are.

349
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,589
God is terribly cruel to bestow those eyes
and that face to one person.

350
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,716
I'm sorry, can you be my mom, too?

351
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,761
- I'm going to show her around, okay?
- Make sure you see Sookie.

352
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,387
- Why?
- She wants to meet your mom.

353
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,766
Yes, Michel, I must meet your friends.
I did not raise you to be rude.

354
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,645
- You did too.
- No, I didn't. Come, show me off.

355
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,064
Have you been using those free weights
I sent you?

356
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,274
Yes, they hold down
my papers beautifully.

357
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,903
- Lazy, silly woman.
- Cruel and vicious boy.

358
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,489
I really appreciate
you doing this, Grandpa.

359
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,615
Of course.

360
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,076
I know you weren't really thrilled
with the idea.

361
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,494
No, that's not true.

362
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,080
I told everybody to have
their idea pitches prepared...

363
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,082
so we can get you in and out quickly.

364
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,752
Rory, this is an assignment.
We will give it the time it requires.

365
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:27,673
- However, efficient is always best.
- I totally understand.

366
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,888
Everyone, this is my grandfather,
Richard Gilmore.

367
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,684
This is Louise, Madeline, Paris, Brad,
and Chip.

368
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,561
Nice to meet you all.

369
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,063
Do you want to say a few words
before we start?

370
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,648
No, I'm just here to advise.

371
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,568
I'll sit back here and observe...

372
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,820
and advise if necessary.

373
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,032
Okay. I guess we can start
with the idea pitches.

374
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,951
- Who wants to go first?
- I will.

375
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,578
Okay, Louise has the floor.

376
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,873
I couldn't find my lip gloss this morning,
and I'd just bought it.

377
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,624
It's the perfect shade of pink...

378
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,169
plus it has this major shine
with minor stickiness...

379
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,755
meaning no fear of your hair
sticking to your face when it's windy.

380
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,174
- A coup.
- I know.

381
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,344
Of course, 15 minutes later,
tardy and glossless...

382
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:18,307
I left the house, and I had to rely on
Madeline for my source of lip color.

383
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,518
- Not an ideal solution.
- Major skin-tone mismatch.

384
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,936
I'm sorry, group leader...

385
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,315
could you ask the Pigeon Sisters
if there is a point to this opus?

386
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,234
- Louise, what's your idea?
- A lipstick LoJack.

387
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,112
- Excuse me?
- A lipstick tracking device.

388
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,489
You attach it to a tube,
hook it up to a remote...

389
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,159
and the next time you're searching,
just point and shoot.

390
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,785
I'd buy one.

391
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,371
Okay, Louise,
that's a very interesting idea...

392
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:45,083
but I think we should think of something
that appeals to both boys and girls.

393
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,586
- Anyone else?
- Okay, I've got one.

394
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,088
A locker robot.

395
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,592
It would talk and tell you facts,
help you with your homework...

396
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:58,222
carry your stuff, and you could fit it in
your locker until you're ready to go home.

397
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:03,810
But that means that we would
actually have to build a robot.

398
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,395
Yes, we would.

399
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,106
- Who knows how to do that?
- I don't know.

400
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,277
- He looks like he should know.
- I've never built a robot.

401
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,404
But you've tried, haven't you?

402
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,281
Yes, I have.

403
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:20,786
Okay, let's just try to keep the ideas down
to things that we can actually accomplish.

404
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,663
And I guess Paris is next.

405
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,916
The average teenager spends
seven hours a day at school.

406
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,002
Seven hours where he or she
is walking from class to class...

407
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,255
indoors, outdoors, in all types of weather.

408
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:35,092
At the same time, that same teenager
is going through major physical changes...

409
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,969
within his or her own body.

410
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,638
The combo of the action
with the environment...

411
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:43,267
in addition to the hormonal imbalance
can only lead to one thing:

412
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,477
- Accidents.
- What are you talking about?

413
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,355
Monday morning,
Muffin wakes up and looks in the mirror.

414
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,232
'Oh, no, I have a zit on my face.

415
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,735
'I'll just look down when I walk
so Hunky Football Player won't notice. '

416
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,990
And Muffin smacks right into
the cafeteria wall. That's got to hurt.

417
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,283
Who's Muffin?

418
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,702
This is why I'm proposing
manufacturing something...

419
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,954
that no teenager should be without.

420
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,623
- A first-aid kit.
- A first-aid kit?

421
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:10,294
Specially designed to fit in a locker
with minimum space disruption.

422
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:15,340
Band-aids, antiseptic, cotton balls,
Q- tips, ace bandages, aspirin.

423
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,176
I don't know. It's possible.

424
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,011
Does anyone have any questions about it?

425
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,346
They sell these things
in every drug store, right?

426
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,472
Yes, they do.

427
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,808
There's also a registered nurse on campus.

428
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,768
Her office would contain the products...

429
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,937
- that you're talking about, correct?
- Possibly.

430
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,691
What makes you think you could get
a young person to spend good money...

431
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:37,196
on something that they could get for free,
or at least, at a lower cost?

432
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,907
Because I know one thing
about the modern teenager.

433
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,991
And what is that?

434
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:44,036
You can get them to buy anything
if it comes in a leopard print.

435
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,497
- True.
- We get them with style.

436
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:50,083
We dress up the kits with sparkles,
colors, pictures of bands...

437
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:54,087
sport themes for the boys, animal pictures
for the puppy-and-unicorn bunch...

438
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:57,674
chessboards for the Bobby Fischer freaks.
A style for every taste.

439
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:01,970
Plus we use neon band-aids,
pink or blue gauze for the bandages...

440
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,056
anything that seems young
or flashy or bright.

441
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,392
And that is how you intend to set
the business world on its ear?

442
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,895
- That's right.
- Tricked-out first-aid kits.

443
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:13,273
- For the locker.
- And you really think that's going to work.

444
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,526
Yes. I do.

445
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,946
- So do I.
- Really?

446
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,573
It's perfect. It's simple,
it's easy to produce.

447
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:23,617
The possibilities are endless. I love it.

448
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,911
Well, I think we've got our product.

449
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,871
We need to go through this point by point.

450
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,248
Okay, let's do it.

451
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:34,086
The secret to a great campaign
is a great idea. We've got that.

452
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,921
Let's move on to finances.

453
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,424
Do any of you have dinner plans?
We're going to be here for a while.

454
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,261
Let's all turn to Page 4.

455
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,637
Here we go.

456
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,139
January projections...

457
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:53,939
Mom?

458
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,651
Hello?

459
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,280
That ringing is not in your head,
you know?

460
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,158
You got to read this MÖtley Crue book.

461
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:07,744
I swear, you get to the point where
Ozzy Osbourne snorts a row of ants...

462
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,205
and you think, 'It cannot get any grosser. '

463
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,126
Then you turn the page,
and, hello, yes, it can. It's excellent.

464
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,586
Why didn't you answer the phone?

465
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,505
Because once you've
experienced something 5,000 times...

466
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,841
- you need to move on.
- What are you talking about?

467
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,259
- I knew who it was.
- Who?

468
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:25,888
The person who's called the machine
so many times that I heard it sigh.

469
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,140
- Dean?
- Dean the Determined.

470
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,560
- Man.
- $5 says I know who that is.

471
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,479
- Hello.
- Rory. It's your grandfather.

472
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:37,107
- Hey, Grandpa.
- He did that on purpose.

473
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,902
- I'd like to discuss tomorrow's meeting.
- Okay.

474
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,821
- I was thinking that we should relocate.
- Midtown?

475
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,406
- Here.
- Your house?

476
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,451
It'll be more comfortable,
with infinitely better snacks.

477
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:50,370
- Yeah, that sounds great.
- Wonderful, I'll call the group.

478
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:54,458
Okay, then I guess I'll see you
tomorrow. Bye.

479
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,584
What did he want?

480
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,504
He wanted to move the location
of our meeting to his house...

481
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,588
and to cost you $5.

482
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:02,591
That's going well, Grandpa doing
that thing with you at school?

483
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,343
Yeah, I think he's having fun with it.

484
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,720
See? Did your brilliant mother
call it or what?

485
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,804
Yes, she did.

486
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,682
You're damn lucky to have
that woman in your life.

487
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,976
It's whispered in my ear every night.

488
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,562
You won't let me write it
in your underwear anymore.

489
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,648
Check the machine
so I can erase the messages.

490
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:18,815
Right.

491
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:26,198
Hi, it's me. It's 4:00.
Call me when you get home.

492
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,369
Hey, it's 4:30. I'm home. Call me.

493
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,831
4:45. Where are you? I'll try paging you.

494
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,501
5:30. Did you get my page?
Call with the answer.

495
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,919
They are not all from him.

496
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,129
I totally forgot
you were getting home at 6:00.

497
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,715
And yet, oddly, after remembering
that information...

498
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:47,427
It's 5:45 and I just thought
I'd see if you got home early.

499
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,263
That boy would make
a good drinking game.

500
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,265
This is crazy. Ten messages?

501
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:54,059
Plus the four I took
before I stopped answering the phone.

502
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,143
Right.

503
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,980
Honey, ease up on that love potion
you've been giving him...

504
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,108
or he's gonna start showing up
at David Letterman's house soon.

505
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,901
- What's the matter?
- 14 messages.

506
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,279
- Yeah, so, it's a little...
- It's a little too much.

507
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,947
You guys fighting or something?

508
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,198
What are you talking about?

509
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,367
Did something happen
to set off the phone craze?

510
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,828
No, everything's been fine.
Everything's been calm.

511
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,371
No more incidents. I don't get it.

512
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,708
If I had to guess, I would say he's
feeling insecure about something.

513
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,209
- Why?
- Rory.

514
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:23,046
But I spend every free moment with him.
I call him, I page him...

515
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,257
- You've been good.
- Nothing seems to be enough.

516
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,676
Nothing seems to make things
normal again.

517
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,802
Give it some time.

518
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,762
I just want things to be
the way they were.

519
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,472
Honey, relationships are hard.

520
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:36,852
Sometimes you go through a weird patch
and things get funky for a little while.

521
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,439
But just give it a chance. Ride it out.
Things will calm down again.

522
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,773
I hope so.

523
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,859
I'm gonna erase the messages.

524
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,572
Stop that. Stop making me laugh.

525
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,200
You are trying to kill me.

526
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:54,870
You're making me laugh myself to death
so you can get away with a crime.

527
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,623
- Your mind is evil.
- Your soul is empty.

528
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,083
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes, darling, thank you.

529
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,585
I'll be right back.

530
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,214
- Hello, Blue Eyes.
- Hi, Giselle. How was lunch?

531
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,091
- Champagne, caviar. The usual.
- Sure.

532
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:12,346
Then came mounds of pasta
with terrible things in it. It was perfect.

533
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,723
You seem to be having a wonderful time.

534
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,309
I am. I will miss him so much
when I go home.

535
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:20,938
But thank goodness, he will have
an extra five pounds to remember me by...

536
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:24,107
after eating all my pasta today,
that dirty, thieving boy.

537
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,069
- Michel ate pasta?
- Yes, Michel loves pasta.

538
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,279
- He eats it all the time.
- Not around us.

539
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:31,406
Here it's all no-carb, low-cal.

540
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,909
'Let me see if I can eat
less than the lab rats do. '

541
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,869
- Lab rats?
- Better not explained.

542
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:39,248
Anyway, I'm glad you got him
eating pasta. He seems really happy.

543
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,624
Coffee.

544
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:46,296
- This is horrible.
- You will drink it and like it.

545
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,549
- You are a curse.
- Let's go shop.

546
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,843
Yes, let's go buy something
completely useless...

547
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:53,595
- and pay way too much money for it.
- I love it.

548
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,641
That is so wrong.

549
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,561
We should have waited for Paris.

550
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:03,564
She's the one who threw a fit
about leaving no later than 3:10.

551
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,233
She could be standing outside the school,
waiting for us.

552
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,902
- She has my cell number.
- I thought you lost your phone.

553
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,070
I did.

554
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,489
We'll call her when we get inside.

555
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,575
Tell her I wanted to wait, okay?

556
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,079
You're right on time. Come on in.

557
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:20,789
Okay.

558
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:23,083
In the dining room, everyone.

559
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:27,337
Welcome, everyone...

560
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:31,216
to the first official board meeting
of the Style Aid Corporation.

561
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,802
Will everyone please take a seat?

562
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,471
I feel like Ivan Boesky.

563
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:40,100
Rory, you are group leader, which
translates into chairman of the board...

564
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:42,186
which means
you sit at the head of the table.

565
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:45,355
- But that's where you sit.
- Not today. Come on.

566
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:49,860
At this point, I would like
to turn the meeting over to Paris...

567
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:52,988
who will bring us up to date
on our latest development. Paris.

568
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,364
Thank you, Richard.

569
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:57,367
First, let me say that I'm glad
to see you all here today...

570
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,996
at the beginning of what I think
is going to be a very exciting experiment.

571
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,415
Does she have the baseball bat
in her hands?

572
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:07,461
I'd like everyone to turn to Page 1
in your presentation booklets.

573
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,755
We haven't gotten to the pencil part yet.

574
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,381
Sorry.

575
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:14,593
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

576
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:17,846
the Rx 2002.

577
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,890
- Nice.
- Very nice.

578
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:23,936
Listed in front of you are all the contents
contained in the Rx 2002...

579
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,480
plus the additional style options, 12 in all.

580
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:30,484
Every one of them waterproof, fireproof,
and comes with a five-year warranty.

581
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,570
Which is longer than
most of your high-school careers.

582
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,322
He is funny.

583
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,826
There's also a deluxe model
with extra features...

584
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,704
designed to personalize your kit
even more specifically for your needs.

585
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:46,291
There will be a snap-in CD case
which can hold up to 10 CDs.

586
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,876
There's a lighted vanity mirror...

587
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,921
and a divided compartment
for makeup and knickknacks...

588
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:54,049
a picture frame,
and a hidden mini-vault for valuables...

589
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,843
which can be locked for safety.

590
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:59,137
- Terrific idea, Richard, really. Top-notch.
- Thank you, Paris.

591
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,473
This is really amazing. I want one of these.

592
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:05,185
Exactly the point. Let's check in
with our marketing department.

593
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,271
Madeline, Louise,
what have you got for us?

594
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,566
Okay, first, we go for the obvious.
Magazines.

595
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,068
You know, Teen, Young Miss, Seventeen.

596
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,988
Spin and Rolling Stone,
especially to hit the guys.

597
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,991
I hear that Jane magazine
also has a young, hip following.

598
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,951
How do you know about Jane magazine?

599
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,494
I have my ways, young lady.

600
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,830
We should also place them
in certain mall stores.

601
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,832
I think we should go
straight to the source.

602
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,083
- The schools?
- Why not?

603
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,918
School bulletin-boards. Websites.

604
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:32,921
You can set up tables at football games
and pep rallies.

605
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,799
- How is everyone doing here?
- Just fine, Emily.

606
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,926
Good. Is there enough food?

607
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,511
Yes, there is plenty of food.

608
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,513
What about ice cream?
Would anyone like...

609
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:44,766
Emily, we're in the middle
of a business meeting.

610
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:49,146
I'm very sorry.
Go back to your business meeting.

611
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,565
I think your projections...

612
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,275
- He's smiling.
- I know!

613
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,485
He's smiling,
and there's no oil on the carpet.

614
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:56,862
- Life is good.
- Yes, it is.

615
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,864
Emily, please.

616
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,782
I'm going.

617
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,076
Richard, do you have
the third-year projections?

618
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,954
Yes, Paris, I do. I have them right here.

619
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,344
Dean. How's it going?

620
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:23,722
- Just washing Rory's car.
- I can see that.

621
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,225
I came by to see her and she wasn't here...

622
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:28,060
so I was just gonna wait on the porch...

623
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,104
but then I noticed her car looked dirty,
I thought I'd wash it.

624
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:34,441
Sometimes things can get on your car.
Like dirt, certain kinds of sap.

625
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:37,027
They get into your paint.
It's really hard to get off.

626
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,905
Even water spots.
After it rains, they can be a real problem.

627
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,115
- Okay. Would you like a soda?
- No, I'm fine.

628
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:45,410
Put the squirting-water thing down
and come in the kitchen.

629
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:48,664
Squirting thing down. That's it. Come on.

630
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,504
I really didn't mean to bother you.
I can wait outside until Rory gets home.

631
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:58,423
Honey, Rory's working
on her school project today.

632
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:03,762
Yeah. I guess I forgot.
I mean, she must have told me that she...

633
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,849
- I'm sorry. I forgot.
- That's okay.

634
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,727
- I'll just go.
- No, come here. Sit down for a sec.

635
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,568
Are you all right?

636
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:21,280
Yeah, fine, I just don't remember Rory
telling me about her studying today.

637
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,115
I swear I wouldn't have come over.

638
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,242
Can I maybe give you a little advice?

639
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,035
- Sure.
- Okay.

640
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:31,248
First, I just want to tell you
I think you are a great guy.

641
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,041
You're so good to Rory.

642
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,752
Even though I hoped
she'd be the one girl in the world...

643
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:39,548
who wouldn't look at a boy until
she was 38, I'm really glad she found you.

644
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,674
Thanks.

645
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,760
I know things have been
a little off between you two lately.

646
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:45,929
- Did she say that?
- No. I'm saying that.

647
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:49,057
I can see it. And, by the way, I get it.

648
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:53,812
Sometimes when things are out of whack,
it freaks us out a little...

649
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:57,608
and makes us feel like we're
losing something that's really important...

650
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:58,984
and that scares us even more...

651
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,945
so we try to hold on
to whatever it is we think we're losing.

652
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:05,991
And sometimes we hold on
a little too hard.

653
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,201
Too hard?

654
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:11,079
Like 'calling 10 times
in a three-hour period' too hard.

655
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:12,331
Fourteen times.

656
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,876
Okay, see, I was gonna let you slide,
but an honest man, I like that.

657
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,836
You think I'm holding on too hard to Rory?

658
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,213
I don't think you mean to.

659
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,674
- You think I'm losing her?
- I think you think you are.

660
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:25,177
I just feel like nothing I do is...

661
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:28,013
I just want things back
the way they used to be.

662
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:31,391
- I know you do. And they can be.
- How?

663
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:34,186
I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes...

664
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:38,649
giving people a little bit of space
is actually the best thing to do.

665
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,526
- Space?
- Just a little.

666
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,736
Like what? Don't call her? Don't see her?

667
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:46,698
No. Just let her breathe. Let her relax.

668
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,076
Let her come to you for a change.

669
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,703
You're not telling me this
to get rid of me, are you?

670
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:53,872
Please! If I was trying to get rid of you...

671
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,708
I would've started with,
'Let me tell you about my family. '

672
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,294
I'm not telling you this to get rid of you.

673
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:03,340
I'm telling you because I think
it might help things between you guys.

674
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,842
Just try it.

675
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:08,470
If it doesn't work, I promise,
you can wash my car, too.

676
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,680
Okay.

677
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:13,559
- Do you want a soda?
- No, thanks. I'm gonna go.

678
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,940
Don't tell Rory I was here, okay?

679
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,819
I'm just sitting here at the table,
talking to myself. Again.

680
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,988
- Thanks.
- Bye, Dean.

681
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,455
You know what? Forget it!
If that's how you run your business...

682
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:37,749
I deserve this
for picking you in the first place!

683
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,126
I hate you!

684
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,713
Okay, new plan for the invites.

685
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:46,341
We're getting married May 15,
4:00, front lawn. Pass it on.

686
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:49,845
That's it. Word of mouth.
They used it for the Revolutionary War.

687
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:52,556
Who the hell am I to poo-poo history,
I ask you?

688
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,433
What the hell is wrong with you?

689
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,768
- With me?
- Yes, you. Are you out of your mind?

690
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,936
What are you talking about?

691
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,273
Why in God's name would you
tell my mother that I do not eat carbs?

692
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:04,610
- Because you don't.
- That is private information about me.

693
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:07,362
Everybody in Stars Hollow knows
you don't eat carbs.

694
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,573
- So what?
- Calm down. Have some toast.

695
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:12,534
Do not talk to my mother ever again.
Do you understand me?

696
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:15,954
I don't understand. You and your mother
seem crazy about each other.

697
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:18,749
I assumed, since you gave up carbs
a year ago, she knew.

698
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,417
You know what happens
when you assume.

699
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:21,502
What?

700
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:24,463
Something about a donkey.
It's a stupid American phrase!

701
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:27,591
You and your mother
seem to have the perfect relationship.

702
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:31,261
Yes. Because I tell her nothing.
We keep all subjects light and fluffy.

703
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:35,432
We talk about clothes, food, Posh Spice
and David Beckham, and that is all.

704
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,476
Nothing of value. Nothing of substance.

705
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:38,560
I'm sorry.

706
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,854
Now she knows
I've been hiding something from her.

707
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,314
Suddenly she's asking questions.

708
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:44,733
Why did I leave France at 18?
Where do I go at night?

709
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,402
Who are my friends? What do they do?
Where do they live?

710
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,280
Why have I chosen this career?
On and on. It never ends.

711
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:53,242
I can't stand it.
She's a complete pain. She won't stop.

712
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:57,287
I took a six-hour bath last night
just to escape the incessant nagging.

713
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:59,414
You did this to me!

714
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:02,835
You turned my Giselle into a mother,
and I hate you for it!

715
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:05,045
I hate you very much!

716
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:10,092
So, feel better now?

717
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,844
Yeah, I do. Thanks.

718
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:17,015
I've swept the room,
and I have to tell you, all sad.

719
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,141
I think we're a lock.

720
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:20,519
I actually thought
the locker alarm was pretty good.

721
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:22,521
No one even looks
when a car alarm goes off.

722
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:24,773
How effective
is a locker alarm going to be?

723
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:27,317
Nope. I feel it. We are it.

724
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:28,777
What's the word?

725
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:31,905
Every single idea in this room
is completely worthless.

726
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,824
There's a lot of wasted cardboard in here.

727
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:35,742
- We are going to win.
- Yes, we are.

728
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:38,745
Okay, the two of you
need to take a timeout.

729
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,623
- Richard, hello.
- Hanlin, good to see you.

730
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:43,125
What are you doing here?

731
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:47,045
I'm actually advising Rory
on her business project. The Rx 2002.

732
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:50,048
- That's wonderful. You look great.
- I feel great.

733
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,385
- We don't see you at the club that much.
- I've been very busy lately.

734
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:56,430
- Did I hear correctly? Did you retire?
- Right before Christmas.

735
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:59,516
So it's true. Biddy and I couldn't
believe it when we heard that.

736
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,059
A man can't work forever.

737
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:04,104
No, that's true.
I just can't picture you retired.

738
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:06,773
It's been wonderful lately.
Best move I've ever made.

739
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:08,734
It's given me time to do wonderful things.

740
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,361
That does sound nice.
What kinds of things are you doing?

741
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,863
Well, this.

742
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,865
There you go!

743
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:18,535
Unfortunately, some of us
aren't living the good life quite yet.

744
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:20,996
I've got to get back.
It's been wonderful seeing you.

745
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,540
- Let's have dinner soon.
- I would like that very much.

746
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:26,668
- I'll have Biddy give Em a call.
- You do that.

747
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:30,464
Did you see the hose-hook idea
over at Table 5?

748
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,549
A hook on your belt for your garden hose.

749
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,843
There's a Buster Keaton routine
waiting to happen.

750
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:36,261
How are we doing?

751
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:39,348
Paris is practicing spiking the football
and doing a back flip.

752
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:42,893
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
All the projects have now been reviewed.

753
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,061
Here we go.

754
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:47,898
Before we announce the winner, I must
commend everyone for their fine work.

755
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,568
There are many good ideas here today.
It makes me proud.

756
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,070
Move it along, padre.

757
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:55,489
Now I'd like to announce the winner.

758
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:58,951
Table 10. Miss Chester's class
with the locker alarm.

759
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,078
I don't understand. How's that possible?

760
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:04,540
This is so lame. That alarm
doesn't even work. I was just over there.

761
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:05,916
This is ludicrous.

762
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,460
- Grandpa, it doesn't matter.
- It certainly does matter.

763
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:12,422
You've put in an extraordinary amount
of time and effort and thought into this.

764
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:14,091
- It deserved to win.
- Yeah.

765
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,968
I wanted to win, too, but we didn't.

766
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:18,804
- I'm going to talk to the headmaster.
- I wish you wouldn't.

767
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:23,517
You were robbed, Rory, and I'm not gonna
sit back and simply watch it happen.

768
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:26,937
Hanlin, good. I want a word with you.

769
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,065
- Is something wrong?
- This contest is a disgrace!

770
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:31,275
I beg your pardon?

771
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,861
I've been in the business world
for 35 years.

772
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:37,614
And in those 35 years,
I've seen ideas come and go.

773
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:40,993
And I've learned a few things
about what flies and what doesn't.

774
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,870
- I'm sure you have.
- I am telling you...

775
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,705
that out there, in the real world...

776
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,041
there is no way that a locker alarm
that doesn't even work properly...

777
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,877
would be a viable business investment.

778
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,504
We're not in the real world.
We are in a school.

779
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:55,424
A school that should be
training children for the real world.

780
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:57,634
- Calm down.
- I demand a recount!

781
00:36:57,718 --> 00:37:01,513
Very well. I just recounted.
The alarm still wins.

782
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:04,975
Your project was very good.
It was definitely in the running.

783
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,226
You should be proud.

784
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,688
This is not my project!
This is their project. The children's project.

785
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:10,898
- Really?
- Yes!

786
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,567
This has nothing to do with me!
It's for the children!

787
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,905
But they're not the ones causing
the public scene right now. You are.

788
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,916
It was awful. He looked so upset.

789
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:31,543
His face was turning red
and he was practically shaking.

790
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,712
Did you notice
when he gets mad he gets taller?

791
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,506
I don't know how but he actually grows!

792
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:38,675
The day I told him I was pregnant,
24 feet tall. Freaked the birds.

793
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,094
- I'm upset here.
- Honey, you did nothing.

794
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,639
You went to your grandfather
who you greatly admire...

795
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:46,850
and actually like hanging out with,
to ask for his help and advice.

796
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,185
That's lovely and thoughtful.

797
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:49,520
Please help me out tonight.

798
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,689
No mention of work, or Chilton,
or school, or retirement.

799
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:55,359
Nothing but politics and religion. Got it.

800
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:56,860
- Hello, girls.
- Hi, Mom.

801
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:58,779
- Hi, Grandma.
- Come in.

802
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:04,743
Dinner's almost ready.
Richard, the girls are here.

803
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,164
He came home today, didn't say a word...

804
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:11,208
stomped off to his study,
slammed the door.

805
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,001
He's been holed up in there ever since.

806
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,503
I can't even get him to answer me.

807
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,588
- Are you sure he's still in there?
- Of course.

808
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:19,216
The door's right there.
I would have seen if he came out.

809
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,759
Not everyone leaves this house...

810
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:23,720
by climbing out the window
and jumping into a waiting hot rod.

811
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:26,265
- Someone should talk to him.
- I don't know what to do.

812
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,393
- What happened today?
- Things didn't go well at the business fair.

813
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,811
- What happened?
- It was terrible.

814
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:33,772
The 10th graders staged
a hostile takeover of the 11th graders.

815
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,816
Our project didn't win.
Grandpa took it badly.

816
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:39,862
I am at my wit's end. If that man is
going to fall apart over a school project...

817
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:42,698
- It's a weird time for him.
- I feel awful.

818
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:45,242
- Maybe he should go talk to somebody.
- Like whom?

819
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:47,119
Like a psychiatrist.

820
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:48,912
- What?
- Maybe it would help.

821
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:50,956
We do not go to psychiatrists.

822
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,250
Mom, there's nothing wrong
with getting help.

823
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:56,128
Lorelai Gilmore,
are you seriously suggesting...

824
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:59,798
that your father go to a complete stranger
and talk about his personal life?

825
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:01,216
Lots of people swear by it.

826
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,927
Yes. Disturbed people. Deviants.

827
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:08,140
People with multiple personalities
who see things and hear dogs talking...

828
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:12,019
and roam the streets talking
to themselves and licking parking meters.

829
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:15,981
Next thing you know,
you'll be suggesting I go to a psychiatrist.

830
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,150
Too many comebacks. I cannot pick.

831
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:21,153
- Richard? Is that you?
- Of course it's me.

832
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:24,490
Rory, you're here. Wonderful!
Hello, Lorelai.

833
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,992
I am starving. What's for dinner?

834
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:30,412
What's for dinner?
What do you mean, what's for dinner?

835
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:34,625
I thought the question was relatively clear,
but I'd be glad to rephrase it for you.

836
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:38,712
What sort of food products
will appear on various plates this evening?

837
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:42,674
You come home in a huff, then you
lock yourself in that study all afternoon...

838
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:45,969
I had a lot of thinking to do.
A lot of thinking.

839
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:48,680
- I owe that to you, young lady.
- I'm sorry.

840
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:51,600
- You should certainly not be sorry.
- Richard, what...

841
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,394
Put that roll down and explain yourself.

842
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:58,482
This whole week,
this whole experience with Rory...

843
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:02,194
and the locker first-aid kit...
That is a damn good idea, by the way...

844
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,239
no matter what those yarn-heads
at that school of yours say.

845
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:08,534
Anyway, this whole week
made me realize something:

846
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,036
I don't want to be retired.

847
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,205
- You what?
- I don't like it.

848
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:16,041
- I hate it, as a matter of fact.
- But, Dad...

849
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:19,670
It's boring. I have absolutely no idea
what to do with myself.

850
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:23,507
Frankly, I am tired of trying
to find something to fill up my time.

851
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,884
- So what are you going to do?
- I'm going to work.

852
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,720
- Are you asking for your job back?
- God, no.

853
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:33,058
No, I have decided
to go into business for myself.

854
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,351
- Wow.
- What?

855
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,228
- Cool.
- It is cool, isn't it?

856
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,064
- What are you going to do?
- I'm not sure yet.

857
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:41,900
Perhaps I'll consult,
maybe take on a partner.

858
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,777
- Maybe I'll even teach.
- What?

859
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:47,072
- You don't have to say it like that.
- Sorry. What?

860
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:50,993
I think 35 years of experience
will qualify me...

861
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:54,204
to teach a course or two
at that local business college of yours.

862
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:56,957
My God.
It's Who's The Boss? The Later Years.

863
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,419
- Richard, are you serious about this?
- As a heart attack.

864
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,422
I haven't felt this good
in a very long time, Emily.

865
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:05,132
I have the buzz.

866
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:09,094
- And I owe it all to you.
- Glad to be of service.

867
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:10,387
He's going to teach.

868
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,181
Or consult.

869
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:15,726
So, licking a parking meter
is just around the corner.

870
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:21,231
- Okay, that dinner was good.
- All of Grandma's dinners are good.

871
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:24,401
- I know, but this one had the rolls.
- Those were excellent rolls.

872
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:27,571
Weren't they?
Hot and buttery with that split-top thing.

873
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:30,324
- I miss the rolls.
- She can make more next week.

874
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,993
- That's okay. I got four in my purse.
- You do not.

875
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:34,786
Go ahead and check.

876
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,247
Have you no shame?

877
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:39,041
Who's that?

878
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,877
It's Dean.

879
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,254
Really? How many pages
does that make for today?

880
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:45,464
Just one.

881
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,174
- You're kidding.
- In two days.

882
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,009
- Wow.
- I know.

883
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:52,346
He hasn't called or mysteriously
appeared by my side or anything.

884
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,598
- Maybe he's calming down.
- I hope so.

885
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,683
I actually got a chance to miss him today.

886
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:58,977
- That sounds good.
- It is good.

887
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:01,021
You want to grab my cell phone
and call him?

888
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,356
No. Tomorrow's fine.

889
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,734
Are you sure? It's early.
You guys could hook up for a little while.

890
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:07,778
- I'm hanging out with Lane tonight.
- Lane?

891
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:10,823
Yeah. We have some serious
CD listening to do.

892
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:13,450
We're way behind
on all the Elvis Costello reissues.

893
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:15,452
I didn't think
Lane could hang out past 9:00.

894
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,996
Her mom's at an antique fair in Woodbury
until Sunday.

895
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,916
Her grandmother's staying with her,
but she's asleep by 6:00.

896
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:23,627
So we thought we'd be really bad
and sneak out to Luke's.

897
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,963
- You're going to Luke's?
- Maybe.

898
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:29,341
Why go to Luke's?
I mean, you just had 10 rolls.

899
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:32,886
No, you did, and I don't even know
if we'll go. It's just a maybe.

900
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,972
Okay, you guys have fun.

901
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,900
Okay. See you later.

902
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:50,571
- Sure you don't want to call Dean?
- Nope. Tomorrow's fine.

903
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,531
Yeah. Tomorrow's fine.

904
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,357
She likes Jess, doesn't she?
