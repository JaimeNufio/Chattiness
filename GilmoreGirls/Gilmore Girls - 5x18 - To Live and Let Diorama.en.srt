1
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:09,878
Ugh, raisins. What are the pruney red things?

2
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:11,031
Dried cranberries

3
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:12,447
Gone. What's this?

4
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:13,187
Carob

5
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:14,245
Adios.

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,747
Okay, why do we buy trail mix if you're going to pick everything out?

7
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,053
Well, they've ruined trail mix. Used to be simple. Now they put too much stuff in it.

8
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:21,945
Your mouth doesn't know what to expect with any given bite.

9
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:23,600
Will it be fruity? Will it be granola-y?

10
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,701
Will it be chocolate substitute-y? What's this?

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,800
Soybean.

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,170
Bah, squirrel food!

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,150
Ladies, please. We're saying good-bye to Mr. Twickham.

14
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:31,594
So?

15
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:34,000
The man's on his deathbed. Show a little respect.

16
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,429
Taylor, Old Man Twickham's been dying for twenty years.

17
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,856
This is my seventeenth time saying adios.

18
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:40,499
Yeah, I think you have the record, Patty.

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,839
I forget, when was the last time we thought he was dying?

20
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,342
It's been a good two years.

21
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,807
I remember now. The last time - the rain?

22
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:47,990
We got drenched.

23
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,809
Made the whole "he's dying" thing a total bummer.

24
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,514
Ladies, please!

25
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:54,514
You may not be respecting this moment but all the rest of us are.

26
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,615
Get your Twickham souvenirs here! Twickham souvenirs!

27
00:00:57,714 --> 00:00:58,611
I've got your bats!

28
00:00:58,636 --> 00:00:59,619
I've got your balls!

29
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:01,381
I've got your foam fingers!

30
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:02,912
Get 'em before he's
gone!

31
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,170
Oh, how's Mr. Twickham looking, Andrew?

32
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,017
A little tired.

33
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:07,296
Well, dying is exhausting.

34
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:09,501
Yeah, he's thinking of taking a break and picking up again tomorrow.

35
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:10,348
Ugh, no.

36
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,605
We've been waiting for an hour.

37
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:15,775
He's kind of distracted anyway. The whole time I was there he was Tivo-ing through a fresh Summerland.

38
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:17,630
Do we have time to come back tomorrow?

39
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:18,577
Uh, no. Not really

40
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:19,461
Hey, everybody? Um,

41
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:20,519
keep it quick in there, okay?

42
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:23,220
"Good morning, Mr. Twickham. Good-bye Mr. Twickham. " And then vamoose.

43
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,120
He should really start dying earlier in the day.

44
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:26,637
Yeah.

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,977
Ugh, green stuff? Come on!

46
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,085
What's green?

47
00:01:30,595 --> 00:02:21,506
"To live and let diorama"

48
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,415
Hello?

49
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:34,274
He's dead.

50
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:34,989
Who?

51
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:35,873
Old Man Twickham.

52
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:36,487
No!

53
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:37,059
Yes!

54
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:38,068
It's got to be a mistake.

55
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,649
It's not. The man is gone.

56
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,130
I don't believe it. I mean, are you sure?

57
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,720
There's no breath left in him.

58
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,201
The light's gone out of his eyes.

59
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,525
He smelled the burnt almonds. He's feeding the worms. He's chatting up his grandpa.

60
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,526
He is the old man formerly known as Twickham.

61
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:50,223
Wow.

62
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,372
I can't believe he's gone. I mean, he's been dying my whole life.

63
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:57,183
And I just got my good-bye in. He was about to close shop for the day

64
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,474
we got in, told him good-bye and that we'd miss him,

65
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:02,598
we left and then apparently he just closed his eyes.

66
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:05,226
Muttered something about Lori
Loughlin and that was that.

67
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,910
Wow.

68
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:06,343
Yeah.

69
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:07,762
He's never died before.

70
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,666
I guess there's a first time for everything.

71
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,405
Kirk's happy, though. His dying caused a run on souvenirs.

72
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:13,251
Tacky

73
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:14,210
Oh, yeah. Tacky.

74
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,828
So, are you coming home this weekend?

75
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,182
Probably not. Maybe next week.

76
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:18,925
Okay. I just always like to check.

77
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,207
So, I should go.

78
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,441
Sorry about Old Man Twickham.

79
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,300
Got to move on.

80
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:24,727
I hear Old Man Ketchum has a nasty cough. Could
turn into some

81
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:25,586
That's the spirit.

82
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:26,657
Bye.

83
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,637
Pathetic!

84
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:32,670
What?

85
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,931
Nothing important, I just wanted to inform you that you're pathetic!

86
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:36,871
Back at you, sister.

87
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:38,402
I am not pathetic.

88
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,361
Oh, come on.

89
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,576
We're in the same situation, except you're in denial.

90
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,585
denial!

91
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:43,988
I haven't seen Logan lately.

92
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:46,241
Well, why don't you call him up, then? Bet he misses you.

93
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:47,249
Is he missing you?

94
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:47,797
Good-bye.

95
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:49,590
Have fun pretending the sky is green.

96
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:51,729
Yeah, have fun re-enacting the Maxell tape ad.

97
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:02,052
Hey Soph.

98
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:03,484
You wash your hands?

99
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,168
Front and back.

100
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:05,139
Let's see 'em.

101
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:08,513
So we're never going to forget the peanut butter on the sitar?

102
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,881
Good God, man, have you heard of hand cream?

103
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,374
Okay if we walk around?

104
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:13,408
Carefully.

105
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,391
Hi, Lane.

106
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,175
Hi, Sophie.

107
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:17,005
Show her the thing.

108
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,824
Something like that's very self-conscious.

109
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:19,596
It's why you brought it.

110
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:20,057
I know.

111
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:20,816
So, show her.

112
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,302
So, Sophie Bloom.

113
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,692
Your last name's Bloom.

114
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:27,427
Thanks for the info.

115
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:29,630
I was looking through some old vinyl I have.

116
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:33,432
I don't have much, because I was born right on the cusp of the CD revolution.

117
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:36,404
But I originally had a record player. A Snoopy record player. Boy,

118
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,752
I love this record player. And shutting my door and listening to music on it

119
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:44,040
Oh, my God, Garrison Keillor, what is your point?

120
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:51,161
I saw the name "Sophie Bloom" on this album - the one non-Christian one my mother allowed me to have.

121
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,791
It just popped out at me and I was wondering -

122
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:55,556
Oh, this thing.

123
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:58,797
So, it's you. You wrote these songs.

124
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:59,756
Long time ago.

125
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:01,648
I think this is amazing!

126
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,699
Because I want to do more than just drum. I would like to...

127
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:09,703
write and compose and I was wondering if we could sit down sometime and just talk about music, because I think...

128
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,741
you have so much you can pass on to me.

129
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,878
Woman to woman. Really, just coffee sometime. My
treat.

130
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:18,930
Well, I suppose sometime when I'm not working or out of town,

131
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:24,320
if my boyfriend's busy and my laundry's done, and I'm not sick and there's nothing on TV,

132
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:27,541
we could maybe meet up for a couple of minutes.

133
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,362
It's a date.

134
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,024
Hey, there she is, the woman of the hour!

135
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:39,258
Apparently that's me.

136
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,864
I am blown away by this!

137
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,806
Yeah, well, my hugs are that powerful.

138
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:47,050
Well, well, I'm talking about the article. You're going to be on the cover of a magazine! That's a big deal!

139
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,379
Well, it's the inn, it's not me, but yes, it is a big deal!

140
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:52,093
So, how'd they tell you? They phone you, or they, you know, they e-mail you?

141
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,230
They just said they were so impressed by the inn, they were so impressed by my story-

142
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:56,414
It's a great story.

143
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:59,676
Well, it's a little thin, when you compare it to War and Peace, but -

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,260
What? You started with nothing. It's a great story. The magazine's pretty good, too. I did some research.

145
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,020
Oh. Research?

146
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,020
Yeah, I got a bunch of back issues and I read them. I tried to figure out who should interview you.

147
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:13,876
Okay. Alicia Kensington. Staff writer, too green and way too stiff.

148
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:16,502
Too many adverbs. Frederick Fairmount.

149
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,098
Pff, he talks more about himself than the person he's interviewing. Something boozy about him, too.

150
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:22,957
I don't think they let you pick who's going to interview you

151
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,368
Well, just in case they offer. But this is big.

152
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:27,600
Yeah, I guess it is.

153
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:29,532
What happened there?

154
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:31,274
Eh, what do you think? Taylor.

155
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:33,432
How did Taylor break the window?

156
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:35,075
How do you think? By being Taylor.

157
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,017
Taylor's Taylor-ness can now break glass?

158
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:37,848
You know what I mean.

159
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,283
He's doing something, and crash, bang, there you go. Hey, is it, uh, six yet?

160
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:42,409
Uh, a little past.

161
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:44,650
Ah, shoot. Town meeting's started.

162
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:45,247
So?

163
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:47,389
So I thought we'd go. I mean, you like those things, right?

164
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:48,933
Uh, yeah, but you don't.

165
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,173
Yes, but, this is your big night, you know,

166
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:55,303
with the article and everything. Look, why don't we hit the town meeting and then we'll go get something to eat, like a little celebration?

167
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,224
Oh, sounds good!

168
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:57,942
Yeah, great! Let's go, we got to, we got to hurry.

169
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:58,489
Okay.

170
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,690
Come on, people! It’s not that complicated.

171
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:03,773
I don’t want to be a burden.

172
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:07,022
Patty? What about that couch you have at the back or your studio?

173
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:10,607
In her freezing cold studio with no insulation and no heat.

174
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:11,223
Sounds great.

175
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:11,384
Hi.

176
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,227
Hi, what’s happening?

177
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:14,755
Problems with Kirk’s schedule.

178
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:18,498
Ah. Can’t Sheriff Taylor just let him share a cell with Otis for the night?

179
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:21,050
Well, maybe the Morris’ will take him again.

180
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:23,204
Their kids stuck things in my nose.

181
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,034
Well, then, lock the door when you sleep!

182
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,578
It wasn’t while I was asleep.

183
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,097
Hey. How’d you drag Luke here?

184
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,204
He wanted to come.

185
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,570
I’ll just sleep outside in the gazebo.

186
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,683
I would ask, though, that if I die from exposure,

187
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,003
don’t just dump me in the landfill.

188
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:38,405
No one’s dumping you in a landfill, Kirk.

189
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:39,914
It’s against regulations.

190
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,602
Let’s pigeonhole this matter for now,

191
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:45,167
people. Get on to our next order of business.

192
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:48,275
It’s the matter of the estate of the late Joshua Twickham.
As you know -

193
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,159
You bring food?

194
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,306
After the trail mix fiasco, I wouldn’t dare.

195
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:53,360
Sorry.

196
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:54,733
I am happy to say

197
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:58,480
that this beloved elder was generous even on his deathbed.

198
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:02,514
Mr. Twickham has left his beautiful home to the town.

199
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:05,252
Is his deathbed still there? I’m not picky.

200
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,897
What does that mean, to the town?

201
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,116
Luke! What are you doing here?

202
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:09,723
Just keep going, Taylor.

203
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:13,616
He left the house to the Historical Society

204
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:17,413
along with his ample collection of valuable memorabilia.

205
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:21,301
His will stipulates that the house is to be converted into a museum.

206
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,517
A museum?

207
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,434
Are you going to interrupt me the whole meeting?

208
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:25,667
I’m just asking.

209
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,208
A Stars Hollow museum.

210
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:31,805
We will display his personal historical artifacts for a period of two months.

211
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:37,013
After two months, the house is to be disposed of at the discretion of the head of the Historical Society,

212
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,961
he
meaning me.

213
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:38,982
Oh, goody.

214
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:40,687
So now you’re going to talk under your breath.

215
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:41,546
I’m sorry.

216
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:45,430
Funny, I didn’t hear those words come out of your mouth this morning after you tried to kill me.

217
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:45,952
What?

218
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:51,124
So, we’re going to need strong volunteers to make this dream a reality.

219
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,622
Now, anyone with appropriate skills, let’s see a show of hands.

220
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:57,697
Uh, you’re really going to have to fill me in on the gag, here.

221
00:08:57,728 --> 00:09:01,076
Luke, don’t come to these things just to mock our business.

222
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:03,056
I’m not mocking anything, I’m volunteering.

223
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:05,209
After you threw a frying pan at my head.

224
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,728
You threw a frying pan at Taylor’s head?

225
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:08,306
Just for playing my Muzak

226
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:11,430
too loud. I mean, who doesn’t love Muzak?

227
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,061
Oh! Music lovers?

228
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,153
The thing slipped out of my hand.

229
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,120
Right after you said, quote, um,

230
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:20,493
you better duck, Taylor, because I’m going to throw this frying pan at your head”??

231
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:23,333
You threw a frying pan at Taylor’s head without me there? I hate you.

232
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:25,424
I’m volunteering. Take it or leave it.

233
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:29,246
Patty, take down the names of the legitimate volunteers, please.

234
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:33,356
Now, whoever’s actually going to show up, our day starts at seven sharp.

235
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,733
To the rest, shame on you.

236
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:40,635
Now, onto item number three. The budgetary concerns about the new snowplow.

237
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:43,934
I’m sorry, does Taylor have compromising pictures of you or something?

238
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:44,669
It’s no joke.

239
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,208
Why on earth are you volunteering for Taylor?

240
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,963
Well, um -

241
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,387
Luke.

242
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:52,065
How well did you know Old Man Twickham?

243
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:52,849
Somewhat.

244
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:57,928
Well, I knew him all my life. He was like another dad, in a way.

245
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:59,074
Oh. Nice.

246
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:02,559
And I didn’t show up to say good-bye, and I’m feeling a little guilty about it,

247
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:05,186
you know. He’s a good guy. I just want to do right by him.

248
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:08,374
Well. You are a terrific fellow, Luke Danes.

249
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:09,445
No, Kirk.

250
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:13,740
If you build an igloo to sleep in, and the town plow runs over it, it kills you,

251
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,691
we are not going to just leave your corpse in the snow.

252
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,392
Okay, but I don’t want to be a burden.

253
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,372
Let’s store all the boxes inside. Sort through them in there, then store what we don’t need in the garage.

254
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:27,206
Morning, Taylor.

255
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:28,976
What are you doing here?

256
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:30,158
I volunteered.

257
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,702
I don’t get the joke.

258
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,054
There’s no joke! I’m at your disposal.

259
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:39,221
Now, we’re going to need a nice flat staging area, perhaps over there, because there’s no space here out front.

260
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:40,267
What about right here?

261
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:41,524
My office is going here.

262
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,018
Your office? Why do you need an office?

263
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:44,165
So you came to complain?

264
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,024
No, I was just -

265
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,978
I’m organizing! I’m working! I need an office!

266
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:48,372
Okay, fine. Sorry. Carry on.

267
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,689
Come on, everybody! Let’s hook up with people inside and I’ll start handing out assignments.

268
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:54,979
Eh, where are you going?

269
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:55,676
Inside

270
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:56,424
Why?

271
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:58,316
I’m a volunteer!

272
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:04,465
Hey, Luke.

273
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:05,127
Hey, Kyle.

274
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:06,160
Just thought I’d lend a hand.

275
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:06,969
Uh-huh, good one.

276
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:08,774
Is this everybody, people?

277
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,621
I believe so, Taylor.

278
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:10,903
What the hell are you doing here?

279
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:12,808
I can’t keep answering this question.

280
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,000
Come in, good folk.

281
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:18,822
We are embarking on a wonderful adventure.

282
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:23,848
Right here in this room, we will display Mr.
Twickham’s impressive collection of memorabilia.

283
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:28,986
Upstairs, we’ll house the multimedia dioramas depicting the history of the town.

284
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:29,832
Sounds good.

285
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:34,198
Now, I took the liberty of doing up some fun shirts that we all can wear.

286
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,841
Everyone, please. Put one on.

287
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:41,925
Isn’t that nice.

288
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:45,640
Now, they all take a cold water wash and tumble dry.

289
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:46,694
Low.

290
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:50,363
Now, before we begin, I’d like us all to join hands.

291
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:51,047
What?

292
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,185
He’s a twisted little perv if you ask me.

293
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:55,002
Come on, everybody, take hands.

294
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,027
Let’s close our eyes and visualize our goal.

295
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,291
Picture a freckle-faced
boy,

296
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:08,934
eyes wide with curiosity, drinking in the history of the town as he wanders the room.

297
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,209
He’s by the door,

298
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:12,923
he’s going by the stairs, he’s delighting -

299
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:13,658
Luke’s peeking.

300
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,649
That means you’re peeking too, snitch.

301
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:16,994
Quiet! Please!

302
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,645
Hey, I’ve lost track. Where’s the freckle-faced kid walking?

303
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:24,805
Okay, I think that’s enough visualizing, everybody. How about we start organizing all these boxes, okay?

304
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,506
I’d like a moment with you, Luke.

305
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:29,950
Yeah, time to let go, there, Taylor!

306
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:31,394
I want the straight skinny from you.

307
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:32,639
Really, let go of my hand.

308
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:34,316
Not until you tell me what you’re doing.

309
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:35,822
I’m really just trying to get my hand away from you.

310
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,814
Why are you here? Why did you volunteer?

311
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:38,946
Because I wanted to!

312
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:44,749
Luke, you hated Old Man Twickham. I know that for a fact. You said
despicable things about him your whole life!

313
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,862
Well, okay. If you must know, Lorelai asked me.

314
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:48,472
Lorelai?

315
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:49,493
That’s right.

316
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:51,883
You know, we’ve been through a bit of a rough patch -

317
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:52,617
Yes.

318
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:55,968
Well, I want to make things right with her. Get off to a good new start.

319
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:59,217
She really wants me to get involved with community things, so she asked me to get involved.

320
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:00,561
So, I’m doing it for her.

321
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,679
Well, I think that’s very nice.

322
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:05,878
So I’m here for you, Taylor. One hundred percent.

323
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,355
Good. Because you’re not untalented.

324
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,065
Thank you.

325
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:13,858
How about I make you my right-hand man? Stick by me! Be me when I’m not here! What do you say?

326
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:16,211
Well, I’ll need my right hand back for that, I think.

327
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:18,041
Of course.

328
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:26,246
Okay. Good. This is a new side of you, Luke, and I like it. All right, let’s get started, everybody!

329
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:29,339
Kirk, grab Kyle and come on over and help me start in this corner.

330
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,094
So, which is your favorite room?

331
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,771
Oh, that changes daily. Today it’s the library.

332
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,190
What do you love about it?

333
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:38,004
It - hugs you. You know - does that sound silly?

334
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,135
Not at all.

335
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:42,074
Um, the kitchen turned out so wonderfully. So

336
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:44,178
the kitchen and the library are duking it out right now.

337
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:45,946
I should definitely get the name of your designer.

338
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:47,389
Numerous. We went through quite a few.

339
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:49,163
Really? The design’s so cohesive.

340
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:50,943
What you see is a lot of me.

341
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,711
Uh, she said that so humbly.

342
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,314
Hey, credit where credit is due.

343
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:56,144
I put my soul into this place.

344
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:57,065
My heart.

345
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:59,206
My liver, a couple of kidneys.

346
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:01,720
I had a great partner in Sookie, and, uh,

347
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:03,646
we had a great community
rooting for us -

348
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:06,310
That’s what you feel here. Support, family,

349
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,906
homeyness, warmth. It must reflect your upbringing.

350
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,312
No?

351
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:14,607
I am just happy I wasn’t sipping coffee when you said that, it would have come out my nose.

352
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:17,367
Oh. Childhood wasn’t so warm and fuzzy?

353
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,501
You know Superman’s fortress of solitude?

354
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:22,286
A Jamaican beach, compared to my mother’s house.

355
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:25,361
So I’ll cross your mother off your list of inspirations.

356
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:28,834
No, I actually did pick up some valuable lessons on running a staff
from my mother.

357
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:29,531
How so?

358
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:32,569
Well, I consider what my mother would do in a given situation,

359
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:37,324
then I dial it back, and I have what Mussolini would do, then I dial it back, and I have what Stalin would do,

360
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:41,130
and then I dial that back and then it starts approaching what a sane person would do.

361
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:42,001
Ouch.

362
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:45,215
You’re right. Let’s find a topic happier than my relationship with my mother.

363
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,132
Basically that would be anything short of famine.

364
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:48,713
Okay.

365
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:53,086
I will tell you one story about my mother on a family vacation.

366
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,507
Jimmy Carter was there.

367
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,561
And he had a bigger room.

368
00:14:56,673 --> 00:14:59,586
All righty. Upstairs floors and walls cleaned,

369
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:00,429
check.

370
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:03,890
Blackout curtains delivered and ready to be installed,

371
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:04,612
check.

372
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:05,956
Uh, Luke?

373
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:06,554
Yeah.

374
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,908
It would really help to hear you say ‘check’.

375
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:10,688
Oh, I’m getting it, Taylor.

376
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:13,302
But how do I know that unless you say ‘check’ after I say ‘check’?

377
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:16,154
Fine.

378
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:19,789
And audio equipment delivered, awaiting mounting brackets,

379
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:20,536
check?

380
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:22,453
Check.

381
00:15:22,616 --> 00:15:23,799
Excellent.

382
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:27,185
Boys, boys, what’s so funny?

383
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:29,164
I took the mannequin by the arms and I said -

384
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:31,181
Wait, wait, I’ll tell him. He goes ‘grab the other end’ -

385
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,625
No, no, I said, ‘grab her end’ -

386
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:35,127
Right, so I grabbed her here.

387
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:36,172
Her rear end!

388
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:37,667
And I was walking with it like that!

389
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:41,796
Really, do I have to separate you two? Now set that down and bring in the others.

390
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,066
Modestly.

391
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,923
So, Gypsy. Find some interesting stuff?

392
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:53,015
How does a George Washington letter sound?

393
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,674
Fantastic.

394
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:54,882
Wow, that’s great!

395
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,132
Mint condition, too.

396
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:58,186
Let’s frame it, and hang it in a place of honor.

397
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:00,352
Eh, I’m not sure this is what you think it is.

398
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:03,738
What do you mean? It’s a letter to the editor, signed ‘George Washington’.

399
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:05,403
It’s dated ‘1944’.

400
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,324
That’s a little smudged, that could be 1744.

401
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:08,494
It mentions Jack Benny.

402
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,149
Well, we could cross out the Jack Benny part.

403
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:14,329
Let’s put it on the ‘to be displayed’ pile and we’ll authenticate it at a later date.

404
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,350
Actually, why don’t we put it in the ‘maybe’ pile,

405
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,043
Taylor? There’s got to be better than this.

406
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:21,206
You’re right! Let’s keep our standards high. Good thinking, Luke.

407
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:26,609
Now, Gypsy, as soon as we have everything catalogued, my man Luke here will liaise with you to co-ordinate your needs.

408
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:27,681
Right, we’ll liaise.

409
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:29,735
Fine. But I’m not doing nothing dirty.

410
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,544
Carry on.

411
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:35,498
Hey, so we should start moving this stuff in the other room so we can clean here next -

412
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:36,034
Luke.

413
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:36,943
Yeah?

414
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:38,661
Taylor would like to see you in his office.

415
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:40,192
What? He was just here.

416
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:41,288
That’s what he said.

417
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:43,317
I’ll be right back.

418
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:53,988
Come in.

419
00:16:58,246 --> 00:16:59,216
You wanted to see me?

420
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:02,465
Ah, Luke. Yes. Sit down, won’t you? We need to talk.

421
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:07,277
Now, if you’re going to disagree with me, which you have every right to, please don’t do it in front of the rest of the crew.

422
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:08,098
What are you talking about?

423
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,621
That George Washington letter. I was humiliated.

424
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:11,419
No you weren’t.

425
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:13,439
Luke, we’re a team. Don’t forget that.

426
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:16,900
Fine, okay. I won’t disagree with you in front of the crew.

427
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,560
Good.

428
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:21,408
Although, it’s probably safest for you not to disagree with me
at all, don’t you think?

429
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,375
Ah, sure. I agree.

430
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:24,047
Good.

431
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:24,943
Taylor!

432
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,059
This is Taylor Doose.

433
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:28,616
The carpenter is here, Taylor.

434
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,234
Copy that.

435
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:31,990
Uh, liaise with him, would you?

436
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:33,670
Mm-hm. You took the words right out of my mouth.

437
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:43,991
Where’s the guy, Kirk?

438
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:44,862
Right over there.

439
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,093
Every one of these people is dead.

440
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,201
That makes me sad.

441
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,566
That movie is from the sixties. They’re not all dead.

442
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:12,637
Well, they’re old.

443
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:16,073
Osteoporosistic. These days if they shake it, they
break it. That makes me sad.

444
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:17,118
Switch back to Moller.

445
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,948
Hey, it was your idea for me to watch a movie.

446
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:21,824
It was my idea for you to do whatever it took to get your mind off Doyle.

447
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:23,318
So, you’re going away, huh?

448
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:24,936
No Huntzberger this weekend?

449
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:25,820
Obviously not.

450
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:28,063
You guys were hot and heavy for a couple weeks. What happened?

451
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:28,710
Nothing.

452
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:30,440
Feast turned into famine, huh?

453
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:32,146
Fine. If you must know, yes.

454
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,880
See, Paris, I am not in denial. Logan and I were hot and heavy, had a good two weeks,

455
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,973
then it became about voicemails,
then crickets.

456
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:44,023
So, yes, he pulled back and I’m going crazy, but I’m not going to stay here and wallow and watch you be all depressed.

457
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:44,876
You’re right.

458
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:45,934
About what?

459
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:49,083
About staying here. You should get out, I should get out. This place is poison.

460
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:49,668
It is!

461
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:55,926
I don’t want to be like this. I want to live my life so that I’ll be able to read an in-depth biography about myself in later years, and not puke.

462
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:56,359
Good.

463
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:59,682
I’m going to get up and pack, and I am going to have some fun this weekend.

464
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:00,081
Good.

465
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:03,317
How does this end?

466
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:04,325
They dance again.

467
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:04,798
Okay.

468
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:08,347
Hey, Zach?

469
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:12,203
Grandy’s closes at eight tonight, a little early because it’s one of his kid’s birthdays,

470
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:13,423
but I checked with Luke

471
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,248
and he’s letting me
off at seven, so we’ve got plenty of time.

472
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:16,871
For what?

473
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:18,365
To shop at Grandy’s.

474
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:19,549
We set it up last week.

475
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:20,209
We did?

476
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:20,756
Yes.

477
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,366
Huh. Well, can we go next week?

478
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:28,737
Zach, we haven’t hit Grandy’s in four months. We’re completely out of cleaning supplies.

479
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:31,575
Well, I can’t go tonight, so just go without me.

480
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:33,990
But you love shopping for cleaning supplies.

481
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:36,152
I know, but tonight I’ve got something to do.

482
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:36,762
What?

483
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:39,352
I’m just going to go chill with some friends.

484
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:39,962
Who?

485
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,142
Well, okay, Officer, I confess. Body’s in the trunk.

486
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:43,490
Zach.

487
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,727
I’m just going to see some old friends. God, what do you want, names and addresses?

488
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,731
No. Fine. I’ll go by myself.

489
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,478
Good.

490
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:50,026
Good.

491
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:55,343
And don’t forget. Get a dishwashing liquid that’s gentle on my hands.

492
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:56,513
I will.

493
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:04,817
Hello!

494
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,422
Hi! Honey!

495
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:08,735
This is okay, right? Springing a surprise visit on you.

496
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:10,831
This is your definition of surprise?

497
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:14,590
This is not a
surprise. Come on in, I’ll show you a surprise.

498
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:16,364
Paris!

499
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:21,169
I packed my bags and was on the road before I remembered that parents don’t own property in the United States anymore.

500
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:21,704
Since when?

501
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:23,870
Since the IRS red-foxed my father.

502
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:30,145
The place in Asylum Hill, the Nantucket cottage - even the crack-house in
Harlem that we converted into a co-op was sold to one of the Queer Eye guys.

503
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:30,879
Where’d they go?

504
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,572
They’re going to wire me when they’re safe.

505
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:33,765
Anyway, I’m here.

506
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:34,748
Should
I leave?

507
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:35,744
No, stay.

508
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:36,840
Uh, if it’s okay with Mom.

509
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:37,898
It’s okay with me.

510
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,480
So I guess you can have the couch.

511
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:41,036
Ah, sorry. That’s spoken for.

512
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:41,372
What?

513
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,272
Hey, Rory. This is a nice surprise.

514
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,817
The Maddis’ were supposed to have him tonight. They have goldfish. Kirk’s afraid of goldfish.

515
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:51,593
They’re always staring at you. All gold and unblinking.

516
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:54,170
I like sleeping on the floor anyway. It’s good for my back.

517
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:54,905
Okay.

518
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,802
Enjoy.

519
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,383
Can I, um -

520
00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:58,453
Mm-hm.

521
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:02,325
How do you feel about goldfish?

522
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:04,156
So, what inspired your visit?

523
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:05,712
Just nothing else to do.

524
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:07,430
Ah, well, don’t I feel special.

525
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:08,961
Sorry. You know what I mean.

526
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,546
You mean, I love you mommy, I miss you mommy.

527
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:11,405
That’s what I meant.

528
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:15,415
So, no parties or anything? No dates?

529
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,714
No. Just a nice quiet weekend. It’s perfect.

530
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:19,872
Oh, wait,

531
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:23,010
you didn’t have
anything planned with Luke tonight? Don’t cancel it on my account.

532
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:24,379
No, it’s okay. He’s busy.

533
00:21:24,388 --> 00:21:29,554
Taylor’s making him drive out to fetch an historical cannonball that Old Man Twickham had lent to his sister in Mystic.

534
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,110
What would you borrow a cannonball for?

535
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:32,367
It’s been bugging me too.

536
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:34,318
Hm. So, how’d your magazine interview go?

537
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:38,140
Good, I think. I mean, I’ve never done one before. She didn’t stab me with her pencil or anything.

538
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:39,136
A very good thing.

539
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:44,717
My interviewer was really cool. Sandra. It was more like friends chatting than being interviewed.

540
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,569
She loved the inn, and she asked some good questions, and she loved, loved my Emily stuff.

541
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,604
Your Emily stuff?

542
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:53,384
Yeah, she asked me questions about my background.

543
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:55,115
I gave it to her,
unplugged.

544
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:55,762
You didn’t.

545
00:21:55,824 --> 00:21:56,571
She asked.

546
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:57,916
But you couched it, right?

547
00:21:57,978 --> 00:21:58,489
What do you mean?

548
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:02,335
I mean, you described it in so many words, colorful but unemotional?

549
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:03,978
I called her the female Pol Pot.

550
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:04,713
Mom, you didn’t.

551
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:06,929
he laughed, for like, a minute.

552
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:07,996
That’s so harsh.

553
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,477
Harsh, but true.

554
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:10,809
Can I get some water?

555
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:12,253
Why are you covering your eyes, Kirk?

556
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:13,487
In case you’re naked.

557
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,894
You thought I’d walk into my daughter’s room and get naked?

558
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:17,674
I don’t know your domestic routine.

559
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,056
Glasses are above the sink.

560
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:23,734
So you attribute any war crimes to Grandma? Any environmental disasters?

561
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:26,460
What? We were just talking. She won’t print any of it.

562
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:27,892
Why? Was it off the record?

563
00:22:27,976 --> 00:22:30,030
Yeah. Technically. It wasn’t about the inn.

564
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,171
But did you say ‘it’s off the record’?

565
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:32,582
No.

566
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:34,213
Then it’s fair game, so she can print all of it.

567
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,371
Including the limerick?

568
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,516
You did your limerick?

569
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:37,786
I am very proud of it.

570
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:40,201
I found two dirty words that rhyme with Emily.

571
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:41,012
Oh, boy.

572
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,427
Well, can’t I call the reporter and tell her it was off the record?

573
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,580
You can’t take things off the record once they’re on.

574
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:49,240
Well, so what? The chances that my mother reads American Travel are
extremely slim.

575
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:52,087
Yeah. Except for the fact that I told her about it tonight.

576
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:53,690
I needed some small talk.

577
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:58,972
What, and ‘how are the girls at the club’ and ‘ooh, that’s gorgeous, is it new’ doesn’t work anymore? Those are tried and true standbys.

578
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:01,906
Well, I told her about it and she jotted down the title. She’s going to read it.

579
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,935
Okay, well, you know what?

580
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:05,790
Fine. Let her.

581
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:06,873
It’s all true.

582
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:11,413
I’m tired of protecting people. Of being polite, of worrying about other people’s feelings.

583
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,373
Let her get all Condoleezza Rice to my Barbara Boxer if she wants.

584
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,045
Ow!

585
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:16,365
Kirk, you can open your eyes!

586
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:18,356
I’m fine. Ow, my head!

587
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:18,991
Kirk.

588
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:19,914
I’m fine!

589
00:23:20,238 --> 00:23:21,420
Ow, my toe!

590
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:22,155
Kirk!

591
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:23,677
Oh! My knee!

592
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:24,835
Kirk!

593
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:49,508
You were right. We should have tied the cannonball down.

594
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,815
Taylor, you don’t like to drive after dark, so we didn’t have time to tie the cannonball down.

595
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,327
You didn’t have the proper tools to secure it with anyway. Netting, twine -

596
00:23:56,343 --> 00:24:01,297
Yes, well, drat my luck. I took all my cannonball securing tools out of my truck just yesterday.

597
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:08,212
Must weigh about a hundred pounds.

598
00:24:08,224 --> 00:24:09,345
Something like that.

599
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:11,408
Oh, good. We’re in luck. Hey, Dean!

600
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,063
No, Taylor, I’ll move it myself.

601
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,584
Luke, don’t be headstrong.

602
00:24:14,596 --> 00:24:19,202
Once I strained my pecs lifting a birdbath and they were no good to me ever again.

603
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:20,273
What do you need, Taylor?

604
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:23,285
Got a big heavy ball here. How are your pecs?

605
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:24,499
They’re fine.

606
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:25,992
Help us to the house?

607
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:36,166
Look, buddy -

608
00:24:36,178 --> 00:24:37,274
Where do you want it, Taylor?

609
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:40,436
Uh, on the lawn is fine. We’ll put it in place tomorrow morning.

610
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:44,805
Lucky you were here.

611
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:48,655
Yeah. Lucky.

612
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:12,887
Breakfast!

613
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:16,649
Morning.

614
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:17,869
Morning! Hey, Rory, are you up?

615
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:19,213
She’s probably on the phone.

616
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:21,292
I’m not on the phone. I’m just getting dressed.

617
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,388
Coffee?

618
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:23,744
Definitely. Yes.

619
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:25,957
So, did you get any rest?

620
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:27,251
Kirk talks in his sleep.

621
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:28,247
Anything juicy?

622
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:29,218
He deals blackjack.

623
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,313
Hm. Kirk?

624
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:31,049
Yeah?

625
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:33,090
Turn off the TV, come have your breakfast.

626
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:33,837
In a minute.

627
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:34,696
Now.

628
00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:35,809
How old is he?

629
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:37,788
You’d have to cut him open and count the rings.

630
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,801
Morning.

631
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:43,016
You really should see a sleep therapist.

632
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,668
Roulette?

633
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,427
Blackjack.

634
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:45,274
Sorry.

635
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:47,479
Kirk, is the TV still on?

636
00:25:47,578 --> 00:25:48,437
Oh, I forgot!

637
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:49,807
No, no. I’ll get it.

638
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,433
You’d forget your head if it wasn’t screwed
on.

639
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,774
Don’t deny that you were on the phone.

640
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:54,957
Phone’s in the living room.

641
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:57,571
Oh, that’s your phone? It rang about an hour ago.

642
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:58,231
It was ringing?

643
00:25:58,442 --> 00:25:58,853
No.

644
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,688
Knock it off.

645
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:00,721
What are you guys talking about?

646
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:04,331
Fine.

647
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,070
No forts.

648
00:26:07,657 --> 00:26:13,084
Now, I don’t know what all your plans are, but the grand opening of the Stars Hollow Museum is this morning. Any takers?

649
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:15,661
It’s always amusing when provincials grasp for legitimacy.

650
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,161
I’m in.

651
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:17,020
I wouldn’t miss it.

652
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:17,978
I helped build it.

653
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:18,837
Bully.

654
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:20,978
All right, well, finish up here, grab your jackets and we’ll go.

655
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,273
I don’t need a jacket.

656
00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:23,406
Well, it’s chilly, Kirk.

657
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:24,900
I don’t want to wear a jacket.

658
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:28,423
Well, then, maybe you won’t go to the grand opening of the Stars Hollow museum.

659
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:30,427
I’ll put on my jacket.

660
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:31,946
Finish your breakfast first.

661
00:26:32,844 --> 00:26:35,072
Kirk. Do not turn that TV on.

662
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:38,371
Kirk! I mean it, Kirk!

663
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,105
Please enjoy the museum, and come back for some punch.

664
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:44,810
Good morning, ladies!

665
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:45,831
Hi, Patty.

666
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,931
Oh, I remember you! You poor thing.

667
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:49,702
Thanks.

668
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,619
It’s three dollars each. That includes the punch. Would you like yours now?

669
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,225
Oh, how about later? After I eat a loaf of bread, a pound of crackers and chase it with a quart of olive oil.

670
00:26:58,973 --> 00:27:01,363
Well, it’s not my punch if it’s not strong.

671
00:27:02,127 --> 00:27:03,222
Hey, are you guys coming? Oh!

672
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:04,455
looks like we’re the first group in.

673
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,397
I’ll catch up. I told Lane I’d meet up with her.

674
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:06,969
‘Kay, see you.

675
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:07,330
Bye.

676
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:09,222
How are you doing?

677
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:10,717
I’m fine.

678
00:27:11,726 --> 00:27:13,257
Doyle’s probably called me at the dorm,

679
00:27:13,294 --> 00:27:15,858
and my not calling him back
means he may never call me again.

680
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,315
There you go. There you have it.

681
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:19,307
Paris, you’ve come this far. Don’t buckle.

682
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:20,420
I don’t want to buckle.

683
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,727
I really don’t want to buckle.

684
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:23,470
Here. Keep it for me.

685
00:27:23,532 --> 00:27:24,727
Your cell phone? Are you sure?

686
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,146
Remove the temptation.

687
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:27,939
You got it. There’s Lane.

688
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:28,736
Hello.

689
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:29,746
What’s wrong with you?

690
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:31,053
I don’t want to talk about it.

691
00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:32,086
Well, we’re a fun group.

692
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:34,401
Paris -

693
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:35,771
We paid our three dollars.

694
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:39,104
Miss Patty’s leftover punch is used to remove tar from construction sites.

695
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:40,859
Then let it remove the tar from our souls.

696
00:27:44,777 --> 00:27:45,324
Here it is.

697
00:27:45,337 --> 00:27:47,129
Oh, it’s nice!

698
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:49,105
You really turned this around fast, huh?

699
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,649
Well, it was a team effort.

700
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:52,466
Hey look, old letters!

701
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:53,783
Oh, I love those!

702
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:55,563
Letter from Olivia Taft.

703
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:58,111
Reported
grand-niece by marriage to president William Taft.

704
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:03,807
Written to Chester Hobart, assumed distant relative to Garret Hobart, vice-president to William McKinley. Wow.

705
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:05,948
Oh, I love history.

706
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:10,068
Ooh! Possibly rare 48 star American flag!

707
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,287
Ah, look at that.

708
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:14,823
Oh, someone was supposed to take the Sears tag off of that.

709
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:15,551
What’s this?

710
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:17,978
Civil War era cannonball!

711
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:19,609
Ah, where’s the cannonball?

712
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:20,356
Flashlights!

713
00:28:20,468 --> 00:28:21,625
I don’t see it!

714
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:23,941
Oh, wait, right there! Right there!

715
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,133
Ooh! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, cool!

716
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:27,005
Ladies and gentlemen.

717
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:31,623
Our audio-visual presentation will commence in five minutes. Five minutes, everybody.

718
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:33,562
Hey, check out that painting!

719
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,541
Oh, yeah, actually that’s pretty cool.

720
00:28:35,802 --> 00:28:43,070
It’s a possible circa nineteenth century portrait of what we think may have been the founder of a school that possibly educated Ben Franklin’s cousin.

721
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:53,377
He just flat out looked out of his face right into my face and said to my face that he was lying.

722
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,182
Zach said that he was lying?

723
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:58,555
No. He lied from his face into my face

724
00:28:58,593 --> 00:29:01,804
about where he was going. That’s what hurts the most, the lie!

725
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:05,696
Except for seeing him with that woman! That hurts most, more than the lie.

726
00:29:05,758 --> 00:29:08,285
You’d think they’d stumble onto the truth.

727
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:13,245
Just accidentally. Say something like two plus two equals four.

728
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:16,838
Just because they say so many things just accidentally, that’s like -

729
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:18,282
man!

730
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:19,190
I know!

731
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:21,499
They just have to repopulate the species.

732
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:23,254
You know? Just spread it around.

733
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:25,433
Oh, they like to spread it around, all right.

734
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,010
I bet you Doyle’s spreading it right now.

735
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,503
You don’t know that he’s spreading it.

736
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,779
This - is tasty.

737
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:33,987
I’ve had it!

738
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:34,833
Had what?

739
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,800
I’m getting to the bottom of this.

740
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,958
Spank his bottom!

741
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:43,448
He can’t do this! We’re friends too, as well as lovers if we ever get married!

742
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:47,702
She walks funny.

743
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,565
I’m thirsty. This punch makes you thirsty.

744
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,505
Where is the nearest bathroom?

745
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:54,907
No. Paris, no. Stay.

746
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,339
I need to go to the bathroom.

747
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:57,874
You’re going to call Doyle.

748
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:58,372
What?

749
00:29:58,692 --> 00:29:59,663
You’ve got my cell phone.

750
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:02,252
We’re low-tech here in the Hollow, but we do have payphones.

751
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:03,833
I’m not going to call Doyle.

752
00:30:03,858 --> 00:30:04,356
Yes you are.

753
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:05,713
I don’t even have money on me.

754
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:06,360
Uh-huh.

755
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:06,883
Fine.

756
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:09,223
Take my shoes, okay?

757
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:11,578
How far can I get without my shoes?

758
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:13,462
Now, bathroom?

759
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:14,184
Over there.

760
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,251
I’ll be right back.

761
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:15,973
Good.

762
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:24,431
Excuse me?

763
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:25,875
Could I trouble you for some change?

764
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:29,951
Excuse me, I just need some change to make a call. Could you -

765
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:33,038
I just need to make a call!

766
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:41,161
Where are we going?

767
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:41,883
You’ll see.

768
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:42,630
What is this?

769
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:44,236
You wouldn’t want me to spoil it.

770
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:49,103
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Stars Hollow dioramic history room presentation.

771
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:53,855
Please stand toward the center of
the room, and remember, no talking, no smoking, and please,

772
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:56,855
no lewd behavior
of any kind during our presentation.

773
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:58,756
Hey!

774
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:01,744
I’m just getting the lewd behavior out of the way before the presentation.

775
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:04,409
It’s the dawn of time.

776
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:08,405
And whether you believe that a Supreme Being created the earth,

777
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,779
or in the more and more discredited theory of evolution,

778
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,951
one thing’s for certain.

779
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:17,461
Early man walked the land we are now on.

780
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:23,378
And while no printed record survived, there’s no proof that the first tools weren’t invented right here

781
00:31:23,455 --> 00:31:25,396
in Stars Hollow.

782
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,782
That wrench is really getting him hot.

783
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,580
there’s people!

784
00:31:34,617 --> 00:31:35,551
That’s half the fun.

785
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:38,729
Zooming forward in time to the founding

786
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:40,335
of Stars Hollow.

787
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,387
The very first people to live on this land, besides the Indians, was the Jebediah family.

788
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,621
Good puritans, they were led by the humble Reverend Ezekiel.

789
00:31:50,646 --> 00:31:57,479
With him was wife Louisa, daughter Harriet, and young son Joseph, born without speech.

790
00:31:57,591 --> 00:32:02,291
I wonder what that first conversation was when they rode up to their new home?

791
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,764
Whoa, boy. Good girl. You smell that air, mother?

792
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,429
It smells like home, Ezekiel.

793
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,574
Ho, ho, ho, ho. And look at this fertile soil. Just a-wantin’ to yield crops.

794
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,276
It smells like home, Ezekiel.

795
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:16,264
But what of the young’uns? What have they to say of their new home?

796
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:19,883
We can run in the woods, play games, and be schooled at home!

797
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:27,464
Hey! My divining rod is twitching! That means there’s water a-plenty.

798
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:29,727
Better get inside, children, it’s time for supper.

799
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:32,951
Okay, mother. I’m hungry. You hungry, too, Joseph?

800
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:39,060
Those stars. So bright. This forest, hollow.

801
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:40,812
What name should I give this place?

802
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:45,679
Hollow. Stars. Hollow. Stars.

803
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:51,494
No. Really? They’re going to leave us on a cliffhanger?

804
00:32:57,172 --> 00:32:57,757
Sophie!

805
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,757
Geez, Lane, I don’t have time for coffee right now.

806
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:04,542
You owe me an explanation! You - woman!

807
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:05,974
What are you talking about?

808
00:33:06,011 --> 00:33:12,011
You know what I’m talking about. I look to you as a role model. Well, not anymore, except as a role model for heartbreak!

809
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:16,075
I know what you can offer him. You’re bohemian, and experienced,

810
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:20,230
familiar with the world of sensual pleasure, champagne, Times Square.

811
00:33:20,254 --> 00:33:21,848
I bet you’ve even smoked a cigarette or two!

812
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:24,387
Oh my God, your breath would stop an elephant!

813
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:28,796
You’ve not only been to New York, but you’ve lived there. You know where the best bagels are and you’ve been with men.

814
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:31,277
But you don’t know him
like I know him.

815
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:36,045
It’s cheap thrills for you, sister! But I know what cleaning products he likes. Do you?

816
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,046
I’m not sure how to answer that.

817
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:41,631
It had to have been a moment of weakness, because he doesn’t like you! He likes me!

818
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:42,216
Who?

819
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:42,863
Zach!

820
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:43,519
Zach?

821
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:44,254
Zach!

822
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:45,636
Come here.

823
00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:50,284
Zach?

824
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:51,504
Lane!

825
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:52,650
Talk!

826
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,579
Why are you playing a banjo?

827
00:33:54,604 --> 00:33:59,471
It’s a bluegrass band, okay? I like bluegrass. I like jamming with these guys, and yes, I like the banjo.

828
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:00,930
But why didn’t you tell me?

829
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:04,029
Because we’re rock and roll, Lane. You and me.

830
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,440
I was embarrassed. So the guys and I have been jamming on the sly here.

831
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,657
Sophie let us.

832
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:10,536
I like the banjo.

833
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:13,537
Well, I like the banjo too,

834
00:34:13,674 --> 00:34:14,745
when you’re playing it.

835
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:15,467
Really?

836
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:16,288
Yeah.

837
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:17,807
It’s kind of hot.

838
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:19,836
The guys are watching.

839
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:20,483
Well,

840
00:34:21,294 --> 00:34:22,502
go back to your playing.

841
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:22,950
Cool.

842
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:26,908
Oh! And I got three things of Pine-Sol. I’ve been dying to tell you!

843
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,879
But there’s been this weird thing between us.

844
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:29,514
Lemon?

845
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:31,506
Yeah. Because I know that’s what you like.

846
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:35,573
Let’s hit it, boys.

847
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:45,934
Hey, I need some change here.

848
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:50,353
Come on, damn it! Yeah, keep walking. Keep walking!

849
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:52,108
Hey!

850
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:57,101
Hey, I need fifty cents! Come on! Just fifty cents! Watch it!

851
00:34:59,236 --> 00:34:59,559
Hey!

852
00:35:00,662 --> 00:35:01,757
Give me fifty cents!

853
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,512
Fall in a hole!

854
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:20,238
Hey, it’s Logan. Leave whatever message you want.

855
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:23,698
And if this is Finn? Buddy, your voicemail is full! Again!

856
00:35:23,723 --> 00:35:26,337
We’re meeting at the Starwood, nine-thirty, then just club-hopping from there.

857
00:35:26,364 --> 00:35:31,219
There’s eleven of us, so bring the Hummer. Don’t be more than a half hour late, and erase those stupid messages.

858
00:35:36,715 --> 00:35:38,794
Sanitation in wartime.

859
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:40,661
No one likes to think about it,

860
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:44,010
but in Stars Hollow that’s all we thought about.

861
00:35:44,296 --> 00:35:46,413
A local manufacturer, Buff-Rite,

862
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:52,475
was the sole supplier of all things pertaining to sanitation and hygiene for our boys in World War two.

863
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:55,464
Remember their snappy theme song?

864
00:35:55,493 --> 00:36:00,223
Walk light, smell right, head held high with Buff-Rite!

865
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:03,867
Closed due to a dramatic drop in demand for its chief products,

866
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:11,068
urinal cakes, the Buff-Rite factory nevertheless afforded hundreds of Stars Hollow residents healthy livelihoods.

867
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:13,135
The Buff-Rite diorama is dedicated -

868
00:36:13,147 --> 00:36:14,342
Sorry, that’s me.

869
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:15,612
Oh, I’ve got to take this.

870
00:36:15,637 --> 00:36:17,492
I’ll meet you outside. I’ve seen enough.

871
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:19,073
I can’t get enough.

872
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:23,103
Walk light, smell right -

873
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,452
Remember the sixties?

874
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:28,560
The town of Stars Hollow does! What a headache!

875
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,287
A veritable dark age,

876
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:35,009
culminating in a sit-in that gathered over a thousand freaks from the Tri-county area.

877
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:37,276
Hello?

878
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:39,853
Uh, hi, Lorelai! It’s Sandra from American Travel.

879
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:42,123
Sandra, hi. Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.

880
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:43,430
No problem, what’s up?

881
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:44,675
Well, I was just thinking about -

882
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,650
Oh, it was great, by the way. Everyone just flipped for it here.

883
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:49,706
Oh, wonderful. Thank you.

884
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:55,419
But I just wanted to let you know, I think I may have crossed a line with the stuff about my mother?

885
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:57,022
What? No! It was the best part!

886
00:36:57,163 --> 00:36:58,781
Oh, so it’s in the article?

887
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:01,482
It’s not the dominant thing, but it’s in. It’s great color.

888
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:02,105
Right.

889
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:07,018
Well, I was wondering if maybe you could lose some of that color. Would that screw things up too much?

890
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:09,542
Oh, but the stuff about your mother is great! My editor flipped.

891
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:11,925
Wow. So it’s already gone to an editor?

892
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:13,332
We turn things around pretty quickly.

893
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:15,224
I guess so. You know,

894
00:37:15,286 --> 00:37:18,748
Sandra, I would really like you to cut all the stuff about my mother.

895
00:37:19,246 --> 00:37:20,889
Um, it would be a big favour.

896
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:23,525
I would really rather not. It was a lot of work.

897
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,592
Okay, couldn’t you just do a quick re-write, for a friend?

898
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:26,600
We’re not friends.

899
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:27,284
Oh, right.

900
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:31,364
Look. It’s too late to change it. The only other option we have is pulling it altogether.

901
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:32,028
Pulling it?

902
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:33,908
Yeah, and just subbing in something else.

903
00:37:33,982 --> 00:37:35,588
The whole article? The cover and everything?

904
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:36,559
The whole thing.

905
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:37,655
Oh.

906
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,739
Look, don’t worry about it. It’s great. It flies by.

907
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,257
The readers are going to love it, okay?

908
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:43,059
Okay,

909
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:43,843
sure.

910
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,910
Thanks for calling me back. Bye.

911
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,122
I’m sure looking forward to work today!

912
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:51,097
Haley, put your Etch-a-Sketch away and come sit down.

913
00:37:51,222 --> 00:37:51,993
What’s this?

914
00:37:52,127 --> 00:37:53,708
Modern life in Stars Hollow.

915
00:37:53,745 --> 00:37:55,227
Great breakfast, mother.

916
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:57,626
Yeah, you’ve done it again, mom!

917
00:37:57,713 --> 00:38:00,489
I just love serving breakfast to my family.

918
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:02,045
And I love Jesus!

919
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,540
Look at these clamouring crowds, partner!

920
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:08,270
Yeah, people seem to be having a good time.

921
00:38:08,295 --> 00:38:11,926
It was a rush job, but spectacular. It’s more than I thought it would be.

922
00:38:11,939 --> 00:38:12,910
Oh, way more.

923
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,960
I’m seriously considering going permanent with this.

924
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:16,372
What?

925
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:20,767
Well, I think we’ve got something here. Something big. A two-month run isn’t enough!

926
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:23,091
We’ve at least got to hold it over through the summer!

927
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:23,577
Taylor -

928
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,141
I’m thinking we should keep it open for at least a year.

929
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:27,644
Even if it doesn’t make money.

930
00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:30,183
At that point, we’ve got the publicity.

931
00:38:30,196 --> 00:38:35,478
We’ve made the guidebooks. My God! We’ll have a Cooperstown-type attraction on our hands!

932
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:36,200
Taylor, no!

933
00:38:36,673 --> 00:38:37,071
What?

934
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:40,011
Are you blind? This place is a piece of crap!

935
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:40,842
What? A piece of -

936
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:44,352
Look at it! The old man’s stuff - it’s not even historical!

937
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:49,808
It’s all a bunch of stuff that may have belonged to people who may have distantly related to people who may have been historically meaningful!

938
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:50,543
And the diorama

939
00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:52,111
Well, I’ll admit, it’s a little rough -

940
00:38:52,136 --> 00:38:52,883
It’s a joke.

941
00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:54,606
Luke, I don’t get it.

942
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:58,810
You helped build this! You were so co-operative! Why are you turning on it like this? Turning on me?

943
00:38:58,832 --> 00:38:59,902
I want the house.

944
00:38:59,977 --> 00:39:00,438
What?

945
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:02,043
I want this house, Taylor.

946
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:06,878
All my life I’ve loved this house. They don’t build them like this anymore. I mean, you saw the banisters, right?

947
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:07,924
Well, yeah, but -

948
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:12,240
No. I’ve always said to myself if you’re going to have a family and buy a house, then it’s got to be this house.

949
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,012
Oh -

950
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:18,399
It’s why I volunteered, okay? I got involved with this whole thing to stay close to the house and

951
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:20,980
keep on your good side. You had the control.

952
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:24,931
I should have known that you were doing this for selfish reasons.

953
00:39:25,006 --> 00:39:26,326
Taylor, look.

954
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:28,504
I know you don’t like me, I can’t change that.

955
00:39:28,554 --> 00:39:33,148
But I’ve got to be honest here. This museum is not going to make it. This

956
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:36,809
property, these expenses, the taxes, the upkeep. I mean,

957
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:40,133
the floor broke through from just the cannonball. It’s going to take money.

958
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:47,549
Do you want to keep a money loser on the books? Do you want that to be your
legacy in Stars Hollow? Because that’s what this is, Taylor. It’s a money pit.

959
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:49,155
Well, I don’t want a money pit on the books.

960
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:53,786
Just keep it open for the two months, then sell it to me. I’ll give you the best price, I swear.

961
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,365
A family. You mean, you and Lorelai -

962
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:59,240
Me and - whoever. Yeah.

963
00:39:59,464 --> 00:39:59,863
Huh.

964
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,576
Well, I’ll think about it.

965
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:11,238
We have got to bring everyone we know to this thing immediately, before the Nederlanders swoop in and whisk it away to Broadway.

966
00:40:11,263 --> 00:40:14,748
And at three bucks a pop. That crappy Epis show costs a hundred bucks.

967
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:17,172
I’ve got to make a quick call, maybe we’ll go through again.

968
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:18,766
Once is not enough!

969
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:27,102
Sandra, hi. It’s Lorelai Gilmore, again.

970
00:40:27,164 --> 00:40:31,135
Listen, I was thinking, I think you should just pull the article.

971
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:34,748
Yeah, I’m sure. But thanks. Okay. Bye.

972
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:41,103
So, was it all I said it would be?

973
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:42,323
Oh, and more!

974
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,049
I’ve got to go through with Rory, have you seen her anywhere?

975
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,506
Haven’t seen her, no.

976
00:40:46,941 --> 00:40:47,389
Wow.

977
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:48,074
What?

978
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,340
I just never really looked at this place before. Those columns, and that brick.

979
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:53,187
Yeah.

980
00:40:53,346 --> 00:40:54,056
It’s beautiful.

981
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:55,774
Yeah. It’s a great house.

982
00:40:56,197 --> 00:40:56,695
Mom.

983
00:40:57,965 --> 00:40:59,496
Aw, Rory, honey, what’s wrong?

984
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:01,973
I don’t feel good. I really don’t feel good.

985
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:04,691
I think I can, uh, guess why. Come on, let’s get you home.

986
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:05,848
You need help? Want me to drive?

987
00:41:05,903 --> 00:41:07,795
It’s okay, it’s just five minutes. Come on.

988
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:28,630
Okay, Dean. Come on. Give me that attitude. What’s up?

989
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:31,867
What is this, still about the Pippi night? The Bop-it?

990
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,730
Fine. You hate me, whatever.

991
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:39,257
You want to punch me? Go ahead, I’m a terrible guy, I deserve it. Go ahead, take a shot. I won’t even fight back.

992
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:40,739
Make you feel better, huh, buddy?

993
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,047
Just go back to your girlfriend.

994
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,167
Fine. Whatever.

995
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:44,661
While you’ve got one.

996
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,715
What’s that supposed to mean?

997
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,810
What do you think it means?

998
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:49,080
I’m not playing games here!

999
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:51,512
Your situation is no different from mine. Buddy.

1000
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,758
I’ve got work to do.

1001
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:53,517
Then go.

1002
00:41:54,538 --> 00:41:55,559
They want more than this.

1003
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:57,102
Don’t you see that?

1004
00:41:57,538 --> 00:41:59,704
And all you are is this.

1005
00:42:00,657 --> 00:42:04,690
Rory was a kid, Dean. She grew up. She moved on. Accept it.

1006
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,611
You accept it.

1007
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,399
This town, it’s all you are, and it’s not enough.

1008
00:42:08,698 --> 00:42:11,351
She’s going to get bored, and you can’t take her anywhere.

1009
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:13,081
You’re here forever.

1010
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,828
It’s different.

1011
00:42:14,027 --> 00:42:14,874
It’s not different.

1012
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:16,056
You and me.

1013
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:17,550
Same thing.

1014
00:42:28,888 --> 00:42:30,904
Why doesn’t he like me?

1015
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,589
Why doesn’t he call me? What did I do?

1016
00:42:35,226 --> 00:42:37,790
Sh, honey, it’s okay. It’s okay.

1017
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:39,147
Logan

1018
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,475
Sh, it’s okay.
