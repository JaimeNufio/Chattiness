1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,129
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,549
- Your nephew's coming to visit.
- No, he's coming to stay.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:08,926
Luke is a great guy.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,802
He really wants to take care of you.

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,804
You're incredibly lucky to have him.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,765
What? Are you sleeping with him
or something?

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,058
Hey.

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,142
I'm Rory.

9
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,352
Yeah, I figured.

10
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,438
- How long is he staying?
- I don't know. Indefinitely.

11
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,108
You don't know anything about me,
or my life, or my mom, or Luke.

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,361
So why don't you Dr. Laura someone else?

13
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,530
I'm going inside. Stay out of my fridge.

14
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,116
I'm sorry. That kid is way more
screwed up than you think he is.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,661
- Why are you only nice to me?
- Excuse me?

16
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,287
I am concerned about Jess.

17
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,914
- You shouldn't be.
- But I am.

18
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,457
What do you want from me?

19
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,376
You bring me here,
you put me in a school...

20
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,170
that says the Pledge of Allegiance
in six languages...

21
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,047
two of which I've never heard of!

22
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,008
You take me away from my home,
my friends, and now you want...

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,760
- what from me?
- I'm trying to help you!

24
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:52,886
Stop trying!

25
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,013
I read a lot. Do you read?

26
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,181
Not much.

27
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,224
I'm worried about Rory.

28
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,101
She shouldn't be hanging out
with this guy.

29
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,812
- You've read this before.
- About 40 times.

30
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,939
I thought you said you didn't read much.

31
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,357
What is much?

32
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,693
What was I thinking?
Why did I say yes to this?

33
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,196
You saw a kid in need of help
and you thought you'd throw him a line.

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,699
But me? Raising a kid?
I don't even like kids.

35
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,783
Why'd you call?

36
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,786
- I wanted to...
- I'm glad you called.

37
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,996
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,875
He's gonna get her into trouble.
I can feel it. I just know it.

39
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,969
- It still hurts!
- Do you need stitches?

40
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,637
- Probably.
- We should go to a doctor.

41
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,599
No doctors. You go into a hospital,
you don't come out again!

42
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,184
Well said, Ida Morgenstern.

43
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,768
I'm starving. I need pancakes.

44
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,938
Can I just ask what on earth
you thought you were doing?

45
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,232
I thought I was being
a self-sufficient woman.

46
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,734
You hate ladders and heights.

47
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,444
We needed our rain gutters cleaned.

48
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,029
Hire somebody.

49
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,739
Aren't we suddenly a Rockefeller.

50
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,616
It's better than you killing yourself.

51
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,202
I'm fine. I'm just being dramatic.
It's what I do.

52
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,078
- No more ladders.
- I promise.

53
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,872
I think I have gangrene.

54
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,624
- You do not.
- And vertigo.

55
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,126
- Oh, boy.
- One leg feels shorter than the other.

56
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,088
This is gonna be the Vanity Fair
paper-cut incident all over again, isn't it?

57
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,548
Leave your bandage alone.

58
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,176
It's turning purple,
but a really glowy purple! Look!

59
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,719
No, thanks.

60
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,681
Maybe our rain gutters are radioactive
or made out of some kind of alien metal...

61
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,435
so when I cut my hand, I got infected
with an extraterrestrial substance...

62
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,104
which is altering my internal makeup.

63
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,440
- Maybe I'll turn into a superhero!
- Maybe.

64
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:31,902
Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up
and suddenly be able to shower really fast.

65
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,530
We'll go pick out your cape after breakfast.

66
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,173
God, I'm starving.
Must be from the loss of blood.

67
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,507
Yes, that must be it.

68
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,843
I'm getting pancakes
with a side of pancakes.

69
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,179
- Where's Luke?
- I don't know. Storage room?

70
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,765
- Caesar's cooking.
- Why is Caesar cooking?

71
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,684
- I don't know.
- That's bad.

72
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,394
- His pancakes stink.
- They do stink.

73
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,605
What do we do, resort to donuts?

74
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,023
Wait here.

75
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,866
Luke, are you in there?

76
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,744
Luke, are you okay?

77
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,579
Stupid lamp!

78
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:09,208
Are you being attacked
by your possessions again?

79
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:10,918
What're you doing?

80
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,669
I'm looking for my supply ledger.

81
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,296
- Is it going well?
- It's going fine.

82
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,965
You have a sock on your shoulder.
Is it helping you look?

83
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,510
- What're you doing up here?
- Rory and I are starving.

84
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,012
We need you to cook us breakfast.

85
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,973
- Oh, my God.
- Caesar can make you breakfast.

86
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,684
- What happened to this place?
- Nothing.

87
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,479
This is what I pictured
the inside of my head to look like.

88
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,732
- Find a brown leather ledger.
- I've never seen so much stuff.

89
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,110
- It looks like a white-trash Hearst Castle.
- I'll find it myself.

90
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,237
Where'd all this come from?

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,739
Jess. Liz shipped
the rest of his stuff last week.

92
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,908
- He finally unpacked.
- He did a very nice job.

93
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,744
It's crazy now,
but I just have to get it all organized...

94
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,413
figure out where to put everything,
buy another dresser...

95
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,165
a portable wardrobe, some storage bins.

96
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,416
Gasoline, box of matches.

97
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,418
Did I mention
Caesar can cook you breakfast?

98
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,338
He doesn't make the good, fluffy pancakes
like you do.

99
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,549
- Then order eggs.
- No.

100
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,262
- See, I had a near-death experience today.
- Really?

101
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,431
I almost fell off the roof
trying to clean the rain gutters...

102
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,017
so I have to have pancakes. Please?

103
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,020
I'll help you shower
when I become a superhero.

104
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,064
You've been in there for two hours.

105
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,608
My hair just ain't bouncing
and behaving today.

106
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,944
There are other people living here, too.

107
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,280
Learn something new every day.

108
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,117
His people skills are really improving.

109
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,452
Go downstairs.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

110
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,829
- How long is that?
- I don't know.

111
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:29,997
- An estimate.
- I don't know.

112
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,915
Ballpark figure. Off the top of your head.

113
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,501
- Will you...
- Did I mention I almost fell off my roof?

114
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,171
I'd lie down if I could find the bed.

115
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,048
- Is this what you're looking for?
- Great. Thank you.

116
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,592
Not unless you make the pancakes.

117
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,469
- Give me the book.
- Give me the pancake!

118
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,597
- Come on.
- Thank you.

119
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:51,435
You sure you weren't almost pushed off
the roof of your house today?

120
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,106
I think I'm finally ready to get a tattoo.

121
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,149
- Please.
- I am.

122
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,485
- You've been saying that for five years.
- But I mean it this time.

123
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,904
Fine. What are you getting?

124
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,114
- Mel Brooks.
- Why?

125
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,490
What do you mean 'why'?

126
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,660
The 2000 Year Old Man,
Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie.

127
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,538
Hasn't Mel has earned the right
to have his face on my butt?

128
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,831
I am so sorry, Mel.

129
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,042
He'll love it. Trust me.

130
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,003
Rocky road hot fudge sundaes
and two cans of whipped cream?

131
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,255
Trying to give Mel
a bigger canvas to work with?

132
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,175
The man's a legend. He deserves the best.

133
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,511
- What?
- Luke.

134
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,597
- What's he doing?
- I'm not sure.

135
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,725
Get the ice cream and make sure
they give us maraschino cherries.

136
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,310
- Okay.
- Thanks.

137
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,117
- What are you doing?
- Rory and I just hit the video store.

138
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,912
We're going home to eat something
you wouldn't approve of.

139
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,372
Sounds good.

140
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,874
What are you doing?

141
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,334
Watching TV.

142
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,547
That's cute. Is it the first time
it's been away from its mother?

143
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,423
It's a very good TV.

144
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,385
Black and white,
coat-hanger antenna, really bad reception.

145
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,803
It's fine.

146
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,721
Don't you have a fully grown TV upstairs?

147
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,598
Yeah, well, Jess is upstairs.

148
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,684
- So?
- So when Jess is upstairs...

149
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,603
that means the stereo's blaring
and the place is a mess.

150
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,313
I just needed a little privacy.

151
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:22,109
So you came downstairs
to sit on an uncomfortable chair...

152
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,695
in an empty diner
that smells like onion rings.

153
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,779
Calgon take me away!

154
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,699
It was very peaceful
until two minutes ago.

155
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,160
Did you ever think that maybe
you should get a bigger apartment?

156
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,537
I don't need one.

157
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,581
That place upstairs
was your father's office.

158
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,292
You made it an apartment.
It wasn't meant to be lived in.

159
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,377
- It's fine.
- It's too small for two people.

160
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,172
It's too small for one person
if they have any kind of life.

161
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,798
We'll make do. We just need to...

162
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:48,177
No, you don't need to organize.
You need to move.

163
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,761
I like my apartment.

164
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,389
It's not just your apartment.
Jess lives there also.

165
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,473
Jess is fine.

166
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:57,477
He could be pinned under a box for a year
in that place and you wouldn't know it...

167
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,689
until the neighbors started to complain
about the smell.

168
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,567
Rory. Perfect. Get her out of here.

169
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,778
Okay, fine. I'm leaving.
Think about what I said.

170
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,407
You ever hire anybody
to do that work for you?

171
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,491
- What?
- The rain gutters?

172
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,203
No, not yet. Are you offering?

173
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,455
Actually, I was thinking about Jess.

174
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,918
He's always looking for a little extra cash.
He doesn't make that much here...

175
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,629
and I hate to think of where else
he might try to get it.

176
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,548
You don't have to pay him the same
as you would someone else.

177
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,592
You save a little. He keeps busy.

178
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:33,138
Yeah, well, maybe. I actually have to check
with a couple of people...

179
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,475
that I'm supposed to hear from,
but if they can't do it, then, sure.

180
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,809
Great. Just let me know.

181
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,145
I will. Bye.

182
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,445
Who are all these people you asked
to clean out our gutters?

183
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,571
- You know.
- I do?

184
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,989
- Sure.
- Remind me?

185
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,824
Okay, there's Cid.

186
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,201
Cid, right.

187
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,370
And then there's Lou.

188
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,038
Yeah, a good man, Lou.

189
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,124
And also Moose, if Doris will let him
out of the house again...

190
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,710
after that incident
at Chicky's bachelor party.

191
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,172
I thought you said
you were gonna give Jess a chance.

192
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,674
I am.

193
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,300
Then why won't you hire him?

194
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,971
I'm just... not very comfortable
with him, Rory.

195
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,347
Try and get comfortable.

196
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,140
- I don't know if I can.
- But you said...

197
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,601
I know what I said, but I can't help it.

198
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:23,021
- How many times can I tell you...
- That I don't know the real Jess?

199
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,483
Fine, I don't know him,
but I'm not too fond of his stand-in.

200
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,694
People are different
once you get to know them.

201
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,530
- You weren't too fond of Luke at first.
- That's not true.

202
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,740
You called him Duke for two years
to make him mad.

203
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,660
- And let me tell you, it worked.
- But then you guys talked...

204
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,788
and eventually, time went by.
Now you love him.

205
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,584
I'm just asking you
to give Jess that same chance.

206
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,586
Rory, you like him.

207
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,088
- I don't have to like him.
- Please.

208
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,553
- Can I at least call him Tess for a while?
- You'll give him the job?

209
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,305
I'll give him the job.

210
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,473
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

211
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,230
- Tell me something.
- What?

212
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,025
Why is it so important to you
that I like him?

213
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,613
I just think that he's Luke's nephew,
and we like Luke...

214
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:16,742
we eat at Luke's every day, we see Jess
when we eat there every day...

215
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,037
and that it just might make things nicer
if you liked him.

216
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,207
And that's the only reason?
It's all about Luke and the diner.

217
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:27,794
It's got nothing to do with you.
So you and Jess aren't... friends?

218
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,922
Yeah, we're friends.

219
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,216
I mean...

220
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,718
we're not good friends, but we're friends.

221
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,846
We're friendly.
But that doesn't mean that...

222
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,934
we're friends in the traditional Webster's
Dictionary definition of 'friends. '

223
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,018
Right.

224
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,937
- 'Friendish' might be a better term.
- Okay.

225
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,647
'Friendish. ' Got it.

226
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,982
And walk. And pump your arms and walk.

227
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,194
And shoulders back, tuchis in.
Think about that double chin.

228
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,614
And walk. And tummies tight and walk.

229
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,032
Match me, sweetheart.

230
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,390
How can anyone sleep through that?
It's like the Huns are attacking.

231
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,936
You're oblivious. That's why you lie there
while the rest of the world is going deaf.

232
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,398
Great.

233
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,484
Damn it.

234
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,535
- What the hell!
- I can't stand it! I'm going crazy!

235
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,996
This place is awful!
I can't live like this anymore.

236
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,832
- Just relax.
- I can't relax. I can't sleep.

237
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,377
I'm having nightmares about being
chased around by boxes with arms...

238
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,172
and they tackle me and pile clothing
on top of my face...

239
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,340
and secure it around my head
with packing tape...

240
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,468
and I'm lying there choking
as you sit in the corner laughing...

241
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,388
- gelling your hair with a switchblade!
- Should I be putting...

242
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,640
- a tongue depressor in your mouth?
- We're moving.

243
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,725
- What?
- Tomorrow.

244
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,477
- What are you talking...
- I'm talking about us going out...

245
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,605
- and finding a new place to live.
- But I...

246
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,816
No buts! 10:00 a. m. Tomorrow,
I want you up, washed, moussed...

247
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,277
and ready to leave. End of story.

248
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,237
Now go back to bed.

249
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,531
What?

250
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,783
I need the music on to sleep.

251
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,342
- Forget it.
- What was wrong with it?

252
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,843
- It was pink.
- We can paint it.

253
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,221
- You mean I can paint it.
- We can paint it together.

254
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,223
Then we can hold hands
and skip afterwards.

255
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,350
- Fine. Which one do you like?
- The one before.

256
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,726
- The one with two fridges.
- No.

257
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,520
The one before had two fridges.

258
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,355
No, it was the one with the cat.

259
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,066
- I hate cats.
- I don't think the cat came with the place.

260
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,485
It had carpeting,
so it'll always smell like a cat.

261
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,028
- Clean the carpet.
- Paint the pink.

262
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,489
- Fine, the one next to the bank.
- Too many windows.

263
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,824
- What?
- Six windows, all on one side...

264
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,868
3:00 p. m., we're sitting in an oven.

265
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,663
- So we get curtains.
- You'll have to help me put them up.

266
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,832
Then we can hold hands
and skip afterwards.

267
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,542
- Stop saying that.
- I don't care.

268
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,211
- Pick whichever one you want.
- I'm not picking by myself.

269
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,922
- You want to move.
- So you like living the way we do.

270
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,049
- Fine by me.
- No space, no privacy?

271
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,217
I got plenty of privacy.

272
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,970
Because I'm downstairs in the dark
watching a two-inch TV.

273
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,681
- You have a problem, you make the choice.
- Jess, come on.

274
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,724
- I have to go.
- We got three more places.

275
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,477
I'm supposed to be at Lorelai's
in 20 minutes, remember?

276
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,479
- Yeah.
- If you want me to bail on her, fine.

277
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,148
- No, you go. I'll look at the places.
- Good idea.

278
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,901
I'll take some Polaroids,
and you can look at them later.

279
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,612
Take a Polaroid, paint a still picture,
whatever you want.

280
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,114
Jess, come on.

281
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,450
Nobody asked me if I wanted to move
to Stars Hollow, but I'm here.

282
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,662
Pick whatever place you want,
and I'll be there, too.

283
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,334
- Mom?
- Come here.

284
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,837
- I'm here. What's the matter?
- Sit.

285
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,256
Okay, that should do it.

286
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,841
- Do what?
- Wait.

287
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,971
- What are we waiting for?
- Patience, grasshopper.

288
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,057
- Are we close?
- Very close.

289
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,394
Getting closer.

290
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,938
- Should I get chips?
- Ready?

291
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,194
The clock is grunting.

292
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,823
This is a state-of-the-art CD clock radio
that enables you to wake up to...

293
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,451
- the barnyard animal of your choice.
- That is great.

294
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,994
I have selected the Perky Piggies.

295
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,622
You might choose the Cheery Chickens
or the Goofy Goats.

296
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,624
This is as close to a farm as I wanna get.

297
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,334
Amen, sister friend.

298
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,835
I'll get it.

299
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,716
- Hey.
- Here.

300
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,511
- The Shags?
- Trust me.

301
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,721
Okay. You're very punctual.

302
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,516
It was this or continue
apartment hunting with Luke.

303
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,643
- You're moving?
- I don't know.

304
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,852
Luke flipped out last night.

305
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:57,481
Next thing I know, he's dragging me
all over town, measuring square footage.

306
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,650
- It's crazy.
- A new place might be nice.

307
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,610
More space.
Maybe you'll get your own room.

308
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,111
- You changed your hair.
- What?

309
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,864
- Your hair looks different.
- Segue's not your thing?

310
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:09,159
- Is it?
- No, I wear it like this a lot.

311
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,079
- Why?
- Just looks different.

312
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,206
Bad different?

313
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,541
Ducks!

314
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,835
We just got a new alarm clock.

315
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,255
Bet I know the lead story
in tomorrow's Stars Hollow Gazette.

316
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,589
Did you hear the ducks?

317
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:26,760
'Cause they are great. Jess, you're here.

318
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,221
Terrific.

319
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,892
Would you like to come in?

320
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,435
Yeah. Come on in.

321
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,605
Sorry, I was just so excited
about the ducks that...

322
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,065
Do you want something to drink?

323
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,652
You have good timing, 'cause we shopped
yesterday, and in addition to...

324
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,363
a case of Maybelline Fresh Lash mascara...

325
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:50,033
I also bought some of that
new freaky Coke with the lemon in it.

326
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,910
It's very addictive.

327
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,037
- You can sit, you know.
- No, thanks.

328
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,415
- Jess, what's new?
- Not much.

329
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,750
Jess and Luke
are looking for an apartment.

330
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,086
- You guys see anything good yet?
- Nope.

331
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,132
You know, there's some
really cool places over on Peach.

332
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,800
Or on Plum.

333
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,052
Orange.

334
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:13,015
Basically, any of your fruit-named streets
are pretty nice.

335
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,519
Okay, I guess you should get started.

336
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:22,608
There's a ladder right out front and some
buckets and gloves and stuff on the porch.

337
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,068
If you need anything else
just walk against the wind.

338
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,945
Come on. I'll show you.

339
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,784
- I'm trying.
- Keep it up.

340
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,710
- Question.
- Yes?

341
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:45,255
You come over. You seem to have a very
firm grasp of the English language.

342
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,800
You put together several full sentences
using a couple of words that...

343
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,720
contain two or more syllables.
And then my mother appears.

344
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,097
Suddenly, we need a thought bubble
over your head...

345
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,974
to understand what you're thinking. Why?

346
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,476
The verbal thing comes and goes.

347
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,521
I would appreciate it if you would
try to get along with my mom.

348
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,314
- I took the Coke.
- I know.

349
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,817
I think it's a little crazy to put lemon
in Coke, but I took it anyhow.

350
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,612
- Stop it.
- Stern face.

351
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,280
I went out on a limb for you...

352
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,033
trying to get my mom
to give you the benefit of the doubt.

353
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,327
I don't think it would hurt you
to try to be nice.

354
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,912
Why?

355
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,582
Because she's my mom,
and she's a friend of Luke's.

356
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,000
- So?
- What do you mean 'so'?

357
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:26,338
Because she's your mom or Luke's friend
doesn't mean I have to get along with her.

358
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,883
My mother is a great person.
She's also my best friend in the world.

359
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:34,388
So if you care about me at all, you will
consider that and be mildly polite to her.

360
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,765
What makes you think I care about you?

361
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,519
I don't mean care, like 'care. '

362
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,939
I mean if you like me at all...
Not 'like,' like.

363
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,025
I just meant
that if you think of me remotely...

364
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,320
as the sort of person that you could
occasionally stand to talk to...

365
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,531
then you will try to get along
with my mom.

366
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,366
Okay.

367
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,910
I can't guarantee that it'll work, but I'll try.

368
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,079
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

369
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,456
I should probably get to work.

370
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,834
Right. Sorry. Go ahead.

371
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:29,526
- Inherit the Wind. Seventy-five cents.
- Great.

372
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,029
Here's a copy of Rilke's
Letters to a Young Poet...

373
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,739
which I already have, but in hardback.

374
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,701
This is a paperback. It fits perfectly
in a coat pocket, and it's only $1.

375
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,036
- Opinions?
- Get it.

376
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,996
- You look bored.
- I'm fine.

377
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,415
Sure you don't want to look?
They have great stuff.

378
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,250
- I looked.
- For five minutes.

379
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,586
No, I looked for 20 minutes,
and then I stopped...

380
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,713
and you continued for another two hours.

381
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,798
It has not been that long.

382
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,259
- Sorry.
- No big deal.

383
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,511
- Let's go.
- Are you done?

384
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,096
- I've looked enough.
- You're not done.

385
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,932
I'm fine, really. Let's go.

386
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,392
Stop it. You want to keep looking.
I know you.

387
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,936
No, I want to hang out with you.

388
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,354
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

389
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,731
I'll just pay for these, and then we can go.

390
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,275
I thought we could go see
The Lord of the Rings again.

391
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,610
- Okay.
- What?

392
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:12,736
Nothing.

393
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,655
- I thought you loved it.
- I do.

394
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,448
You said you wanted to see it 100 times.

395
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,575
Yes, and we're
being very literal these days.

396
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,119
- We'll see something else.
- Lord of the Rings is fine.

397
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,205
Can you help me with these?

398
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:26,291
- I'll give you 50 cents.
- It's 65.

399
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,127
- Fifty-five cents.
- It's for charity. There's no haggling.

400
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,506
No, there's always haggling. Sixty cents.
That's my final offer.

401
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,591
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Fine.

402
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:39,221
- Kirk, come on, cough up another nickel.
- Forget it. It's the principle of the thing.

403
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,140
You made out like a bandit.

404
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,767
You've got great stuff this year.

405
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,061
Did you see the astronomy section
over there?

406
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,229
Yeah.

407
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,647
- Didn't find anything?
- Nope.

408
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,566
- I didn't see you look over there.
- I did.

409
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,943
- Go look.
- I told you, I'm done.

410
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,363
- Where's your bracelet?
- What?

411
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,449
You're not wearing your bracelet.
Where is it?

412
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,702
- I took it off.
- Why?

413
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,164
Because I got this weird rash on my wrist.

414
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,125
- From the bracelet?
- No, just a fluke thing.

415
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,503
Actually, I think
my Spanish midterm gave it to me.

416
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,756
- But it's getting better. It's almost gone.
- Good.

417
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,886
As soon as it's completely gone,
that bracelet goes right back on.

418
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:22,723
- Compromise.
- What?

419
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,559
Look at the astronomy section,
we'll see Lord of the Rings.

420
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,853
On the way home,
we'll rent Autumn in New York...

421
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,021
and mock it all afternoon.

422
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,856
- With full-on impressions?
- Yes.

423
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:31,982
Deal.

424
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,817
Go. I'll wait here.

425
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,612
Smiling. Not at all bored.

426
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,661
- Sixty-two cents.
- Get out of here, Kirk.

427
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,704
Damn!

428
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,794
Sorry. Too loud?

429
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,379
No, it's fine.

430
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:38,882
I got a ton of leftover Chinese food
in the kitchen.

431
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,384
Thought you'd like some lunch.

432
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,094
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

433
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,226
Chinese sounds great.

434
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,395
Really?

435
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,523
- If you're sure you have enough.
- There's plenty.

436
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:57,401
Rory and I decided to take on
the chicken column last night.

437
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,777
Ambitious.

438
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,989
It's all out on the table,
so come in when you're ready.

439
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,159
- I'm ready now.
- Okay. Then I'll see you inside.

440
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,049
Basically, everything here is chicken.

441
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:24,094
You've got garlic chicken,
Kung Pao chicken, Szechwan chicken...

442
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:27,431
chicken in brown sauce,
which looks like the Szechwan chicken...

443
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,309
except it's got these peppers,
and if you eat them, you die.

444
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,894
- Plate?
- I thought I'd...

445
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,812
Soap's on the counter.

446
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:36,440
When was the last time
you had those gutters cleaned?

447
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,566
It's been a while.

448
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,319
Yeah, I found an 'I like Ike' bumper sticker
up there.

449
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,322
- Is it really bad?
- It won't be by tomorrow.

450
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,282
I like hearing that.

451
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:49,661
- You guys aren't too hot on vegetables.
- There's green pepper in the Kung Pao.

452
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,038
My mistake.

453
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,457
Are you a healthy eater like Luke?

454
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:55,459
No one's a healthy eater like Luke.

455
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,212
Euell Gibbons
wasn't a healthy eater like Luke.

456
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,048
It's been ages since I heard
a good Euell Gibbons reference.

457
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,175
- Many parts of the pine tree are edible.
- Right.

458
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:06,303
Wonder what the research process
was like to get that information.

459
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,597
- I'd say fairly painful.
- Here.

460
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,852
- How's school?
- It's still there.

461
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,689
You on any teams or anything?

462
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,902
- Not a jersey guy?
- Definitely not a jersey guy.

463
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,696
Though the thought of throwing
a ball at some jock's head...

464
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,865
isn't entirely unappealing.

465
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,703
Look, I'm not really good
at this small-talk thing.

466
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,455
You're doing okay.

467
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,749
- Cold egg roll?
- Why not?

468
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,922
- Bad?
- Yeah.

469
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:47,135
- Mom!
- Right here. What?

470
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,138
What's going on?

471
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,682
- I don't know where it is.
- What?

472
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:52,850
My bracelet. It's gone.

473
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,476
What are you talking about?

474
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,103
How could I lose that bracelet?

475
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,397
Tell me which bracelet.
Maybe I stole it from you.

476
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,523
Dean's bracelet.

477
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,859
The one he made you? It's gone? Where?

478
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,027
I don't know.
If I knew where, I would have it.

479
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,071
When did you first notice it was gone?

480
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,907
- When he pointed out I wasn't wearing it.
- What did you say?

481
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,535
That I had a rash
and had to take it off until it healed.

482
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,871
- Nice save, Gretzky.
- It's not here.

483
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,373
Let's retrace your steps.

484
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:19,168
When was the last time
you remember wearing it?

485
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,878
- I don't know.
- Think hard. Yesterday?

486
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,379
- I don't know.
- The day before?

487
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,630
- The day before that?
- Yeah.

488
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:26,091
- Really?
- No. I don't remember. I can't remember.

489
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:27,593
Help me move the couch.

490
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,094
What about your locker at school?

491
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,679
I don't know why it would be there.

492
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,432
I never take it off at school.
I never take it off at all.

493
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,933
- Anything?
- Just Grandma's pen.

494
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,560
Leave it there. It makes life fun.

495
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,770
- I'm gonna freak out now.
- We'll find it.

496
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,773
- I'll have to tell Dean that I lost it.
- Let's not go there yet.

497
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,442
- He made it.
- He'll make another one.

498
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,235
- He's gonna be mad.
- He'll understand.

499
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,278
How do you know?

500
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:49,031
Looking at the track record,
all signs point to it.

501
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,866
- Did you look in your room?
- No.

502
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,701
I'll check the car, and don't worry.

503
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,746
If we can't find it,
we'll follow Dean to work...

504
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,207
hide behind the cantaloupes,
jump him, blind him...

505
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,291
and he'll never find out.

506
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,418
As long as we have a plan.

507
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,063
Who is Randy Meenge?

508
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,607
Let me see. Maintenance.

509
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,568
Are you going to be down there long?

510
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:30,489
I just want to make sure Rory's bracelet
didn't get kicked behind something.

511
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:33,325
And so earlier when you asked me
to look for the bracelet...

512
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,537
and I told you I did look,
and I did not find it, you...

513
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,830
Just decided to double-check.

514
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,999
Yes, though another theory
is that you did not believe me.

515
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,125
I did, too.

516
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,002
I believe you thought I was lying...

517
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,630
that I did not actually get down
on my hands and knees...

518
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:49,591
in a brand-new Donna Karan suit
and crawl around on a floor...

519
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:52,761
where people who have stepped in
mud and garbage and animal waste...

520
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:55,055
have been traipsing all day long.

521
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,141
- It's not there.
- No? Why, I'm shocked.

522
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,227
I'm sorry I doubted you, Michel.

523
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,187
That means a lot. Thank you.

524
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,899
We turned the house upside down.
Rory's having a heart attack. It's awful.

525
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:09,278
As soon as my dry-cleaning bill is paid,
you will have my sympathies.

526
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,697
I will pay for your suit, Michel.

527
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,199
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

528
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:17,077
Hold on, please. It's for you.

529
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:18,745
Lorelai here.

530
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,622
I don't want a wood-burning fireplace...

531
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,457
but if I take an apartment with one...

532
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,502
even though I could give
a rat's ass about it...

533
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,589
I have to pay an extra $200 a month for it.

534
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,800
Three of the places make you
put down a $500 deposit...

535
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:32,885
if you have a dog!

536
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,012
- You don't have a dog.
- I know, but it's wrong.

537
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,889
- Agreed. What else?
- Parking!

538
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:40,309
How can people ask you
for a monthly fee for a parking space?

539
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,811
They're making money off your rent,
your utilities...

540
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:45,147
when you use their coin-operated
washer and dryer.

541
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,191
That's cash directly in their pocket...

542
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,526
and it's not even
that good a parking space.

543
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,820
It's out in the open
under one of those trees...

544
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,448
that drops the sap on your car
that eats away the paint.

545
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:55,949
Who's gonna pay for my car?

546
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:59,244
Where's my $500 paint-killing,
tree-sap deposit?

547
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:00,662
You haven't found a place yet?

548
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,164
And I've been looking all day.

549
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,333
- There wasn't one place you liked?
- No.

550
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,503
Not one place that gave you
a little feeling of:

551
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,755
'That has a nice vibe about it. '

552
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,882
I don't use the word 'vibe. '

553
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,260
Maybe one place wasn't so bad.

554
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,637
Good! Describe it to me.

555
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,140
It had walls
with a kind of a floor with a light.

556
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,559
Hold on here. If you tell me it's got a roof...

557
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,186
I'm stealing that baby from you.

558
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,730
I just can't tell anymore.
I need a second opinion.

559
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,440
Want me to look at your apartment?

560
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,984
- It's not my apartment, and yes.
- Done.

561
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,444
- Now.
- What?

562
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,487
Please.

563
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,073
I promised the woman
I'd give her an answer today.

564
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,491
Okay, give me the address.

565
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:40,577
62/, B Street, and that's another thing...

566
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,246
what's with this 'half' business?

567
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,165
Why do all these apartments
have this 'half' thing going?

568
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:48,585
It's stupid. If 62 is taken, move on to 63.

569
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:50,504
I'll meet you in 20-and-a-half minutes.

570
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,089
- Thank you.
- Bye.

571
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:56,134
Michel, I have to go out for a little while.
Cover the desk for me.

572
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,303
What?

573
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,014
I'll say I'll cover the desk...

574
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:03,183
but how will you know
if I'm actually doing it?

575
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,309
I trust you.

576
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,687
It's just as possible
I say I'll cover the desk...

577
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,272
and the moment you stepped away...

578
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:11,024
I'll put some fruit on my head
and join a conga line.

579
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,776
I believe you looked for the bracelet.

580
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:15,153
While I am shaking it
to the Miami Sound Machine...

581
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:19,783
the phones here, they would ring and ring,
and no one to answer, no one to assist.

582
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,201
Okay. Bye.

583
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,037
It's a very quiet street...

584
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,290
and the owner keeps
the building up beautifully.

585
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:28,333
He hasn't remodeled it at all.

586
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:32,462
Plus, I bet he could be persuaded
to give the floor a little spruce if you like.

587
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,506
- We'd like a spruce.
- Spruce is unnecessary.

588
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,091
Never turn down a spruce.

589
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,594
- She's right. Listen to her.
- Yeah, listen to me.

590
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:41,638
- You rarely give me a choice.
- Come here so I can lick your face.

591
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,725
I went over the square footage
and the details of the lease...

592
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:47,311
with your husband this morning.
Did he fill you in?

593
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:51,523
- What? No...
- He didn't, but you know how men are.

594
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,358
The minute that ball game comes on...

595
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,903
all the realities of life
just go right out the window.

596
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:56,987
Don't I know it.

597
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,239
I could answer the door wrapped
in cellophane...

598
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:02,826
but unless I was wearing a Yankees cap,
he wouldn't even notice.

599
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,579
Don't be embarrassed, snuffy.
I'm just teasing.

600
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:06,788
It'd be a Mets cap.

601
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:11,084
Mary, could you possibly
leave me and little missus alone...

602
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,377
for just a minute?

603
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:15,297
- Of course.
- I promise we won't do anything dirty.

604
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:18,300
If my husband and I looked
anything like the two of you...

605
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:19,510
we'd never get dressed.

606
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:20,886
You are bad.

607
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:23,096
Let me leave
this rental agreement with you...

608
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,890
in case you decide to fill it out.

609
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,183
Thanks.

610
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,519
I hope you take it.

611
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,939
It's got a great vibe
for a nice couple like you two.

612
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,817
- Thirteen shades of red.
- What is wrong with you?

613
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,778
- You make it too easy.
- By standing here?

614
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,738
Relax, snuffy. What do you think?

615
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,073
She used the word 'vibe. '

616
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,658
- About the apartment?
- I don't know.

617
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:44,535
Break it down. List your concerns.

618
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,870
- It's too big.
- It's not too big. Next.

619
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,414
- I don't need two bathrooms.
- Yes, you do. Next.

620
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,042
- I like being on the bottom floor.
- Top floor's quieter.

621
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,587
I think this would be easier
if you listed your concerns first.

622
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,632
- I don't have any. It's great.
- You do?

623
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:02,636
Yeah, it's light and airy,
it's got good windows...

624
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:05,514
but not too many so that the sun
bakes you in the afternoon.

625
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:06,557
Thank you.

626
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,433
It's close to work, the price is good...

627
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,853
you're taking the spruce,
and it's a two-year lease.

628
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:13,188
- I don't know.
- You need to do this.

629
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:15,482
You and Jess will kill each other
in your place.

630
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:18,360
But who knows
how long he's gonna be here?

631
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,029
- Why? Did something happen?
- No, but you never know.

632
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:24,032
I think his mom sending his stuff
is a pretty good sign.

633
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,410
Even if he stays,
it'll only be for another year...

634
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:30,205
and then he'll go off to college or Attica,
and it'll just be me again.

635
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,375
I'll be stuck in a new apartment,
probably with neighbors I hate...

636
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,962
who are constantly cooking
really strong-smelling food.

637
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,088
Back up here.

638
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,424
Yes, Jess may go off
somewhere someday...

639
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:43,010
but that doesn't mean
you will be alone forever.

640
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:46,305
- I am not getting a pet.
- I'm talking about a lady friend.

641
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,849
- A red-hot mama.
- Okay.

642
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:52,477
Big, pretty dish of loving
with a spoon made especially for you.

643
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,688
Boy, do I not feel good now.

644
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:58,233
Luke, RacheI's not the only woman
in the world for you.

645
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:01,820
You'll meet someone someday,
probably at a Timberland store.

646
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:04,448
You'll ask her out, you'll pick her up...

647
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,534
take her on a patented
'Luke Danes night of romance. '

648
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:09,286
Juice bar, then the batting cages...

649
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:11,497
and then you'll ask her back
to your apartment.

650
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,290
Any amount of money if you stop now.

651
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:18,003
You'll bring her back to your place,
lead her upstairs to the apartment door.

652
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,298
You pause, gaze into her eyes.

653
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:24,343
The stage is set. Fate is waiting.

654
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:29,348
You open the door, and she sees
your teeny, tiny apartment...

655
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:32,851
one room and no closet space,
and Jess' feet sticking up in the air...

656
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:35,312
- 'cause you never got rid of the body...
- Stop, please.

657
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,981
To make matters worse, she spots it...

658
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,108
the single bed!

659
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:41,318
What's wrong with that?

660
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,945
- You know what they say.
- What?

661
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:44,988
Never, ever date a guy
who owns a single bed.

662
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,657
It means he's not open to commitment.

663
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,284
It says, 'There's no room in this life
for anybody else. '

664
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,495
It says, 'No room in this bed
for anybody else. '

665
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,872
- That's not much better.
- This discussion is over.

666
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:57,000
As long as you're in that apartment,
you'll have a single bed.

667
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,753
Don't you want the possibility of more?

668
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,340
Come on, Luke, it's time.
Make a move, take a shot.

669
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:06,051
Entertain the possibility
of a non-Unabomber existence.

670
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,719
What do you say?

671
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,347
- You got a pen?
- Of course.

672
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:14,601
- I'm not taking the spruce.
- Yes, you are.

673
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,703
- Did you get lost?
- No, I was looking at Rory's books.

674
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:36,456
I wanted to see if she had
Franny and Zooey. She does.

675
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,709
- Okay.
- I was gonna get it for her if she didn't.

676
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,086
- That's very nice of you.
- Yeah.

677
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,133
Okay. I should probably get back to work.

678
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:04,776
Luke! Good.

679
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,070
I was on my way
to the diner to talk to you.

680
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:08,489
Go on over. I'll meet you there.

681
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:10,782
Stop it. This isn't gonna make you mad.

682
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:13,410
I just have a couple of questions
about your application.

683
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:15,954
- I called your bank.
- What application?

684
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:19,291
Your application for the apartment.
You have two accounts...

685
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,461
- How did you get my application?
- Mary gave it to me.

686
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,004
I'm assuming one of the accounts...

687
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,298
Why would Mary give you my application?

688
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:27,549
Because I own the building.

689
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,259
When did you buy an apartment building?

690
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:31,386
I bought this one about two months ago.

691
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,847
I look at a thousand apartments,
I choose yours. How?

692
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:35,724
Count yourself lucky.

693
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:39,186
With me as the owner,
there is a level of quality control...

694
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:40,896
that is sorely lacking in this town.

695
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,940
For example, at all my properties...

696
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:46,151
we measure the grass before,
during, and after mowing...

697
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,612
to attain a perfect 1.5- Inch height...

698
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,989
which is pleasing to the eye
and good for the grass.

699
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:52,324
All of your properties?

700
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:53,575
Ten in all.

701
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,244
What, are you buying up the town?

702
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,371
Not yet, but someday, who knows?

703
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:58,956
Why isn't anyone stopping you?

704
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,958
Because people are lazy...

705
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,169
they don't want to think
about the proper fabric for an awning...

706
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,255
or the correct historical color
for a building.

707
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,383
They just slap any old thing up on a wall
and sleep like babies.

708
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:12,469
But soon, hopefully,
the city council will put an end to that.

709
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:15,180
You can't tell people
what color to paint their buildings.

710
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,348
Someone has to.

711
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,475
No, we don't live in a fascist country.

712
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:21,478
This isn't about the fascists,
who, by the way...

713
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,064
had their faults,
but their parks were spotless.

714
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,066
I have to get out of here.

715
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,401
Wait a minute.

716
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:31,029
Hold it! I still need to talk to you.

717
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:33,198
Just tear up the application.
I'm not moving.

718
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:35,742
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm a 2-inch-grass kind of guy.

719
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:38,537
That's too bad.
I need to talk to you about something else.

720
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,415
I'm thinking of buying
the flower shop next to the diner...

721
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:44,209
but we need to talk
about that sign of yours.

722
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:45,627
What about my sign?

723
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:48,881
You never took down
the 'Williams Hardware' sign.

724
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,257
That was my father's sign.

725
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,676
I understand you have
a sentimental attachment...

726
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:54,595
to the sign, but it confuses the tourists.

727
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:55,846
Back off the sign.

728
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,933
If I buy the building next to that sign,
I run the risk of people being so busy...

729
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:02,811
trying to figure out
if you sell hammers or burgers...

730
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:06,106
that they never notice
the nice collectible-plate store next door.

731
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,234
- Collectible plates?
- Isn't that a great idea?

732
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:12,613
Elvis, The Beatles, Mary Poppins.
All the greats!

733
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:15,991
You can hang them on the wall,
or buy a little stand and set them up...

734
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:20,078
You need to get away from me now.
At least a good arm-swinging length away.

735
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,080
It's people like you who keep this town...

736
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,625
from becoming
one of the great towns in America!

737
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:25,876
Arm-swinging length!

738
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:29,087
I wouldn't have approved
your application anyway.

739
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,311
- You look good.
- I'm fine.

740
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,104
Talk.

741
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:49,107
I lost my bracelet.

742
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,819
- Dean gave it to me.
- How thoughtful.

743
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:53,612
I've been all over town looking for it.

744
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,823
I've been to Lane's, I've been to Luke's...

745
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:58,450
I've been to the bus stop,
I've been to Miss Patty's...

746
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,828
and I've circled Stars Hollow twice,
and nothing.

747
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:03,163
I have no idea what I'm going to do.

748
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:05,415
- It's really that big a deal?
- What do you mean?

749
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:08,252
I know it's got
an 'I've been pinned, Bye Bye Birdie'...

750
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:11,004
kind of implication to it,
but it was just a bracelet.

751
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,923
I don't think Dean will see it that way.

752
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,758
You didn't lose it on purpose.

753
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,095
I know, but things have been
a little weird between us lately...

754
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,555
and you couldn't care less.

755
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,098
Yes, I could.

756
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:23,934
I just think Dean
will read something into this.

757
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:25,519
- Should he?
- No.

758
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,981
I think you should keep looking.

759
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:30,691
- Where?
- Anywhere.

760
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,443
Things you lose
are usually in front of your face.

761
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,654
- Check the house again.
- I've checked the house.

762
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,447
It's probably laying in your room.

763
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,449
I tore that room apart. It's not there.

764
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:43,328
Fine. Give up. No biggie.
Dean will just have to get over it.

765
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,373
I'll go look again.

766
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,170
You do that.

767
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:56,258
Where have you been?

768
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,385
Scouring the town.

769
00:36:58,594 --> 00:37:00,470
- Nothing?
- Not yet.

770
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:02,097
I'm gonna check my room again.

771
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:04,683
Haven't you looked in there 1,000 times?

772
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,518
A thousand and one.

773
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,188
Mom, come here, hurry.

774
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:11,190
Rory? Are you okay?

775
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:14,526
- I found it!
- What?

776
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,487
I looked under the bed, and there it was.

777
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:18,280
I thought I had looked under the bed...

778
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:20,407
but I don't know,
maybe I was too panicked.

779
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:21,617
Who cares? I got it.

780
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,162
- That is amazing!
- Put it on. Make it tight.

781
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,039
I'm cutting off circulation here, baby.

782
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:29,583
Look at it. It looks even better than before.

783
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,543
I think the time away from home
did it good.

784
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,712
- When I return, we celebrate.
- Where you going?

785
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,215
To tell Lane she can stop praying.

786
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:57,736
- Leaving?
- Yeah, all done.

787
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,863
You weren't gonna come get your money?

788
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,323
I figured I'd get it eventually.

789
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,242
I know where you guys live.

790
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:05,828
You certainly do know where we live.

791
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:07,830
Here.

792
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,292
After all, you earned it.

793
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,378
Thanks.

794
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,421
You took it, didn't you?

795
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:17,548
Excuse me?

796
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:19,800
Rory's bracelet. You had it the whole time.

797
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:21,426
No idea what you're talking about.

798
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,762
- How'd you get it?
- I didn't get anything.

799
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,472
Did you break into our house?

800
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:28,058
You dressed in black,
and pulled a Mission: Lmpossible?

801
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,352
I came down the chimney
and pulled a Santa Claus.

802
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:31,436
Very funny.

803
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,772
A ridiculous accusation
deserved such a response.

804
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:37,025
It's just a coincidence I catch you
coming out of Rory's room...

805
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,487
a half an hour before she mysteriously
finds the bracelet under her bed?

806
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,364
- Guess so.
- Why would you do this?

807
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,407
I gotta go.

808
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,951
I know you hate the world,
but I thought you liked Rory.

809
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,536
- I didn't do anything.
- Bull.

810
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:48,579
Whatever.

811
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:49,955
Don't 'whatever' me, you jerk.

812
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,040
You let Rory run around
completely panicked...

813
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:54,960
thinking she lost the bracelet.
She was miserable. Understand?

814
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:56,044
I didn't take it.

815
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:58,422
You're jealous of Dean
because he's great...

816
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,340
and Rory's madly in love with him.

817
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:03,260
But you taking the bracelet
didn't hurt Dean, it hurt Rory.

818
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:05,554
That bracelet is the most precious thing
she owns.

819
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,973
She never takes it off.
It means everything to her.

820
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,100
And you stealing it was unbelievably cruel.

821
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,144
- The most precious thing she owns?
- Yes!

822
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:14,438
If it's the most precious thing she owns...

823
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:17,774
why did it take her two weeks
to figure out it was gone?

824
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,652
You might want to reevaluate
how madly in love she is.

825
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,154
I wouldn't call him 'son' yet.

826
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:24,740
- Get out of here.
- You read my mind.

827
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,895
I just spent $100,000,
and it's all your fault!

828
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:57,523
Good.

829
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:00,108
I ran into Taylor at the market.

830
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:03,111
I found out he owns the building
that apartment was in.

831
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:04,279
No way.

832
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:06,532
- That and several others in town.
- So weird.

833
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,367
He's systematically buying up the town.

834
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:11,495
He'll turn it into Taylorville,
where everyone wears cardigans...

835
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:13,956
- and have the same grass height.
- Do you want to sit?

836
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,583
Then he said he'll buy the building
next to the diner...

837
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:17,835
turn it into a plate shop...

838
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:20,379
for freaks who don't have
the brainpower to collect stamps!

839
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,839
- I lost it!
- I can't picture it.

840
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,800
I walked around in a blind rage.
I was crazy.

841
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:28,220
I bought a Belgian waffle
with ice cream dipped in chocolate.

842
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,222
- You ate that?
- No, I didn't eat it.

843
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:31,765
I'm upset, not suicidal.

844
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:34,935
I had to do something.
I had your voice going round in my head.

845
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,687
It's like the Small World song.

846
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,731
'Take a chance, Luke. Make a move.
Can't have a single bed. '

847
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:41,817
So I bought the building!

848
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,860
You what?

849
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:44,695
Went to the bank, got a cashier's check...

850
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,780
signed the papers,
and I bought the building.

851
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:49,741
I am the building's owner.
I own the building.

852
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:52,327
Okay, don't worry,
you can still get out of it.

853
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:54,246
You can tell them you lost your mind.

854
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:57,291
- Or I bet you could sell it to Taylor.
- Yeah.

855
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:01,295
Relax. You can still get out of this,
unless you don't want to get out of this.

856
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:05,257
No, I want to get out of this.
Why would I not want to get out of this?

857
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,385
Owning that building
gives you some options.

858
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,220
Like?

859
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:13,223
Like you could expand Luke's
if you wanted to.

860
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,935
Or you could rent it to someone else.

861
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:20,189
Someone else
who might drive Taylor crazy.

862
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:21,565
I should think about this.

863
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,151
- Sure, sleep on it.
- Right.

864
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:27,279
- Do you want some tea?
- Tea's good. Sure. Yeah.

865
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:37,414
Does Jess ever talk to you about Rory?

866
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:38,874
What do you mean?

867
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:42,169
They seem to be thrown together
quite a lot lately.

868
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:45,297
I was trying to figure out
if that's a coincidence...

869
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,925
Or if there's something going on?
I don't know.

870
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:50,802
- Jess doesn't exactly confide in me.
- Right.

871
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,388
If there was something on,
I think it'd be great.

872
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:54,431
You do?

873
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:58,268
Yeah! Rory's a great kid.
She'd be really good for Jess.

874
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:00,062
Yeah, she would.

875
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:01,897
You think there may be
something going on?

876
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,440
I don't know.

877
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:05,484
Boy, that would be great.

878
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:08,779
Yeah. Great.

879
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:42,688
That's your room. Finish up.

880
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,357
We'll hold hands and skip afterwards.
