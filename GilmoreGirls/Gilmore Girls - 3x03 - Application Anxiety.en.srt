1
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:05,296
- This is sublime. 
- It was the golden age of television.

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:07,434
The music, the costumes, the sets.

3
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:09,822
All cylinders were fired on this one, boy!

4
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:11,880
And who knew that they all had such musical talent?

5
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:14,875
And such far out booty shaking abilities, as well.

6
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:16,698
- Mail, ladies. 
- Thanks, Eddie!

7
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:22,197
Did you see that TV Guide had this on their list of the worst fifty shows of all time?

8
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:25,474
- I know! Who are they to judge? 
- I know, it’s on my top fifty best.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,583
Yeah, right after "Holmes and Yoyo" and "Hee Haw Honeys."

10
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:31,618
Oh, Rory, get back here! They’re in clown suits and headed for the pool.

11
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:32,546
Oh my God.

12
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:34,194
- Honey, come here. 
- It’s here.

13
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:35,961
- What’s here? 
- My application to Harvard.

14
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:37,307
Oh my God.

15
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:42,985
- It’s beautiful. 
- Impressive letterage, huh?

16
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:44,311
Oh, yeah, it’s so...

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,989
- Very. 
- Can I hold it?

18
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:48,034
Be careful.

19
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,945
- Oh, it’s heavy, heavy with importance. 
- I feel dizzy.

20
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:55,474
Are you sure that’s not just the sight of Robert Reed in the tight clown pants?

21
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:58,854
Oh, geez. Let the record show that when my application to Harvard arrived,

22
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:02,172
- we were watching "The Brady Bunch Variety Hour." 
- You don’t lose points for that, do you?

23
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:05,568
I hope not. Man, this morning I was reading Dead Souls – it couldn’t have come then?

24
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,647
Well, we’ll just tell people that’s what you were doing, and that I was studying a really big globe.

25
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:11,271
- They’ll never know. 
- You can keep a secret?

26
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:15,035
- Not so far, but there’s always a first. 
- Dead Souls and a really big globe.

27
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:15,762
Deal.

28
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:17,528
Oh, kayaks!

29
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:20,252
- Come on, come on, I wanna get started. 
- Hold your horses there little Miss Horsie Holder.

30
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:23,196
They’re going to expect a higher level of wit when you’re at Harvard.

31
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:25,931
- Oh, watch that drink. 
- I’m nowhere near it.

32
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:29,284
Well, keep it that way. This is an uncontaminated area.

33
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:33,309
I even cleaned the table using something other than the sleeve of my sweater and spit.

34
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,842
- Lovely image. I’ll be careful. 
- All right, here we go. First question.

35
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:40,698
- Oh my God. 
- What?

36
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,465
"What were you doing the moment you received this application?" counts for fifty percent of your eligibility.

37
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:45,218
Stop.

38
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:47,712
- I need help. 
- With what?

39
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,668
She’s writing her drummer-seeks-rock-band ad.

40
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,787
And it’s not reading right to me. Could you guys look it over?

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,813
Let’s see – "Drummer with strong beat seeks band into the Accelerators, the Adolescents, the Adverts,

42
00:02:57,864 --> 00:03:01,732
Agent Orange, the Angelic Upstarts, the Agnostic Front, Ash..." You went alphabetically.

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,826
- Seemed tidy. 
- And a little OCD.

44
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,444
- And a little long. 
- I can’t make cuts.

45
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:08,419
- It’s three pages, single spaced – make cuts. 
- But this is the cut-down version.

46
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:13,027
I mean, just from the letter A, I excluded AC/DC, the Animals, and A-Ha, footnoted as a guilty pleasure.

47
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:15,280
- If we can’t get through it, no one can. 
- Okay.

48
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:17,124
I’ll try to make cuts, but no guarantees.

49
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:21,471
Okay, personal information... state your full name. Better not get that one wrong.

50
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,375
- I’ll try. 
- And nickname, if any.

51
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:25,521
- That would be Rory. 
- Or Droopy Drawers.

52
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:28,208
- That was never my nickname. 
- Wrong, I called you that as a baby.

53
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:29,381
- What? 
- That’s right.

54
00:03:29,473 --> 00:03:33,232
You had these little OshKosh cords and they were way too big and once at the mall,

55
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:36,063
they fell right down to your knees and I said, "Whoa, there, Droopy Drawers!" –

56
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:40,170
and I’m just afraid if we don’t answer everything accurately, the Harvard police will come

57
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:42,704
and hit you with an atlas and say something mean in Latin.

58
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,528
How would they know that you called me Droopy Drawers?

59
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,641
Well, we could be at a Harvard event and I could slip up and say,

60
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:51,712
"Pass me a lobster puff, Droopy Drawers," and they could hear me, and that’ll be that.

61
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:53,801
How ‘bout you don’t drink at any of these Harvard events?

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,408
Okay, parental information. Mother – breathtaking.

63
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,873
I think they just want your name.

64
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:02,147
Father – ostracized.

65
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:06,576
- Personal statement. 
- Oh, the essay, the big kahuna.

66
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:09,371
You can evaluate a significant experience that’s had an impact on you.

67
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:10,983
How ‘bout that time your drawers dropped at the mall? 

68
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:12,183
Enough with the drawers.

69
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:15,398
Or you can write about a person who has had a significant influence on you.

70
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:18,250
- You? 
- Or one of your authors, Faulkner or...

71
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:20,397
- Or Sylvia Plath. 
- Might send the wrong message.

72
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:22,481
- The sticking her head in the oven thing? 
- Yeah.

73
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:26,176
Although she did make her kids a snack first, shows a certain maternal instinct.

74
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,268
Okay, I just crunched the numbers and at two thousand words and twenty-five cents a word,

75
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:32,377
this stupid ad’s gonna cost five hundred dollars!

76
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,878
That’s five months worth of Minwaxing end tables at my mom’s store. I give up.

77
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:40,309
No, don’t give up. Just cut down your influences to the most important ones, like with David Bowie.

78
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:43,523
- Gotta have Bowie. 
- But do you have to list every album he ever recorded

79
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:45,925
- plus your personal rating between one to ten? 
- Maybe not.

80
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:47,620
And what’s with Jackson Browne making the list?

81
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:50,667
Ah, see, cool people know that he’s more than a mellow hippie-dippy folkie,

82
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:54,103
that he actually wrote some of Nico’s best songs and was in fact her lover

83
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:58,184
before he bored us with "Doctor My Eyes." That will separate the poseurs from the non-poseurs.

84
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,482
- Wax on, wax off. 
- I hate this.

85
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:03,642
- Okay, what activities interest you? 
- All of them except for the sports.

86
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:06,847
- I thought you were the lacrosse kid. 
- Mom, just a modicum of seriousness

87
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:11,168
- as we do this would be much appreciated. 
- So, circle all of them except sports.

88
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:16,037
Oh, they want a picture. How about the one of us sticking our heads through the carved out holes

89
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:20,344
- of Johnny Bravo and SpongeBob Squarepants? 
- There’s the seriousness I crave.

90
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,333
I’m going to have to crank the Ramones if I have to make deep cuts.

91
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:32,141
- We’ll move outside. 
- The outside’s contaminated.

92
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:41,367
- Thank you. 
- Do they let kids drink coffee before school?

93
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:43,339
Why, do you think it might lead to harder stuff?

94
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:45,582
- Lattes, cappucinos... 
- Forget I asked.

95
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:49,392
- So, what are you doing Saturday? 
- Just my usual chores.

96
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:52,837
- Your usual chores, John-boy? 
- Well, what else do you call house jobs?

97
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:56,964
I call them the stuff you avoid until the Environmental Protection Agency steps in.

98
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:59,365
- Why do you ask? 
- I thought we could see a movie or something.

99
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,774
- You’re not free. 
- How do you know?

100
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,720
‘Cause you’ll be working on your application all weekend.

101
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,898
- No, I’m not. 
- Really?

102
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:06,760
It’s not due for weeks, and I already have my essay topic picked out.

103
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:09,083
- Which is? 
- Hillary Clinton.

104
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:10,819
- Sounds perfect. 
- I know.

105
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,450
She’s so smart and tough and nobody thought she could win New York

106
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:17,215
but she did and she’s doing amazing, and have you heard her speak?

107
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:20,615
Only when you’ve played me the thousands of hours of C-SPAN footage you taped.

108
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:23,764
She’s a great speaker, strong and persuasive

109
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:26,574
with a wonderful presence, and even those suits of hers are getting better.

110
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,602
- I’d include that in the essay. 
- Anyhow, now that I have Hillary,

111
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:32,621
- all I need is a date for Saturday. Suggestions? 
- You’re on.

112
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:35,535
Great. Oh, there’s my bus. Sip.

113
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:38,154
Kiss.

114
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:40,749
- And bye. 
- Bye.

115
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:47,334
- Fast runner. 
- It’s the coffee.

116
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:48,844
- Not your face? 
- Excuse me?

117
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,978
Sorry, just missed my youth for a second. I’m back. Coffee?

118
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:11,884
Everyone always says that! This is my speaking voice. This is its natural volume! Fine, fine!

119
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:15,137
- Short-sighted morons. 
- What now, Paris?

120
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,292
We went to all this trouble to set up this stupid seminar.

121
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:21,617
I say we, but let’s face it, I did most of the work, and Mr. Hunter won’t let me do it the way I want.

122
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,070
The panelists are up there. We sit across from them and ask questions. What’s the problem?

123
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:28,208
It’s boring and predictable and done to death. I wanted Charlie Rose.

124
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,867
- To ask the questions? 
- His style.

125
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:32,258
I wanted us sitting at a round table with black backdrops.

126
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,822
But the audience won’t be able to see anything.

127
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,528
I was working with the losers in the AV club to project it on a giant video screen.

128
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:41,117
And all Mr. Hunter said was, "Paris, this isn’t the Beatles at Shea Stadium."

129
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:44,645
Nice anachronism, huh? Like they had video screens in sixty-three.

130
00:07:44,753 --> 00:07:46,954
His references are as topical as his suits.

131
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,959
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please? We can get this seminar started.

132
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:53,811
I’d like to bring up the organizers of this little event, Paris Gellar and Rory Gilmore.

133
00:07:58,424 --> 00:07:59,662
Thank you, Mr. Hunter.

134
00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:04,338
Everybody, this is a seminar called "The Business of Getting In."

135
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:07,265
Its goal is to help guide us through the torturous process of applying to, 

136
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:09,765
and getting into, the right college.

137
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:13,917
My panelists are Jim Romaine, admissions officer at Princeton University,

138
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,077
and Ivy-League college consultant, Rose Samuels.

139
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,084
- Welcome, panel. 
- Yes, welcome.

140
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:25,762
Now, panel, you’re addressing a group of kids just beginning the stressful process of applying to college.

141
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:32,777
Question : what is the biggest mistake a person can make on his or her application? Mr. Romaine?

142
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:36,172
Well, forgetting to send it in would be the worst mistake,

143
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:39,425
- but perfunctory answers would be high on my list. 
- Explain.

144
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,746
I’m talking about run of the mill responses, a lack of originality, particularly in the essay category.

145
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:50,830
If I read one more over-adulating piece of prose about Hillary Clinton and her profound influence,

146
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:53,243
- my head will explode. 
- I hear that.

147
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:57,770
Sometimes a mistake like that comes from writing what one thinks an admission officer wants to read.

148
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,111
- Big mistake. 
- And sometimes it’s just a lack of original thought.

149
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,467
- Just as big a mistake. 
- Personal anecdote :

150
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:08,603
when I was twelve and I was writing the first of my trial essays in practice for the day I’d write my real essay,

151
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:13,893
I chose Hillary Clinton. Then I realized every braindead bint in a skirt would be writing about Hillary,

152
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:17,303
but it was good to clear the pipes. Now, what are some other mistakes?

153
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:21,465
Well, small thing, but if your printing is bad, that says something we don’t like.

154
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:26,735
If your extracurriculars and volunteer activities are too by-the-book, that says something we don’t like.

155
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:31,743
Yes, those activities should have a personality behind them – a focus, a direction.

156
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,167
I’ve seen applications where the student has circled every activity listed.

157
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:38,884
Again, you’re trying too hard there. One can’t be interested in everything.

158
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:42,505
They’re the ones who’ve had college paraphernalia on their walls their whole lives.

159
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:44,528
Too hungry, it’s a little immature.

160
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,832
Interesting, interesting.

161
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:49,606
Rory, do you wanna ask a question?

162
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:51,696
- No. 
- What?

163
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,609
- No, thank you. 
- Okay.

164
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:58,720
So, how early should a student get an application in?

165
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:01,337
By the due date. Earlier makes no difference.

166
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:04,851
It’s a complete myth that there’s a benefit to be derived from early admission.

167
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:07,630
I do think it’s important to talk about the interview process.

168
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:11,198
I believe it’s an opportunity to weed out the hyper-intense candidate...

169
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:13,845
- So, she’s meeting you here? 
- Yeah, she had a thing after school,

170
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,560
- a rumble or something. She said she’d be over after. 
- A rumble?

171
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:20,559
Yeah, a bunch of kids meet in an alley, they pirouette, they pull knives, it’s a whole to-do.

172
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:23,549
- So she’s meeting you here? 
- Yes, she’s meeting us here.

173
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,260
- Where’s Dad? 
- The magazines.

174
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,711
That was weird... and unresponsive.

175
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:34,240
These are college issues of various magazines. I’ve been collecting them for a couple of months now.

176
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:36,571
Oh, well, Rory’s probably seen all those, but thanks anyway.

177
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:37,723
- Have you read these? 
- No.

178
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:41,220
Well, you should. I’ve unearthed some shocking statistics.

179
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,701
I mean, do you have any idea how hot the competition is to get into a school like Harvard?

180
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:49,038
Well, yeah, it’s very hot. It’s one of the top schools in the country.

181
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:52,470
In the world. People from China, Russia, India,

182
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:56,540
children from every country apply to Harvard. There’s more competition than ever before.

183
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:58,159
Really, Mom, I know all this.

184
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:03,319
With the dot-com bust and the job market dwindling and the stock market going up and down like a yo-yo,

185
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,437
everyone and his brother knows the best chance for success 

186
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:08,337
and financial security is not just to go to college,

187
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,446
- but to go to a top college. 
- Thank you, got it, appreciate the info.

188
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:16,796
Every child that applies has the same high grade point average, they’ve taken the same AP classes,

189
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:19,705
- and they’re all on the student council. 
- They’re not all that identical.

190
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:24,344
One college admissions officer said that he sometimes puts a random stack of applications

191
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:28,097
in the yes pile and the rest in the no pile because he knows it doesn’t make any difference.

192
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:31,656
- He doesn’t even so much as glance at them. 
- That does not sound real.

193
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:35,381
And now it’s the in thing for young Hollywood celebrities to go to universities.

194
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:39,146
- What do they call themselves, the Brat Pack? 
- About a hundred years ago.

195
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:42,054
They get into wherever they want based on name recognition.

196
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:46,612
I was watching TV and that insipid Kate Hudson was talking about going to a university.

197
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:51,609
If she decides to go to Harvard, she’ll get right in over Rory, who we know is more qualified.

198
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:54,103
How ‘bout a drink, Mom? You want a drink, ‘cause I sure do.

199
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:56,761
Lorelai, hold on here. What are we gonna do about this?

200
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,883
Look, there is no we, okay? It’s me – me and Rory – that’s the we.

201
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:06,268
I appreciate your concern and your prodigious research, but it’s all gonna be fine. Rory’s special.

202
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,719
Well, you know that and I know that but those idiots at Harvard may not necessarily know that.

203
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:13,134
- Hello? 
- We’re in here, honey, and hurry!

204
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:15,958
- Hi Grandma. 
- Hello Rory. You look flushed.

205
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:19,358
I ran from the bus stop, I’m okay. Mom, hey, I’ve been trying to call you –

206
00:12:19,444 --> 00:12:21,236
- can I talk to you for a second? 
- Is something wrong?

207
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:23,858
No, I just need to talk to Mom about something, that’s all. We’ll be quick.

208
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,096
Okay, hon. We’ll be back.

209
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:28,159
- I’m not getting into Harvard. 
- What? Who says?

210
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,842
Well, I’m completely unprepared, and I have no original thoughts!

211
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:34,247
No, no, don’t blame yourself, it’s not you. It’s those jerks at Harvard –

212
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:35,363
- I hate them! 
- What?

213
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:39,378
Well, apparently, it doesn’t matter how qualified you are, those lazy-ass admissions officers

214
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,299
just take applications and stick it in the yes and no piles without even glancing at them!

215
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:47,672
Well, it won’t matter because my Hillary Clinton essay will be just like every other girl’s Hillary Clinton essay

216
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:50,320
because apparently that’s all we can think of. I’m such a hack.

217
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:53,454
Is it true everyone has the same GPA? How is that possible?

218
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:58,119
Because we all take the same classes and we all give the same perfunctory run-of-the-mill responses.

219
00:12:58,184 --> 00:13:00,673
And I’m interested in too many things, I have to limit them.

220
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:04,892
I’m gonna circle travel on my application. From now on, that is what I am interested in, travel.

221
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,759
No, no, don’t do that, no! Because all those people coming from China and India

222
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:12,241
and God knows where else, they’re all nuts for traveling – that’s why they’re traveling here!

223
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:15,748
And jobs are dropping and dot-com bombing and something’s acting like a yo-yo, I don’t know what

224
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:18,682
but it’s not good! And over my dead body is Kate Hudson getting your spot, 

225
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:19,982
let me just say that right now!

226
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,825
- Mom, you’re freaking out! 
- Yes, I’m freaking out!

227
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,875
Well, you can’t freak out, I’m freaking out!

228
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:27,227
- Hello? 
- What the hell did Romaine mean

229
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:30,044
when he was going on about weeding out the hyper-intense in the interview process?

230
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,708
He stopped just short of calling me by name, I’m losing it! 

231
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,958
- Not now, Paris.
- I tried to throw the questioning over to you

232
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:36,327
because I was about to heave and you left me hanging

233
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:38,790
- so I had to come home and heave. 
- I’ll talk to you tomorrow, Paris.

234
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:40,837
- Wait! 
- Okay, we gotta calm down here.

235
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,122
- So, set an example. 
- Hey, I’m human, too.

236
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:46,403
- My forehead is burning up. 
- My heart is beating so fast, it’s gotta slow down.

237
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,096
- Okay, just... let’s take a breath. 
- Okay.

238
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:53,003
- This freaking out is not good. 
- It sucks.

239
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:55,002
We can do this. If others can do this, we can do this!

240
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:57,683
- Well, I’m not so sure anymore. 
- That is unacceptable!

241
00:13:57,724 --> 00:13:59,526
- Well, I don’t wanna accept it. 
- Then we won’t.

242
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:01,113
- Well, what do we do? 
- I don’t know.

243
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:04,319
- We definitely need some sort of perspective. 
- I think we need therapy.

244
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:07,423
And booze! For those of us over twenty-one.

245
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:12,194
- Okay, are we calming? Are we less-freaked? 
- I’m totally freaked out.

246
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:13,433
- Well, hide it! 
- I can’t hide it.

247
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,344
Then prepare yourself for an evening of magazine recitations by Emily "DJ Doom-meister" Gilmore.

248
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,722
I’ll hide it.

249
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:31,856
Hello?

250
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,633
No, Lane should be here any minute. Is this about the ad?

251
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,159
Well, give me your number and she’ll call you back.

252
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:42,661
Okay, then, what’s the number of the dude whose couch you’re sleeping on?

253
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,967
Dude doesn’t have a phone? Well, try back later, dude. Thanks.

254
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,127
Rory, are you up? If not, get up!

255
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:52,077
And where’s Lane? She’s supposed to be fielding these.

256
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:55,338
Hello? No, she’s not, may I take a message?

257
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,852
Oh, wait a minute – here she is, hold on.

258
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:00,341
Sorry. This is Lane.

259
00:15:00,796 --> 00:15:02,159
- Hey. 
- Hey.

260
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:04,816
- Aw, what’s up? 
- I didn’t sleep so well.

261
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:07,851
- Poor thing. 
- I’m fine. I’m just a little bummed.

262
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:11,452
No, wait, wait, wait, progressive rock is a really passé style now

263
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:16,296
but I listed it as an influence because it was a progenitor of great things that came afterwards.

264
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:17,909
I mean, I contend that you can draw a straight line 

265
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:21,779
from Yes to Jethro Tull to the Jam to Nirvana, bing bang boom...

266
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:24,262
Who are the Jam?

267
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:26,306
That’s disturbing.

268
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:31,708
Hey, maybe instead of going to college, you should drop out and I could quit my job

269
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,842
and we can form an all-girl band with Lane, you know, like Bananarama.

270
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:41,216
We could call it Tangerinarama or Banana-fana-fo-fana-rama... or something.

271
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:43,588
Honey, I’m just kidding, you gotta go to college.

272
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:47,254
I’m up for anything at this point. I gotta go. I’ll see you later?

273
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,117
- Feel better, okay? 
- I will.

274
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:54,846
You are not telling me that you did not know that Kim Deal was in the Pixies before the Breeders!

275
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:56,311
I refuse to accept that!

276
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,260
These kids have no sense of history.

277
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,879
- Hey Tom, what’s up? 
- Nothing much.

278
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:06,007
Why don’t you get me a ham on rye, mustard, no mayo. 

279
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,267
You got it.

280
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:08,220
Hi.

281
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,695
- You got money? 
- Yes, sir.

282
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:12,461
- What can I get ya? 
- Let’s see. How about a nice, cold egg cream?

283
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:15,225
- A what cream? 
- An egg cream. A nice and cold one.

284
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:15,866
What is that? 

285
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:17,766
It’s like milk and soda water with flavoring, isn’t it?

286
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,337
- You asking me? 
- Nice and cold.

287
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:21,083
- I heard that part. 
- Used to get ‘em at Coney Island.

288
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,245
Go to Coney Island, kid.

289
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,251
- Sir, can I get something to go? 
- You got money?

290
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:26,817
- What do you want? 
- A black cow.

291
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:29,526
- Aw, now, come on. 
- It’s just root beer and ice cream.

292
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:30,734
Root beer and ice cream?

293
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:31,538
Well, I can do that.

294
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:34,416
As long as the ice cream’s made the old fashioned way – on the premises.

295
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:35,680
Now wait a second.

296
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:38,245
- Hey, Luke, can you whip me up something in a hurry? 
- What, Kirk?

297
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,504
- A chocolate phosphate. 
- Okay, now, what the hell is this?

298
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:43,715
- Why do you want a phosphate? 
- Because nothing says refreshment like a phosphate.

299
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:46,285
- This is Taylor, right? Is he behind this? 
- I’m not at liberty to say.

300
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:49,593
Okay, then, you tell me. And remember, if you lie, you’ll go to hell.

301
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,764
- He didn’t say you’d get mad. 
- Come on.

302
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:01,732
- What is this? 
- That’s my question.

303
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,032
- Now what the hell’s going on here? 
- I have no idea what you’re talking about.

304
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,470
They’re asking for phosphates and egg creams and black cows,

305
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,891
and they already gave you up, so tell me what’s going on.

306
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:10,243
- Who finked? 
- Him, him.

307
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:11,333
- Snitch! 
- Well, you did.

308
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,249
It’s not the kid’s fault, Taylor. Now what is this about?

309
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:18,491
Well, you are so close-minded to new things, Luke, that I decided to make an admittedly desperate attempt

310
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:22,705
to convince you of the need for something that I think is a terrific idea.

311
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:26,494
- Which is? 
- An old fashioned, turn of the century soda shop!

312
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:30,207
- Aye yi yi yi yi! 
- It’s just the kind of wholesome hang

313
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:34,999
- today’s teens need to keep them off the streets. 
- And our streets are so wild and out of control?

314
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,220
If you ask me, yes – and I have proof.

315
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:42,111
- What are these? 
- Surveillance photos of town goings-on,

316
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:45,086
the dark side of Stars Hollow, Luke – not a pretty picture.

317
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,851
- These are kids on skateboards. 
- Slaloming around pop bottles

318
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,615
right down the middle of the street. I’m telling you, Luke, 

319
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:52,915
if we don’t quick furnish these skateboarding z-boys

320
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:56,991
with a moral distraction, they’re gonna turn Stars Hollow into Dogtown.

321
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:59,045
- This is the space next to the diner. 
- I know.

322
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:01,103
- I own the space next to the diner. 
- I know.

323
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:03,237
You wanna open the soda shop in the space next to the diner?

324
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,700
- It’s the only one that’s appropriate. 
- Taylor, no, no, no, no,

325
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:11,896
and every day from now on ‘til the end of my life, I am gonna come in here and say, "Taylor, no!"

326
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,769
And when I die, I’m gonna have them freeze me next to Ted Williams,

327
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:17,794
and when they find the cure to what I died of and they unfreeze me,

328
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:21,737
my first words are gonna be, "How’s Ted?" followed closely by, "Taylor, no!"

329
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,122
- But the space is empty! 
- Not for long.

330
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:27,468
- And what are your plans for it? 
- A skateboard and pop bottle shop.

331
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:28,414
That’s not funny.

332
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:31,400
With in-house experts to teach the craft of street slaloming.

333
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:33,884
- Still not funny. 
- Well, I’m not in a very funny mood!

334
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:37,948
Luke, are you taking applications for jobs at your skateboard and bottle shop?

335
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:39,803
Yeah, I’m interviewing people today, Kirk.

336
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:41,896
Great. Shall I go home and change or will casual suffice?

337
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:44,155
- I like the going home part. 
- I don’t understand.

338
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,041
- Hey. 
- Hey.

339
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:53,028
Guess who I actually had a very productive conversation with today? Headmaster Charleston.

340
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,317
- You’re kidding. 
- No, and I think we came up

341
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,109
with the solution to our application anxiety, 

342
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,809
- you wanna hear it? 
- I guess.

343
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:02,439
Well, we spent the first ten minutes on him bugging me to volunteer for more stuff at school,

344
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:06,417
or in lieu of that to make a donation to build the new basketball court, and then another couple of minutes

345
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,934
of me convincing him that what sounded like me going "Ha!" was really me clearing my throat,

346
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:13,478
but after that we had a very pleasant, productive conversation.

347
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,534
- And? 
- He suggested setting up a meeting

348
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:20,693
with a Harvard graduate, like a dinner or something. He even gave me the number of someone he knows.

349
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,726
- An alumni dinner? 
- Yes, exactly.

350
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:25,649
- Do they do that? 
- According to Charleston, it’s done all the time.

351
00:19:25,762 --> 00:19:30,376
Yeah, it would be an opportunity to talk with someone who’s been through it all and did it successfully.

352
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:33,812
You can ask questions, he can give some perspective, it seems perfect.

353
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,429
- It sounds a little weird. 
- Yeah, a little,

354
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:37,790
but I’ll go with you and what’s the worst that can happen?

355
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,102
We’re bored and we blow a meal, but if this person can help, then that’s a good thing, right?

356
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:44,435
I do have some questions... a lot of questions.

357
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:46,499
- Well, let’s call him. 
- Now?

358
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,686
Yes, yes, there’s no time like the present, come on.

359
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:54,374
His name is Darren Springsteen of Westport, Connecticut, Harvard class of 74.

360
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:57,293
- Ask if he has a brother named Bruce. 
- I’m not gonna ask him that.

361
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:00,540
It’s ringing.

362
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:04,339
- Why’d you hang up? 
- I’m not good at these things.

363
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:05,665
- Did he answer? 
- Yes.

364
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:09,069
Yes? Rory, that’s a really terrible first impression.

365
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,421
- Him? 
- Maybe.

366
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,642
- He star sixty-nined us? 
- Well, the Harvard people

367
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:16,949
can afford all the latest technology. Answer!

368
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:20,676
Hey, you’ve reached Suffragette City, and if you’re calling about Lane Kim’s ad, sorry we’re not in,

369
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:24,537
but don’t commit rock and roll suicide – just crank a message with some feedback.

370
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,857
- Oh geez. 
- Well, if he is related to Bruce, he can dig it.

371
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:29,605
Hey, my name’s Dave Rygalski, I’m calling about the ad. 

372
00:20:29,704 --> 00:20:32,505
I left my number before, so call when you get a chance.

373
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,159
- Where’s my... 
- Relax, I’m coming.

374
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,149
- Let’s try this again. 
- Can we please just do this later?

375
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:38,583
No, let’s get it done now.

376
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:41,496
- It’s ringing. 
- Let’s do it later.

377
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,816
- It’s ringing. 
- I’m gonna say the wrong thing

378
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:47,646
or have the wrong tone in my voice. I’m not in good first impression mode right now.

379
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:54,595
Hello? Hello, this is Rory Gilmore. I believe you were expecting my call...

380
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:58,864
Oh, well, this is such a wonderful opportunity for me...

381
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,111
- Whatever’s good for you will be great for me... 
- Not so breathy.

382
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:03,416
That’s how chickens talk!

383
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,876
Lunch? Oh yes, let me just check my organizer...

384
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,224
Oh, perfect. My mother will be there, too. She’s terrific...

385
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,629
All right, I’ll see you this weekend... Mm, bye.

386
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:18,261
- You’re no Danny Gans. 
- I never claimed to be.

387
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:21,466
He’s gonna be expecting Chilton High School senior Trixie McBimbo.

388
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:24,293
- And her mother, Bambi McBimbo. 
- But I guess it can’t hurt, right?

389
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:26,334
- It can only help. 
- Okay.

390
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:30,114
And look, if it’s a total bust, we’ll grab a pole and Trixie and Bambi’ll take it on the road.

391
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:32,423
That’s something to put on your application, huh? It’ll set you apart.

392
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:34,425
- Thanks Mom. 
- Bye Trixie!

393
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:41,322
- So, alumna is a girl graduate. 
- Right.

394
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,233
- And alumnus is a man. 
- Singular.

395
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:45,827
- So an unmarried man? 
- No, not not-married.

396
00:21:45,915 --> 00:21:51,011
He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural.

397
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:53,970
- And plural is alumni. 
- Right, and that can be girls and guys.

398
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,305
- Kinky! 
- No, not kinky, just what it is.

399
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:57,708
You’re no fun when you’re nervous.

400
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,432
Oh yes, because you and I usually have so much fun with Latin.

401
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,186
So what do we call this guy, alumnus Darren, you know, 

402
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:04,486
like you’d say farmer John or the butcher Lazar Wolf?

403
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:05,644
Hish-kabibble.

404
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:09,274
- Hello there. 
- Hello, I’m Lorelai Gilmore.

405
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:12,839
Darren Springsteen, nice to meet you. And this must be the reason we’re all here.

406
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,988
Yes, hello. I’m hope we’re not putting you out.

407
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:19,341
Putting us out? Today you are the Springsteen family’s raison d’être. Come in, come in.

408
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:22,546
- Was your drive long? 
- Not too.

409
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:26,811
Stars Hollow is charming. The last time we drove through there, there was a pumpkin patch.

410
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:28,204
- Sounds like us. 
- In March.

411
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:30,052
Oh, that would be the year the pumpkins arrived late.

412
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:33,114
Sounds like a Dr. Seuss book. You came bearing gifts?

413
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:39,283
What? Oh, this. No, this is not a gift. These are my records – grades, SATs.

414
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:42,106
It’s Rory in a bag – you add water and her brilliance springs out.

415
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:44,318
Why don’t I just glance at this some other time, mm?

416
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,747
This afternoon, why don’t we just talk and get to know one another, okay?

417
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:49,684
- Sounds good. 
- You’re a very nice alumni.

418
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:50,795
Thanks.

419
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:53,077
- That’s the plural. 
- Ah, rats!

420
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:58,663
- Lorelai, Rory, say hello to Marie, my wife. 
- Hello, so good to have you here.

421
00:22:58,757 --> 00:22:59,725
- Hi. 
- Thank you.

422
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:02,249
- How about drinks? Iced tea, water? 
- Iced tea’s good.

423
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:03,472
- Same here. 
- Okay.

424
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,419
- Do you like art, Rory? 
- Very much.

425
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:09,371
Modern painting is my passion. I’ve got a Hockney, a Kline –

426
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:12,976
what I don’t have is a Diebenkorn so please don’t ask, "Where’s the Diebenkorn?"

427
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:16,750
- Uh, you warned me just in time. 
- I only recently got into sculpture.

428
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:22,695
My latest acquisition, it’s a Zoltan Kemeny. Very provocative. Don’t you just love its audacity?

429
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:26,376
- Yes, it’s very audacious. 
- So, what are some of your other interests, Rory?

430
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:31,061
Oh, well, pull up a comfy chair there, Darren, because they are widespread and extensive.

431
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:34,656
- I read a lot. I’m into the Russians lately. 
- Tolstoy, Turgenev?

432
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,974
- Gogol is my thing right now – Dead Souls. 
- One of my favorites.

433
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:40,964
You were reading that when we got your Harvard application in the mail, weren’t you sweetie?

434
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:42,598
Yes, yes I was.

435
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:45,734
I saw that Harvard logo on the envelope and I said, 

436
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,034
"Rory, get your nose out of your Gogol and get over here!"

437
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:52,905
Of course, we have a TV somewhere, but it’s really more of a funny little table

438
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:54,553
to put a cup of chai tea on, you know what I mean?

439
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:56,912
I’m afraid I don’t. I watch way too many sports,

440
00:23:56,975 --> 00:23:59,371
and I go to all the Harvard games. How about you – do you like sports?

441
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,478
- Yes. 
- No.

442
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:02,966
That is, we follow certain things.

443
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,842
We enjoy various aspects of certain sporting endeavors.

444
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,089
But it wouldn’t be the kind that you could ask any follow-up questions on.

445
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:12,551
- It’s a general interest. 
- Got it.

446
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,168
It’s pretty much a waste of time, but it’s how I waste my time.

447
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:19,766
I collect memorabilia, too. I’ve got each year’s Harvard team pennant going back to 1927.

448
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:23,672
- Lots of displayed Harvard paraphernalia, huh? 
- It’s all over the walls at the rec room.

449
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:26,674
- See, see, lots of paraphernalia. 
- Watch the ribs there.

450
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:30,374
Ah, here are the kids. Jack, Jennifer, this is Lorelai and Rory.

451
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:31,895
- Hi there. 
- It’s nice to meet you.

452
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,093
- Likewise. 
- Hi.

453
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:37,057
Jack’s premed at Princeton and Jennifer is bound for Harvard like you Rory.

454
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:40,539
- Oh, we should talk. 
- Sure.

455
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,270
- If not today, another day, okay? 
- Okay.

456
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,618
- Do you wanna pick a time now or later... 
- Later’s fine.

457
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:48,434
- I’ll make a note in my palm pilot. 
- Cool.

458
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:50,636
- Here are your teas. 
- Thank you.

459
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,682
- Ah, Darren, we should really get the chicken going. 
- Right, right.

460
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:56,673
You’re getting my famous chicken today – I hope you like chicken.

461
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:58,172
- Love it. 
- I’ll be right back.

462
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:01,010
Here’s some of my Harvard yearbooks, peruse them if you like.

463
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:06,617
- Yeah, and we should go clean up, Jen. 
- Mm, definitely. I will see you in a jiff.

464
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,050
- What? 
- Did they just leave to take a shower together?

465
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:13,452
- Oh, gross! 
- What?

466
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,631
- They bounced in together, they bounced out together. 
- New topic.

467
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,280
- Can’t take gritty reality? 
- Or slanderous postulating.

468
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:21,609
And how is it they just came off the tennis court and they’re not even sweating?

469
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,601
I don’t know. Maybe when you’re that white, you don’t sweat.

470
00:25:23,707 --> 00:25:25,736
- Darren’s nice though, isn’t he? 
- He’s very nice.

471
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:28,327
- Hey, do you think I’m making a good impression? 
- Great impression.

472
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:30,704
He loves you, especially when he found out you share his love 

473
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:33,504
of various aspects of certain sporting endeavors.

474
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,848
Hey, you started it. We could have just told the truth and said we weren’t into sports.

475
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,432
- I was trying to humanize us. 
- Yeah, with our funny looking chai tea table.

476
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:43,233
- Very humanizing. 
- Zoltan Kemeny.

477
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,035
- What? 
- That artist’s name...

478
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:47,407
it sounds like robot language, doesn’t it? Zoltan Kemeny. 

479
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:48,207
Don’t say it again.

480
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,560
- Zoltan Kemeny, Zoltan Kemeny. 
- Stop, don’t!

481
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:51,538
Zoltaaaan –

482
00:25:51,948 --> 00:25:55,353
- Oh, I’m sorry. I’m interrupting the fun. 
- No, that’s all right, you’re not.

483
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:57,001
We were just laughing at all the funny haircuts, that’s all. 

484
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:58,541
I know, aren’t they a blast?

485
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:02,393
- It’s just a sea of goofy sideburns. 
- Lunch will be ready in just a few minutes.

486
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,112
- Zoltan. 
- Stop!

487
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:09,889
- Aw, wow, what a beautiful table. 
- Yes, you didn’t have to do that.

488
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:13,392
Oh, Rory, honestly, it’s our pleasure. Perfect timing, kids.

489
00:26:13,494 --> 00:26:15,855
- Excellent. 
- Nice looking lunch, Mom.

490
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,935
- Color coordinated. 
- Guests of honor, why don’t you sit over there.

491
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,817
Thank you.

492
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,601
Aw, family pictures. You have another girl, don’t you?

493
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,798
- Yes, we do. 
- Well, where is she? What does she do?

494
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,067
Oh, um...

495
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:31,195
- She’s not here. 
- I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.

496
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,941
Oh, no no, it’s all right. That’s Carol. She’s a year ahead of Rory. She’s...

497
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:38,844
- She’s following her own path. 
- Right.

498
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:41,230
- Carol’s doing her own thing. 
- Okay.

499
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:45,521
Well, let’s eat everybody. Honored guests, please choose from the chicken first.

500
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:46,616
Thank you very much.

501
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,099
You two are gonna have to fight over the breast as you always do.

502
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:54,000
- So, Lorelai, what’s your alma matter? 
- Well, I was too preoccupied to go to college,

503
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:58,941
what with weighing a couple hundred pounds and having feet twice my normal size and all.

504
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,317
- I see. 
- But she took night classes

505
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,773
and graduated last year. She has an AA degree in business.

506
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:08,082
- Well, that’s wonderful. 
- In fact, it’s refreshing.

507
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,742
It might even be to Rory’s benefit. 

508
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:13,642
Good things didn’t come to your family in one fell swoop, you struggled for it.

509
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:17,031
- That’s true. 
- One fell swoop, interesting phrase.

510
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:18,214
- Very. 
- Origin?

511
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:21,025
It was coined in MacBeth and derives from Middle English.

512
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,473
Very good, son. You know your Shakespeare then, do you?

513
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:26,683
- More than most. 
- In which play does Falstaff appear?

514
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:28,281
That would be plays.

515
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,989
Henry the Fourth, part one and two, and The Merry Wives of Windsor.

516
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:32,961
So that was a different Falstaff than Henry the Fifth?

517
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:36,262
- Aw, shoot! 
- This is a little tradition with us, quizzes at meals.

518
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:39,381
- It keeps the Springsteens sharp. 
- Very Kennedy-esque.

519
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:42,715
- Mm, we love the Kennedys! 
- As do we all.

520
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,606
Now, the person questioned can challenge me with a follow-up if he gets his question right.

521
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:51,251
- Gets pretty competitive. 
- Well, if pistols are drawn, we’re ducking.

522
00:27:51,343 --> 00:27:53,560
- Jack, which Polish composer... 
- Chopin!

523
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:56,545
- Patience... became Prime Minister of his country? 
- Paderewski.

524
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:00,717
That’s right, but your impetuousness cost you a follow-up.

525
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:04,942
Jennifer, can you give me the three sub-classes of the Mesozoic Era?

526
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:08,250
- Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. 
- Good.

527
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:11,552
- Follow-up, what preceded the Mesozoic Era? 
- Paleozoic.

528
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,713
- He’s good. 
- It’s hard to stump Darren.

529
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:16,033
Impossible, he’s brilliant.

530
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,903
Open question – which mythological figure has the head of a man, 

531
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,803
the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion?

532
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:29,018
Here’s a hint – it’s also the title of a novel by Robertson Davies.

533
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,849
- Oh, Manticore. 
- Very good, Rory.

534
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:35,218
- Yes, very good, Rory. 
- Yes, very good, Rory.

535
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,661
- More water, Lorelai? 
- Please, thank you.

536
00:28:37,764 --> 00:28:43,175
Do you know which French city famous for its water was the capital of collaborationist France?

537
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:50,267
Oh, me? Evian, Perrier... Le Crystal Geyser?

538
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:53,841
- Jennifer, you wanna help Lorelai out? 
- Vichy.

539
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:57,353
- That’s correct. 
- Oh, that’s right. Vichy water, I knew that.

540
00:28:57,462 --> 00:29:00,779
What about the year of Germany’s victory in the Franco-Prussian War?

541
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,606
- Huh, me again? 
- If you wish.

542
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:07,830
I don’t know that one. I do know Instanbul is Constantinople,

543
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:13,600
so if you’ve got a date in Constantinople, she’ll be waiting in Instanbul.

544
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,359
- That’s true. 
- You know, um, sorry to interrupt,

545
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:20,739
- but I’d like to wash my hands. 
- Our fault, we rushed you in here.

546
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:24,143
Our downstairs is being remodeled, you have to use upstairs. End of the hall.

547
00:29:24,286 --> 00:29:25,480
- Thank you. 
- Hurry back.

548
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:26,319
I will.

549
00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:33,544
So, that painting there, wow. The colors are so great, I can’t stop staring at it. It’s just beautiful.

550
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:38,142
It is. It’s by a student of Matisse. I think he caught the master’s colors wonderfully.

551
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:42,295
- Oh, Matisse, love him. 
- I think only a charlatan wouldn’t.

552
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:48,141
Anyone know the artistic movement Matisse championed and referred to as the Wild Beast?

553
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:50,052
- Oh, fauvism! 
- Correct.

554
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,423
- Follow up? 
- And then we’ll go round robin.

555
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:05,505
- Coming through! 
- Oh, sorry. I just heard music and...

556
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,210
- Cool room. 
- Tom Waits.

557
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:09,750
- What? 
- The music.

558
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:12,759
- Oh, I thought so. I love him. 
- I worship him.

559
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:14,691
- I even mildly stalked him once. 
- Really?

560
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,008
Last year, I heard he was staying at this hotel so I went there everyday

561
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:20,343
and sat in the lobby drinking massive amounts of coffee waiting for him to walk by.

562
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:22,049
- Did you see him? 
- Nope, never came down.

563
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,465
- For all I know, he’s still there. Hand me that brush? 
- Oh, here.

564
00:30:24,578 --> 00:30:28,363
Stupid manager made me cover for Fiona today. That girl’s a major pie crust.

565
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,899
- Ears? 
- What?

566
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:34,020
- On the chair. What time is it? 
- Three.

567
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:35,806
Oh, totally late for my next job. 

568
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:39,376
Oh well, guess Grandma had to take another trip to the emergency room, right?

569
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:40,942
- Are they on straight? 
- I think so.

570
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:43,855
- Good. Who are you? 
- I’m sorry, I’m Rory Gilmore.

571
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:47,578
- You’re one of the Harvard bound? 
- Yeah. At least, I hope so.

572
00:30:47,676 --> 00:30:51,532
Oh, trust me, you are. You’ve got that really good, straight, shiny Harvard hair.

573
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:52,806
Zip me up?

574
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,658
- I’m sorry, are you Carol? 
- Yeah, why?

575
00:30:56,949 --> 00:30:59,371
- I don’t know, I just didn’t expect... 
- What?

576
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,849
- Well, you. 
- Why?

577
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:03,719
I don’t know. Your parents just made it sound like...

578
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,863
Like I was holed up in the Chelsea with a needle sticking out of my arm 

579
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:07,763
screaming Sid at the top of my lungs?

580
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:10,574
- Kind of. 
- Well, to them, this is pretty close.

581
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:14,977
Can I ask you what exactly you are dressing up like this for?

582
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:17,153
- Morgan Tanner’s fourth birthday party. 
- You’re kidding.

583
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:22,017
Nope, this is my fifth birthday party this week. Great tips, all cash, and of course, there’s cake.

584
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:26,319
So you’re a waitress and a birthday bunny and you go to school. That’s pretty amazing.

585
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:29,294
- I don’t go to school. 
- Oh, sorry, I just assumed.

586
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:32,023
- I mean, your family... 
- My brother and sister got stuck on that conveyor belt.

587
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:35,018
I, however, escaped somewhere around the eleventh grade, thank God.

588
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:40,969
Oh, but no offense. I mean, that’s just me. If you like being on the conveyor belt, then good for you.

589
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:43,563
- I’m not on the conveyor belt. 
- Okay.

590
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,008
I’m not. I want this. I’ve dreamt of going to Harvard since I was a little girl.

591
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:52,565
Yeah, a lot of four year olds dream of that. It comes right after meeting Harry Potter.

592
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,139
Hey, I am not gonna justify myself to someone with a tail.

593
00:31:56,365 --> 00:32:01,060
You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s just that around here the Harvard brainwashing starts in the womb.

594
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:04,947
If you were to tell either of my siblings that there was another life choice outside of the Ivy League,

595
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,968
- I think their khakis would wrinkle. 
- Well, maybe they really want it.

596
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,394
Nope, my parents want it and they wanna please my parents.

597
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:13,411
- Have you seen a carrot? 
- Don’t you wanna please your parents?

598
00:32:13,518 --> 00:32:16,996
- Yeah, but not at the expense of finding myself. 
- Or your carrot.

599
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:19,714
You gotta have your carrot.

600
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:23,713
So, tell me something, Harvard hair – how bad do you wanna please your parents?

601
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:26,785
My mom, and really bad, but it’s not hard to please my mom.

602
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:29,796
She’s okay with anything I do. As long as I’m happy, she’s good.

603
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,117
- You’re sure? 
- I’m very sure.

604
00:32:31,392 --> 00:32:33,861
- Then you’re lucky. 
- Yeah, I am lucky.

605
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:37,666
Oh, Rory, quick, uh, what are the three major Hindu deities,

606
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:40,507
because I’ve missed four questions in a row and if I miss another one, I don’t think I get dessert.

607
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,786
- Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu. 
- Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu.

608
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:43,932
- Hi other daughter. 
- Hi.

609
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,202
And I probably shouldn’t do a gesundheit joke when I say Vishnu?

610
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:47,794
- Good thinking. 
- Okay, thanks, bye.

611
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:50,180
Wait, I’ll go with you. I’m glad to have met you.

612
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:52,140
- Oh, same here. Good luck with Harvard. 
- Thanks.

613
00:32:57,435 --> 00:33:00,170
- What’s that for? 
- For not putting me on the conveyor belt.

614
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:03,133
- Yes, that was very big of me. 
- You don’t know.

615
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:10,164
Thank you so much for this, for answering all my dumb questions.

616
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:12,831
You asked no dumb questions, and I hope my answers sufficed.

617
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:15,561
- Definitely. Bye. 
- Au revoir.

618
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:18,106
Yeah, thank you so much for everything. I know it did a world of good for her.

619
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:20,809
- She’s a very impressive young lady. 
- I wholeheartedly concur.

620
00:33:20,928 --> 00:33:22,873
- You molded her well. 
- Oh, no, I didn’t mold her.

621
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,553
- Rory popped out that way. 
- You’re being modest.

622
00:33:24,665 --> 00:33:26,897
- You don’t know me, do you? 
- So long.

623
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:27,635
Bye.

624
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,795
- What did he say? 
-  That you’re Godlike.

625
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:33,350
- Is that all? 
- Oh, and that his brother Bruce Springsteen

626
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:35,536
would be happy to come and play at our next party or event.

627
00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:38,403
- That would be swell of Bruce. 
- I figured your graduation party.

628
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:39,729
I’ll be very popular.

629
00:33:40,983 --> 00:33:43,180
- All in favor, say aye. 
- Aye.

630
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:47,373
All right, let the record show that the funds have been approved to close the town bank account

631
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:54,308
that holds the town funds in order to open a new town funds bank account at a different banking institution.

632
00:33:54,434 --> 00:34:00,221
Young ladies, in anticipation of your tardiness, we saved two seats for you right there in the back.

633
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:01,409
Thanks for thinking of us, Taylor.

634
00:34:03,184 --> 00:34:06,708
Okay, raise your hand if you bathed in cologne.

635
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:10,906
In the interest of getting home sometime tonight, I’d like to bring up the final point of business,

636
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:17,461
and that is a certain citizen’s desire to open an old fashioned soda shop in town.

637
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:19,351
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- Who’s the guy?

638
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:22,008
What other putz would wanna open up an old-fashioned soda shop?

639
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:25,243
- Dispense with the Yiddish, young man. 
- This is not a town matter, Taylor.

640
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:28,489
This is a private matter between you and me which was settled when I said no.

641
00:34:28,582 --> 00:34:33,672
This is a town matter because when this town is in need of a particular business

642
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:38,244
to provide necessary services, it’s up to the town to band together and lure it.

643
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,625
How does a stupid soda shop count as a necessary business?

644
00:34:40,723 --> 00:34:45,971
Allow me to show you something that will make you wonder how we ever lived without it.

645
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:47,286
Kirk, if you will.

646
00:34:49,094 --> 00:34:52,346
Kirk, I told you to get something decorative to cover it.

647
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:56,237
Well, my mom wouldn’t let me use one of her nice tablecloths so I just grabbed a sheet from my hamper.

648
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,293
Take it off.

649
00:34:59,955 --> 00:35:03,042
- What’s that, a toy? 
- Oh, it’s awfully cute.

650
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:07,784
That is a professionally manufactured diorama of the proposed business.

651
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:10,851
- Wow, there’s little people and everything. 
- They look so real.

652
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:15,633
- Hey, it’s me holding a tiny zucchini! 
- Look at the horse drawn carriage.

653
00:35:15,704 --> 00:35:19,806
My thought was to park it out front with the name of the business painted on the side.

654
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:23,575
- It’s very eighteen-hundreds. 
- The horse is taller than the front door.

655
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:25,593
- Way taller. 
- What are you up to, Taylor?

656
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:29,334
- Are you breeding giant horses? 
- It’s slightly out of proportion.

657
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:33,431
Slightly? That little guy there could walk right under the horse without even ducking.

658
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:36,447
You’re missing the big picture here, townsfolk.

659
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:41,777
Now, this wonderful business belongs in Stars Hollow – whether Luke rents the space willingly or not.

660
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:45,920
- How would I not rent it willingly? 
- I’m talking about eminent domain, my friend.

661
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:50,404
Check the town’s bylaws. If a three-fourths majority finds it necessary

662
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:54,383
to use the space for a specific function, the landowner must concede.

663
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:58,480
That’s for taking over houses to turn into hospitals during a national emergency like the Civil War.

664
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:01,352
If you wanna turn this place into a Civil War hospital, be my guest!

665
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:06,765
Some would attest that the succor that my soda shop is going to offer is on the same level

666
00:36:06,857 --> 00:36:09,958
- as the comfort that a hospital could provide. 
- You’re gonna need a hospital, Taylor!

667
00:36:10,053 --> 00:36:11,178
- Hit him! 
- Which one?

668
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,108
- Either one, I’m easy. 
- Come on, Luke.

669
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:18,061
This shop is based on the original soda shop that was in town eighty years ago.

670
00:36:18,102 --> 00:36:22,018
- Don’t you see? You are preventing the town... 
- From moving backwards.

671
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,898
Who here wants to do that?

672
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,901
- We like ice cream. 
- Oh, come on.

673
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:30,641
A nice burger from Luke’s and an ice cream soda, yum!

674
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:32,224
- You want that thing? 
- With a cherry.

675
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:34,281
With the striped awning and the giant horse?

676
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,006
- Be ready to pay through the nose. 
- We’ll talk terms.

677
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:42,991
We have our soda shop everybody!

678
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:46,631
Meeting dismissed.

679
00:36:46,903 --> 00:36:49,137
Taylor, is it too soon to talk about management opportunities?

680
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,127
Hey, you get to be Taylor’s landlord, that’s kind of cool.

681
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:53,708
Thanks for your lack of help.

682
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:55,711
Grump.

683
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:03,953
- So, how was lunch with Harvard guy? 
- Great, he answered all my questions.

684
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,863
He makes a killer chicken, he sticks a lemon up its butt.

685
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:06,627
Nice.

686
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:09,643
And he gave me excellent tips on how to write my essay. We’re very impressed with him.

687
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,789
He passes the test.

688
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:13,088
- Excuse me, Lane? 
- That’s me.

689
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,899
- Okay, great, I’m Dave Rygalski. 
- Right, hi. You’re a guitarist.

690
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,819
- Yeah. 
- But how’d you know I was me?

691
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,277
- The Dead Kennedys shirt was a tip off. 
- Good thinking.

692
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,180
Hey, isn’t it a drag that Jello Biafra isn’t singing for them anymore?

693
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,899
Yeah, now their front-man’s that kid from the Courtship of Eddie’s Father.

694
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,100
Yeah, what’s next – Urkel joining the Wu-Tang Clan?

695
00:37:29,186 --> 00:37:31,138
Or maybe Malcolm in the Middle fronting for the Butthole Surfers.

696
00:37:31,235 --> 00:37:32,832
- Some things are sacred. 
- I’m with ya on that.

697
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:35,629
- So, what’s your band like? 
- We do a lot of cool covers...

698
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:41,383
the Clash, the Kinks, et cetera. Statistically, it’s like thirty-eight of the forty-three bands you listed.

699
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:42,444
Nice percentage.

700
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:45,086
I can play you a song we demo’d a couple weeks ago using a drum machine.

701
00:37:45,178 --> 00:37:47,158
Great. What’s all this?

702
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:50,533
Well, this is a headphone amp and it just boosts the volume and makes the clarity off the hook,

703
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:55,592
and then these are Grado 125s, which is just really, killer, killer portable sound.

704
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:59,469
- I’m sort of an audio geek, sorry. 
- No, don’t apologize, I love you...

705
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:03,539
for that, for being that way. I love it. Um, I’m like that too.

706
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:05,341
You wanna go over to the bench maybe and have a listen?

707
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:06,632
- Yeah. 
- Okay.

708
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:12,014
- I think a love song’s in their future. 
- With lots of lyrics about snogging.

709
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:13,246
- About what? 
- Hey.

710
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:16,263
Hey. You missed everything.

711
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,973
- That’s snogging. 
- Got it.

712
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:20,902
- Bye. 
- So, any fireworks?

713
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:23,601
Well, there was a classic Luke/Taylor dispute,

714
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:27,071
but it was resolved and will result in ice cream floats and twenty foot horses.

715
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:30,231
- Good deal. And what about your lunch? 
- Oh, it was great.

716
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,313
I feel so much better about things now. The application’s not freaking me out anymore.

717
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:37,241
- You look unfreaked. 
- Well, nothing can stop me now.

718
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,993
- It’s full steam ahead. 
- That’s great.

719
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,273
- Can I ask you something? 
- Of course you can.

720
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,077
- What happens when you leave? 
- When I leave when?

721
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:46,847
When you leave for Harvard... do we break up?

722
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,786
Whoa, that was blunt and out of nowhere.

723
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:51,600
Well, it seems like we should be blunt right now.

724
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,986
No, we don’t break up. Do you want that?

725
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:55,925
No, but how will we see each other?

726
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:58,384
Easy, weekends – that’s what they were invented for.

727
00:38:58,517 --> 00:39:00,821
So you’ll come home, do homework all weekend, then leave.

728
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:05,260
No, I can do my homework during the week or on the train coming home to see you,

729
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:07,337
who I will spend my weekends with not doing homework. 

730
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:11,137
Plus, we can talk during the week on the phone constantly.

731
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:13,940
- Trust me, it’ll feel like I never left. 
- Oh yeah?

732
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:17,973
Christiane Amanpour spends half of her life standing in foxholes in third world countries,

733
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:22,219
and she has a husband and a kid. And she was on C-SPAN last week getting some award,

734
00:39:22,295 --> 00:39:25,148
so if she and her husband can make it work, we can.

735
00:39:25,254 --> 00:39:27,687
- So we’ll have access to the CNN jet? 
- No.

736
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:31,834
- Or hey, you can go to college in Boston. 
- I’m going to junior college.

737
00:39:31,926 --> 00:39:34,595
- Boston has junior colleges. 
- But not dorm rooms.

738
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:37,836
- Well, you can rent an apartment. 
- With the money I get when I win the lottery?

739
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:42,116
- I mean, I think access to the CNN jet is more likely. 
- Why are you being like this? So...

740
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,045
- Realistic? 
- Come on, be serious.

741
00:39:45,168 --> 00:39:47,970
I am. I am.

742
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,338
That’s too serious.

743
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:55,075
Yeah, you know, just forget it.

744
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:59,575
- Come on, we were gonna go to Luke’s, right? 
- Yeah.

745
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,482
Let’s go to Luke’s.

746
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:05,104
- It’s great, it really is. 
- Okay, cool.

747
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:08,368
Well, listen, then I’ll talk to the guys, and we’ll get together and play next week.

748
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:11,057
Sure. I’ve gotta get home.

749
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:13,407
- All right. Well, it was good meeting you, Lane. 
- Same here.

750
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:19,382
- Trust God, is that a band? 
- No. My life.

751
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:22,721
Oh, come on, you do not like modern art.

752
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,881
Oh, then I was mistaken, I guess I don’t.

753
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,458
- I’m a mindless android, I have no opinions. 
- Well, what kind do you like?

754
00:40:29,556 --> 00:40:31,826
Yeah, do you like the kind that looks like someone hemorrhaged on a canvas?

755
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:33,498
Yes, I love hemorrhaging.

756
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:36,244
Or the sculpture that looks like it was dropped and then glued back together?

757
00:40:36,356 --> 00:40:41,291
Actually, the real love of my life is being mercilessly teased by the two of you for simply stating an opinion.

758
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,643
- Oh, we’re sorry. 
- Yeah, we’re sorry. Kisses!

759
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:45,732
- Oh, in public, no less. 
- Hey, where’s Rory?

760
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:48,507
- We need all the girls a-kissing ya. 
- Hey, that reminds me,

761
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:51,071
- what are you gonna do with Rory’s room? 
- Her room, when?

762
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,946
When she’s gone. Are you doing anything with it?

763
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:55,358
- Well, I haven’t thought about it. 
- Well, let me know.

764
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,129
- We can work something out. 
- You want her room?

765
00:40:57,216 --> 00:40:59,352
For what, your burgeoning modern art collection?

766
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:02,935
- I’m talking about my tools. 
- Oh, your tools, yeah.

767
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:05,546
- What tools? 
- I have this collection of antique farming tools

768
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:08,028
- that my dad passed down to me. 
- Pre-Revolutionary War.

769
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:10,958
- They’re kind of valuable. 
- And I’ve got no place to put ‘em.

770
00:41:11,046 --> 00:41:13,739
- I’ve been looking for the right space. 
- In Rory’s room?

771
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:15,844
- It’s perfect! 
- But she’s got all her stuff in it.

772
00:41:15,936 --> 00:41:16,954
Not for long.

773
00:41:17,278 --> 00:41:20,479
- Yeah, right, not for long. 
- Just think about it.

774
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,064
Yeah, I will. I will.

775
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:35,583
- No, no, not another band phone call! 
- We never gave Lane a cutoff time.

776
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:40,074
Let the machine get it. I cannot talk to another seventeen-year-old whose every other word is ‘uh’.

777
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,651
- Not even a word. 
- Exactly.

778
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:43,979
Hello, Gilmores! This is Darren Springsteen, how are ya?

779
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:47,168
I just wanted to let you know that I just finished going over Rory’s records here, 

780
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:48,908
and no shock, they’re perfect.

781
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:52,458
Rory, you are tailor-made for Harvard. They’re lucky to have you.

782
00:41:52,531 --> 00:41:55,131
As far as I’m concerned, you should pack your bags.

783
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:59,044
I’m gonna tell all this to the people in admissions and I’ll give your headmaster a call as well,

784
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:01,850
so take care and we’ll talk again. Bye-bye.

785
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:04,594
- That’s fantastic, honey. 
- Yeah.

786
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:06,893
- You’re in. 
- Well, not officially.

787
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:09,714
- He said pack your bags. 
- Yeah, cool.

788
00:42:11,215 --> 00:42:14,559
So what are you up to today? You have newspaper stuff to do, right?

789
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,908
Yeah, a ton, and you were going to catch up with some stuff at the inn?

790
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:20,468
Payroll... a lot of check signing to do.

791
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,747
- Are people waiting for their checks? 
- Kind of.

792
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:27,999
Right. You know, the newspaper stuff can wait ‘til Monday.

793
00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:30,371
- Really? ‘Cause I can sign the checks tomorrow. 
- You sure?

794
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:32,000
- Absolutely. 
- So what do you wanna do?

795
00:42:32,076 --> 00:42:33,416
I don’t know, what do you wanna do?

796
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,479
- I don’t know, let’s just hang. 
- That sounds great.

797
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:41,118
You had to have ordered that sign weeks ago! You were that sure that I would cave in?

798
00:42:41,189 --> 00:42:43,781
Well, you did, didn’t you? The right’s too high.

799
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:46,945
And when did it become Taylor’s? It said Stars Hollow on the stupid model,

800
00:42:47,017 --> 00:42:50,196
and I don’t like the extra P and E at the end of shop. Get rid of it!

801
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:52,357
- No. 
- I’m your landlord, Taylor.

802
00:42:52,456 --> 00:42:55,706
And as a tenant, I have rights. Talk to my lawyer if you disagree.

803
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:59,653
And how are you spelling rights, Taylor? With two E’s and three S’s?

804
