1
00:00:02,588 --> 00:00:03,813
Morning, everyone.

2
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:06,124
What's wrong?

3
00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:07,975
Uh-oh, food funk?

4
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:08,991
Major.

5
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:11,977
Are we talking the "Swiss chard a la
polonaise" level funk from last may,

6
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:13,858
the panna cotta experiment of '05?

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,980
2001 pigeons a la nicoise.

8
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,123
Pigeons a la nicoise? Oh, boy.

9
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,309
Sookie?

10
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,364
You mean "sucky"?

11
00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:24,223
What's up?

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,832
I'll tel you what's up.
You know what this is?

13
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:26,422
An oyster?

14
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:27,876
An oyster-- fresh, huh?

15
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:28,780
Looks fresh to me.

16
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:30,274
I mean, the idea-- nice and fresh.

17
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:31,296
- Sure.
- It isn't.

18
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:32,204
- What isn't?
- Fresh.

19
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,478
- The oyster?
- You're not listening.

20
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:33,965
I am, too.

21
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:35,273
- What am I saying?
- No idea.

22
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:36,572
How long have we been married?

23
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:37,398
Nine years?

24
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:41,794
I'm experimenting for the prefix menu
for Valentine's day next week,

25
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:44,800
trying to come up with something new,
but there's nothing new under the sun.

26
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:48,563
I mean, who else would think to serve
oysters on Valentine's day?

27
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:52,437
I don't know, maybe 12,000 other
establishments within spitting distance!

28
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:54,296
Well, lovers love oysters.

29
00:00:54,384 --> 00:00:55,763
I don't. I love burritos.

30
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:57,777
But people don't want burritos
on Valentine's day.

31
00:00:57,882 --> 00:01:00,399
How do we know unless we give
them the option, huh?

32
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:02,339
That's it! I'll serve burritos!

33
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:02,910
Sookie, no.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
No one else will have burritos.

35
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,747
Sookie, you can't serve Valentine's day
burritos. That's flirting with disaster.

36
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,527
We could be talking the octopus-ice-cream
disaster of '98.

37
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:12,581
God, you're right. I'll figure it out.

38
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:14,808
I'm just hitting an oyster wall here.

39
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,843
Okay, take a break, guys.
We'll resume in a bit.

40
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,237
So what are you and Jackson doing for
Valentine's day, huh? Any plans?

41
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:25,562
Well, after I finish up here, I'll go home,
and Jackson, wonderful man that he is,

42
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:30,031
will have made a lovely meal and opened
up a bottle of syrah and lit a candle.

43
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,847
Then he and the kids and I will have a nice,
romantic meal together.

44
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:34,641
Very nice.

45
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,445
What about you?

46
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:36,474
Oh, I'll be here.

47
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,078
What? No, you'll be with Luke.

48
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,851
Yeah, but we'll probably just hang out.

49
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,689
We don't have a reservation
anyplace for dinner.

50
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:42,753
I'm sure everything's booked.

51
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,946
Uh, hello. I'm a chef. I know other chefs.

52
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:46,031
I can get you into places.

53
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:49,751
Maybe-- also Luke says Valentine's day is
just another one of those fake things,

54
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,978
like mother's day,
created by greeting-card companies,
and it is.

55
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:54,247
Actually, it's not.

56
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:54,864
Really?

57
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,919
I'm printing a history of Valentine's
day to go on the tables.

58
00:01:58,012 --> 00:02:00,555
It goes back like 2,000 years.

59
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:03,809
Oh, well, then, it must have been a
greeting-card company in roman times--

60
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,957
you know,
the one that came up with gladiator's day.

61
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:07,134
Anyway, no plans yet.

62
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:10,630
Lorelai, excuse me,
there's a zydeco band here to see you.

63
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:11,255
A what?

64
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:12,584
A zydeco band?

65
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,867
Did I mishear him twice?

66
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:15,020
Then I did, too.

67
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:16,112
Come on.

68
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:23,751
Hi, I'm Lorelai Gilmore.
How can I help you guys?

69
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:24,704
I'm Buzu.

70
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,035
Buzu-- that's your name? Buzu?

71
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:27,802
- Buzu Barnes--
- Buzu Barnes.

72
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,438
And the Cajun Stompers!

73
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:31,371
Sorry, I'm like a thousand miles behind here.

74
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:34,188
We set this up a while ago, the audition.
Buzu.

75
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:35,966
Buzu! You're that Buzu.

76
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:37,390
You know more than one Buzu?

77
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:39,485
I set this up myself. It was for the wedding.

78
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:40,777
- The audition.
- The audition!

79
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,314
- Oh, the wedding.
- What you want to hear?

80
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:45,715
Well, it's like this, Buzu.
I don't need to hear you play because--

81
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:47,355
Oh, miss Gilmore, no, it's like this.

82
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:49,935
When a zydeco band is at the instrument,
they must play.

83
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:51,876
- But--
- "Zydeco Boogaloo," boys.

84
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:53,875
1, 2, 3, 4.

85
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,461
And they're off.

86
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:59,142
Since when are you into zydeco?

87
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:01,182
I just thought it might be festive and funny.

88
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:05,473
I was going to audition them and a
dixieland combo and Led Zepagain.

89
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,007
Who?

90
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,417
A Led Zeppelin cover band.

91
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:09,053
Oh. That's clever.

92
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,629
It just slipped my mind.

93
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,547
June 3rd's coming up pretty quick, too, hon.

94
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,558
I know, it is superquick.

95
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:16,074
You don't like the song?

96
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:17,426
No, Buzu, I love the song.

97
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,487
Lips say yes, face say no.

98
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:21,171
"Early in the morning," boys.

99
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,334
1, 2, 3, 4.

100
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:28,208
Smile, or Buzu may never go away.

101
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:28,972
I'm smiling.

102
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:29,966
Yeah.

103
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:33,516
- Hey.
- Hi.

104
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,249
Why are you up?

105
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,038
It's 11:04. The whole world is up.

106
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:37,902
Keith Richard isn't up.
Pete Doherty isn't up.

107
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:38,905
Rory Gilmore is up.

108
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:40,656
She shouldn't be. You're making me dizzy.

109
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:41,942
I forgot my thucydides.

110
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:44,076
Don't see how you can function
without your thucydides.

111
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:46,245
Hey, I'm trying to squoosh
four semesters into three.

112
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:47,744
If I slow down, I'll get whoomped.

113
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:48,746
How long you been up?

114
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:51,123
Five hours, four cups of coffee, two bagels.

115
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:52,330
No partridge, no pear tree?

116
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,878
Okay, thucydides did not just
grow legs and walk away.

117
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,447
- Come back to bed!
- I can't.

118
00:04:57,553 --> 00:04:59,493
We see each other less since
we've been living together.

119
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:00,335
I know it seems that way.

120
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:01,806
- It is that way.
- We'll have time.

121
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:03,515
Not unless we make time.
Let's go away this weekend.

122
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:04,430
This weekend's bad.

123
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:05,324
Every weekend's bad.

124
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:06,935
This one is particularly bad.

125
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,492
They're all bad. Come on.
It's Valentine's day.

126
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:10,594
That's not till next week.

127
00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:13,035
This weekend's Valentine's weekend. Come on,
let's go somewhere.

128
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,470
- I can't--
- Rory.

129
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:18,251
Even if I did get time away, I promised
my mom I'd try to hang out with her,

130
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:20,411
even if it was just for dinner.
I haven't seen her in ages.

131
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:21,788
But she doesn't kiss as good as I do.

132
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,018
- You don't know that.
- True.

133
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,425
She's been down lately.
I want to cheer her up.

134
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:28,074
Well, then invite her along.
We can have a kissing contest.

135
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,839
Bring my mother?

136
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:31,277
Yeah.
And tell her to bring that guy she's with.
What's his name? Luke?

137
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:32,478
Really? You'd be up for that?

138
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,544
Absolutely.

139
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,516
Well, I'd have to drop a lot of things.

140
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:37,248
That's what things are for-- to be dropped.

141
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,130
I'll think about it.

142
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,101
Promise?

143
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,994
Yes. Now you have to let me go.

144
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,075
That's the worst offer I've gotten all day.

145
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,529
Your thucydides is on the pool table.

146
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:46,490
Thank you!

147
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,678
I need every proof sheet on my desk
by 5:00 and not a second later.

148
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:56,067
Make that very clear to them, okay?

149
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:56,734
Okay.

150
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,688
I know the boys in the lab can be jerks
to women, but don't let that stop you.

151
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,465
Girlpower, baby. Betty Friedan's dead,
and we've all got to fill the vacuum.

152
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:03,619
You got it.

153
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,016
Sorry, Bill.

154
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:07,199
No problem. Got all the time in the world.

155
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,730
Let's see.
How about "amphetamine use on campus"?

156
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:11,608
Maybe--

157
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,429
it would be ironic if my supply dried
up based on an exposé I approved.

158
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:16,166
Are you serious?

159
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:17,960
You leave your sense of humor at home, Bill?

160
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:21,181
There's another protest over the
Yale basic-cable-package fee.

161
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,006
They're expecting 80 or so to gather.

162
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,496
Doesn't worth a story. Get a photo and tell
them all to go home and read a book.

163
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:29,893
And professor Wallace wants a correction
to the interview we printed with him.

164
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:32,688
He wants to clarify that he, in fact,
referred to his department's problems

165
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:36,318
with the advisory board as
an "us-and-them thing".

166
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:37,358
What did we print?

167
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,832
"S-and-M thing."

168
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:39,847
That's kind of funny.

169
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:42,256
Now, the profile on Yale students
from New Orleans,

170
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:43,718
how things are back home for them--

171
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:44,934
it'll be done this weekend.

172
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,841
I could get a copy to you Sunday morning.

173
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:47,645
Great.

174
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:49,775
Uh, I mean, no. Wait till Monday.

175
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:50,888
- You sure?
- Yeah.

176
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:52,694
It's Valentine's day weekend.

177
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,841
We should all... take it easy,
be with loved ones.

178
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:57,320
You can make plans with that
girlfriend of yours.

179
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,399
She just dumped me.

180
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,469
Linda dumped you?

181
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:00,456
For another guy.

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,681
It destroyed me.

183
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:03,266
Absolutely destroyed me.

184
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:04,772
That's why I've lost my sense of humor.

185
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:06,576
Nothing's funny anymore.

186
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,146
I had forgotten Valentine's
day was coming up. Wow.

187
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,607
Oh, god, I hate my life.

188
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:11,760
Right.

189
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,151
See? This is why I hesitate to ask
people about their social lives.

190
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:15,988
I never do.

191
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,068
Good man.

192
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:19,167
I'll get on that New Orleans thing.

193
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:27,389
Dragonfly Inn.

194
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,624
Hi, it's me.

195
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:29,479
I'm sorry?

196
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,303
It's me!

197
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:31,302
Oh, hi, hon!

198
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,299
What's with the flaming accordion
in the background there?

199
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:37,037
Oh, it's my new friend, Buzu,
which is cajun for "won't leave."

200
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:37,927
Explain.

201
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:40,311
It's a zydeco band I'd arranged
to audition for the wedding,

202
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:42,363
and once they're holding their instruments,
they can't not play--

203
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,597
and, apparently, they can't stop.

204
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,580
- Oh, they stopped.
- Good.

205
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:48,279
I mean,
they haven't had food or water in two hours.

206
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:50,001
It makes sense that they'd have to--

207
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,298
torture me.

208
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,629
Maybe you can get zydeco cops
to come and stop them.

209
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,905
So I guess this is the last nail
in the coffin of June 3rd.

210
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,983
The cut-off day to get the deposit
back on the hall just passed, too.

211
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:02,188
Might be time to face the music, so to speak.

212
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:05,034
You know anyone in the market for a wedding?
It's all planned and paid for.

213
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,683
You'll have your wedding, eventually.

214
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:07,522
I guess.

215
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,914
Mom, you'll have your wedding.

216
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,156
I don't know anymore.

217
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:11,962
Luke's been so busy with April lately.

218
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:14,713
I mean, it's good and all.
It's the right thing to do.

219
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,745
She's his daughter. But I just...

220
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:17,892
I'm bummed, kid.

221
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:18,813
I know.

222
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:21,971
Well, hey, what have you got planned
for Valentine's day weekend?

223
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:23,383
Uh, this weekend?

224
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:24,829
Nothing-- surprise, surprise.

225
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:26,787
Luke isn't really a Valentine's
day kind of guy.

226
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,490
Well, how would you like an all-expense-paid
trip to Martha's vineyard?

227
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:31,824
Martha's vineyard? Really?

228
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,099
You know,
Logan's family has a place up there.
It's awesome.

229
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:36,058
And I just cleared my schedule
here at the paper,

230
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:37,679
told them, "mama needs some time off."

231
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:38,605
Good for mama.

232
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:40,146
Go with us, you and Luke.

233
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,536
Really? You've run this past Logan?

234
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,525
It was his idea.

235
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:44,332
I don't know if Luke would be up for it.

236
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,918
We'll make him be up for it.
I think he'd like it. It's beach,
it's nature.

237
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,898
I mean, it'll be cold,
but we can still walk outside.
It's beautiful.

238
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,738
I've always wanted to see the vineyard.

239
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:56,425
Then force him to come,
and if he's a sourpuss while he's there,
you'll still have me.

240
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,571
Okay, I'll talk to him.

241
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:59,633
I'll e-mail you directions.
Come anytime Friday.

242
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,134
You've got room and all?
Me and Luke plus five?

243
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:02,883
Plus five?

244
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,390
Well, I'm not coming without
Buzu and the boys.

245
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:06,311
The more the merrier.

246
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,335
Cool! Bye, hon.

247
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:08,274
Bye.

248
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:12,909
Buzu, I'm going to need my dining room back.

249
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:13,786
Buzu!

250
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,097
Well, there is all manner of outdoor
activities to do at Martha's vineyard--

251
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:19,162
canoeing, snorkeling, sailing--

252
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,514
That's mostly summer stuff.
It's the dead of winter.

253
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:22,969
Hiking and walking-- that's doable.

254
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,115
Yeah, I guess.
Is this all just for this weekend?

255
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:25,771
Plus these.

256
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:27,414
Isn't that way too much stuff?

257
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:29,930
It is the dead of winter. The question is,
do you have enough?

258
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,178
Yeah, I brought enough.

259
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:32,493
Burglar lamp.

260
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:36,690
Ooh, and here, of course, is the big-time
Martha's vineyard thing-- whaling.

261
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:37,579
They have whaling?

262
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:39,476
Not anymore. It's just a fun fact.

263
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,420
Martha's vineyard was one of the
world's largest whaling ports.

264
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,504
Says here people used every part
of the whale back then,

265
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:48,914
the most important being spermaceti,
used in candle production.

266
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,761
Couldn't think up a less gross
substance to use for candles?

267
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:54,348
You know,
it's a good thing I don't drive a compact.

268
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,464
Herman Melville once shipped
out of Martha's vineyard.

269
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:57,602
Here's a quote from "Moby Dick."

270
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,389
"Oars, oars, grip your oars,

271
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,581
and clutch your souls now.
My god, pull, men!"

272
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,615
Wait a second. That isn't the pulling they
had to do to get the spermaceti, is it?

273
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,715
I don't think so. Let's go.
We're already late.

274
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:08,770
Coming.

275
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,305
Now, what else, what else, what else.

276
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:14,226
"The first people on the island
of Martha's vineyard

277
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,661
were Indians of the Wampanoag tribe.

278
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:21,960
This tribe still makes up a large part of
the town originally called Gay Head."

279
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,774
Hmm, figures-- the Indians
survive poverty, disease,

280
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:26,775
then get stuck living in a
place called "Gay Head."

281
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:27,731
I guess.

282
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:30,341
You think there's any connection
between Gay Head and spermaceti?

283
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:31,795
I have no idea.

284
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:33,291
- Wait, it's an island?
- Yeah, apparently.

285
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:34,522
That means there's a ferry.

286
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:38,289
Oh, there is a ferry to Gay Head?
That is just too easy.

287
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:40,492
Let's see what else is interesting
about the island

288
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,240
we now know as Martha's vineyard.

289
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,887
You don't have to do this.

290
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:44,472
Do what?

291
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:47,431
I'm fine with the weekend.
You don't have to keep talking the place up.

292
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,673
I just want you to have fun. You know,
I want you to relax.

293
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:52,344
I'll try, okay? I just have my concerns.

294
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,316
What concerns?

295
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:56,639
What concerns?
Lorelai, where do we even stand with this guy?

296
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:57,329
What guy?

297
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:59,580
Logan. Their relationship changes daily.

298
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,814
One day we like him, next day we hate him,
next day we like him.

299
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,244
Well, we have a sort of truce.

300
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,146
A truce? What does that mean, a truce?

301
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:07,773
It's a truce. Everything's okay.

302
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:11,808
None of us should invade each other or fire
guns across our borders or anything.

303
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:12,677
We're in a truce.

304
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,238
What if they break up while we're there?

305
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:15,116
They're not going to break up.

306
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,580
Our bedroom isn't sharing a wall with theirs,
is it?

307
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:18,760
I have no idea.

308
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:19,880
You don't know the layout of the house?

309
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,534
I thought spermaceti was a pasta
until three minutes ago.

310
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,390
It's weird staying at people's houses,
tiptoeing around,

311
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,893
using their sheets,
drinking their weird tap water.

312
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,464
We'll stick to small beer.
That's what they drank on the whaling boats.

313
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:32,884
If it's good enough for
the spermaceti boys...

314
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:35,463
Come on,
I don't want this to be work for you.

315
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,835
It's not work. Flipping burgers is work.

316
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,134
This weekend's going to be fine.

317
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:40,146
Maybe even fun?

318
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:45,165
Yes, fun. Oh, hey,
I left April's bike in the garage.

319
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:46,180
Oh, why?

320
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,768
I was going to fix the wheel,
and I forgot it was in the back.

321
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,345
Is it okay I parked it there?

322
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:51,389
Oh, yeah.

323
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:52,607
It should be safe.

324
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,457
All right, good. Let's go.

325
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,405
We have a ferry to catch.

326
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:58,610
Please, don't add anything to that.

327
00:11:58,726 --> 00:11:59,838
Party pooper.

328
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:04,196
Ooh, there are a bunch of historical
lighthouses. We should definitely see them.

329
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:05,231
Huh.

330
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:08,885
I wonder if there's a connection between
the shape of lighthouses,

331
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:12,123
ferries, spermaceti, and Gay Head.

332
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:34,795
- You made it!
- We made it!

333
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:36,250
- Hi, Luke!
- Hey, sorry we're late.

334
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,199
You're not late.

335
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:38,882
It took longer than we thought,
the ferry and all.

336
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:40,509
Did you know Martha's vineyard is an island?

337
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:41,758
Well, I've been here before.

338
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:43,262
Hey, there's our intrepid travelers.

339
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,105
Hi, Logan.

340
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,738
Welcome, and this must be Luke.

341
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,616
Oh, no, I dumped Luke. This is Clem.

342
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:49,939
I picked him up at a truck stop on 95.

343
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,145
We were at the register,
paying for our blue plates,

344
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,257
and our hands reached for the
same Dixie Chicks cassette.

345
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,179
- Luke Danes.
- Logan Huntzberger.

346
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,545
Anything else to unload?

347
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,556
Uh, there's a few things, but I've got it.

348
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,108
Great.

349
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:01,492
So this is the place.

350
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:05,960
This is the den, and the dining room,
which seats 20, the wet bar.

351
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,344
Just keeps getting better.

352
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:09,260
And that's the living room,
the kitchen's up there,

353
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,604
and the ocean's out there,
but you can't see it.

354
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:12,732
Ahh, rip-off.

355
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:13,639
You guys hungry?

356
00:13:13,731 --> 00:13:15,230
We're fine. We ate on the road.

357
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:17,970
Cool.
Just a couple peculiarities about the house.

358
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:19,982
It's a grandma, so it's got its kinks.

359
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:22,489
Some of the hardwood floors have buckled,
so watch your step.

360
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:23,967
The french doors are warped from the winter,

361
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:25,506
so you have to give them a
yank when you open them.

362
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,771
And that noise you may hear outside
your window in the morning...

363
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:28,694
That would be Stan.

364
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:29,861
- Gardener?
- Raccoon.

365
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:31,777
He's been living on the property
longer than my family has.

366
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,024
so we give him free rain.

367
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,662
And the showers-- there are three of them.

368
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:36,813
Run any two at the same time,
and they turn to ice,

369
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,852
so give everybody heads-up
before you take a dive.

370
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:39,838
Oh, good to know.

371
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:41,567
And in the morning,
we'll have stuff here to eat,

372
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,890
or you can go up the street to
Joe's Café for breakfast.

373
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:44,719
They open at 8:00.

374
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:45,763
7:00, actually.

375
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,997
Right, 7:00. We never go before 8:00.
But that's all.

376
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,151
Want to see your room?

377
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:53,723
Here we are-- we call it the
King and Queen's suite.

378
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:55,062
Neat. Why?

379
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:57,638
Because you're our honored guests,
and I just named it that a second ago.

380
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:58,597
We'll take it.

381
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:01,519
So, the controller for the heater
is by the nightstand.

382
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:04,397
All of the windows open,
except for the second one on the left,

383
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:06,002
so don't try to open it because
you'll hurt your back.

384
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,475
- And don't forget about the showers.
- Got it.

385
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:08,889
I guess we'll see you guys later.

386
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:11,171
I'd like to tip you, but I've only got a $20.
You got change?

387
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:13,146
- Just add it to the bill, ma'am.
- Will do.

388
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,020
Thanks.

389
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,281
Good to have you here.

390
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,363
So, nice digs, huh?

391
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,661
Kind of dark to see.

392
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:25,355
Well, I saw the weather forecast.
They're predicting light in the morning.

393
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:26,772
So, how does this work?

394
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:27,650
How does what work?

395
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,890
Are we supposed to stay in this room tonight?

396
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:30,902
What's wrong with the room?

397
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:32,617
Nothing, it's just that it's only 9:30.

398
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:33,810
It's that early?

399
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:35,350
What do you think they're
going to do out there?

400
00:14:35,443 --> 00:14:36,804
I don't know.
You think they're going to do something?

401
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,434
I don't know. She's your daughter and
your daughter's snotty boyfriend.

402
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:40,722
Snotty? I thought he was very nice.

403
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:43,063
You call that nice? How he embarrassed Rory?

404
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,047
How did he embarrass her?

405
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:47,385
Correcting her like that with the
"it's open at 7:00" thing?

406
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,335
She was humiliated.

407
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:49,517
She wasn't humiliated.

408
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:51,783
Well, we just need them to
hold on for three days.

409
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,032
Hold on how?

410
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:54,232
Hold on and not break up.

411
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,547
They're not going to break
up in the next three days.

412
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:56,717
They're not gonna break
in the next three days.

413
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:59,031
Okay, are we in the room for the night
or you want to venture out?

414
00:14:59,129 --> 00:14:59,993
I don't know.

415
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:02,284
I'll go see what's what,
get the lay of the land here.

416
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,513
- Okay.
- Okay.

417
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:23,961
Psst!

418
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,319
Hey, you.

419
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,971
Are we supposed to stay in our rooms?

420
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,853
What? No. Why?

421
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:31,027
Just checking.

422
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:33,071
You can stay in there or come out here.

423
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:34,376
Okay, cool.

424
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,603
Then why are you whispering?

425
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,539
I don't know. We're in somebody else's house.

426
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,528
I know, it's a little weird,
being a foursome.

427
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:40,865
A little. We'll adjust.

428
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,639
Yeah, we'll adjust.

429
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:44,971
So, in or out?

430
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:46,815
I think we'll stay in.

431
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,148
- Okay.
- All right.

432
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:49,807
- Good night.
- Night.

433
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:57,012
We've got ourselves a beautiful day.

434
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:59,626
The ocean is so blue.

435
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:00,658
I love the beach in the winter.

436
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,867
The summer's too hot, too congested,
you know?

437
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:04,323
Yep, congested.

438
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:05,392
What are you doing?

439
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:06,230
Nothing.

440
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,031
Are you eating?

441
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:08,074
Just a powerbar.

442
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:08,890
Powerbar?

443
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:09,730
You want one?

444
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:11,584
No. Luke, why are you eating?

445
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:13,028
Well, I wasn't sure what the deal was.

446
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:13,892
The deal was of what?

447
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:15,728
I didn't know whether they
served food or not.

448
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:16,701
What else do you have in here?

449
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:17,601
Just stuff.

450
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:18,294
First-aid kit?

451
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:19,608
In case we got hurt.

452
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:21,702
Baggie full of batteries for...

453
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:24,259
The flashlight-- illuminates up to 50 yards.

454
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:27,810
Bug spray, radio, granola bars...
freeze-dried spaghetti?

455
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,651
Just add hot water, eat it out of the bag.

456
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,823
Am I going to find hot water in there?

457
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:32,837
You got to heat it up on the stove.

458
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:35,055
Oh... my god.

459
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:37,819
It's a bowie knife to cut fish,
cut tree limbs...

460
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:38,660
Amputate a leg?

461
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,375
Not a leg. It could do a foot.

462
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,302
Luke, this is your backcountry bag.
Why did you bring your backcountry bag?

463
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,102
I didn't know what this weekend was.

464
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:47,302
You didn't know we wouldn't be performing
surgery on each other?

465
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:48,345
I wanted to be prepared.

466
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:49,796
I thought this bag was full of clothes.

467
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:51,048
My other bag's full of clothes.

468
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:51,858
You're going to freeze.

469
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:53,569
It's plenty for me. I'm warm-blooded--

470
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:56,250
I know. I know you're warm-blooded.
Check it and see.

471
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:58,710
All right. Let's see what else they
have to eat out there, okay?

472
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:00,372
The freeze-dried spaghetti's
not going to do it for me.

473
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:01,762
I didn't mean to bring the spaghetti.

474
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:03,182
Come on. And leave the knife.

475
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,023
Okay.

476
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:09,847
- Morning.
- Good morning.

477
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:12,165
Hi, we've got coffee and pastries over there.

478
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,448
The best pastries on the island.

479
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,093
Yeah, you got to get them
early or they run out.

480
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:16,096
Even the prune is good.

481
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,009
She will not like the prune.

482
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,157
She'll like this prune.

483
00:17:18,257 --> 00:17:18,876
They look great.

484
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:19,795
Where's Luke?

485
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,251
He is waiting for my signal.

486
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:21,940
Your signal?

487
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,731
To come out. He wants a signal it's okay.

488
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:25,289
Got a flare gun in the garage.

489
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:27,509
Luke, it's okay! Come out.

490
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:29,194
Morning.

491
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:29,918
Hey, Luke.

492
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:31,827
Luke, you know, you don't have to hide.

493
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,366
I wasn't hiding. Did you say I was hiding?

494
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,155
I did not say that.

495
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,483
Help yourself to whatever.

496
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,703
You've got to read faster.

497
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:38,840
I read at my own pace,
regardless of peer pressure.

498
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:41,141
But my article is continued in the
section you've been reading

499
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:42,892
since before John wrote his gospel.

500
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:45,035
I keep telling her we need to buy two papers.

501
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,502
That's wasteful. We don't need two papers.

502
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:49,548
We need it for the help of the relationship.
There's your proof.

503
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,968
We got eggs and stuff, too, Luke.

504
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:51,722
You still hungry?

505
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:52,898
Still? You guys eat?

506
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:55,184
No, we just ate a big dinner last night.

507
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:56,139
Right.

508
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:58,916
Hey, why don't we take a
little walk first, huh?

509
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:00,654
The beach is deserted.
We'll have the whole thing to ourselves.

510
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,329
Okay.

511
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,205
You might want a coat.

512
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:03,010
I'm fine.

513
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:03,846
Oh, cool.

514
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:05,064
We won't be long.

515
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:06,178
Drat.

516
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,700
You snooze, you lose.

517
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:12,715
Smell that air-- sea-y.

518
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,224
Yeah, there's sewage somewhere, too.

519
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm loving this.

520
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:18,910
It's been forever since
I've been to the beach.

521
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,368
Can you imagine living here?

522
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:22,903
Wonder what real-estate prices are like.

523
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,403
Probably pretty high.

524
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:26,864
Bet you the Average Joe can't afford it,
that's for sure.

525
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:28,775
If you work here, you can't live here,

526
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,295
so you have to commute hours every day.

527
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:32,598
Pretty place to work, though.

528
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:34,269
Waves keep you up last night?

529
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:35,976
No, I knew you were awake, though.

530
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,447
Sorry, it's just it's so loud.

531
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:41,132
And just when I got back to sleep,
Dan shows up.

532
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,639
- Who?
- The raccoon.

533
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:44,480
- Stan.
- Oh, right.

534
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,593
He decided to play a sousa march
with the trash-can lids.

535
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:49,482
That's what a bowie knife's for.

536
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:50,683
Hey

537
00:18:57,773 --> 00:18:58,866
Nice out here, huh?

538
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,796
Beautiful.

539
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,073
You look like you're freezing.

540
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:01,826
I'm fine.

541
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,282
I forgot to give you these.

542
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:06,205
Oh, we finally earned your trust, huh?

543
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,713
We decided we'd risk it.

544
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,726
We're heading out.
We'll be back in a couple hours.

545
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:10,477
Where are you going?

546
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:11,243
The gym.

547
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:13,295
I'm sorry.
The ocean's awfully loud down here.

548
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:14,256
Where did you say you were going?

549
00:19:14,347 --> 00:19:15,065
The gym.

550
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:16,795
Sorry, the ocean is so loud--

551
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:19,186
Stop it.
We like to hit the gym when we're here.

552
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:20,467
I cannot picture this.

553
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,307
Well, stop mocking,
because it's a good thing.

554
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,071
I want to go just to see you at a gym.
You want to go?

555
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,907
Sure, I'll go.

556
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,803
Cool. Let's go.

557
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,070
Great, let's all go to the gym.

558
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,522
That will never stop being funny.

559
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,067
Hit me again, there, friend.

560
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:35,068
I needed that,
especially after that jog we took.

561
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:35,939
From the dressing room?

562
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:37,692
Yeah, it was at least 20 yards.

563
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:40,288
Plus the three steps we walked
up to get in the building.

564
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:41,650
That was some gnarly cardio.

565
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:45,371
What is it about cucumber water that makes
it so much more refreshing
than non-cucumber water?

566
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:46,858
I think it's the cucumber.

567
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:49,517
So, shall we resume our workout?

568
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,036
Let's do it.

569
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:53,862
You know, this is a nice facility.

570
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,787
I know, I like that you can get day passes.

571
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,248
You don't have to pay for a whole--

572
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:59,422
That was loud.

573
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,291
I think a little warning was in order.

574
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:03,366
No one remembers gym etiquette.

575
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:06,607
Hey, any idea what part of
the body this exercises?

576
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,666
I don't know.

577
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:09,886
Do you lift it or pull it?

578
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:12,000
Or push it or climb it?

579
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:14,309
So, the walk from the cucumber water to here,
that was, what,

580
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:15,440
another 20 calories?

581
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:16,932
Let's call it 40.

582
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,407
Hey, is Luke okay?

583
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:19,941
Because he seems a little distracted.

584
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:21,259
Oh, yeah, he's fine.

585
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:24,513
He's just not much of a traveler,
so it's all kind of foreign to him.

586
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:25,882
I want him to have a good time.

587
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,145
He will.

588
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,984
Yeah?

589
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:30,126
Okay if I work in?

590
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:31,503
Work in what?

591
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,254
Oh, you want to work in.

592
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,688
Yeah, I guess I'm done.

593
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,761
Boy, I'm going to be sore in the morning.

594
00:20:38,857 --> 00:20:40,410
Yeah, good reps there, mom.

595
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,591
Oh, you push with your arms.

596
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:45,271
I was going to say that.

597
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:46,304
More cucumber water?

598
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:48,283
I'm always up for more cucumber water.

599
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:51,127
God, I'll never get used to that.

600
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:56,404
- It's probably your shoes.
- Shoes are fine.

601
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,119
Yeah, but they're a size too
small and they're low-tops.

602
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,932
I bought what they had. The shoes are fine.

603
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:01,466
It's a drag you didn't bring your own gear.

604
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:02,720
Yeah, drag.

605
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:05,415
Let's get going here, all right?
I'm playing all out, so you play all out.

606
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,247
You're overestimating my skills if you don't
think I'm playing all out. It's what, 5-1?

607
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:09,904
6, you got 6-- 6-1.

608
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:11,341
Right, 6-1.

609
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:15,901
Sorry.

610
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:17,110
Don't apologize.

611
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:18,617
That was a foul, too. I charged.

612
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:19,786
You barely touched me.

613
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:20,522
I traveled.

614
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,603
No, you didn't foul me,
and you didn't travel.

615
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:23,573
Okay.

616
00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:25,632
Did you try loosening the laces?

617
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:27,092
Just check the ball.

618
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:28,570
6-1?

619
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:29,282
7, actually.

620
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:30,941
Right, right. 7.

621
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:31,715
Sorry.

622
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:32,862
Don't apologize.

623
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:41,875
Hey, guys.

624
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:42,913
What's going on?

625
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,508
Oh, wow.

626
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:46,745
I was, like, in a zen trance.

627
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,011
I was totally somewhere else.

628
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:50,201
Me too. I was in Greece. Where were you?

629
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,161
Bergdorf Goodman.

630
00:21:51,282 --> 00:21:53,477
When you reach a zen trance,
you go to Bergdorf Goodman?

631
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:55,413
To each his own. Thanks, Ron, Jerry.

632
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:56,809
Yeah, thanks, guys.

633
00:21:56,913 --> 00:21:58,199
I didn't know the gym had masseurs.

634
00:21:58,287 --> 00:21:58,733
They don't.

635
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,927
No, Ron and Jerry work for the laundry
service, but they missed their calling.

636
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:03,576
You got laundry guys to give you a massage?

637
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:06,409
Never underestimate the persuasive
powers of Lorelai Gilmore.

638
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:09,502
So, you guys have fun throwing
the old hoop around?

639
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:11,061
Or something to that effect.

640
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:14,586
Look at you. You look like a billboard for
the Martha's vineyard chamber of commerce.

641
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:15,448
It's all they had.

642
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:16,650
So, who won the game?

643
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:18,142
These shoes stink.

644
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:19,278
So you beat the shoes.

645
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:20,908
Nobody won. We just had fun.

646
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:22,383
Do you girls need to clean up at all?

647
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:23,394
From...?

648
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,029
Right, well, I guess we'll see you out here.

649
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:26,006
We'll be about 10 minutes.

650
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:27,724
Okay, see you in 10.

651
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,304
So what do we do?

652
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:33,017
Ron, Jerry, you got 10 minutes?

653
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:36,891
I love working out.

654
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:43,992
So what is this? Like, a fancy meal?

655
00:22:44,317 --> 00:22:47,184
I don't think it's fancy. It's just a meal.
They want us to make some meal.

656
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:50,232
But is it lunch or dinner? I mean,
it's at a weird time.

657
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:52,291
Well, I think they just want
us to eat in the daylight,

658
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:53,892
you know, so we could enjoy the view.

659
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:55,167
It's getting kind of foggy out.

660
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:56,406
It's still nice.

661
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,383
I had no idea it would be this cold.

662
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,764
I told you like a million times.

663
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:01,724
But not this cold,

664
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:04,479
and it doesn't help that the heat in
this place doesn't work very well.

665
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,568
Well, your full line of vineyard
swag should keep you toasty.

666
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,984
This stuff is cheap as hell.

667
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,634
The sweatpants I bought in the
gym ripped already. Logan...

668
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:12,766
Logan? What about him?

669
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:15,943
Well, he's the reason they ripped,
the way he was playing out there.

670
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:16,957
How was he playing?

671
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,583
I don't know. Annoying.

672
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:20,603
What was he doing, specifically,
to annoy you?

673
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:22,459
What wasn't he doing? He was mocking me,

674
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:26,174
traveling, fouling me without calling it,
cheating on the score.

675
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,696
And that spontaneously caused
your pants to rip?

676
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,945
You know what I mean.

677
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:32,038
He seemed nice when you guys
came back from the court.

678
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:33,530
He said you were just playing for fun.

679
00:23:33,616 --> 00:23:35,229
It wasn't fun, believe me.

680
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:36,897
Maybe you shouldn't have
come with us to the gym.

681
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:38,290
Nobody forced you to go.

682
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,999
I know.

683
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,766
I mean, it's Valentine's weekend, you know?

684
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,864
How about we stop talking about the
gym and the stupid basketball game?

685
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:45,684
Sure, okay, fine.

686
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:48,795
Look, they're probably waiting for us.
I'll just see you out there.

687
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:50,249
You got it.

688
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:56,882
I'm sorry,
but this picture just does not compute.

689
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:57,642
Stop.

690
00:23:57,744 --> 00:24:00,448
You're wielding a knife.
That's verboten in Gilmore world.

691
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:01,800
You forget that I'm a rebel.

692
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:02,871
And you're wearing an apron.

693
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,278
It's so my clothes don't get wrecked.

694
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:06,560
You've not worn an apron since
you saw "the sound of music"

695
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,226
and you put one on so you'd
look like sister Maria,

696
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:11,364
and you made a big crucifix
out of popsicle sticks.

697
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,495
Wow.

698
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:13,074
What?

699
00:24:13,171 --> 00:24:15,320
You went to that drawer and
got that thingamabob

700
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:16,707
like that's what you intended all along.

701
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:17,193
It was.

702
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:18,326
You know where things are.

703
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,365
I've cooked here before.

704
00:24:19,464 --> 00:24:20,843
I may need to be resuscitated.

705
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:22,895
Okay, do you want to help
or keep on the riff?

706
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,246
- Wanna help.
- Okay.

707
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,622
Logan is taking care of the
lobsters for us outside,

708
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:29,385
and I am making a salad, mashed potatoes,
and bruschetta.

709
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,781
Hmm. What's this?

710
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:32,484
It's a garlipress.

711
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,928
This would do a foot.

712
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:35,152
Step away from the knife.

713
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,073
What's this?

714
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,078
That's a lemon zester.

715
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:38,163
Let me zest a lemon.

716
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:38,572
No.

717
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:39,807
I get to do something.

718
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:41,320
Well, you can't just grab things.

719
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,035
Hi, Luke.

720
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:42,694
Hey.

721
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,176
Wash your hands, and I will give you a task.

722
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:44,972
Excellent.

723
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:45,681
Food looks good.

724
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:47,267
Rory's going to let me chop something.

725
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:48,022
Is that wise?

726
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:49,113
I did not say chop.

727
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:50,362
I'm ready.

728
00:24:50,463 --> 00:24:51,696
Okay. Chop the celery.

729
00:24:51,797 --> 00:24:52,385
Yay!

730
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:53,928
Oh, that's a dinner knife.

731
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,867
Well, be very careful, please.

732
00:24:55,976 --> 00:24:58,329
I am Mario Batali and Ina
Garten's love child.

733
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:00,530
Logan's outside dealing with the lobsters,
if you want to join him--

734
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,073
he was very nice, by the way.

735
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:05,274
He kept them well-hidden from me when
they were, let's say, not dead.

736
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:08,726
Not dead?
I don't like behind-the-scenes food stuff.

737
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:10,549
I'll see what's going on out there.

738
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:13,042
What did you mean, "it would do a foot"?

739
00:25:16,943 --> 00:25:18,207
Hey, they kick you out of the house?

740
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:18,986
Kind of.

741
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:19,846
You like lobster?

742
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,426
I never had lobster.

743
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,483
I think you'll like it if
I don't screw it up.

744
00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:26,344
Making lobster is time-honored
Huntzberger family tradition.

745
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,617
- It's in our blood.
- Great.

746
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,922
So FYI, I'm probably going to do
the present thing at dinner.

747
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:31,130
The present thing.

748
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:33,692
Just to give you a heads-up.
Don't want to complicate your life.

749
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:34,992
You got Rory a present.

750
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:36,407
For Valentine's day.

751
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,016
You forget?

752
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,472
- No.
- Okay.

753
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,710
I just didn't get her anything.

754
00:25:40,913 --> 00:25:43,843
I mean, Valentine's day isn't
technically till Tuesday.

755
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,491
Sure.

756
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,673
I have a couple of extra days.

757
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:46,570
Right.

758
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:49,669
Is there anything open nearby?

759
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:52,506
Only if you want a windbreaker
or some boating equipment.

760
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:53,180
Oh.

761
00:25:53,277 --> 00:25:55,566
Look, I went a little nuts and
got two things for Rory.

762
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,908
Let me give you one to give to Lorelai.

763
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,025
No, no, no, no.

764
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:01,700
Yes, I got a necklace and a tennis bracelet.
She doesn't need both.

765
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:02,958
Take one, whichever one.

766
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:04,144
I can't do that.

767
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,751
Dude, it's Valentine's day.
You've got to give your girl a gift.

768
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:10,406
Well... maybe I will take one.

769
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,100
Which one?

770
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,320
How about the necklace?

771
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:12,864
Perfect.

772
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:15,311
Mainly because I have no idea
what a tennis bracelet is.

773
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:17,778
Let me finish up getting these things on.
I'll take you in and show it to you.

774
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:19,488
I left them in the car so
Rory wouldn't find it.

775
00:26:19,592 --> 00:26:20,924
You really don't have to do this.

776
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,116
I'm happy to. We men got to stick together.

777
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:24,616
Okay.

778
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,020
This is fun.

779
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,884
You have got to stop doing that.

780
00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:31,304
I love the squishy feeling.

781
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:32,784
You're going to overmash them.

782
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:34,756
Is there such a thing as
overmashing potatoes?

783
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:36,348
Yes, it's called potato soup.

784
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:40,241
You know, you can put on the apron and shout
out things like "dice the carrots,"

785
00:26:40,352 --> 00:26:43,042
but implying that you can overmash
potatoes proves you're a phony.

786
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:45,632
You're the one who thought the potato
masher was a waffle shaper

787
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:46,783
before I corrected you.

788
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:50,001
Ow, I think I'm giving myself
mashed-potato elbow.

789
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:50,948
Would you like more chef's juice?

790
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:52,180
More wine would be great.

791
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:54,734
So, have I told you what we're thinking
for the end of the school year?

792
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:55,544
What who was thinking?

793
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:56,648
Logan and I.

794
00:26:56,808 --> 00:26:58,488
Get this-- Asia.

795
00:26:58,588 --> 00:26:59,691
Asia, wow.

796
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,071
Well, some of Asia--

797
00:27:01,177 --> 00:27:03,285
China, Thailand, Vietnam.

798
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:04,532
We're thinking six weeks.

799
00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:05,927
Sounds exciting, hon.

800
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,293
We haven't finalized anything yet,

801
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:09,749
but I bought the books,
I'm doing the research.

802
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:12,478
It's official. You've become too
fabulous to hang out with me.

803
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:13,422
How's it going in here?

804
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:15,166
It's good. I hope you like remashed potatoes.

805
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:16,167
You can eat them with a straw.

806
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:17,172
Where are you two headed?

807
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,076
I need the other tongs. They're in the garage

808
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,250
and Luke was going to help me find them.

809
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,769
Right. We'll be right back.

810
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:23,760
The clawed things out there,
they went peacefully.

811
00:27:24,137 --> 00:27:25,089
Thank you.

812
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,485
It's weird, you know?

813
00:27:29,587 --> 00:27:30,192
What's weird?

814
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:31,846
I don't know, it just hit me.

815
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:33,686
These could be the ones.

816
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:35,269
The ones?

817
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,405
The ones, you know?

818
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,079
Yeah.

819
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:41,222
Yeah.

820
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:48,214
Luke, weren't you a lobster neophyte?
Looks like you liked it.

821
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:50,498
It's good.
I can't believe I've never had it before.

822
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:51,533
You cooked them perfect.

823
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:52,474
Here here.

824
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,263
Thanks very much. You're too kind.

825
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,983
Not that I'm hunting for my own compliment,
but that celery I cut, huh?

826
00:27:58,091 --> 00:28:00,038
Let's hear it for the celery chopper.

827
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:02,355
Oh, this is so spontaneous and unexpected.

828
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,294
Not quite loud enough. Thank you, thank you.

829
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:05,411
So, should we clear?

830
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:07,677
It's so pretty out here,
sun will be down soon,

831
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:10,138
so before it gets dark,
happy Valentine's day.

832
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:14,012
Oh my god. You humanely killed lobsters
and you got me a present?

833
00:28:14,113 --> 00:28:15,536
I'm a multitasker.

834
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:18,021
It's a bracelet.

835
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:19,358
It's a tennis bracelet.

836
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:21,437
You know what a tennis bracelet is?

837
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:25,290
Well, my sister makes jewelry,
so I've picked up some terms.

838
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:26,498
Wow, I love it.

839
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:27,695
Happy Valentine's day.

840
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,109
Back at you, ace.

841
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:32,280
Well, I guess it's my turn.

842
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,488
Happy Valentine's day.

843
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,421
Really?

844
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:36,325
Really.

845
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:41,226
Oh, my god.

846
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:42,537
Luke, it's beautiful.

847
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:45,169
Good, good. It's going to look great on you.

848
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:46,284
Look at this.

849
00:28:46,956 --> 00:28:49,188
It's you. And it goes well with mine.

850
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,941
Oh, yeah, they're almost matching.

851
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,314
Yeah, Luke and I actually sneaked out

852
00:28:52,424 --> 00:28:53,643
when you two were playing
around in the kitchen.

853
00:28:53,747 --> 00:28:55,062
We found those in the same place.

854
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:56,315
Yep. Same shop.

855
00:28:56,422 --> 00:28:58,313
I can't believe you got me
a Valentine's day gift.

856
00:28:58,431 --> 00:28:59,429
Is it getting kind of cold?

857
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,135
Yeah, let's go in.
We'll clear all this later.

858
00:29:01,243 --> 00:29:02,384
Let's build a fire and get warm.

859
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:03,503
Excellent.

860
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,174
You like it?

861
00:29:06,274 --> 00:29:07,429
I love it.

862
00:29:07,532 --> 00:29:08,380
Good.

863
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:13,622
I really cannot believe I've never
had lobster before. I love it.

864
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,235
It's my favorite thing out of the sea now.

865
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:17,716
Kicks tuna's ass, kicks salmon's ass.

866
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,094
Yeah, it's good stuff.

867
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:20,990
Logan did a good job with it, too.

868
00:29:21,096 --> 00:29:24,776
We've got to find a good lobster
place near Stars Hollow.

869
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,245
Probably have to go to Litchfield.

870
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,116
I'm not even going to attempt the
lobster-house pancake world.

871
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:31,153
Do you know a good lobster place?

872
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:35,146
What's wrong? I thought you liked it.

873
00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:37,050
Oh, no, I do. It's beautiful.

874
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:38,380
So what is it?

875
00:29:38,498 --> 00:29:39,601
I don't know.

876
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:43,415
Lately, I've been feeling like
it's just not going to happen.

877
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,790
That what's not going to happen?

878
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:45,605
Our wedding.

879
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:49,443
No, Lorelai, that's crazy.
Of course it's going to happen.

880
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:50,931
But do you really want it to?

881
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:53,975
Yes. We're engaged. That hasn't changed.

882
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,015
The wedding's just been postponed.
That's all.

883
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:57,775
It's not feeling like it's postponed.

884
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,328
What happened?
I thought this would make you happy.
It's making you sad.

885
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:03,264
No, it's not, it's just...

886
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:08,356
I had to cancel a lot of stuff this week,
a lot of June 3rd stuff.

887
00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:09,608
June 3rd? But--

888
00:30:09,714 --> 00:30:13,439
Well, I was holding out hope that maybe,
if things calmed down with you a little bit,

889
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:15,367
it would still happen. It was just stupid.

890
00:30:15,464 --> 00:30:16,288
No.

891
00:30:16,476 --> 00:30:17,917
I lost all our deposits.

892
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:20,659
That doesn't matter.
We'll just put down new deposits.

893
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:21,475
Really?

894
00:30:21,597 --> 00:30:22,929
We're getting married.

895
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:24,698
I really want to believe that.

896
00:30:24,793 --> 00:30:28,559
Look, I know I've been preoccupied.
I don't like that about myself.

897
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:30,194
It's just who I am.

898
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:33,006
I get in my own head,
and I forget about the people around me.

899
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:35,305
I know, that's why I thought this
trip would be good for you,

900
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,663
get you thinking about something else,

901
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,474
but it's been cold here and
Logan's been bugging you

902
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:43,297
and the raccoon is noisy and the
waves were keeping you up.

903
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,143
I think the trip was a dumb idea.

904
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,380
Lorelai, no. It was a good idea.

905
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:49,424
Hey...

906
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:52,547
What?

907
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:54,189
You know I love you, right?

908
00:30:54,497 --> 00:30:56,678
I really need to hear that once in a while.

909
00:30:56,786 --> 00:30:58,643
I love you, and I'm going to marry you,

910
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,245
and at our wedding, we are having lobster.

911
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:04,588
Okay.

912
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:14,083
I really love this necklace.

913
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:29,068
Morning.

914
00:31:29,214 --> 00:31:30,137
Good morning.

915
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:33,418
How'd you sleep?

916
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:36,107
I slept great-- better than I have in months.

917
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:37,035
How about you?

918
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:39,028
Wonderfully, actually.

919
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:40,876
It's so quiet out there.

920
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:42,412
Just the waves.

921
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:43,888
They didn't keep you up?

922
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:45,927
No, I slept like a rock.

923
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,482
I wonder if Rory and Logan hit the gym again.
I'm going to go check.

924
00:31:49,582 --> 00:31:51,094
I wouldn't put it past them.

925
00:31:51,272 --> 00:31:53,471
Or maybe they went hang gliding,

926
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:58,057
went to climb a mountain, pearl diving,
or skeet shooting.

927
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,652
Wow!

928
00:31:59,762 --> 00:32:00,579
What?

929
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,208
Breakfast Santa's been here.

930
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:03,586
Breakfast Santa?

931
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:05,184
Wow.

932
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,636
Kids must have left it for us.

933
00:32:06,777 --> 00:32:09,755
Well, I don't think there's
really a breakfast Santa.

934
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,053
So, how do we do this?

935
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,049
Legs.

936
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:16,335
Service here is so excellent.

937
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:23,179
That must have been Harvey's beach.

938
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:26,118
Last time I was at the beach, I was like 18.

939
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:27,138
I was there--

940
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,907
when I was a kid, I used to go with
my friend Trish and her family.

941
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:32,680
It had that snack stand where the
cute boy worked. Remember?

942
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:34,183
He looked like Emilio Estevez.

943
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:36,425
Well, I remember the snack stand, not Emilio.

944
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,560
We used to do cartwheels
to get his attention.

945
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:41,654
I remember my sister picking
up someone's cigarette butt

946
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:43,650
behind that stand and smoking it.

947
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:47,211
You know, we could have been there at the
same time on the same day. Isn't that weird?

948
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,275
Nah, we never were.

949
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:49,050
How do you know?

950
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:52,688
Because you would have distracted
me from the snack-stand guy.

951
00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:54,370
And no guy ever did.

952
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:58,351
What about eloping?

953
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,069
What?

954
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,965
Eloping-- we can do that, right?
Instead of planning this whole big thing?

955
00:33:02,053 --> 00:33:03,471
I don't know. Maybe.

956
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:04,788
I guess we could.

957
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:07,170
But Rory has to come.
Is it still eloping if Rory comes?

958
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:08,975
Sure, why not? Let's start planning it.

959
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:10,953
You don't plan an elopement. You just do it.

960
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:12,586
Oh, right. That makes sense.

961
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:14,534
We could even come back and do it
here when the weather's better.

962
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:17,213
We could rent a place for a
couple weeks in the summer.

963
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:18,793
That sounds nice.

964
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:20,819
Whoa, loud.

965
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,149
Must be Rory and Logan.

966
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,181
In some kind of hurry.

967
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,690
You guys, we're up here!

968
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,789
In the interest of full disclosure,
we're fairly casual.

969
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,022
Who are you?

970
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:30,743
Who are you?

971
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,908
Mitchum Huntzberger.

972
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:32,718
Who are you?

973
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:34,936
Um, I'm Lorelai. I'm Rory's mother.

974
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:36,558
I'm looking for my son.

975
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:37,902
Dad!

976
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:46,965
Where the hell have you been?

977
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,111
What are you doing here?

978
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:49,732
You turn off your cell,
you turn off your pager.

979
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:50,960
I told you never turn off your pager.

980
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:52,120
I got your pages.

981
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:53,940
So you're ignoring them? That's great.

982
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,049
We're going to have it out in public?

983
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:57,639
We're not in public, Logan.
We're in my house.

984
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,130
Yeah, we're going to have it out here.

985
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:00,472
You didn't need me this weekend.

986
00:34:00,562 --> 00:34:02,784
You don't get to decide whether
you're needed or not.

987
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:04,652
I decide that. Do you hear me?

988
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:05,735
They heard you in Nantucket.

989
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:06,717
You were not to be here.

990
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:08,715
You were supposed to be on a red-eye
to London last night.

991
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,901
- I was in a room full of colleagues!
- I've met all of them!

992
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:13,424
Some of them actually come from
other bureaus to meet you,

993
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:15,829
and you blow it off to be with
your little girlfriend!

994
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:16,578
You embarrassed me!

995
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:18,193
You want to talk to me about embarrassment?

996
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:20,961
You listen to me.
You're getting on a plane to London.

997
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,319
You're getting on a plane to London today.

998
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:22,761
Dad!

999
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:25,171
And you're going to explain to my colleagues
why you wasted their Saturday

1000
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,730
and robbed them of their Sunday.

1001
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,943
And let me tell you this.
You better start acclimating yourself

1002
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:31,800
because you're in London for at least a year
starting the day after you graduate,

1003
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:33,514
- as we discussed.
- You discussed it.

1004
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,637
You're doing this, Logan,

1005
00:34:34,735 --> 00:34:36,880
and I'm driving you to the
airport myself right now.

1006
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:37,726
Get packed.

1007
00:34:37,763 --> 00:34:38,905
You've got 10 minutes.

1008
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:40,070
I have guests.

1009
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:41,480
Your guests can stay.

1010
00:34:41,586 --> 00:34:42,698
You're leaving!

1011
00:34:47,175 --> 00:34:48,132
Excuse me.

1012
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,233
Hey. Still here?

1013
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:03,378
Yeah, just waiting for Rory
to get her things.

1014
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,578
You need any help there?

1015
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,074
No, thanks, Luke.

1016
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,348
No problem. I just have to get that last bag.

1017
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:17,492
I'm really, really sorry about this.

1018
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:19,258
Oh, hey, it's okay.

1019
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,344
It was fun while it lasted.

1020
00:35:25,136 --> 00:35:28,740
No one understands letting family
down better than I do.

1021
00:35:29,114 --> 00:35:30,595
- Hi.
- Hi.

1022
00:35:31,364 --> 00:35:32,429
Walk you out?

1023
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:48,862
Intimidating.

1024
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:54,468
So, a full year in London.

1025
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:55,725
Yeah.

1026
00:35:56,711 --> 00:35:59,029
So, when do you move, exactly?

1027
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:02,242
The Asia thing...

1028
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:05,274
I guess that's on the back burner?

1029
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:11,642
Do you have to leave the very day after
you graduate or is there a cushion or--

1030
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:13,941
Stop. It's not happening. Okay?

1031
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:16,492
Not yet. It's February.
We don't have to think about this right now.

1032
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,242
Right now, it doesn't even exist, okay?

1033
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,490
I'm not going to think about it.
Let's not think about it.

1034
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,124
Okay.

1035
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:23,377
Take the Porsche home and keep planning Asia.

1036
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,184
I've got all my books with me.

1037
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:26,185
Good.

1038
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:39,841
So that's Mitchum, huh?

1039
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:42,143
It's just like I imagined him.

1040
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:53,110
Hey, Caesar.

1041
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,895
Luke, you're back early. How was it?

1042
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,747
Great.

1043
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:57,612
Ended dramatically, but, yeah.

1044
00:36:57,711 --> 00:36:58,831
Well, welcome back.

1045
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:00,414
There was something I was
supposed to tell you.

1046
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,355
Was it important?

1047
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:02,619
Must not have been.

1048
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:05,426
Well, I'll take care of out here.
Why don't you close out the back?

1049
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:08,036
Sure. Coffee's fresh. Maybe that was it.

1050
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:09,644
- Was that it?
- No.

1051
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:11,480
Well, I'd love some coffee.

1052
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:12,566
Coming up.

1053
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,413
Okay.
What am I going to do with all that stuff?

1054
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:18,067
Keep it. It looked good on you,
especially the sweatpants.

1055
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,047
You got nice mass ass.

1056
00:37:20,106 --> 00:37:20,654
A what?

1057
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:21,878
Massachusetts ass.

1058
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:23,698
Well, maybe I'll keep those then.

1059
00:37:23,805 --> 00:37:25,955
I remember. Your daughter-- I'm an idiot.

1060
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:26,517
What?

1061
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:27,741
That's what I had to tell you--

1062
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:30,142
April kept calling to confirm the
time she's coming over tomorrow.

1063
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:31,624
- Oh, she did?
- 3:00--

1064
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,853
she kept calling to remind me like
I wouldn't remember to tell you,

1065
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:35,157
which I almost didn't.

1066
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,010
She's pretty smart.

1067
00:37:36,107 --> 00:37:37,856
Yeah, thanks, Caesar.

1068
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:42,080
Uh...

1069
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:46,396
So, 3:00 tomorrow.

1070
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:50,114
I guess her mother will pick
her up around 7:00, so...

1071
00:37:50,216 --> 00:37:54,059
Great. So, I'll pop up sometime after that.

1072
00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:54,726
Okay.

1073
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:56,526
Oh, and her bike-- it's at my place.

1074
00:37:56,629 --> 00:38:01,448
Right. Right, I guess I'll...
pick it up tomorrow before 3:00.

1075
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:02,789
Sure, anytime.

1076
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:06,801
You know, um, I'm just kind of tired.
I don't need to wire myself up again.

1077
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,181
I think I'm just going to go home.

1078
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,103
Oh, okay.
I'll just tell Caesar I'm taking you.

1079
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:13,438
No, that's okay. That's okay.
I think I'm going to walk.

1080
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,102
You sure?

1081
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:16,751
Yeah, yeah, stay here.
I'll get my bags tomorrow

1082
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,368
or you can bring them when
you come get April's bike.

1083
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:21,877
Sure, whatever you want. It's cold out there,
you know?

1084
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:22,839
I know.

1085
00:38:22,953 --> 00:38:24,345
Cold can be nice sometimes.

1086
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:25,416
See you tomorrow.

1087
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:26,892
- Okay.
- Okay.

1088
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:49,195
Lorelai, it's your aunt Alice.

1089
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:52,635
Jim and I saw the beautiful picture of you
in the paper announcing your engagement.

1090
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:55,267
How wonderful, and what a wonderful picture.

1091
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:57,956
I told Emily that you looked so young.

1092
00:38:58,055 --> 00:39:01,502
We marked our calendar for June 3rd,
and we look forward to it.

1093
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:05,388
And we're really looking forward to
meeting this man of yours, as well.

1094
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:07,529
A restaurant tour, it says.

1095
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:11,516
Say hello to Rory for us,
and we'll see you soon. Bye.

1096
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:15,224
Hello, this is Amelda Landers,
and I'm of the DAR with your mother

1097
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,016
and of course you went to school for
a period with my daughter Carol.

1098
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:21,679
I told Carol I would pass her congratulations
on to you for the announcement.

1099
00:39:21,766 --> 00:39:24,500
So that's it. Picture's beautiful. Goodbye.

1100
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,186
Hello, Lorelai, it's your uncle James.

1101
00:39:27,293 --> 00:39:29,541
Emily called to tell us to
save the date-- June 3rd.
