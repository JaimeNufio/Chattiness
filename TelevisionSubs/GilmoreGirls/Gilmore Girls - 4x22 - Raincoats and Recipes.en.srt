1
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,655
Oh, hi! Great!

2
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:12,767
I'm still on my finals sleep schedule, and, man, am I wired.

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,329
What time is it? Like, 3:00 in the morning? I cannot tell anymore.

4
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:19,829
Want some mac and cheese? I love mac and cheese when I can't sleep.

5
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,512
Cool. Individual cheese slices.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,131
So, I've been making out my résumé so I can try to get a summer job,

7
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:30,647
because there is no way that I am going to swipe cafeteria cards again next year.

8
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:31,795
My whites are done.

9
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:35,645
Do you know that the best time to do your laundry at Yale is in the middle of the night?

10
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:38,179
You have your pick of washers, the place has just been swept,

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,287
and the trash is completely empty. So, what do you think?

12
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:45,759
The Stars Hollow Gazette needs a facts checker, but Rob's Tire is offering way more money.

13
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:50,334
I know that now is the time to suffer for my art, but I was so broke by the end of the year

14
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:52,781
that I had to dip into Paris' green tea stash,

15
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:55,085
which backfired on so many levels, I can't even tell you.

16
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,312
Great to have you home, hon.

17
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,622
Okay, I think I've got all the rooms assigned for the test run.

18
00:02:03,695 --> 00:02:06,434
- Hit me. 
- Miss Patty is in room one, Babette is in two.

19
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:10,182
I put Taylor in three, the corner room. The Siegels will go in five,

20
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:13,003
- you and Rory are in six... 
- Wait, what happened to four?

21
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:13,843
Four is taken.

22
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:15,973
- By whom? 
- By friends of mine.

23
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,244
- Sookie and Jackson are in...
- Which friends of yours?

24
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:20,110
You said I could invite friends of mine, did you not?

25
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:21,938
- I did. 
- Okay, so I did that.

26
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,292
I invited two of my friends, and I put them in room four,

27
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:27,939
and now room four is taken with my friends as you suggested, okay?

28
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:31,445
Paw-paw and Chin Chin cannot come to the test run.

29
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:34,144
- Why not? 
- Because they are dogs, Michel.

30
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,284
They cannot stay home by themselves.

31
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,736
They get lonely and they eat expensive Italian things.

32
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:42,176
Then get yourself a Chow sitter, because room four is for human beings only.

33
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:43,959
Terrific, they're on their way up.

34
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:47,409
Oh, hey, Tom, I'm putting Post-its where we need paint touch-ups.

35
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:48,069
Got it.

36
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:51,609
And, you know, we got that test run Saturday. I was really hoping to have some doors by then.

37
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:54,510
- I told you, the doors are coming. 
- You told me that two weeks ago.

38
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:56,252
- And I'm sure I meant it. 
- Tom!

39
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,562
I'm calling right now.

40
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:01,033
I don't understand why you get to bring Rory, and I don't get to bring my Chows.

41
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:03,030
Because I'm mad with power.

42
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:06,922
They are cleaner than she is. They are quieter than she is.

43
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:09,543
Stop comparing your dogs to my kid.

44
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:12,964
As much as you love Rory, that is how much I love Paw-paw and Chin Chin.

45
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,402
I gave birth to her! I carried her inside me,

46
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:17,709
and nine months and twenty-six hours later, she came out!

47
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:21,324
If I could have given birth to them myself, I would have, but I didn't have that choice!

48
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,423
I think that's enough wood there, Kirk.

49
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:26,476
I put wood in all the guest rooms and the living room,

50
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:28,533
so all I have to do is store the rest of the cord you bought.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,684
Okay, Michel will take you outside and show you where it goes.

52
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,602
Outside? Do you really want to expose your wood to the elements?

53
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:36,735
- We'll get a tarp. Michel? 
- Any dogs, Kirk?

54
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:38,775
Dogs urinate on wood. I hate dogs.

55
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,513
Going with Kirk on his rounds again, Lulu?

56
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,569
I just love it when he looks like the Brawny paper towel guy.

57
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:45,578
It is a good outfit.

58
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,528
The place looks absolutely wonderful, Lorelai. When does it open?

59
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,864
Two weeks, but we're having a test run on Saturday,

60
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:53,509
just a bunch of friends who will hopefully still be our friends on Monday.

61
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:54,983
Sounds wonderful.

62
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,929
- Hey, You and Kirk should come. 
- Really?

63
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,925
Sure. I'll give you Paw-paw and Chin Chin's room. We'd love to have you.

64
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:01,599
Wow, we would love to come.

65
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:04,318
And I know Kirk would feel better being able to check up on the wood.

66
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,473
Kirk's lucky to have found you, Lulu.

67
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:11,311
Oh, pretty garnish! That's some good mincing there.

68
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:14,987
Just enough walnut. Is that fish done? It should be done. Perfect.

69
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,783
Ooh, man, it smells great in here.

70
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,112
This is the best kitchen staff I've ever had, ever!

71
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,371
I don't know how we got them, but they're amazing!

72
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:25,822
- I got to show you this mincing. Seriously… 
- No, no, no, no. I believe you.

73
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:30,149
They seem terrific. But, Sookie, so there are seven workers in here,

74
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,386
- and we're only budgeted for five. 
- I know.

75
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:33,993
- That's a problem. 
- Yes.

76
00:04:34,352 --> 00:04:38,592
See, I hired seven, figuring that at least two would crap out, and then we'd have five.

77
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:39,901
- And? 
- And none did.

78
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,370
- So what do we do? 
- I don't know.

79
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:43,659
Well, maybe the test run will break a couple of them,

80
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:46,036
but if no one quits, honey, you got to fire two of them.

81
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:51,703
There are all sorts of chromosomes missing from that man.

82
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:54,510
- Put Kirk and Lulu in room four. 
- You cut me.

83
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,990
- Okay, so is that it for the rooms? 
- Basically, yes. You and Rory in six, Luke in seven.

84
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,653
- Luke? 
- Yes, Luke

85
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:04,078
- Oh! So is he coming? Luke's coming? 
- Is he not supposed to?

86
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:07,608
No, no, of course he was. I mean, he was invited quite a while ago...

87
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:11,437
before anything happened. I mean, I didn't know he was coming, that's all.

88
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:14,252
Okay, so good. Luke's in room seven.

89
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:16,126
Lucky number seven.

90
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:19,270
Not that it's lucky for Luke, 'cause I don't know what's lucky for Luke, okay?

91
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,322
Look at how he chopped these onions.

92
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:24,472
I just want to shove a string through them and wear them around my neck!

93
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,774
- That wouldn't be at all eccentric. 
- Oh! Oh, honey, come here.

94
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,322
What is that for?

95
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:35,029
In all the craziness, I completely forgot that today is your wedding anniversary.

96
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,636
Oh, my god!

97
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,611
- Where'd he go? 
- I don't know.

98
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:03,757
- What do I do? 
- I don't know!

99
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,967
- Did I lose? 
- Well, you have no head, so probably.

100
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,261
So this is what teenage boys are doing instead of watching television?

101
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:12,324
- Apparently. 
- Seems like a lateral move.

102
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:14,229
- Hey, you hungry? 
- I'm starving.

103
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:18,032
Well, your timing is perfect, 'cause I went to the store yesterday.

104
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:21,238
Are you kidding me? You just got away from the floorboard life.

105
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:26,097
Boys will eat everything. I bought vanilla-almond body lotion the other day.

106
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,170
- No. 
- On chips -- mine, by the way.

107
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:32,272
So, Jess came by to see me.

108
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:36,138
You've been here 20 minutes, and you drop this now?

109
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,354
He just showed up at my dorm on Saturday night.

110
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,039
- Why? What did he say? 
- Well...

111
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:40,699
Wait!

112
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:45,072
- Go. 
- I got home from this awful setup.

113
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:46,167
The guy your grandmother brought by?

114
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:47,483
- That's the one. 
- He was that bad?

115
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,351
- James Spader in "Pretty in Pink." 
- You could have just stopped at "James Spader."

116
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:54,031
Anyway, I left the pub, got back to my dorm, and Jess was there.

117
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:56,306
- What did he want? 
- He wanted me to come away with him.

118
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:59,634
- Oh, my God! What did you say? 
- I said -- I don't know.

119
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:03,943
It was so weird. He was just... Jess.

120
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:08,321
I mean, he shows up out of no where with this crazy proposal. It was awful.

121
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,005
- It doesn't sound awful. 
- What are you talking about?

122
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:13,355
- Jess bailed on me twice. 
- I know, but how incredibly romantic

123
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,519
to have this guy show up out of the blue and want to take you away with him.

124
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:19,652
When I first met Jess, I thought, "What could be better than this?

125
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,566
He's smart, good taste in books and music, so cute."

126
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:25,935
But Jess is great one minute and then the next...

127
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:29,191
you know, as far as I know, I could have said yes, packed my bag,

128
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,428
and by the time I got to the car, he would have changed his mind.

129
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,434
- It's part of why he's cute. He's unpredictable. 
- I guess.

130
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:37,968
You know, when I was with Dean, I always knew

131
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:40,455
that no matter what happened, he would be there.

132
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:43,061
- Dean was very dependable. 
- It was more than that.

133
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:46,681
He's... well, he was so...

134
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:52,083
I was safe, and he was so nice to me.

135
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:55,170
- He really loved you. 
- I think I really blew it there, you know?

136
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:59,185
- I didn't appreciate it. 
- Every girl has to fall for a bad boy.

137
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:02,308
It's the rule. It's the reason so many accountants eventually get married.

138
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:12,097
Hey, she's a piratey soul, full of vinegar and glitter,

139
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:19,773
she is a song of her own, from down the wrong end of the river,

140
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:27,647
wild like the lily-a-passion, have you ever had the honors

141
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:33,858
Oh, no, no, no, no, no way

142
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,732
- I can't believe you didn't wake me up. 
- Me and what army?

143
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:45,069
I only have so much time off. I don't want to waste it all sleeping till noon.

144
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:47,062
There was no waking you up. You were completely out of it.

145
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:48,571
We're talking Farrah on "Letterman."

146
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:50,078
- Hey. 
- What?

147
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:52,191
Luke is coming over here. I want you to pay very close attention.

148
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:53,559
- To what? 
- Coffee?

149
00:08:53,677 --> 00:08:56,943
Oh, sure, coffee would be great. Coffee, hon? Yeah, she'll have coffee.

150
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:58,767
Okay. You want a minute?

151
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,421
- Yes, a minute would be great. 
- Okay.

152
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:02,447
- Well? 
- What?

153
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,799
- You notice anything? 
- Anything?

154
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,328
- Anything weird, anything different? 
- About Luke?

155
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,489
Of course about Luke. Did you notice anything different?

156
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:11,156
- Like what? 
- Like a vibe, an attitude.

157
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:13,353
- Did he look at me differently? 
- Differently than what?

158
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:15,447
- Differently than he did. 
- Differently than he did when?

159
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,619
- Before. 
- Before what?

160
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:18,279
Before before. Rory!

161
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:20,920
How on earth can you be frustrated with me right now?

162
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:26,956
What's your damage, Heather?

163
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,585
- I think I'm dating Luke. 
- What?

164
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:34,068
I'm not sure. It's just a possibility. I could be wrong.

165
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:36,434
But how? When?

166
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,428
I went with him to his sister's wedding, and it was really nice. We had a really good time.

167
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,044
We laughed a lot, and we ate, and then we danced.

168
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:44,904
- Danced? How? 
- We pop-locked.

169
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,397
Was it a fast dance, slow dance, group dance?

170
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,856
- It was a slow dance. What is "group dance?" 
- The hustle, the hora.

171
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,147
No hustle, no hora. It was a slow dance -- a waltz. Luke can waltz.

172
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,554
- Luke can waltz?! 
- Luke can waltz.

173
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,278
Look how you just said, "Luke can waltz."

174
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,603
What, I'm just saying, I'm surprised that Luke can waltz.

175
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,245
That sounded more like, "I'm surprised I still have my clothes on."

176
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:03,801
- Oh, stop. 
- What else happened?

177
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:06,771
Nothing. We spent the evening together. We danced, he walked me home,

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,221
then he asked me to a movie. All of these things individually do not add up to dating,

179
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:13,084
but together, I don't know. And there was this moment,

180
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:16,231
when he walked me home, where I thought -- I don't know.

181
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:17,174
Did you say yes?

182
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:19,073
- When? 
- To the movie.

183
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:20,077
- Did you say yes? 
- Yes.

184
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,544
- That sounds like dating to me. 
- But maybe he didn't mean it as a date thing.

185
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:25,060
Maybe he just needed to get out of the house,

186
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:26,913
and since I'm currently one of the women sitting home,

187
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,673
thinking, "If I could only find a man like Aragorn," he picked me.

188
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,305
- Okay, whoa, this is Luke. 
- I know.

189
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:36,395
Our Luke -- the town Luke. We see him every day. He's a part of our lives.

190
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,101
- I know. 
- I mean, everyone will know.

191
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,132
They'll know if you're together, they'll know if you're not together.

192
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:41,972
- I know. 
- You can't just date Luke.

193
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:44,070
When you're with Luke, you are with Luke.

194
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:47,307
And if it doesn't work out, it will be really bad for both of us.

195
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:50,209
I mean, how do you feel about this? Do you want to be dating Luke?

196
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:52,006
Okay, we're getting ahead of ourselves here.

197
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:55,744
I don't even know if this is what he's thinking. This could be a totally innocent situation,

198
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:57,797
and then we've done all this what-iffing for nothing.

199
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:01,160
Let's just go back in there and see if anything's weird, okay?

200
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:02,231
- Okay. 
- Okay.

201
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,854
- Is everything okay? 
- Yes.

202
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:12,788
I'll get the broom.

203
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,232
That was a little weird.

204
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:38,429
- Two radish roses for a carrot curl? 
- Deal.

205
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,521
- You're trading garnish? 
- Yes, but only 'cause the dinner's gross.

206
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,276
- Very nice. 
- I don't like rabbit.

207
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:45,818
How convenient. You're not eating rabbit.

208
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:48,220
- But this is rabbit sauce. 
- It is rabbit sauce.

209
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:50,975
It is not rabbit sauce. Do not tell her that it's rabbit sauce.

210
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,904
It tastes like rabbit sauce to me.

211
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:55,910
That just goes to show how much attention you give to meals that are prepared for you.

212
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,454
- If it isn't rabbit, then what is it? 
- It's duck.

213
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:01,316
- Oh, well, where's that carrot curl? 
- I haven't seen a radish rose.

214
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:04,384
Never mind. Don't eat it. Sriva, come get the plates. We're done.

215
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:07,041
- Not everyone is done. 
- Just bring out the dessert, please.

216
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,383
So, Rory, I was thinking maybe we should go away this summer, just you and me.

217
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:14,726
You should do Europe right at least once in your life, and this seems like the perfect time.

218
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:18,401
Oh, well, Grandma, I don't really know what I'm doing this summer yet,

219
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:21,505
- but that sounds really nice. 
- And really out of the blue.

220
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:23,480
- I agree. 
- Were you going mention this to me?

221
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:25,812
- I just did. 
- No, before you opened the peanuts.

222
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:28,228
Plans aren't made, Lorelai. It was just an idea.

223
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,567
If Rory doesn't want to go, then Rory doesn't have to go.

224
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,053
Rory didn't say she didn't want to go.

225
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:36,583
That's right, Rory's mother was just marveling at the "hey, look over here" approach to the invitation.

226
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:38,417
You okay, dad?

227
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,882
I'm fine. When is dessert? I have work to do.

228
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:44,770
It's coming as quickly as the woman can spoon fruit over ice cream.

229
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:49,383
Well, clearly, she has carpal tunnel or some other modern disease which is slowing her down.

230
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:52,686
If she's going too slow for you, why don't you just go into the kitchen and give her a hand?

231
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,840
I forgot to mention, we're doing a test run at the inn this weekend.

232
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:56,582
What?

233
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,825
Yeah, we're inviting all our friends to spend the weekend,

234
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:01,872
- just to make sure we're ready to open. 
- Well, that sounds sensible.

235
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:04,974
Hey, you know what would be great? If the two of you came.

236
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:06,356
- What? 
- For the weekend.

237
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,621
- Oh. 
- Well...

238
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:11,632
I mean, I've been working toward this goal for, my God, what is it, Rory, now, twenty years?

239
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:13,930
- Twenty years. 
- Twenty years, wow.

240
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,293
So basically, this is the biggest thing that's ever happened to me in my life,

241
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,877
except for Rory being born, and I'm sure my parents wouldn't want to miss it.

242
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,707
I mean, unless there's some specific reason why you guys can't come,

243
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,227
both of you together. No? Okay, good, so you'll be there.

244
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,019
Fantastic. Isn't that great, Rory?

245
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:35,991
Grandma and Grandpa are coming to the test run together.

246
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,272
Lorelai...

247
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:40,322
Dad, seriously, you have no idea how much this means to me.

248
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,409
We wouldn't miss it for the world.

249
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,470
So, inviting them to stay in the inn is going to do what?

250
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:54,255
I'm not inviting them to stay in the inn. I'm inviting them to stay in the bungalow

251
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,549
- 150 feet away from the inn. 
- Diabolical.

252
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:59,227
I'm going to lock those two in a room, and they are either coming out reconciled

253
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,551
or in a body bag. Believe you me, I'm fine either way.

254
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:03,403
Well, look who died and made you Hayley Mills.

255
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,255
- Hey Kirk, just sit... 
- We need to talk.

256
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:09,323
Where are you going? Hey!

257
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:13,926
Get out of my apartment.

258
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:17,377
This place is small. I always pictured you in a bigger place.

259
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,599
Do me a favor and don't picture me in any place, okay, Kirk?

260
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,893
You have nice windows, though. I don't have windows.

261
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:24,457
My room at my mom's house used to be a bomb shelter.

262
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:27,811
- It's very cold but great for racquetball. 
- Kirk, what do you want?

263
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,486
I need to talk to you.

264
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:32,548
- You're the only one I can confide in. 
- Oh, goody.

265
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,843
Lorelai invited Lulu and me to the test run of the inn.

266
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:40,458
Lulu is very excited about the invitation.

267
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,924
It's all she talks about -- a romantic weekend at the inn with me.

268
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:49,849
Anyhow, I'm a little concerned about this invitation, because...

269
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,788
- Lulu and I have never spent the night together. 
- Oh well, this is not a comfortable area for me.

270
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:58,599
- I mean, we've had sex -- lots and lots of sex. 
- And this is even more uncomfortable.

271
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,957
- We just haven't actually spent the night together.
- Why not?

272
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,406
I have night terrors.

273
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:07,349
- Night terrors? 
- Basically, I freak out at beddy-bye.

274
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:10,036
About an hour after I fall asleep, I wake up in panic.

275
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:14,106
Everything around me seems threatening, scary, out to get me.

276
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:17,225
Two nights ago, I was suddenly gripped with the overwhelming feeling

277
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,119
- that there was an assassin in my house. 
- Jeez.

278
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:21,203
I had to get out of the room before he got me,

279
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,905
so I jumped out of bed and locked my pillow in the bathroom.

280
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,467
- Why? 
- Because it was a bomb.

281
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,755
- Of course. 
- After neutralizing my pillow,

282
00:15:28,857 --> 00:15:31,506
I ran up the stairs, climbed out the bathroom window,

283
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:34,325
scaled the trellis up the side of the house, and hid on the roof…

284
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:36,881
- Completely naked. 
- Aw, jeez!

285
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,974
The worst part of night terrors is it always ends up with me

286
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:43,992
on top of the roof completely naked or running down the street completely naked

287
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:46,634
or swimming in the community-center pool completely naked.

288
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,488
That was the time I thought I was on fire.

289
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,583
Kirk, that's terrible.

290
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:54,002
Well, I'm used to it now, so it's kind of second nature to me, but Lulu...

291
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,419
- Right, Lulu. 
- How is she going to take it?

292
00:15:56,557 --> 00:16:01,345
I mean, I could scare her or ninja-kick her and lock her up with a pillow.

293
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,442
I think I love her, Luke,

294
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,661
and I haven't even told her that I love her.

295
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:10,038
I spelled it out in chocolate-covered Oreos once, but she was really hungry,

296
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:11,866
and I'm not sure if she read it first.

297
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:15,731
I can't assault her before I tell her I love her.

298
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,048
What do you want me to do about it?

299
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:21,629
I called the Dragonfly and had them put me and Lulu in the room right next to yours.

300
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,920
That way, if you hear anything -- screaming or Russian --

301
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,466
you can come in and pull me off of Lulu.

302
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:31,410
Unless, when you come in, it looks like you shouldn't pull me off of Lulu.

303
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:33,283
- Kirk. 
- You can use your judgment on that one.

304
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:35,505
- Kirk, I don't know about this. 
- Please!

305
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:38,941
This weekend means so much to her. I can't tell her we're not going.

306
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:41,408
Fine.

307
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:43,892
Thank you, Luke, thank you.

308
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:47,731
- Remember, anything weird, just jump on in. 
- I got it, Kirk.

309
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:50,333
Just don't touch my bottom, or I'll think you have a machete.

310
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:54,890
If you want this to happen, do not use the word "bottom" with me again, Kirk.

311
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:56,298
Right. See you later.

312
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:58,311
- Hey, Luke? 
- What, Kirk?

313
00:16:58,944 --> 00:17:00,112
What kind of clothes are you bringing?

314
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:05,099
My kitchen staff's great -- all seven of them!

315
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:06,047
Hang in there, Sookie.

316
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,509
If only one would suck, maybe it would rub off on the rest.

317
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:11,213
Plenty of sucking potential still out there, have some faith.

318
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,741
Tom, where are my doors? They were supposed to be here by now.

319
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:16,603
Yeah, I know. They took a wrong turn and headed to Woodbridge.

320
00:17:17,064 --> 00:17:19,210
- What? 
- Relax, I'm trying to track them down.

321
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:22,600
Tom, guests are showing up here any second.

322
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,410
They have no doors. People will have to get very friendly very quickly.

323
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,843
I got the guy on the phone. I'll get right back to you.

324
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,461
Tom? Tom?

325
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,333
Hey, I've changed my mind. I want to be a ballerina.

326
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:34,878
- Good timing. 
- Okay. So, we don't have doors,

327
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:38,282
and every single person I hired is fantastic. We're doomed.

328
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:41,727
The guests are arriving. I repeat, the guests are arriving.

329
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,672
No, Michel, we still don't have doors. Is there anything you can do to stall them?

330
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,371
No. I'm bringing them up now.

331
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:49,254
Boy, if he was on my kitchen staff, we'd be home free by now.

332
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:51,267
- I got 'em. 
- Doors? You got the doors?

333
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:54,078
They're on their way up. My guys will be standing by to get them on.

334
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,735
Tom, I'm loving you like a two dollar whore.

335
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:58,312
- Terrific. I'll tell the wife. 
- Okay.

336
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,948
Everybody, the doors are on the way, guests are coming.

337
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:03,523
Everybody outside to greet them. It's showtime. Let's go!

338
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,478
Okay, everyone, remember, these people are not our friends.

339
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,930
They are customers. Just relax, don't rush, and don't kill anybody.

340
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:10,912
Here they come!

341
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,461
Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Dragonfly Inn.

342
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:34,244
- Oh, will you look at this place! 
- It's a paradise.

343
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:38,156
Oh, Lorelai, the babies that are going to be conceived on this property!

344
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,100
Oh, are those horses! Babette, look at the horses.

345
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:44,484
That's Cletus and Desdemona, and if anyone would like to go for a ride,

346
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:45,842
Michel can set it up for you.

347
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:48,570
The ride up here was very dusty, Lorelai.

348
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:52,043
You should warn people not to wear their white pants upon arrival.

349
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,191
- I will do that, Taylor. 
- So, do I bring my own bags in or…?

350
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:57,951
No, you don't. Eric, Jeremy, Sam, these bags, please.

351
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,394
The blue one has breakables.

352
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:04,515
Okay, they're unloading them in the back. I already sent Dean in to start putting them up.

353
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,174
- Great. Thank you, Tom. 
- I'll be right back.

354
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:07,142
Make sure the keys are ready.

355
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,356
Well, hey there, you two! Good to see you!

356
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,746
I am so excited to be here. Thank you so much for the invitation.

357
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,454
- You're welcome. Have a good time. 
- Oh, horses.

358
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,989
- Is Luke here yet? 
- No, he's not, Kirk.

359
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,323
But he's coming, right? He'll be here before I go to sleep?

360
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,863
- I have no idea, Kirk. Why? 
- It's a guy thing.

361
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:39,746
I have to get this upstairs.

362
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:41,977
- Can't we talk? 
- What about?

363
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,707
- He didn't stay. 
- Yeah. I don't care.

364
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:47,722
I told him to go. He went. He's gone.

365
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:49,857
- Well, great. 
- Why are you so mad?

366
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,349
- I'm not mad. I'm working. 
- I left you three messages. You didn't answer any of them.

367
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,685
You blew me off at Luke's today. You won't look me in the eye.

368
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,650
I have to go.

369
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,572
- I told him to leave. 
- You told me to leave, also.

370
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:07,665
- I told you to leave so I could tell him to leave. 
- That makes sense.

371
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:12,856
It does make sense, Dean. I didn't ask him to come. I did ask you to come, remember?

372
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:16,596
- I know. I just...
- What -- why are you so mad?

373
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:19,851
 I thought you were back with him or something.

374
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:22,728
- No, I'm not back with him. 
- I thought you were.

375
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:23,731
Well, I'm not.

376
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,739
But even if I was back with him, why would it bother you so much?

377
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:30,219
I don't like him.

378
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,343
And I don't want you with him.

379
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:38,626
Right.

380
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:43,877
Because he doesn't treat me right, right?

381
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,413
Right.

382
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,333
And you wouldn't want me to be with someone who doesn't treat me right, because…

383
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:54,504
you're my friend, right?

384
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:57,423
Right...

385
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:00,663
I'm your friend.

386
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:06,680
Dean! How we doing with those doors?

387
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,420
We're doing fine, Tom.

388
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,880
There you go, Freddy, you're in room nine. Just follow your door.

389
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:29,151
Oh, honey, this place is spectacular.

390
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,679
Thanks, Patty. You're in room one. I hope you like it.

391
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,805
Oh, I just know everything's going to be perfect.

392
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:37,404
There is nothing that you could do that I wouldn't love.

393
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,976
No, that is not the point here. This is a test run.

394
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:42,965
We need to work out all the kinks this weekend so they don't happen again,

395
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:45,519
so we're depending on your feedback, and especially your criticism.

396
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:48,726
- All right, I promise to be a pain. 
- I appreciate that.

397
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:50,788
Just follow your door to your room.

398
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:54,132
After you, sweetheart.

399
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:58,453
Well, you can count on me for my feedback, Lorelai. I promise you that.

400
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,794
In fact, I've already got fourteen complaints written down.

401
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:05,381
Most of them are small infractions, but it's the little things -- the details --

402
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:08,233
that distinguish the Barbra Streisands from the Roslyn Kinds.

403
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:09,312
Absolutely, Taylor.

404
00:22:09,436 --> 00:22:11,814
I even took it upon myself to bring my own comment cards

405
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:13,957
just in case you didn't think to supply them.

406
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,448
Well, we did supply comment cards, but I'm sure yours are even better.

407
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,295
That was a very polite response. I'm writing that down.

408
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,002
Excuse me, I need some stuff taken out of my room.

409
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:26,496
- What stuff? 
- The lamp, the bronze bookends,

410
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:30,238
the books, the shoehorns, the sewing kit. Are the paintings bolted to the walls?

411
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:34,233
Well, bring some pliers in case simple yanking doesn't do it.

412
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,655
I am not yanking the pictures off the wall.

413
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:39,768
Well, apparently, you've never been in love.

414
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:43,014
There you go, room eight. Just follow your door.

415
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:47,390
Hey, you know, this door thing is actually pretty fun.

416
00:22:47,611 --> 00:22:51,394
Michel said to fill in for him. Kirk has him taking the light bulbs out of all the sconces.

417
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:57,370
Oh, Mom, Dad! Look, Rory, there are your grandparents and everything they own.

418
00:22:57,503 --> 00:23:00,734
You didn't tell us what attire was required, so I had to pack everything.

419
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:02,878
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa. We're so glad you could come.

420
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:07,113
We're delighted to be here. May we have our key? I'm tired from the drive.

421
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:09,560
- It takes twenty minutes to get here. 
- It felt longer.

422
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,517
- Which way do we go, upstairs? 
- No, mom, you and dad aren't upstairs.

423
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:15,372
You're in our nicest room.

424
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,025
Guys, will you take my parents to room twelve? The boys will take you there.

425
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:22,483
- Where are they going? 
- Just follow them, Mom.

426
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:26,794
- They're heading outside. 
- Yes. Your room has its own entrance for privacy.

427
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:29,330
- Oh. Well, fine. We'll see you later, Rory. 
- Bye.

428
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,592
- You are the bad seed. 
- "I have the prettiest mother. Everybody thinks so."

429
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:45,222
- Hey, hi. You came. 
- Sure. I RSVP'd.

430
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,699
Here, these are for you -- a little congratulations.

431
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,834
Oh, my God, they're beautiful. Thank you. I was...

432
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:59,301
Well, okay, so, we should get you all checked in. And that's... over there.

433
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,932
- You okay? 
- Oh, God, yeah. Me? I'm totally fine.

434
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,791
- Lorelai! 
- Oh, God.

435
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:11,294
I'm fine. No problem. That was your door, so you could just follow that on up…

436
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:14,345
- and we'll see you at dinner. Rory? 
- Are you sure you're okay?

437
00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:17,600
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine It's like the third time I did that today. It's a bit.

438
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:21,732
We're going to be the comedy inn. We finally found our theme.

439
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:24,078
So, you got your key, and... bye.

440
00:24:27,954 --> 00:24:29,751
I've locked you in before, and I will do it again.

441
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:41,783
- Hey, how it going? 
- It's going very well.

442
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:43,073
Very, very well.

443
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:47,574
- Oh, Jackson, I love the shirt. 
- Isn't it great? It's an anniversary gift from Sookie.

444
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,443
- Sweet, huh? 
- These two kids.

445
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:52,961
I got to tell you, I was completely surprised. I figured, with the test run and everything,

446
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,054
- she'd be way too busy to remember. 
- What are you talking about,

447
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,432
- Sookie could never forget her mushroom man. 
- I'd love her to forget that nickname though.

448
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:01,496
- The food's great, mom. 
- Yes, it is great.

449
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:03,620
Although I admit, I know the chef, so I'm a little biased.

450
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:05,597
You're a little biased. I'm sleeping with her.

451
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:09,258
- You also grew the vegetables. 
- Oh, I did. I can't be trusted at all.

452
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:13,241
Wow Tom, I have never seen you in a suit before!

453
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,956
Really? 'Cause I'm more a suit guy than anything else.

454
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:19,477
- I'm going to make the rounds. 
- We'll be here.

455
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:24,693
- Hi, how is everything this evening? 
- Oh, my god, these robes!

456
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:27,265
What are they made of? 'Cause I am never getting dressed again.

457
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:30,034
- How are you doing? 
- I'm just staring at my plate.

458
00:25:30,092 --> 00:25:34,662
He's shy. My bathrobe slipped earlier, and his poor little heart couldn't take it.

459
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:37,659
- He's been staring at his salad ever since. 
- I like salad.

460
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:41,469
- Patty, you wanna try my fish? 
- Fish has too much mercury.

461
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,167
- For this fish, you'll eat the mercury. 
- Oh yeah?

462
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,575
- Okay, well, you two go easy on him, now. 
- We'll try.

463
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,013
- Oh! I'm sorry, Derek. 
- You okay?

464
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:52,879
There's a debate going on about that.

465
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,021
- We're all set up. 
- Stop whispering in my ear, Kirk.

466
00:25:58,107 --> 00:25:59,691
- I'm just saying… 
- You're still doing it, Kirk.

467
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:03,852
- Can I get you anything, Mr. Doose? 
- Another pen would be nice.

468
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:06,331
- Do you have enough paper? 
- Just the pen will be fine.

469
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:07,376
Coming right up.

470
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:12,449
- Hey, Taylor, how is he? 
- Who?

471
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:14,062
The kid, Derek.

472
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,008
Is he rude, slow, stupid?

473
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:20,115
No, actually, he's been an excellent waiter all evening.

474
00:26:20,943 --> 00:26:21,726
Crap.

475
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:27,609
Hey, I have no need of salad in my life ever, but this is amazing.

476
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:29,955
He's great. They're all great.

477
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:34,676
What happened to the disenfranchised youth of America? Where did all these worker bees come from?

478
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:37,266
Cheer up, Sookie, the food's going over like gangbusters.

479
00:26:38,122 --> 00:26:42,165
I went to check on the backup generators. Everything is fine.

480
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:45,930
- And the dinner's going great. 
- Everyone's settled, the doors are up.

481
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:48,401
- Everyone seems happy. 
- They do, don't they?

482
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:52,304
This is gonna work.

483
00:26:57,357 --> 00:26:59,692
- What are you doing here? 
- The place looks great.

484
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,951
Thank you. What are you doing here?

485
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,675
- We need to talk. 
- Not now we don't.

486
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:06,877
- I stayed away, I gave you space. 
- You gave me space? We broke up.

487
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:09,610
I didn't look at it that way. I looked at it as a cooling-off period.

488
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,939
How very revisionist of you. Jason, I'm working.

489
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:12,749
- Ten minutes. 
- No!

490
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,377
Lorelai, we were doing great.

491
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,529
Until you decided to sue my father, yeah, we rocked. Thank you. Goodbye.

492
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:19,420
I am not leaving.

493
00:27:19,644 --> 00:27:22,087
Jason, please, I have an inn full of people here.

494
00:27:22,661 --> 00:27:25,748
- Okay, one room, please. 
- What?

495
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,003
I would like a room. How much is a room?

496
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,604
No, no. Jason, you can't stay here.

497
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:32,097
Every room is taken. Please go. I will call you on Monday.

498
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:35,175
I can't wait until Monday. It gives you too much time to talk yourself out of trying again.

499
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,923
First I would have to talk myself into trying again, so let's make it Tuesday.

500
00:27:38,015 --> 00:27:39,753
- I'll wait till you're done. 
- I'm not going to be done for two days.

501
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:42,218
- I'll wait till you take a break. 
- I will not have a break for two days.

502
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:46,255
This is a terrible job. I would like a word with your boss. Who is above you?

503
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:47,964
Jason, I can't do this.

504
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:52,112
Lorelai, I've been sitting in my apartment for two weeks staring at a dead plant

505
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:55,383
that you gave me. Now I know we can work this out. I am not leaving until we do.

506
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:56,857
Oh, boy.

507
00:27:57,072 --> 00:28:00,114
Just go about your business, and when you're ready to talk, I will be here.

508
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:05,399
Oh, look, "Above Connecticut." I've been looking for that.

509
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:14,731
- Hey, Kirk, I'm getting tired. 
- You are?

510
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:18,444
- Would you mind if we went to bed? 
- No, that's fine. You're tired.

511
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:21,141
So, then... Let's go upstairs and go to bed!

512
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:24,893
- Okay. Good night, everyone. 
- I'm right behind you.

513
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,845
I think Kirk wants you to go upstairs and make love to him.

514
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:31,817
Will you just roll?

515
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:37,659
- Hey, how's it going here? 
- She's letting me win. It's very annoying.

516
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:39,175
How's it going with you?

517
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:43,485
Well, we locked the kitchen crew in with Michel for twenty minutes, and it backfired a little.

518
00:28:43,594 --> 00:28:46,052
Six of them quit, and we have to start hiring again tomorrow.

519
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,954
When you're done, would you run home and grab some CDs?

520
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:52,185
I totally forgot to have them in case one of the guests wants to play something in their room.

521
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:56,111
Sure, no problem. Hey, you do notice that Jason's sitting in the other room, right?

522
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:57,540
- Yeah, I'm handling it 
- Okay.

523
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:05,420
- Here. 
- What's this?

524
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:08,073
You've been sitting there all night. You must be hungry. Eat something.

525
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:09,721
Thanks.

526
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:12,476
- Here, sit and have dinner with me. 
- Oh, Jason.

527
00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:14,984
- I'll feed you. It'll be adorable. 
- How much longer are you going to stay?

528
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:18,067
Just long enough to fix everything that went wrong between us.

529
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:20,304
Luckily, I'm currently unemployed. I have plenty of time.

530
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,387
- You're very stubborn. 
- I just refuse to lose the things that are important to me.

531
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:28,086
Full house! Oh, my God, I'm kicking your ass!

532
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:31,204
- Hey, Babette, who's that? 
- Who's what?

533
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:36,694
Oh, that's Jason Stiles. He was Lorelai's boyfriend for the last six months.

534
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:37,999
- Oh, yeah? 
- Yeah.

535
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:42,106
Not exactly who I pictured her with, but he does have a very nice car.

536
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:45,208
Anyhow, they were hiding their relationship from her parents,

537
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:47,579
'cause Jason was her father's business partner.

538
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:51,590
Well, of course, the parents found out about it, and all hell broke loose.

539
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,987
- Jason wound up suing Lorelai's father. 
- They still together?

540
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,792
I don't know. I thought they broke up, but he's here, so maybe.

541
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,171
I could ask Patty for you if you want. Sometimes she gets the news first,

542
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:04,746
'cause her phone line picks up other people's conversations --

543
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:09,468
something about proximity to the power lines. I'll tell ya, location, location, location.

544
00:30:09,882 --> 00:30:12,283
- I have to get back to work. 
- Go, work. I'm fine. I'm comfortable.

545
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,872
I have food, Sookie brought me wine, and I've moved on to "Gnomes of the West."

546
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,104
I'll have someone bring you out some dessert.

547
00:30:21,908 --> 00:30:24,899
- Lorelai Gilmore, why would you do that?! 
- Do what?

548
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,505
You stuck your father and me out in that Godforsaken cabin!

549
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:28,651
It's the honeymoon suite.

550
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,487
One room, no access to the main building, pitch-black at night.

551
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:34,458
- It's romantic. 
- No television, no radio.

552
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:36,987
Actually there is a television. It's in the cabinet behind...

553
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:39,096
- And then the room service. 
- Roast beef and champagne.

554
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,246
The one chance to get out of there, away from each other, and you yank it away!

555
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,328
Why would you want to get away from each other, Mom? Are you and Dad fighting?

556
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:48,589
Stop it! You know! You know your father and I are separated,

557
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:52,643
and you brought us out here and stuck us in the woods to stare at each other for 48 hours!

558
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:55,593
What was I supposed to do? You weren't saying anything, Dad wasn't saying anything.

559
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:57,978
Of all the cruel, insensitive...

560
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,806
How was I supposed to know I was supposed to know?

561
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:01,854
- You did know! 
- But you didn't want me to know.

562
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,581
- Of course I didn't want you to know. 
- Exactly.

563
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:04,507
Exactly what?

564
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,919
You didn't want me to know, so I didn't know, and now you're mad I didn't know?

565
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:08,010
Because you did know!

566
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:10,555
But I wasn't supposed to know, so I acted like I didn't know!

567
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:14,834
And then you forced your father and me to come here tonight under pretense of family obligation.

568
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:16,523
Well, hello, that's the Gilmore way.

569
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:19,970
I won't stay out in that cabin one more second. I demand a room in here.

570
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:22,110
We don't have any rooms in here, Mom. They're all taken.

571
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:24,691
- Then bump someone. 
- Can't you and Dad just talk about it?

572
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:27,030
No, you stop it right now! This is none of your business.

573
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:31,132
- What happened? Was it Floyd's lawsuit? 
- Lorelai, just give me a room.

574
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:34,214
- I don't have a room, Mom. 
- You don't have a room for your mother?

575
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,226
I have a room for my mother. It's the room my mother's in.

576
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:37,910
That's not a room. That's a practical joke.

577
00:31:37,987 --> 00:31:41,934
No, it was a chance for you and Dad to do something special.

578
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:45,283
Fine. If you won't find me another room, then I'll just sit in there until tomorrow.

579
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,231
- Jason. 
- Emily.

580
00:31:49,805 --> 00:31:52,451
- Do you have a room? 
- No, Mom, he doesn't.

581
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:55,687
He just showed up here, because, apparently, it's Blake Edwards night at the dragonfly.

582
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:57,315
Emily.

583
00:31:58,662 --> 00:32:00,045
- Jason? 
- Richard.

584
00:32:00,346 --> 00:32:01,155
He has a room.

585
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:03,557
- Are you trying to kill us? 
- Oh, my god.

586
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:05,932
I packed our things. I think it's time to go.

587
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,577
- I hope you've had your fun. 
- Oh, yeah, it's been a blast.

588
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,018
Can I get their room?

589
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,903
- How'd you know I was here? 
- Your mom said she sent you on an errand.

590
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:28,655
Ah, you went right to the source.

591
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:31,983
- Can I...
- Sure.

592
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:32,926
Thanks.

593
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,431
I'm just trying to find some CDs for the Dragonfly.

594
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:40,605
I hear Taylor's a big hip-hop fan.

595
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:42,378
Oh, he hops with the hippest of them.

596
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:47,435
Your room looks the same.

597
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:52,561
Yeah, I tried that whole French revival thing, but it didn't really work for me.

598
00:32:54,456 --> 00:33:00,292
So... is it weird being back at home after being away for a while?

599
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,473
No, it feels completely normal.

600
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:05,606
So...

601
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:08,986
Today...

602
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:11,951
Yes, today.

603
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,285
An interesting day.

604
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,450
I'd authorize a case study if I could.

605
00:33:18,606 --> 00:33:21,508
You know, I could be wrong, but somehow I had a feeling

606
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:23,967
that maybe if Tom hadn't have come in when he did...

607
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:24,929
- Dean? 
- Yeah?

608
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:27,884
- Lindsay. 
- It's not working with Lindsay.

609
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:32,681
- I can't make it work. I've tried. 
- Are you sure?

610
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,234
Because I've heard that the first two years of marriage are the hardest.

611
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:37,126
We're not happy.

612
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,114
She's not happy, and I can't make her happy.

613
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:42,457
I can't imagine that.

614
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,519
It was a mistake, and I know that now. From the very beginning, it wasn't...

615
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:49,106
- Wasn't what? 
- It wasn't...

616
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,039
Maybe you could...

617
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:58,184
- go see a counselor or go away together. 
- No, it's just...

618
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,424
It's over. We both feel it. I know we both feel it.

619
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,701
- You and Lindsay? 
- Yeah, me and Lindsay.

620
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,784
- You both feel it's over? 
- I tried. We tried.

621
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:15,986
Well, if it's over, I'm sorry.

622
00:34:16,464 --> 00:34:17,027
You are?

623
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:19,157
I'm sorry you're not happy.

624
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:26,243
I'll be happy again. Things happen for a reason, right?

625
00:34:26,694 --> 00:34:27,364
Right.

626
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:34,707
I can't believe this is... that we're...

627
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,930
I can…

628
00:35:01,945 --> 00:35:03,696
- Hey. How you doing? 
- Good.

629
00:35:04,116 --> 00:35:06,115
- Good. Luke Danes. 
- Jason Stiles.

630
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:08,887
So, I see you had the pot roast.

631
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,104
- Good, huh? 
- Yeah, very good.

632
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,907
All the food was great tonight.

633
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:18,011
So, Jason Stiles, Jason Stiles.

634
00:35:18,094 --> 00:35:20,296
- I'll tell ya, that name is familiar. 
- I'm a friend of Lorelai's.

635
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,676
- Yeah, me too. I own the diner in town. 
- Yeah, she's mentioned you.

636
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:24,657
Has she? Well, it's nice to be mentioned.

637
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:30,756
- So... you know Lorelai from where? 
- Actually, we're dating.

638
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:33,607
- You're dating? 
- Going on six months.

639
00:35:33,694 --> 00:35:34,682
- You're dating now? 
- Yeah.

640
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:37,785
Oh sorry, my mistake. I thought you two had...

641
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:40,990
Well, we hit a rough patch, but we're working through it.

642
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:41,815
Well, good for you.

643
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:44,590
When it's right, it's right, and Lorelai and I are right.

644
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:47,206
- That's great. I'm very happy for you. 
- Thanks.

645
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:50,438
- Hey, you have any idea where the men's room is? 
- It's back through the dining room.

646
00:35:50,532 --> 00:35:52,496
- Thanks, it was nice meeting you. 
- Sure, you too.

647
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:07,665
- Hey. The last one up? 
- No, not the last one.

648
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:11,142
You okay? I heard Babette was kicking your butt at Yahtzee.

649
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,933
- Actually, I'm feeling pretty stupid right now. 
- Why?

650
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:15,474
I'm not a mysterious man, am I?

651
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,070
Well, the wardrobe's a bit of a head scratcher.

652
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,370
I think I've been very, very clear with my intentions...

653
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:21,725
You know, the wedding, the movie invite, the flowers.

654
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,683
- Luke...
- You knew what I was doing!

655
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:28,802
- Well, no, not officially. 
- Not officially? Oh, come on.

656
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:30,819
I mean, I didn't have a ref present, but other than that.

657
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,471
- Well, you didn't say anything official. 
- What was I supposed to say?

658
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:36,426
I did things. I let my actions speak. That's what you're supposed to do.

659
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:39,871
Your supposed to let your actions speak. That's the romantic way to do this, damn it.

660
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,805
- Okay, you're right. I'm sorry. 
- And you went along with all of it.

661
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:45,949
So naturally, I assumed we were on the same page,

662
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:48,749
and then your boyfriend shows up here at the inn that I invested in.

663
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:51,114
Whoa, what boyfriend? Are you talking about Jason?

664
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:54,488
- No, Tom. Yes, Jason. 
- You guys were talking? What did he say?

665
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:59,245
He said you were together. I mean, I was sitting there listening to this guy spout on and on

666
00:36:59,312 --> 00:37:02,932
about how it's right, you're right, he's right. The whole time, I'm thinking,

667
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,323
"What the hell have I been doing all this for? She's taken."

668
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:09,716
I'm not taken! We broke up!

669
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:12,245
- Well, he doesn't know that! 
- Well, just calm down!

670
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:16,491
I don't want to calm down! I did everything right! I did exactly what the book said!

671
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,651
- The book?! 
- I thought we were on track,

672
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,171
and now you're standing there looking at me like I'm crazy.

673
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:22,799
I'm not looking at you like you're crazy!

674
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:26,228
You know the last time I bought flowers for someone? Never! That's when!

675
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:28,819
- Very easy stat to remember! 
- I loved the flowers!

676
00:37:28,906 --> 00:37:31,364
And then when I walked you home after the wedding, there was a moment.

677
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:33,342
- I thought there was a moment. 
- There was!

678
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,674
There was a moment.

679
00:37:40,212 --> 00:37:41,005
What are you doing?

680
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:42,607
Will you just stand still?

681
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:54,747
What are you doing?

682
00:37:55,915 --> 00:37:57,036
Will you just stand still?

683
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,518
I'll be right back. I'll explain later.

684
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:23,087
Rory!

685
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:26,809
Oh, my God. You're missing everything.

686
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:31,822
Grab those CDs and head back to the inn before you miss the cross-dressing midgets.

687
00:38:31,928 --> 00:38:36,291
That's where the night is headed. Oh! Things are happening -- big things, wow things.

688
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,710
I have so much to tell you. Let me just open with this little tidbit --

689
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:44,540
Kirk running naked through the square.

690
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:47,525
Of course, with all my careful planning and preparation,

691
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:52,388
I forgot to bring Band-aids and a camera. I have got to learn that, always, without fail,

692
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:53,884
Kirk equals camera.

693
00:38:54,703 --> 00:38:55,685
Hey, what's going on?

694
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:57,878
Dean came over to borrow something.

695
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:04,601
- Thanks. 
- You're welcome.

696
00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:09,279
So... I should go.

697
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:12,305
Bye, Lorelai.

698
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:14,195
Bye, Dean.

699
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:21,046
So, I'm almost done getting the CDs together.

700
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:23,646
I picked a wide selection so we'd have choices,

701
00:39:23,723 --> 00:39:27,876
and then I picked a bunch that probably only you will like, but it's good to have options.

702
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,141
So, what did he borrow?

703
00:39:37,102 --> 00:39:39,294
I'm sorry I didn't talk to you about it first.

704
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:45,576
I know I promised I would, but I swear, I didn't know that this was going to happen.

705
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,543
I mean, I didn't know he was going to show up tonight, and it just happened.

706
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:53,178
It's awful for you to find out like this, I know, but everything's okay.

707
00:39:53,322 --> 00:39:55,836
I'm okay, and we were, you know, safe.

708
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:58,770
So all those Trojan man jokes all these years really apparently stuck.

709
00:39:59,553 --> 00:40:02,201
And I'm lucky, too, because Dean, he's...

710
00:40:03,388 --> 00:40:08,790
Well, aren't you glad that it happened with someone who's good and really loves me?

711
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,357
- But he's married. 
- You don't understand the situation.

712
00:40:13,521 --> 00:40:15,281
- Is he still married? 
- Yes, but...

713
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:17,039
Then I understand the situation.

714
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:19,368
It's not working out between them. They're not happy.

715
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:20,392
Oh, Rory.

716
00:40:21,447 --> 00:40:24,073
He tried the best he could, but it didn't work. It's over.

717
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:26,162
- He told you that? 
- Yes.

718
00:40:26,513 --> 00:40:28,823
- He told you he's leaving her? 
- Well...

719
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:33,628
He told you he's moving out, they're getting divorced, he's got a lawyer,

720
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,224
they've divided up the monster-truck season tickets?

721
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:40,237
- We didn't get around to discussing everything. 
- You didn't get around to discussing everything?

722
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,507
It was a crazy night.

723
00:40:41,615 --> 00:40:45,987
You, of all people -- the girl who thinks everything through, the list maker --

724
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,134
you didn't bother to discuss those things before jumping into bed with a married guy?

725
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:53,231
He's not a married guy. He's Dean -- my Dean.

726
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,248
He's not your Dean. He's Lindsay's Dean. You're the other woman.

727
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:57,748
I told you, it's over.

728
00:40:57,917 --> 00:41:00,882
It's not over until he's out of the house with the ring off.

729
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:02,299
He took the ring off.

730
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:06,995
- Oh, my God, I don't believe this. 
- He's in love with me, not Lindsay.

731
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:09,262
- Does Lindsay know that? 
- She's not good for him, okay?

732
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:12,857
She lets him quit school and work himself to death and...

733
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:17,854
No, Rory, you can't be one of those girls who blames the wife for forcing the husband to cheat.

734
00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:20,292
- He wasn't cheating. 
- He was cheating, Rory.

735
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,015
He was cheating, and you were cheating with him.

736
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,957
- There's no other way to spin that, kid. 
- I'm not spinning it, and I'm not a kid. I'm 19.

737
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:32,466
This is your first time. It's just not the way your first time was supposed to be.

738
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:34,423
Oh, and how was my first time supposed to be?

739
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,106
Well, first of all, it was supposed to be in a retirement home.

740
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:39,794
And secondly, ideally, it was supposed to be with someone single.

741
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:42,671
My first time was with someone sweet and kind who loves me.

742
00:41:42,754 --> 00:41:45,001
I didn't raise you to be like this.

743
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:48,319
I didn't raise you to be the kind of girl who sleeps with someone else's husband.

744
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:51,273
- You slept with dad when he was with Sherry. 
- He wasn't married to Sherry.

745
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:53,428
He was engaged, and she was pregnant.

746
00:41:53,525 --> 00:41:56,397
So, this is all my fault? I set one crappy example for you,

747
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,814
and you have no choice but to follow in my footsteps?

748
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:01,892
Rory, what are you going to do now? Huh? Is there a plan?

749
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:03,704
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

750
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:07,386
- I just want what's best for you, that's all! 
- I don't want to talk about it!

751
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,299
I just don't want you to get hurt, Rory. What if he doesn't leave her?

752
00:42:10,422 --> 00:42:12,265
Now you're all emotionally involved.

753
00:42:12,341 --> 00:42:14,319
You're just mad because I didn't come running to you to discuss

754
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,031
whether or not I was ready for this step. I decided it on my own.

755
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,650
Well, obviously, you weren't ready for this step.

756
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:22,060
The very fact that you chose another girl's guy to sleep with proves that!

757
00:42:22,162 --> 00:42:24,400
- He was my boyfriend first! 
- But you dumped him!

758
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:27,083
- You rejected him! You picked someone else! 
- Stop it!

759
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:29,424
- Rory! 
- I hate you for ruining this for me!
