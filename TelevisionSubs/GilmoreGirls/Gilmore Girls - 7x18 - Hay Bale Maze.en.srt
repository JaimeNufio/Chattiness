1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,500
what are you doing?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,500
when?

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
What?

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,230
Michel, michel

5
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,600
Michel, what?

6
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:09,059
You can't put your
schedules in the front of the basket.

7
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,285
It's blocking everything.

8
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:11,024
so?

9
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,400
So it shouldn't block
everything. It doesn't look good

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,542
Yes, it does. I am a man of refine and renown

11
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:20,292
. Aesthetic Fabien Baron once publicly admired

12
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:22,116
the way I decorated my locker at crunch

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,330
What?

14
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,370
I worked extremely hard on
these schedules, and it looks good.

15
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,285
Yes, the schedules look nice, okay.

16
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:32,250
Lovely font choice, lovely use of
bullet points, but give me a break

17
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,110
it's not like you made them
on an antique printing press or something.

18
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,602
Oh! I'm sorry. Did you
make your chocolate-dipped

19
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:40,780
apricots on an antique printing press?

20
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,651
Ha ha. No, of course not.

21
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:43,230
Touch�.

22
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,320
No, that's not a touch�

23
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,100
touch�

24
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,400
touch�

25
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Tou-

26
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,960
Leave it! leave it! leave it!

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
Hi, guys. How are the baskets coming?

28
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:53,590
Great.

29
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,542
Yeah, just great.

30
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:58,688
Wow. Looks like Mr. Crankypants
is in his usual spring-fling funk.

31
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,750
I'm not in a funk.

32
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,366
I wasn't talking about you,
I was talking about Mr. Crankypants.

33
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,410
Hey, the schedule looks good.

34
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,367
You should see his gym locker. Touch�.

35
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,600
Touch� yourself.

36
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,647
"Dance of the daffodils,
bingo, sack races, pie-eating... 

37
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,792
bird-watching"? We didn't
schedule any bird-watching, did we?

38
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:15,850
There was a void.

39
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:18,758
On the schedule there was
nothing scheduled on Saturday evening.

40
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:20,705
It looks ridiculous so I wrote in bird-watching.

41
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:21,706
Oh, that's clever.

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,712
Except for the fact we didn't schedule
any bird-watching.

43
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:24,313
so?

44
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:25,935
So what if people want
to do some bird-watch?

45
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:27,765
Oh, please.
No one will want to go bird-watching.

46
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,150
How do you know?

47
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,172
Who wants to watch birds?
Why on earth would you watch a bird?

48
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:34,970
Oh you know what should be on here is hay-bale maze.

49
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,151
I can't believe we're actually having a hay-bale maze.

50
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:40,214
Oh, what is wrong with people? Walking in hay?

51
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:43,665
Don't they have lives? Don't they
have televisions and elliptical machines?

52
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,655
What kind of weirdo wants to walk around in a maze of hay?

53
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:49,300
Taylor Doose and no one else.

54
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:52,500
But don't you vote on these
things in your adorable little meetings?

55
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,365
He hoodwinked us.

56
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:56,028
yeah. This year he gave
an impassioned speech about

57
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,691
how his childhood dream was
to visit a hay-bale maze.

58
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:01,450
And and he was clutching hay and crying.

59
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:03,444
It was very disconcerting but oddly moving.

60
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:05,645
So we voted yes. It was a pity vote.

61
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:06,340
And a hoodwinked vote.

62
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:09,335
And it turns out he wasn't really
crying so much as he was allergic to the hay.

63
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:10,900
Oh! Whatever.

64
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:13,123
Michel, people stopped saying
"whatever" like two years ago.

65
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:15,225
Whatever. I'm outtie 5,000.

66
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,190
subtitle by Maglori

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,930
Oh! great

68
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,930
What's the matter, babe?

69
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:17,989
Logan, did you just polish off a carton of milk?

70
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,082
Oh, yeah, I guess I did. Sorry. There's plenty more in there, though.

71
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,091
Well, actually, no.

72
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:22,910
Really?

73
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,210
Nope. There's no milk in here for my cereal. It's cool.

74
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:28,600
I'll just skip breakfast and suffer the afternoon mood swings.

75
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,272
I'm sorry I could have sworn
there were like four or five cartons in there.

76
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:32,812
Each of these milks is here for a reason.

77
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,604
I need the 2% for my cereal, whole milk for my tea,

78
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:37,903
half-and-half for my coffee,
skim milk for cooking or baking,

79
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:40,147
plus, I like to keep lactaid on hand for Doyle.

80
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:42,570
Which I don't need. Because I'm not lactose intolerant.

81
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:45,700
You're lactose resistant.
You have a bias against lactose. You're sensitive.

82
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,672
I'm not sensitive. I have no problem with lactose.

83
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:49,990
There's nothing wrong with being sensitive.

84
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:52,930
Jake Gyllenhaal is sensitive. Orlando Bloom is sensitive.

85
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,931
Me and lactose are cool. We're down.

86
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:57,925
I tell you what, I'll replenish the
2% and keep my paws off the lactaid.

87
00:03:57,926 --> 00:03:58,933
I don't need the lactaid.

88
00:03:58,934 --> 00:03:59,655
Good morning.

89
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,820
Me and lactose are bros.

90
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:01,850
Glad to hear it.

91
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:03,051
I wouldn't throw Jake Gyllenhaal out of bed.

92
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:03,900
Also good to know.

93
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:05,133
Good morning, ace. Welcome to the party.

94
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:06,618
FYI, there's no 2% milk.

95
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:07,190
Ah oh.

96
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:09,900
Guilty as charged. Man, you look great.

97
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:10,960
That is one smart-looking suit.

98
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,670
Well, let's hope that it does most of the talking because

99
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,725
I keep thinking of questions that they might ask me,

100
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:20,270
and this lovely little thing keeps
happening where my mind goes completely blank.

101
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:22,243
You know it's like "Rory, what journalists do you admire?

102
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:24,955
" ah-um "What journalists do I admire?" And nothing.

103
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,500
It's a blank. It's like a snowstorm in here.

104
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,506
It's all white and empty.

105
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:28,933
You're gonna be great.

106
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:29,650
Absolutely.

107
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:32,845
Or you'll choke. What?
It's your first big interview.

108
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:35,917
You very well may panic.
I'm just saying, don't panic if you panic.

109
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:37,566
Ah that's so sweet, Paris.

110
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:38,953
Which paper is it?

111
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:40,717
The Providence Journal Bulletin.

112
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:43,069
The pro jo -- no kidding? It's a good paper.

113
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,797
Excellent reputation. Top-notch staff.

114
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:46,279
Yeah, it could be a really good job.

115
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,292
Oh on the downside, word on the
street is they work their cubs hard.

116
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:53,377
Long hours, lots of working
lunches. And they do have a comics section.

117
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,566
What's wrong with a comic section?

118
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,562
Let's just say The New York Times
does not have a comic section.

119
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,675
Speaking of the biz,
I should hit the road here.

120
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:01,526
Where the heck is my attach� case?

121
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:02,921
You are gonna be great.

122
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:03,906
Oh, thanks.

123
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:06,487
I got a credit-card statement
addressed to you, Logan.

124
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:09,459
Addressed to you here.
No "care of..." just you.

125
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,507
Yeah that stuff used to
go to my dad's business manager.

126
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:13,215
I had them forward it here.
Hope that's okay.

127
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:14,976
That's okay. Isn't it okay?

128
00:05:14,977 --> 00:05:17,794
Yes. You're right. Of course it's okay.

129
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,718
Okay, I need to pick out a coat.

130
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,700
A trench coat would be too
"All The President's Men,"

131
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,317
but my blue coat would be
too "His Girl Friday."

132
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:26,830
I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
Why are you here?

133
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:29,205
You're not talking
metaphysically, are you?

134
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:30,247
Seriously, Huntzberger.

135
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:33,134
You're used to living in
places with doormen and Danish furniture

136
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:35,575
and refrigerators so fancy,
magnets won't stick to them.

137
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:38,350
This craphole's smaller than
the walk-in closet in your last pad.

138
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:39,210
What's the deal?

139
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:41,835
Well, my last pad was not my pad, technically.

140
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:43,213
My dad's company was picking up the rent,

141
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:44,966
and since I'm no longer working with my dad's company,

142
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,076
they weren't so keen on it.

143
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:46,843
Plus, you're broke.

144
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:47,585
I'm not broke.

145
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,270
What about this? Is it too "That Girl"?

146
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:50,520
You can never be too "That Girl."

147
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:52,813
Man, those corn flakes really did a number on me.

148
00:05:52,814 --> 00:05:54,955
Okay, I better go catch my train. Have a good day.

149
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,640
- Good luck, ace. Knock 'em dead.
- Okay I will.

150
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:57,750
- Call me after.
- Okay, bye.

151
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:01,690
Oh, after you're finished with
all your work, it'd be great if you could�

152
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:02,905
Pick up some 2%. I'm on it.

153
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:04,266
"Do the dishes," I was going to say.

154
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:05,559
Oh, okay, sure.

155
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,907
And, Logan, this probably goes without saying,

156
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,572
but no scrubby sponges on the Teflon pans.

157
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:09,595
Wouldn't dream of it.

158
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,820
Wow. What'd you do,
raid the New Mexico state library?

159
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:15,905
I know, I know I just couldn't
anticipate what I'd be in the mood for.

160
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:20,034
Would I feel like reading Melville or Mcinerney?

161
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:22,098
Or would I be in more of a Native-American,

162
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,790
interconnected short-narratives mood, in which case,

163
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,771
I'd go for the Louise Erdrich and some "love medicine."

164
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:28,417
Yeah you know what I love about you?

165
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,055
My dazzling wit and generous heart?

166
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,845
The fact that you could be in a
Native-American's interconnective short-narratives mood.

167
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:35,490
It's fascinating stuff, and you know what's funny?

168
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:38,224
Growing up in New England,
it's like you're told over and over

169
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,058
that you live in this old place where houses

170
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:42,760
are 300 years old and there's all this history, right?

171
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:43,275
Right,

172
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:46,452
Well, some of these pueblos,
like the Aztec ruins national monument,

173
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:48,012
or the Casamero Pueblo ruins --

174
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:51,044
I mean, people were living there in 1100 A.D.

175
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,445
It's like, "suck it, New England."

176
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,296
It's like what?

177
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:56,032
And actually, one of my swim-team friends lives on

178
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,697
the Jicarilla Apache reservation, which is pretty fabulous.

179
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,118
Fabulous, huh?

180
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,761
"Fabulous" is the new word in school.

181
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:05,519
I see so New Mexico doesn't
seem so terrible after all, huh?

182
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,940
Yeah, not so terrible.

183
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:11,600
You know, you look good.
Grown-up. Maybe it's the new glasses.

184
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:14,263
Thanks. A girl can only be
called Sally Jessy so many times

185
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:16,147
before she has to rethink the red frames.

186
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:18,448
Plus, I think these go better with earrings.

187
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:19,449
With...

188
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,665
Oh, look at that. You got pierced ears.

189
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,768
I basically had to.
Unadorned ears seem like a total waste

190
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:28,000
when all around where I live,

191
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:31,563
all this fabulous jewelry making
is going on. Oh, speaking of which...

192
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:34,120
- What's this?
- Open it.

193
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,794
Oh, wow, a bracelet.

194
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:42,330
Navaho tradition says that
turquoise is a piece of sky that fell to earth.

195
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:44,250
And the apache used to put little pieces of it

196
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,290
on their arrows so that they'd aim more true.

197
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,421
Well that is very sweet
of you, April. Thank you very much.

198
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:52,823
Well? Put it on. Let's see what it looks like.

199
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,020
- Fab-u-lous.
- Yeah, fabulous.

200
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,539
- Totally.
-Yeah.

201
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,403
Is that a rhetorical question?

202
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:05,103
I beg your pardon?

203
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:08,886
You said, "who doesn't love
the spring fling festival?" And I'm asking�

204
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,548
Because we just can't
imagine anyone who doesn't love it.

205
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:12,443
Michel, will you grab their keys?

206
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:15,500
Mr. And Mrs. Sinclair,
it's so wonderful to have you back. Welcome.

207
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:18,338
We've been dreaming about
the festival since the middle of January.

208
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,663
Mm-hmm. This winter was a doozy.

209
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:22,304
I got my tongue stuck to the swing set in our backyard.

210
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:23,084
Wow. Really?

211
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,858
He did. I had to get my hair dryer and

212
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,514
an extension cord and melt the poor thing free.

213
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:30,030
Well, it's just pony rides and funnel cakes from now on.

214
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,118
Let me show you all our information.

215
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:35,098
Oh, just excuse me one second.
Dragonfly inn.

216
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,020
- Hey.
- Hi, how did it go?

217
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:37,916
It went great!

218
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,317
Wow, that's great. Hold on
a second. I'll be right back.

219
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:43,008
Michel, will you talk to Rory?
Okay, so here's your map.

220
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:46,052
- Hello.
- Hey, Michel. How's it going?

221
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:48,930
Middling to poor. Where are you? I hear noise.

222
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:51,401
I'm on a train on my way back from Providence.

223
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:53,021
- Oh.
- What?

224
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:54,278
I do not care for trains.

225
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,166
Oh, no? I'm sorry.

226
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,120
Trains are dirty.

227
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,703
Well, this train doesn't look very dirty.

228
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:02,010
You know what I find particularly disgusting?

229
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,926
What?

230
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:08,110
Train tracks. They remind me
somehow of trails left behind by slugs.

231
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:10,892
You know there are a lot of slugs in the spring, you know?

232
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:13,044
Oozing all over the place.

233
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:17,875
Uh, I think your mother is
done now. It was nice talking to you.

234
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:20,333
Thank you. Have a good time.
Hey.

235
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:22,343
So it's spring fling time again, huh?

236
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,320
Oh, yeah, when a young
man's fancy turns to being totally rude.

237
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,990
So tell me about the interview. I want to hear everything.

238
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:29,213
You walked in the door. What kind of door?

239
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:30,728
You sat in a chair. What kind of chair? Go.

240
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:35,177
I met the editor, Kate Hessel, and she invited me in.

241
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:39,030
I sat down, we started talking,
and we just had so much to talk about.

242
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,975
It was great. It was an amazing interview.

243
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,603
Wow! That's great!

244
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:46,472
It was we talked about Seymour
Hersh and how he was comparing Iran to Nicaragua

245
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:48,455
and the contra war and everything,

246
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:51,548
from Alexander Haig and
Watergate to the Oprah phenomenon.

247
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,980
And the best part was I was just being myself, you know?

248
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:57,016
I was just talking, and I forgot about impressing her.

249
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,829
But there you were, impressing her.

250
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,940
Yeah and she said she'd call me by tomorrow

251
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:02,372
to let me know whether or not I got the job.

252
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:03,597
Wow, tomorrow?

253
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:05,919
Yes I feel that everything's happening so fast.

254
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,871
I can't believe school's almost over.

255
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:09,189
I can't believe it's spring already.

256
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,277
Well, it is, believe me.
We are lousy with spring flingers here

257
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,966
How are those spring flingers?

258
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:16,660
Well you know, as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as ever.

259
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:17,713
So you gonna make it this year?

260
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:19,325
Oh I do want to come, but�

261
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,523
Yay! Did I just "yay" over your "but"?

262
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:23,695
But I wanted to check with you first because

263
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:25,555
I want to make sure it's cool if I bring Logan, too.

264
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:29,259
Oh. Y-yes, of course. Gosh,
I should have thought of that. I'm sorry.

265
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,292
Oh, no, it's cool.

266
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:32,623
You can give him the grand tour of Stars Hollow,

267
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,240
and I'll show embarrassing
pictures of you picking your nose.

268
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:36,549
Oh, no. No baby pictures.

269
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,294
Who said they're baby pictures?
So, um, you're bringing a guy home.

270
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:42,225
It's not like I picked him up at a truck stop.

271
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:45,440
No, no, I know. You're
bringing a suitor, a gentleman caller,

272
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:47,375
home to stars hollow. I'm gonna have to get out

273
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:49,545
my pipe and dust off my
"what are your intentions?" Cue cards.

274
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:51,965
Next stop, mystic. Mystic, Connecticut.

275
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:52,744
Listen to you on the train.

276
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:55,286
I know. I'm in my suit. I'm reading the paper.

277
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,280
Coming back from your job interview.

278
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,865
I know I just went on an
interview for a real job in the real world.

279
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:02,426
Wow, I am impressed.

280
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,271
- Thanks, mom.
-Seriously. I'm impressed.

281
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:06,243
I'll see you tomorrow.

282
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:19,904
Okay, here we are! This is the entryway,

283
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:23,051
or the foyer, if you're feeling fancy or French.

284
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:23,715
Wow.

285
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,945
You can just leave that
stuff here. What do you mean "wow"?

286
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,856
When you walk into your parents' foyer,

287
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:31,129
there is a genuine-article Magritte
right there and a chandelier the size of

288
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,435
a Volkswagen. Now, that is a foyer with a capital "F."

289
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:36,235
Yeah but this is where Rory
Gilmore grew up -- the Rory Gilmore.

290
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:38,498
- Hello?
- Are you here?

291
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:41,555
No, we're really far away screaming really loudly.

292
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:44,457
Ha ha ha. Hi, hi! Welcome, welcome!

293
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,458
How you doing, Lorelai?

294
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:49,908
Good, good. Apparently I say
everything twice now. It's charming. Charming.

295
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,491
- Well, these are for you.
-Oh! Wow. Thank you.

296
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:53,363
Thank you for having me.

297
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,190
They're beautiful. I'll put them in a vase.

298
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:56,250
They're Cymbidium orchids.

299
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:58,014
They're native to the foothills of the Himalayas.

300
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:01,873
Well, that sounds fancy.
And they look fancy, too. Wow.

301
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:03,177
This is a beautiful house.

302
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:06,192
Thank you. I never know
what to say when somebody says that.

303
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:09,024
You don't want to agree, but on the other hand,

304
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:11,792
it feels weird to disagree
and say, "no, it's a dump," so thank you.

305
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,398
It's charming. Charming.

306
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,177
Hey, mom, we still get
cell reception in here, right?

307
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:17,878
Yeah, of course, honey. Why? Ooh, the job.

308
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,735
Yeah, she said she'd let me know by today.

309
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:22,784
Today's not over. Today's just starting.

310
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,303
Oh, honey, I'm sure
she's just busy at work, you know?

311
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:27,645
Speaking of which, I should get to work

312
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,077
because Michel's mental state is very precarious today.

313
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:31,239
Yeah, go. We'll be fine.

314
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,808
Okay I circled some stuff
in the paper for you, though.

315
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,165
So you'd have stuff to do.
There's some movies

316
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,991
if you feel like going to the movies.

317
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:41,604
And um I noticed that the
colonial butter churners are having

318
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:44,521
an exhibition at the antiquarian
society. That could be kind of funny.

319
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:46,831
And um then there will be a lot to do tomorrow

320
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,259
with the festival and everything.

321
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,649
There will be games and face-painting and stuff like that...

322
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,445
- Mom.
- What? You've lived here before?

323
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,234
Yeah I think I
remember enough to show Logan around.

324
00:12:55,235 --> 00:12:56,865
This is the town with the Sistine chapel, right?

325
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,385
Oh yeah and don't forget to show him the Pyramids,

326
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,093
Kitty-corner from the Wailing wall.

327
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:01,590
Thank you.

328
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,184
Thanks. Um so I got you guys set up in Rory's room,

329
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:06,740
and um just make yourselves at home.

330
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:08,894
I made up the bed for you and the trundle bed,

331
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:12,031
so you can do whatever you want. I mean, bed-wise.

332
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,259
Okay great, that's great.

333
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,294
So I'll see you later for dinner.

334
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,315
Unless you want to have
dinner alone, which is total cool.

335
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:18,183
Don't be ridiculous.

336
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:19,051
We want to have dinner with you.

337
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:20,691
Okay, good. Well I have the town meeting,

338
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:24,051
but I'll be home after.
I will wow you with my takeout-ordering skills.

339
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,037
She really is amazing.

340
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,680
There's talk of a show on the food network.

341
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,242
Sounds great.

342
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:29,201
And you have some guest towels there.

343
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:30,782
Oh, I didn't know we had guest towels.

344
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:33,900
Of course. "Guest towels."
A fancy way of saying "towels that are clean."

345
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:35,940
All right, I'll see you later. Have fun.

346
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,551
Okay, bye. I'll take that, then.

347
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:42,052
- Come here.
- What?

348
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:45,559
Why don't you come over here and find out?

349
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,104
What? Here? Where the Rory Gilmore used to sleep?

350
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,874
- Hi.
- Hi.

351
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:59,875
And 4 and 5. Keep those
toes pointed. Mary, that means you.

352
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:05,250
Extend and reach out. Roots push into the soil!

353
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,630
And this right here  this is the very curb
where I fell off my bicycle the second time.

354
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,018
Wait, is that blood?

355
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,722
Yeah you joke,
but it was very traumatic, okay?

356
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,087
I scraped up my whole face.

357
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,478
There was a big old scab on my
nose the first two weeks of fifth grade.

358
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,814
Oh, they called me bozo.

359
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:23,875
- Bozo.
- And Rudolph and scab nose.
- Oh.

360
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:27,845
This is the curb where I
fell off my bike the third time.

361
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:28,851
Oh, poor little scab nose.

362
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:31,140
Yes. It's also the place where I decided

363
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:33,149
I would never ride a bicycle again in my entire life,

364
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,720
or at least till the end of elementary school.

365
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:35,585
There should be a plaque.

366
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:38,025
There should be. Oh and
this is Miss Patty's dance school.

367
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:39,427
Any injuries incurred here?

368
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:40,530
Only psychological ones.

369
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:44,652
That's cute. Those are some
pretty avant-garde costumes there?

370
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:47,556
They are. They're bold.
It's for the dance of the daffodils.

371
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:50,278
There are three acts,
you see. In the first one, the bulbs dance,

372
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,875
then they grow stalks, and
then they bloom into daffodils by the third.

373
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,302
- Oh, that's cute.
- Mm-hmm.

374
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:57,862
And this hay-bale maze -- this is all Taylor's idea?

375
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:58,525
Yep.

376
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:01,443
This is the same Taylor who is
town selectman and owns two businesses.

377
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:03,369
Yeah, he's basically the Mayor of Stars Hollow

378
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,421
and Don Corleone all wrapped up into one.

379
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:07,094
- That's fascinating.
- That's fascinating?

380
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:08,635
I find Stars Hollow fascinating.

381
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:09,354
You're out of your gourd.

382
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:10,455
No, I'm very much in my gourd.

383
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:13,315
It's like colonial Williamsburg
with fewer knickers and Tricorn hats.

384
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:16,129
And more hay? This is Luke's diner.

385
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,880
Oh. When you were younger,
were you in the dance of the daffodils?

386
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:21,165
- Maybe.
- You were, weren't you?

387
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,221
Well, therein lies the psychological injury.

388
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:23,859
What happened?

389
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,574
I didn't bloom. My headpiece malfunctioned.

390
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,176
- Poor little scab nose.
- Yeah.

391
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,456
Wow, the famous Luke's.

392
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:31,980
- Rory!
- Oh, hey, Zach! You know Logan.

393
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,305
Sure, sure. How's it going, man?

394
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:34,477
Great I'm having a great time.

395
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:36,396
Hey, we just saw Kwan and Steve.

396
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:38,611
Oh, yeah? Wait, Lane was there, too, right?

397
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:40,213
- Yeah.
- She was there. She looks great.

398
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:42,500
Yeah and the babies are already growing so big.

399
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:45,129
I know, huh? Especially
Kwan. Well, at least in the torso.

400
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,000
He's got this superlong torso,
but Steve's growing in the arms and legs department.

401
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,180
I noticed he has long legs.

402
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,758
Dude, Steve's an octopus,
man, but Kwan's got the torso.

403
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,473
When it comes to torso, he's so on it.

404
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:57,590
Well, I got to get back to work. You guys sit anywhere you like.

405
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,207
Thanks, Zach.

406
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:00,977
So, is this your table?

407
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:02,849
Oh, I guess they're all kind of mine.

408
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,281
They're each my own little kitchen table.

409
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:09,182
- No call?
- No call.

410
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:12,005
- Don't worry.
- Rory, hey!

411
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:13,525
- Hey.
- Hey, Logan.

412
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:14,123
How's it going, man?

413
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:16,617
Good, good. So what brings
you to this neck of the woods?

414
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:18,308
Ah the spring fling, and it's my neck --

415
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,585
of the woods, I mean.
I wanted to show Logan around.

416
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:21,575
Well, it's good to see you.

417
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:21,813
Yeah you too.

418
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,453
You know April's here for the festival, too.

419
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:26,220
She's hanging out with her swim
buddies, but I know she'd love to see you.

420
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:26,750
Oh, great.

421
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,075
You guys know what you
want, do you need a minute?

422
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:29,365
Do you want to peruse the menu first?

423
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:30,355
- Sure.
- We'll peruse.

424
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:30,909
Peruse away.

425
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:36,040
She'll call you. Now, put it away.

426
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,059
- But...
- Put it away.

427
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,828
Hmm. You know, it's so not a big deal.

428
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:42,829
What isn't?

429
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,809
Not getting this job.
I mean It's not even my first choice.

430
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,375
What I really want is the Reston fellowship.

431
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:50,763
And not getting this job is just so not a big deal.

432
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:51,573
Okay.

433
00:16:51,574 --> 00:16:53,917
Yeah, I mean, and Providence? It's no Manhattan.

434
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:55,096
That's true, because it's Providence.

435
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,564
- Right.
- What the hell?

436
00:16:58,565 --> 00:16:59,827
Whoa.

437
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:04,514
Taylor, you cannot...
Taylor, what the hell are you doing?

438
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:05,953
Now, take it easy, Luke.

439
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:07,905
I am taking it easy, Taylor.

440
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:11,103
No, you're not. The veins
in your neck are starting to pop out at me.

441
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,726
Why is there a giant wall
of hay right in front of my diner?!

442
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,255
The entire town voted.
I'm just executing what the town wants

443
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:19,825
This is not what the town
wants. This is what you want!

444
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:22,610
-Oh, stars hollow is better than Colonial Williamsburg.
-Mm-hmm.

445
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:29,240
So they're staying in the trundle bed, huh?

446
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,241
Yep.

447
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:31,242
So if they're all cozy and trundly,

448
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:34,147
I guess that means Logan's out of the doghouse, huh?

449
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:37,128
Out of the doghouse.
Back to roaming the neighborhood.

450
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:38,927
What is that tone?

451
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:42,053
Oh, no tone. He's lovely.
I'm glad that they're doing well

452
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,975
and they're back together
and that he stopped gallivanting.

453
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:46,505
Gallivanting?

454
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:48,880
You know, gambling in Vegas, jumping off buildings,

455
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,225
whatever it was he was doing.

456
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:52,215
Of course, I don't love
that he was doing it so recently.

457
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:54,605
Sounds like Logan's still in somebody's doghouse.

458
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,869
No, no, no. Logan's a lovely young man.

459
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,895
He's nice and polite and funny.
He's got that hair, you know?

460
00:17:57,896 --> 00:18:01,580
The hair that could sell shampoo to a bald man.

461
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,202
Logan is a very charming young man.

462
00:18:04,203 --> 00:18:05,879
- I know that tone.
- What tone?

463
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,555
That. The sound of repressed judgment.

464
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:09,546
I don't know what you're talking about.

465
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,289
I am talking about last
month at the book-shop bake sale

466
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,185
when Winsen brown came up
and told us that her daughter Maude

467
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:19,582
was just signed by ford, you
know, as a baby model, and you were like,

468
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:23,221
"oh, Winsen, that's wonderful. What a great way

469
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:26,834
for a 9-month-old to see the world.
" That's the exact same tone.

470
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,229
I don't mean to be judgmental.

471
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,442
I know that's why you're talking
like you've had your jaw wired shut.

472
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:35,486
No, I just... I mean, Rory is an adult now, you know?

473
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:38,268
She's riding trains and wearing suits.

474
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:43,332
Made sense for me to have an
opinion when we were talking about Jess or Dean,

475
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:48,316
but with Logan, I don't know.
It's just really not my place anymore.

476
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:48,892
I see.

477
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,663
I mean sure, I don't love
that he just did a business deal

478
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,544
behind his father's back and lost millions of dollars.

479
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:58,595
And I don't love that after that,
he quit his job and moved in with Rory.

480
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,060
These are not things I love.

481
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,061
And I'm not crazy

482
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:07,950
in the name of getting on his
feet, he's writing in some sort of idea book,

483
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:09,190
which is, as far as I can tell,

484
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,405
is just a notebook in which he writes ideas.

485
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:10,887
Wait, what?

486
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,480
Yeah, right. I mean I have a dream journal,

487
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:14,842
but I don't use it as
evidence of my responsibility.

488
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:19,275
Look, he's an overcoiffed,
overprivileged young man, but it's not my place.

489
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:21,345
- To judge.
- Exactly.
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:23,645
Wait a minute. Where are the booths?

491
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:25,288
Where are the booths?

492
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,190
I mean, the festival's
tomorrow. All I see is hay.

493
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:30,315
A ridiculous amount of hay.

494
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:31,427
Huh!

495
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:33,710
Wow! It's crowded.

496
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:34,602
Yeah full house, huh?

497
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:35,840
- Lorelai!
- Hey.

498
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,000
Hey I'm gonna go find
Jackson. I'll save you a seat.

499
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:42,136
Okay. April, hi!
How you guys doing?

500
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,137
Oh, I'm fabulous.

501
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,658
Fabulous. So how is New Mexico treating you?

502
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,816
You had any interesting encounters with UFOs lately?

503
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,294
Oh, tons, but you know what they say -

504
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:51,766
"What happens in Roswell stays in Roswell."

505
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:52,876
Hmm. Do they say that?

506
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:54,117
Well, she does.

507
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:56,772
Wow, someone got their
ears pierced. Glamorous.

508
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:57,690
Thank you.

509
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:59,260
Someone's growing up fast, huh?

510
00:19:59,261 --> 00:19:59,696
NO kidding.

511
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:01,907
I can hear you guys, you know. I'm getting our seat.

512
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:02,806
Alright I'll be right there.

513
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:03,807
See you later, Lorelai.

514
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:07,798
Bye, hon. Oh. So...

515
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,224
So, how's the Inn?

516
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:11,436
Good. It's, uh, full of spring flingers.

517
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:12,296
Oh, I bet.

518
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:13,659
How's the diner?

519
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,780
Uh, same as ever. You know.

520
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,096
Yeah.

521
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:21,015
If everybody would please take
their seats, I'll call this meeting to order.

522
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:23,180
Well, I guess we better�

523
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:23,975
- See you later.
- Okay.

524
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:29,590
Now, I am aware that a small but vocal minority

525
00:20:29,591 --> 00:20:32,915
of you have expressed concern about the progress

526
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,613
of this year's spring fling festival.

527
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:35,654
I would like to take this time

528
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:39,118
to assure you that everything is going as planned.

529
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,488
So, how was it with Luke?

530
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:45,629
Um... polite, succinct, fine.

531
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,037
- Good.
- Yeah.

532
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,643
�well it is Babette, I assure
you there's nothing to worry about.

533
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:52,224
But what about our booths?
We don't have our booths!

534
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:56,093
Everything is under control. Take, for instance,

535
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:58,552
the hay-bale maze.
It's coming along wonderfully.

536
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:00,383
It's taking over the whole town.

537
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,832
What do you mean?

538
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,094
There's hay everywhere.
I haven't seen so much hay since...

539
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:08,426
I have never in my life seen so much hay.

540
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:11,828
Would everyone please take a handful of chill pills?

541
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:14,282
Where the hell is my damn lemonade booth?

542
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:16,972
You don't need to worry about your lemonade booth.

543
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,749
Why not? The festival is tomorrow,

544
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,432
and I have to start squeezing my lemons,

545
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:22,253
and I don't have my equipment or my booth.

546
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:23,975
You don't have to worry about that, gypsy,

547
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:29,280
because you don't need to squeeze
lemons because you don't need lemonade.

548
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:30,133
Because there isn't going
to be a lemonade booth this year.

549
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:30,575
What?!

550
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:35,258
The budget for the lemonade booth
has been reallocated to the hay-bale maze.

551
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:37,435
What about Morey's salty nuts?!

552
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:39,819
How's he supposed to have his salty nuts booth

553
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,247
if we don't have a lemonade booth?

554
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,105
If people start eating salty nuts and

555
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:45,525
they don't have easy access
to lemonade, their mouths will fall off.

556
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:47,298
Well you don't have to worry about that, Babette,

557
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:50,585
because there's not going
to be a salty nuts booth because

558
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:54,975
the budget for the salty nuts booth
has been reallocated to the hay-bale maze.

559
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:56,115
What?!

560
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:59,000
He spent the entire
budget on the hay-bale maze.

561
00:21:59,001 --> 00:21:59,852
No

562
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:03,093
I put the entire budget
into the hay-bale maze.

563
00:22:03,094 --> 00:22:03,700
No!

564
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:05,148
Taylor, you can't do that.

565
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:08,314
I have an inn full of guests
who've come here, traveled miles,

566
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:11,912
withstood winter, who blow-dried
their tongues off their swing sets

567
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,387
so they could get to the spring fling

568
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:14,198
yes

569
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,080
They expect certain
things, the traditional events --

570
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:18,871
pie-eating contests, pony rides.

571
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:21,639
They don't want just a
hay-bale maze and nothing else.

572
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,440
Feast your eyes on this bad boy.

573
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:26,800
Taylor!

574
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:31,404
That goes right up to
my diner. It's blocking my entire diner.

575
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:33,238
I don't get it. Is it a race?

576
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:38,125
You people clearly don't
understand the long and rich history of mazes.

577
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:42,422
Ladies and gentlemen of
stars hollow, perhaps this will help.

578
00:22:44,423 --> 00:22:44,800
Oh, my god.

579
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,946
What the hell is that?

580
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:48,451
I am the Minotaur!

581
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,845
The weird thing is he's been in that

582
00:22:50,846 --> 00:22:52,962
head under that velvet cloth this whole time.

583
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:56,055
Although the word "labyrinth"
is used interchangeably with "maze,"

584
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:59,990
maze scholars insist upon a distinction.

585
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:02,160
Hey, Kirk! What's with the cow's head?

586
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:04,510
Where are you people going?

587
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:09,116
A labyrinth is a universal maze,
a maze without branches, without choices...

588
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,083
You ready?

589
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:14,630
This is important. The Minotaur is speaking.

590
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:17,062
...Blind alleys down which to proceed.

591
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,366
Now, the first maze in recorded history...

592
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:25,590
People are gonna miss
your salty nuts, baby. They are.

593
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,344
- Insane.
- Insane.
- Insane

594
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,223
Hi, I'm home!

595
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,363
We're in here!

596
00:23:46,364 --> 00:23:48,762
We got a new Thai menu
that looks kind of promising.

597
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:53,539
I don't know where
Jessington way is, though� or never mind.

598
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,495
I am -- I am shocked.

599
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:58,227
I-I'm shocked to
find there's cooking going on in here.

600
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,400
It is shocking, isn't it?

601
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,473
We're making paella.

602
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:02,953
Paella? Who can even spell paella,

603
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:04,460
let alone make it? That smells good.

604
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:06,250
Can I get you wine? We have red and white.

605
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:07,483
Yeah and in paella, there's chicken,

606
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:09,030
sausage, and shrimp. So anything goes.

607
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:09,763
Uh, red, please.

608
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:10,807
How was the town meeting?

609
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:11,929
Oh yeah, how was Taylor?

610
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,126
Logan's fascinated with Taylor.

611
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:13,950
He's fascinating.

612
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:17,765
He's insane. He is ripping
out the gazebo with a crane.

613
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:18,597
What? What do you mean?

614
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:21,450
He's ripping out the gazebo with a crane.

615
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:24,348
He thinks that it defeats the purpose of the maze

616
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:26,440
if we can still see a town landmark.

617
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:28,693
Wait. I cannot believe that he is doing that.

618
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:31,333
That gazebo has been there
since Paul Revere was a baby boy.

619
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:33,340
I know. So what can I do? How can I help?

620
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:34,353
You can chop peppers.

621
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:36,855
Peppers. Those are the -- oh, right.

622
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:38,795
Hey, how do you know how to make paella?

623
00:24:38,796 --> 00:24:42,039
Well, when I was a junior at Exeter or -- no, sorry,

624
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,159
Andover -- I did a semester abroad in Spain.

625
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,375
Spain -- wow.

626
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:51,678
Oh! I think that's me.
Hello?�

627
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,242
Um so, I heard you had
a really tough business deal.

628
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:57,559
I'm sorry about that.

629
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,218
Oh, yeah, that's the way it
goes. You know these things happen.

630
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:02,328
A business is like an
ocean. You just got to surf it.

631
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:07,385
Right. Um, but Rory said
you're working on some new ideas.

632
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:08,026
How's that going?

633
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:10,405
Great. Really great. It's an exciting time.

634
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:12,067
This is the real dot-com renaissance.

635
00:25:12,068 --> 00:25:14,326
Everything's changing
from the way media is sourced to

636
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:15,650
the way we buy things to what we buy.

637
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:18,334
All the restrictions of the brick-and-mortar

638
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:19,436
retail mall are gonna be a thing of the past.

639
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:20,220
Hmm.

640
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,885
Oh, yeah, it's way
beyond Amazon and eBay now.

641
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,386
It's kind of like what's
going on with these simulation games,

642
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:27,978
like "Second Life" or "World of Warcraft."

643
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:30,388
Actual currency is
being exchanged for virtual goods.

644
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:31,061
Oh, yeah?

645
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,784
I mean theoretically, I could make a fortune

646
00:25:32,785 --> 00:25:35,790
selling virtual Lightsabers
or something on "Everquest 2"

647
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:40,490
Whatever happened to selling
encyclopedias? Not virtual enough, I guess.

648
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:42,766
Ideas are really my commodity.

649
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,210
With the experience I have
and the contacts I've gained,

650
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,155
I really feel with the right idea,

651
00:25:46,156 --> 00:25:47,425
boom, I could be right back on top.

652
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:48,266
Hmm.

653
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:51,160
Oh, my god. I got it! I got the job!

654
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:53,400
- Oh, my god, honey!
- I can't believe it!

655
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:54,220
I can.

656
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,365
I knew you were gonna get it.

657
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,414
It's a real writing job!

658
00:25:57,415 --> 00:25:58,679
A real writing job!

659
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,216
I mean I'd have a salary
and a desk and maybe even an office.

660
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:02,705
Well, not an office, but she did say something

661
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:05,186
about a desk and a salary and a 401k,

662
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:07,115
and I have to tell her
yes or no by Monday. Oh my God.

663
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:08,264
Oh, I'm so proud of you, Ace.

664
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:09,265
Oh, honey!

665
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:11,051
Someone actually wants to pay me to write

666
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,869
We need to celebrate.

667
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,876
- Absolutely.
- All right, to you.

668
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:18,571
- Cheers.
- You know what this calls for.

669
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:21,851
-  What?
- Paella.
- Yes.

670
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,923
It's a good job.

671
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:26,924
- It is.
- Absolutely.

672
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:27,865
It's a really good job.

673
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,568
I can't really imagine
living in Providence, Road island.

674
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,164
I mean I don't think there's a lot going on there.

675
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:34,350
Well, there's Brown.
It's a pretty cool college town.

676
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:36,249
Yeah which would be great if I hadn't just spent

677
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,518
the last four years
in college at a college town.

678
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,249
It is a great paper, though.
I guess that's the part to focus on.

679
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,155
It's an excellent paper.

680
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:44,902
But it's kind of small.

681
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,884
Well you could be the big fish in the small pond.

682
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:49,096
Yeah which means I would
actually get to write some articles,

683
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:50,999
which would be great. But I don't know.

684
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,822
Is it better to be a small fish in a pond where

685
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:56,344
I'm gonna learn more and
have career-advancement opportunities?

686
00:26:56,345 --> 00:26:58,045
You don't have to decide until Monday,

687
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,519
and between now and
then, you can eat a lot of pie.

688
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,998
Yes, if we ever make it to Weston's.

689
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:02,608
Seriously.

690
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:03,709
Yeah, where is this Weston's of yours?

691
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,050
Normally, it's not far away,

692
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:06,867
but all this hay's
blocking all the parking spots.

693
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:07,696
It's too much hay.

694
00:27:07,697 --> 00:27:10,117
Yeah well, we're burning off a lot of calories,

695
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:11,697
so thank goodness you ordered an extra pie.

696
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:12,845
Two extra pies, actually.

697
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:13,340
Nice!

698
00:27:14,274 --> 00:27:16,977
To be quite honest,
this is one of the best jobs

699
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:17,783
I could imagine getting.

700
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,092
That's really great.

701
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:22,432
I know, but it's just one of, you know?

702
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:27,229
It's not the best.
It's just... I don't know. I mean,

703
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,820
if I take this job,
I'm giving up the chance at the Reston fellowship.

704
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:31,821
Which you really, really want.

705
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:33,849
I'd be giving up The New York Times, you know?

706
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:38,615
But then, is it idiotic
to give up a great job for this chance

707
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,230
at another job? Not even a job.

708
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:42,546
The fellowship's only
a six-week paid internship.

709
00:27:42,547 --> 00:27:43,957
Yeah but if the fellowship is your dream,

710
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,622
I don't know I guess
people should go for their dreams.

711
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,711
Yes, honey, I want all your dreams to come true.

712
00:27:48,712 --> 00:27:51,042
You got to go for it sometimes. Screw the 401k.

713
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:54,045
Oh, well, not everyone
can live in that dream world.

714
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:55,845
It's not in a dream world, necessarily.

715
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:57,898
Yes, it is, if you're
talking about following your whims

716
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,743
and neglecting financial security.

717
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,719
I'm not saying to neglect financial security.

718
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,285
Okay.

719
00:28:02,286 --> 00:28:03,600
Not at all. When you're 22,

720
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,724
I don't think a 401k
needs to be your top priority.

721
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,583
That's all I'm saying.

722
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,550
Right, well, all I'm saying is food costs money

723
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:13,584
and rent costs money
and a salary gives you money,

724
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:14,753
so that can be a good thing.

725
00:28:14,754 --> 00:28:17,574
I agree. I'm aware of the reality of money.

726
00:28:17,575 --> 00:28:18,046
Okay

727
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:20,269
All right you guys figure out my future.

728
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,407
I'm gonna go pick up these pies.

729
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,522
Okay.

730
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:24,731
I just got my first credit-card statement.

731
00:28:24,732 --> 00:28:26,340
I'm very much aware of the reality of money.

732
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:28,888
You just got your first credit-card statement?

733
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:32,384
Earning money is great. It's just not everything.

734
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:33,465
No, I agree.

735
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:36,809
And I think in this particular
situation, Rory should take the gamble.

736
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,131
The gamble? Rory's not a gambler, you know?

737
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:42,711
She's a thoughtful, deliberate decision maker.

738
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:43,518
I know that.

739
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,789
You're a gambler, but that's not her.

740
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,050
Okay, cherry pie, banana-cream
pie, and strawberry-rhubarb pie.

741
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:50,683
Great!

742
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:53,432
I just figured, if we're gonna
do pie, we might as well do pie

743
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:55,023
- Let's do pie.
- Let's do pie.

744
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,298
What you doing awake, Ace?

745
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,002
Oh, I'm sorry.

746
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:05,337
Oh, a pro/con list.
Classic Rory Gilmore pro/con list.

747
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:06,209
There's so many factors!

748
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:06,918
Yeah.

749
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:10,041
What about all the other
newspapers that have my r�sum�, you know?

750
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,712
Taking this job means
rejecting all those other possibilities.

751
00:29:12,713 --> 00:29:14,045
I should factor that in.

752
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:14,625
Yeah.

753
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:17,962
Or what about the very real
possibility that print journalism is a dying animal?

754
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:21,007
I should factor that in
as a pro, because newspaper jobs

755
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:23,543
might become increasingly
rare, and I should snap up what I can get,

756
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:24,840
but also as a con,

757
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:25,580
because I should be careful about getting too

758
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:28,402
entrenched in what could
become an anachronistic medium

759
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:32,492
Mm-hmm. "Pro -- air quality in Providence as compared

760
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:36,441
to air quality in Manhattan.
Con -- Chinese-food quality in Providence

761
00:29:36,494 --> 00:29:38,328
as compared to Chinese-food quality in Manhattan."

762
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:39,465
You need to go to sleep.

763
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,700
Oh, no, but these are pivotal hours.

764
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:43,580
I mean these are the hours
when I'm gonna make my decision.

765
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:46,097
You need sleep, haven't you ever
heard of the expression "sleep on it"?

766
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:46,517
But�

767
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,468
We can do a pro/con list
about you doing a pro/con list,

768
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:49,649
but I say we do it in the morning.

769
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,039
I guess I am kind of tired.

770
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,847
I bet.

771
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,694
What are you doing there, babe?

772
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:01,299
Just trying to get my pants on and get some water.

773
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,039
Oh, yeah? Some water? With your pants?

774
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,530
Yeah, I don't want to go out there without pants.

775
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:08,830
You need to put a shirt on to get water?

776
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,245
Yeah what if your mom's out there?

777
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:12,212
I don't want her thinking
I'm David Hasselhoff or something.

778
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:13,413
She's not gonna think you're David Hasselhoff.

779
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:21,011
Socks? Logan, she's not
gonna think anything weird. I promise.

780
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:24,365
Socks without shoes looks ridiculous.

781
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:25,448
I'll be right back, sweetie.

782
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,214
All right, good night, David Hasselhoff.

783
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,305
- Oh.
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

784
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:43,745
I'm sorry. I didn't wake you, did I?

785
00:30:43,746 --> 00:30:46,295
No, I was... craving some pie,

786
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:48,600
but you know what? I'm not -- I'm not hungry.

787
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:49,677
I just needed some water.

788
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,916
- Lorelai?
- Yeah?

789
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,427
I want you to know I'm not a gambler.

790
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,300
Okay

791
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:02,548
Look, I know that Rory tells you stuff,

792
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:03,916
and you know all these things about me,

793
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:06,091
like I know you know
I went to Vegas and all that,

794
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:07,859
and I just I want you
to know that's not who I am.

795
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,931
I don't want you to be worried.

796
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,898
Well... I am worried.
I'm a mom. That's what we do.

797
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,086
Okay well, what exactly are you worried about?

798
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:23,065
Okay. I'm worried that
you're not worried enough.

799
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:24,377
You take things lightly.

800
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:26,373
This whole "you got to surf the waves" attitude.

801
00:31:26,374 --> 00:31:30,971
"Cowabunga, dude." I mean,
you just lost millions of dollars.

802
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,901
I know. I know I did, believe me.

803
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:35,271
And I don't feel "Cowabunga, dude" inside.

804
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:37,598
Believe me, I know I made a big mistake.

805
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,029
You do?

806
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,109
Yeah. But I don't want
to act like that in front of you.

807
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,293
I mean, for one thing,
the whole self-flagellation thing

808
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:46,540
-- it's kind of embarrassing,

809
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,311
and I just I want you to think well of me.

810
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:52,760
All right, well... it's good for me to know.

811
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:55,424
It's good for me to know
that you know you made a mistake.

812
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,087
I made a mistake.
I messed up. I really messed up.

813
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:04,547
Okay. I think 401k's are important.

814
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,452
I think responsibility and paying your bills

815
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:09,434
and dealing with reality is important.

816
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:11,910
Ah well, I'm beginning to learn about reality.

817
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:13,115
I grew up with a lot of privilege.

818
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:15,412
Right you had that whole
silver-spoon-in-the-mouth thing,

819
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:16,825
and that's not how I raised Rory.

820
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:17,400
I know that.

821
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:18,988
This was not a silver-spoon household.

822
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:20,653
This was Spork city all the way.

823
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:22,670
I get that, and I respect that because

824
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:26,136
I just spat out a whole place
setting of sterling silver royal Danish.

825
00:32:26,137 --> 00:32:27,466
I left my dad's company,

826
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,904
I left that world because I have my own values.

827
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:31,232
I understand that.

828
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:33,254
I thought you would
because that's what you did.

829
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:35,850
You left the world
of privilege to do things your way.

830
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,985
I guess I never thought of it that way.

831
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:40,320
And you did it when you were younger and

832
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:42,530
had a baby to take
care of. It was really impressive.

833
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:44,480
I don't need you to be impressed by me.

834
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:46,177
I just need you to know it wasn't easy.

835
00:32:46,178 --> 00:32:46,968
I know that.

836
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:49,217
I didn't get anything like "boom," you know?

837
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,744
I worked hard for everything I got.

838
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:55,260
I want to work. I'm ready
to work. And I want to work hard.

839
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:00,215
- All right, then.
-All right, then.

840
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:11,475
Since we're up, do you
think we should have some pie?

841
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:13,676
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah.

842
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:15,375
You think we should have
some vanilla ice cream on it?

843
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:17,535
That's my favorite. I love vanilla ice cream.

844
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,770
Are there any people chasing you?

845
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:40,043
No, it's just a maze -- a maze made out of hay.

846
00:33:40,444 --> 00:33:43,205
And there's no people jumping
out at you with, like, squirt guns?

847
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:45,962
I don't think so sweetie it's just
a maze, but it's made out of hay!

848
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:48,477
So, wait a minute.
There's no lights or fireworks?

849
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:51,807
It's really just a maze
made out of hay? What a drag.

850
00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:53,465
You're preaching to the choir

851
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:55,925
Well, I can't believe
we're finally here at the maze.

852
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:57,820
It's all I've dreamed since I could dream.

853
00:33:57,821 --> 00:34:00,454
Oh man there is just
something about being in a maze of hay.

854
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,553
Totally.

855
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:04,265
Oh man, am I glad I got
out of that waterslide park

856
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:05,992
so I could come to the hay-bale maze!

857
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:06,962
Take it down, Olivier.

858
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:08,083
Not buying the waterslide thing?

859
00:34:08,084 --> 00:34:10,195
Well, just keep it real. Well,

860
00:34:10,196 --> 00:34:13,020
the hay-bale maze is gonna
be really fun, and then afterwards,

861
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:15,482
Sookie has prepared hot dogs and funnel cakes

862
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:17,133
and salty nuts -- all the festival classics.

863
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:18,760
You like hay-bale mazes?

864
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:20,150
Oh, yeah, I'm crazy about them.

865
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:22,238
- That's cool.
- Co o on, let's go!

866
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,706
- Hey, thanks.
- No problem.

867
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,725
Wow, look at that. You think maybe Taylor was right?

868
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:30,490
Bite your tongue.

869
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:31,479
That man is a genius.

870
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,285
- Whoa!
- Hi, guys.

871
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:35,884
That was, "whoa!" Right, babe?

872
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:37,266
- Whoa.
- Oh, you okay?

873
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:39,769
The maze. Just high on the maze.

874
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,417
Let's go, people. Keep
it moving. Damn allergies.

875
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:51,566
All right, next 10 can go.
Uh, no gum, no matches, no pushing, no shoving.

876
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:53,765
No running in the maze!

877
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:56,749
Oh, and if you get lost
in the maze, don't panic,

878
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,195
just stand still, wave your hands,

879
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:01,314
and the, uh, maze guard will find you.

880
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:02,755
Oh I'm gonna say hi to Sookie and Jackson.

881
00:35:02,756 --> 00:35:06,052
I'll be right back. Hey, kids.

882
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:08,010
Hi, you guys. Did the kids like the maze?

883
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:09,194
The kids loved the maze

884
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:10,200
We loved the maze.

885
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:12,785
- Really?
- Yeah, it's really fun.

886
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:14,930
But it has no fireworks, no lights,

887
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:16,575
no guys with squirt guns. Why is it so fun?

888
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:17,597
It's just cool!

889
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,118
You know when you were
making that pro/con list the last night?

890
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,815
Yeah?

891
00:35:21,816 --> 00:35:24,152
I kind of noticed there
was something on there about me.

892
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:27,130
Oh. Yeah. I didn't know where to put you.

893
00:35:27,131 --> 00:35:28,952
Yeah, I was that, I saw you wrote "Logan,"

894
00:35:28,953 --> 00:35:30,331
and then there were like three question marks.

895
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:32,622
Well, there were just so many factors.

896
00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:34,798
And I wasn't sure to
what extent I should factor you in.

897
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,611
Well, I want you to know
I don't want you to factor me in.

898
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:47,330
No. I mean... I'm not sure
exactly what I'm gonna be doing next,

899
00:34:45,331 --> 00:35:49,701
and I know I want to start putting my ideas out,

900
00:35:49,702 --> 00:35:50,900
and I know I want to start working,

901
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:52,336
but I think you should do what you want to do,

902
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:55,627
and then -- and then maybe I'll factor you in.

903
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,565
Oh. You want to factor me in.

904
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:01,090
Yeah. I'd like that. If you're in providence,

905
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:01,995
maybe I'll come live in providence.

906
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:04,036
That would be great.

907
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,349
But just, in general,
I'd like to factor you in, too.

908
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,185
Okay. But for this one, you make your decision

909
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:13,698
based on what you want
for you. You do what you want.

910
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,593
Okay. You know what I really want?

911
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:21,175
What's that?

912
00:36:21,176 --> 00:36:28,031
I want to go for the fellowship.
I'm gonna say no to the pro jo.

913
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,708
Okay.

914
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,922
Yeah, I'm gonna go for it. Okay.

915
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:38,485
Okay, next group! No gum,
no matches, no pushing, no shoving.

916
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:42,805
If you get lost in the maze,
wave to the man on stilts. You're good to go.

917
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:43,940
Mom, you want to come with us?

918
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:45,185
Uh, no, go ahead.

919
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,140
You got the tuna there?

920
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,538
Tuna on rye, tuna on wheat,
mayo, no mayo respectively.

921
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:14,976
Yeah. No. No, delivery
time hasn't changed. Yeah. No, no, no,

922
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:17,069
the maze hasn't changed anything. Okay, all right.

923
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,951
Uh, French dip, ham and Swiss,

924
00:37:18,952 --> 00:37:22,445
fries, fries, onion rings,
roast beef, BLT, BLT no "B,".

925
00:37:22,446 --> 00:37:28,953
BLT no "T," turkey on rye,
burger. Yep. No. No problem

926
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,222
- Okay.
- "Okay" what?

927
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:31,550
Okay I've got something to tell you.

928
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:32,667
I don't have time for dramatic pauses Zach.

929
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,922
I've mastered the maze. I have. At first,

930
00:37:34,923 --> 00:37:36,667
I thought I had to go
around the maze to make the deliveries,

931
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:38,580
but, dude, it's easier to go through the maze.

932
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:38,911
Great, Zach

933
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:41,528
I know. At first, I wrote
it down, you know the path,

934
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:44,276
but I don't need it
because it's all up here, or in here.

935
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:46,720
Check it out, eyes closed -- it goes left,

936
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:51,600
right, right, left, left,
left, right. Wait. Left, left, right�

937
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:52,855
Don't give it away.

938
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:55,090
I am dying to go through
the maze. I bet it's fabulous.

939
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:56,902
- It so is.
- Go.
- Go?

940
00:37:56,903 --> 00:37:57,770
GO through the maze.

941
00:37:57,771 --> 00:37:59,230
Don't you need help here?

942
00:37:59,231 --> 00:37:59,795
Bye, dad..

943
00:37:59,796 --> 00:38:00,622
Have a fabulous time.

944
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:02,091
I got a patty-melt burger well-done,

945
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:04,795
Pastrami on rye, chili dog,
and three orders of fries.

946
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:07,265
I'm good to go, man. You know what I'm gonna do?

947
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:08,157
I can't begin to imagine.

948
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:09,695
I'm gonna go through the maze at night,

949
00:38:09,696 --> 00:38:12,400
all alone, me, a
blindfold. You know how I can do it?

950
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:13,115
How's that?

951
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:13,788
I can smell the hay.

952
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:14,712
We can all smell the hay.

953
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,669
No, dude. I can smell the hay.

954
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:01,350
Oh, god! Hey.

955
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:03,450
- Hey.
- "Hey." Hay.

956
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:04,930
Oh, you got snacks

957
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:06,429
Yeah, well, Zach forgot these.

958
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,205
The hay's kind of gone to his head.
Anyway he gave me these directions here.

959
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:10,864
So I just go right, left�what?

960
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,115
What is that?

961
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,668
Oh! April gave it to me.

962
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:15,087
You have a bracelet on your wrist.

963
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:17,986
She's into jewelry.
It's just a phase. What could I do?

964
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:19,179
Uh, wow!

965
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,397
It's just one of these crazy phases.

966
00:39:21,398 --> 00:39:23,440
I was just getting
used to the fact I had a daughter.

967
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:24,738
Now all of a sudden, I have a teenager.

968
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,346
It's wild. Time just goes by.

969
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:27,676
- Luke.
- Yeah.

970
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:30,408
I'm sorry.

971
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,850
Yeah, I'm, uh -- I'm sorry, too.

972
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:35,851
No, no, let me go first.

973
00:39:35,852 --> 00:39:36,654
Okay.

974
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:43,083
I messed up. That night
I went to Christopher -- I'm sorry

975
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:46,049
Yeah.

976
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,489
I mean I never admitted it to
you that it was wrong what I did,

977
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,790
and it was, and I'm really sorry.

978
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,653
Okay. Thanks.

979
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:56,199
I don't know why I didn't say this before.

980
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:03,443
Ah. You know... I'm sorry,
too, 'cause... I don't know,

981
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:09,695
it's just... now that
I've had April, it's... I've learned a lot,

982
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:12,770
and I was crazy to
think that I had to fix everything

983
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:15,237
in my relationship with
April before I could really be with you.

984
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:17,310
And that's just not how you fix things.

985
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:21,166
I mean things just don't
stand still. They're always changing.

986
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:21,818
Yeah.

987
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,866
I guess I was compartmentalizing?

988
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:25,965
If that's what you call it.

989
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:28,002
I mean I should
have opened my compartments.

990
00:40:28,003 --> 00:40:29,350
I should have gotten your help.

991
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,626
I wanted to help.

992
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:35,036
I know. And I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry, also,

993
00:40:35,037 --> 00:40:38,230
because I think I used April
to pushed you away.

994
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:39,542
You did, huh?

995
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:43,871
Yeah, I think so. I was
afraid, and... I'm so sorry.

996
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:47,118
It's really okay.

997
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,320
- I'm glad.
- Me too.

998
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:56,047
Well, I got some fries that are getting cold.

999
00:40:56,048 --> 00:40:57,778
Oh, yeah, well, I got to find my way out of here.

1000
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:01,686
By the way, you're really close.
Just go left, two rights, and you're out.

1001
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:03,075
Thanks.
