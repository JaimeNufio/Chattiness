1
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:12,734
Hi... Let's get us a little breakfast.

2
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:15,104
Come on. Come, Paul Anka.

3
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:35,701
Breakfast! Get it while it's room-temperature
and nutrient-free!

4
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:39,701
Milk, cream, and sugar's on the table.
Flo's got coffee. Who needs a jolt?

5
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:40,502
I do.

6
00:00:40,588 --> 00:00:45,296
Okay. Inspect the bagels closely, because the
expiration date was in braille, apparently,

7
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,846
and either they're new or
from my baby shower.

8
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:52,903
I'm also sorry to report that we are
currently out of the brown
sugar cinnamon pop-tarts.

9
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,894
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

10
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:55,961
Don't "ohh!" me. You guys have been
playing favorites all week.

11
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:59,187
And now it's time to pay the piper,
so someone be a man.

12
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:01,548
Suck it up and start eating
the shredded wheat.

13
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:04,212
Cowards. Oh, hey, ooh!

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,416
Remember, people,
only pet the dog with your nonwatch hand.

15
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:12,338
In case you don't remember,
watches cause him to freak out,
jump up on the counter,

16
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,382
and kick my once-working
toaster across the room.

17
00:01:15,547 --> 00:01:16,291
Your muffins.

18
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,241
My what?

19
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:19,337
You left an urgent message
about needing muffins.

20
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:21,338
Oh, right. Muffins, boys!

21
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:22,349
These were for them?

22
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:25,892
Oh no, they were for me.
I thought I'd eat my weight in muffins today.

23
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:27,857
Does the dog have to sit
in the chair like that?

24
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:29,397
Like what? His posture's perfect.

25
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:30,399
Chairs are for people.

26
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:31,872
Not that chair. That's Paul Anka's chair.

27
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:33,978
Dogs are filthy.
They have fleas and malaria on them.

28
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:36,717
You shouldn't have fleas and malaria in
the room that you're gonna eat in.

29
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,196
I don't eat in here. They do.

30
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:41,656
Enjoying your free breakfast there, fellas?
Nice free coffee there, Craig.

31
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:42,945
Nice free muffin there, Benny.

32
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:44,726
Gee, Luke, I don't think they
know what you're getting at.

33
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,911
Okay, that's good. Are you done here?
'Cause Tom wants to talk to us.

34
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:53,964
Alright, Norman, I'm gonna need you to find
me some cripple studs for that
bearing wall we're putting in,

35
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:57,930
'cause once that sucker's vertical,
we got to be ready to nail in those joists.

36
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:03,355
Just keep doing what you're doing and
then bring those tools up to check.

37
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:07,518
So, Steve, later today we're gonna
need to dig a footing drain

38
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:10,697
all around the perimeter, about 5 feet deep.

39
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,013
That ought to keep the basement dry.

40
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,278
This house doesn't have a basement.

41
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:17,520
No, it certainly does not.

42
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:21,976
Okay, this is ridiculous.
How long are you gonna let T.J.
think that he's the contractor?

43
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,186
To the very end, my friend.

44
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,199
This is stupid.
We have to tell him the truth.

45
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,896
No, look how happy he is strutting around
in his toolbelt and shiny silver helmet.

46
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:31,281
You know he polishes that thing
every night after work.

47
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:31,888
Really?

48
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:34,090
Yes, really, with real silver polish.

49
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:37,981
That's what he thinks silver polish is
for-- to polish anything that's silver.

50
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:39,208
I think that's adorable.

51
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,595
And the good news is he's
got terrible instincts,

52
00:02:41,658 --> 00:02:45,975
but he combines that with zero
follow-through, so it
all works out in the end.

53
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:50,359
Terrible instincts, zero follow-through-- all
the qualities you want
in a good pretend contractor.

54
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:55,379
But we're paying T.J. a contractor's salary
to do a job that he's not actually doing,

55
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:58,684
and you're paying Tom an extra 10%
to pretend he's not doing a job

56
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:01,580
that T.J.
thinks he's doing but Tom is actually doing.

57
00:03:01,637 --> 00:03:04,090
You should hire Blake Edwards
as your contractor.

58
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:06,632
Oh, no. T.J.'s playing with the circular saw.

59
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,223
Tom will get to him before
he finds the on switch.

60
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,805
We're going to tell him.

61
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,936
Luke, he is your brother-in-law.

62
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:14,610
Just because Liz married him.

63
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:19,939
which will make you happy,
which will make me happy.

64
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:22,926
Well, just so you know,
I'm gonna oversee this entire thing.

65
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:25,281
I'm gonna make sure T.J.
doesn't blow the house up.

66
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,653
I appreciate that.

67
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,317
Will you please go make the guys an
extra pot of coffee? I'm gonna go
to Babette's and take a shower.

68
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:31,750
Why? Your shower's working.

69
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:34,557
Ah, well, yeah.
Just had a little incident in here yesterday.

70
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:35,688
What kind of incident?

71
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:38,640
Nothing big. Some of the guys saw me naked.

72
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,086
- What?
- It's no big thing.

73
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:42,171
How in the hell did a couple
of guys see you naked?

74
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:45,487
- I was getting out of the shower, and Joe--
- Joe? Joe saw you naked?

75
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:46,488
- And Pete.
- Pete.

76
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,672
Pete was with Joe, and then Slim--
- Slim saw you naked?

77
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:52,397
Well, I could see him,
so I assume he could see me.

78
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:56,503
Billy had the best view-- just a straight
shot right down main street.

79
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:57,952
So four guys saw you naked?

80
00:03:58,013 --> 00:03:59,558
If you don't count Teddy, then yes.

81
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:01,657
What in the hell were those guys doing
up there in the first place?

82
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:03,438
T.J. accidentally sent them up.

83
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:04,610
I'm gonna kill him.

84
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,524
Luke, it was no big deal. Please.

85
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:07,729
We all laughed about it.

86
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:10,688
From now on, I'm showering at Babette's,
so show's over.

87
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,636
No one sees the goods but you, okay?

88
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:17,689
They're good.

89
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,090
They're stale.

90
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:21,401
And the blueberries aren't blue. They're red.

91
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,300
My god, these blueberries are red!

92
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,491
They're raspberries.

93
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:26,961
Well the box said they were blueberry.
It was printed on the side.

94
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:29,769
- Actually, I was in the kitchen,
and the box said-- - She just kills me,
that woman.

95
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,428
It wasn't as provocative
as you think, grandma.

96
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,474
"On my last visit to the office, I noticed
the foliage on the right side of the entrance

97
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,730
looked a little peaked.
We might want to let the gardener know.
Ta, ladies."

98
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,492
Again. It's not exactly Martin Luther
nailing the 95 theses to a door.

99
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:49,317
It's implying I have no control
over my hirelings at the D.A.R.

100
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:50,528
I'm the president.

101
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:55,521
The foliage on the right side of the door,
which looks fine, by the way,
is my responsibility.

102
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:58,080
This is a direct frontal assault
on my leadership.

103
00:05:58,142 --> 00:05:59,400
The woman's plotting a coup.

104
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:00,744
This is Constance, right?

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,972
Constance Betterton.

106
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:04,015
Ever since the Mastersons' Christmas party,

107
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,433
when I mentioned that Constance's husband
sells used cars for a living,

108
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:09,969
which he does-- he calls them "pre-owned,"

109
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,360
but they're used-- she's had it in for me.

110
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,455
She's gonna run against me
in the next election.

111
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:18,496
You don't try to oust a president of the
D.A.R. after one term-- it's an insult!

112
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:20,133
I think you will beat her handily.

113
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,039
Did I tell you she tried to push
me down the stairs once?

114
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,777
Look, grandma, don't worry.

115
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:25,698
You have someone on the inside now.

116
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:26,890
I do? Who?

117
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:27,781
Me.

118
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:29,069
Oh.

119
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:30,569
Yes.

120
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:32,921
I'll keep an eye on Constance from now on--

121
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:35,957
let you know when she comes in,
when she uses the computer,

122
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:38,117
when she's inspecting the landscaping.

123
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:39,815
Well, that's wonderful!

124
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,098
But stay out of the stairwell.

125
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:42,068
Will do.

126
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:45,790
Mmm. Raspberry.

127
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:47,207
I like raspberry.

128
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:51,304
Twist ties?

129
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:52,706
Twist ties are over there.

130
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:56,016
Is that bag half full or half empty, Jules?

131
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,717
Oh, you're making me an optimist, my friend.

132
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:00,692
- Rory?
- Liza?

133
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:01,560
Rory?

134
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:03,588
No, we agreed.
Not until the end of your shift.

135
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:05,858
But I don't think the patch works on me.

136
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,920
That is a billion milligrams of nicotine.

137
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:08,861
Is that bad?

138
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:12,468
Just go sit by the cooler, have some water,
and take those off.

139
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,093
Problem?

140
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:18,245
No, I just told her to get some water.
She seems really dehydrated.

141
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:19,163
Looks pretty good.

142
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,041
Yeah.
I think we've hit a really good rhythm here.

143
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:24,703
I've paired up Rinaldi and Spiro,
which worked out very efficiently.

144
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:26,924
Sanderson got a little grumpy
toward the end of the day,

145
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,549
but it's 'cause he wants to be noticed,
and he is by far our best spearman.

146
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:34,070
Also, we need to remember to pack a couple
of extra trash spears tomorrow.

147
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:37,486
The McFarland brothers are using the
trash pickup to get out some
of that pent-up aggression,

148
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:39,799
which is psychologically healthy
but hard on the equipment.

149
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:40,888
Got it. So, what's it looking like?

150
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:44,202
Well, our quota's up. The kids are tired.
I think it's time to call it a day.

151
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,524
All right, everybody, let's bring it in!

152
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:49,568
Hey! A bunch of girls are going for pizza,
if you want to come.

153
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:50,233
I'll come.

154
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:51,386
Are you a girl?

155
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,572
No.

156
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:57,044
I would, but I can't.
I've got a 3-hour shift at the nursing home.

157
00:07:57,095 --> 00:08:00,494
I can't believe how much community
service they stuck you with.
What the hell did you do?

158
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:02,222
I shot a man in Reno.

159
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,088
Give it.

160
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,044
The truth is,
this is the first time in my life

161
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:15,345
that I've consistently spent
the night with a man.

162
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:16,988
I don't know the rules.

163
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:19,949
I mean, obviously, the clothes have to come
off for the actual sex part of the evening,

164
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,977
but, afterward, what are you supposed to do?

165
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:25,533
I mean, nightgowns are obviously out,
but wearing nothing seems extreme

166
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:27,198
and, in case of fire, completely impractical.

167
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:28,769
- Oh, sure.
- I wore a camisole one night.

168
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,273
It almost strangled me.

169
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:32,777
And I'm definitely not a teddy girl,
so what does that leave?

170
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,990
Um... t-shirts.

171
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,801
But what does a t-shirt say about me?

172
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,078
- Well...
- More importantly.

173
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,682
What does it say to Doyle about me?

174
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:41,110
Sweetie, it's just a t-shirt.
They don't tend to be that chatty.

175
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,125
I don't know. Maybe I should reconsider
the "completely naked" option.

176
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:45,746
After all, I'm 21.

177
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:47,256
If not now, when?

178
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:50,412
I mean, right now, my ass is probably
as good as it's ever going to get.

179
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:51,782
I should exploit that, right?

180
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:54,401
Absolutely. Buy a video camera, go to town.

181
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:55,863
You know what, I'm starting to fade here.

182
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,112
Oh, me too.
Listen, it's been a terrific lunch.

183
00:08:58,118 --> 00:08:59,098
I'll get another espresso.

184
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,367
Actually, we're out of espresso.

185
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:01,542
- You are?
- Yes.

186
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:05,283
We shut the machine down at
3:00 to give it a rest.

187
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:08,209
'Cause it's Italian,
so it's a little temperamental.

188
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:11,445
Oh. Okay. Well, then, I guess I should--

189
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:13,893
Go? Really? Okay. Well, hmm.

190
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:16,285
Sweetie, it's been a blast again.

191
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:17,820
Okay. So, I guess I'll see you Tuesday.

192
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,155
Yeah, Tuesday. Perfect. Can't wait.

193
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,197
Okay.

194
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,542
Is she gone?

195
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,507
- Yes, she's gone.
- Thank God.

196
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:30,408
I can't believe you're in here
hiding from a little girl.

197
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:31,393
Oh, yes, you can.

198
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,183
She has a tough exterior, but in the inside,
Paris is...

199
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:35,186
Tokyo Rose.

200
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:37,826
She's lonely.
She does not have a lot of friends.

201
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:39,184
No! Shocker!

202
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:40,048
Sookie.

203
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,584
No. No "Sookie."

204
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,758
She's horrible.

205
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:46,294
I mean, she sends everything back twice,
and she makes the waiters write down

206
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:48,692
exactly what she wants me to
know is wrong with the food.

207
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,075
At least you're hidden in here.

208
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,472
I'm out there behind a desk,
exposed to all of her elements.

209
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,160
Michel.

210
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,412
She mocked my accent.

211
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,634
She called me "Canadian."

212
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,298
It's enough already.
I won't cook for her anymore.

213
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:00,201
Lunches.

214
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:01,532
Twice a week for three weeks?

215
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:05,962
Yeah, creepy. The next thing you know,
you'll be carrying Emmanuel
Lewis around on your shoulders.

216
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:08,436
We don't have time for this, Lorelai.
We have a wedding this week.

217
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:11,121
I've got a menu to plan and a cake to design.

218
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,273
I don't have time to map out the fish
patterns for my wild salmon.

219
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:16,623
Okay, okay,
I'm sorry she's bothering you guys.

220
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,047
What can I do?
I gave her my cellphone number.

221
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:21,645
I told her to call.
I just didn't think she'd use it so often.

222
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,727
Well, cut it off.

223
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,934
I feel sorry for her.

224
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:25,262
No one likes to be pitied.

225
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,236
Fine, I have to cut it off. I know. I will.

226
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:28,559
Do you promise?

227
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,335
I promise.

228
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:31,573
Good, because I've got a lot of work to do.

229
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,223
We've got a ton of planning to do for this
wedding next week, and the menu's a mess.

230
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:38,185
And the cake.
I was thinking about a red velvet cake,
but I don't know.

231
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:41,665
I'm using this wedding as a trial run,
so it has to be perfect.

232
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:42,696
A trial run for what?

233
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:44,001
For your wedding.

234
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:45,926
- Oh.
- Which will be when?

235
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:46,644
What?

236
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:47,471
When?

237
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:48,108
When what?

238
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:50,294
When will you be getting married?
I'm gonna need a date.

239
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:52,143
Oh, we haven't set one yet.

240
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:55,454
Well I had Michel black out
all of July for next year.

241
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:56,126
You what?

242
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,513
I figured you and Luke for a summer wedding.

243
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,268
Who and Luke?

244
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:01,527
July 23rd is my pick, but I am flexible.

245
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,015
Michel, unblack it out.

246
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:04,077
I told you.

247
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,012
"I told you" what?

248
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:07,004
I told her that you were not getting married.

249
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:08,148
I am getting married.

250
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:09,175
You were right. You called her.

251
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:11,506
The woman can't commit to a purse,
much less a man.

252
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:12,481
I am getting married.

253
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:14,761
I am so naive. I believed.

254
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:15,854
Live and learn.

255
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,135
Hey, I am getting married. I am.

256
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:20,880
We will set a date.
And we will get married on that date.

257
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:23,775
And I've had the same purse for almost
a year, thank you very much.

258
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,834
Of course. My mistake.

259
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:28,545
Now let me go cancel your wedding plans.

260
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:31,231
Those are not my wedding plans.
They are Sookie's wedding plans.

261
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,610
Well, fine, then!
What are your wedding plans?

262
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,095
They haven't been formalized yet.

263
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:35,921
What does that mean?

264
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:39,627
Sookie, come on.
I got men running around my house,
a completely destroyed bedroom--

265
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,136
things are crazy right now.

266
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:44,396
When they calm down and Luke and
I get a chance to breathe,

267
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,054
we will talk and set the date.

268
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:48,057
Until then, will you drop it, please?

269
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:49,018
Fine. It's dropped.

270
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,003
She's back! She's coming back!

271
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:51,821
- No!
- Why?!

272
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:55,109
I don't know why.
Maybe she left her phone or her spell book.

273
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:58,345
All I know is she's heading back toward the
Inn, and I'm not going out until she leaves.

274
00:11:58,355 --> 00:12:01,450
Michel, you're being ridiculous.
You're a grown man. And you have a job to do.

275
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:03,932
So do you. And I don't see you rushing out.

276
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:06,694
Well I can't.
'Cause I'm not done with my coffee yet.

277
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:08,013
Mmm!

278
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:10,316
Good to the last drop.

279
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:16,033
Daughters of the American Revolution.

280
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:20,064
Mrs. Tarkington, yes,
I've got your application right here--

281
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:21,737
Sandra Tarkington.

282
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:25,633
Um, I guess we just need to make 100% sure

283
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,925
that you're related to a verifiable
patriot, because we couldn't
substantiate it on our end.

284
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,364
Well, see, that's the thing--

285
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,556
the fact that you found a musket
in your great-uncle's attic

286
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:38,442
doesn't necessarily mean you're related
to a revolutionary war patriot.

287
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:39,592
Yeah.

288
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:44,792
Unfortunately, even if your great-uncle
Nate swore on your aunt
Kissy's grave that it was so.

289
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:48,427
It's documented genealogy,
preferably notarized.

290
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:50,387
Could you hold on for a moment?

291
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:53,456
Psst. Where's Julia?

292
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,209
Slinked to the back after I tore
down Constance's letter.

293
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,877
Good, 'cause I've got some gossip.

294
00:12:57,953 --> 00:13:00,347
My own little Valerie Plame. What's the news?

295
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:03,910
Okay.
So, I was at lunch with some of the girls,
and I started sniffing around,

296
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:07,672
just casually asking if anyone had
funny stories about Constance.

297
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:09,017
You sly fox!

298
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:12,113
So one of the girls tells me
that about three months ago,

299
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:13,749
she was in the office with Constance,

300
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,727
and as Constance was heading out for lunch,

301
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:19,156
she stumbled and dropped her purse,
and her altoids box popped open,

302
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:21,907
spilling out enough funny-looking
pills to fill a pharmacy.

303
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,254
Constance claimed they were all vitamins.

304
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,578
Julia didn't buy it.

305
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:29,598
Because the minute the pills spilled
out, Constance threw herself
on top of them to cover them up.

306
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:32,267
A cover-up-- that's good.
That's what took Nixon down.

307
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:34,647
This is so exciting! I love having a mole.

308
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,743
We should go buy you a trench
coat and fedora.

309
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:39,880
I suggested to the girls that next week
we invite Constance to lunch--

310
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:41,938
get a couple drinks in her
and see what comes up.

311
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:45,168
Who knew that behind such a sweet
face lurked the soul of a spy?

312
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:47,980
I prefer the term "woman of
mystery and intrigue."

313
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:49,156
Excuse me.

314
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:51,160
Hello?

315
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:51,965
Rory.

316
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:53,227
Oh, hey, Paris.

317
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:54,494
Hey, we need to talk.

318
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:55,805
This is a bad time. Okay.

319
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:57,621
No, now's a fine time. What's up?

320
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:59,604
Good.
This hard-to-reach thing was getting old.

321
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:00,911
I'm all yours, Paris.

322
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:04,300
I have to put down a security deposit
today by 5:00 or we lose the place.

323
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:04,925
What place?

324
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:06,209
- Our place.
- Our place where?

325
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,612
Our off-campus place.

326
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:09,300
You're hard to reach in a myriad of ways.

327
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:11,984
Paris, we don't have a place.
I'm not moving off campus with you.

328
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:12,591
Why?

329
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,336
Because I no longer go to campus.

330
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:16,749
So you're sticking with this "not
going to Yale" thing of yours?

331
00:14:16,796 --> 00:14:17,699
Yes, I am.

332
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:18,914
Is this about the boat?

333
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,469
How do you know about the boat?

334
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:21,990
Oh, come on. It's out there.

335
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:24,546
Out there? Why is it out there?
How is it out there?

336
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:26,364
I read about it on Rebecca Thurston's blog.

337
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:27,913
- You're kidding.
- I'm dead serious.

338
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,307
I thought Rebecca Thurston's blog was
just about the guys she has sex with

339
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:32,556
and how much she hates her mother.

340
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:35,613
That's true,
but the boat you guys stole belongs to
Dr. Daniel Zimmerman,

341
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:38,555
whose son is Jason Zimmerman,
who Rebecca Thurston had sex with

342
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:41,264
on her father's boat last semester.

343
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:42,857
I can't believe I'm in the blogosphere.

344
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:46,040
See for yourself.
Just Google "Rory Gilmore sex boat."

345
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:47,047
Oh, my god.

346
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,661
Is it true you and Logan tried to outrace
the Connecticut coast guard?

347
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:50,943
Rent the apartment, Paris.

348
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,355
I'm not coming back to Yale.

349
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,141
You know,
you've put me in a very difficult position.

350
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:57,223
Now what if I end up renting the room
to a rapist or serial killer?

351
00:14:57,267 --> 00:15:00,424
I told you over two months ago
that I was not coming back.

352
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:04,634
And besides, I think Yale is pretty
good about screening for
rapists and serial killers.

353
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:06,985
There was no sense of finality
in our last conversation.

354
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,280
There was a total sense of finality.

355
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,924
You can believe that if you want to,

356
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:15,158
but if I end up on the front page
of the Hartford courier btk'd
to death, you'll know why.

357
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:16,385
Goodbye, Paris.

358
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,412
Hello?

359
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:33,290
I will find you, no matter how long,
no matter how far!

360
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,280
I will find you!

361
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:36,498
What the hell's going on here?

362
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,402
Hey, Luke.

363
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:40,204
Hi. I'm just doing my Daniel Day-Lewis
retrospective for the guys.

364
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:42,278
You should see her rendition
of "my left foot."

365
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:43,459
Yeah, I've seen it. Thanks.

366
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,269
No, this time, I did it with my right foot.

367
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,416
Totally different. I'll show you.
Pete, hand me the paintbrush.

368
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:48,777
That's okay. I'm good.

369
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:52,068
You know, there's a bunch of open paint
cans sitting out on the porch.

370
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:54,265
Yeah, they'll get to it.
We just didn't want the pizza to get cold.

371
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,503
Hey, check out this new trick
we just taught Paul Anka.

372
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,131
Hey, Paul Anka, pizza!

373
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:00,106
Pizza, pizza!

374
00:16:01,123 --> 00:16:02,185
Salad.

375
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,924
Good boy. Good boy.

376
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,346
Oh, shoot, I'm out of treats.

377
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:09,556
Be right back.

378
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:13,432
You know those guys are here to work.
You don't have to put a USO show on.

379
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:14,732
I know. I just want them to have a good time.

380
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:17,196
Half of them have seen you naked.
How much better a time can they have?

381
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:18,987
He's jealous of my popularity time.

382
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:19,817
Sure. I get that.

383
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:22,814
Tom, do other clients feed their construction
crews breakfast and lunch

384
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:25,020
and buy them pizza and beer?

385
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:27,823
Nope. Of course,
the naked thing's been done to death.

386
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,650
All right, Tom, we're outie.
Anything you need to discuss before we go?

387
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,720
No, we talked about everything
but the kitchen.

388
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,484
What about the kitchen?

389
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:34,993
Well, do we want to make it bigger?

390
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,379
Why would we want to make it bigger?

391
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:40,229
You might want a nice double
oven or a sub-zero freezer.

392
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:43,069
There's room enough for an island
and a cooking station

393
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,461
with some stools around it for entertaining.

394
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,600
You know, for dinner parties.

395
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,204
Or maybe you want to cook
a big holiday dinner--

396
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:51,560
Thanksgiving or Christmas.

397
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:52,833
The strange man is scaring me.

398
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,742
I think the kitchen's fine, Tom.

399
00:16:55,107 --> 00:16:59,680
Okay, everybody can relax because your
trusty contractor has returned.

400
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:03,736
Boy, what a trip. Traffic was terrible.
It took me an entire day.

401
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:05,286
Here you go, Tom--

402
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:07,007
the mystic hammer.

403
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,966
Thank you, T.J.

404
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:10,785
I got to tell you,
I don't see what's so special about it.

405
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:13,843
It looks an awful lot like every other
hammer we got lying around here.

406
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:16,749
Well, that's the beauty of
the mystic hammer, T.J.--

407
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:19,368
It looks the same,
but it's completely different.

408
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,825
Tom, make sure those cans are
cleaned up out there, okay?

409
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:22,949
Oh, my god.
Enough with the paint cans, already.

410
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:23,951
I almost tripped over the cans.

411
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:25,554
Don't worry, Luke. I'll take care of it.

412
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:28,591
Hey, did you guys know there
was a room back here?

413
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:32,073
Oh, yeah, look at this-- a whole room!
What a find, huh?

414
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:36,174
Boy, if you knocked out this wall here,
opened up this room,

415
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:37,766
you would have a huge kitchen.

416
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:39,840
Yeah, we don't want a huge kitchen, T.J.

417
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:43,310
You could turn it into a weightroom
or a workshop--

418
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,448
or, hey, a pork-smoker room.
My uncle had a pork-smoker room--

419
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,070
big sides of pork hanging all over the place.

420
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:51,802
We called it the dead-pig room.

421
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:54,342
T.J., why don't you go out there and
tell the guys that they can go home.

422
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:56,010
It's not that big a job.

423
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:57,909
I could have it up and running
for you in a week.

424
00:17:57,971 --> 00:18:02,178
All I got to do is drive over to Boston
for one of those special sledgehammers

425
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:05,840
Tom was telling me about, get a pig,
and in about 10 minutes--

426
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:07,289
Just leave the room alone, okay?

427
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:10,573
Just-- it's fine. Leave it alone. Let's go.

428
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,657
Is she Jewish or something?

429
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:20,183
# I have to interrupt and
stop this conversation #

430
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,270
# You boys have crossed the line... #

431
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:26,287
# I like to talk when I can
show you my affection #

432
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,388
# Oh, I can't control myself #

433
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:32,448
# Oh, I can't control myself #

434
00:18:32,993 --> 00:18:35,790
# Oh, I can't control myself #

435
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,476
# Talking on the telephone #

436
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:43,147
# Thank god that wasn't me #

437
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,260
# Oh #

438
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,036
# Thank god that wasn't me #

439
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:47,398
# Oh #

440
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,446
# Thank god that wasn't me #

441
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,289
Whoo!

442
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,805
Massachusetts, we love you!

443
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,083
We love you, man!

444
00:19:02,134 --> 00:19:05,904
We'd like to give some shout-outs before we
go-- first and foremost, to Pastor Tim.

445
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:08,106
Yeah! Pastor Tim!

446
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:14,830
Thanks for letting us rock the gym here at
Whitfield seventh day Adventist church.

447
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:18,562
Got into some very heavy talk
with the Pastor about my soul

448
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:21,730
and Ecclesiastes and stuff after sound check,

449
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:26,051
and I got to say, if Christ comes
back in fulfillment of prophecy,

450
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:30,728
he's gonna be hooking up with you first,
dude, 'cause you are awesome.

451
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:36,745
We would like to also thank the decoration
committee for making
the A.V. room look so cool.

452
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:42,980
I've played the whiskey before, man,
and it's got a similar vibe. It does.

453
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:46,540
But most important, we'd like to thank
all of you for coming out to see us,

454
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:49,840
and letting us into your homes,
and making us feel welcome.

455
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:52,397
We got to go!

456
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:55,190
We are going home, people!

457
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:57,931
There are some t-shirts and stuff
for sale on the table over there.

458
00:19:58,024 --> 00:20:00,367
We are Zach, Gil, Brian, and Lane,

459
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:03,758
and we are Hep Alien, and we are out of here!

460
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,631
We were so on, man.

461
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:12,700
We were beyond on. We were-- ohh!

462
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:14,579
Cool.

463
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,658
Watch it, Lane. The pastor's still hanging.

464
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:18,470
We were as tight as the foo fighters.

465
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:19,270
Tighter.

466
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:24,142
Listen, if that pretentious snot in Coldplay
can walk around comparing himself to Bono,

467
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:26,402
we can compare ourselves to the Foo Fighters.

468
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:29,897
I'm exhausted but exhilarated.
I'm not gonna sleep for months.

469
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:31,762
Oh, cool. There's people buying t-shirts.

470
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,818
We can get some food tonight.

471
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:34,281
Just leave money for gas.

472
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:36,238
We'll have money for gas, guys. Don't worry.

473
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:39,496
Let's just drink this in-- the
last night of our first tour.

474
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,151
I can't believe it's over.

475
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:42,856
I can't believe we survived.

476
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:46,288
You got it, Pastor Tim.

477
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,595
We got to break it down, guys.

478
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:52,494
They want to start setting up for bible
study tomorrow, and they need
the stage for their big crucifix.

479
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:58,790
Okay, here we go. Aah!

480
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:01,700
What is that? And where can I get one?

481
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:04,666
That is my dark chocolate
s'mores wedding cake.

482
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:05,930
You've been reading my diary.

483
00:21:05,986 --> 00:21:07,253
I got the idea in a dream.

484
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:10,858
I was back in cooking school and late for
my final, and I run over to an oven,

485
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:13,521
and I open it, and sitting there
is the s'mores wedding cake.

486
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,617
And I present it to my teacher,
he starts weeping,

487
00:21:15,683 --> 00:21:18,013
and the whole class is applauding
and cheering.

488
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,076
That's so nice.

489
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:22,902
Yeah. And then of course Katie Holmes and
Tom Cruise come leaping out of the cake,

490
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,108
screaming about how amazing it is.

491
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:27,901
So that made the thing a little creepy,
but up until then...

492
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:30,893
You've got a marshmallow bride
and groom on the top!

493
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:32,208
- You think they'll like it?
- I do.

494
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:33,543
Think you'll like it?

495
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:34,997
Look, captain Ahab--

496
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:37,049
- Come on, set the date.
- I will.

497
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:38,502
Is there something you're not telling me?

498
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:42,958
Because agreeing to marry somebody is just as
big a commitment as actually marrying them,

499
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:43,812
so don't think it's not.

500
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,283
I am committed, and you should be.

501
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,749
Si this isn't a joking matter, missy.

502
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:51,233
I want your wedding to be perfect
or I want nothing to do with it.

503
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:53,271
Oh really? Wow, that might be a problem.

504
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:57,746
'Cause I was hoping for one of those
disastrous weddings where we lose both rings

505
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,114
minutes before the ceremony and I get a
nosebleed as I'm walking down the aisle.

506
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,091
Then later, at the reception,
Luke is found in the coat-check room

507
00:22:04,153 --> 00:22:06,213
Jude Law-ing it with one of the bridesmaids.

508
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:09,821
I just received a call that the wedding party
will not be getting in until midnight,

509
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:12,428
and someone will need to
be here to greet them.

510
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,421
I would do it, but I don't want to.

511
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:15,282
All right, I'll do it.

512
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:16,827
Very well. I'll leave the--

513
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:19,543
Wait. Do you feel that?

514
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:20,257
Feel what?

515
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:23,929
An icy chill as if something
sinister is approaching.

516
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:24,662
What?

517
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,154
Gee, Michel, is Paris here?

518
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,222
Maybe she was coming up the walk when I fled.

519
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:31,963
Where are you going?

520
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:34,220
In the opposite direction.

521
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:35,918
Paris? Paris is here?

522
00:22:35,997 --> 00:22:38,151
Oh! I get the humming now!

523
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:40,560
What is she doing here?

524
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:41,735
We're having lunch.

525
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:43,168
Really? Ordering pizza?

526
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:45,649
No Sookie, I'm breaking up with her today,
all right?

527
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:48,686
I'm ending it, like I promised, so back off.

528
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,582
Grilled chicken and fries-- that
is all I'm making.

529
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:52,732
Thank you.

530
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:58,984
Apparently, the eagle has landed.

531
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,542
Paris, hi. Good to see you.

532
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:05,252
You look good. Something different?

533
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:07,998
I accidentally sprayed gasoline on
myself at the service station.

534
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,006
That must be it. Come on. Let's sit.

535
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:12,322
Sorry I'm late, I was interviewing roommates.

536
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:16,115
All I can say is build an ark,
'cause it is seriously time for a flood.

537
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:18,107
Oh, well, you want some iced tea?

538
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:22,428
I mean, forget the concept of intelligence or
even the act of carrying on a conversation.

539
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:24,529
These people can't type a reference sheet.

540
00:23:24,626 --> 00:23:28,050
They all have questionable morals,
a complete distrust of soap products--

541
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:29,241
in the glass, out of the glass.

542
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:31,383
It's all semantics to you, right?

543
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:34,898
Oh well, I'm sure you'll find someone.
Just keep looking.

544
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:38,460
I guess. Classes start next week,
and things are already getting crazy.

545
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,221
Yeah. Boy.

546
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:41,916
You sound really busy, Paris.

547
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:42,791
I am.

548
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:47,060
You know, I feel a little bad, dragging
you all the way out here when
you have so much on your plate.

549
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:49,200
I mean, talk about self-centered, huh?

550
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,305
Think about someone else
for a change, Lorelai.

551
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:52,516
Oh, that's okay.

552
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:56,506
You know, I'll be totally fine if you
need to cut back on our lunches.

553
00:23:56,556 --> 00:23:57,162
Cut back?

554
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:59,537
Cut back, cut out-- whatever y need.
It's fine with me

555
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,061
You know, This all sucks.

556
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:03,579
I wouldn't be in this position
if it weren't for Rory.

557
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:05,652
She was supposed to room with me.
It was all planned out.

558
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:09,411
I called her yesterday and gave her one
more chance to change her mind, but no.

559
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:10,633
You talked to Rory yesterday?

560
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,461
I called her at the office.

561
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:14,035
Office? What office?

562
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:14,884
Her office.

563
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,674
She has an office? What is she doing?

564
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:17,885
I don't know-- her job.

565
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:18,696
What job?

566
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,044
Some job in an office with her grandmother.

567
00:24:21,197 --> 00:24:22,948
Her grandmother does not have an office.

568
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,035
Well, that's where I called her.

569
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,176
This makes no sense to me at all.
What did it sound like?

570
00:24:26,228 --> 00:24:26,880
An office.

571
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:29,544
Yes, I know, an office.
Were there specific office sounds?

572
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,822
I think I heard a fax machine.

573
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,819
A fax machine?
Are you sure it was a fax machine?

574
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,615
Pretty sure.

575
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:35,905
Were there people talking or traffic?
Did you hear traffic?

576
00:24:35,946 --> 00:24:39,560
'Cause that could give us a location-- the
city, the county or... what?

577
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:41,542
So that's what this is all about.

578
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:44,379
- You're just using me to get to Rory.
- Oh Paris.

579
00:24:44,397 --> 00:24:47,481
You're pumping me full of espresso
and pumping me for information.

580
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:50,047
No, that is not true. I'm not pumping.
No pumping.

581
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:51,792
We're completely pump-free.

582
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,484
I'm so stupid. I mean, why else would you
want to have biweekly lunches with me?

583
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,721
There are many, many reasons.

584
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:00,503
They will come to me just in a second.

585
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:01,371
I'm blind.

586
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,019
I walk blindly through life.

587
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,811
No. Now, you're not blind.

588
00:25:04,874 --> 00:25:06,289
I'll leave. I'll go right now.

589
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:07,717
Oh, Paris, please. I'm sorry.

590
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,766
You mentioned Rory,
and a thing went off in my brain.

591
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:14,231
It's just a mother thing.
But I love our lunches. I really do.
Please stay.

592
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:15,291
Are you sure? Because I-

593
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:17,913
Yes, I'm completely positive.

594
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,580
Everything's good.

595
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,269
Now, won't you sit down?

596
00:25:22,968 --> 00:25:24,923
How does chicken sound-- okay?

597
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:26,145
Okay.

598
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:27,465
Just not too dry.

599
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:28,918
Okay.

600
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,521
The service here sucks.

601
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:46,619
Very smooth, Mr. Hollister.

602
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,546
That was the Susy-q right
into the shorty George.

603
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:51,069
I thought it looked familiar.

604
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:53,491
After this song, I'll take you for a twirl.

605
00:25:53,545 --> 00:25:55,284
Oh, I hope I can keep up.

606
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:58,579
Watch those hands, Mr. Fink.

607
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:01,316
I'm on it.

608
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:04,965
You know, I can get this for you guys on CD.

609
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:09,251
Oh, now, come on. It wasn't that funny.

610
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:10,895
Oh, my god.

611
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:12,030
Hey, stranger!

612
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:13,359
And hello to you.

613
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,089
Watch those hands, miss Gilmore.

614
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,681
Touché, Mr. Fink.

615
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:18,615
What are you doing here?

616
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:22,111
I was in Copenhagen this morning,
and I remembered I have a mambo class.

617
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:24,097
I'm so glad you're back. How was Europe?

618
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:25,366
Same as it was last year.

619
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:26,433
What did you do?

620
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:28,702
Long, embarrassing story.
I'll tell you later.

621
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:30,885
Okay. Oh, wait. Hold on.

622
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:36,095
Okay, everyone,
it is time for cake and punch.

623
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:40,031
It's a 15-minute break,
and then it's back to the dance floor.

624
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:41,234
You're Arthur Murray now?

625
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:43,113
No, I don't have that much training.

626
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,349
Their dance teacher has an ear infection.
I'm just filling in.

627
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:48,380
My job is to make sure nobody falls down.

628
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:49,960
And what if somebody does?

629
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:52,009
That's what the panic button is for.

630
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,888
So, when does this crazy
rock 'n' roll party wrap up?

631
00:26:55,904 --> 00:26:57,394
Another 45 minutes,

632
00:26:57,446 --> 00:27:00,510
but if you get yourself some cake and punch,
it'll only seem like 40.

633
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:04,074
I missed you.

634
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,198
That was my plan.

635
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:10,993
Thank you.

636
00:27:11,065 --> 00:27:12,245
You're welcome.

637
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:16,331
I missed this.

638
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,379
Me too.

639
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:21,173
So you, Colin, and Finn didn't do
a lot of cuddling in Europe?

640
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:23,171
Nah, mostly just hand-holding.

641
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:27,939
So is there any official record of
this trip, or was all evidence
confiscated at the airport?

642
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:28,975
I got pictures.

643
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:30,361
Yeah? Can I see?

644
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:31,533
Hand me that.

645
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:37,268
Now, you realize if I show you mine,
you have to show me yours.

646
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:39,541
You saw mine five minutes ago, mister.

647
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:41,639
Oh, I hate it when you work blue.

648
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:42,704
Okay.

649
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:45,489
Here's Colin sleeping on the train.

650
00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:51,055
And here's Finn shoving carrot sticks up
Colin's nose as Colin sleeps on the train.

651
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:52,138
Very mature.

652
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,057
We try.

653
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:55,208
This is Gloucestershire, England,

654
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:59,085
where we attended the famous Gloucestershire
cheese-rolling festival,

655
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:02,215
a time-honored tradition where
brave men such as myself

656
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:04,402
climb to the top of a hill with
a large wheel of cheese,

657
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,456
then push it and run after it
as it rolls all the way down.

658
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:08,422
Shut up.

659
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:10,541
Why would you commit that to film?

660
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:13,821
That's me, that's Colin, that's Finn,
and that is the cheese.

661
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:18,329
So if you beat your cheese to the
bottom of the hill, are you
disqualified, or do you win?

662
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:21,430
There are no winners or losers in the
Gloucestershire cheese-rolling festival.

663
00:28:21,497 --> 00:28:23,387
There certainly aren't any winners.

664
00:28:23,524 --> 00:28:24,700
Tell me about it.

665
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:26,184
Who's that?

666
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:27,863
Oh, that's the love of Colin's life.

667
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:29,315
Colin fell in love?

668
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:30,772
Yeah, he met her in Holland.

669
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,274
She doesn't speak a word of English, so
she has no idea how incredibly
annoying she finds him.

670
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:35,732
What's with the outfit?

671
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:36,877
She's a milkmaid.

672
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:39,069
- Stop.
- She has cows. She has pails.

673
00:28:39,141 --> 00:28:40,804
Colin fell in love with a milkmaid?

674
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:42,092
It's pretty serious, too.

675
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:45,409
He ditched us and followed her to Amsterdam,
where they've been holed up ever since.

676
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,667
We haven't heard a word from him.

677
00:28:46,728 --> 00:28:48,638
We assume he's gonna be back by the time--

678
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:52,145
By the time what?

679
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:55,998
By the time the cows come home? What?

680
00:28:57,011 --> 00:28:59,419
By the time school starts?

681
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:02,986
What?

682
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:04,167
What's the matter?

683
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:05,219
Nothing.

684
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,086
Logan, you can mention school to me.

685
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,499
I don't want to bum you out.

686
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,255
Logan, that is ridiculous.

687
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:12,715
I'm fine.

688
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:14,890
I mean, look--

689
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:19,392
Yale was a wonderful chapter in my life,
but I've moved on.

690
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,386
I have my work. I have my new pad.

691
00:29:21,456 --> 00:29:23,854
I'm just really happy with
where I am right now.

692
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:24,855
Really?

693
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:27,499
Logan, you don't have to
feel weird about this.

694
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:31,106
You go to Yale. Your friends go to Yale.
How can we not talk about Yale?

695
00:29:31,194 --> 00:29:32,668
- I don't know.
- Exactly.

696
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,851
So we both agree that the topic of
Yale can never be off-limits.

697
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:40,860
Okay, fine. If you're so cool with it,
then why don't you meet me at Yale tomorrow

698
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:43,280
and I can show you my new apartment
and maybe take you to lunch?

699
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,579
I can't tomorrow, because I have my D.A.R.
induction luncheon.

700
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:48,126
Well, then, how about breakfast?

701
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,326
Breakfast sounds good.

702
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:53,905
I have to say, ace, I like the new digs.

703
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:55,901
Yeah, it's really nice, huh?

704
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,909
You haven't even seen the bedroom yet.

705
00:29:58,465 --> 00:29:59,715
Wow.

706
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:00,621
What?

707
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:03,622
Okay, fine, but don't think that this
is gonna work a second time.

708
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,795
Oh, no, Logan, I didn't mean--

709
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:09,471
No, I seriously meant that you
hadn't seen the bedroom yet.

710
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:10,959
You're making me feel cheap, ace.

711
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:12,052
Logan!

712
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,587
I swear, I wasn't working blue.

713
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,139
Come on, let's go!

714
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:18,689
Martha's thirsty, guys.

715
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,796
- I hate that he named the van.
- I think it's cute.

716
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:22,893
Hey, you're not pumping premium, right?

717
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,439
It's the cheap stuff, bro, don't worry.

718
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:26,790
Yeah, you said that before,
and you pumped premium,

719
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:28,562
and it meant no snack stop in Philadelphia.

720
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:30,050
Whoa ho ho!

721
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:31,123
What, Gil?

722
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,103
I was watching the numbers spin by on the gas
pump dial thingy getting bigger and bigger,

723
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,337
and I was thinking-- what if that
was counting all the people
on the world who were,

724
00:30:39,392 --> 00:30:42,904
like, dying, you know,
so it's all these dead dudes spinning by?

725
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,523
Every day with him is like
being on "meet the press."

726
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:46,832
I can't feel my legs.

727
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:48,156
Move around a little.

728
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:49,327
Your amp's on my foot.

729
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:51,097
Look, I'm no better off than you are, Brian.

730
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:52,925
My guitar case is jammed against my thigh.

731
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:54,977
I got a cymbal stand sticking in my pancreas.

732
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,402
Guys, we are an hour out of Stars Hollow.
Hang in there.

733
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,609
God, the smell of that gas
is making me hungry.

734
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:02,340
- Gil, hurry!
- I'm coming.

735
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:06,026
All right.

736
00:31:06,986 --> 00:31:10,903
It's the last of the gas money,
so this better get us home.

737
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,681
Everybody, lean forward.

738
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,408
Gil, where'd you put the map?

739
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:21,118
It's-- ugh.

740
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:22,454
You're okay to drive, right?

741
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:24,188
Yeah, sure. I'm just--

742
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:28,494
Dude, don't do that thing where you don't
finish your sentences. It freaks me out.

743
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:31,246
I'll try. I'm just-- ugh.

744
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:31,961
Come on.

745
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:33,792
I guess I'm just weak from hunger.

746
00:31:33,855 --> 00:31:35,377
The guy I got gas from--

747
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,532
I was talking to him, and he suddenly
turned into a giant turkey leg.

748
00:31:38,582 --> 00:31:39,825
Please don't mention food.

749
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:42,802
Let's think good thoughts, guys.
Picture yourself at home, okay?

750
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,533
Home at last.
What's the first thing you're gonna do?

751
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,518
Eat.

752
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:47,105
Wash my hair,

753
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:49,952
hug the kids, set them up in front
of a "Harry Potter" movie,

754
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:52,561
and then do my wife for, like, an hour.

755
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:56,273
Uh, look, guys, I've got an announcement

756
00:31:56,355 --> 00:32:00,564
kind of in my capacity as band manager,
and I think it's gonna cheer you up-- a lot.

757
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:01,596
What?

758
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:05,169
Well, as you know,
each gig paid us a little something,

759
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,351
and we stayed free at people's
houses along the way,

760
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:11,597
and we sold a decent amount of t-shirts, so,
besides food,

761
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:16,032
which we consumed in moderation, there were
days that we spent practically nothing.

762
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:16,956
Yeah?

763
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:21,062
Well, I wanted us to come out
of this tour with something,

764
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,453
so I figured the best way to motivate
us to save would be to fib
a little on how much we had.

765
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:27,571
You fibbed a little?

766
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:30,411
Actually, a lot, but it paid off big, guys,

767
00:32:30,446 --> 00:32:33,653
because we're going home with over $9,000.

768
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,448
Huh? $9,000-- American dollars.

769
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:40,226
Why aren't you guys jumping up and down?

770
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:43,645
Besides the fact that my spinal cord
severed somewhere on the 95?

771
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:46,909
And that we haven't eaten a full
meal in over two months?

772
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:48,444
I thought we were broke.

773
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:49,942
See? See how it worked?

774
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:51,710
And now we're reaping the rewards.

775
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:53,978
Lane, we were starving.

776
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:55,544
We scrimped on everything.

777
00:32:55,636 --> 00:32:58,126
I stopped brushing my teeth because
I couldn't buy toothpaste.

778
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,662
I've been washing my hair with bar soap.

779
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:02,833
But think about what we
can do with the money.

780
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:04,287
We can record--

781
00:33:04,656 --> 00:33:06,550
make a CD.

782
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:08,937
Nirvana made "Bleach" for $600.

783
00:33:08,983 --> 00:33:12,310
Even factoring in inflation,
if we're on our game,

784
00:33:12,376 --> 00:33:13,994
we could make "Bleach" 10 times over.

785
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:15,143
Our own "Bleach."

786
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,550
It would be very cool to record.

787
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:17,468
Very cool.

788
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:18,543
I think...

789
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:21,822
Dude, come on.
You got to finish that sentence.

790
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,357
I can't talk and drive.

791
00:33:23,444 --> 00:33:24,742
Then just drive, Gil.

792
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,037
30 miles--

793
00:33:26,196 --> 00:33:28,025
30 miles to home.

794
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,297
Are you talking about how pretty I am again?
Get a new subject, boys.

795
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,236
What are you doing home?

796
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,770
Well, I have to be at the Inn late,
so I thought I'd come and feed Paul Anka,

797
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:40,431
take him for a little walk,
work out our crosswalk issues.

798
00:33:40,493 --> 00:33:42,485
- Well, Tom here--
- It's not my fault.

799
00:33:42,547 --> 00:33:43,833
I wasn't gonna say it was your fault.

800
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,150
You've got "it's Tom's fault"
tone in your voice.

801
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:48,753
He's got to shut your water
off for a couple of days.

802
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,539
We hit a pipe that shouldn't been hit.

803
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,263
Tom!

804
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,477
See how the "it's Tom's
fault" tone has spread?

805
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,376
You can stay with me.

806
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:58,208
Okay, I got to get back to work.
That wedding party's coming in tonight.

807
00:33:58,276 --> 00:33:59,507
I'll gather up some of your stuff.

808
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,116
The last time you gathered up some of my
stuff, you accidentally brought
me four bras and no pants.

809
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:04,323
That could have been intentional.

810
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,012
I will get my own stuff, thank you.

811
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:10,273
Now I have to figure out what
to do with Paul Anka.

812
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:13,111
You know,
I've never left him alone so late before,

813
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:16,242
and he might start doing that howling
thing the neighbors are so fond of,

814
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:18,455
but-- well, that's okay.

815
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:22,121
So... you know,
I guess I could just leave him here

816
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,810
and I can come back and get him after work,
which will be 3:00, 4:00 in the morning.

817
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,044
Boy. Late.

818
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:31,673
Or I could drop him off at
a kennel for a few hours.

819
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,635
There's a good one in Woodbridge,
20 miles away.

820
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:38,969
Of course, I'd have to leave now and pick
up some dilithium crystals on the way

821
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:42,777
to fix the warp drive in my jeep so
that I could drive there and back

822
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:46,089
in time to meet the wedding party back
at the Inn, but that's doable.

823
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,975
Yeah... and then, of course, by
the time I get off work and
drive all the way back there,

824
00:34:51,032 --> 00:34:53,568
the kennel will be closed,
so I'd have to break in,

825
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,612
and that would set off some security system,
and then I'd be arrested.

826
00:34:56,663 --> 00:35:00,000
So I should probably put a nailfile
on my shoe. And how much longer
are you gonna make me do this?

827
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:01,812
I just wanted to see how long you'd go on.

828
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:03,851
Well you know my babbling capabilities
are infinite.

829
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:07,438
I'll take the dog home with me. And points
for the dilithium-crystal reference.

830
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:09,101
Well, when you sleep with geeks...

831
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:11,043
Hey.

832
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:15,159
I just talked to my buddy Tony Benzino,
who's a contractor over in Hartford.

833
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:18,886
And he says contractors don't
fetch lunches for the crew.

834
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:21,468
They do, however, get to answer the phone,

835
00:35:21,545 --> 00:35:24,163
and they do get to sign for
things and order things.

836
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:28,723
And Tom,
there is no such thing as a mystic hammer.

837
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:32,073
And after this very enlightening
conversation,

838
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:33,767
you know what I'm starting to think?

839
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:34,611
What?

840
00:35:34,703 --> 00:35:39,262
I'm starting to think that I'm not
really the contractor on this job.

841
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:40,564
Look, T.J.--

842
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:42,249
It's okay, Luke. I got this.

843
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,299
T.J., we did this for your own good.

844
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,986
We got you out of the house. You got paid.

845
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,184
You didn't get hurt. Look at it that way.

846
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:52,428
Oh, yeah?
Is that the way I'm supposed to look at it?

847
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:53,850
Well, fine!

848
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:58,091
You can keep your stupid
phony contracting job.

849
00:35:58,162 --> 00:36:00,325
I'm through playing your patsy.

850
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,942
I'm through running your errands.

851
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:03,307
Hold on. That's no mayo.

852
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:04,343
Here, Ed.

853
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,962
I'm done. I quit.

854
00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:13,568
You can all kiss any part of me that reachers
your general vicinity first.

855
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,602
You have seen the last of me.

856
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:18,548
So arrivederci, Roma!

857
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:24,153
And to repay you all for this lousy
trick that you played on me,

858
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,059
you can all reach in here and grab
your own damn condiments.

859
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:29,841
That's dinner!

860
00:36:33,122 --> 00:36:33,815
Hit me.

861
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:36,006
That's your fourth milkshake, T.J.

862
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,265
It doesn't matter, Luke.

863
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:39,682
It's not like I got anywhere to go tomorrow.

864
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,346
So, you're not a contractor. Who cares?

865
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:44,410
Neither am I.
You don't see me crying about it.

866
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:46,974
I'm not crying about it... anymore.

867
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:47,986
It's not your thing.

868
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:51,089
Yeah, not my thing. I don't have a thing.

869
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,429
I have nothing.

870
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:54,098
You've got Liz, you've got your health.

871
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:55,339
I've got no dream.

872
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:56,895
I've got no future.

873
00:36:56,972 --> 00:36:59,201
What are you talking about,
you got no future?

874
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,403
Did you or did you not build these shelves?

875
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,065
I did.

876
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:04,655
Those are great shelves, T.J.

877
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:05,400
Stop it.

878
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:07,815
They are. There's real craftsmanship
that went into those--

879
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:11,160
well made, you got some nice carved detail.

880
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:14,751
That's a quality piece of merchandise,
and you made it.

881
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:15,690
Yeah. So?

882
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,097
So you should be proud of that.
Not everybody can do that.

883
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,720
So you're not a contractor.
You're a craftsman!

884
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,427
Wow. I'm a craftsman... like Jesus.

885
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,146
He built stuff for a while.

886
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:28,547
You're exactly like Jesus. That was my point.

887
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:33,626
Yeah. What am I getting so mopey about?
I mean, I build shelves.

888
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:37,059
I'm a craftsman who builds shelves,
like Jesus.

889
00:37:37,162 --> 00:37:39,817
And plus my day rate has just gone way up.

890
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:43,188
Yeah but T.J., that was a contractor's rate
you were being paid, not a shelfmaker's rate.

891
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:45,207
Yeah, but I wasn't really the contractor.

892
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:48,266
I know,
but that was-- Have a good night, T.J.

893
00:37:54,883 --> 00:37:56,926
Hey, just lying there-- what a surprise.

894
00:37:57,342 --> 00:38:02,614
Make sure you grind that smelly butt into
the rug good-- get that aroma
really locked in those fibers.

895
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:05,418
Oh, man.

896
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,576
Wow, you are fun to have around.

897
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:19,483
Oh, no.

898
00:38:20,301 --> 00:38:21,705
Oh, crap.

899
00:38:22,276 --> 00:38:23,285
Oh, god.

900
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:25,550
Tell me you didn't.

901
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:26,891
Tell me you didn't.

902
00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:28,046
There we go.

903
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:30,026
Oh, jeez.

904
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:44,220
Come on! Hey! Wake up! I got a dog out here!

905
00:38:48,352 --> 00:38:49,215
Can I help you?

906
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:50,571
The dog ate chocolate.

907
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,252
I don't know a lot about dogs,
but I do know they shouldn't eat chocolate.

908
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,900
I went to the animal hospital,
and they were closed.

909
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:57,676
Then I called Babette and she
told me where you lived.

910
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:58,948
And you got to do something.

911
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:01,270
Because this is not my dog.
This is my fiancé's dog.

912
00:39:01,342 --> 00:39:05,370
She loves him. She named him "Paul
Anka," which may on the surface
not seem like a sign of love,

913
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:08,697
but if you knew her, you'd get it. Believe
me, there's a lot of ways I
could screw up the relationship,

914
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:11,004
but I cannot lose her over
the fact I killed her dog.

915
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,819
I'll get the ipecac. Come on in.

916
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:17,844
So, I tell the guy, "hey,
there is no way all these potatoes

917
00:39:17,912 --> 00:39:21,860
could have been peeled if I had
waltzed in here at 12:00."

918
00:39:21,936 --> 00:39:24,011
He simply refused to believe me

919
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:27,030
or credit me with the hours,
so finally I just said,

920
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:30,571
"you know what?
There is another soup kitchen down on Hadley,

921
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:34,148
and they serve more vegetables than you do,
so I would rather work there anyhow."

922
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:36,244
And I turned in my apron, and I walked out.

923
00:39:36,315 --> 00:39:38,784
Wow. Rough world,
the world of community service.

924
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:40,879
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

925
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:44,744
I've done 125 hours, so I've got 175 to go,

926
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,963
which is a little off my goal,
but not by much, so I can deal.

927
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:50,427
I've got the candy-striper
thing starting next week.

928
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:52,188
I didn't really want that,
but I had to take it.

929
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:56,142
Because I was supposed to get on the zoo
beat, which would have been gross but great.

930
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:57,604
They'll let you do a double shift.

931
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:59,098
But they're always full.

932
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:00,900
- Weird, huh?
- Very weird.

933
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,024
I'm boring you.

934
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:03,908
Far from it. I just have to go.

935
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,698
I have to meet with my faculty adviser and
convince her that this is the year I'm
finally gonna make something of myself.

936
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:11,717
Well, don't tell her about the cheese-rolling
incident. She'll never believe you.

937
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,175
You want a walk back to your car?

938
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:14,956
No, I think I can make it by myself.

939
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:16,541
- Okay.
- Okay.

940
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:19,529
- I'll call you later?
- Okay.

941
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:49,920
Hey.

942
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,116
Hey. Sorry.

943
00:40:52,194 --> 00:40:53,934
I didn't mean to wake you. Go back to sleep.

944
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:54,907
No, it's okay.

945
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:56,358
I like to watch you hydrate.

946
00:40:56,597 --> 00:40:57,964
Oh, man.

947
00:40:58,138 --> 00:40:59,145
When did you get home?

948
00:40:59,268 --> 00:41:00,109
I didn't hear you come in.

949
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,859
You were conked out pretty good--

950
00:41:01,953 --> 00:41:03,205
- Oh yeah.
- Both of you.

951
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:04,150
Yeah.

952
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:06,172
How did it go with Paul Anka last night?

953
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:09,678
Well, first off, he ate 3 pounds
of unsweetened baking chocolate,

954
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:11,120
so I had to rush him to the vet--

955
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,584
to his house because the animal
hospital was closed--

956
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:18,020
and he forced some sort of vomit-inducing
medicine down Paul Anka's throat,

957
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:21,752
and then Paul Anka proceeded to throw
up for the next hour and a half.

958
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:24,191
and after that,
I sat with him for another three hours,

959
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:28,581
holding a bowl of water under his nose to
make sure that he was rehydrating properly,

960
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:33,041
and then I chocolate-proofed the
apartment and the diner to make
sure that never happens again.

961
00:41:33,148 --> 00:41:37,395
And now I'm gonna go downstairs and
make Paul Anka some scrambled eggs

962
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:41,507
because the vet said that the kibble
is gonna be a little hard on his
stomach for a couple of days.

963
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:44,037
Does he have any particular fear of cheddar?

964
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,491
'Cause I thought I'd throw that
in to make it taste better.

965
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:50,656
Luke?

966
00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:51,681
Yeah?

967
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,864
I don't want to set a wedding date
until things are right with Rory.

968
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,530
Okay.

969
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:04,089
So, the cheddar is...

970
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,361
Okay.

971
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:15,679
The dining-hall hours are cast in stone.

972
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:16,957
You snooze, you lose.

973
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,212
And your school-issued I.D.s
are your new best friends.

974
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:20,957
Become inseparable.

975
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,422
You'll be asked for it constantly.
So give it a nickname and learn to commit.

976
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:27,003
It operates the laundry room.
It is your meal card.

977
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,090
Every new student at Yale will
learn the value of the I.D.

978
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:41,167
Every new member of the D.A.R.
will feel instantly the sense of camaraderie

979
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:44,043
that has become synonymous with the D.A.R.

980
00:42:44,113 --> 00:42:48,507
As certified members of the Hartford chapter
of the daughters of the American revolution,

981
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:52,558
you will hold a very special and esteemed
place in this community.

982
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:56,333
But with that great esteem comes
great responsibility--

983
00:42:56,403 --> 00:42:59,920
to your chapter, to your town,
and to your nation.

984
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:02,308
This is a proud moment for me

985
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:04,238
as I, your president,

986
00:43:04,304 --> 00:43:08,504
welcome the new members of the daughters
of the American revolution.
