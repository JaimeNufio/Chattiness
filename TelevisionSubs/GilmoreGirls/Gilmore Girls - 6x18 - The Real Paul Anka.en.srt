1
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:04,367
Hey, you.

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:07,298
Okay, so weird dream. Weird, weird dream.

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,004
Weirder than the one where you
step into a boxing ring

4
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:10,967
and your hands are suddenly
giant cream puffs?

5
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:12,202
Weirder, scarier.

6
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:12,934
Let's hear it.

7
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:15,407
Well, I was home, and I was finishing
up my usual morning routine--

8
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:16,876
you know, coffee, shower.

9
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:18,962
And then-- picture this, very weird--

10
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:20,767
I take Paul Anka for a walk.

11
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:22,726
You walk Paul Anka every day.
What's weird about that?

12
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:25,224
Not the dog Paul Anka. The real Paul Anka.

13
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,454
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:27,221
Was he nice?

15
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:30,165
Very pleasant, natty dresser. Then suddenly,
he sees something,

16
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,422
a cat or something, and darts right
into the middle of the street.

17
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:33,435
The real Paul Anka?

18
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:34,670
The dog Paul Anka.

19
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:36,935
So I call him and call him,
but he completely ignores me

20
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,561
and runs right into Doose's market.

21
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:39,867
You didn't train him well enough.

22
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:41,563
Too much affection, not enough discipline.

23
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:44,457
So I go after him into Doose's,
and apparently, he's got a job there.

24
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,333
The dog Paul Anka?

25
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:47,429
The real Paul Anka.

26
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:50,601
You picked yourself some beautiful
cucumbers, Mrs. Clancey.

27
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:52,466
You have the cucumber eye.

28
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,604
So I run out of Doose's,
and I'm approaching Luke's apartment--

29
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:56,709
I guess to get help or something-- and
I'm walking to the door,

30
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,933
and I open it, and there's Paul Anka,
in front of a microphone,
giving a little concert.

31
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:01,887
The real Paul Anka.

32
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:03,127
The dog Paul Anka.

33
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:05,266
Couldn't have been happy,
you interrupting his show like that.

34
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:09,275
He didn't notice. So I go down to the diner,
and there, lo and behold,

35
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,845
is Paul Anka sitting on Babette's lap.

36
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:14,080
- Please don't tell me it was--
- The real Paul Anka.

37
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:17,426
Good boy. Who's a good boy?

38
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:18,426
This is crazy.

39
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:20,801
Coming to the end.
So the real Paul Anka looks outside,

40
00:01:20,802 --> 00:01:24,665
and there, sitting in the middle of the
street staring at him is dog Paul Anka.

41
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,194
So real Paul Anka gets up
and runs out of Luke's.

42
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:28,623
They're both in the street now--

43
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:30,801
real Paul Anka walking toward dog Paul Anka,

44
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:33,344
dog Paul Anka toward real Paul Anka.

45
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,870
You can sense that something
very bad is about to happen,

46
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,542
when suddenly they meet in the
middle of the street, and bam!

47
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:41,377
An otherworldly white light
engulfs the whole town,

48
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:45,249
and there's a loud explosion and two barks,
and everything goes dark.

49
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:46,191
And?

50
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:47,028
And then I woke up.

51
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:47,757
Wow.

52
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:48,961
- Yeah.
- Okay.

53
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:50,690
So I guess I was wondering
if you'd heard anything

54
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:53,971
about a small Connecticut town being
sucked up into an evil demon vortex

55
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:56,063
or cast into the fourth
dimension or anything.

56
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:56,610
No.

57
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:58,008
Real Paul Anka still kicking?

58
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,763
Haven't heard otherwise. Check your hands.

59
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:00,582
No cream puffs.

60
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,907
I think you're good to start your day.

61
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:03,218
- Thanks, hon.
- Anytime.

62
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,457
Bye.

63
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,275
- You're gonna do fine.
- Says you.

64
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:14,397
And everybody else. You know the place
backwards and forwards, Caesar.

65
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:16,703
- You've never been gone this long.
- You're gonna do fine.

66
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:17,998
Stop saying that. It's bad luck.

67
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:21,262
Then you're gonna stink. You're gonna blow up
the stove and give everybody salmonella.

68
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:22,382
Why do you say that?

69
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,754
Because if it's bad luck to say good things,
it's good luck to say bad things.

70
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,425
- You're rooting for me to fail.
- I'm not rooting for you to fail.

71
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:29,943
Lorelai, tell him he's gonna do great.

72
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,193
And jinx it for him? No way.

73
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:31,721
Thank you.

74
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:32,741
You're both nuts.

75
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,128
I could run the place if you want, Luke.

76
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,282
Hmm, let me search down to
the very depth of my being

77
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:39,415
to see if there's the slightest
inclination I would want that.

78
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,792
- Nope.
- Just checking.

79
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:41,411
What's that?

80
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:44,039
I brought it over last night.
I figured you'd need it for hanging stuff.

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,332
I'm not bringing hanging stuff.

82
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,631
Well, you should bring some
nice clothes just in case.

83
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:49,272
I threw in some slacks and your black jacket.

84
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:51,966
It's a field trip with a bunch of
12-year-olds. I'm not gonna need nicer stuff.

85
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:52,698
Just in case.

86
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,703
It's 10 days of diners and fast food,
nothing requiring slacks or jackets.

87
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,861
See, that's what the phrase
"just in case" covers--

88
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:01,280
the times you think you've anticipated
every possible need.

89
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,935
All right. I'll bring it.

90
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:05,062
You know, there was a flash flood
in El Salvador last night.

91
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,363
No, my Salvadoran paper didn't come today.

92
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,074
They didn't see it coming.

93
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:09,840
That's the flash part of flash flood.

94
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:13,123
So, what do I do if I see a flash flood
coming straight at the diner?

95
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:15,276
Make sure all the customers have settled up.

96
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:16,857
It's all a big joke to you.

97
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,623
So you're taking this, huh?

98
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:21,120
The old one's a mess.

99
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:22,293
You don't think I should?

100
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,651
No, it's just you think it's sturdy enough?

101
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:25,766
Yeah, I think it should be.

102
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,411
Well, it's always best to take
something that a gorilla

103
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,493
could jump up and down on and not wreck.

104
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:33,207
I don't think a gorilla has tested it,
but if it busts,

105
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,651
I'll just pick up something on the road.

106
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:35,507
That'll work.

107
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,656
All right, I should get going.

108
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:38,544
Anna's stuck at the house
until I pick up April.

109
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:39,815
Well, let's get you on the road.

110
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:41,814
It's good timing, too. Caesar's in the back.

111
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,457
Sure you don't want to reconsider my offer?

112
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,565
I've got a hairnet on me,
so I can start immediately.

113
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:46,518
Offer declined.

114
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,262
- You take that. I'll take this.
- Perfect.

115
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:53,214
Oh. Oops.

116
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:01,903
Wait! Wait!

117
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:02,930
He's unstoppable.

118
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:03,920
It's cute.

119
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,289
We need to confirm the itinerary.

120
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,912
As we've done 1,000 times?
Sure, let's confirm it.

121
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:09,615
Today's the kids' math contest in Newark.

122
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:11,921
In my day,
you learned two plus two and you stayed home.

123
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:14,923
Today they got contests,
they go on the road like they're Metallica.

124
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:18,094
And then tomorrow night's Philadelphia.
Did I tell you we're dropping in on Jess?

125
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:19,054
Jess? No.

126
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:20,374
Yeah, this place he works.

127
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,674
They put out this zine and
books and whatever else.

128
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:24,241
They're having an open house.
I'm taking April.

129
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,168
It'll give Jess a chance to
meet his little cousin.

130
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:27,624
Oh, sounds great.

131
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,348
- So anywhere in the back?
- Anywhere's fine.

132
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,141
Hey, day six-- if your cell dies, is there a
phone in Gettysburg I could reach you at?

133
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:35,907
Yeah, the one Grant used to call
Lincoln-- number's in the book.

134
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:38,551
Oh, good. He's a funnyman today.
He's Jerry Lewis.

135
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,459
Caesar, calm down. You're gonna do great.

136
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,634
You're the best cook Luke's ever had.

137
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:43,521
You so make better pancakes than he does.

138
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:44,960
- True.
- No, he doesn't.

139
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:46,045
You just have to be confident.

140
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,966
It's just when I'm working the grill,
sometimes I get a locked elbow.

141
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,433
And Luke's the only one who knows how
to rub it to get it working again.

142
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,352
- He rubs your elbow?
- It's like a sports injury.

143
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,160
It's okay if it's sports. You want to step
back 3 feet so I can say goodbye to my girl?

144
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:58,239
Fine.

145
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,842
You gonna miss me?

146
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,058
Especially if my elbow hurts.

147
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:01,877
I'm gonna call you a lot.

148
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:02,804
Same here.

149
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:06,225
You know, I was happy when she asked me,
but now it just struck me.

150
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:08,580
I'm gonna spend 10 days with
a bus full of teenagers.

151
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:09,803
I think you're ready.

152
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:11,866
Thanks for seeing me off.

153
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:13,146
Your pancakes are better, by the way.

154
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:14,163
Thanks.

155
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,196
Don't worry, Luke. Just a momentary panic.

156
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:17,794
I'm gonna be fine, I promise.

157
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,407
Good.
Now go back in there and reclaim your turf.

158
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:22,751
Reclaim my turf?

159
00:06:25,015 --> 00:06:26,305
Kirk!

160
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:32,838
What are you doing, Kirk?
You don't work here!

161
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,882
I'm bad with names,
so help me with the names.

162
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,083
You ever use mnemonic devices?

163
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:50,529
Uh, maybe.

164
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,328
They help you remember things.

165
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,804
Uh, like Curtis Shuran. He's from Kurdistan.

166
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:55,314
Really?

167
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,312
No, he's from Detroit.
That's a mnemonic device.

168
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:59,254
Curtis Shuran from Kurdistan. Got it.

169
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:01,510
Jamie Alvarado likes to try avocados.

170
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:03,183
Meg Shatsworth, Haywood's fatsworth.

171
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:06,079
Shatsworth, fatworth. Alvarado, avocado.

172
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,530
And those are your fellow grups.

173
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:08,203
The what?

174
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:09,952
Grown-ups.
You never saw the original "Star Trek"?

175
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:11,714
Oh, yes, grups. Yes, I did.

176
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:14,386
The one in the cords is our math teacher,
Mr. Munster.

177
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:18,105
Good guy, he's a little nerdy, likes to wow
us with his Chris Rock impersonation.

178
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:19,310
It's borderline racist.

179
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:21,303
Well, let's leave the bags here,
get the lay of the land first.

180
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:22,718
Well, this is pretty much the land.

181
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:25,142
There must be some kind of check-in
point and protocol to follow,

182
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:26,457
so just stick with me, okay?

183
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,394
Or you just run on the bus.
That's really good.

184
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:30,206
- Hello, there. You our pilot?
- Your what?

185
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,154
Are you the driver?

186
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:32,448
Me? No.

187
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:33,646
I'm Luke Danes.

188
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:36,253
Oh, you're Luke Danes. Sorry.
We thought you were our driver.

189
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:39,303
No, no, sorry. I, uh, you know,
I have nicer clothes than this.

190
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:41,048
I won't always be wearing these.

191
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:43,913
That's okay. I'm Earl Stepton.
This is Kelly Turlington.

192
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:46,447
You probably know Roy Munster,
your daughter's teacher.

193
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:49,043
Actually, no. I'm April's new father--

194
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:51,638
I mean, not new, but new to her. So, hey.

195
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,922
- She's a bright one, your daughter.
- Go figure.

196
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,357
- Hey, Luke!
- Yeah?

197
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,154
Some people in here are
wondering who you are.

198
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:58,687
Oh, well, go ahead and tell them.

199
00:07:58,688 --> 00:07:59,809
That's Luke.

200
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,429
So here's the detailed itinerary.

201
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,894
Lunch stops, snack stops.

202
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:04,752
- Wander time, exploring time.
- TV time.

203
00:08:04,753 --> 00:08:06,455
Porn will be preblocked at all our lodgings.

204
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:07,741
Okay, so no porn.

205
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:09,081
Study breaks, check-in with parents.

206
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:10,953
- Bedtime hours.
- So we go to bed at 9:00?

207
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:12,130
The kids do. You don't have to.

208
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,275
Right, but I can?

209
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:14,528
- Sure.
- Okay, great.

210
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,294
Shall we get on board so they
don't leave without us?

211
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,280
Well, I still have my bags.

212
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,072
- Okay, see you on the bus.
- Okay.

213
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,995
Kelly Turlington from Burlington.

214
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,506
Roy Munster's a punster.

215
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:26,851
Hey, you.

216
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:27,964
Hey.

217
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,104
You get in late last night?

218
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:30,105
I was studying.

219
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:32,635
Hmm. Missed my class this morning.

220
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:33,652
Bummer.

221
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:35,352
Clock didn't go off.
I thought I set it right.

222
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:37,367
Oh, I reset it.
I had to catch up on some sleep.

223
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:39,563
- I didn't know you set it for early.
- Honest mistake.

224
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,324
Maybe we should get a second clock.

225
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:42,891
Might be wise.

226
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:44,534
You gonna be available to grab a bite later?

227
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:45,437
Maybe.

228
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,028
You can't see that far into the future?

229
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,802
It's crazy right now.

230
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:49,935
I'll check in with you later.

231
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:51,374
We'll see how it goes.

232
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,125
- Have a good day.
- You too.

233
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:04,131
There's holmium and helium
and hafnium and erbium

234
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:06,885
And phosphorous and francium
and fluorine and terbium

235
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:09,464
And manganese and mercury,
molybdenum, magnesium

236
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,160
Dysprosium and scandium and cerium and cesium

237
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:14,796
And lead, praseodymium, platinum, plutonium

238
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:17,326
Palladium, promethium, potassium, polonium

239
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:20,865
And tantalum, technetium, titanium, tellurium

240
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,117
And cadmium and calcium
and chromium and curium

241
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:28,417
There's sulfur,
californium and fermium, berkelium

242
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:31,069
And also mendelevium, einsteinium, nobelium

243
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,583
And argon, krypton, neon, radon, xenon, zinc,
and rhodium

244
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:37,064
And chlorine, carbon, cobalt, copper,
tungsten, tin, and sodium

245
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:42,409
These are the only ones of which
the news has come to Harvard

246
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,130
And there may be many others but
they haven't been discovered

247
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:49,826
What was all that?

248
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:51,057
It's all the chemical elements.

249
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,713
At least the ones that have come to Harvard.

250
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:56,387
Any idea what's going on here?

251
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,597
...14201995611...

252
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,491
- That's Frank.
- Huge show-off.

253
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:05,392
Always rubbing our faces in the fact that
he knows the first 300 digits of pi.

254
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:06,564
Of course.

255
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,835
Hey, did you bring my sweater?

256
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:08,757
I think so.

257
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,476
It's important, Marsha. I need that sweater.

258
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,845
What is it, your lucky sweater?

259
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:13,668
No, Freddie.

260
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:17,025
Hey, is Munster gonna wear that creepy
lucky tie of his at competition?

261
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:18,485
Oh, God, I hope not.

262
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,893
Supposedly, there's lucky underwear to match.

263
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:22,146
Mental image, begone.

264
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:23,714
I heard he lives with his mother.

265
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:25,776
I heard he plays the trombone for fun.

266
00:10:25,777 --> 00:10:26,908
He's a liar, too--

267
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:29,894
he says he was a Red Sox fan,
but he didn't even know they traded Damon.

268
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,993
Really? He didn't know Damon
was with the Yankees now?

269
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:32,584
No.

270
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:34,131
You see Steinbrenner made him cut his hair?

271
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:35,638
Yeah, he looks way less scary.

272
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,492
Yeah, less intimidating to pitchers.

273
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:40,279
It's gonna shave 20 points
off his batting average.

274
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:42,043
Hey, what's that kid's name?

275
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:43,420
Freddie. His name is Freddie.

276
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:46,359
Freddie, Freddie,
apple-brown Betty-- nice kid.

277
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,711
Yeah, well, I should study.

278
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:50,086
You got it.

279
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,893
Mr. and Mrs. Moore,
your horses are saddled and ready.

280
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:59,193
Now, Cletus is very gentle,
but they're both sweethearts.

281
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,844
Rob is outside to help you get started.

282
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:02,784
- Thank you.
- Okay, have fun.

283
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:05,005
Mrs. Kim, hi.

284
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:06,814
You let women ride horses?

285
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:08,022
Yes.

286
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:11,840
- I have a request.
- All right.

287
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:12,975
This is a wedding dress.

288
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,853
It's the dress I wore when I married
Mr. Kim 28 years ago.

289
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:18,196
Hmm, khaki with a big zipper down the middle.

290
00:11:18,197 --> 00:11:20,380
Fashion is a fluctuating thing, huh?

291
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,421
Oh, oh, the dress is inside.

292
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,711
Right.
I would like Lane to wear it at her wedding.

293
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:25,535
Oh, how nice.

294
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:27,467
But it's a tad big. Lane is smaller than me.

295
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,358
It might need a hem,
and the sleeves should be shortened.

296
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,156
Makes sense.

297
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,639
I would like you to alter it for Lane.

298
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,269
Well, of course. I would love to.

299
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,305
Lane would like that, too.

300
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:35,589
Anything for her.

301
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,205
Alterations should be minor.

302
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,361
Just take it in a little here and there,
and that should do it.

303
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:41,389
Okay, I'll give Lane a call and
bring her in for a fitting.

304
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,456
Not necessary. Here's her height and
arm length-- that's all you need.

305
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:45,790
I'll get right on it.

306
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,683
Thank you.

307
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:49,346
Do they at least ride sidesaddle, the women?

308
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:51,127
Yes, every single one of them.

309
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,308
Good.

310
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:03,027
Uh, Paris, what's going on here?

311
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:04,341
I just need 10 more minutes.

312
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:07,372
I took a delete-boring-answers pass on my
interview with professor Whittington

313
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,858
and ended up with a tidy 16-word piece.

314
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,040
His wife must want to suck
a tail pipe every night.

315
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,326
I'm putting stuff back in now.

316
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:15,525
I meant with the big jar
of disgusting insects.

317
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,084
Oh. They're fruit flies.

318
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:19,304
I'm finishing an important paper
on population genetics,

319
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,753
and I have to monitor how often drosophila
melanogaster do the nasty.

320
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:23,579
Gross.

321
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,690
Complain to God, not me.

322
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,300
Did you have to bring them into the newsroom?

323
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:27,656
I can't just leave them home.

324
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,467
They could escape and infest my apartment.

325
00:12:29,468 --> 00:12:31,453
Meaning they could escape
and infest the newsroom.

326
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:32,917
At least no one sleeps in the newsroom,

327
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,937
and if they bring food and
flies get in the food,

328
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:37,739
maybe that's how they'll learn to follow
the "no food in the newsroom" rule.

329
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,341
- We don't have that rule.
- We should.

330
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,034
- Get them out of here.
- I need 9 minutes.

331
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:42,280
- Paris.
- 8 1/2.

332
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,051
Come on. You want the interview,
I got to keep typing.

333
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,757
- Okay, 9 minutes.
- Thanks.

334
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:47,128
Hey, chief, got a minute?

335
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:48,502
Um, a minute.

336
00:12:48,503 --> 00:12:50,031
I'm a little confused about something.

337
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,053
How can I help?

338
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:54,331
I was working on the piece about textbook
prices. You assigned it
to me a couple of weeks ago.

339
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:56,525
It wasn't gonna earn me my Pulitzer,
but I already put a lot of work into it,

340
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,556
and I just checked the server and
noticed that a piece on the
same topic's been written.

341
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:00,723
Yes, it has been.

342
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:02,724
- Our wires get crossed?
- Nope.

343
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:04,251
- Who wrote it?
- I did.

344
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:05,083
Why?

345
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,278
It's topical. It affects every student.

346
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,307
It's an important story.
I wanted to be sure that it would get done.

347
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:10,588
It wasn't due for two more days.

348
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,907
I didn't think you'd meet the deadline.

349
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:14,044
- Based on what?
- Based on past performance.

350
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:16,305
Past performance is no indication
of future performance.

351
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:17,958
Wise men call that a sucker's maxim.

352
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,469
I did a lot of research on this thing.
I interviewed textbook publishers.

353
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,631
I interviewed authors.
I was gonna get more quotes from students.

354
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:24,263
I know. I used your research.

355
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:25,443
A lot of it came in handy.

356
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:26,029
Really?

357
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,613
The stuff that I could make sense out of.

358
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:28,339
Good.

359
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
Look, you'll get your by-line,
if that's what this is about.

360
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:31,869
You know that's not what this is about.

361
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,202
I thought I was doing you a favor.

362
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,589
Everyone knew I was assigned that piece,

363
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,038
and now they know it's been
taken away from me.

364
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,864
Logan, I'm sorry. It's as you said.

365
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,276
Our wires got crossed. It happens.
Let's move on.

366
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,739
Okay, we'll move on.

367
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:44,756
- And what's with this?
- Keep walking, Whitey.

368
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,174
You let fruit flies in the newsroom?

369
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,862
- It's not hurting anybody.
- It's disgusting.

370
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:50,030
- I just need five more minutes.
- Don't rush, Paris.

371
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,790
The fruit flies are not hurting anybody,

372
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,175
and Paris is working on something
that I'm waiting on.

373
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:56,584
I would prefer it if she weren't interrupted.

374
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,058
Sorry, Paris.

375
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,549
All right. Guys, just remind me-- who's
allergic to dairy?

376
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,353
There you go. No mayo.

377
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:13,135
Who's allergic to wheat?

378
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:15,044
There you go, Tori, bound for glory.

379
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:16,856
- And who's low sodium?
- Right here.

380
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,734
There you go, apple-brown Betty Freddie,
no salt.

381
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:23,543
- Uh, hey.
- Hey.

382
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:26,829
You know,
I'm still mad about that math competition.

383
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:29,325
Those buzzers in the countdown
round were rigged.

384
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,300
I know they were.
The judges were on the take.

385
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,774
He's called a moderator, actually.

386
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:36,462
Yeah, well, whatever they are.
I'm lodging a protest.

387
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:38,759
Luke, could we talk for a sec?

388
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,900
Sure.

389
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,139
What's up?

390
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:46,724
You know Freddie, right?

391
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:48,010
Yeah, good kid.

392
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,928
Well, I-I like him.

393
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:53,867
Oh, well, I like him, too.
He seems less insane than the others.

394
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:56,539
I don't mean like him the way you like him,
I hope.

395
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,475
You've known him longer.

396
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:58,307
And I'm a girl.

397
00:14:58,308 --> 00:14:59,052
I know that.

398
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:00,557
And he's a boy.

399
00:15:00,558 --> 00:15:01,861
I know that, too.

400
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:03,863
Oh! You like him.

401
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:05,125
- Shh!
- Sorry.

402
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:07,153
I'm not quite ready to proclaim
it to the world yet.

403
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:09,592
Are you old enough to like a boy?

404
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:10,598
I'm not sure.

405
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:13,552
I'll have to look it up in a book,
see whether you're supposed to like boys yet.

406
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:14,714
It's a fact either which way.

407
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,370
Okay, so what do you want me to do?

408
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:18,680
For starters, it would help if
you stopped calling him Betty.

409
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:19,493
Right.

410
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:22,721
And you sitting next to me all the time
is kind of getting in the way.

411
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,692
Oh, jeez, I didn't realize.

412
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:25,884
I know. You're pretty oblivious.

413
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,411
- It seems like Freddie is--
- Don't look at him!

414
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:31,343
Sorry. You pay less attention to
Freddie than the other boys.

415
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:32,469
It's because I like him.

416
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,598
- You like him, so you ignore him?
- It's the way it works.

417
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,750
But you're always palling around with Kevin.

418
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,075
- Kevin makes me sick.
- I'm confused.

419
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:38,944
- You're overthinking this.
- I must be.

420
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:41,306
- Don't look at him!
- I'm sorry.

421
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,796
Well, shouldn't be sitting
next to you, then, huh?

422
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:48,226
Maybe not.

423
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,517
Guess I'll go sit with the parents.

424
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:51,757
I think that's a good idea.

425
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,109
Okay.

426
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:56,736
You want to go back together,
or should we stagger it a little?

427
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:58,533
Give me a four-second head start.

428
00:15:58,534 --> 00:15:59,893
You got it.

429
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,225
The bottle was dry.

430
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:06,701
You cannot be out of wild turkey.

431
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:09,141
I've got everything else under the sun.
Pick one and stop your nagging.

432
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:10,996
You cannot be out of wild turkey.

433
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,572
No matter how many times
you tell me I'm not out

434
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:13,909
doesn't change the fact that I'm out.

435
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,175
Hands.

436
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:16,249
Jerk.

437
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,292
Hi, everyone.

438
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,778
Hey, Rory. Get yourself a drink.
Anything but wild turkey.

439
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:20,636
I'm okay.

440
00:16:20,637 --> 00:16:22,718
Yeah, forget it.
She doesn't drink on school nights.

441
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:23,834
I sometimes do.

442
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:26,974
I'm getting a sense that the woman of the
house had no idea we were going to be here.

443
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:27,961
Okay that we're here, love?

444
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:28,765
Of course it's okay.

445
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:31,364
Logan, I haven't called you love
since that night in Bimini.

446
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,372
It's fine that you're here, guys.
You're always welcome.

447
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:34,276
What's with the maps?

448
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:35,982
Graduation is imminent, Rory.

449
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:39,153
So we are planning the Ultimate
Life and Death Brigade event.

450
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:41,111
Not only the ultimate, but the penultimate.

451
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:43,295
Penultimate means next to last, Finn.

452
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:44,626
This is the last one.

453
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:46,006
I thought it meant super-ultimate.

454
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,121
How did you get into Yale?

455
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,072
Slept with the recruiter.

456
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,081
So, what's the stunt?

457
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:52,475
We're flown on a twin-engine plane
to a remote spot in Costa Rica.

458
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:55,720
We don parachutes,
base-jump off a cliff whose height is...

459
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:59,499
Exactly 3,624 feet, unless that's a 2.

460
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,494
We land on the banks of the San Juan river.

461
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:02,465
Hopefully not in the river.

462
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:03,886
Or on the Nicaraguan side of the river.

463
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:04,773
Or in Panama.

464
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,687
We inflate a raft, white-water three
miles down to a meeting point,

465
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:09,417
where a blowout party will take place.

466
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:12,164
It's a 2, gents. I'm pretty sure it's a 2...
or an 8.

467
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,615
Where do you get the inflatable raft?

468
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,472
One of us will parachute
with it in our packs.

469
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:16,920
Not me, I've got the DVD player.

470
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:18,491
Not me, I've got the champagne and the bong.

471
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:20,086
If I take it, it'll crush the cigars.

472
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,423
Stand down, boys. I'll jump with the raft.

473
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:24,286
You're planning this all
very carefully, right?

474
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:27,198
Luckily, we have a topographical-map
expert in our midst.

475
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,090
It's a 3. I'm 90% sure.

476
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,824
Why don't you make extra sure you have
the right number there, Robert?

477
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,414
Hey, let the man do his thing.

478
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:35,573
Well, I would if the man doing
his thing weren't drunk

479
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:38,081
and hadn't forgotten to put
on his reading glasses.

480
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:39,516
Oh, my God. I'm not wearing my glasses.

481
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,668
They flew off when you did that impression of
the old guy getting shot by Dick Cheney.

482
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:44,770
Who's flying this twin-engine airplane,

483
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:46,873
and who's supplying the parachutes?

484
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:50,077
I mean, there must be a weight limit
to make that jump, right?

485
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:51,383
Do you guys know what the weight limit is?

486
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:52,862
So you came home just to piss on the fun?

487
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,208
No, I came home because I live here.

488
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:59,481
You know, guys, maybe we should resume
our planning another time.

489
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:00,764
Yeah, I guess maybe we should.

490
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:02,231
I'll never be able to refold these.

491
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:04,477
Just grab them and let's go, Robert.

492
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:06,122
Okay if I return this another time?

493
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:07,439
Sure.

494
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:09,986
Go with them if you want.

495
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:13,773
Is it your life mission to embarrass
me at every opportunity you get?

496
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,765
It's Robert, Colin, and Finn, Logan.

497
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,990
I've seen them all dance naked
with underwear on their heads.

498
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,492
There's no embarrassing you in front of them.

499
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,050
Well, you embarrassed me tonight.

500
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:24,681
How, by pointing out that the stunt you're
planning doesn't exactly sound safe?

501
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:26,661
It's called the Life and Death Brigade, Rory.

502
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:29,228
Yeah, and you're supposed to
try to avoid the death part.

503
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:31,470
This is not your business,
and why aren't you at the paper?

504
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,054
You're always at the paper
at this time of night.

505
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:33,934
Finished early.

506
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:36,775
How? You delegate a little,
let people write their own articles?

507
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:37,806
That's old news.

508
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:40,457
It's not old news.
You knew that would embarrass me,
and you didn't care.

509
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,104
Please.

510
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:42,837
Even when we're together,
you're someplace else.

511
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:44,222
You leave, and you don't kiss me goodbye.

512
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,307
At dinner,
you're on your cellphone the whole time.

513
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:47,958
You never leave notes anymore
about where you're gonna be

514
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,260
so I've no idea where you are.

515
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,414
- You haven't forgiven me.
- What are you talking about?

516
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:53,134
For the girls I was with
when we were separated.

517
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:54,289
I said I forgive you.

518
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,013
Yeah, you said it, but you haven't, though.

519
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:57,594
You haven't.

520
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,592
I'll be at the pub.

521
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,634
Lorelai!

522
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:11,616
Hi, Lane.

523
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,478
You're in possession.

524
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,123
Of what?

525
00:19:13,124 --> 00:19:13,966
Of the wedding dress.

526
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:17,568
Oh, um, yeah. It's safe and sound.
I was just starting to dig into it.

527
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:19,973
Don't dig. Slice, kill, maim, destroy.

528
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:20,384
What?

529
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:23,421
Sic a mad pack of wolves on it. Douse it
with lighter fluid and turn it into ash.

530
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:24,606
I cannot wear that dress.

531
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:26,117
Yeah, I know. It's a little old-world.

532
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:27,564
- Have you looked at it?
- Parts of it.

533
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:29,355
Exactly. You can't take it in at once.

534
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:30,948
The human eyeball is not capable.

535
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:33,157
- It's not that bad.
- It's got pants.

536
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:33,928
No!

537
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:35,551
You didn't look at it very carefully.

538
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:37,067
Well, I will remove the pants.

539
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:40,484
Oh, it's every girl's dream to hear the
woman altering her wedding dress say,

540
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:41,531
"I'll remove the pants."

541
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:43,251
I'm sure once I alter it a little--

542
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:46,149
No, don't alter it. Have an accident.
Leave a warm iron on it.

543
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,156
Spill a vat of acid on it.
Run your car over it.

544
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:49,904
Lane, Lane,
I haven't even put it on the mannequin yet.

545
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,148
Now, let me start work on it,

546
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,650
and I will keep you fully posted
every step of the way and--

547
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,386
- Oh, my God...
- What? My mom?

548
00:19:57,387 --> 00:20:00,193
No, my mom and dad.
I thought I saw something.

549
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:03,435
Well, focus, focus.
Important topic we're discussing here.

550
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,884
All right, I got to run. I'll call you later.

551
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:06,246
Lorelai!

552
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:12,717
I'm not above bribing.

553
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,280
Ah, Lane, don't sneak up on me like that.

554
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,930
It's all about the Hamiltons, baby.

555
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:17,745
You can't pay me to ruin your dress.

556
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:20,320
Look, forget about your parents for
a minute and concentrate on this.

557
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,152
Wait, so you saw them, too? I'm not insane?

558
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,379
They've been walking around town all morning.

559
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,456
All morning? Any guess as to why?

560
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,868
Shred the dress, and I'll tell you.

561
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:27,857
Do you really know why?

562
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:28,368
No.

563
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,114
Well, then I'm not gonna ruin the dress.

564
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:32,150
Well, I did see them talking to Kirk earlier.

565
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:32,912
Kirk?

566
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,597
Yeah, and he was wearing his maroon jacket.

567
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:37,963
His real-estate jacket. This is not good!
This is not good!

568
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:41,650
My life is in your hands. I don't think
you're fully comprehending that fact.

569
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,346
I guess I'm going.

570
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:51,762
Okay.

571
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,780
I'll be out of cellphone
range for a couple days.

572
00:20:54,781 --> 00:20:56,137
I know.

573
00:20:58,196 --> 00:20:59,495
I'll see you.

574
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,020
Kirk!

575
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:12,334
- Kirk!
- Mask!

576
00:21:12,385 --> 00:21:13,275
What?

577
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:14,423
Mask.

578
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:15,538
What is this?

579
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,029
I've done it, Lorelai.
I finally landed my first listing.

580
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,532
Where are my parents?

581
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,983
This is the beginning of my rise to the
top of the real-estate industry.

582
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:25,184
Where are my parents?

583
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:27,896
Do you happen to be in the market for
a house? 'Cause this baby's a honey.

584
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:29,117
Something in the corner just moved.

585
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:32,134
Just a rat. I'd have told you about
them before you bought the place.

586
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:35,997
The law also requires me to inform
you that the house has toxic mold,

587
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:38,209
asbestos, methane gas,

588
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,106
buckling floors, a crumbling foundation,

589
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:43,806
visible fungus, a collapsed fireplace,

590
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:45,812
ceiling damage, water damage,

591
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:48,060
and it was the recent site
of a Wicca convention

592
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:50,910
and a particularly grisly murder/suicide--

593
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:52,193
nothing we can't work with.

594
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:53,323
I'm not in the market, Kirk.

595
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:56,805
Now, listen,
I know my parents are shopping for houses.
Lane saw you with them.

596
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:58,246
And I need to know where they are right now.

597
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:00,281
I'm sorry. That's confidential information.

598
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:02,404
In fact, the fact that I was
with them was confidential.

599
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:06,029
So I'm gonna have to ask you to pretend that
I haven't already confirmed
that I was with them,

600
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,212
which I wasn't.

601
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:08,402
God, what was that?

602
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:12,952
Bat. Don't worry.
When you spray for cockroaches,
the bats die, too, usually.

603
00:22:12,953 --> 00:22:16,177
At the very least, it knocks the wind out of
them so they wind up wobbling on the floor,

604
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:18,859
so you can just whack them with a
hammer-- nothing we can't work with.

605
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,859
Kirk, I am your friend,
but they are my parents,

606
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,269
and I need to find them right now.
It's important.

607
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,678
Well, I shouldn't tell you this, but

608
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,375
I know they were looking at two
properties on Maple Drive.

609
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:30,066
They're probably around there right now.

610
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,502
Too bad I couldn't get them interested
in this property.

611
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:34,223
It has great bones.

612
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,704
Literally. There's an Indian
burial ground underneath it.

613
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,094
Thanks. See ya.

614
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,142
Don't run. It scares the bat.

615
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:19,307
Mom, dad! Wow, what are you doing here?

616
00:23:19,308 --> 00:23:20,867
Hey, did we have something set up?

617
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,249
- Uh, no.
- No.

618
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,776
No? Then what's up?

619
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,199
- Well, we're here to, um...
- Do a little antiquing.

620
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,613
- Antiquing.
- Right, antiquing.

621
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:31,400
We're hitting Litchfield, Woodbridge,
Washington depot.

622
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:34,800
Well, we have some great antique stores
right here in little old Stars Hollow.

623
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:35,815
That's what brings us.

624
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:37,170
So you've been to Madison House?

625
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:37,643
Where?

626
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:40,289
Madison House. Oh, amazing stuff,
lots of colonial.

627
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,559
It's not in my price range,
but I love to browse around.

628
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,552
I'll take you there right now.

629
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:47,242
Oh, uh, I don't know if now is a good time.

630
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:48,607
We have an appointment to keep.

631
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:51,328
An appointment? Huh, I thought you
were just walking around shopping.

632
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:55,781
We are. We made an appointment at an
appointments-only antique shop.

633
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:56,879
We have those here?

634
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,769
Obviously you do,
because we have an appointment at 1:00.

635
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,733
Well, I'll go with you.

636
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:01,992
They're only expecting two of us.

637
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:05,417
Well, they can squeeze in one more.
Promise I won't break anything.

638
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:06,422
Come on, take me there.

639
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:09,004
It's actually not for a while,
so we can't take you there now.

640
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:12,239
Perfect. Then we'll hit Madison House first.
It's just a 10-minute walk. Come on.

641
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,076
All right. Lead the way.

642
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:18,093
Cool. You know, I'd say let's drive,
but our streets-- forget about it.

643
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:18,920
What about the streets?

644
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:21,926
Oh, they're clogged night and day.
Yep, total gridlock.

645
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,675
It's not gonna help when they
build that big box store.

646
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:25,753
They're building a box store?

647
00:24:25,754 --> 00:24:27,310
Oh, yeah, right in the center of town.

648
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:28,226
Those things are hideous.

649
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:30,780
Yeah, it's gonna wipe out
all our local businesses.

650
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:33,042
This place will be a ghost town.
Ooh, hold your breath.

651
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:36,267
Oh, god, sorry. Sewer problems.

652
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,248
Your public-works department
needs to be notified.

653
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:40,613
No, they're on strike.
Well, they're always on strike.

654
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:41,789
Excuse me.

655
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,959
Allergies?

656
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,257
Meth lab.

657
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,106
We need our own bar.

658
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:05,146
You say it like I'm fighting.
I'm not fighting you.

659
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:05,885
Same here.

660
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:09,702
We need a public place where the next De
Kooning can run into the next Franz Kline

661
00:25:09,703 --> 00:25:14,221
and dis the next Jackson Pollock while the
next Charlie Parker shoots up in the corner.

662
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,343
So a nice family place.

663
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:18,491
I'm not kidding.
We'll call it "Cedar bar redux."

664
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:20,572
I would kick my own ass if we called it that.

665
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:23,891
Why don't we call it "Devoid of
original ideas poseur bar"?

666
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:25,815
Go to hell, both of you.

667
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,929
Hey, come back for a hug, man.

668
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,059
Hey, there's Alicia Matheson from the Weekly.

669
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,611
Whoa. Grab Matthew.
Get him off the bar thing.

670
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,485
Have him show her around.
That's what he does best.

671
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:36,099
Cedar bar redux.

672
00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:43,043
So my eyes don't deceive me.

673
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:44,849
First thing's first. What the hell is that?

674
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,206
It's an abstract painting.

675
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:47,833
But what is it supposed to be?

676
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:49,754
- Check the title.
- I did. It's called "untitled."

677
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:51,217
- There you go.
- I give up.

678
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:53,750
- So you got the invite.
- I got the invite.

679
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:54,917
I guess I didn't think you'd come.

680
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:56,537
- You guessed wrong, nephew.
- Cool.

681
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:57,472
So you want the tour?

682
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,364
Give me a tour.

683
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:00,652
All right, well, this is where we work,
Truncheon books.

684
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:04,853
There's usually desks and crap piled up
everywhere, but we cleaned up for today.

685
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,816
Those are the books that we put out.

686
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:08,835
We publish our zine once a month,

687
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:12,120
except last august,
when my partner forgot to pay the printer.

688
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:16,822
We let local artists hang their stuff up
without ripping them off on commissions.

689
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:20,351
We do performances over there,
and a few of us live upstairs.

690
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:23,010
That you don't want to see.
It's a disaster zone.

691
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,322
- This is yours, right?
- Yeah.

692
00:26:24,323 --> 00:26:25,895
I wanted to get it, but I couldn't find it.

693
00:26:25,896 --> 00:26:27,478
Yeah, it's not exactly "The Da Vinci Code."

694
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,789
Well, I will definitely get it today.

695
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:32,942
By the way, that is your cousin.

696
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:35,814
Right, Liz filled me in on all that, daddy.

697
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:37,225
She just calls me Luke.

698
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:38,558
Total brain.

699
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,725
You confirm paternity?

700
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:41,016
Don't be a wiseass.

701
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,022
Hey, April.

702
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:43,560
I want you to meet somebody.

703
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:47,418
Meet your cousin Jess. He's my sister's kid.

704
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:48,920
- Hi.
- Hey.

705
00:26:49,582 --> 00:26:51,035
Men in this family aren't chatty.

706
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:52,263
Sorry.

707
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:54,050
I'm gonna go explore a little more.

708
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:55,384
Cool.

709
00:26:55,942 --> 00:26:57,462
How are you adjusting to all that?

710
00:26:57,463 --> 00:27:00,608
Okay, I guess. I like her,
and she just sort of tolerates me.

711
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:01,415
Seems like it.

712
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,621
Thanks for the perspective.

713
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:03,625
That's why I'm here.

714
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:06,690
Hey, come on. I got some sculpture over
here you're really gonna hate.

715
00:27:08,223 --> 00:27:10,102
Ooh, that garbage smell.

716
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:12,005
- What garbage smell?
- I don't smell garbage.

717
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,090
Yeah, the wind shifted right after I said it.

718
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,726
Allowing a landfill within a
mile of city limits-- crazy.

719
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:17,858
It's within a mile?

720
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:19,783
Yeah, destroying everyone's land values.

721
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:20,987
Oh, well. Where did you park?

722
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:22,033
Over on Peach Street.

723
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:24,324
- Oh, you mean Carjack Lane?
- Carjack Lane?

724
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:26,456
Better than Chop Shop Alley. Here, follow me.

725
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:28,736
Oh, god, watch out for the pothole.

726
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:33,783
Ooh, I tell you. The roads are just the
things in between potholes in this town, huh?

727
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:34,415
Oh, dear.

728
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,642
You should talk to your mayor about
all these issues, Lorelai.

729
00:27:36,643 --> 00:27:37,599
You mean Gropey McGee?

730
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,424
I cannot, will not ever put myself
in that position again.

731
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,018
Mind if we stop by the store?

732
00:27:43,658 --> 00:27:46,759
Well, I'm running low on a lot of basics,
and I just want to see if they got them in.

733
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,112
This is a cute little store.

734
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:51,262
Well, if you can be cute and
unclean at the same time.

735
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:52,191
All right, let's see.

736
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,309
No. No.

737
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,173
No. Nope, and this is the only store in town.

738
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:58,176
What are you looking for?

739
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,254
What am I looking for? Everything.
They have nothing.

740
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:03,078
The little they have is off-brands,
which wouldn't be so galling,

741
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,069
except everything's so far
past its expiration date.

742
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,231
Hey, help yourself to some Little
George's chips. Yum, yum.

743
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:10,716
Little George-- pass.

744
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:13,562
Oh, and look.
Here we have some aunt Molly's ice cream.

745
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:16,027
You'll notice there's no picture
of aunt Molly on the carton.

746
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,621
I googled her and got a mug shot,

747
00:28:17,622 --> 00:28:20,531
and all I could think was, "I hope she hasn't
been selling that stuff to kids."

748
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,510
Excuse me. Lorelai, what are you doing?

749
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:23,507
Shopping, Taylor. Why?

750
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:25,578
You're walking around disparaging my store,

751
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,011
and not only is that insulting,
it's against the law.

752
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:28,865
Against the law?

753
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:33,904
Code 14/B/14 triple backslash X-8

754
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:37,765
state that a citizen of Stars Hollow
cannot denigrate Stars Hollow

755
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:40,625
while standing on Stars Hollow soil.

756
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:42,997
It was established in 1792.

757
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:45,767
The original penalty was death by 40 muskets.

758
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:47,259
Really, Taylor, you misheard me.

759
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,391
You made a crude joke about aunt Molly.

760
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:51,370
Well, you got to admit,
aunt Molly had it coming.

761
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:53,127
I don't joke about aunt Molly.

762
00:28:53,128 --> 00:28:54,300
Can you say BTK?

763
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:56,828
As town mayor, I could cite you on the spot.

764
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:58,838
This is Gropey McGee?

765
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,227
I beg your pardon.

766
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:02,292
Oh, look at the time. Excuse me all,
will you?

767
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:03,194
Mom, where you going?

768
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:04,888
I'm just going to get something
out of the car.

769
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:06,572
No, mom.
Mom, you don't know the safe streets.

770
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,473
You walk down the wrong one, you die.

771
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,645
Commence writing me up, Taylor.

772
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:14,688
Benzedrine and a muscled fist,

773
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:19,930
turn to hand, turn to handout, turned fish
and loaves and a lazy day in Galilee.

774
00:29:19,931 --> 00:29:23,087
Herman Melville, poet, customs officer,

775
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:27,511
rubber stamps,
and Hawthorne daydreams craving Tahiti

776
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:30,319
and simple sun and the light
of the Berkshires.

777
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,640
Is this any good?

778
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:33,504
I don't know what she's gonna write.

779
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:35,354
We're not supposed to know
what she's gonna write.

780
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:37,047
She's a member of the independent press.

781
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:40,018
She played it close to the vest, you know.
I hate that.

782
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:41,892
Go get a beer. Stop obsessing.

783
00:29:47,812 --> 00:29:50,045
Well, isn't this a day of surprises?

784
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:57,343
I didn't RSVP. Sorry.

785
00:29:57,344 --> 00:30:00,028
Ah, this isn't an RSVP type thing.

786
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,012
Showing up's cool.

787
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:01,902
Good thing.

788
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:03,382
So this is Truncheon books?

789
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,714
Yeah. This is Truncheon.

790
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:06,799
I like it.

791
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,452
It makes me feel like I want
to create something.

792
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:11,169
Give me a pen. Give me a brush.

793
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,131
That's Luke.

794
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:16,715
Yeah, there's a definite "Jess Mariano,
this is your life" vibe here today.

795
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:18,099
Hey, Luke.

796
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:19,626
- Bicycle?
- No.

797
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:20,921
Rory, hi. What are you doing here?

798
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:22,091
Same thing you're doing here.

799
00:30:22,092 --> 00:30:23,681
Your books are really easy to skim.

800
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:25,122
Thanks. That'll make a nice blurb.

801
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,746
I was gonna take off, actually.

802
00:30:26,747 --> 00:30:29,826
Uh, I got to get something.
Don't leave till I get back.
It'll just be a minute.

803
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,259
Okay.

804
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:33,273
You have a great face.

805
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:34,369
Thanks. So do you.

806
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,151
Yeah, uh, Rory, this is April.

807
00:30:37,152 --> 00:30:39,865
Oh, April. Hello there, April.

808
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,000
Hi.

809
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:42,155
The famous April.

810
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:42,909
I'm famous?

811
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,595
Kind of.

812
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:46,026
Uh, April, Rory's an old friend.

813
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:46,912
She doesn't look old.

814
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:50,616
I mean,
I've known her well since she was your age.

815
00:30:50,617 --> 00:30:51,725
She's from Stars Hollow.

816
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:56,044
She's actually the daughter of the woman
I'm with, my fiancé, Lorelai.

817
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:59,641
You met her that one time.
It's kind of complicated.

818
00:30:59,642 --> 00:31:00,362
I'll say...

819
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:02,414
You probably want to get back to
that boyfriend of yours, right?

820
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:04,841
He's not my boyfriend. Jeez.

821
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:06,829
Hey, Luke, come here.

822
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:08,988
Here.

823
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:12,105
Oh, let me-- let me buy this. That way,
you would get the money.

824
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:13,411
Ah, it's okay.

825
00:31:13,412 --> 00:31:14,355
What's this?

826
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:15,552
It's what's owed.

827
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:16,849
You owe me nothing.

828
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,115
I owe you.

829
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:21,566
Take it. If you rip it up,
I'm just gonna send another.

830
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:25,907
I'm very proud of you, of this,
of what you're going for here.

831
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:28,556
I don't get all of it, but I'm me.

832
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:29,594
Thanks.

833
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:35,555
All I said was that I liked him. I realized
it was a mistake as soon as I said it.

834
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:36,938
We should get going.

835
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:37,995
Nice meeting you.

836
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,093
Nice meeting you, too.
Good luck with everything.

837
00:31:40,094 --> 00:31:41,652
- Congratulations.
- Okay, thanks.

838
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:43,275
- See ya.
- Bye.

839
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:47,576
So you here alone?

840
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:48,964
I guess.

841
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:50,247
Cool.

842
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:51,799
Come on.

843
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:56,743
Oh, well, we'll be lucky to get a table.

844
00:31:56,744 --> 00:31:58,406
There's absolutely nowhere
else to eat in town,

845
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:01,589
and even being Luke's fiancé doesn't
guarantee me a meal when I want one.

846
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,124
Oh, great, more customers.

847
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,782
Well, there seem to be a
few tables available.

848
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,469
None of the good ones, unfortunately.

849
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,866
All right, you phoned mom,
you told her to meet us here.
What, is she late?

850
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:10,439
No, she's right there.

851
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:13,099
Oh, all right.
What is wrong with this picture?

852
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,820
They're playing cards.

853
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:15,708
Yeah, I can see that.
But who is that she's playing with?

854
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:17,897
I have no idea. Do they have ham here?

855
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:18,773
Ham? Sure.

856
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:21,421
Get me a ham and Swiss on rye, dry,
nothing on it.

857
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:23,548
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back in a bit.

858
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,376
Dad, wa-- dad.

859
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:29,343
Do you have any 8s?

860
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:30,259
Go fish.

861
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,672
Oh, you. I was sure you had 8s.

862
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:34,578
- Hi, Lorelai.
- Hi, mom. What you doing?

863
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:37,015
Oh, Sissy and I are playing go fish.
She's good, too.

864
00:32:37,016 --> 00:32:39,096
- It's your turn.
- Do you have any jacks?

865
00:32:39,147 --> 00:32:42,367
Unbelievable. She's won three games in a row.
She's a little champ.

866
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:44,503
- I keep getting lucky.
- It's not luck.

867
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,843
You said she was smart,
but this is something else.

868
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:48,459
- You get to go again.
- Oh, my God, mom?

869
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,844
Do you have any 3s?

870
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:51,675
Nope. Go fish.

871
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:53,325
Mom, who do you think this is?

872
00:32:53,326 --> 00:32:54,682
Luke's daughter.

873
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:57,114
Isn't it?

874
00:32:57,115 --> 00:32:57,901
No.

875
00:32:57,902 --> 00:32:59,276
You're not Luke's daughter?

876
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:01,886
I don't believe this.
This isn't Luke's daughter?

877
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:03,327
It's definitely not Luke's daughter.

878
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:05,207
And here I was bonding with it.

879
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,961
Who is this? Who are you?

880
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:08,939
Never mind, honey. Do you live close by?

881
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,726
Two blocks.

882
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:12,065
Okay. Why don't you go home where it's safe?

883
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:13,225
Okay.

884
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,181
You're telling me I played this
insipid game for a half an hour

885
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:18,385
and it's not even Luke's daughter?

886
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:19,731
What made you think it was Luke's daughter?

887
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:21,506
Well, it told me it was someone's
daughter here.

888
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:23,244
Well, she must have meant someone in town.

889
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:24,915
Well, then she's a moron.

890
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,450
Why would I play cards if there
wasn't a family connection?

891
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:29,170
I guess she just thought you were being nice.

892
00:33:29,171 --> 00:33:31,421
The little idiot kept tipping her
cards so I could see them.

893
00:33:31,422 --> 00:33:34,975
So I pretended I didn't and specifically
asked for what I knew she didn't have.

894
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,784
The kid's a moron.

895
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,139
Okay, mom. She's gone now.

896
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,308
Is it so stupid to think that
she's Luke's daughter?

897
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,406
She looks like Luke.

898
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,856
Mom, you can trust me that
there will be no contact

899
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:44,815
between you and Luke's daughter anytime soon.

900
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:45,621
What does that mean?

901
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:47,255
It means that I don't even see her.

902
00:33:47,256 --> 00:33:48,589
Luke and I have an arrangement.

903
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,754
What kind of arrangement?

904
00:33:49,755 --> 00:33:53,988
Well, he-- I mean, you know,
we mutually decided

905
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:56,282
that I probably shouldn't have
any contact with her.

906
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:58,039
What? That's ridiculous.

907
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,146
No, it is what it is. It's what we want.

908
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,493
Lorelai, you and Luke are in a relationship.

909
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:04,864
You're going to be husband and wife,
and Sissy's his daughter.

910
00:34:04,865 --> 00:34:06,864
No, no. That was Sissy.
April is his daughter.

911
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:09,758
You know what I mean. You have to have
a relationship with this girl.

912
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:10,781
It's imperative.

913
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,161
Mom, you don't know the whole story.

914
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:13,737
But I know your handiwork when I see it--

915
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:16,005
playing cautious when you
should be diving in.

916
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:19,330
That girl is his blood relation,
and you need to get to know her.

917
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:21,594
You'll be in her life for
the rest of your life.

918
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:22,872
Mom, it isn't just me.

919
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:25,058
I can't believe Luke is letting
you get away with this.

920
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,103
The sooner you embrace your
role in this girl's life,

921
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:29,337
the better off you'll be, mark my words.

922
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:30,185
Where's your father?

923
00:34:30,186 --> 00:34:31,717
He ran off to something.

924
00:34:31,718 --> 00:34:33,898
That's right. We had another appointment.
I'll find him.

925
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,322
Then we have to leave.
He needs to get back to work.

926
00:34:36,323 --> 00:34:37,184
All right, goodbye, mom.

927
00:34:37,185 --> 00:34:38,456
Goodbye.

928
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:42,250
You. You could have told me that
wasn't Luke's daughter.

929
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:44,013
I hate customers.

930
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:50,090
All I'm saying is, control your poet.

931
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:51,642
So suddenly he's my poet.

932
00:34:51,643 --> 00:34:52,982
He changed up on us.

933
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:55,199
He wasn't supposed to premiere
new material tonight.

934
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,008
It wasn't bad.

935
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:57,704
- It was rambling.
- It was a little rambling.

936
00:34:57,705 --> 00:35:00,328
And what was that whole part
about desiring Golda Meir?

937
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:02,891
Please tell me that was symbolic.

938
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:04,421
I'll talk to my poet.

939
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:09,701
Hey, we're hitting that bar that we're
not going to call "Cedar bar redux."

940
00:35:09,702 --> 00:35:10,375
You coming?

941
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,039
Yeah, maybe.

942
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,110
You know, go on ahead. I'll catch up.

943
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,888
You know, you don't have to read it again.

944
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:27,198
I know I don't.

945
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,125
God, there are so many things
I would change in it.

946
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:29,887
Like what?

947
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:33,676
I'd keep the back cover.
Everything else goes.

948
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:35,411
- You know why I love your book?
- Why?

949
00:35:35,412 --> 00:35:37,428
It doesn't remind me of anything.

950
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:38,832
It's not a rip-off. It's just you.

951
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,041
High praise, Miss Yale editor.

952
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:43,526
Yeah, well,
I don't get to write as much as I would like.

953
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:48,324
I am mostly assigning and motivating,
hand-holding, and rewriting.

954
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:51,067
Yeah, and you love it, every minute of it.
Come on, tell me you don't.

955
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:54,405
I do. I do love it. It's exciting.

956
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:56,857
Yeah, you look happier than
when I saw you last.

957
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:58,216
I am.

958
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,361
So you fixed everything?

959
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:03,753
Yeah, everything's fixed.

960
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,548
I'm glad you're here.

961
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:08,548
Yeah, me too.

962
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:19,854
What?

963
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:20,974
I'm sorry.

964
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:22,057
About what?

965
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:25,809
Uh, about coming here like this.

966
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,531
I just got the flier, and I don't know.

967
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:30,651
I just wanted to see your place,
but then this...

968
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:32,708
it's not fair to you. I'm such a jerk.

969
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:34,565
I don't know what you're talking about.

970
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:36,661
And I couldn't even cheat on him
the way he cheated on me.

971
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,576
Who? Who cheated on y--

972
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:40,441
That guy?

973
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,132
You're still with him.

974
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,498
Yeah.

975
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,336
I thought everything was fixed.

976
00:36:50,337 --> 00:36:51,664
Everything but him.

977
00:36:51,665 --> 00:36:52,705
I hate this.

978
00:36:52,706 --> 00:36:54,036
You should. I'm sorry.

979
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:57,329
You came here alone to Philadelphia.

980
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:58,748
He was out of town.

981
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,143
I don't deserve this, Rory.

982
00:37:00,144 --> 00:37:03,424
No, you don't. You don't deserve it.
I just...

983
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:05,944
I'm in love with him.

984
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:10,614
Despite all the bad he's done,
I can't help it. I'm in love with him.

985
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:13,191
Love, huh?

986
00:37:13,392 --> 00:37:14,885
Yeah.

987
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:22,164
I guess I'll call Matthew's poet
and have him explain love to me.

988
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:24,041
Poets know all about it, right?

989
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,691
They're supposed to.

990
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:29,834
Well, I guess I better go.

991
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:31,294
Okay.

992
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:33,483
I'm so sorry that I came here.

993
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,843
I'm not.

994
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,944
It's what it is-- you, me.

995
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:40,637
Where did you park?

996
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:42,364
I'm right outside.

997
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:49,348
Hey, if, uh, if it makes you feel better,

998
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:52,598
you can always tell him
that we did something.

999
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:54,328
Thanks, Jess.

1000
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:01,202
You know what I thought?
I thought an apple stop would be fun today.

1001
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:02,135
Oh, great idea.

1002
00:38:02,136 --> 00:38:03,849
The banana stop was a big hit yesterday.

1003
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,524
I don't see how an apple stop could fail.

1004
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:07,245
Yeah, they loved the banana stop.

1005
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,533
I have pamphlets for the kids
to read about Amish country.

1006
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:10,493
Should we hand them out now?

1007
00:38:10,494 --> 00:38:11,633
I think that's a good idea.

1008
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:13,770
Oh, I'll do it.
I've got something for April here,

1009
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,608
so I was about to sneak back there anyway.

1010
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:17,078
Thank you, Luke.

1011
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,593
Hey, everybody. Sorry to interrupt.

1012
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:23,208
I got some pamphlets here,
a little info on Amish country.

1013
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:26,348
It's got some pictures,
but we're gonna see it,
so you don't have to look at the pictures.

1014
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:29,911
It's got stuff to read, too.
So go ahead and pass the rest around there.

1015
00:38:29,912 --> 00:38:31,579
I thought you might need your sweater.

1016
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:34,120
Okay, then.

1017
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:35,701
See ya.

1018
00:38:35,702 --> 00:38:37,673
My dad's ridiculously overprotective.

1019
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:39,379
Ridiculously.
