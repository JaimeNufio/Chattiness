1
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:28,341
Founder's Day punch?

2
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:29,758
Abba Zabbas.

3
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:32,456
Good morning Vietnam!

4
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,946
How's everyone feeling today?

5
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:37,925
Terrific! Okay, I got tacos, hard tacos,

6
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:40,255
I got soft tacos, I got fries,

7
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:42,317
curly, straight, and spicy -

8
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:43,208
Are you serious?

9
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,599
Trust me. It's the best hangover food on the east coast.

10
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,706
You get a Mars bar?

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,820
You know, hare to the dog?

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,530
Ah, there's pop tarts in the cabinet, Kirk.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,570
Coffee'll be up in a minute, grab some water and start hydrating!

14
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:54,390
The smell of these tacos is making me nauseous.

15
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:57,008
No, no, no. That's the quart of Patty's non-FDA-approved

16
00:00:57,053 --> 00:00:59,285
Founder's Day punch you drank last night. Eat a taco.

17
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:01,317
Oh, thank God, hangover food.

18
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:02,895
That's my little college girl.

19
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:04,215
Tito's was open this early?

20
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,307
Well, it was for me.

21
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:08,625
The power you have over fast food owners is astonishing.

22
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:11,286
Oh, God. I think I'm going to throw up.

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,929
No. I'm good.

24
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,995
By the way, thanks for leaving me on the bathroom floor all night.

25
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:20,099
Uh, hey, I tried to get you up. You actually used your foot to stop me.

26
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:20,591
I did?

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,133
Yes. It was very House of Flying Daggers, but with vomiting.

28
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,101
Sorry. I don't remember that.

29
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:27,487
The foot part. The vomiting part, however -

30
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:28,741
Stop saying the word 'vomiting'.

31
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,251
Unless you want a Mr. Creosote situation on your hands here.

32
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:39,534
Oh, man. I think I got a cavity.

33
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,775
I got to stop partying like this.

34
00:01:45,074 --> 00:01:45,862
What are you looking for?

35
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:46,707
My book bag.

36
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:47,603
I believe it's in your room.

37
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,303
Room?

38
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,692
- That way.
- Right.

39
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,696
Hey.

40
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:53,598
I got you a beef burrito.

41
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:57,296
I thought it might be too hardcore for the amateurs in the kitchen,

42
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:58,540
but I figured you'd appreciate it.

43
00:01:58,595 --> 00:01:59,252
Thanks.

44
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:02,099
So, how are you feeling?

45
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:02,923
I've been better.

46
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:04,084
Yeah. You take aspirin?

47
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:05,770
- Aspirin?
- White pill, big 'A' on it.

48
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:06,632
Right, yep.

49
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:10,629
Oh, here, before I forget. Um, this fell out of your pocket last night

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
while you were pulling an Exorcist.

51
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:14,541
Mm. Paris gave it to me to hold so she wouldn't call Doyle.

52
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:15,974
She was the talk of the town this morning.

53
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,625
Attacked the pretzel cart, police backup had to be called for the first time ever.

54
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:21,043
She was quite a mess.

55
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:23,096
So apparently it was a theme.

56
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:25,424
I am sorry. It won't happen again, believe me.

57
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:28,257
You, of all people, should know the dangers of the Founder's Day punch.

58
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,244
Did you learn nothing from Mommy's Coyote Ugly bar dance

59
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:31,831
at last year's Salute to the Quakers festival?

60
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:33,955
Oh, now, you can't blame that all on the punch.

61
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:37,477
Well, don't get me wrong, I'm always up for a little mother-daughter bonding, but seriously.

62
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:38,918
When did facials go out of style?

63
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:39,838
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:41,268
I just don't like seeing you like that.

65
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:42,548
That makes two of us.

66
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,377
So, what was all that stuff you were babbling on about last night?

67
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,089
What stuff?

68
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:47,950
About Logan.

69
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:50,305
Things aren't going so well with the two of you, huh?

70
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,297
I'm going to get some coffee.

71
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:53,173
Rory.

72
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,528
I know. Kitchen, that way.

73
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:09,189
Well, this is a surprise.

74
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:10,567
Can I come in?

75
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:11,872
Sure. You want to sit down?

76
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:14,011
Nope. Got to stay vertical.

77
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,843
What?

78
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,672
You have, like, an octagon imprinted on your face.

79
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,793
I can't do this anymore Logan.

80
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,708
Do what?

81
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,277
This casual dating thing. I don't like it.

82
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,336
It's not who I am and I don't want to make it who I am.

83
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:28,334
Whoa, hold on here. Where's this coming from?

84
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:31,196
It's coming from me. The ravishing creature standing in front of you.

85
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,039
We talked about this.

86
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:33,980
I know.

87
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:35,138
I didn't make you do this.

88
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,554
I know. I'm not accusing you of anything.

89
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:38,512
This isn't your fault.

90
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,442
I don't understand. I thought everything was going so well.

91
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:42,351
What are you talking about? I haven't heard from you in a week.

92
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:44,215
I was busy. I had some friends in town, and -

93
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:45,270
You know what? It doesn't matter.

94
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:47,693
You're not my boyfriend, you don't owe me any explanations.

95
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:50,380
I just don't want to be one of the many anymore.

96
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:51,521
Oh, Rory, come on!

97
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:54,132
Hey, Logan, Cassandra's on the phone.

98
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:54,932
Take a message.

99
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:56,677
She's got a great accent. Where's she from?

100
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:57,820
Lanny! Message!

101
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,949
Fine. Relax, man. Geez.

102
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,612
Go call Cassandra back. We're done here.

103
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:03,646
How are we done here?

104
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:05,678
I said everything I have to say.

105
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:06,524
Which is what?

106
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:10,512
I'm a girlfriend girl, Logan. I have boyfriends, not escorts.

107
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:11,300
Ah.

108
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:14,429
I thought I could be different, but I can't. I'm sorry.

109
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:16,630
Maybe we can just go back to being friends again.

110
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,022
Or maybe we can become boyfriend and girlfriend, right?

111
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:19,506
What?

112
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,721
I get it. I get what you're doing.

113
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:21,986
I'm not doing anything.

114
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,789
Hey, if that's what you want then just come out and say it.

115
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:25,606
But you coming in here and issuing an ultimatum -

116
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,393
I am not issuing an ultimatum!

117
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:28,145
That's not what I heard.

118
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:29,507
I said let's be friends!

119
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:30,485
That's not what you meant!

120
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,955
I need a taco!

121
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:36,594
All right, fine. I'll do it.

122
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:37,551
Do what?

123
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:38,477
I'll be your boyfriend.

124
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:39,793
You can't be my boyfriend.

125
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,449
Why not?

126
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:42,620
Because you told me that you can't be my boyfriend.

127
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:43,894
If I say I can, then I can.

128
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,727
You have a hundred girls on speed dial.

129
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:48,512
You keep a second bathrobe in your closet for overnight guests.

130
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:51,621
That's all beside the point. You came in here to say you were unhappy with the situation, right?

131
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:52,091
Right.

132
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:54,109
Fine. I've rectified the situation. Problem solved.

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,342
No. Problem not solved.

134
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,862
Hey. If I say I can do this, I can do this!

135
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:03,658
Hey Logan. Thought maybe I could get you to buy me some lunch.

136
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:04,348
Oh, geez -

137
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,151
I'm sorry. Could you excuse us for just a second? We're almost done here.

138
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:08,778
Sure. I'll just wait out here.

139
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:14,230
So the Swedish flight attendants should be here any minute.

140
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:16,797
I swear this situation has never happened to me before in my life.

141
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:17,754
- Logan -
- Rory.

142
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:19,637
Do you really want to stop seeing me?

143
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:20,692
No, but I can't -

144
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,510
'Cause I don't want to stop seeing you.

145
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,870
Okay, but -

146
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,800
So then just accept what I'm saying.

147
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,910
I like trying new things. It's new, it's different, but I can do it.

148
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:30,215
Are you sure?

149
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:36,079
Well, I know you can do that, but -

150
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,609
I really want to believe you.

151
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:46,406
Then believe me. We're starting fresh right now, new beginning.

152
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,051
So you want to go grab some lunch? We'll hammer out the details.

153
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,248
I should probably change first.

154
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:54,090
Go home, change. I'll pick you up in half an hour.

155
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:55,775
Okay.

156
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:01,592
See how good this is going so far? I think I'm going to be an excellent boyfriend.

157
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:03,741
I agree. Now do you want to go tell her, or should I?

158
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,109
Oh, crap. I'll be right back.

159
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,360
Doyle?

160
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:22,195
Hey.

161
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:24,011
What are you doing here?

162
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,610
I'm dying.

163
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,893
What do you mean, you're dying?

164
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:29,194
I got sick.

165
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,187
And then my very concerned roommates kicked me out because they have exams.

166
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:33,986
Oh my God.

167
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,778
I didn't know where to go, so I came here.

168
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:37,248
I called you first.

169
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:39,543
- I was gone this weekend.
- So I just came by.

170
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,393
I thought I'd wait till you got back, then I fell asleep.

171
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,632
You've been here all weekend?

172
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:45,984
I thought you were avoiding me.

173
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,503
I'm sorry you're sick.

174
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,382
It feels like bees are buzzing in my head.

175
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:54,229
- Feel it.
- What?

176
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:55,721
- Feel my head.
- Why?

177
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,712
I just want you to know how hot I am.

178
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:00,079
Well, when you're hot, you're hot and when you're not, you're not.

179
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,034
That's how the song goes. Just follow the song.

180
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:02,786
What?

181
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:04,999
I just don't see what putting my hand on your head is going to get you.

182
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:05,509
It's just -

183
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:07,626
I'm not a shaman, Doyle. I don't have healing powers.

184
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:09,228
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

185
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,111
Hold on a second.

186
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:15,259
It's for you. It's Sookie. She's done with her doctor's appointment.

187
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:16,289
Oh, she say how she is?

188
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,802
Mm, to someone who may have asked her, I'm sure she would have.

189
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:19,980
Mm-hm. Hey, Sookie.

190
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:21,450
The bastard put me on bed rest.

191
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:21,890
What?

192
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:24,394
Dr. Menck. He told me to lie down immediately

193
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:27,674
and not to get up again until little Cherry or Norric comes out.

194
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:29,831
Oh. Well, we'll get to the names in a second.

195
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:32,600
So, are you serious about the bed rest? Where are you?

196
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,061
I'm at home, on the couch!

197
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:34,813
Are you okay?

198
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:36,774
No, I'm not okay! I have a dinner to get out.

199
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,949
Well, honey, I think we're going to have to do that without you.

200
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:39,876
But how?

201
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,671
Well, we have a kitchen staff, and you just tell me what still needs to be done, and we will handle it.

202
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:44,981
Okay. Get a pencil.

203
00:08:45,063 --> 00:08:46,460
Okay. Pencil in hand.

204
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,586
You need to grate six carrots and four parsnips,

205
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:51,299
and then take some flour and butter, melt the butter, make a roux.

206
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:52,897
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

207
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:53,649
What?

208
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,677
Uh, baby, you lost me at carrots.

209
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:58,278
Which, uh, by the way, was the first draft of 'you had me at hello'.

210
00:08:58,349 --> 00:08:59,973
You had me at what? What are you talking about?

211
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:02,308
Oh, sorry. I see we've entered the no humor zone.

212
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:04,642
Look, just relax. I'm going to take care of everything.

213
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:05,548
But the ducks.

214
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,293
The ducks will be fine. They're lying in a pan with their heads chopped off,

215
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:09,650
so the worst part is behind them.

216
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:12,599
Now, don't worry. Go rest, and I'll check in with you later.

217
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,100
- But -
- Happy hibernating!

218
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:16,341
No Sookie?

219
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:17,627
No Sookie. Come on.

220
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:22,204
Okay, now tell me who does what, and what we need to keep things running.

221
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,591
Well, we need Sookie here.

222
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:25,752
Okay. Well, she's not going to be here, so let's go to plan B.

223
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,244
Okay, plan B. That involves Sookie's clone, also named Sookie.

224
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:31,363
Well, um, who here makes the sauces?

225
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:32,060
Sookie.

226
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,386
Who here, Michel?

227
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:36,294
Sookie trusts no one else with the sauces. She makes the sauces.

228
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:37,436
Well, what does Mark make?

229
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:38,194
Salads.

230
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,519
Okay, and Donny does desserts. What do our other guys do?

231
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,403
Well, that man over there does the cleaning.

232
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:44,446
That man over there dresses the plates,

233
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,591
that man uses tongs, and

234
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:49,418
I have no idea what that man in the corner does.

235
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,433
But I would check his trunk before he leaves.

236
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,523
Without Sookie here, we have salads and desserts?

237
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:54,266
Pretty much.

238
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:57,112
We can't run a restaurant serving just salads and desserts!

239
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:58,776
I would not go to eat, no.

240
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:01,480
Wait, okay. Here we have duck. Um, who here does the duck?

241
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:03,938
Nobody touches the ducks.

242
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,636
Well, starting now, someone has to touch the ducks!

243
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:09,324
I do not know what to tell you, except that it will not be me.

244
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:10,578
This is bad, Michel.

245
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:11,904
I'm getting that, yes.

246
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:14,397
Well, we'll just figure something out, right?

247
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:18,346
Absolutely. Ain't no mountain high enough.

248
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,478
We'll just, um, formulate a plan, nail down a strategy.

249
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:22,728
You have any ideas?

250
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,636
We could order some pizza, or Chinese food,

251
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:28,458
or perhaps one of those hoagies that you cut into a million pieces -

252
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:30,198
No more suggestions necessary, Michel.

253
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:31,924
Well, I'm here if you need me.

254
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:36,982
Luke's!

255
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:38,109
How pretty do you think I am?

256
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,167
Are we using a specific day?

257
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,534
Have you had a good night's sleep?

258
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:44,170
Sookie's doctor put her on immediate bed rest, and I thought it would be fine,

259
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,496
but no one will touch the ducks, and Michel wants to order a hoagie,

260
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:49,274
and I am starting to hyperventilate and I'm not wearing a stretchy fabric, and -

261
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,258
I'll be right there.

262
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,041
How's that headache of yours?

263
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:53,224
Subsiding a little.

264
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,586
The mashed potato, mac and cheese, biscuit, gravy plate combo really helped a lot.

265
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,997
I have to say, half the fun in being with you is the horrified looks on the waiters' faces.

266
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,209
Please. I'm an amateur compared to my mother.

267
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,304
So what do you think? You up for a movie?

268
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:04,897
Oh, yeah. Something really bad.

269
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:07,497
Absolutely. Let's check the paper and see if Rob Schneider's still employable.

270
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,925
I think I have a paper over -

271
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,408
Well! Look how long you make a girl wait for you!

272
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:13,210
Honor!

273
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:14,260
Do you really think you're worth it?

274
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:15,254
What are you doing here?

275
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,337
Apparently begging for some affection!

276
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:20,667
It is so good to see you.

277
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,378
You too!

278
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:23,170
Listen, Logan. Maybe I should go.

279
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:24,117
What?

280
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:27,154
Oh, sorry, God. Rory, this is my sister Honor. Honor, Rory Gilmore.

281
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,562
Sister? Really?

282
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,762
Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you.

283
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:31,792
It's nice to meet you too.

284
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,184
Hey, your sister's here. Cool.

285
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:34,312
So, what's the occasion?

286
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:36,875
Well, I had to see you, and since you never check your email

287
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:39,448
I had to drag myself down and beg Lanny to let me in

288
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:40,916
so I could show you this!

289
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,262
Holy!

290
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:44,240
It happened last night!

291
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:45,741
Oh, Josh finally gave in, uh?

292
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,110
Oh, stop it. He's lucky I ever looked at him in the first place.

293
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:49,202
Well, congratulations.

294
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:50,737
Listen. I need a favor.

295
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:54,765
I'm going to tell them tomorrow night at dinner and I need you there for support.

296
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:55,928
- Come on.
- Hey.

297
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,104
I backed you up when you wanted to take a year off school and sail around the world.

298
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:01,335
I wired you the money when you sunk the yacht.

299
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,107
I helped pay off the Indonesian Coast Guard!

300
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,643
Okay, okay! I'll be there.

301
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,199
Oh, thank you! I love you, I love you, I love you.

302
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:11,473
Okay. Now I can breathe. And focus on - you.

303
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:12,939
- Hi.
- Hi.

304
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,077
Okay, I'm totally blanking. Your name is?

305
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:16,491
Rory. Rory Gilmore.

306
00:12:16,556 --> 00:12:17,627
Yeah, Rory's my...

307
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:19,546
girlfriend.

308
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,341
You okay over there?

309
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,361
You need a little water, or a time machine?

310
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,459
I'm sorry, did you say girlfriend?

311
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:30,145
Yes.

312
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:30,904
It's new.

313
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,347
Oh, my God!

314
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:35,082
I've never heard him call anyone his girlfriend before.

315
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:38,439
Well, Alyssa Milano, but he was ten and in a weird Who's the Boss phase.

316
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:41,149
Oh, wow, time flies when you're getting pushed out the door.

317
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,457
Okay, I'm sorry. Listen, you must come to dinner too.

318
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:44,313
Oh, um -

319
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:46,274
No. Really, come. Please come.

320
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:48,092
It'll make it more festive and distracting.

321
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:48,870
We'll see.

322
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:51,200
Okay, fine. I have to go.

323
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:53,576
I'll see you tomorrow night. Please don't be late?

324
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:54,338
I promise.

325
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:57,687
- Bye, Rory.
- Bye!

326
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,569
And that is my sister.

327
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:01,911
I like her!

328
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:03,022
Yeah, she's cool!

329
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:05,208
Listen, you do not have to take me to dinner tomorrow.

330
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:06,877
It's a family thing, I totally understand.

331
00:13:06,964 --> 00:13:07,865
No, you should come.

332
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:08,454
Logan.

333
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,270
Hey. Boyfriends bring their girlfriends to their family's houses for dinner.

334
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:12,053
It's natural.

335
00:13:12,284 --> 00:13:13,067
How would you know?

336
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,613
I saw it on Who's the Boss.

337
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,180
Now, let's find that paper.

338
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:25,698
So, there's the fridge, stove's over there, grill's on the side, freezer's in the back.

339
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:28,596
That's salad man, plate guy, tongs guy, check-his-trunk-before-he-leaves guy,

340
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:30,363
and here are the ducks. Are you familiar with ducks?

341
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:31,341
I am familiar with ducks.

342
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:33,337
But, I mean, not just familiar, like you know what a duck is.

343
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:34,443
I mean, have you cooked a duck before?

344
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:35,641
I can handle the ducks. Relax.

345
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:36,844
Okay. Ducks handled. Good.

346
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:39,520
Now, does Sookie have a menu notes, or, uh -

347
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:41,198
Oh, thanks, uh -

348
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:42,072
Me llamo Manny.

349
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,055
Manny. Gracias, Manny.

350
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:46,409
I talked to Sookie, she said everything you need is in that folder, it's a little unorganized.

351
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,631
Well, it wouldn't be Sookie's fault if it wasn't a little unorganized.

352
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,223
Okay, so what can I do to help?

353
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:50,802
Nothing.

354
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,097
Ah. Perfect answer.

355
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:53,870
Not without a hairnet.

356
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:55,539
Okay. I'll be out there if you need me.

357
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:57,888
He's right there.

358
00:13:58,492 --> 00:13:59,711
What's going on?

359
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:00,638
I'm taking care of you.

360
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:01,662
You're -

361
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:02,823
Hey!

362
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,558
This is Nanny. She only speaks Portuguese.

363
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:08,770
What's Portuguese for 'Ow, you're ripping my chest hair out'?

364
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:11,774
Clean shirt. Got it.

365
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,593
What's she doing?

366
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:13,822
What's that jar?

367
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,237
She's got salve! She's got salve!

368
00:14:17,903 --> 00:14:20,124
Doyle, relax. Nanny took care of me for years.

369
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:20,954
Oh, God.

370
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:24,149
Do you remember when Han Solo finds Luke Skywalker in the snowstorm

371
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:26,530
and he cuts open their dead Taun-taun to hide inside?

372
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,456
That's what I smell like at this moment.

373
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,483
She makes that balm herself. I'm telling you, it's magic.

374
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:33,040
Paris, no offense to Nanny and her magic healing balm,

375
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,801
but when I came over here I thought you would take care of me.

376
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:37,456
I am taking care of you. I brought you Nanny.

377
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:39,249
I don't want Nanny. I'm scared of Nanny.

378
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,646
Can't you just take it from here?

379
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:41,173
No.

380
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:41,875
Why?

381
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,216
Sick people freak me out.

382
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:44,363
You're pre-med!

383
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:47,112
Paris -

384
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:49,006
Lie down! You'll feel better soon, I promise!

385
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:54,434
Cocina.

386
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,827
Sí, aquí esta.

387
00:14:55,923 --> 00:14:57,255
Luke, Sookie.

388
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,817
Hey, Sookie.

389
00:14:58,924 --> 00:14:59,564
Hi.

390
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:00,363
Hi.

391
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:01,381
Whatcha doing?

392
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:02,313
I'm cooking.

393
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,413
Right, good. Little test.

394
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:08,585
So, I was just checking in, making sure everything was fine.

395
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,162
Everything is fine.

396
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:11,664
The ducks working out for you?

397
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:13,276
The ducks are selling like hotcakes.

398
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:15,682
Like hotcakes.

399
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,613
God, you are a funny guy!

400
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:19,553
I just, I never realized.

401
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:25,821
So, I just wanted to tell you that I'm really grateful to you for jumping in like this.

402
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:26,819
Happy to jump.

403
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:28,001
Are you straining the sauce?

404
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:28,672
Excuse me?

405
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:30,035
The duck sauce. Are you straining it?

406
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:30,633
Yes.

407
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:31,176
Twice?

408
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:31,728
No.

409
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:34,837
Oh, well. It's really best if you strain it twice.

410
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,241
It makes it really smooth.

411
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,960
People seem to be liking the sauce, Sookie.

412
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,919
Well, sure, when you don't know what you're missing, then -

413
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:43,663
Okay, tell you what. From now on, I will strain the duck sauce twice.

414
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:45,122
Three times, if it'll make you happy.

415
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,858
No! Then it'll be too runny!

416
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,836
Twice it is.

417
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:48,621
Thank you.

418
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:49,347
You're welcome.

419
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:51,661
Hey. I've got Sookie on the phone, do you need to talk to her?

420
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:52,614
Yes, actually. Great.

421
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,828
I'm handing you over to Lorelai.

422
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,290
Hey.

423
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:57,794
He's not straining the duck sauce three times, is he?

424
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,693
Uh, not to my knowledge. Hey, Sookie, where are the applications?

425
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:04,026
I don't know why you'd joke about a thing like that. Three times! That's not funny!

426
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,676
Sookie, the applications, from the culinary institute, for your temporary replacement?

427
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,187
Are they not there?

428
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,487
Uh, depends on where 'there' is.

429
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:12,684
Huh. They're around somewhere.

430
00:16:12,832 --> 00:16:15,490
Check the freezer. Sometimes I like to read in there.

431
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:16,617
That's very Lucy of you.

432
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:18,782
I'll call when I find them. Now rest. Bye.

433
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:19,457
Bye.

434
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:22,468
You know, I love watching you cook. It's hot.

435
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:23,866
That's because you're standing right next to the broiler.

436
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,146
Oh, is that what we're calling it now?

437
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:26,723
Not in front of the guys, please.

438
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:28,551
Fine. I'll save my dirty cooking jokes for later.

439
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:33,124
Yeah, I was just wondering if I could get you to re-submit those applications.

440
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:35,596
Well, we seem to have misplaced them.

441
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,459
As soon as possible would be great.

442
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:42,534
Uh-huh. You can just fax them over. Thanks. Bye.

443
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:46,307
Hello, is somebody there?

444
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,720
Hey, Mom!

445
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,322
Hey, Mom? That's it?

446
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:52,758
You just gave me a heart attack and all you have to say is 'hey, Mom'?

447
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:54,054
I thought you were a vicious serial killer.

448
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:55,957
Who you were going to challenge to a pillow fight?

449
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:57,484
What are you doing here, Sassy McSassterson?

450
00:16:57,536 --> 00:16:58,606
I needed some stuff.

451
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,393
What stuff?

452
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:00,253
My blue dress.

453
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,524
What do you need your blue dress for?

454
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,325
Okay. I am going to tell you something.

455
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:06,537
But when I do, you cannot say a word.

456
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,207
Why not?

457
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:08,448
Because I don't want to hear it.

458
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:08,958
Hear what?

459
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:09,743
What you're going to say.

460
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:10,781
But how do you know what I'm going to say?

461
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:11,852
Trust me. I know.

462
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:14,350
Hey, I have been known to say some very surprising things.

463
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:17,842
'Hugh, I know you're with Elizabeth Hurley, but how about picking up a hooker tonight?'

464
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:18,601
That was me.

465
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:19,219
Mom!

466
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:20,217
Okay, fine.

467
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,866
Logan and I are now boyfriend and girlfriend.

468
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:28,804
And I am here because I need my blue dress.

469
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,673
To wear to his parents' house tonight.

470
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,582
I went over to Logan's apartment yesterday.

471
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:45,581
I told him that I didn't want to do the casual dating thing anymore.

472
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:47,610
That it wasn't me, and we should just go back to being friends.

473
00:17:47,662 --> 00:17:48,967
Instead, he decided to commit.

474
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:50,302
Not a word.

475
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:53,666
Now I know that things may have started off a little rocky -

476
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:59,463
But I am very happy with the way things are going and I think that, in time, you will be too.

477
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:03,887
Okay, I have everything I need. I have to get going. Logan's picking me up at six.

478
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,986
It was nice talking to you. Don't forget to breathe.

479
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:13,226
Good, add the parsley and get it out there.

480
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:14,435
Kitchen!

481
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,975
Do you put walnuts in your béchamel?

482
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,229
Sookie?

483
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,774
Do you put walnuts in your béchamel?

484
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:20,439
No.

485
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,693
You don’t put walnuts in your béchamel.

486
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:24,934
Sookie, I have things burning, so –

487
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:26,533
I thought I tasted walnuts.

488
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,603
What things are you burning?

489
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,240
What do you mean, you tasted walnuts?

490
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:32,522
You want to get fancy, you can do that at your own diner.

491
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:34,146
My béchamel sauce is classic.

492
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:35,559
How are you tasting the béchamel?

493
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:38,918
And I don’t remember including goat cheese in the fennel salad!

494
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,259
How do you know what’s in the fennel salad?

495
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:41,284
So you admit it.

496
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:43,643
You put goat cheese in the fennel salad.

497
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,213
Yeah, I put goat cheese in the fennel salad.

498
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:47,244
It goes good in the fennel salad and you had it sitting there.

499
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:49,158
And I also have some Brill-o pads sitting there.

500
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:52,687
You want to toss a couple of those into the fennel salad as well? Hm?

501
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:54,206
How do you know all this?

502
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:55,508
I just assumed.

503
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:57,571
You just assumed I put goat cheese in the fennel salad.

504
00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:59,200
And walnuts in the béchamel.

505
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:01,000
I did not put walnuts in the -

506
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:06,075
Sookie, are you having people bring you my food?

507
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:10,269
You are! You’re calling here and having people sneak food out from behind my back

508
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:11,979
so that you can taste it.

509
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:14,202
Wow. You paranoid or what?

510
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,141
Geez, man, time for a vacation.

511
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:18,568
Hold on.

512
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:21,778
Okay, here’s the deal. Announcement, please.

513
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,090
From this moment on there will be no more food leaving the premises.

514
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:29,781
The food goes from here to the dining room, or upstairs, and that is it.

515
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:32,397
No more food will leave the premises.

516
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:35,961
No quiero que ninguna comida salga de esta local. ¿Comprende?

517
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:37,686
What about you, you comprende?

518
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,192
That’s my kitchen, Luke!

519
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:40,902
And it will be here waiting for you when you get back.

520
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:44,650
Until then, sit back, relax, and watch Ellen dance around a little. I got work to do.

521
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:45,643
- Luke!
- Bye-bye.

522
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:49,949
- Hey, Paris.
- Hey, Rory.

523
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:57,352
Oh!

524
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:58,991
Oh, I scare?

525
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,691
No. Yes!

526
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:01,930
Excuse me.

527
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,032
There’s a woman in my room?

528
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:06,666
That’s Nanny. You know Nanny.

529
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,584
That makes me sad, that you don’t remember Nanny. She always liked you.

530
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:12,022
She’s stripping my bed. Why is she doing that?

531
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:14,648
Well, she finally got Doyle to sleep, and she has to do something.

532
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,148
The woman doesn’t tire. She’s a machine.

533
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,932
What do you mean, she finally got Doyle to sleep?

534
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:20,183
He’s here. He’s sick, so Nanny’s taking care of him.

535
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:20,986
Why aren’t you doing it?

536
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:21,877
Sick people freak me out.

537
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:22,892
You’re pre-med!

538
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:24,930
I’m really tired of having that constantly thrown in my face.

539
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:27,007
Paris, could you please just get Nanny out of my room,

540
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,902
‘cause I have dinner with Logan tonight and I have to get ready.

541
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:30,371
Logan? I thought you guys were –

542
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,160
We were.

543
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:32,081
What happened?

544
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:34,713
Well, I told him that I didn’t think things were working

545
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:37,453
and that we should just be friends, but he didn’t want to be just –

546
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,224
- Friends?
- No. It seemed to wake him up.

547
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,745
So now he wants to give commitment a try.

548
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,091
A commitment? With Logan?

549
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:42,582
Yep.

550
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:45,317
I don’t believe it! You did it, you landed the whale. You’re Annette Bening.

551
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,198
I’m not Annette Bening.

552
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:49,357
It was just a matter of getting him to focus on the situation.

553
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,916
Focus. Huh.

554
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,707
She’s going to buff your shoes.

555
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:55,541
I need these.

556
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,835
My God, my room is clean!

557
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:09,647
Wow!

558
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:11,629
Uh, where are my keys? What did I do with my keys?

559
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,647
Just your parents live here?

560
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,574
Ah, got ‘em.

561
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:18,259
Well, I certainly hope the drainage is good.

562
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:19,140
Excuse me?

563
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:21,413
Because if it’s not good and you have pooling somewhere,

564
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,561
you may not know it for months.

565
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,932
I’ll be sure to mention that to them.

566
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:25,279
You look nervous.

567
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:26,073
Do I?

568
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:27,644
Huh.

569
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:29,313
I’m just not so sure what I got you into.

570
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:30,127
What do you mean?

571
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:32,474
Well, my family’s not going to take my sister’s engagement too well.

572
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,003
They can be a little vicious when annoyed.

573
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:37,351
Hey. Relax. You do not have to worry about me at all.

574
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:40,597
Five years of Friday night dinners have prepared me for exactly this moment.

575
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:41,258
Really?

576
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:43,614
Remind me to tell you about the time my mom climbed out

577
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:45,790
a second story window to get away from my grandmother.

578
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:47,167
Ah, I will.

579
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,134
- Okay, ready?
- Ready.

580
00:21:59,222 --> 00:22:00,474
You are late!

581
00:22:00,546 --> 00:22:01,287
Fifteen minutes.

582
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,620
Well, it’s awful! A morgue! It’s like they already know what I’m going to tell them.

583
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:06,367
Well, you have been with Josh for three years now.

584
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:08,619
I don’t understand it. I called and told them that you were coming

585
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:10,573
because that usually makes Mom happy.

586
00:22:10,694 --> 00:22:13,596
And I told her that you were bringing Rory so they’d be on their company behavior,

587
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,160
but from the minute Josh and I walked in that door it’s been iceberg city!

588
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:18,795
Josh has completely panicked.

589
00:22:18,947 --> 00:22:19,613
Shaking.

590
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,667
Wow. Sorry.

591
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,884
Don’t be sorry. Just get in here and stop it.

592
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:28,706
Hm. Remind me to tell you about the time my mother wore a shirt with a rhinestone penis on it

593
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:30,652
and my grandma had her car towed.

594
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:37,559
Look at the ceiling!

595
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,290
Come on.

596
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:41,291
Have you seen this ceiling?

597
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:42,248
Hurry!

598
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:47,517
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

599
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,557
Sorry we’re late, everyone.

600
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,061
It’s all right, Logan, we’re still waiting for your father.

601
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:53,666
Hey Grandpa, nice to see you.

602
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:54,869
Did you get those books I sent you?

603
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:55,791
I did, thank you.

604
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,352
Hey, Josh, it’s been a while, you’re looking well.

605
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:57,942
You too.

606
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,450
Everyone, I’d like you to meet Rory Gilmore.

607
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,121
Hi. It’s really nice to meet you all. This house is amazing.

608
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:06,164
Seriously, there should be a docent at the door.

609
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:08,259
Well, thank you, Rory.

610
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:10,526
You know Rory’s grandparents, Mom. Richard and Emily.

611
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:12,472
Yes, of course.

612
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:14,254
How are Richard and Emily doing?

613
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:15,232
They’re doing very well.

614
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,477
Oh, that’s wonderful.

615
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:29,470
So, um, you were at the wedding, right?

616
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,837
Oh. Well, yes. We were.

617
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,075
Oh, it was lovely.

618
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,472
Emily certainly knows how to plan an event.

619
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:37,504
That she does.

620
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,581
I should send her a note.

621
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:51,466
Hey, Grandpa, can I freshen your drink for you?

622
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:56,330
Oh, I’m sorry. Can we get you something, Rory?

623
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,262
I got it, Mom.

624
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,433
Oh, Logan, I don’t think I should –

625
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:10,896
- It’s club soda, Ace.
- Oh, thanks.

626
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,153
Apparently Mitchum is still at the office.

627
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:20,019
We might as well start dinner.

628
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:23,019
So.

629
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:25,551
Come on. You’ll feel better when you’ve had some food.

630
00:24:25,693 --> 00:24:27,060
I’ll feel better when we’re leaving.

631
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:29,765
So sorry. We owe you one.

632
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,621
No. Is that a Velazquez?

633
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:34,623
Come on.

634
00:24:35,095 --> 00:24:37,189
It is! That’s a Velazquez!

635
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:39,001
This house is so cool!

636
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:48,048
So, I am holding in my hand one of our comment cards on which a particular person has written,

637
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:50,782
and I quote, best meal I’ve ever had. The duck was exceptional,

638
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:53,624
the lamb chops were amazing. Ask the chef if he’ll marry me.

639
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:54,202
What do you think?

640
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,277
I don’t know, what does she look like?

641
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:56,244
I didn’t say it was a she.

642
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:57,817
I’ll stick with what I have.

643
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:00,281
Aw, sweet. I didn’t know you were making lamb chops.

644
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:03,147
Last minute addition. You know, your cooking crew here is great!

645
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:03,582
Really?

646
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:06,865
Yeah, Mark the salad guy? Top-notch. Javier is one hell of a grill man,

647
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:10,694
and Manny, your sous-chef? I’d kick Caesar out on his ass if I could steal Manny.

648
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,827
Oh, you covet my kitchen staff. Feeling superior and I like it!

649
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:20,571
Okay, guys, we need two sea basses, one chicken, one pepper steak without the pepper, go figure –

650
00:25:20,712 --> 00:25:21,795
Where’s Pedro going?

651
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:36,330
I knew it!

652
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:37,865
Are you insane?

653
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:39,407
Well, you wouldn’t take my calls!

654
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:40,537
How long have you been up here?

655
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:43,631
Since you made me promise that no food would leave the premises.

656
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:46,278
Well, here I am, keeping my promises.

657
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:47,195
Pedro, give me the ladle.

658
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:49,016
Pedro, do not give her that ladle.

659
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:50,180
Give me the ladle, Pedro.

660
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:51,936
Vente uno con migo, Pedro!

661
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:53,808
Hueso su jefe, Pedro!

662
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:56,411
You’re scaring Pedro.

663
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,198
All day long things are disappearing.

664
00:25:58,244 --> 00:25:59,493
Salads are suddenly gone.

665
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:01,735
Lamb chops don’t make it to the table.

666
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,641
I had to make sure you were doing it right.

667
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:04,905
You’re supposed to be home!

668
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,445
No! I’m supposed to be in bed! And I’m in bed!

669
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,441
And you said that you would double-strain the duck sauce

670
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,807
and you, my friend, are not double straining!

671
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:15,181
There will be no more of this. No more calls. No more questions.

672
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:17,940
No more ladles that leave that kitchen.

673
00:26:18,084 --> 00:26:21,254
I don’t care what bed you’re in. That is between you and your husband

674
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,439
and God, I hope a qualified therapist.

675
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:26,570
But you will not interfere with me anymore.

676
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,388
Period.

677
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:31,730
Give me that.

678
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,659
So, Grandpa, how’s the new boat?

679
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:38,672
It’s a boat.

680
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:39,973
It floats.

681
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:41,913
I hear it’s beautiful. When are you going to let me take her out?

682
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,447
Now, Logan, you don’t have the best track record when it comes to boats.

683
00:26:45,513 --> 00:26:47,364
Only other people’s boats. Our boats are very safe.

684
00:26:47,412 --> 00:26:49,823
We should do a summer trip. Maybe hit the Amalfi Coast again?

685
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,087
All of us. Rory, Josh, you, me.

686
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:53,781
Dad!

687
00:26:53,865 --> 00:26:54,555
Maria!

688
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:55,405
Yes, sir?

689
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,044
It’s too hot. Bring me a salad.

690
00:26:58,369 --> 00:26:59,261
I’ll be right back.

691
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:04,007
What?

692
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:06,101
Mom’s a stress smoker.

693
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:09,813
Oh. I don’t understand why everyone’s so upset. Josh seems fine.

694
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:11,697
The Huntzbergers aren’t interested in fine.

695
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:12,362
Shira!

696
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:13,212
Yes, Dad?

697
00:27:13,324 --> 00:27:15,143
What time did Mitchum say he’d be here?

698
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,097
I don’t know.

699
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:18,352
He didn’t say.

700
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:19,515
Well, this is ridiculous!

701
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:21,169
Please, Dad.

702
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,323
We’re all just going to sit around this table and pretend there’s nothing going on?

703
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:25,737
Let’s just wait for Mitchum!

704
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:27,739
There are serious matters to be discussed here.

705
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,736
This is an important family.

706
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:32,121
Marrying into it is important business.

707
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,515
But no, we can’t discuss this until Mitchum gets here!

708
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:37,410
What is this? Go away!

709
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:39,351
Okay, I’m sorry. I have to jump in here.

710
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:42,104
Grandpa, we all respect you and Mom and Dad,

711
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:44,572
but the bottom line here is, Honor has to be happy.

712
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,144
Now, if she loves Josh, then –

713
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:49,125
Logan, I appreciate you defending me but I can take it from here.

714
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:51,485
Mom, Grandpa,

715
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,535
I had hoped that you would be happy for me, but obviously that’s not going to happen.

716
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:58,253
You didn’t even let me announce it to you before you formed your opinion,

717
00:27:58,315 --> 00:28:02,083
and I’m sorry you feel the way you do, but Josh and I made it official last week.

718
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,360
We are engaged now and no matter what you say, we are going to get married.

719
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:06,286
In June.

720
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,717
Well, of course you’re going to get married! You’ve been dating for three years,

721
00:28:09,774 --> 00:28:12,830
and I already put a hold on the Japanese Tea Garden for next spring.

722
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:14,812
Oh. Well,

723
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,525
that sounds great, thank you!

724
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:19,102
So we should celebrate then!

725
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,683
We’ll celebrate when we have finished our discussion!

726
00:28:21,744 --> 00:28:22,656
Which discussion?

727
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:26,609
The discussion about unsuitable people marrying into this family.

728
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:27,955
- What?
- I’ll be right back!

729
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,070
You should know better than this, Logan!

730
00:28:30,193 --> 00:28:34,410
I know you like to joke around, and tease us, but I always thought at the end of the day,

731
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:37,853
you understood what your responsibilities to this family were!

732
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:40,447
Mom, I suggest you come back in here, right now!

733
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,007
Logan, you just haven’t thought about this.

734
00:28:44,094 --> 00:28:46,101
I mean, I’m sure Rory understands.

735
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,728
She wants to work. Isn’t that right, Rory?

736
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:51,739
Emily’s always talking about you wanting to be a reporter

737
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,160
and travel around doing this and that.

738
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:58,552
A girl like Rory has no idea what it takes to be in this family, Logan.

739
00:28:58,619 --> 00:28:59,325
Oh my God.

740
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:02,358
She wasn’t raised that way. She wasn’t bred for it.

741
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:05,117
And this isn’t at all about her mother, it’s just,

742
00:29:05,184 --> 00:29:07,503
you come from two totally different worlds.

743
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:08,896
It would never work.

744
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:12,125
Not for you, and certainly not for us.

745
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,980
Okay, this conversation is going to end right now. I am not going to sit here –

746
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,959
You are going to be taking over this company!

747
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:18,475
That’s what you are going to be doing!

748
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:22,392
And when you do, you are going to need the right kind of person at your side.

749
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:23,959
This isn’t college, Logan!

750
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:26,233
And whatever happened to that Fallon girl?

751
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:29,001
I loved her. Do you talk anymore?

752
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:31,347
No, we don’t talk! We never talked, you talked.

753
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:32,447
Oh, what a shame.

754
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,543
I just loved her.

755
00:29:33,614 --> 00:29:34,393
Okay. Let’s go.

756
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:37,389
Logan. You have to understand.

757
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,754
You bring this girl home without any warning at all,

758
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:42,524
and Honor tells us you’re calling her your girlfriend!

759
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:44,720
We have to take that seriously.

760
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:46,635
Logan, come back here!

761
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:47,726
I don’t understand!

762
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,477
They’re psychotic. What more is there to understand?

763
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:51,919
But why don’t they think I’m good enough?

764
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:52,656
Rory.

765
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:55,410
I mean, I’m a Gilmore! Do they know that?

766
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:58,094
My ancestors came over on the Mayflower!

767
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:00,352
Don’t try to analyze it, there’s no rhyme or reason!

768
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,034
I had a coming out party! I went to Chilton, and Yale,

769
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,344
and why are they okay with Josh?

770
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,554
I mean, he doesn’t even say anything! At least I noticed the Velazquez!

771
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,227
Josh isn’t marrying the heir to the Huntzberger fortune, you are.

772
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:12,891
I’ve got to get out of here.

773
00:30:12,962 --> 00:30:14,078
Logan! Perfect.

774
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:18,579
Did they start dinner? Is it some sort of precious fish dish?

775
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:19,844
‘Cause I’m dying for a steak.

776
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:21,501
You’re Rory, I assume.

777
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:22,485
Heard a lot about you.

778
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:23,288
We’re leaving.

779
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:24,273
What? Why?

780
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:25,179
You know why.

781
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:28,194
Had a long day, Logan. Don’t want to play games. Is dinner over?

782
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:31,103
No. The Huntzberger family Shanghai is over.

783
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,224
Dinner, however is still going on.

784
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,896
Oh, okay. Okay. What happened?

785
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,090
Oh, no. Why is your mother smoking?

786
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:40,913
We have to go.

787
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,494
I’m sure they’ll fill you in on everything.

788
00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:45,444
It was nice to meet you.

789
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:55,550
Paris, come on in, we’re just chatting.

790
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:56,370
I see that.

791
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:58,074
I got to tell you, Paris, you were right.

792
00:30:58,188 --> 00:30:59,274
This stuff is magic.

793
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:00,916
Esa e majica.

794
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,734
She just taught me that.

795
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,795
She’s great!

796
00:31:09,856 --> 00:31:10,819
Yeah, she is.

797
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:12,508
So, you seem better!

798
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,885
I am so much better.

799
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:17,593
Nanny’s got me salving every four hours, I’ve steamed, I’ve had soup.

800
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:20,101
All I need now is one more good Nyquil knockout sleep,

801
00:31:20,154 --> 00:31:21,412
and I’ll be as good as new.

802
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:22,687
Hey, could you?

803
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,090
Oh, sure.

804
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:28,103
I’ve got to tell you, Paris. You’re a lifesaver. Really.

805
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:32,108
Paris?

806
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:34,480
Paris, the Nyquil!

807
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:37,813
Doyle, it’s time we have a talk about our relationship.

808
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:38,523
But –

809
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,453
Doyle, focus!

810
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:43,362
- Hey. You in the hat.
- Jackson, what are you –

811
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:45,409
How dare you take a ladle from a pregnant woman!

812
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:45,757
What?

813
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,098
Dr. Menck very specifically said that she needs to relax

814
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:50,985
and she cannot relax thinking you’re in here screwing up her sauce!

815
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:51,646
I’m not!

816
00:31:51,718 --> 00:31:55,230
Now, while there’s a very good chance that you could kill me in a fight, I do not care.

817
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:57,744
That woman is my wife, and she is carrying my baby.

818
00:31:57,795 --> 00:32:00,682
So from now on, if she wants to talk, you will talk!

819
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:03,765
If she wants to taste your food, you will let her taste your food!

820
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:07,329
If she wants you to double-strain that sauce, you will double-strain that sauce, my friend!

821
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:10,468
Because I have to live with her and if she is upset because of anything that you have done,

822
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:12,822
I will come over here and I will soundly kick your ass!

823
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:14,450
That is if you haven’t killed me yet!

824
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:16,765
Hey!

825
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:24,107
Hey. That’s it. I’ve had it.

826
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:24,840
You’ve had what?

827
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:27,958
She’s a crazy woman, and now she’s upstairs

828
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:30,885
and ladles are mysteriously flying out of the kitchen.

829
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:31,542
Who’s upstairs?

830
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:32,735
Sookie’s upstairs!

831
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:33,617
No, Sookie’s at home.

832
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,140
No, Sookie’s supposed to be at home.

833
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:39,533
And then I didn’t strain the sauce twice, so she came here to drive me crazy

834
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:41,214
and she brought her loony husband with her!

835
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:42,728
Jackson’s here? How am I missing all of this?

836
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:44,612
I don’t know, and I don’t care!

837
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:47,019
I’m through! I’m not taking this anymore!

838
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:49,436
What do you mean, you’re not taking it anymore? What are you going to do?

839
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:50,399
You want to know what I’m going to do?

840
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,721
Nothing! Because I am in a relationship with you and you know very well I can’t leave.

841
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:57,121
All I can do is come out here and say I’m through and pretend I have a leg to stand on

842
00:32:57,178 --> 00:33:00,203
and then march back into that kitchen and keep doing the job,

843
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:02,323
but, oh, boy. I’m going to be thinking about what I would have done

844
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:04,608
if we weren’t in a relationship, even though that would mean

845
00:33:04,643 --> 00:33:06,443
I wouldn’t be in this position in the first place.

846
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,433
Excuse me.

847
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:22,107
Ah, if this is the eccentric couple version of the Amazing Race,

848
00:33:22,157 --> 00:33:23,315
I think you guys are winning.

849
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:25,552
Are we talking to her? I don’t think we’re talking to her.

850
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,602
Hey, it’s Lorelai!

851
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,019
Girlfriend of Luke, and we’re not talking to Luke.

852
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,710
Well, I’m talking to Lorelai. How you doing?

853
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,311
Sookie, this is not bed rest.

854
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,172
My feet are up.

855
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:34,565
I told you not to talk to her.

856
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:36,325
What is with the ‘tude, cranky pants?

857
00:33:36,402 --> 00:33:37,380
He’s very mad at Luke.

858
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:38,251
Well, I’m not Luke!

859
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:39,627
By extension, you are Luke.

860
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,225
Sookie, what were you doing at the Inn?

861
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,693
Checking in on the restaurant. That’s my job.

862
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:46,545
Not anymore. Your job is bed rest.

863
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:49,904
Ooh, honey, easy on the bumps. Baby doesn’t like the bumps.

864
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,682
Jackson, stop.

865
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,519
She and that boyfriend of hers. Bossiest couple in town.

866
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,198
Stop! At least let me ride!

867
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:58,546
Okay. Go.

868
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:03,068
Sookie, you knew the day was coming when you wouldn’t be able to come in!

869
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:04,179
I had three weeks.

870
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,410
You never had any applications, did you?

871
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,440
I meant to.

872
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:08,586
No one was good enough.

873
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:11,244
Well, no one’s as good as you, but plenty of people are good enough!

874
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:13,528
We just need one of them, just till you’re back on your feet.

875
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:14,260
I know!

876
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:16,062
You know, Luke’s not as good as you either.

877
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:19,043
That kind of cooking’s a little fancy for him, but he tried.

878
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:21,781
Yeah, he’s not bad. He’s pretty good, in fact.

879
00:34:21,832 --> 00:34:23,514
What does he put in these?

880
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:24,720
What is that?

881
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:27,302
His lamb chops. They’re amazing, I’m taking them home to study.

882
00:34:27,368 --> 00:34:28,555
Well, you could have just asked him.

883
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:29,817
Hm, he’s mad at me.

884
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:30,844
We’re mad at him!

885
00:34:31,065 --> 00:34:33,814
We’re all going to stop being mad at each other. Now, pull over.

886
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:34,413
Why?

887
00:34:34,494 --> 00:34:35,759
Because, uh, you live here.

888
00:34:36,077 --> 00:34:36,901
Oh, yeah.

889
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:41,719
You know, Luke said that Manny was doing pretty well.

890
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,076
I know, I trained him.

891
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:46,701
You know, when I first met him he didn’t know a cafette from a chiffonade.

892
00:34:46,762 --> 00:34:48,329
Yeah, well, he’s from New Jersey.

893
00:34:48,391 --> 00:34:49,527
And he picked it up quick.

894
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:52,139
Maybe he can take over while you’re out. Keep it in the family.

895
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,424
He knows all your secrets.

896
00:34:53,782 --> 00:34:56,250
Okay. We’ll go with Manny. He’s a good guy.

897
00:34:56,312 --> 00:34:57,592
I think that’s a good idea.

898
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,574
Thank Luke for me.

899
00:34:58,635 --> 00:34:59,127
I will.

900
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,255
And find out what’s in these lamb chops, because they’re driving me crazy!

901
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,127
I promise. Jackson, get her inside. Don’t let her move.

902
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:06,280
Hey, how are you going to get back?

903
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,041
Oh, I thought I’d take the cart you guys stole.

904
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:09,111
Perfect!

905
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:10,463
This all turned out pretty good.

906
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:20,242
So.

907
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,075
Okay if I just drop you here?

908
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:23,428
Drop me here?

909
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,385
Yeah, lights are on. Paris is home. I’ve had about all the crazy I can for one evening.

910
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:28,900
Okay. Sure.

911
00:35:29,234 --> 00:35:31,957
You know we don’t have to go in, we can go get something to eat.

912
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:33,698
I’m not hungry.

913
00:35:34,553 --> 00:35:35,249
Okay.

914
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:37,272
I just want to walk a little, clear my head.

915
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:38,567
Okay.

916
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:41,321
I’ll call you later.

917
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,006
Tomorrow?

918
00:35:43,216 --> 00:35:44,896
Uh, yeah. Tomorrow.

919
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:58,172
Does it seem like Frodo is on every fricking channel to you, or is it just me?

920
00:35:58,576 --> 00:36:02,217
God, I have never been this tired.

921
00:36:02,314 --> 00:36:05,181
Aw. You were one hell of a white knight today, baby.

922
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:07,869
Yes, I’m a regular Lancelot.

923
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,910
You’re starting to snooze.

924
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,667
Do you want to go upstairs, or are you okay right here?

925
00:36:18,316 --> 00:36:19,092
Luke.

926
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,093
What did you put in the lamb chops?

927
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,120
Forget it.

928
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:25,083
Come on!

929
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:27,985
Saved by the bell.

930
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:29,133
I’ll be right back.

931
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:32,175
Hello?

932
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,132
You busy?

933
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:33,996
What’s wrong?

934
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,255
Dinner was awful.

935
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,182
Hold on.

936
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,101
Okay, hit it.

937
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,835
Well, to make a long story short,

938
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:46,597
Logan’s family hates me.

939
00:36:46,945 --> 00:36:47,939
That’s impossible.

940
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:50,115
It’s like hating Thumper. No one hates Thumper.

941
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:51,308
They think I’m trash.

942
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:53,843
They think I’m not good enough to marry into their family.

943
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:56,192
What are they talking about? Don’t they know you’re a Gilmore?

944
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:57,195
I don’t think they care.

945
00:36:57,304 --> 00:36:59,705
Ah, pfft. And who said anything about marrying into their family?

946
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,142
Apparently, Logan bringing me over for dinner

947
00:37:02,218 --> 00:37:04,492
said that I was going to marry into their family.

948
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:05,562
Uh, that’s crazy.

949
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:08,470
I know! But then they got all panicked and they started saying all these things –

950
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,182
To your face?

951
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:10,192
Right there at the dinner table!

952
00:37:10,246 --> 00:37:10,650
What?

953
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:13,764
They went on and on about how I’m going to be a career woman

954
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:16,836
and Logan, you don’t want that, she won’t understand our lifestyle

955
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,498
or the demands, or, or the family responsibilities!

956
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:23,042
What family responsibilities? Who are they, the Gambino’s?

957
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,347
Then his mother starts in on that lovely Fallon girl,

958
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:27,394
and doesn’t Logan see her anymore?

959
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:29,002
Because she would make a perfect choice!

960
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:29,969
And what did you say?

961
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:30,706
Nothing.

962
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:31,735
I just sat there.

963
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:34,393
I just sat there and let them say that I wasn’t good enough,

964
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:36,400
and that Logan was making a mistake,

965
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:38,903
and just wait till his father came home!

966
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,773
I hate these people!

967
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,837
It was awful.

968
00:37:42,313 --> 00:37:45,995
Well, Logan didn’t just sit there and let them attack you all night, did he?

969
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:49,569
No. He got really mad and he told them they were all crazy and then we left.

970
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:50,793
Well, good for him.

971
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:55,042
But we didn’t say a word to each other all the way home.

972
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:58,443
And then walking back to my dorm,

973
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,433
he just looked so freaked.

974
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:03,300
I could tell that he was just,

975
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:06,542
I don’t know, rethinking everything.

976
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:07,961
The whole relationship.

977
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:11,207
I’m just afraid he’s going to bolt.

978
00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:13,945
Mom?

979
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,761
Can I say something? Something you may not want to hear?

980
00:38:18,016 --> 00:38:18,743
Yes.

981
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,542
If he is going to bolt, maybe you should let him bolt.

982
00:38:22,649 --> 00:38:26,161
He told you, Rory, he told you he was not a commitment kind of guy,

983
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:28,732
just like you’re not a non-commitment kind of girl.

984
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:31,286
And you tried to be something you weren’t and it was bad.

985
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:34,784
It didn’t work for you. Don’t try and force him to be something he’s not.

986
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:35,787
I didn’t force him!

987
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:39,792
I know, but he was looking at losing you, and he didn’t want to

988
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:42,270
and I give him credit for that, but maybe in the end

989
00:38:42,331 --> 00:38:44,758
this is not the guy or the relationship for you.

990
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:46,340
I don’t care what his family thinks.

991
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:47,957
This has nothing to do with his family.

992
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:50,047
We’re good together, Mom. I’m good for him.

993
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:51,410
But maybe he isn’t good for you.

994
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:52,360
People can change!

995
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:54,619
Do you really want to be in the business of changing someone?

996
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,073
Maybe he wants to change!

997
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:59,948
Rory, two days ago you were on the bathroom floor crying about why he won’t call you.

998
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,577
Why doesn’t he like you, what did you do?

999
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:03,384
I was drunk. I was sick!

1000
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:06,846
You, my beautiful, brainy, fabulous daughter,

1001
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,930
were lying on the floor of the bathroom,

1002
00:39:09,032 --> 00:39:10,722
wondering what you had done wrong!

1003
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:13,256
Which is disturbing to me on several levels, including the fact

1004
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:16,601
that I can’t remember the last time I cleaned the floor of the bathroom!

1005
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:19,012
Is that really the kind of relationship you want to be in?

1006
00:39:20,722 --> 00:39:21,407
Hold on.

1007
00:39:29,262 --> 00:39:29,998
Hey.

1008
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:33,080
Everything okay?

1009
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:34,330
I’m sorry.

1010
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:35,794
For what?

1011
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,546
For just taking off like that.

1012
00:39:37,914 --> 00:39:40,936
I just, this was a very intense evening for me.

1013
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:41,683
I’m sure.

1014
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:45,565
But taking off like that, I was overreacting, that’s just stupid.

1015
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,247
So, forgive me?

1016
00:39:49,624 --> 00:39:50,971
There’s nothing to forgive.

1017
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:54,125
Come on, grab your coat. I’ll take you to get something to eat.

1018
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:56,137
Okay. I’ll be right back.

1019
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:02,286
Did you hear that?

1020
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:03,632
Yeah. I sure did.

1021
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:05,897
Everything’s fine. I just got upset about nothing.

1022
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:06,873
Okay, but –

1023
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:09,489
Thanks for the talk, Mom, and I heard you, but I have to go.

1024
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,608
Okay. Call me tomorrow.

1025
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:13,310
I will.

1026
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,014
He got dumped two years ago.

1027
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,331
Apparently, it was a vicious Julia Roberts to Kiefer Sutherland kind of dump.

1028
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,758
She broke his heart, slept with his best friend, and took the dog.

1029
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:29,663
He swore off women completely until he met me.

1030
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:31,925
Wow. That was a lot of ground you guys covered last night.

1031
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:34,081
He finally admitted, once his cough started coming back,

1032
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,160
that what we have he no longer views as casual.

1033
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:38,198
He said we are officially in a committed –

1034
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:38,895
Hey, I know that word!

1035
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:42,228
Relationship, and I would not be remotely out of line if I called myself his girlfriend.

1036
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,854
And then I handed him the Nyquil, and then he passed out.

1037
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:45,694
Very romantic.

1038
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,355
I know.

1039
00:40:46,426 --> 00:40:47,280
I’m happy for you.

1040
00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:49,631
I’m happy for me too. Mr. Huntzberger!

1041
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:50,676
Hello, there.

1042
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,520
Hello, Rory.

1043
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:52,287
Hi.

1044
00:40:52,355 --> 00:40:53,962
Paris Gellar. We met a couple of months ago.

1045
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,599
I remember the handshake. Reminded me of Jimmy Breslin’s.

1046
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,414
High compliment.

1047
00:40:57,603 --> 00:40:58,529
Would you excuse us?

1048
00:40:58,605 --> 00:40:59,466
Oh, sure.

1049
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:02,349
Are you looking for Logan?

1050
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,575
No, I know better than to look for my son in the newsroom.

1051
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:06,722
I came to talk to you.

1052
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,100
About what?

1053
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:10,225
I’m very sorry about what happened the other night.

1054
00:41:10,397 --> 00:41:11,037
It’s okay.

1055
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:14,392
My family behaved atrociously, and, though Logan was a little naïve

1056
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:17,075
to walk into the lion’s den without a chair like that,

1057
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:19,188
they were wrong and you deserve an apology.

1058
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:21,042
Okay. Thank you.

1059
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:25,539
So, I hear you have some rather lofty journalistic aspirations.

1060
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,404
I have plans.

1061
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:29,097
You know, my company just acquired a small newspaper.

1062
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:31,079
The Stamford Eagle Gazette.

1063
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:34,626
Decent circulation, pretty sorry writing, but definite potential.

1064
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:37,477
When we buy a new paper, I like to spend some time there.

1065
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:40,647
Take a couple of months, help turn it around, make sure we’re getting our money’s worth.

1066
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:43,197
Stamford isn’t a bad train ride from here, is it?

1067
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,539
Um, no.

1068
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,924
I have an internship available, if you’re interested.

1069
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:48,792
An internship?

1070
00:41:48,928 --> 00:41:50,998
Be a good chance for you to get your feet wet.

1071
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:53,216
Experience how the real thing works.

1072
00:41:53,903 --> 00:41:54,625
No.

1073
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:56,355
Thank you.

1074
00:41:56,771 --> 00:41:57,876
No, thank you?

1075
00:41:57,938 --> 00:41:59,628
I appreciate the offer.

1076
00:42:00,107 --> 00:42:01,276
But no.

1077
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:09,407
May I be so bold as to inquire,

1078
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,291
why the hell not?

1079
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:16,323
Because I have a feeling that the only reason you’re doing this

1080
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,600
is because you feel guilty about what happened the other night at dinner,

1081
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:23,497
and it’s very nice, but very unnecessary.

1082
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:26,032
So what?

1083
00:42:26,928 --> 00:42:27,845
Excuse me?

1084
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:31,618
Say the only reason I offered this to you is because my family behaved badly

1085
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:35,396
and I wanted to make up for it. Say I have no interest in furthering your career.

1086
00:42:35,463 --> 00:42:37,368
This is still an opportunity.

1087
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:39,691
Who cares why you got the opportunity?

1088
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:43,640
It’s here, and life is about making the most of everything you’re handed.

1089
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:46,278
Well, this is being handed to you. Now,

1090
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:48,218
what are you going to do about it?

1091
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:53,829
Monday. Ten o’clock. Call my office for the details.

1092
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:54,949
And bring a pencil!

1093
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,061
You never know when you’re going to need a pencil!

1094
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:11,062
