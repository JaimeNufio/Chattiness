1
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:05,790
I don't know if you forgot,
but we've been in Paris,

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,602
and we flew across oceans and
oceans just to see you again.

3
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:12,154
And, so, we would really
like to see you again --

4
00:00:12,163 --> 00:00:14,992
today, tonight, A.S.A.P., okay?

5
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,437
So please call me.
Call me back.

6
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:21,446
S.T.A.S.A.P --
sooner than as soon as possible.

7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,340
Okay, honey, call me.
Call me. Call me.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,679
Call. Okay. Bye.

9
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:28,061
Okay, that was your last one.
I'm cutting you off.

10
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:30,090
She will call you
when she wakes up.

11
00:00:30,927 --> 00:00:32,098
Now sit.

12
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:36,646
I need an open mind.
Are you giving me an open mind?

13
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:37,597
Okay, it's open.

14
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:38,403
Wide open?

15
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:42,102
Yeah, yeah, blue skies, green grass,
vistas as far as the eye can see.

16
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:44,176
Good, because I want
you to picture,

17
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:45,928
on this wall,

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,348
a waterfall.

19
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,245
You know, one of those wall waterfalls--
they're really soothing.

20
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:51,483
- Slam --
- What?

21
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:53,016
The sound of my mind closing.

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,052
Come on. We could get
a barcalounger right here

23
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:57,246
and just lean back and listen--
it'd be like living in Hawaii.

24
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:59,163
Are you serious--
a barcalounger?

25
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,456
Soft leather, button back pad
adjustable footrest.

26
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:02,685
You know what else
would be awesome?

27
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:04,277
Not having a barcalounger?

28
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:06,941
Flat-screen TV here--
high def, day and night.

29
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:08,353
You know what else might work?

30
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,578
One of those electronic fish--
what do they call it? --

31
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:11,947
the big-mouth billy bass.

32
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:13,350
You know what they are, right?
When somebody walks by,

33
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:15,575
they flap their mouths
and sing songs like

34
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:17,760
"Don't worry,
be happy" and "Take me to the river."

35
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:20,483
You're kidding.

36
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,409
I'm totally kidding, except for the
flat-screen. We need a flat-screen.

37
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:26,201
No! I'd rather have the
big-mouth billy bass fish.

38
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:27,197
What's wrong with
the flat-screen?

39
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:30,170
It's so "meet Georges Jetson,
his boy, Elroy" -- Leroy?

40
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:31,886
Elroy -- and it's not.

41
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:34,430
Look, I'm all for
small-town charm.

42
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:37,074
I'm happy to move here,
sit out on the front porch,

43
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:39,052
and give the mailman a
real chipper "howdy-do."

44
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:40,653
- Don't you dare.
- But there's a line.

45
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,983
I'm not gonna cobble my own shoes,
churn butter,

46
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,065
or watch a TV from 1976.

47
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:48,582
What? This baby has a remote
that has 19 buttons on it.

48
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:50,021
You do have running water,
don't you?

49
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:50,972
Hardy Har Har.

50
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,129
Oh, you can say "hardy Har Har,"
but I can't say "howdy-do"?

51
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:54,145
Life's not fair.

52
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:56,638
What's your problem with a giant
flat-screen? I mean, you love TV.

53
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:57,992
Yeah! But just because
I love something

54
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:00,016
doesn't mean I want
it to be giant.

55
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,588
I love grapes, you know,

56
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:04,072
but I don't want to sit down
and eat one humongous--

57
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:05,358
No, that would be fun.

58
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:06,729
Hello?

59
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,226
Hey. Welcome home.

60
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,423
Finally! I have been
calling and calling.

61
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:12,235
Yes, I know, since 5:00 a.m.

62
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:14,105
Well, that's noon
parisian time.

63
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:15,628
Well, then you should call
your parisian daughter

64
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:17,356
because your american
one was asleep.

65
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,176
- Hi, honey.
- Your dad says hi.

66
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,953
Hi dad, how was the trip?

67
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:23,913
Tonight. I'll tell you everything
when you come for dinner tonight.

68
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:25,038
I can't come tonight.

69
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:26,409
What? You have to.

70
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:27,521
I have a study group.

71
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:29,802
My major english quotes
professor's trying to kill me.

72
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,988
Well, all the more reason
to stay away from him.

73
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:33,785
Seriously, he sounds dangerous.

74
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:34,993
I'll  come over the weekend.

75
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:36,796
No, Rory, it has to be tonight.

76
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:37,861
Why?

77
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:40,821
Uh... s-snails.

78
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:41,915
Snails?

79
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:45,226
W-We --
your dad and I brought back snails.

80
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:46,345
For eating?

81
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:50,018
Yes, and if we don't
cook them tonight,

82
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,534
they'll go bad.

83
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,428
Mom.

84
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,941
Well, it's true.

85
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:56,214
It has to be tonight. Please.

86
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,218
- Fine. I'll be there.
- Good!

87
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,436
I'm going back to bed.

88
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:03,387
Oh, what? At 1:00 in the afternoon?
Lazy girl.

89
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:04,951
My parisian daughter's
such a go-getter.

90
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:06,354
She's been up and
around for hours.

91
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:07,369
See you tonight.

92
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:10,158
All right, she's coming.

93
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,159
Snails?

94
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:14,600
Well, I just --
as long as she's coming.

95
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:15,637
So you said snails?

96
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,258
Well, I had to say something.

97
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,262
Well, at least we
have a plan now.

98
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,379
We'll sit her down in the kitchen,
feed her snails,

99
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:23,288
and tell her we got married.

100
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:24,854
Oh, my god.

101
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:27,078
I just hate that
she doesn't know.

102
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:29,053
She's gonna know tonight
when we tell her.

103
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:30,349
Yeah.

104
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,264
- Lor?
- Yeah.

105
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,588
She's gonna be happy.

106
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:36,311
Her parents just got married.
It's the dream.

107
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:37,828
Yeah.

108
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:40,360
Maybe I should tell
her by myself.

109
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:42,353
Together -- we agreed.
We're gonna tell her together.

110
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:43,716
Yeah,  no, you're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

111
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:46,008
I'm just so used to it
just being me and her.

112
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,849
I'll feel better
when she knows.

113
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:49,586
Well, she'll know tonight
when we tell her...

114
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:51,033
- Yeah.
- ...with snails.

115
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,789
Now we have to get snails.

116
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:54,381
- We'll find snails.
- Where do you get snails?

117
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:56,633
- Maybe Doose's has snails.
- Doose's doesn't have snails.

118
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,215
Well, then, we'll go
to a snail store -- emporium.

119
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:00,212
We'll find snails.

120
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,478
And a recipe.

121
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,961
They will have a recipe
at the snail emporium.

122
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:05,102
- Really?
- Yeah.

123
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,928
All right.

124
00:04:58,358 --> 00:04:59,712
So you really liked
the chamber music?

125
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:01,488
The part I was
awake for, anyway.

126
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,268
And then, after that,
we went to see a basketball game.

127
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:05,621
Slightly less obscure.

128
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:08,277
Yeah, right? A lot of people seem
to be into the sports thing.

129
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,088
And I can see why --
the fastpace, the school spirit.

130
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:12,133
You liked it?

131
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,080
Again, the part
I was awake for.

132
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,277
Wow, a real
basketball fan, huh?

133
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:20,180
Ah! Oh, my god!

134
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,486
What  is wrong with you!

135
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:25,530
You're not happy to see me.

136
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:27,937
Well, of course I am,
but why do you insist

137
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:30,038
on scaring me half to death
every time you're in town?

138
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:31,632
Well, besides the fact
that it's really fun --

139
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:33,627
well, actually, that's it.
It's just really fun.

140
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:36,905
Oh man. Just once, you could call
me and tell me you're coming home,

141
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,046
like a normal person.

142
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:39,704
Normal's borring.
Normal's overrated.

143
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,310
Normal's not why you love me.

144
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:44,095
So, what's going on?
Why are you here?

145
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:46,313
You know that space we've been
trying to book for our launch party?

146
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,484
- The Orchid room.
- Yeah.

147
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,669
The problem is,
it's booked till 2008,

148
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:52,258
or it was until Nadine Maybrooke
broke up with Jamie Erman,

149
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,876
thus canceling their engagement party
and freeing the space up tonight.

150
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:56,356
Poor Nadine and Jamie.

151
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:58,309
Hey, I invited them.
The more the merrier.

152
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,279
So, it's gonna be huge.

153
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,861
So, you're having your
launch party tonight.

154
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,010
Well, actually,
it's our prelaunch launch party.

155
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:05,638
Our launch party will take
more than 48 hours to plan.

156
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:07,296
It starts at 9:00.
You can be there, right?

157
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,022
Oh yeah,
I'm having dinner with my parents,

158
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,604
but I can stop by right after.

159
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,861
When did they get
back from France?

160
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:14,692
Last night. I would juste skip it,
but my mom really wants to see me

161
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:16,677
and, apparently,
make me snails.

162
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:19,584
Okay. Well, then,
I guess I'll see you post-snails.

163
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:22,670
It should be a pretty good time.
We've got a huge guest list.

164
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,185
Bobbi's pulled
out all the stops.

165
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,515
She's contracted five of the
hottest P.R. agents in the city

166
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:29,538
and has them hunkered
in a war room.

167
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:31,522
I'd be surprised if she lets
them take bathroom breaks.

168
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:32,760
You can't stop Bobbi.

169
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:33,555
Ace.

170
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,377
What? No, I like Bobbi. I do.

171
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,852
I don't like the fact that
she's not a big, swarthy dude.

172
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:41,045
But I recognize that my issues with
Bobbi have nothing to do with her.

173
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,260
She's lovely.
She's your colleague.

174
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,899
It doesn't matter that her
legs come up to my nose.

175
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,243
"A big, swarthy dude"?

176
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:47,547
With a cheesy goatee.

177
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:49,324
Well, maybe she'll
agree to the goatee.

178
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:52,611
And, hey, you want to come with me
tomorrow and check out apartments?

179
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:54,788
Apartments? Like, to live in?

180
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:57,732
I know it is clich�, but, yes,
I intend to live in my apartment.

181
00:06:57,747 --> 00:06:58,797
In Manhattan?

182
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,686
Unless I strike you as
Staten Island kind of guy.

183
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:02,374
- You're moving to New York.
- Pretty much.

184
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,737
Which is an hour away?

185
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:05,116
Actually, an hour
and 20 minutes.

186
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,083
That's so much
closer than London!

187
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:08,648
You've been brushing
up on your geography?

188
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,900
No, I just can't believe it.
I mean, it's huge.

189
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,675
It's amazing. I --

190
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:13,422
Are you happy?

191
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:15,072
I'm so happy!

192
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:17,057
Come on.
Let's get something to drink.

193
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:18,670
But why do you have to
get your own apartment?

194
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:20,078
Why can't you just
live here with me?

195
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,898
I'd love to, Ace, but I think I'd
end up seeing more of the I-95

196
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:24,997
than I would of you.
I mean, my hours are gonna be crazy.

197
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:27,636
If I live near the office,
I can crawl home at 3:00 in the morning

198
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:29,640
- and crawl back to work at 7:00.
- It's a lot of crawling.

199
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:31,768
It just doesn't make
sense logistically.

200
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,505
So it's just gonna be me here?

201
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,087
Well, you were gonna live
here by yourself anyway.

202
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,282
I know, but if you're gonna
have your whole new apartment,

203
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:39,280
then you're gonna
need all your stuff.

204
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,976
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna clean you out, Ace.

205
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,194
I'll be fine. Take your stuff.

206
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,690
It's not gonna happened.
New apartment, new stuff.

207
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:44,564
Really?

208
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:46,769
Yeah.  I-I want a fresh start.

209
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:48,765
Hey, well,
you should take some of your stuff,

210
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:49,953
like your favorite stuff.

211
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:50,958
Like what?

212
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:54,268
Like, you know, you can't live
without your suit of armor, can you?

213
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,782
I mean,
you really want to take that.

214
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:56,972
You don't like Henry?

215
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:00,014
Well, it's not that I don't like him.
It's just that he creeps me out.

216
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:01,807
Oh man,
now you just hurt Henry's feelings.

217
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:04,156
Well, he's gonna have to grow a
little tougher chain mail then

218
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,351
if he's gonna make it on the
mean streets of New York.

219
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:08,041
You're heartless, Gilmore.

220
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:10,938
You hungry?

221
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,078
You want some juice?

222
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,288
Notice my hair is green?

223
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,260
- Uh, hey?
- Diner's ready.

224
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,133
Five more minutes?

225
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,821
After dinner --
wash your hands.

226
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,250
What's so interesting, anyway?

227
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:21,400
Hyperphagia.

228
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,041
Oh, right. Cool.

229
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:25,371
That's just a fancy
term for overeating.

230
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:27,231
It's what bears do in
preparation for hibernation.

231
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:29,668
Oh hey, did I tell you about the time
I saw a grizzly bear on a camping trip?

232
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:32,313
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. 500 pounds, easy.

233
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:35,000
Turkey burgers,
sweet potato fries, broccoli.

234
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,945
Thanks. So, what did you do?

235
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,736
Just backed away real slow,
avoided eye contact --

236
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,330
that's how you show
you're submissive.

237
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:42,123
Really?

238
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:43,555
Yeah, it's all
about body language.

239
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,606
And you've got to
try to stay calm.

240
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:47,190
Were you?

241
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:48,484
No.

242
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,560
I forgot to tell you what happened
with Rachel at school today.

243
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,785
Did she apologize to Melissa?
Are they talking again?

244
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,210
Yeah, but they won't be as
soon as Melissa finds out

245
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:59,098
that Rachel asked Joanna to
come with her to Florida

246
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:00,530
to visit her grandparents.

247
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,504
Hey, did you remember
to wash my jean skirt?

248
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,799
It's hanging in the bathroom.

249
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:05,594
Cool. I want to wear
it to Sabrina's party.

250
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:07,405
I was going to wear
that purple dress,

251
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:10,704
but last time I wore it,
Adam called me "purple Nardini" all day.

252
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:13,417
Yeah, it's a pretty
uninspired insult,

253
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:15,382
but the way he said
it was so annoying.

254
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:19,233
he's probably just gonna
keep saying it all night.

255
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:20,688
"All night"?

256
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:21,705
At Sabrina's party.

257
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:23,959
Why would Adam be at her party?

258
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,955
Because he was invited.

259
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:27,545
To Sabrina's birthday?

260
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,688
Well, yeah.

261
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,587
- Sabrina's a girl, right?
- Yeah.

262
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,208
- And Adam's a boy?
- Yeah.

263
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,079
And he'll be at her party?

264
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:35,651
Yeah, it's a boy-girl party.

265
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:36,907
What's that mean?

266
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,783
It means there will
both be boys...

267
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:41,615
and girls at the party.

268
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:42,467
Yeah. All right.

269
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:45,251
I just didn't know you were going
to boy-girl parties. That's all.

270
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:46,487
It's my first one.

271
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:48,224
I only got invited
'cause Sabrina's parents

272
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:50,131
made her invite
the whole class.

273
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:52,147
But I'm not about to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

274
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,625
So, you're mom's okay with
you going to a boy-girl party?

275
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:57,345
Of course. I'm 13.

276
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,933
So, um, listen.

277
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:02,360
This is probably a
stupid question, but...

278
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,304
is there gonna be
kissing at this party?

279
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,201
Okay! Ew, dad!

280
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:08,498
- What?
- Oh, gross!

281
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,552
What's gross-- kissing?

282
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,921
No, you talking about kissing.

283
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:13,770
What? All right, all right,
I won't say "kissing."

284
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:15,948
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!
Stop! Stop!

285
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:19,451
All right! All right! I'm not saying
it at all. Done -- new topic.

286
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:22,068
I promise.

287
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,139
-  The fries are really good.
- Good.

288
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:29,327
Good. Then eat your
broccoli, too.

289
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:34,150
Hello?!

290
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:35,541
Honey!

291
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:37,449
Oh, hi!

292
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,282
And that's how we do
it on the continent.

293
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:40,366
But of course. Hey, dad.

294
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:41,604
Hi, honey.

295
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:43,271
Come on. Come in! Come in!

296
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:44,883
Okay. What are you wearing?

297
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:46,696
I hear it's called an apron.

298
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,203
Interesting. Why are
you wearing that?

299
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,377
- Because I've been cooking snails.
- You're kidding me.

300
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:52,269
And cooking snails
and dealing with snail spatter.

301
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:53,524
- She really cook those?
- She did.

302
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:54,849
What do you mean?
I told you I was gonna cook them.

303
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,035
Yeah, but I thought it was just
something you say, like a euphemism.

304
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:57,886
A euphemism for what?

305
00:10:57,902 --> 00:10:59,345
A euphemism for "I'm
ordering a pizza."

306
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,840
Come on, sit, sit.

307
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:02,769
So, how was your trip?

308
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,520
Oh, no.
First, a glass of wine --

309
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:07,814
we went to the chateau du
Nozet in the Loire valley,

310
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:09,520
and this is Pouilly fum�.

311
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,718
It's supposed to be one
of the best in the land,

312
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:14,631
and after trying 10 varietals--
note the use of "varietal"...

313
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:15,257
Noted.

314
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,098
...believe me,
you tend to believe them.

315
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,340
We were drunk by the end of the tour.
We bought a case.

316
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:22,066
Cool. So you went to a winery?
What else. What else did you do?

317
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:24,943
Um, here.

318
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,754
Try a snail.

319
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,888
Uh, no.

320
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,400
Please? Come on. I made them.

321
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,122
You try one.

322
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,328
I'm full.
I've been snacking on them all day.

323
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:35,279
Well, see, I had a lunch of bugs
and lizards, so I'm good, too.

324
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,111
All right, I'll try one.

325
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,048
You sure you don't want
a lime and some salt

326
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:40,768
so you can do it
like a tequila shot?

327
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,253
I'm good.

328
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,536
All right, you ready?

329
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:45,782
One, two...

330
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:49,696
- Well, how's it taste?
- Well?

331
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:51,173
Sort of like a
buttered gummi bear.

332
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:52,208
Pass.

333
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:54,768
So, whatelse?
Tell me -- France.

334
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,453
Okay, here it is.

335
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:04,185
While we were in France,
your dad and I --

336
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:05,988
we got married.

337
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,232
What?

338
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:09,587
We got married.

339
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,820
You got married married?

340
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:14,065
- Married married.
- Really?

341
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,378
Wow. Wow. Um...

342
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:23,059
Hey, congratulations.
T-That's-- That's so great.

343
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:24,884
Thanks. We're so excited.

344
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:27,817
Um, how? When?

345
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,525
Two days ago, in Giverny.

346
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:31,144
It's a little town about
an hour outside Paris.

347
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:34,204
It's where Monet had his studio,
where he painted the water lilies.

348
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,661
Oh, so you guys just went
there to get married?

349
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,447
Oh, no, we just went there to
walk around, to see the lilies.

350
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,651
And, um,
then it started raining,

351
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:46,527
and there was this little church,
and, uh...

352
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:49,778
it was so beautiful,
and we were so happy,

353
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:52,022
and we got married.

354
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,192
Wow.

355
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,573
The ceremony was in french,
so there's only a 90% chance

356
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,306
that we're actually married.
There's a 10% chance

357
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,119
we were issued a very
expensive dog licence.

358
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:01,824
Wow.

359
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,058
Wow. Um...

360
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:06,781
Oh, I'm --
I'm so happy for you guys.

361
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:07,903
Really?

362
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,994
You know, we need champagne.
Do we have champagne?

363
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:12,461
Uh, in the cooler in
the garage, maybe.

364
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:14,580
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Okay!

365
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,246
Well?

366
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:23,395
What?

367
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:24,476
What do you think?

368
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:25,907
Um, what do you mean?

369
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:27,738
I mean, what do you think?

370
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,887
I don't know, mom.

371
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,178
I can't believe
that you did this.

372
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:34,325
- You're mad?
- Yes, I'm mad.

373
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,438
- Rory...
- Just stop, okay? Don't.

374
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,240
- Okay, but --
- I can't do this right now.

375
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:41,912
Because dad is about to come
back in here, and I just can't.

376
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,381
Okay.

377
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:46,745
Unfortunately, we went
all the way to France

378
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,560
and didn't come back with
a bottle of champagne,

379
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:51,291
so we're gonna have to make
do with California's finest.

380
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,807
It's okay.

381
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,593
And she showed me her ring,
this huge canary diamond.

382
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:04,912
Looked like something
Paris Hilton would wear.

383
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,639
- Hey, you made it.
- I made it.

384
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:07,638
You look beautiful.

385
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,265
How was the diner?
Did your mom really make snails?

386
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,395
Not only did she make snails,
she got married.

387
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:13,171
- What?
- In France-- to my dad.

388
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,223
- Wow.
- Yeah.

389
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:15,596
-  Wow!
- I know.

390
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,717
How do you feel about it?

391
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,667
You mean besides really bad?

392
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,885
Do you want a drink?

393
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,234
No, I'm good for now.

394
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:22,597
Let's go outside
and talk about it.

395
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,024
No, I'm okay.
I mean, I will want to talk about it,

396
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:26,405
but right now I'm
still processing.

397
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:28,966
Well, it's a lot to process.
Don't feel like you have to stay

398
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:30,393
- if you don't want to.
- Oh, no. I want to be here.

399
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:31,995
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

400
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:34,942
Little-known fact --
I am quite the compartmentalizer.

401
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:37,675
In fact, I have a blister on my heel.
I've been ignoring it all evening.

402
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:39,668
All right. Well, if you change your
mind, you want to talk about it...

403
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,595
I'm fine. This is your night.

404
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:42,593
So how can I help?

405
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:44,636
Just be your charming,
blister-ignoring self.

406
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:47,330
I can do that. So, who's here?
Or, rather, who's not here?

407
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,692
We got a pretty
good turnout, huh?

408
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:49,277
Yeah.

409
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:50,975
All right, see that guy right there?
He's a Rockefeller.

410
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,663
He doesn't like you to talk about
the fact that he's a Rockefeller,

411
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:54,638
but we wants you to know he's a
Rockefeller, so if you talk to him,

412
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:56,729
make sure he knows you know,
but don't say you know.

413
00:14:56,745 --> 00:14:58,725
I'm gonna try to work in
the phrase "Standard Oil."

414
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:01,265
Behind us --
Boykin and his fianc�e, Celery.

415
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:03,080
And, no, I'm not kidding.
Those are their real names.

416
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,301
"Meet my boyfriend, Boykin."
Try saying that five times fast.

417
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,086
- Rory, you made it!
- Yeah.

418
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,216
Hey.

419
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:11,162
- Hey, Rory.
- Hi.

420
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,294
Oh, you look beautiful,
absolutely beautiful.

421
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:15,027
Careful, man, you're drooling.

422
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:17,734
How are things at Yale? Only six months
until you're sprung free, right?

423
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,092
Yeah. Don't remind me.
I'm so not ready to be sprung.

424
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,896
Stop to be brilliant.
Can I get you a drink?

425
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:23,371
- Oh, thanks.
- I'll be right back.

426
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:25,512
- Hello, Rory, darling.
- Hi.

427
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm so happy you made it.
That dress is so cute.

428
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:31,869
Oh, thanks.
Um, your dress is cute, too.

429
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:32,972
Thank you, sweetheart.

430
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:34,621
So, bit of exciting news--

431
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,927
"Page Six" is here.

432
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:37,019
Really?

433
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:38,651
Wow. Congratulations.

434
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:40,280
- It's all Bobbi.
- Oh, rubbish.

435
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:43,606
Oh, before I forget, you sent a
case of champagne to Joe McMillan.

436
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,045
His website's trash,
but we need him to write

437
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:47,033
- something smashing about us.
- Sounds good.

438
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,650
Oscar Schroeder's limo didn't show.
I've got to find him another one.

439
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,450
The gentleman can't be expected
to walk three whole blocks.

440
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:54,817
Ooh, Tripp Cavanaugh?

441
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:56,994
Tripp! Hey, man,
glad you could make it.

442
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,934
- Bobbi, you know Tripp.
- Hi, sweetheart.

443
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:00,889
And this is my girlfriend,
Rory Gilmore.

444
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:02,787
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

445
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:09,570
Tripp's just back from Tortola.

446
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,989
He's building an
incredible house there.

447
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:11,872
Wow, congratulations.

448
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:14,097
Well, we'll see. Construction
on the island is such a joke.

449
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:16,166
I mean,
try getting anyone to meet a schedule.

450
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:17,156
Yeah, I've heard that.

451
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,920
Plus, my property's
totally isolated,

452
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:20,137
which will be great once
the house is built,

453
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,105
but it's a
construction nightmare.

454
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,531
Turns out,
the bridge that accesses my land

455
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:26,168
can't take the weight of the
truck carrying the supplies.

456
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:28,396
We had to off-load the supplies
onto a smaller vehicle.

457
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:29,889
That necessited
two fork-lifts.

458
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,541
None of this is covered
in the estimate, of course.

459
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,402
It never is.

460
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,263
Anyway, so we finally got
the materials -- finally.

461
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:36,344
Oh, great.

462
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,321
Yeah. Unfortunately,
that's when the real trouble began.

463
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:40,902
Without consulting me, they decided
to move the pool over 10 feet

464
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:42,932
'cause the excavation crew needed
more room for their equipment.

465
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,000
Of course, I flip.

466
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:46,730
Who ever heard of a pool right
in the middle of the backyard?

467
00:16:46,747 --> 00:16:48,258
Well, not me.

468
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:51,000
I told them that was unacceptable
and they'd had to move.

469
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:52,207
Can I get a picture
of you guys?

470
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,512
Absolutely.

471
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:55,861
I've got correct
names and spellings.

472
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,615
- Where was I?
- Your pool.

473
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:00,016
Oh right. So we shifted the
thing back 10 feet, thank God,

474
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,617
but when they started
digging in the right place,

475
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:03,321
we found out that
the soil in Tortola

476
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:05,076
is far more porous than
we initially thought.

477
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:06,218
- Oh, god.
- Bummer.

478
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,147
Yeah, bummer, that's right.
So we had to lay down a drainage sysm.

479
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:09,269
At least, that was the plan.

480
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:12,071
But it turnes out that Tortola have
these building codes that specifically --

481
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:13,538
Tripp, have you
met Natasha Wolfe?

482
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,669
No, I don't think so.

483
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,165
Oh, God, you have to meet her.

484
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:18,014
She has a house in Tortola, as well.
Come come.

485
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:19,282
- Oh, will you excuse me?
- Absolutely.

486
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:20,701
Nice meeting you.

487
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:22,956
Um, can we please
never go to Tortola?

488
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,267
I don't even want to
meet John Turturro.

489
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:25,427
Or eat tortellini.

490
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,259
Hey, you'll actually
like this guy.

491
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,342
Hugo.

492
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:30,732
Logan. Hey. How you doing, man?

493
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,630
Not too bad.
This is my girlfriend, Rory Gilmore.

494
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:33,963
Hey, Hugo Grey,
nice to meet you.

495
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:34,551
You too.

496
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:37,063
Hugo spent two years working at the New
York Times, another couple at Slate,

497
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:38,894
and then the Paris review
under George Plimpton.

498
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,609
Wow. Did you just
worship at his feet?

499
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,161
I tried, but he kept telling
me to get off the ground.

500
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,771
Hugo's starting a new online
magazine -- lots of buzz.

501
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:47,946
- It could mean nothing.
- Could mean something.

502
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:49,002
See why I like this guy?

503
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:50,326
You don't have to convince me.

504
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:52,272
Rory's the editor of
the Yale Daily News.

505
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:55,742
I was the editor. I just abdicated my
throne-- or, rather, my swivel chair.

506
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:56,740
That's impressive.

507
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:58,351
Your drink --
sorry it got waylaid.

508
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,097
I need your help, buddy.
Dan Cryer's about one drink away

509
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:01,785
from hitting on
Jerrickson's wife.

510
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,396
That would be bad. Excuse me.

511
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,110
I'm gonna monopolize you a little
bit longer if you don't mind.

512
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:09,517
Once you find somebody that can talk
about something other than stock quotes

513
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:11,586
at one of these things,
you hold on for dear life.

514
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:13,025
Oh God, I know what you mean.

515
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:15,068
It's pretty different
from parties at Yale?

516
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:17,599
Fewer drunken musing
on Roland Barthes.

517
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:19,854
Although, on the plus side,
I am learning a great deal

518
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:22,129
about the tackiness of
the canary diamond.

519
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,932
They're not teaching
that these days?

520
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:26,874
Tell me they at least have a
course in piloting the family jet.

521
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:27,966
Sadly, no.

522
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,835
Man. No wonder we're
falling behind the japanese.

523
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,321
Is it the chinese now?

524
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:34,191
We're definitely
falling behind someone.

525
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,322
So, what kind of pieces
you write at Yale?

526
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,633
A little bit of everything. That's
the great thing about being editor --

527
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,463
you can pretty much give
yourself the best pieces.

528
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:42,795
I got to interview Barack
Obama a couple weeks ago.

529
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:44,647
- He came to speak at campus.
- Really?

530
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,878
Did you ask your buddy Barack
if he's gonna run in 2008?

531
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:49,105
What kind of journalist
would I be if I didn't?

532
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,056
And?

533
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,790
Standard answer --
"no current plans."

534
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,200
But I saw a twinkle in his eye.

535
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,659
Well, you can't
quote a twinkle.

536
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,049
But you can describe it.

537
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:57,631
Good point.

538
00:18:57,647 --> 00:18:59,499
Hey, listen. If you want to
submit something to my site,

539
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,015
I'd be happy to
take a look at it.

540
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:04,192
Really? Wow, that would be great.
What kind of pieces are you looking for?

541
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:05,937
Cultural and
social observations.

542
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:08,601
We're sort of Slate meets New
York Times' "lifestyle" section,

543
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:10,176
before they sold out.

544
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,622
You can definitely write
about a party like this.

545
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:12,226
Really?

546
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:14,280
I got Cryer talking golf --
disaster averted.

547
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:15,497
Good job.

548
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:17,251
I've got to take off, man.
I got an early morning.

549
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:19,536
All right, man. Thanks a lot for
coming out. I really appreciated.

550
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,716
No, thank you.
It was nice to meet you, Rory.

551
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,699
- You too.
- And here's my card.

552
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:23,946
- There you go.
- Thanks.

553
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:25,278
- Bye, I'll see you guys around.
- Bye.

554
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:27,170
Thanks. Look at you,
getting a card.

555
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:28,992
I know. He said
I should submit a piece for him,

556
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:30,151
like something
about this party.

557
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:31,208
Seriously? You have to do it.

558
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:32,358
I know. I am.

559
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,679
Logan, Rory,
I am so sorry I got pulled away.

560
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:36,969
Natasha Wolfe actually has a house
on another one of the beef islands.

561
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:40,674
Not Tortola. Still, she had an interesting
experience when she was building...

562
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,232
Okay, I'm just gonna leave
you one more message,

563
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,668
and then I'm gonna
start sending telegrams.

564
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:52,065
Honey, I know you think this
marriage was a big step, and...

565
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,826
and it seems impulsive to you,
and we talked about going slow,

566
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:58,445
and this seems like
the opposite of slow.

567
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:00,044
And, in some ways, it is.

568
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,381
And, in some ways,
it really isn't.

569
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:06,711
And I really want to
talk to you about it.

570
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:09,874
So, please, call me back...

571
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:14,192
or respond to any of my
forthcoming telegrams.

572
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:16,251
Okay. Bye-bye.

573
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,103
I don't know,
I think the piece is good.

574
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:24,500
I was just on a roll.
You know, I mean, I was hopped up.

575
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,398
I couldn't sleep.
I was just way too excited,

576
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:29,460
and I drank way too much coffee--
way too much coffee.

577
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,759
Oh, I should really stop talking
and let you finish reading.

578
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,816
One new message.

579
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,986
Okay, I'm just gonna leave
you one more message --

580
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,002
So...

581
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:46,531
What do you think?

582
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,052
I don't know what to say.

583
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:56,283
Oh, I know the ending is a
little convoluted, but I --

584
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,169
It's not convoluted.
You made your feelings perfectly clear.

585
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:00,483
What do you mean?

586
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
Just that it must have been
really hard for you at my party,

587
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,616
surrounded by all those people with --
how do you put it?

588
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,325
"Who can no more imagine a
world without trust funds

589
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:08,416
than a world without water --
imported and bubbly, of course."

590
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,124
Oh, no,
that was meant to be funny--

591
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:11,657
It sounds like it was torturous,
being stuck there

592
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,813
with "these overprivileged sons
and daughters of somebodies

593
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:16,510
who fail to grasp how out of
touch they seem to those of us

594
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:18,541
who don't have an errant
domestic employee

595
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:20,815
or a construction
problem on beef island."

596
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:22,696
- You're mad?
- You're damn right I'm mad.

597
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,912
But you were making fun of
these people all night.

598
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:27,193
I was joking. I wasn't standing
there judging everyone.

599
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:28,478
I didn't judge everyone.

600
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,790
The title of your article
is "Let them drink cosmos."

601
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:32,363
I was joking around with my girlfriend.
I wasn't comparing

602
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:34,348
a whole class of people
to Marie Antoinette.

603
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:37,138
I'm so sorry. I really didn't
think that this would upset you.

604
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,403
You didn't think
it would upset me?

605
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:40,963
No. No, I was just writing.
I mean, I was worked up.

606
00:21:40,978 --> 00:21:43,879
I was mad at my mom. Maybe that
kind of got into the piece somehow.

607
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:45,329
But, no,
this was meant to be funny.

608
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:47,440
I didn't think you would
take it personally.

609
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:49,155
I mean, you're totally
different from these people.

610
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:51,046
No, I'm not, and you know what?
I don't want to be.

611
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:51,755
Logan.

612
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:54,238
What? I'm a rich trust-fund kid.
I'm not ashamed of it.

613
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:56,845
No, and you shouldn't be.
That's not what I meant.

614
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,003
I mean, my point,
or the point I was trying to make

615
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:02,226
was that people use
connections to get ahead.

616
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:04,866
Oh, give me a break. You act like making
connections is something nefarious.

617
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:06,263
It's not.
It's just people meeting people.

618
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:08,230
Well, it's certain people
meeting certain people.

619
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,879
It's not like anyone's
meeting Joe bus driver.

620
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:12,126
- And you're Joe bus driver.
- Well, no, but --

621
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,990
Exactly. Where do you get off
acting all morally superior?

622
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,349
That is not what I
intended to say at all.

623
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:19,200
You clearly think you are. Why?

624
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:22,097
Because you read "Ironweed"?
'Cause you saw "Norma Rae"?

625
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:24,619
Wake up, whether you like it or not,
you're one of us.

626
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:27,189
You went to prep school.
You go to Yale.

627
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:29,856
Your grandparents are building a whole
damn astronomy building in your name.

628
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:33,222
That is different, okay? It's not like
I live off a $5-million trust fund

629
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:34,451
my parents set up for me.

630
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:36,760
Well, you're not exactly
paying rent, either.

631
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:41,403
Screw you, Logan.

632
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:48,631
So, you're getting ready
for the party, huh?

633
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,236
Yep.

634
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:50,827
I can get you some
real wrapping paper.

635
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:53,275
Did you not see "An
inconvenient truth"?

636
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,116
Are you okay?

637
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:57,446
Yeah, I just have a little stomachache,
that's all.

638
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,110
Okay, what do you think? I put this
article on darfur on the front,

639
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:02,518
to put things in perspective in
case Sabrina doesn't like the CD

640
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:04,244
- that I picked out for her.
- It looks pretty good.

641
00:23:04,277 --> 00:23:07,324
So, I wanted to talk
to you about tonight.

642
00:23:08,018 --> 00:23:10,471
Hey, are you sure you're okay?
Maybe you should get something to eat.

643
00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:12,723
I'm not hungry.
Hand me the tape, please.

644
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:14,306
Sweetie, you don't
look so good.

645
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,205
That's not a nice thing to say
to someone who's on her way

646
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:17,547
to her first boy-girl party.

647
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,608
- Oh yeah. Sorry.
- Tape, please?

648
00:23:19,623 --> 00:23:21,126
So, look, about the party.

649
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,054
Yeah?

650
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:25,412
I want to talk to you about that thing
we were talking about the other night.

651
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:27,319
I'm not gonna use
the "k" word, okay?

652
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,425
Instead, I'll just
use "juggling," okay?

653
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,065
- "Juggling"?
- Juggling.

654
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:32,852
Okay.

655
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,965
Okay, so here's the thing.

656
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:38,887
Even if all the other
kids are juggling

657
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,793
and you might feel like
you want to juggle, too,

658
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:45,511
I don't think you should
juggle before you're ready.

659
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,309
I know.

660
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:48,160
And I don't think you're ready.

661
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:49,408
How do you know?

662
00:23:49,422 --> 00:23:51,573
Well, let's put it this way.
I'm not ready.

663
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:54,891
That seems kind of arbitrary,
since you're not the one doing it.

664
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:56,369
Yeah, it may be, but, still,

665
00:23:56,382 --> 00:23:58,948
if I let you go to this party,
you have to promise me

666
00:23:58,964 --> 00:24:03,093
that you won't
juggle with boys.

667
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:04,626
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

668
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,411
Yes. Fine.

669
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:08,922
Okay.

670
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,165
Shoot, where'd I
put Sabrina's card?

671
00:24:12,563 --> 00:24:14,234
Oh, there it is.

672
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:17,917
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

673
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:19,673
- I feel fine.
- Come here, let me feel your forehead.

674
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,353
I feel fine.

675
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:23,444
April, you have a fever.

676
00:24:23,456 --> 00:24:24,689
I swear, dad, I feel fine.

677
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:27,098
Yeah, you can't go to
the party if you're sick.

678
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:29,061
- I'm not sick!
- Yeah, you are, sweetie.

679
00:24:29,078 --> 00:24:30,720
You're just saying that 'cause
you just don't want me to go!

680
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:32,938
- That's not true.
- It is! You don't trust me!

681
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:35,354
Of course I do.
Look, there will be other parties.

682
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,357
- No!
- I'm sorry, April. You're sick.

683
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:39,431
- I'm not!
- Yeah, you are, sweetie.

684
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,088
- I can go!
- No, you can't.

685
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:42,892
You suck as a dad!

686
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,395
You have no messages.

687
00:24:52,468 --> 00:24:54,574
I think this is the
last of the clothes.

688
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:55,473
Ah yeah?

689
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,713
Aah! Come here. What is that?

690
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:57,458
What?

691
00:24:57,888 --> 00:24:59,791
It's a shirt.
What's wrong with a shirt?

692
00:24:59,902 --> 00:25:01,649
Let's start with the color.
It's peach.

693
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,822
I look good in peach.

694
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,620
Exactly. Men who buy peach
shirts buy it 'cause they think

695
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,443
they look good in peach, which
means they really thought about it,

696
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:09,179
which means they're
obsessed with their looks!

697
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:10,722
I'm not obsessed with my looks!

698
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:13,389
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you a peach shirt.

699
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:15,470
Oh, just leave my stuff alone.

700
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:19,374
- Oh, my god, you dirty thief.
- Excuse me?

701
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:22,309
You stinking, lying,
stinking, ratty, dirty thief!

702
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:22,894
What?

703
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:25,837
This is my Police
"Synchronicity" t-shirt.

704
00:25:25,852 --> 00:25:28,207
I have been missing
this for 22 years!

705
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:29,701
I asked you if you had it!

706
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:32,561
I looked you right in the face,
and you denied it!

707
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:33,787
I lied.

708
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:36,752
Oh, you lied! You lied!

709
00:25:36,843 --> 00:25:39,064
Do you know how long
I looked for this?!

710
00:25:39,077 --> 00:25:41,635
Days and days! And then I accused
my mother of throwing it out,

711
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:43,350
and she said she didn't, and,
oh, my god, I hated her.

712
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:45,258
Oh my god, I could have had the
best relationship with my mother

713
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:46,812
if you hadn't stolen my shirt.

714
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:49,278
Well, keep laughing, buddy,

715
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,883
because, I'll tell you,
the laugh's on you now!

716
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,982
You better get used
to seeing this shirt,

717
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:58,015
because I have to make up for
22 years of not wearing it.

718
00:25:58,028 --> 00:25:59,039
Where do you think
you're going?

719
00:25:59,072 --> 00:26:01,120
I'm dropping this stuff
off in Rory's room.

720
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:02,711
Actually, I guess
it's G.G.'S room now.

721
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,344
Wow, that's weird, huh?

722
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:05,618
Really weird.

723
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:08,266
A big sellingpoint -- the proximity
of this room to the kitchen.

724
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:10,367
I don't know why, but G.G.
was incredibly psyched about that.

725
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,611
Why? You feed her, don't you?

726
00:26:11,627 --> 00:26:13,110
I knew there was something
I was forgetting.

727
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,327
W-What are you doing?

728
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:16,647
I'm juste seeing how heavy it is. I thought
maybe we could move it in the garage,

729
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:18,058
get G.G.'s coloring
table in here.

730
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:20,101
Yes, or we could just
leave it right here.

731
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:22,000
Nah, G.G.'s not gonna need
it for a couple years.

732
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:23,131
Oh, you know what
I was thinking?

733
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,388
- Trundle beds.
- Trundle beds?

734
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:25,941
For when Rory comes to visit.

735
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:28,242
Uh, okay. Wait.
I'm sorry. Slow down.

736
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:29,471
Why?

737
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:35,118
I just -- I don't want to change Rory's
room all around without consulting her.

738
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:37,467
She's not gonna care. She's graduating
from college in the spring.

739
00:26:37,503 --> 00:26:39,704
Right, and lots of college
graduates end up back home,

740
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,430
where they need their desks.

741
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:42,159
Lor.

742
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:43,960
What? I'm just being
realistic, okay?

743
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,766
It's not like she's gonna be
an investment banker. You know.

744
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:48,229
She's gonna be a journalist,
and journalists get paid crap.

745
00:26:48,244 --> 00:26:50,264
So, if she needs money,
we'll help her out.

746
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:51,507
Right. Okay. That's fine.

747
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:54,780
But, still, why not just
leave Rory's room as it is?

748
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:56,908
Give G.G.
something to aspire to.

749
00:26:56,924 --> 00:27:00,017
Things worked out pretty well for Rory.
I mean, she went to Yale.

750
00:27:01,104 --> 00:27:02,127
Lor...

751
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:03,860
Chris?

752
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:07,496
I know it's difficult,
but things around here are gonna change.

753
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:09,483
You think I don't know that?

754
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:11,811
I just, uh...

755
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,589
I don't want Rory to feel like the
rug's being pulled out from under her,

756
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:17,460
you know,
like she's being kicked out.

757
00:27:17,473 --> 00:27:18,764
Rory's gonna be fine.

758
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,391
You don't know that.
She's already upset.

759
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:23,031
About what?

760
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:26,944
About you and me,
about the marriage.

761
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:28,942
She seemed fine
when we told her.

762
00:27:28,954 --> 00:27:31,540
In front of you,
and then you left, and...

763
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:34,052
...she told me she
was really upset.

764
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:36,287
What? H-How could
you not tell me that?

765
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:37,810
Well, honey, I --

766
00:27:37,826 --> 00:27:40,073
No, I'm her father, Lorelai.
We're married now.

767
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,262
Okay, well,
I'm telling you now.

768
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:45,627
Let's call her.
We should talk about it.

769
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,037
- I did.
- And?

770
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:50,230
And she's not
answering right now.

771
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:53,183
But it'll be okay, you know?
It'll be fine. It's just --

772
00:27:53,198 --> 00:27:55,517
It's a sensitive thing,
and, uh...

773
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,254
and I-I just feel like
we should give it time,

774
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:01,683
you know, before
we spring trundle beds on her.

775
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:04,310
Yeah, okay.

776
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,330
I mean,
she just needs time to adjust.

777
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,333
- Okay.
- Okay?

778
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,886
There's a few more things I
got to bring in from the car.

779
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,051
He's the one who insisted
I move in with him.

780
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:34,374
Begged me practically.

781
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:37,309
And now he throws it back in my face,
like I'm some kind of leech.

782
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:39,582
- That's such a low blow.
- So low.

783
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,835
- I hate everyone today.
- Including us?

784
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,543
Well no, not you guys,
but don't cross me, sister.

785
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,103
Keep reading, Liv.

786
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,020
I'm practically homeless.
I mean, obviously, I can't live there.

787
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:50,323
You can move in with us.

788
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:52,070
- Is that allowed?
- Well, not technically.

789
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,304
But we have a hot plate, and we're
not allowed to have that either.

790
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:56,368
Will you finish reading that
article so I can read it?

791
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:57,634
Okay, okay.

792
00:28:57,645 --> 00:28:59,184
Seriously, Rory,
you should just move in here with us.

793
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:02,216
We'll make a smaller common room.
We'll put up a temporary wall.

794
00:29:02,231 --> 00:29:03,417
You know how to do that?

795
00:29:03,428 --> 00:29:05,477
I don't,
but boyfriend's super handy.

796
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,522
Oh, right.

797
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:09,792
He put up those bookshelves, and
they're fine for, you know, paperbacks.

798
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:11,470
You know what?
Don't worry about me.

799
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:13,551
You guys are taking enough of
a risk with that hot plate.

800
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:14,772
I will figure something out.

801
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:15,798
Well, if you need to...

802
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:16,975
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

803
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:17,830
Here.

804
00:29:18,084 --> 00:29:19,758
So, what did you think?

805
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:21,540
- It's a really great piece.
- You think?

806
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:23,525
- Yeah, you're an awesome writer.
- Thanks.

807
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:27,037
It was sharp and funny, and I could
totally see everything and
imagine everyone.

808
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:28,783
Thanks. And it's
not mean, right?

809
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:30,049
No, no, it's mean.

810
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:32,475
Yeah, it is mean,
and I'm only on the first paragraph.

811
00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:33,807
Keep reading,
it get's meaner.

812
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:34,755
It's mean?

813
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:36,771
Sort of Lynn Hirshberg meets --

814
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,036
I don't know,
someone really mean.

815
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:40,818
What? No!
No, I'm Fran Lebowitz.

816
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:42,783
It's supposed to
be fun, frothy,

817
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:45,362
lighthearted satire,
social anthropology.

818
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:46,523
I'm Tama Janowitz.

819
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,280
A mean Tama Janowitz.

820
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:50,676
Oh, god. I'm mean?

821
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:53,516
I'm mean and judgmental,
and I didn't even mean to be.

822
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,152
I was just trying to sell an article.
No wonder he's upset.

823
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,552
Come on! He knows you.
It wasn't intentional.

824
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,573
That's worse!
I didn't even mean to be mean,

825
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:03,433
and I was mean.
Mean and judgmental and insensitive.

826
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:06,138
I really do hate everyone today,
including myself.

827
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:08,428
Great. The circle's complete.

828
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:12,055
You sure you don't want some ginger ale?
It'll settle your stomach.

829
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:15,228
- I feel fine.
- Okay.

830
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,742
How about a movie?
I could rent us a movie.

831
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:21,588
Come on, April.
Look, I know you're a little upset.

832
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,609
But, I promise you,
there will be other parties.

833
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,224
Come on, talk to me.

834
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:33,269
Wow! Okay,
you're really hot, sweetie.

835
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:35,187
Hang on a minute.

836
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:47,260
Hello?

837
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:48,832
April's really sick,
and I don't know what to do.

838
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:51,431
She's got a fever, and it's her stomach.
And she's really pale, so--

839
00:30:51,464 --> 00:30:53,016
Okay. Slow down.
Did she throw up?

840
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,599
No.

841
00:30:53,612 --> 00:30:54,710
Did she eat something bad?

842
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:56,399
No, she hasn't eaten
anything all day.

843
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:57,866
Aw, where does it hurt?

844
00:30:57,882 --> 00:31:00,083
- She's holding her side.
- Which side?

845
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:02,079
Her right side.
It seems to be getting worse.

846
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:04,617
Oh, you know,
it could be appendicitis.

847
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:06,431
Appendicitis-- Really?

848
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:09,558
Yeah, it's gonna be okay, but you should
take her right to the hospital, okay?

849
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:11,994
- Take her to St. Joseph's.
- Okay. Okay.

850
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,461
- We have five minutes left.
- No, we don't.

851
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:19,380
I checked my watch
before I fed the meter.

852
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:20,204
So did I.

853
00:31:20,217 --> 00:31:21,835
You couldn't have.
Because we've got five minutes left.

854
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:22,832
No.

855
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:25,086
Five minutes have passed since you
started this inane conversation.

856
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,836
So if I were you, I'd put another
quarter in and call it a day!

857
00:31:28,157 --> 00:31:29,937
You need to check
your watch battery.

858
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,661
This is a quartz Timex.
You wind it.

859
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:37,160
Hey.

860
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:38,819
- Oh, hey.
- How is she?

861
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:41,502
Okay. It was appendicitis,
like you said.

862
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:43,459
But she's okay.

863
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:45,130
The operation went
really great.

864
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:47,777
They got it out, no problem.
And she's gonna be fine.

865
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,206
And I'm gonna be able
to see her pretty soon.

866
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,161
- Good, good.
- Yeah.

867
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:53,759
You didn't --
you know you didn't have to come,

868
00:31:53,776 --> 00:31:55,650
but thanks for coming.

869
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,911
There's nothing worse than taking
your kid to the emergency room.

870
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:01,146
You know,
I remember Rory had food poisoning,

871
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:02,612
and they had to hook
her up to an I.V.

872
00:32:02,627 --> 00:32:05,768
and she just looked
so little and scared.

873
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:08,767
It made me feel like they were
gonna have to hook me up to an I.V.

874
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:11,156
Yeah, I was almost out of my mind,
I was so scared.

875
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:12,578
At one point,
I got so panicked,

876
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:14,256
I was thinking maybe I'd
give her my appendix,

877
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:17,008
if they could do some kind of
a transplant or something.

878
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,375
But I was a little
out of my mind.

879
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,118
- Well, I'm glad she's gonna be okay.
- Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

880
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:23,539
Mr. And Mrs. Nardini?

881
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:25,870
Oh, no. Hi, I'm Luke Danes.
I'm April's dad.

882
00:32:25,884 --> 00:32:27,872
Well, she's a little
out of it right now,

883
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:29,465
but you and your wife
can go in and see her.

884
00:32:29,498 --> 00:32:31,988
- No, she's not my...
- No, I'm not, uh...

885
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:35,863
Oh. Sorry. I just assumed.

886
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,551
So, would both of you
like to go in and...

887
00:32:40,565 --> 00:32:41,732
- I'll just...
- You go.

888
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:43,553
- Okay.
- Okay.

889
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:44,436
Bye.

890
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:53,279
Trust me. Don't call him today.

891
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:55,400
He's going to put
his money down.

892
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:56,991
He just doesn't like
the aggressive stuff.

893
00:32:57,024 --> 00:33:00,261
We have to sit back,
relax, let him come to us.

894
00:33:00,276 --> 00:33:02,613
If we don't hear from him in a week,
then we panic.

895
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,313
Yeah. Nick,
I got to call you back.

896
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:07,695
All right. Bye.

897
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:09,346
Sorry.

898
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,021
I hope it's okay that I'm here.

899
00:33:11,037 --> 00:33:12,577
Hey, it's your apartment.

900
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:16,296
Rory... I'm so
sorry I said that.

901
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:17,699
Yeah, well...

902
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:20,010
I was way out of line.
I just...

903
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:23,300
I love it that you're here. You know
that I love it that you're here.

904
00:33:23,563 --> 00:33:25,439
Yeah. No, I know.

905
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:27,181
I was just upset.

906
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:30,905
Well, you had every right to be.
That article was awful.

907
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:32,746
- It wasn't awful.
- It was awful.

908
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:35,295
And mean and judgmental,
as you said.

909
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:37,675
I just--
I don't even know why I didn't see that

910
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,034
or what I was thinking,
except that maybe I wasn't thinking.

911
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,240
- Look, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

912
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,185
I was just trying to
write a clever article,

913
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,741
and I didn't mean to upset you,

914
00:33:45,754 --> 00:33:48,100
but I should have thought about it.
I should have known.

915
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:49,527
But if that's the
way you feel...

916
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:51,630
But that's just it.
It's not the way I feel.

917
00:33:51,644 --> 00:33:53,737
You don't have to approve
of everything I do.

918
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:55,389
I know that, but I actually do.

919
00:33:55,404 --> 00:33:58,465
I mean, I have total respect for
everything that you're doing.

920
00:33:58,481 --> 00:33:59,857
I'm so proud of you.

921
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:00,921
I know you are.

922
00:34:00,936 --> 00:34:02,831
Do you?
Because I really need you to know that.

923
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:03,749
I really know that.

924
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:06,025
- Because I really am.
- I know.

925
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:07,492
- Promise?
- I promise.

926
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:10,502
And look, the truth is, I wouldn't be so
upset if you weren't such a good writer.

927
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:13,398
I mean, talk about the pen being
mightier than the sword. It's true.

928
00:34:13,412 --> 00:34:14,961
That pen of yours
is a howitzer.

929
00:34:14,977 --> 00:34:16,191
You don't have to say that.

930
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:17,888
I wouldn't if it wasn't true.

931
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,794
Can we talk about something
besides the article?

932
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,201
You got to compliment me.
Let me compliment you.

933
00:34:22,217 --> 00:34:24,695
- We're complimenting each other now?
- If you'll let me.

934
00:34:25,095 --> 00:34:26,739
I guess that's okay.

935
00:34:27,395 --> 00:34:29,290
You're a really
great writer, Ace.

936
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:30,710
You have great hair.

937
00:34:30,722 --> 00:34:33,222
You've got awesome teeth.
I've always admired your teeth.

938
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,276
Really? I never knew.

939
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,139
Yep, particularly
the bottom ones.

940
00:34:36,153 --> 00:34:37,375
I love you so much.

941
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:38,803
I love you, too.

942
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:45,584
Um, but here's the thing.
I have to move out of this apartment.

943
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:48,164
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

944
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:50,505
I always thought that you
would come back and live here.

945
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:53,726
But now that you're getting your own
place nearby, it's just different.

946
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,626
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

947
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:58,427
It's just something
I have to do for me.

948
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:01,861
But you should know that I
plan on taking Henry with me.

949
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:08,237
You'll have to take that up with him.
You did insult him earlier.

950
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:10,032
Did I? Hmm.

951
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:13,916
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm sorry.

952
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:16,542
I would have buzzed up,
but I saw a delivery guy coming in,

953
00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:18,442
so I slipped in with him.

954
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:21,020
Boy, they sure do
eat well over in 4-F.

955
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,899
- Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Come on in.

956
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,054
What are you doing here?

957
00:35:27,154 --> 00:35:30,161
Well, I just--
I wanted to see you.

958
00:35:30,826 --> 00:35:33,163
Look, I got to run out and
take care of a few things.

959
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:35,215
- Good to see you, Lorelai.
- Thanks. Good to see you.

960
00:35:40,926 --> 00:35:43,041
I'm guessing your
cellphone's not broken, huh?

961
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:44,691
I just didn't feel
much like talking.

962
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:46,628
I know.
Look, I know you're upset.

963
00:35:46,642 --> 00:35:49,332
I know this seems sudden and
like we didn't think it through.

964
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,173
And in a way, it was impulsive.

965
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:54,463
But in other ways,
it's been 20 years in the making.

966
00:35:54,477 --> 00:35:57,530
That's not why I'm upset.
I'm glad you're married.

967
00:35:57,602 --> 00:36:01,407
- You're glad?
- Yes, I'm -- I'm happy for you.

968
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:02,873
It's wonderful.

969
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,227
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

970
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:05,789
You're great together.
You love each other.

971
00:36:05,824 --> 00:36:08,399
I mean, it's every kid's dream, right?
Parents get back together.

972
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:10,189
But I wasn't there.

973
00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:12,302
You weren't there.

974
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:14,428
I should have been there
when you got married.

975
00:36:14,445 --> 00:36:16,128
Yes, you should
have been there.

976
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:18,161
I mean, how would you feel if I
got married and you weren't there?

977
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:20,451
- Awful. I would feel awful.
- I feel awful.

978
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:22,495
Look, I'm sorry. You know, I --

979
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:24,021
Of course I wanted
you to be there.

980
00:36:24,035 --> 00:36:26,314
I could have been there. All you
had to do was make one phone call.

981
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:28,123
You could have picked up the
phone and said, "come to Paris,"

982
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:30,617
- and I would have come to Paris.
- I know that and I did.

983
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:32,480
I wanted to call you.

984
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:35,605
But then I thought,
if I called you,

985
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,942
then you'd want to talk about it,
and I'd have to explain.

986
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:42,387
And then maybe I would
talk myself out of it.

987
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,802
I mean, after everything that
happened with the engagement,

988
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:47,211
I didn't want a debate.
I didn't want to explain.

989
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:50,124
I just wanted to do it,
because I am so certain, Rory.

990
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,147
I'm so certain that
this is right.

991
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,189
I really wanted to be
married to your dad,

992
00:36:55,204 --> 00:36:59,263
and I didn't want to talk my way
out of it. I just wanted to do it.

993
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:00,770
I wouldn't have
tried to stop you.

994
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,430
I wouldn't have tried
to talk you out of it.

995
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:03,917
- No?
- No.

996
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,663
I mean,
the only thing I might have said

997
00:37:05,677 --> 00:37:08,444
is maybe you guys would want to come
back to the States to get married

998
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:11,031
so you could have some close friends
there, like Sookie and Jackson,

999
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,988
maybe grandma and grandpa, G.G.

1000
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:15,876
Or maybe you would have wanted
to live together for a while,

1001
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,436
like six months,
just to try it out.

1002
00:37:18,548 --> 00:37:20,804
Yeah, I totally would have
talked you out of it.

1003
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:22,913
Oh, I'm sorry.

1004
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:26,417
No, don't be sorry. I mean,
I'm really happy for you and dad.

1005
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:27,951
It's amazing.

1006
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:29,820
It is amazing.

1007
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:31,324
You're married.

1008
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:32,543
I know.

1009
00:37:32,604 --> 00:37:34,463
- It's big.
- It's big.

1010
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:35,997
It's a big change.

1011
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:38,259
But nothing's gonna change
between you and me.

1012
00:37:38,274 --> 00:37:39,824
I don't want you to feel weird.

1013
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:40,964
Okay.

1014
00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:44,706
Of course, your dad is gonna put
flat-screen TVs in every room in
the house,

1015
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:46,470
but your house is
still your house.

1016
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:48,176
Your room is still your room,

1017
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:50,984
though we did talk about putting
a trundle bed in for G.G.,

1018
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:53,432
so it'd kind of be your room and
G.G.'s room. We don't have to do that.

1019
00:37:53,465 --> 00:37:55,533
- No, I'm down with a trundle bed.
- You are?

1020
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:57,152
Yeah, I love a good trundle.

1021
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,753
I'll trundle it up with G.G.

1022
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,693
Hey, you didn't take dad's name,
did you?

1023
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,598
No. No. "Hayden"? No.

1024
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,015
I don't want to be Mrs. Hayden
planetarium for the rest of my life.

1025
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,056
I'm Lorelai Gilmore, okay?

1026
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:11,575
Lorelai Gilmore without
the "Gilmore" is like...

1027
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:14,260
Gil, you know, less.

1028
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,911
Okay.

1029
00:38:30,514 --> 00:38:32,514
- What ya doin'?
- Hey. I'm sorry.

1030
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:34,537
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you up.

1031
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:37,528
You probably shouldn't be moving
furniture around at midnight, then.

1032
00:38:37,544 --> 00:38:39,016
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1033
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,864
- When did you get back?
- Half an hour ago.

1034
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,833
How's April?

1035
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:43,684
She's appendix-less,
but she's gonna be okay.

1036
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,365
Good.

1037
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:45,707
I saw Luke.

1038
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,086
- Was it okay?
- It was fine.

1039
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,352
Good. It's good you went over.

1040
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:51,540
But then I went to see Rory.

1041
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:52,297
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1042
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:53,984
- How is she?
- She's good.

1043
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,703
- We talked, and she's good.
- Good.

1044
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:57,198
And she's really happy
that we're married.

1045
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,635
I knew she would be.

1046
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:05,647
Hey, I was thinking
about the room.

1047
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:09,120
And I was thinking we should paint it,
and we should let G.G. pick the color.

1048
00:39:09,132 --> 00:39:11,813
- She's gonna pick pink.
- Pink would be great in here.

1049
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:12,867
Come on,
help me moves this out.

1050
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:13,999
Okay.

1051
00:39:16,278 --> 00:39:19,591
Hey, so I was upstairs.
I got an idea.

1052
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:22,477
How about a flat-screen
in the bedroom?

1053
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:23,381
The bedroom?

1054
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,398
- Come on.
- No!

1055
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,691
Think about it!

1056
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:31,181
Let's take a look at the
national weather map and see

1057
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:32,885
what's in store for the
country over the next f--

1058
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:35,954
The biggest males
weigh over half a ton.

1059
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:39,418
And they're tall enough,
at 10 feet, to see forever.

1060
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:43,936
The russian brown bear is
identical to our grizzly --

1061
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,315
ursus arctos horribilis,

1062
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:48,424
"the horrible bear."

1063
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:51,452
Are your closets and drawers so
cluttered you can't find a thing?

1064
00:39:51,468 --> 00:39:53,802
The killings were the
latest in a series --

1065
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:57,092
"Tow years ago, I did you out of a wedding
in this house by eloping to Maryland."

1066
00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:00,362
Two years ago,
you were invited to a wedding--

1067
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:01,889
Just a loan.

1068
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:03,481
- Put this in your vest pocket.
- Don't have a vest.

1069
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:05,109
Then hold it in your hand.

1070
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:08,507
- "Which was very bad manners."
- Which was very bad manners.

1071
00:40:08,518 --> 00:40:11,211
"But I hope to make it up to you by going
through with it now as originally planned."

1072
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:13,168
But I hope to make
it up to you by --

1073
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:18,106
By going beautifully
through with it now...
