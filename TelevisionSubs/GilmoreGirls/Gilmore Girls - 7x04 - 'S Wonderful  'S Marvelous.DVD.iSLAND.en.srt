1
00:00:01,758 --> 00:00:03,391
Let me bottom-line it for you.

2
00:00:03,406 --> 00:00:05,646
Snakes are gross.
Snakes are scary and slithery,

3
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:07,584
and do you know where
snakes do not belong?

4
00:00:07,597 --> 00:00:09,205
- On a plane?
- They do not belong on a plane.

5
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:10,461
It's not an ideal situation.

6
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,648
They do not belong
anywhere except in cages

7
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:14,747
stuck in safes buried deep,
deep underground.

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,289
- I hate snakes!
- So I'm gathering.

9
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,150
With their gross, no-legged bodies,
and their scaly, scaly skin,

10
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:21,078
and their wiggling,
and their hissing.

11
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:23,886
Okay, Lor. I respect your very
valid feelings about snakes.

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,499
Thank you.

13
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:26,705
But I have to say we
were fairly warned.

14
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:27,884
No! No!

15
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,852
A movie should not
just be its title.

16
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,059
"Driving miss daisy" didn't
all take place in the car,

17
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,543
"Dances with wolves" wasn't
one long wolf dance.

18
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,660
But this was nothing
but snakes, snakes,

19
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:38,590
relentless snakes,
snakes on a plane.

20
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:40,256
Snakes, snakes,
snakes on a plane!

21
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,108
This was our fifth
bad movie in a row.

22
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:43,299
It's got to be some
kind of a record.

23
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,667
We got to face facts--
movies have gotten bad.

24
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,751
Unless it's our fault.

25
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:48,468
What? No,
we didn't make the bad movies.

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,250
No, we made the movies bad.
Think about it.

27
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:51,850
We are the common factor.

28
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:52,638
Ohh.

29
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:54,075
All the movies --
very different.

30
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:56,101
Different genres --
different languages, even.

31
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:58,538
We saw them in different
theaters at different times.

32
00:00:58,552 --> 00:00:59,648
What do they all
have in common?

33
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:01,050
They were all seen by us.

34
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,467
- Wow!
- Huh?

35
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:04,167
We can never see
"Casablanca" together.

36
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:05,997
I mean, I'm very sorry.
I don't care how much I love it,

37
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,403
but I will not be responsible
for ruining "Casablanca."

38
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:13,930
So...

39
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:19,397
So... we should
divvy up the candy.

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,976
- Divvy...
- The candy.

41
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,147
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:26,397
Got half the Milk Duds.

43
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,246
Sour Patch Kids --
hmm, a third.

44
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:33,081
Twizzlers -- you got about 5 --
4 3/4 -- you pick.

45
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,291
Yeah, I'll take the Twizzlers.

46
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:36,111
No, I meant besides
the Twizzlers.

47
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,364
I tell you what --
you can have it all.

48
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:40,533
Such a gentleman.

49
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:00,837
We should...

50
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,947
- Yeah, I should, uh...
- I should...

51
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:04,854
Okay.

52
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,438
Yeah.

53
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:08,498
Okay.

54
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,818
- Good night, Lor.
- Good night, Chris.

55
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:27,957
Well, well, someone is cutting
it pretty close to curfew.

56
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:28,896
Did you guys have a good time?

57
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,886
Yeah, really good.

58
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,274
Ooh, is it weird that
he didn't come in?

59
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,331
- Weird for me?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:34,797
Oh, I saw the guy two days ago.
I'm sick of him.

61
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:36,328
- Is it weird for you?
- No. No.

62
00:02:36,343 --> 00:02:38,758
Okay. He could come in
if you wanted him to.

63
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:39,964
I mean,
I could make myself scarce.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,054
Oh, no, you wouldn't have
to make yourself scarce.

65
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:45,209
Oh, then I could be un-scarce. I could
be here in all my plentiful glory.

66
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:46,066
That's more normal.

67
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,396
God, I forget what the protocol is
when your mom is dating your dad.

68
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:50,639
Yeah, me too.
We'll have to consult Emily Post again.

69
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:51,664
Yeah.

70
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,843
But I really don't
think it would be weird.

71
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:55,675
- It wouldn't?
- No. I mean, if it was,

72
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:58,406
it wouldn't be weird in a bad way.
I mean, if that's what you want.

73
00:02:58,423 --> 00:02:59,211
Okay.

74
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:00,421
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know.

75
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:02,769
No. Not now. Maybe...

76
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,061
I want it.
I don't know. Twizzler?

77
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:06,636
- Okay.
- Okay.

78
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:11,122
It's good, though. You know?

79
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,537
He and I, between us --
it's -- it's going good.

80
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:15,764
Well, good.

81
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:18,210
Yeah, when I had lunch with him the other
day, he said things were really good.

82
00:03:18,244 --> 00:03:19,198
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:20,389
What'd he say?

84
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:21,742
Um, nice things.

85
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:22,851
Oh, yeah?

86
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,635
- Yep.
- Like what?

87
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,160
Nice things.

88
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:28,589
Did he talk about my sparkling
eyes and my glossy, raven hair?

89
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,438
Look, I'm not gonna pass
notes between you guys.

90
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:32,656
What if Emily Post says that's
part of the appropriate protocol?

91
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:34,916
If you can get it in writing
from the ghost of Emily Post,

92
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:37,726
then I will pass as
many notes as you want.

93
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:40,652
- But, mom...
- Yeah?

94
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,059
I'm really glad things
are good between you.

95
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:45,171
- Me too.
- I'm just...

96
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,598
Yeah?

97
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:48,451
I just want you to be careful.

98
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,752
Is this the safe-sex talk?

99
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,805
Because even if the ghost of
Emily Post says it's okay,

100
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,033
it is just plain weird.

101
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,892
No. Mom, I want you to be
careful with you, with him.

102
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:59,104
I just...
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

103
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:01,348
I am. I am being careful.

104
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:03,783
Okay. Good.

105
00:04:04,183 --> 00:04:07,333
Oh, my gosh.
Am I coming with you to college?

106
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,121
Excuse me?

107
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:10,421
You totally want me to come
to Yale with you, don't you?

108
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,399
What? No.

109
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:14,323
Then why are you packing all of
my clothes -- my pink t-shirt?!

110
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:16,436
-  Where'd that come from?
- Oh, my goodness.

111
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,973
That is so nice of you to
think of me in school --

112
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:21,737
My sweet skirt!

113
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:23,042
I hope you brought a toothbrush

114
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,988
'cause, boy, oh, boy,
are we gonna have fun!

115
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,551
My cozy sweater...

116
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,278
Okay, two eggs over-easy,
hash browns cooked well,

117
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:27,206
whole-wheat toast buttered, and

118
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:29,671
with a side of marmalade.

119
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,941
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

120
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:33,899
All right, what can I get you?

121
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:38,609
Kirk, you're scaring
away the customers.

122
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,069
I am not gonna ask you what's wrong.
Either eat or go.

123
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,674
Women troubles, Luke.
Haven't slept in days.

124
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:47,221
See the bags under my eyes?
See the glazed look?

125
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:47,899
Women.

126
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,934
See this glazed look?
Don't care.

127
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:52,925
Mom's been incredibly possessive lately,
as has Lulu,

128
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:54,299
and it's very tense.

129
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,101
I noticed they were beginning
to snipe at each other,

130
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:58,036
but I figured it was
a friendly competition

131
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,774
I could work to my advantage,
you know?

132
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,805
When you've got two women
making you sherry cobbler,

133
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,582
you're likely to end up with
some pretty good cobbler.

134
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:04,761
Basic capitalism.

135
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:06,074
That's not how they see it.

136
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:09,574
Oh,  no. Apparently,
it's mom's cobbler or Lulu's cobbler.

137
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:11,655
- I've got to choose.
- Are you gonna order something?

138
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,478
I'd love to order something.
I'm starving.

139
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:14,724
But what should I get?

140
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:17,113
Lulu would want me to get something hip,
like a bagel.

141
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:17,767
Hip?

142
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,288
But mom would say a growing boy
needs something more substantial,

143
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:21,159
like pancakes.

144
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,367
Well, neither of them are here,
so what do you want?

145
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:27,230
I don't know!
Bagel, pancakes, bagel, pancakes...

146
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,572
It's like their voices
are blocking out my voice,

147
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,345
and I don't know what
I think anymore.

148
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,374
I'll have a bagel and pancakes,
I guess.

149
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,871
Yeah, what kind of bagel?

150
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:38,999
Lulu would kill me if I got the onion,
you know,

151
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:40,485
'cause of all the kissing --

152
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,721
and mom would freak
over the poppy seed

153
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:45,240
'cause she thinks poppies
are a gateway drug.

154
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:48,042
What about... egg?

155
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,950
Egg, it is.

156
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,811
- Hey.
- Hey.

157
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,213
I didn't expect you till later.

158
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:54,966
I know, but I wanted
to go over April's schedule

159
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,346
before I brought her by.

160
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:57,826
- Is this a good time?
- Sure, let's sit.

161
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:59,109
Great.

162
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,973
So, this is her schedule.

163
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:05,342
I think I erred on the
side of too many details.

164
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:06,706
I like details.

165
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:08,469
These are some of the phone
numbers you might need --

166
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:11,710
pediatrician, dentist, orthodontist --
if her retainer breaks --

167
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,714
- optometrist...
- If her glasses break.

168
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,381
So, my mom has her back
surgery on monday,

169
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:18,587
but, apparently,
the recovery process is really slow,

170
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:20,668
so I'm gonna be in New
Mexico at least two weeks.

171
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:24,074
It's fine. April can stay with
me as long as you need her to.

172
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,911
Thanks. I really
appreciate this.

173
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,152
- All right, so what's this packet?
- Right.

174
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,773
Registration forms,
some waivers --

175
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:33,972
April will need to have this when
she goes to school tomorrow.

176
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:36,473
And she will tell you she
needs to be there at 7:30,

177
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,871
but she really doesn't need
to be there until 8:00.

178
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:40,548
Anyway, it's all in the notes.

179
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,900
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

180
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,313
Okay, maybe a little.

181
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:47,463
It'll be fine?

182
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:50,199
It will be fine. I promise.

183
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:54,272
Wow! Today's secret
ingredient is gourds!

184
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:55,626
Aren't they beautiful?

185
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,590
I guess that depends
on the beholder's eye.

186
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:59,875
Jackson's whole squash
crop went crazy this year.

187
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,062
We had such a hot summer,

188
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:03,047
and these babies love the sun.

189
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,314
You've got to try this soup.

190
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:05,639
Wait, is that gourd soup?

191
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,891
It's so good.
It's sweet and rich.

192
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:09,523
It's like pie, only it's soup.

193
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:10,720
It's like pie soup!

194
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:12,082
No, I don't eat orange food,

195
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:13,846
- except for candy corn.
- You eat cheetos.

196
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,190
I don't eat food that's
naturally orange.

197
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:16,026
You eat oranges.

198
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,404
I eat food that's naturally orange,
but I don't eat gourds.

199
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:19,438
Fine.

200
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:20,780
What else is going on at home?

201
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:24,205
Ooh! Martha is so close to walking.
She's right on the verge.

202
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:26,431
Why don't you come over
tomorrow night for dinner?

203
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:28,579
Maybe you'll see
the inaugural steps.

204
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,659
Um, I'd love to, but...

205
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:33,989
But you want to wait to see if
Christopher calls and asks you out first,

206
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:35,750
and then if he doesn't,
you'll come over.

207
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:37,219
Something like that, yes.

208
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,377
You two have been seeing quite
a bit of each other lately.

209
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,720
Yeah, we're just dating.

210
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,066
Right, 'cause you can just
date the father of your child.

211
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,044
Turns out you can.

212
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,746
It's been a fun six weeks.
We're taking things slowly

213
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:50,855
And just getting to
know each other again.

214
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:54,050
Except for the fact that you've known
each other for more than 30 years.

215
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,992
Okay, I get it. Please get off my back,
and stop talking like this.

216
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:02,067
Okay, it's just that you and Luke
haven't been broken up all that long.

217
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,347
I know. I remember.
I was there.

218
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:10,528
Okay.  It's -- you know, after
breaking up out of a big relationship

219
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,530
it's normal to have
a rebound thing.

220
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:15,859
You know, a big, bouncy,
rubber ball of a rebound thing.

221
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,738
- It's... good.
- But?

222
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:20,415
But a rubber ball is
a 28-year-old surfer

223
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:23,494
or a jazz saxophonist
who drives a V.W. bus

224
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:25,384
or a really cute guy that
can't even spell his last name.

225
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:27,366
It's not the father
of your only child.

226
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,120
Christopher is not
your rubber ball.

227
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:30,907
Okay.

228
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,180
He's a big, heavy bowling ball.

229
00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:34,569
I'm gonna tell
him you said that.

230
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:35,786
I just want you to be careful.

231
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:38,510
Okay, God, I feel like I should
set up traffic cones around me

232
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,054
for all the people
worrying about my safety.

233
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:43,212
I am being careful, okay?

234
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:44,027
That's all I want.

235
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,367
- All right.
- Great.

236
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:46,240
- Fine.
- Good.

237
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:47,461
- Good.
- Better.

238
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:48,791
Hi, Chris.

239
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,576
So Lor, what's your life
looking like tomorrow night?

240
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:51,507
You available?

241
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,899
Well, I don't know,
is there some particular reason

242
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,843
you're checking
my availability?

243
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,662
Well, I have an idea
for a really fun date,

244
00:09:58,677 --> 00:10:00,406
and if, in fact,
you are available,

245
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,334
I will put thought into action.

246
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,145
I thought our last
date was pretty fun.

247
00:10:04,162 --> 00:10:05,472
Well, this will
be even more fun.

248
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,331
"Snakes on a boat"?!

249
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,336
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

250
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:11,656
Okay,  I'll be there at
6:00 to be picked up.

251
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:16,231
Sorry. These gourd
rinds are really thick.

252
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:17,872
What is the, uh, fun date?

253
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:18,962
No hints.

254
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,334
I hate not knowing things.

255
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,233
I know. I'll see you tomorrow.

256
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,904
Okay. Bye.

257
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:25,976
Sounds like somebody's
got a date.

258
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,731
- Sookie.
- Sorry.

259
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:29,600
- Sounds like somebody's got a date.
- Nice.

260
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:01,030
Hey, this is Logan Huntzberger.
Leave a message.

261
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:02,860
Hey, it's me.

262
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:04,789
I just got back to Yale.

263
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:07,563
I thought I would try you
and see if you're there,

264
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:09,057
but you're not.

265
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,165
I thought you would be,
but you're not.

266
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,465
Fascinating, my thought process,
isn't it?

267
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:16,958
Okay, I'll talk to
you later. Bye.

268
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:22,428
Hey!

269
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,912
Well, hello, Rory.
You sound chipper.

270
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:26,512
Oh, hi, grandpa.

271
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:27,846
You're back at Yale?

272
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,801
Yep. Back at Yale.

273
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,087
Tell her the good
news, Richard!

274
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,188
I'm coming to that.

275
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:35,020
- It's very exciting!
- What's exciting?

276
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:37,196
Well, when I was at my
Yale class reunion,

277
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,165
I had a chance to meet one of my
former classmates, Harold Laken.

278
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,909
You know him as the dean of
undergraduate education.

279
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:45,636
Harold was also a
fellow Whiffenpoof.

280
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,550
- The news, Richard!
- Yes, right. Well...

281
00:11:48,565 --> 00:11:52,396
It seems there was a sudden vacancy
in the economics department,

282
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,938
and they need someone to
teach a course this semester,

283
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:57,431
and Harold immediately
thought of me.

284
00:11:57,445 --> 00:12:00,013
Can you believe it?
Your grandfather, a professor!

285
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,822
I'm just a visiting lecturer.

286
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,801
Too starchy. Too starchy?

287
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,006
- No, I like -- I like --
- Too starchy.

288
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,969
What I want to know is whether
you'd be okay with this.

289
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:10,771
I'm gonna be on the campus
at the same time you are,

290
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:12,882
and there's a chance we
might run into one another.

291
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:14,782
I promise,
you will not cramp my style.

292
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:17,055
Well, that's wonderful,
because I have to admit,

293
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,818
I'm really quite
excited about it.

294
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,677
That's great,
grandpa. Congratulations.

295
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,884
Well, why don't we meet
up after your first class

296
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:24,869
and grab dinner and celebrate?

297
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,338
Oh, I would love that,

298
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:28,992
but I've already scheduled
dinner with Harold.

299
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,975
But, Richard, we have dinner
with the Sudburys on thursday.

300
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:33,432
Remember? We're going
to the Hill House.

301
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:35,879
Well, I'm sorry, Emily,
but I have dinner with the dean,

302
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:38,316
and you can't expect me to
include the Sudburys in that.

303
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:39,743
They are insufferable bores.

304
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:41,116
No, of course not.

305
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:43,541
I'll just have to have dinner
with the Sudburys alone.

306
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:46,007
Oh, the life of
a faculty widow!

307
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,329
Did you hear that, Rory?
She's already turned on me.

308
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,842
I heard it, grandpa.

309
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:53,450
Razor blades? They've expressly
forbidden razor blades?

310
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:54,610
That's sound policy.

311
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:56,768
Are kids at this school
showing up with razor blades?

312
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:58,983
I mean, listen to this list
of stuff they've had to ban.

313
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:02,138
Drug use, bullying, graffiti,
theft, spitting, fighting --

314
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:05,897
including but not limited to punching,
kicking, gouging, and biting.

315
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:07,758
Seems to me like they're
just giving the kids ideas.

316
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,839
"Gee, I can't think of any
other bad things to do today.

317
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,898
Let me look at the manual.
Hey, gouging sounds fun!"

318
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:15,105
No one at that school
is gouging anyone.

319
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:17,712
Well, sure. Why bother with
that when they've got access to

320
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,996
guns, tasers, knives,
and nunchucks?

321
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:22,509
Nunchucks are cool --
and deadly.

322
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:25,041
That's ridiculous. Nobody's bringing
nunchucks to April's school.

323
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,354
Of course not.

324
00:13:26,368 --> 00:13:27,937
They're way too bulky
to fit in your sock.

325
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:29,520
- Now, mace, on the other hand --
- Mace?

326
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,623
Kids are walking
around with mace?

327
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:33,096
Oh, honey, calm down.
Nothing's gonna happen to April.

328
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,820
They just spell out that stuff
for their legal protection.

329
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,420
Whenever you're taking care of kids,
that's a lot of liability.

330
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,905
It's the same with
my dance school.

331
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,354
And nothing bad ever happens?

332
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,648
Nothing ever happens.

333
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,642
Oh, except for that one time.

334
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:45,977
What one time?

335
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,500
Well, I took my
senior ballerinas

336
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:49,600
to try out for a performance
of "The nutcracker,"

337
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:51,501
and one of the girls
pulled a Tonya Harding

338
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:54,022
and knocked the front-runner for
Clara out of the competition.

339
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:55,547
Broke her leg in three places.

340
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,176
That is not nothing.
That is the opposite of nothing.

341
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:01,149
It's totally different.
That was a much rougher crowd.

342
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:03,019
Rougher crowd?
They're ballerinas.

343
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,263
Oh, yeah. I know.

344
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,466
Everyone thinks, "ballerinas --
so sweet, so fragile."

345
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,627
Trust me,
they're dancing on stress fractures

346
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,934
and ingrown toenails,
and they haven't eaten in weeks.

347
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,403
- Hey.
- Sorry we're late.

348
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,717
We were half-way here
and April remembered

349
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:18,322
the avocado pit was still in the
kitchen, so we had to go back.

350
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:20,454
We had to make to
make a pit stop.

351
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,245
- Hey, honey.
- Hi!

352
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,089
- You remember miss Patty.
- Sure!

353
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:25,315
- And Kirk.
- Yo.

354
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:26,410
- And Caesar.
- Hey, April.

355
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:28,635
I hate to have to rush,
but I actually have to rush.

356
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:29,948
That's fine. You go.

357
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:32,202
- Bye, mom.
- Ooh, I love you, sweetie.

358
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,488
- Say hi to grandma.
- I will.

359
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:35,665
- I'll call you when I get there.
- Okay.

360
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:36,736
Take care of her.

361
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:37,822
I will.

362
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:39,488
Okay, then.

363
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,840
So, is there somewhere
I can put the pit down?

364
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:48,448
Oh, you know what?
Go on upstairs, and I'll bring the bags.

365
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:53,990
Look at that turnout.
And the hips of Anna Pavlova.

366
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:56,282
You must bring her
to my ballet class.

367
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:58,787
Where ballerinas are maiming each
other to be in "The nutcracker"?

368
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:00,887
Fat chance of that.

369
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:06,161
Okay, here we are.

370
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:07,877
You remember the place.

371
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,392
All right.

372
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,653
Here's your bed,
and here's the desk.

373
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:14,130
I thought you could do
your homework on it.

374
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,402
A little chair for reading.
I know how you like reading.

375
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,360
And this is your dresser.

376
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,594
Now, if you have a hanging bag for,
like, dresses,

377
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:23,492
you can just hang it in my closet,
but I don't seem to remember

378
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:25,659
- you wearing a lot of dresses.
- Not big on dresses.

379
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:29,168
All right, what else?
Here's your kitchen, my bed,

380
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:31,835
bathroom's back there,
and the TV.

381
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,465
I had a remote but I lost it,

382
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:36,822
so you're gonna have to change the
channel by turning this knob here.

383
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,469
And here's the telephone.

384
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:41,510
If you're on it and you hear a
beeping sound, that's call-waiting,

385
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,771
So you've got to hit the flash button
to switch over to the other call.

386
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:46,279
Maybe I should
write all this down.

387
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,226
Oh, sure! Sure!

388
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,642
I was just kidding.
I know how call-waiting works.

389
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,284
Of course you do.

390
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:54,554
You probably also know how to open up
a refrigerator and turn on a sink.

391
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,662
Okay, well,
I'll get out of your way,

392
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,494
and you let me know if
you need anything. Okay?

393
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:01,507
Actually, my avocado
pit needs light,

394
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:04,124
and it's kind of dark in here.

395
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:06,427
Well, there will be a little
more light in the morning.

396
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:08,900
Will there be less
brown in the morning?

397
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:12,018
You know, this place is kind
of depressing, isn't it?

398
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,842
I'd say.

399
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:15,910
Sorry if that hurt
your feelings.

400
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:19,748
Mom says bluntness isn't my
most attractive quality.

401
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:21,770
Well, maybe we can
pick up a few things.

402
00:16:21,784 --> 00:16:23,604
I don't know,
some pillows, a rug.

403
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,233
You know, lamps --
lamps brighten.

404
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:26,654
Hey, we could go to "targ�t."

405
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:28,109
Oh, sounds kind of fancy.

406
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:29,865
No. No,
that's just how we say "Target."

407
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,562
Oh, never been.

408
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:34,038
Wow. Um...

409
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:36,646
I don't think I've ever met a
person who hasn't been to Target.

410
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,074
Well, now you have,
so if you say that's the place to go,

411
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:41,144
- so that's where we'll go.
- It's the place to go.

412
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,762
Okay, so how about tomorrow,
after I close up?

413
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:44,778
- Cool.
- Cool!

414
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,494
- I'll let you get settled in.
- Okay.

415
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:47,808
All right.

416
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:01,266
Everyone, congratulations.

417
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,419
The first issue of the year
is officially locked down.

418
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,848
And special kudos to Bill
for landing the front page

419
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:08,859
with his campus housing expos�,

420
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,499
"Dormitory or death trap?"

421
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:11,470
Nice alliteration.

422
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:12,716
Slugline's half the battle.

423
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:14,979
Dormitory renovations --
that's quaint.

424
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:17,711
I recently had the opportunity to be a
fly on the wall at the Hartford courant

425
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,686
as the editor selected
their lead story.

426
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:22,084
It was down to the wire,
and I was on the edge of my seat

427
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:24,666
when at the last second,
a local-corruption story broke.

428
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:27,006
It was thrilling.
It made this place look like a joke.

429
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,989
- Your point, Paris?
- Oh, I thought I was clear.

430
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:31,013
Compared to the courant,
this place is a joke.

431
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,443
Okay. Assignments.

432
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:34,591
Bill, you'll go with part two
of the campus-housing series.

433
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:35,195
Got it.

434
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,153
We need someone to cover the
board of trustees meeting.

435
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:38,602
- I'm on that.
- Thanks, Joni.

436
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:41,661
And I want to do the traditional
freshman class composition article,

437
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:44,490
but I think we need to go deeper
than just ethnicities and hometowns.

438
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:46,848
I mean,
what is the class of 2010 really about?

439
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:48,239
Maybe take a different look.

440
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:51,317
At the courant, they use indesign to
integrate the words into the photos.

441
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,159
Gee, Paris, do you happen to
have an "in" at the courant?

442
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:54,857
Like, maybe your
boyfriend, Doyle?

443
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:56,018
What is he, a fact-checker?

444
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,204
The most requested
fact-checker at the paper.

445
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:00,284
He works seven days a week just
to keep up with the demand

446
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:01,378
for his fact-checking.

447
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:03,488
Maybe he's looking to get
away from a certain lunatic.

448
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:04,725
Jealous much, Sheila?

449
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,190
Yeah. You got me.

450
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:08,896
So, the art-show piece.
I've got a problem.

451
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,345
Animal, vegetable, or mineral?

452
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,734
I kind of had a thing with one
of the artists in the show.

453
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:13,748
Okay. Animal.

454
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:14,844
I just can't do it.

455
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:16,127
That's fine. I can do it.

456
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,486
That's it. Class dismissed.

457
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,940
So, you want to go to this
art-show thing with me tonight?

458
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,163
Sorry, can't, Doyle's celebrating his
one-month anniversary with the paper.

459
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:26,303
Having drinks with a bunch of the
staff bigwigs over at Duffy's.

460
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:27,512
- Cool.
- Yeah.

461
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:29,524
He's pretty loved.
Actually, we both are.

462
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:31,337
We're like the Ephron and
Bernstein of the group.

463
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,883
I think it's going
to be quite a fete.

464
00:18:32,898 --> 00:18:35,223
Doyle says the editor of the
metro section might even show.

465
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:36,909
That's cool.
Well, I can just go by myself.

466
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:39,587
You know, if you're desperate, you could
force one of these staffers to go with you.

467
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,224
I used to do that all the
time when I was the editor.

468
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,347
I dragged Bill everywhere.

469
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:44,467
That is, until the time I picked
him up to go to the groundbreaking

470
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:45,800
for the new chemistry
research building,

471
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,288
and he was wearing
a cable-knit sweater

472
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:49,962
that had "date" written all over it.
As if.

473
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,304
I'm not desperate.

474
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,646
Look, don't give me those
Rory Gilmore puppy-dog eyes.

475
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:56,502
Even if I am your best friend,
I have to look out for my career first,

476
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,009
then Doyle's, then you.

477
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,033
Go to your party, Paris.

478
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:00,942
Be the couple whose
divorce was so painful

479
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,850
that it was memorialized in both
literature and film. I'll be fine.

480
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:06,478
Oh, yeah. Now it's just sad.

481
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:16,814
Huh!

482
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,874
Um... kind of, uh, casual,

483
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,003
seemingly routine
dating clothes.

484
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:23,636
Was that intended
as a compliment?

485
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,552
'Cause it didn't
come out like one.

486
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:26,817
No, you look good.

487
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,024
But I mean, how hard is it to look
good when you know where you're going?

488
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:31,192
- Not that hard.
- I could get some points.

489
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:32,929
I, on the other hand,
had to come up with an outfit

490
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:35,393
that could easily convert from
totally formal to totally casual

491
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:37,137
with just a few moves.

492
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:38,547
Look, here I am, all ready

493
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:41,116
for an elegant,
New York night on the town,

494
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:42,909
carriage ride through the park,

495
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:45,175
dinner at Pastis,
drinks at the Algonquin,

496
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,542
but if I change my shoes
and throw on a cardigan

497
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:49,875
and add necklace number two,

498
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,348
then I am ready for a concert
at the New Haven Green,

499
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:54,946
or I could use my cardigan to
cover up the security camera

500
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,373
in case the date turns
into some sort of heist.

501
00:19:57,386 --> 00:19:59,120
I'd prefer the sexy
shoes to the sandals,

502
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:00,614
but you should be comfortable.

503
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,110
Comfortable?

504
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:04,902
"Comfortable" like we're gonna
eat moroccan and sit on the floor,

505
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,528
or "comfortable" like
we're gonna go up steps?

506
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:10,120
Steps? Steps? Steps?
Are we going to the Mets?

507
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,789
No hints.

508
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,157
So, tell me now.

509
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,740
Now! Tell me!

510
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:18,444
Oh, hello, "Bullitt."
Are you taking me on a car chase

511
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,833
through the streets
of San Francisco?

512
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,118
- It's cool, right?
- It's really cool.

513
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,271
- You like it?
- I love it.

514
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:24,458
- So is this the thing?
- It's a thing.

515
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:26,328
But is this the special
thing you planned?

516
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,016
'Cause if it is,
I want to give it its due.

517
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:30,318
If it's not, I want to have
the proper level of enjoyment

518
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,858
while still reserving myself
for the actual special thing.

519
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:34,796
The car is part of the thing.
It's not the whole thing.

520
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:35,925
I don't want to peek too soon.

521
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:36,895
Yeah, that's never good.

522
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,671
Ooh, you're being a gentleman.
Is that the special thing?

523
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,673
I always open your door.

524
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,822
Bucket seats --
is that the special thing?

525
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:44,816
No? Take a good,
long look at my hair now

526
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:47,762
'cause it's not gonna look like
this for the rest of the night.

527
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,425
Rumbly engine --
is that the special thing?

528
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,604
Buckle your seatbelt.

529
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:54,579
Buckling my seatbelt --
is that the special thing?

530
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,948
Yeah, that's it.
You're all buckled up. Date's over.

531
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:02,099
Look at this --
12-pack of socks for $6.

532
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:05,771
24 socks for 6 bucks.
That's only 25 cents a sock..

533
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:06,941
I knew you'd like it.

534
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,266
Oh, this looks good.

535
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,261
- You picked it out.
- Well, you said tablecloth.

536
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:11,182
That's true.

537
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:12,602
And what's the name
of that blue again?

538
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:15,028
Uh, cerulean.
I'm really into cerulean.

539
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,464
Yeah, I can see why.

540
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,224
I used to be really into olive.
Everything was olive, you know?

541
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:23,046
It was my backpack, my pants,
my sneakers. It was all olive.

542
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,143
And then one day, I just --
I woke up,

543
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,472
and I was like, "olive?
I don't like olive.

544
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:31,667
Not to wear, not to eat.
Olive -- Bleh."

545
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:34,129
Well, you know what?
I'm really glad we did it.

546
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:36,326
We had fun,
and the place looks great.

547
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:38,263
And, you know, now,
anytime you want,

548
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:41,046
you can have a nice
dinner on this table.

549
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,255
That's true.

550
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,871
You could put
flowers in this vase

551
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,696
- and use it like a centerpiece.
- Uh-huh.

552
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:50,164
You could dim the lights,
light these candles.

553
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:52,325
You know,
we can do it tonight if you want.

554
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:53,419
Yeah.

555
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:57,303
Or, you know, you could do it
when you have a lady over.

556
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,316
Oh?

557
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:01,071
It'd be really nice.

558
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,620
And she would be totally
comfortable in here now.

559
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,324
Right. Uh, you know what?

560
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:08,157
Why don't we, uh,
set up the desk lamp

561
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:09,671
so you can get at
your homework?

562
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:11,570
Actually, they don't give homework
on the first day of school.

563
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:13,249
One teacher said he was
gonna give us homework.

564
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:15,553
He even wrote it on the board,
but the homework was just,

565
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:17,912
"cover your books."
How lame is that?

566
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:19,560
- Very lame.
- I know.

567
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:22,036
So I'll set it up so you
can get to it tomorrow.

568
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:24,086
Cool. Um,
I'm gonna start covering my books.

569
00:22:24,103 --> 00:22:25,526
Can I grab some grocery bags?

570
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,454
Yeah, go for it.
It's under the sink.

571
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:38,405
You know,
you can admit it if you're lost.

572
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,980
I will not lose any
respect for you.

573
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,560
I'm not lost.

574
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:43,306
Well, then,
are you planning to murder me?

575
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,003
Because people will
notice I'm gone.

576
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:46,214
They'll look for me.

577
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:48,819
Paul Anka saw me leave with you.
He'll bark.

578
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:51,294
He will bark,
and he'll sell you down the river.

579
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:53,691
Chris! Chris!

580
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,921
Good. Finally asking
for directions.

581
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:00,617
We're here.

582
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,724
Here, where? Are we at Woodstock?
I think we're late.

583
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:06,101
Shh! Just give it a minute.

584
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:09,105
Oh, are we meditating?
I think you need a word to repeat.

585
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:10,139
I don't have a word.

586
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,138
Stop talking.

587
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:12,357
That's two words.

588
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,534
Shh.

589
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:14,648
Oh.

590
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:16,018
"Shh." I like it.

591
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:17,565
Shh...

592
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:19,837
Ooh! What the --

593
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:41,742
I love this movie.

594
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,626
Check the glove compartment.

595
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,281
Oh, my god.

596
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:49,961
Hold this.

597
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,712
And...

598
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:54,795
popcorn.

599
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,364
Oh, my god.
You're unbelievable!

600
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:00,815
I thought it was time we saw a
movie we wouldn't complain about.

601
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:13,908
"Good morning, Mr. Ascot."

602
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:20,045
Mm-hmm.
But I have to tell you, Emily,

603
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:22,231
it's a whole new world
from the one we remember.

604
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:23,959
But the jacket was
still appropriate?

605
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:25,385
Oh, the jacket was fine.

606
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:27,612
Although I must say,
I felt wildly overdressed.

607
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:30,910
Boys in undershirts and
filthy baseball caps --

608
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:33,125
the girls wearing
pajamas and flip-flops.

609
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,949
Well, it's the style, Richard.

610
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:36,492
Well, it's most peculiar.

611
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,832
And you were firm with them?
That's one thing that never changes.

612
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:40,800
Young people respond
to discipline.

613
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:43,290
After all, you don't want your
course to be known as a "gut."

614
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:44,529
That's an easy class.

615
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,610
I learned that term at
dinner with the Sudburys,

616
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,386
who learned it from
their grandson, Paul.

617
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:52,028
And how are the Sudburys?
I hope you gave them my regards.

618
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:54,675
Of course. And they sent you theirs
and then proceeded to bore me

619
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,303
with the details of every
stunning vista they witnessed

620
00:24:57,317 --> 00:24:59,268
on their recent
cruise to Alaska.

621
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:02,972
If you ask me, they saw more of the
baked Alaska than anything else.

622
00:25:03,225 --> 00:25:05,952
You poor thing.
You have a disappointing evening,

623
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:07,355
and I have to give
you the bum's rush

624
00:25:07,388 --> 00:25:09,734
to make my dinner with
Harold at the faculty club.

625
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,516
That's all right.
You enjoy yourself.

626
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:13,742
I probably won't wait up,
so I'll say good night now.

627
00:25:13,757 --> 00:25:15,574
Good night, dear.

628
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:24,798
Oh, for Pete's sake! What now?

629
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:37,680
License and
registration, please?

630
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:39,903
Why do you need to see my license?
I wasn't speeding.

631
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,379
You were on a cellphone, ma'am.

632
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:42,713
I don't see how
that's your concern.

633
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:44,420
Do my bills go to your office?

634
00:25:44,437 --> 00:25:46,625
It is illegal in Connecticut
to talk on a cellphone

635
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,133
while operating a vehicle.

636
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,430
Well, that is absurd. I can't talk
on my own phone in my own car?

637
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:53,540
License and
registration, ma'am.

638
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,465
If I can manage to drink a
cup of hot coffee and drive,

639
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:57,925
I can talk on a cellphone.

640
00:25:57,937 --> 00:25:59,489
Or is coffee illegal, too?

641
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:00,736
Can I listen to the radio?

642
00:26:00,747 --> 00:26:02,069
Can I open the
glove compartment?

643
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,417
Perhaps you should outlaw
scratching your nose.

644
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,922
That would certainly
cut down on accidents.

645
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,550
Ma'am, have you been drinking?

646
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,554
What? No!

647
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,031
This is outrageous.

648
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:14,239
You know, right now,
someone is robbing a kwiki mart,

649
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:16,519
and you're standing
there harassing me.

650
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:19,904
I'm going to need you to blow
into this breathalyzer for me.

651
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,110
Young man,
I don't know where that's been,

652
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:24,815
but I can say with
absolute certainty

653
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:27,951
it won't be going
anywhere near my mouth.

654
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,160
Excuse me. Do you know what
the light bulbs are all about?

655
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:51,669
Shock in your system.

656
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:53,368
Effective.

657
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:05,605
What are you doing?

658
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,098
Um, me?

659
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:08,300
She's touching your art.

660
00:27:08,313 --> 00:27:11,213
What are you doing?
Are you actually drinking that water?

661
00:27:11,227 --> 00:27:13,649
Oh, um,
I didn't know that it was art.

662
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:15,885
I thought it was
just a water cooler.

663
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,293
There's no sign or anything.

664
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:18,434
"Just a water cooler."

665
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,670
That's her self-portrait.

666
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:23,795
I'm kidding!
It's just a water cooler.

667
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,774
Oh. Okay.

668
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,799
We were just messing with you.
She is an artist, though.

669
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:27,804
I made the horse.

670
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:29,311
Oh, I really like that one.

671
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:30,357
Well, thanks.

672
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:32,640
Yes. It looks really big, too.
It looks bigger than the doorway.

673
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:34,001
Yeah. Well, it turns out it is,

674
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:36,301
as I found out four hours
before the show gonna start.

675
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:38,941
I had to detach the head,
then reattach it when I got here.

676
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:40,284
Does it look crooked?

677
00:27:40,296 --> 00:27:41,308
Um, not to me.

678
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:42,708
- No, it does.
- If it does look crooked,

679
00:27:42,743 --> 00:27:45,989
which it doesn't, I think it looks
better then it did before -- more jaunty.

680
00:27:46,002 --> 00:27:46,978
What's it made out of?

681
00:27:46,992 --> 00:27:49,163
Cans mostly. Tinfoil.
A couple hubcaps.

682
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:50,534
I do stuff with found objects.

683
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,836
I mean, you could call it trash,
but that'd be kind of negative.

684
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,391
She once made this
sculpture of an old lady

685
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,135
out of plastic sandwich
bags and milk cartons,

686
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:57,556
which was so cool.
She's awesome.

687
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,678
Oh, shut up!

688
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:00,277
So you're Olivia Marquont?

689
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:02,560
- Impressive.
- What are you, a spy?

690
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:04,602
Actually, I'm here for the paper.
I'm Rory.

691
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:06,984
Oh, the press.
So what do you think?

692
00:28:06,996 --> 00:28:09,477
Honestly, I don't know.
I like your piece,

693
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,680
and I think I like the
robot in the underpants.

694
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:12,909
The robot is genius.

695
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:14,608
Olivia thinks
everything is genius.

696
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:15,670
Only genius stuff.

697
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:17,005
So, you're on the paper?

698
00:28:17,018 --> 00:28:18,404
Oh, my god,
we used to be totally obsessed

699
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:20,601
with this girl who was on the paper --
Paris Geller.

700
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,011
- Sure.
- You know Paris?

701
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,764
- I know Paris.
- Okay, freshman year,

702
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:25,781
we were in this moral-reasoning
class with Paris,

703
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,255
and she was the most intense
person we'd ever met.

704
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,326
Um, she's pretty much
like that all the time.

705
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,686
Actually, I went to
high school with Paris.

706
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:34,064
Paris geller is a genius,
and I will go to the mat on that one.

707
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:36,138
Okay, you've got to let us
show you the rest of the show.

708
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:36,923
That's cool.

709
00:28:36,938 --> 00:28:38,274
Come on.
We'll help you with your article,

710
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:40,308
give you the skinny
on everyone.

711
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:42,149
Did you see the
light bulb thing?

712
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,009
Um, my retinas
are still ringing.

713
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:46,255
Our friend Joel did that.
He just transferred from M.I.T.

714
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:48,776
Dude's wicked smart.
His work is always about technology.

715
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,024
I think Joel's a genius,

716
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:53,122
but I'll admit, I could be biased
by the fact that he's a total fox.

717
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:55,164
Is that the guy in
the '70s prom tuxedo?

718
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,698
No, that's Elijah.
He's doing a performance piece, actually.

719
00:28:57,709 --> 00:29:00,364
He's been doing it since we were juniors.
Who knows if it'll ever end?

720
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:02,394
Okay, you've got to see
our friend Kasha's piece.

721
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,320
It's called "Girl without
clothes," and it's far out.

722
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:07,496
# You can't blame me #

723
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:11,735
# For feeling avarice #

724
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:15,698
# Oh, s'wonderful #

725
00:29:15,846 --> 00:29:19,810
# S'marvelous #

726
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:24,129
# That you should care #

727
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:28,442
# For me #

728
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:49,272
Ooh, it's so good!

729
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:52,706
It's so chock-full of...
words like "chock-full."

730
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:54,262
And even if Audrey
Hepburn was 20

731
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:56,792
- and Fred Astaire was, like, 80 --
- He's still Fred Astaire.

732
00:29:56,806 --> 00:29:59,478
I mean,
he could really tap-dance.

733
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:01,222
That was so nice, Chris.

734
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:04,073
That was so romantic
and fun and wonderful.

735
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,183
- S'wonderful?
- S'marvelous.

736
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:08,655
- I'm glad you liked it.
- I did. I really liked it.

737
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:10,719
You know,
the evening doesn't have to end here.

738
00:30:10,731 --> 00:30:13,328
Gigi's staying with my mom.
We could go back to my place.

739
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:15,686
Oh. That's nice.

740
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:19,818
- Nice?
- No, that's not what I meant. Um...

741
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:21,373
- We don't have to.
- No, I want to.

742
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,579
- You do?
- I do, but I don't know if...

743
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:25,191
- ...you want to.
- ...if I should.

744
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,716
Okay.

745
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:31,348
I mean, everything's good, you know?
It's going really good.

746
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,204
- It's really good.
- Yeah, and I'm feeling good.

747
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:35,815
But?

748
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:40,880
I don't, uh...
know if I trust you.

749
00:30:41,518 --> 00:30:42,740
Really?

750
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:46,038
Not just you. Me too.

751
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:50,932
I'm not sure if I
trust us yet with this.

752
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:52,560
Oh.

753
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,897
It's scary.

754
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:58,096
I'm scared, too.

755
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,980
I just hoped maybe...

756
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:05,278
we could stay here in this
place for a little while longer.

757
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:07,408
Well, it's gonna
snow eventually.

758
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:08,834
Right.

759
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,434
It's fine. We should wait.

760
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:12,804
I can wait.

761
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:14,790
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

762
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:18,194
Thank you.

763
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:21,330
All this is perfect.

764
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,891
Okay.

765
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:35,073
Hello?

766
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,363
This is she.

767
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:39,804
What?

768
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,701
Oh. Yes!

769
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:43,372
What is it?
Who are you talking to?

770
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:45,923
Is she okay? What did she --

771
00:31:46,922 --> 00:31:49,834
Okay. Where are you?

772
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,039
Uh-huh. I know where that is.

773
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:54,975
I'll be right there. Thank you.

774
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,480
Okay, bye-bye.

775
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:57,508
What?

776
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,067
We have to go.
We have to pick up my mother --

777
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,967
from jail.

778
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:04,642
Your mother's in jail?

779
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,866
Ooh, this night keeps
getting better and better.

780
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,220
Let's go.

781
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:21,204
You brush your teeth?

782
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,347
They're brushed.

783
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,723
So, there's a clear
path to the bathroom.

784
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:26,181
Can I get you a night-light?

785
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,918
I'm 13.

786
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:29,396
I'll take that as a "no."

787
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:30,679
I thought you didn't
have any homework.

788
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:32,358
I don't.
This is more for pleasure.

789
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:35,103
Sure. Sure,
a little light reading before bed.

790
00:32:35,117 --> 00:32:37,019
I love my biology teacher.

791
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:39,540
She is so smart,
and she's really pretty.

792
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:41,554
She has this long, brown hair

793
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:43,600
that she kind of just
whooshes up into a clip.

794
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:45,477
She has all these piercings,
but it's just on one ear,

795
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:47,164
and she likes to fish.

796
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:49,920
No kidding?
A pretty fisher/scientist woman.

797
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:51,308
And I know she's single

798
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:53,257
because last year her
name was Mrs. Johnson,

799
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:55,885
and this year it's Ms.
Kaplan, so I was thinking,

800
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:58,760
one day, I could conveniently
forget my biology book,

801
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,373
and you could
bring it by for me,

802
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:03,124
and then maybe you could...

803
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:05,655
Have dinner at the candlestick
table with Ms. Kaplan?

804
00:33:05,672 --> 00:33:07,421
Exactly.

805
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,463
Look...

806
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:11,287
April...

807
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:14,777
I guess you know
Lorelai and I broke up.

808
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,203
Yeah, my mom sort of told me.

809
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:19,362
Okay, well,
sometimes that happens, you know?

810
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:22,036
Sometimes it doesn't
work out between people,

811
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,666
and it's nobody's fault.

812
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,555
It's all about pheromones.

813
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:26,967
Right.

814
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:29,701
But I want you to
know I'm okay,

815
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:31,552
and you don't have
to take care of me.

816
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:33,649
I'm here to take care of you.

817
00:33:33,664 --> 00:33:35,128
Okay?

818
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,950
Okay.

819
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,652
- Good night.
- Good night.

820
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:43,472
Is it okay if I read a little
more before I turn out the light?

821
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:44,949
- Real page-turner, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

822
00:33:44,962 --> 00:33:46,846
Mitosis is insane.

823
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,775
Knock yourself out.

824
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:55,042
Oh... got it! Thank you!

825
00:33:55,404 --> 00:33:57,228
- Am I smiling too much?
- You're smiling a lot.

826
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,744
All right,
I'll try to bring it down a notch.

827
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:00,442
Well, it's about time.
Oh, good.

828
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,985
I get to walk this
filthy floor again.

829
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,478
I don't need any help walking.
Thank you!

830
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:07,615
Oh, thank you for giving me
things that already belong to me.

831
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,197
Well, you can all be very
proud of yourselves.

832
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:11,510
You're doing a crack job.

833
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:14,232
You finally got menace-to-society
Emily Gilmore off the streets.

834
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:15,951
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

835
00:34:15,963 --> 00:34:18,144
Come on. Put that thing away.

836
00:34:18,162 --> 00:34:19,823
One, two, three! Ah!

837
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,550
Smile! Cheese!

838
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:24,868
Oh, I got you already. I'll get --
Okay, later. Bye!

839
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,605
Do you mind if I turn
on the music, mom?

840
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:30,776
That's fine.

841
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,875
Whatcha in the mood for?
"Jailhouse rock"?

842
00:34:32,892 --> 00:34:34,036
"Folsom prison blues"?

843
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:35,362
You're very funny, Lorelai.

844
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,065
No, no, no. I know, I know.
"Working on the chain gang."

845
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,041
Yes, it's all quite amusing,
isn't it?

846
00:34:40,055 --> 00:34:42,199
My being arrested,
held behind bars,

847
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,643
manhandled, and patted down?
Hardee-har.

848
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,928
Aw. I just have one
question for you, mom.

849
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,596
Why on earth did you call me?

850
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:50,897
I mean, thank you very much
from the bottom of my heart

851
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,258
for that incredible gift.

852
00:34:52,272 --> 00:34:54,292
You don't need to get me anything
for the next five Christmases.

853
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,191
But why did you call me,
not dad?

854
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:58,138
It was his first night
teaching at Yale.

855
00:34:58,152 --> 00:34:59,394
He was having dinner
with the dean.

856
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:01,371
I'm not about to call him
so he can excuse himself

857
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:03,797
to come bail his
wife out of jail.

858
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:07,049
I can't begin to tell you how
incompetent our police department is.

859
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:08,927
That officer Peters
who pulled me over --

860
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,238
he's going to be receiving a big,
fat subpoena,

861
00:35:11,253 --> 00:35:13,484
and I'm not stopping there.

862
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:15,421
Wait.

863
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:18,241
What is this? What's this car?

864
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:20,504
What's going on here?

865
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:22,671
Are you two on a date?

866
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,607
No way.
You are not changing the subject.

867
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,851
We're not talking about anything
else except you in the clink.

868
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:29,596
Now, come on. Spill.
What was it like on the inside, huh?

869
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:31,830
Did you try to tunnel your
way out with a spoon?

870
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:33,948
You know ? Did they try to make
you join a gang?

871
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:35,838
And, mom,
now that you're on the outside

872
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:36,988
and they're still
on the inside,

873
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:39,241
are they gonna try to use you
as some kind of prison mule?

874
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:42,676
I just --
so much I need to know!

875
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:46,914
So, after my third callback,
he says to me,

876
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:50,426
"a girl can't play Oscar Wilde. I want
people to take this production seriously,"

877
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,121
like he's Peter
Brook or something

878
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:54,502
And not some goateed
sophomore from Arkansas.

879
00:35:54,513 --> 00:35:56,322
So I give him my most
foppish stare and say,

880
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:58,376
"life is too important
to be taken seriously."

881
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,055
Nice.

882
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,309
But on the way out,
as I'm making my dramatic exit,

883
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,584
I walk right into the glass door,
like smack.

884
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:04,636
No. Ouch!

885
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:07,621
So the next semester, he keeps
hounding me about how I'd be perfect

886
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:09,163
for his production of
"California suite"

887
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,235
because I have such a
gift for physical comedy.

888
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:15,924
Holy crap!
Your boyfriend is rich.

889
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,439
And he's got some wild stuff.

890
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:20,700
I mean, what's this about?

891
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:23,676
Well, I must eat.
I'm positively famished.

892
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:25,843
Nice sound system.

893
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,991
Do you have popcorn?

894
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:30,628
Um, yeah,
there should be some in there.

895
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,976
You have a hell of a lot
of rice in here, Rory.

896
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,317
White rice, brown rice,
long-stem rice.

897
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,850
You are simply crazy for rice.

898
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:38,348
Who doesn't like rice?

899
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,139
Look who found an air popper!

900
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:42,337
Genius.

901
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:43,661
Now we just need some popcorn.

902
00:36:43,676 --> 00:36:45,513
Or something else that
could be cooked in here.

903
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:49,166
Rice. Who's up for a late-night
snack of air-popped rice?

904
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:51,035
Oh, wow,
that must be my Logan call.

905
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,907
I didn't realize it
was so late already.

906
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,794
Time flies when you're
partying with an artist.

907
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:55,640
Hey!

908
00:36:55,652 --> 00:36:57,086
- Hey.
- Hi.

909
00:36:57,103 --> 00:36:58,852
What's going on?
You having a party there, Ace?

910
00:36:58,887 --> 00:37:00,665
Oh, no, I'm just hanging out
with a few friends.

911
00:37:00,697 --> 00:37:02,124
- Just friends, huh?
- Yeah.

912
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,397
Anybody I know, or...?

913
00:37:03,414 --> 00:37:04,999
No. Just some girls I met.

914
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,111
- Hi, Logan!
- Hi, Logan!

915
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,248
Just girls, huh?
Your new boyfriend's not over.

916
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:11,331
Nope. Just us girls hanging
out in our underwear,

917
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:13,564
throwing pillows at each other --
you know, girl stuff.

918
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,578
Sounds very wholesome and loud.

919
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:17,496
- Yeah, we're --
- Hey, Rory!

920
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:19,298
Hold on just a sec. Yeah?

921
00:37:19,314 --> 00:37:21,850
This says it's popcorn,
but it looks so fancy.

922
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,670
Can I open it, or are you saving it
for a special occasion or something?

923
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:26,118
Go ahead.

924
00:37:26,132 --> 00:37:27,577
Hey, uh, sorry.

925
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:29,531
Is it okay if I call
you back later?

926
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,979
Sure, no problem. Have fun.

927
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:32,973
I will. Love you. Bye.

928
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:36,659
Is that too much popcorn?

929
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,073
- Uh, yeah.
- I'm really hungry.

930
00:37:40,193 --> 00:37:43,659
Okay. Someone's got
some explaining to do.

931
00:37:45,736 --> 00:37:48,145
I mean, they escorted her
out in her stocking feet.

932
00:37:48,162 --> 00:37:49,212
Her shoes in a bag.

933
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,717
Somewhere in my
youth or childhood...

934
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:52,368
...you must have
done something good.

935
00:37:52,382 --> 00:37:53,890
The universe owed me this one.

936
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:55,973
- I'm glad you had fun.
- I did. Didn't you have fun?

937
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:57,583
Yeah, I did. It was great.

938
00:37:57,598 --> 00:37:59,638
It was one of the
"great" greats. What?

939
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:02,359
Nothing. I feel I may have
gotten overshadowed a bit.

940
00:38:02,374 --> 00:38:04,210
I mean, how's my little barn
movie supposed to compare

941
00:38:04,244 --> 00:38:05,542
with your mom in jail?

942
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,624
Chris, no!

943
00:38:07,638 --> 00:38:09,438
It was just the cherry on top,

944
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,735
the mint on the pillow of what
was already a perfect night.

945
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,451
No, I loved our date.
It was amazing.

946
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:16,648
I loved the movie.

947
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:19,442
I'll never forget the movie I saw the
night I picked my mother up from jail.

948
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:21,108
You're never gonna get tired
of saying that, are you?

949
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:23,841
"Picked up my mom from jail"?
No, I don't think I ever will.

950
00:38:23,857 --> 00:38:26,249
I'm just so glad you
were with me tonight.

951
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:29,989
I mean, anybody else who
would have seen me laughing

952
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,487
as I bailed my
mother out of jail

953
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,166
would have just thought I
was completely deranged.

954
00:38:33,197 --> 00:38:36,992
Well, I know you're deranged but
for completely different reasons.

955
00:38:37,006 --> 00:38:39,294
I mean, you just get it,

956
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:41,708
and you make everything fun,

957
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:44,711
and it's so nice to be with
someone who understands you

958
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:46,686
and makes you...

959
00:38:54,842 --> 00:38:56,707
I'll call you tomorrow.

960
00:38:57,939 --> 00:39:00,776
- Gigi's with her grandmother?
- She is.

961
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,037
You want to come in?

962
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,983
Yeah?

963
00:39:09,488 --> 00:39:11,162
Yeah.
