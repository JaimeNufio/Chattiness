1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,496
- Hello?
- Do you come bearing pizza?

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,081
- I'm not an idiot.
- Then get in here.

3
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,584
- Sit. You're missing it.
- What are we watching?

4
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,710
The incomparable Donna Reed Show.

5
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:18,128
- What's in there?
- A salad.

6
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:19,587
Salad?

7
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:24,174
It's a quaint dish sometimes used
to precede large quantities of pizza.

8
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,553
- It's for me.
- Clearly.

9
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:31,263
So, who's Donna Reed?

10
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:33,890
- What?
- You don't know who Donna Reed is?

11
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:36,600
The quintessential '50s mom
with the perfect '50s family?

12
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:38,310
Never without a smile and high heels?

13
00:00:38,394 --> 00:00:40,645
Hair that if you hit with a hammer
would crack?

14
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:43,105
- So, it's a show?
- It's a lifestyle.

15
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:44,523
It's a religion.

16
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:46,941
- My favorite episode...
- Tell me.

17
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:51,445
...is when their son, Jeff, comes home
from school, and nothing happens.

18
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:53,362
That's a good one.

19
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:57,616
One of my favorites is when Mary,
the daughter, gets a part-time job...

20
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:00,325
- and nothing happens.
- Another classic.

21
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:02,577
So what's this one about?

22
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:04,787
This one is actually quite filled
with intrigue.

23
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:08,915
The husband, Alex, comes home
late for dinner, and he didn't call.

24
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,792
Might as well kick the dog, too.

25
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:12,584
Look, she's making doughnuts.

26
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:15,920
...bind in the sugar department.
- I was thinking of something else.

27
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:19,923
Not that my sugary attitude
wouldn't make anyone an instant diabetic.

28
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:22,467
Mother-daughter window washing.
We should try that.

29
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:24,635
Right after
mother-daughter shock treatments.

30
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,471
There's nothing more satisfying
than washing windows. Oh, no.

31
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,306
What? Did I miss a spot?

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,684
No, I just had an impure thought
about your father, Alex.

33
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:37,311
Funny, I don't know why I had it.
It isn't the second Saturday of the month.

34
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,563
I heard you had
an impure thought about me.

35
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:41,939
I must now sublimate
all my impure thoughts...

36
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:45,817
by going into the kitchen and making
an endless string of perfect casseroles.

37
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:49,111
- You're not even listening to the dialogue.
- Ours is better.

38
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:51,696
I don't know,
it all seems kind of nice to me.

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,864
What does?

40
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:56,950
Families hanging together,
a wife cooking dinner for her husband.

41
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,119
- And look, she seems really happy.
- She's medicated.

42
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,746
- And acting from a script.
- Written by a man.

43
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,997
Well said, sister suffragette.

44
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:06,999
What if she likes making doughnuts
and dinner for her family...

45
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,376
and keeping things nice for them...

46
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,338
Okay, I feel very unpopular right now.

47
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,923
You know, dear,
the first 10 years we were married...

48
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:19,091
I was upset
when you came home late for dinner.

49
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:21,176
- Then you're not anymore?
- No.

50
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,554
You are no longer late for dinner.
You're just extremely early for breakfast.

51
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:28,181
Voila! Your breakfast.

52
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,141
Hey, l'm not saying a word.

53
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:31,309
- Can brains hurt?
- Yes, it's hypochondria hour.

54
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:34,437
I'm serious. Last night,
when I was reading my biology chapters...

55
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:37,231
I distinctly heard a ping
in the vicinity of my brain.

56
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:39,149
- Your brain pinged?
- Yeah.

57
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:42,902
- It just went dink.
- Then your brain dinked. It didn't ping.

58
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:45,904
A dinking brain isn't any less worrisome
than a pinging brain.

59
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:48,531
- You got me there.
- So should I go to a tumor doctor?

60
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,741
You don't have a tumor.
You're reading too much.

61
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:53,493
- You're probably just losing your eyesight.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:54,702
You're welcome.

63
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:57,954
Hi, can you take
a little constructive criticism?

64
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,706
- No.
- Okay, this place could use a makeover.

65
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:03,042
It needs sprucing up, like a coat of paint.

66
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,543
- I don't spruce.
- What do you mean you don't spruce?

67
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:09,421
- What he means is he won't spruce.
- Taylor, do not start.

68
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:12,006
Me and the rest of
the Town Beautification Committee...

69
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,841
have been hounding him for years
to freshen up the place.

70
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:18,802
Maybe a couple of nice zinnia pots
out front, some yellow awnings...

71
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:21,680
a peppy little cardboard pig
announcing the specials.

72
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:22,889
But he's a mule.

73
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:26,183
He won't talk, he won't reason,
he won't spruce.

74
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,727
You might as well forget it, Lorelai.
I'm forgetting it, too.

75
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,437
Finally a Taylor Doose position
I can get behind.

76
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:35,481
Faded paint is a bad reflection
on the whole town.

77
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:40,026
- Whatever happened to giving up?
- When standards slip, families flee...

78
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,278
and in comes the seedy crowd.
You got trouble, my friends.

79
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,863
Right here in River City.

80
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:47,740
- This is not funny, Lorelai.
- Does anyone want anything?

81
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:51,243
Yes, I do. I want to know
why you won't paint this place.

82
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:55,663
It's a pain. I'd have to close for a day,
which I can't afford, or paint it at night...

83
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:58,832
which I don't want to do
because I hate painting.

84
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,041
How about this?

85
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,043
- I'll help you. I love to paint.
- You do?

86
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:03,085
- Yes, I do.
- You love it?

87
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,253
- I want to marry it.
- You have strange passions.

88
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:08,088
She likes washing dishes, too.
She's multifaceted abnormal.

89
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:11,133
Come on. We'll drink a couple of beers,
sing painting songs.

90
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:13,676
- Painting songs?
- Yeah, painting songs.

91
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,095
Like, you know, the song that goes:

92
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,138
Grab your brush and grab your rollers

93
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,265
All you kids and all you bowlers

94
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:24,767
We're going paintin' today

95
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,311
Say yes, or there's another verse.

96
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:30,771
I guess maybe if I had help.

97
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:35,609
- Really? Oh, my God, that's wonderful!
- Taylor, it's not for you. It's for me.

98
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,944
I can't wait to tell the rest
of the committee. They won't believe this.

99
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:41,279
I hate that he's pleased.

100
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,489
You'll drop a gum wrapper in the street
in front of his store later.

101
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:45,991
Yeah, good idea.

102
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:50,452
Kick-ass wine.

103
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,997
- How poetic.
- It's got a nice smell. Earthy, vibrant.

104
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,832
- You can taste the Italian's feet.
- It's a Bordeaux. It's French.

105
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,627
What's an Italian's foot doing
in a French wine?

106
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,170
So when do you guys leave
for Martha's Vineyard?

107
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:05,422
We're not going
to Martha's Vineyard this year.

108
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:06,505
Why not?

109
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,217
Our usual rental wasn't available
when we inquired... late.

110
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,385
We should have just
bought a place years ago, like I wanted.

111
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,845
It wouldn't have been prudent.

112
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:18,472
- Now we have no place to go next week.
- You could always go somewhere else.

113
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,766
We always go to the Vineyard
at this time of year.

114
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,559
You could break the chain, Dad.

115
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:24,435
- Go to Paris.
- Yes, Paris.

116
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,353
- Impressionism, poodles...
- Creme brulee.

117
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:27,855
- That's great.
- Impossible.

118
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:29,481
Pourquoi? French.

119
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:31,190
We only go to Europe in the fall.

120
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:33,483
I heard a rumor
Europe's still there in spring.

121
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,986
- I heard it, too.
- We know it's there in the spring.

122
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:38,612
But we never go then
because we always go in the fall.

123
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:40,655
It's getting a bit too Lewis Carroll for me.

124
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:43,366
What is so interesting
about Europe in the spring?

125
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,700
Spring vegetables.

126
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,868
You want us to go to Europe
to eat a vegetable?

127
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:48,995
No, I don't know. There's all kinds of stuff.

128
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,872
- There's festivals and, you know, Europe.
- In the fall.

129
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:54,457
It costs a fortune
to travel first-class in Europe.

130
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,042
- We only do it every two years.
- In the fall.

131
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:01,087
- It's just not in the budget this year.
- You don't have to fly first class.

132
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,339
'Cause there's always coach.

133
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:10,010
Or business class is slightly less.
There's deals on the Internet.

134
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:18,183
- Pass the potatoes.
- You got it.

135
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:22,644
'Catherine the Great, 1729 to'96.

136
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:26,647
- 'Empress of Russia, 1762 to '96.'
- Hold still, please.

137
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:30,567
'Originally named Sophie Friederike
Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst.'

138
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,401
But everybody called her Kitten.

139
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,779
'Married to Grand Duke Peter of Holstein
in 1754.'

140
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:39,364
- Rory, seriously...
- 'The marriage was an unhappy one.'

141
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:41,366
There were way too many names.

142
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:45,368
Lady with notecards,
look at lady with needle and focus...

143
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:48,162
so I can sew the button on your sweater
and not on my thumb.

144
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:49,580
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:51,248
I'll get it.

146
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,083
You're 4 years old.

147
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,835
- Hiya, baby doll.
- Hi, Babbette.

148
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,336
You want some coffee?

149
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,297
- No, I just came over to ask a big favor.
- Ask away.

150
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,800
Morey just got a call to play a gig
at the Village Vanguard tonight...

151
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:07,426
- so we gotta go to New York.
- Wow!

152
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,386
- Cream?
- And sugar. Thanks.

153
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:11,929
Anyway, yesterday
Morey and I finally broke down...

154
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:14,390
and we got ourselves a new baby.

155
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:16,641
Honey, you got a kitten. Good for you.

156
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:21,228
- What's its name?
- Apricot. He's just the cutest thing.

157
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:24,272
But he's so teeny.
There's no way he can go with us...

158
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:26,691
and I would hate for him
to stay alone in the house.

159
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:30,818
So I was thinking maybe Rory could
come over and housesit for the evening.

160
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,277
- I'd love to.
- Great.

161
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:34,780
We got a kitchen full of food,
and Morey got cable...

162
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:37,782
so you can watch those four girls
talking dirty if you want to.

163
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:39,074
- Sounds good.
- You're an angel.

164
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:41,827
- Both of you, angels. You have a key?
- We got it covered.

165
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,620
Great, l'll leave you the number
of where we're staying.

166
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:46,663
Have a good time.
We'll be back tomorrow.

167
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:48,748
- I love you crazy girls.
- Bye!

168
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:55,169
I can't believe how fast you agreed
to spend the night away from me.

169
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,462
You're crazy. I'm doing her a favor.

170
00:08:57,797 --> 00:08:58,881
Sure you are.

171
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:02,383
That's okay. Don't you worry about me.
I'll be just fine.

172
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,552
I'd like to debate you on that,
but l'm late for the bus.

173
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:08,596
This is only the second night
we've ever spent apart.

174
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,640
- Doesn't that make you sad?
- Yeah, but l'll get over it.

175
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:15,810
Paul and Linda McCartney only spent
11 nights apart their entire relationship.

176
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,936
- Did you know that?
- I did not know that.

177
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,313
They were truly devoted to each other.

178
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,480
Being apart was too painful
to even talk about.

179
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:23,649
I understand.

180
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:27,151
I don't think Linda would've even
considered cat-sitting without Paul.

181
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:30,695
Mom, when I go off to college,
l'm gonna be gone every night.

182
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,739
- What will you do then?
- I will go with you.

183
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,533
I'll sleep on the floor in your dorm,
next to your bed.

184
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,785
- At least you've got a plan.
- Yes.

185
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:41,829
Perhaps you'd like to take
a picture of me with you tonight.

186
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,496
- In case you get Ionely, you can talk to it.
- Bye.

187
00:09:57,257 --> 00:10:00,425
- Carry your bird, miss?
- Hi, I didn't expect to see you here.

188
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:02,510
I just wanted to say hello.

189
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:05,721
Hello.

190
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:11,307
- So, who's your friend?
- Homework.

191
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:12,476
Really?

192
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:16,812
We will be cohabitating for the next month
so I can examine its every move.

193
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:18,980
- Jealous?
- I'll get over it.

194
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,192
I'm house-sitting tonight for Babbette,
and I was thinking...

195
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:26,569
maybe if the right offer came along,
I might be up to some company.

196
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:28,070
- I'm offering.
- I'm accepting.

197
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:29,905
- Good.
- You wanna get some coffee?

198
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:31,907
I can't. I have to get to work.

199
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,075
- I thought you go to work at 5:00.
- No, 4:00 on Thursdays.

200
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,410
For some reason,
Thursday's always really busy.

201
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:41,079
Lots of oppressed housewives
shopping for their husbands' dinner.

202
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:42,872
- Wow.
- What?

203
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:45,374
That was a little pointed.

204
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,376
- What are you talking about?
- The crack about the housewives...

205
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:52,004
- shopping for their husbands' dinner.
- Come on, it was a joke.

206
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:55,006
It was a pretty weird joke to hear
coming out of your mouth.

207
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,758
You are so sensitive
about the whole Donna Reed thing.

208
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:00,343
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just find it ridiculous.

209
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,094
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

210
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,555
- So she cooked a lot.
- A lot?

211
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:07,099
She made homemade doughnuts,
chocolate cake...

212
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:08,974
a lamb chop-mashed potato dinner...

213
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:12,185
and enough stew to feed Cambodia
all in one episode.

214
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,979
- So what?
- You really like that concept, don't you?

215
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:17,689
No, I... Yeah, sort of.

216
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:19,982
- Oh, my God.
- It's a little over the top...

217
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:23,193
but the general idea
of a wife cooking dinner for her family...

218
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:25,695
That's nice. Why is that not nice?

219
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:27,529
It's not just that.

220
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:31,908
It's the having to have the dinner on the
table as soon as the husband gets home...

221
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,410
and having to look perfect
to do housework...

222
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:38,538
and the whole concept that her one point
in life is to serve somebody else.

223
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,081
Yes, but maybe
there are two points of view here.

224
00:11:41,123 --> 00:11:42,123
I don't think so.

225
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,583
You feel that way
because your mother feels that way.

226
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:48,420
- So I have no opinions of my own?
- I didn't mean that.

227
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:52,423
If I have no opinions of my own,
then l'd be just the kind of girl you like.

228
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:56,343
My mom made dinner for my dad
every day before she started working.

229
00:11:56,426 --> 00:12:00,053
Now she even does it on the weekends.
What does that say about her?

230
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,555
It says she has a choice
and Donna Reed didn't.

231
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,598
You do realize
that Donna Reed wasn't real.

232
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,559
I know that, but she represented
millions of women that were real...

233
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,603
and did have to dress and act like that...

234
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:13,605
Please tell me how we began arguing
about The Donna Reed Show.

235
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,106
I don't know.

236
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:21,944
Look, I gotta go to work, so...

237
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:24,947
- Bye.
- Dean?

238
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,948
- What?
- Bird.

239
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:37,414
- Good, l'm just about to leave.
- Where are you going?

240
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:40,041
To Luke's.
We're picking out paint colors tonight...

241
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:42,333
so it's gonna be hours
of 'yes, no, yes, no'...

242
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:44,419
until my famous perseverance
wears him down...

243
00:12:44,503 --> 00:12:47,046
and he ends up in a ball on the floor
crying like a girl.

244
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,505
- Wanna come watch?
- I'm house-sitting, remember?

245
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:51,715
Yeah, but you have to eat.
Come have a burger.

246
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,134
No, thanks.

247
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:57,136
- What is that?
- It's for school.

248
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:00,806
- He's so cute. What's his name?
- Case Study Number 12.

249
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:02,307
Is that hyphenated?

250
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,350
Honey, he's adorable.
He should have a name.

251
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,268
I'm not bonding with my midterm,
thank you.

252
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:10,396
All right, l'll name him.
Hi, your name is Stanley. Hi, Stanley.

253
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,647
It's a girl.

254
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:14,232
Sorry about the Stanley thing.
Your name is Stella.

255
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,317
Stella's nice,
and she was married to Stanley.

256
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:17,860
Call it whatever you want.

257
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:22,112
- You're grumpy. What happened?
- Nothing, just a long day.

258
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:23,656
You know what the remedy is?

259
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:27,199
A ringside seat while Luke envisions
strangling me with his baseball cap.

260
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:30,869
I'll leave the chick here tonight
so the kitten doesn't get any fancy ideas.

261
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:33,496
She's been fed.
If she gets too loud, put her in my room.

262
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,664
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

263
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,001
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Just a bad afternoon. I'll fix it.

264
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:43,128
Call me if you need a wrench
or something.

265
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:44,379
I will.

266
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:52,343
Now, this is another way to go.

267
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:55,512
Sort of a French bistro kind of a look.

268
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:58,180
- This isn't a French bistro.
- Really?

269
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:00,474
It's amazing
what you learn when you listen.

270
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:02,017
Which you usually don't.

271
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:04,894
Then I don't have useless information
intruding in my brain.

272
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,270
Thank God.

273
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:10,398
If you wanted to do more warm,
golden Tuscan countryside...

274
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,108
Then l'd go to Italy. Here, l'll wrap this.

275
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,360
We could also go with...

276
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:18,487
a pastelly English-country-garden theme.

277
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,697
Maybe we could add stenciling
on the ceiling.

278
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:24,116
- No stenciling.
- Do you even know what stenciling is?

279
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:26,534
- Does Martha Stewart do it?
- Yes.

280
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,161
No stenciling.

281
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:31,872
- Ask him.
- I will.

282
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,706
- Go on.
- Don't push.

283
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,667
- Hello.
- What do you want, Kirk?

284
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,211
Taylor tells me
you're thinking of painting this place.

285
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:41,044
That's right. He is.

286
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:43,880
Excuse me, l'd like to hear it from him.

287
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,049
- Luke, is that true?
- Yes, Kirk, it is true.

288
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:48,300
- Really?
- Yes.

289
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:50,260
- This is your final decision?
- Yes, it is.

290
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:52,220
- 'Cause it's not too late...
- You heard him.

291
00:14:52,262 --> 00:14:54,555
He's painting this place. Pay up.

292
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:58,558
Thank you.

293
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:02,685
- Sorry, man.
- It's a little late for that, don't you think?

294
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:06,563
I like this.

295
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,316
Okay, I get it.

296
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:14,736
Hold on.

297
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,993
Meow if you need anything else.

298
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,677
Hi, is Dean in? This is Rory.

299
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:56,265
Will you tell him I called? Okay, thanks.

300
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,231
- You ready to talk paint?
- No.

301
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:09,025
Good. I've got all the choices set up...

302
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:11,694
and while any one of them would work...

303
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:15,447
I think this combo is currently my favorite.

304
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:19,783
See? Imagine, this will be for the walls,
this will be for the trim...

305
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:21,910
the edging around the doors
and the windows.

306
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:24,202
- I know what the trim is.
- Okay.

307
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:27,121
The colors are quite similar
to what you have here now...

308
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:29,415
but they're a little richer, a little warmer.

309
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:31,959
What do you think? Wait, wait.

310
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:42,675
- A little ambience?
- This is a diner. We don't do ambience.

311
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:45,093
One argument at a time.
So what do you think?

312
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:48,054
Honestly? I have no idea. Do you like it?

313
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:50,305
- Yeah.
- Okay.

314
00:16:50,347 --> 00:16:51,556
Good.

315
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:54,642
What are you doing?

316
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:58,144
The Town Council wanted to do
a before-and-after poster.

317
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:00,104
- Out.
- Bye.

318
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,316
That's it. We're closed for the night.

319
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,151
Since you have to take everything
off the walls anyway...

320
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,860
now is a good time to decide...

321
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,530
what stuff you'll keep
and what stuff you'll get rid of.

322
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:14,447
- Everything stays.
- Okay.

323
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:17,241
There is a plastic dancing pork chop
that says...

324
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:19,076
Everything stays.

325
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,245
'...I lost my head over a good chop.
You should, too.'

326
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,664
- Everything stays.
- Okay, everything stays.

327
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:27,332
This place hasn't been painted
since my dad was alive.

328
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:30,751
- No, I didn't know that.
- He painted it before he opened it...

329
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:33,795
and once more
when the roof caved in one winter.

330
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:37,506
- I think that's probably it.
- The paint lasted a long time.

331
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,716
- He got his money's worth.
- Yeah.

332
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,385
He really loved this place, you know?

333
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:47,722
The store was his life. Mine, too, I guess.

334
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:51,307
I spent every minute I wasn't in school
in here.

335
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:54,101
I spent a lot of minutes
I was supposed to be in school.

336
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,811
But why a diner?
Why didn't you keep it a hardware store?

337
00:17:56,895 --> 00:18:00,105
I didn't love the hardware business
the way my dad did...

338
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:04,316
and I knew how to cook,
so I thought a diner would be more...

339
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:08,320
- fun.
- That's a hard word for you to say.

340
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:13,366
I just always wanted to work here.

341
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:16,992
- Just where Dad did.
- God, that's nice...

342
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,829
to be so, I don't know,
connected to your dad.

343
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:27,959
- I would have loved that.
- You've got that with Rory.

344
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,169
Yeah, I guess so.

345
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,588
I still think
there's a spot on the wall somewhere...

346
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:35,464
where my dad took an order one day
when he ran out of paper.

347
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,425
- Really? Where?
- I don't know.

348
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,510
Behind the counter maybe.

349
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:44,346
Next to the door.

350
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:47,890
On the right side.

351
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:51,226
Here it is.

352
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:54,520
'Three hammers,
Phillips-head screwdriver.'

353
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:57,272
'Three boxes of nails in assorted sizes.'

354
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,233
I've seen it from time to time.

355
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:06,070
I guess it is time for a little spruce.

356
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,155
Yeah, it is.

357
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,533
But let's not spruce this particular spot.

358
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:15,452
- That sounds good.
- Okay.

359
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,957
- Jeez.
- No, don't get up.

360
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,334
- Lf I don't...
- They'll go away, trust me.

361
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:29,713
They should be in there.

362
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:33,173
Anyway, just imagine it all in pastels.
The whole thing.

363
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:45,515
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

364
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,395
- I should go.
- Oh, yeah.

365
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:59,651
- It's gonna be great.
- I'm sure it is.

366
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,194
- See you.
- See you.

367
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:14,745
- How's it going?
- Very well.

368
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:17,956
I have discovered that,
in addition to my lameness in geometry...

369
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:22,459
I also will not become a biologist,
French translator, or Civil War buff.

370
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:24,961
I guess that leaves
bass player for the Foo Fighters.

371
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:26,920
I also wouldn't rule out keyboardist...

372
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:29,130
in the Siouxsie and the Banshees
reunion tour.

373
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:30,881
I like that you keep an open mind.

374
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,883
- So, what's up?
- I need to borrow a CD.

375
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,801
- Which one?
- The weird one.

376
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,510
I need more information.

377
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:39,095
I don't know which one it is,
but if I saw it, l'd know.

378
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,972
Okay, let's have a look.

379
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:48,311
Okay, we have classic rock,
progressive rock, pretty-boy rock...

380
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:49,478
Excuse me?

381
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,480
Bon Jovi, Duran Duran,
The Wallflowers, Bush...

382
00:20:52,523 --> 00:20:53,982
Got it. Next?

383
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:59,319
Punk, new wave, German metal bands...

384
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,488
- Broadway soundtracks.
- Interesting filing system.

385
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,656
- Anything yet?
- Nope, sorry.

386
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:09,493
Over there, we have jazz, jazz vocals,
classical, country...

387
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:12,871
rockabilly, Sinatra, The Capitol Years.
Oh, wait.

388
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:15,997
- The miscellaneous section.
- That sounds right.

389
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:18,666
William Shatner.

390
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,751
Is this the one
where he sings Tambourine Man?

391
00:21:20,835 --> 00:21:23,044
And Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

392
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:25,504
Remind me to get this for my mom
for her birthday.

393
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:27,672
Oh, wait. That's it.

394
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:30,299
- Can I?
- Take it.

395
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:32,592
- Thanks.
- So, what are you doing?

396
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:36,221
- I'm not completely sure yet.
- Okay, I want details.

397
00:21:55,652 --> 00:21:56,861
Oh, no.

398
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:02,614
Do something. Show yourself.

399
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,866
Molt, or chirp, or something.

400
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,869
This is so not funny. Not funny.

401
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,705
This is unbelievable.
All day long, just chirps like a maniac...

402
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,792
at the top of her lungs.
And now, nothing. Silence.

403
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,626
Marcel Marceau chicken.

404
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:23,046
That's okay. I can fix this. We can fix this.

405
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:26,340
I'm going to make this better.

406
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:29,259
I'm going to fix...

407
00:22:29,426 --> 00:22:30,885
- Hello?
- Yeah?

408
00:22:30,927 --> 00:22:34,179
Stella got out, and I don't know...
Do I put seed on the floor...

409
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:36,848
do I make cheeping sounds,
or do I pull a Lucy Ricardo...

410
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:39,266
and walk like a chicken
so she thinks l'm her mother?

411
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,601
- Who is this?
- What do you mean? It's Lorelai.

412
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,770
Who else would call you
looking for her chick?

413
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:45,812
You're right. I'm the idiot. Go on.

414
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,856
Could you come over here, please,
and help me?

415
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:53,860
Yeah, okay. I'll be right over.

416
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:55,402
Okay, hurry.

417
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:04,535
Thank God. Get in here.

418
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,245
This place is a disaster. What's going on?

419
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,249
Okay, the last sighting was here,
by the InStyle magazine.

420
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,417
But then she burrowed through
the Glamour, jumped over the Cosmo...

421
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:17,293
and knocked over a bottle of nail polish.

422
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:20,254
So if there was any doubt
that this chick was a girl...

423
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:21,713
there isn't anymore.

424
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:24,173
- Okay, there she is.
- Jeez, what was that?

425
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:29,719
- You really do have a chick loose in here.
- Yeah, I told you.

426
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:31,721
There she goes by the kitchen!

427
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:34,180
- Don't step on her!
- She cut right in front of me.

428
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:35,932
She's being graded, so don't squash her.

429
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,558
Tell her to watch where she's going.

430
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:42,270
Hello?

431
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,231
I wasn't sure if you still wanted me
to come over.

432
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:49,233
- I do, I absolutely do.
- Are you sure?

433
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:52,653
Yeah, l'm totally and completely...

434
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:55,572
- You're teasing me.
- Yeah, a little.

435
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:58,156
But I did appreciate the enthusiasm.

436
00:23:58,324 --> 00:24:01,951
- So how long until you get here?
- Actually, not long at all.

437
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:04,536
- Why? Where are you?
- Right outside.

438
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,211
- What the...
- Honey, you're home.

439
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:23,008
Say something.

440
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,051
Trick or treat?

441
00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:29,721
- What, you don't like it?
- No, I do.

442
00:24:31,181 --> 00:24:33,140
It's got a large circumference.

443
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:36,142
Thank you. Now come on in.
It's cold outside.

444
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,191
Oh, my God.

445
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:50,986
Here, let me take your coat.

446
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:53,655
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

447
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,118
- Interesting music.
- I'm glad you like it.

448
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:04,746
- So what's that?
- Just some appetizers before dinner.

449
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:06,498
- Before dinner?
- Yes.

450
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:08,290
- Are we going out?
- No.

451
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,250
- Ordering pizza?
- Nope.

452
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,211
- So...
- I made you dinner.

453
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:16,296
- Excuse me?
- Steak, green beans, mashed potatoes...

454
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:18,799
- You made me dinner?
- That's right.

455
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:21,259
- You made me dinner?
- And dessert.

456
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:26,220
- Okay, what is going on here?
- I'm sorry, I thought it was obvious.

457
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:28,222
It's Donna Reed night.

458
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:34,060
- I swear she went over there.
- We looked over there.

459
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:36,394
She went under that chair
and didn't come out.

460
00:25:36,478 --> 00:25:39,146
We moved the chair,
we searched the floor. Nothing.

461
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:42,690
- Then she went through a hole in the floor.
- There's no hole in the floor.

462
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:46,109
Maybe there was a hole,
and she crawled through it and fixed it.

463
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:50,529
Then she's a super-intelligent chick
with great physical and deductive skills.

464
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:53,740
This is not a chick I wanna find.

465
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:57,826
- Hey, Luke, what did you mean earlier?
- What are you talking about?

466
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,994
When you got here,
you made some comment...

467
00:26:00,037 --> 00:26:02,955
about me not really having
a chick in the house.

468
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:06,708
I mean, if I didn't have a chick here,
why did you think I was calling?

469
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,710
No, I thought you were calling
about the chick.

470
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:13,838
- It didn't seem like it.
- Maybe it didn't seem like it, but it was.

471
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,214
Was what?

472
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:19,592
Was what I... thought.
Can we just keep looking?

473
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:20,926
Okay.

474
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:24,470
- I just still think...
- There she is.

475
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,014
- Where?
- There.

476
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,849
Careful.

477
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:31,642
Well?

478
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:36,187
- What can I say?
- You can say it's perfect.

479
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:38,230
- It's perfect.
- Thank you.

480
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:40,358
How is it really?

481
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,192
- It's perfect.
- Yeah?

482
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,986
It's amazing. I've never had anyone
make dinner for me before.

483
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,280
Except my mom, and believe me,
it's not the same.

484
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:51,449
I'm extremely glad to hear that.

485
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:54,868
Wait. You wanna save room
for dessert, right?

486
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:58,704
That's right. So, what's for dessert?

487
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:00,621
Lime Fantasy Supreme.

488
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:02,539
Which is...

489
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,091
- Green Jell-O and Cool Whip.
- You are insane.

490
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:20,386
Oh, no. I forgot to make the rolls.

491
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:22,429
- What?
- I was gonna make rolls.

492
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:25,432
- That's okay.
- I can't believe I forgot them.

493
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,601
- What are you doing?
- I'll make them now.

494
00:27:29,768 --> 00:27:32,228
Hold on. Come on.

495
00:27:33,104 --> 00:27:35,230
We really don't need rolls.

496
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:37,732
Donna Reed would have
never forgotten the rolls.

497
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:40,442
They're gonna make me turn in my pearls.

498
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:50,450
I promise l'll kick anyone's butt
who comes near those pearls.

499
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:01,249
As really amazing
as this whole thing was...

500
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:04,626
I mean, the music, the outfit, the dinner...

501
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:07,754
I hope you know
that I don't expect you to be Donna Reed.

502
00:28:07,838 --> 00:28:10,756
And I don't want you to be Donna Reed.
That's not what I meant.

503
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,091
This just totally
got blown out of proportion.

504
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:15,634
I'm actually pretty happy with you.

505
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:20,221
I know and I appreciate that,
but aside from this actually being fun...

506
00:28:20,305 --> 00:28:22,640
I did a little research on Donna Reed.

507
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:25,267
- You did research on Donna Reed?
- Look.

508
00:28:27,143 --> 00:28:31,604
She did do the whole milk and cookies,
wholesome, big-skirt thing.

509
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:32,981
But aside from that...

510
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:36,817
she was an uncredited producer
and director on her television show...

511
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,443
which made her
one of the first woman TV executives...

512
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,237
which is actually pretty impressive.

513
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,655
I'm glad this turned out to be
such a positive experience for you.

514
00:28:44,698 --> 00:28:45,865
It has been.

515
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:49,326
And though l'll probably never
get the feeling back in my little toe...

516
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:51,118
- l'd do it again.
- Yeah?

517
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:54,580
Someday. But for now,
I better get these dishes cleaned up.

518
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:56,456
I'll help.

519
00:28:56,581 --> 00:29:00,125
Sorry, you're a man.
You can't help for another 15 years.

520
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:04,962
Okay, then as the man,
I will do what the man is supposed to do.

521
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:07,255
- Go bowling?
- Take out the trash.

522
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:11,300
She's never going anywhere ever again.

523
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,136
I think l'll put Superglue
on the bottom of the cage.

524
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,971
That would be bad, right?
I know staples are bad...

525
00:29:18,014 --> 00:29:21,099
- but what's the verdict on Superglue?
- Ask Stella.

526
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:23,225
You don't have to do that.

527
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:26,311
This stuff is sharp.
I wanna get it out of the way.

528
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:29,396
- Thanks for helping.
- No problem.

529
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,856
I'm gonna throw this stuff outside.

530
00:29:50,787 --> 00:29:52,830
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

531
00:29:52,872 --> 00:29:55,373
- You first.
- I'm looking for a chick.

532
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:57,500
- Yeah, me, too.
- You are not.

533
00:29:57,584 --> 00:29:59,168
Neither are you.

534
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:00,877
Hey, Luke, is there...

535
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,840
Lorelai, hi.

536
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,841
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Yeah.

537
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:14,554
The Jell-O's doing
this weird melty thing and I...

538
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:16,722
Mom, Luke.

539
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:18,098
- Rory.
- Hi.

540
00:30:18,808 --> 00:30:21,851
- What the hell are you two doing?
- Nothing, she...

541
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:24,270
We ate dinner. Steak and beans...

542
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:26,521
Canned, not fresh.

543
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,356
- And potatoes.
- From a box.

544
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:29,690
But they were still good.

545
00:30:29,732 --> 00:30:31,566
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

546
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:33,400
What were you guys doing?

547
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:36,653
I was in the house.

548
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:40,364
And the lamp sort of...
l'm gonna get going. I'm sorry about the...

549
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,032
- Forget it.
- Okay, bye.

550
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,409
Yeah, l'd probably better go, too.

551
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,370
- Thanks for dinner.
- You're welcome.

552
00:30:48,996 --> 00:30:50,080
What?

553
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:54,250
Okay, you're 16, you have
a whole house to yourself for the evening.

554
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:56,752
I expect you're gonna have
your boyfriend over.

555
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:58,836
But what is with the apron?

556
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:02,589
- It's a long story.
- Did it involve a sharp blow to the head?

557
00:31:02,673 --> 00:31:04,174
I gotta go check on Apricot.

558
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:07,842
- Oh, my God. I just saw the pearls.
- I'm going in now.

559
00:31:07,926 --> 00:31:10,469
I'm going inside, too,
because I have to write down...

560
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:12,679
how l'm gonna torture you
about that outfit.

561
00:31:12,763 --> 00:31:15,306
- Good night.
- Could I get a picture though?

562
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,559
Because visual aids would really help.
The shoes. I'm dying.

563
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:29,400
- Mom, I can't find Apricot!
- What? No.

564
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:32,277
She was on the couch when I came out,
and now nowhere.

565
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:36,030
That's it!
We are not animal people, period.

566
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,077
It was a tiny little favor.

567
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:47,288
- We have had this discussion before.
- You are being unreasonable.

568
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,540
- I have my standards.
- But this is a simple request.

569
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:54,376
You are asking me to compromise
my artistic and culinary values.

570
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,753
- Michel wanted an egg-white omelet?
- Yes.

571
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:59,172
- Crazy man.
- Why am I a crazy man?

572
00:31:59,255 --> 00:32:01,006
I had no time for breakfast today.

573
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,550
So I nicely asked her to make me
an egg-white omelet...

574
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:07,135
with some tomatoes, mushroom,
a little chives, and she gives me this.

575
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:08,970
- What is this?
- A three-egg omelet...

576
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:12,431
with goat cheese, pancetta,
cooked in a sherry olive oil.

577
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,891
I don't eat dairy or meat. You know this.

578
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,393
I am a chef, Michel. It is my job
to make food that tastes good.

579
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:21,437
- And you do.
- But I can't eat like that and look like her.

580
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:23,981
- You don't know what you're missing.
- That'll kill you.

581
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:26,942
- You gotta go someday.
- Someday, this will catch up to you.

582
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:31,945
You'll become the balloon lady, and with
the luck of God, I will be here to enjoy it.

583
00:32:35,782 --> 00:32:38,408
- You make a good egg-white omelet.
- I know.

584
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:41,994
- Who wants to hear about my night?
- Oh, me.

585
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:45,080
It started with Rory's baby chick
getting loose in the house...

586
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:47,623
and ended with Rory and I up
at 1:00 in the morning...

587
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,833
Iooking for Babbette's new kitten,
who we found asleep in the piano.

588
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:55,212
- Wow, that's very Wild Kingdom of you.
- I'm the Marlin Perkins of Stars Hollow.

589
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,755
- You want some coffee?
- Please.

590
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:59,632
- So, how's Rory's chick?
- Better than my lemon lamp.

591
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:02,175
- What's wrong with your lemon lamp?
- Luke killed it.

592
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:04,385
- On purpose?
- I can't prove it, but I will.

593
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:05,678
What was Luke doing there?

594
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:08,472
I called him when I got home
and Stella wasn't there.

595
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:10,264
- Stella is the chick?
- Yes.

596
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:12,558
- I like that name.
- Yeah, Streetcar Named Desire.

597
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,601
- Vivien Leigh or Jessica Tandy?
- Hello! Tandy.

598
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:15,977
Of course, continue.

599
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:20,105
So I evaluated the situation in my usual
calm, cool, collected manner...

600
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:22,356
and then I called Luke
to help me track her down.

601
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,066
- That's when he broke the lamp?
- He's not very graceful.

602
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:27,777
- He said the weirdest thing.
- 'May I break your lamp?'

603
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:29,820
He got there and I was looking for Stella...

604
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:32,823
and he said, 'You really have
a baby chick loose in the house.'

605
00:33:32,906 --> 00:33:35,157
Like I made that up or... I don't know.

606
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:36,867
- Well.
- Well what?

607
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,204
You call someone and say, 'Can you come
and help me look for my loose chick?'

608
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,121
- It's a little...
- A little what?

609
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:45,957
It sounds like a code for,
'l'm not wearing any underwear.'

610
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:49,084
That's not the code for,
'l'm not wearing any underwear.'

611
00:33:49,168 --> 00:33:51,002
Sookie, you're not serious.

612
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:54,505
- Look, the first time Jackson and I...
- Yeah.

613
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:58,215
I called him up
and told him I had a bat in my attic.

614
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,760
Honey, you do have a bat in your attic.

615
00:34:00,843 --> 00:34:02,886
So he came over
and we went in the attic...

616
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,347
and we both knew there was no bat,
but we pretended to look for it.

617
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:08,474
Then when we couldn't find the bat...

618
00:34:08,515 --> 00:34:11,350
we went downstairs
and had a bottle of wine and...

619
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:14,019
So you're saying Luke thought
I made up a crazy story...

620
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:17,230
about having some chick
loose in the house just to get him in bed?

621
00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:20,274
Not to get him in bed. Maybe he thought
you wanted to see him...

622
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:22,316
- and didn't know how to say it.
- That's nuts.

623
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,820
A woman asking a man to come over
late at night to her house. Come on.

624
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:29,155
Yeah, but this is Luke we're talking about.

625
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:31,532
- Why did you call him?
- Because I needed help.

626
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:34,242
- Why didn't you call me?
- I assumed you'd be with Jackson.

627
00:34:34,326 --> 00:34:35,701
- I did.
- Why didn't you call Rory?

628
00:34:35,785 --> 00:34:38,036
She'd have been furious
to know Stella was lost.

629
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,163
Why didn't you call Patty?
She raises chickens.

630
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:42,456
Or Andrew? He lives around the corner,
doesn't he?

631
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,333
- What is your point?
- My point is that you called Luke.

632
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,711
Out of all the people
you could have called...

633
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,254
that would have come and dropped
what they were doing, you called Luke.

634
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:55,215
Because I had just been with him.
We were picking out paint samples.

635
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:57,884
He was on my mind.
It was purely a timing thing.

636
00:34:57,968 --> 00:35:00,136
- Picking out paint samples?
- Yes.

637
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,054
- For Luke's place?
- Yes.

638
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:05,139
- So you could paint together?
- Once again, yes.

639
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:06,724
Which, I believe, was your idea.

640
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:09,685
So now the fact
that I suggested painting Luke's diner...

641
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:11,602
also means that I wanted
to get him in bed.

642
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:15,105
Suddenly l'm trying to get any poor,
unsuspecting person in bed with me.

643
00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:16,564
I'm like Michael Douglas.

644
00:35:16,606 --> 00:35:19,941
- Lorelai, this...
- I just... Thanks for the omelet.

645
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:24,445
No, honey, l'm sorry. Don't be mad at me.

646
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:27,781
- I'm not mad. I'm tired.
- Okay.

647
00:35:28,407 --> 00:35:31,158
You know, Luke is a really nice man.

648
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:34,243
Bye, Sookie.

649
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:46,628
- We thought the doorbell wasn't working.
- Come in.

650
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:49,630
We were ringing it and ringing it,
and nobody...

651
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,631
I guess we'll just come in.

652
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:54,592
That'd be the same
as what we were paying for our old place?

653
00:35:54,676 --> 00:35:55,843
Exactly the same.

654
00:35:55,927 --> 00:35:58,470
- Except for the grounds fees.
- The grounds fee is higher.

655
00:35:58,553 --> 00:36:02,055
- But the grounds are larger.
- I'm just trying to get all the information.

656
00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:03,599
All the information...

657
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:07,602
is that this is our last chance
to go to Martha's Vineyard for the season.

658
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:11,771
I realize the position we are in,
but this is a business transaction.

659
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:13,230
For heaven's sake.

660
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:15,065
As a business transaction...

661
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:18,192
one in which money goes out
and we receive goods and services...

662
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,736
And he's patronizing me. How lovely.

663
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:24,864
I must treat this conversation with
the same care and devotion to detail...

664
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:28,617
I would any conversation that would be
considered a business transaction.

665
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,284
Kindly allow me to do so.

666
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:33,119
- Richard, Emily, please.
- Goodness, you startled me.

667
00:36:33,162 --> 00:36:37,748
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say l'm sure
we could negotiate the grounds fee.

668
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:39,082
That'll be fine.

669
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,918
Good. I'll get into this right now
and get back to you.

670
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:44,086
- Thank you, John.
- Yes, we'll talk to you later.

671
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,254
Bye.

672
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:47,589
Careful, Richard.

673
00:36:47,631 --> 00:36:50,466
That canary you ate
is going to spoil your dinner.

674
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,592
What's going on?

675
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:54,052
Your mom and I secured a place
on Martha's Vineyard.

676
00:36:54,135 --> 00:36:56,553
- That's great!
- I thought you lost your old place.

677
00:36:56,637 --> 00:37:00,848
We did, but this afternoon we found out
that Arthur Roundtree had died.

678
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:02,099
He'd been drinking.

679
00:37:02,141 --> 00:37:04,559
So we got on the phone
and snatched that place up.

680
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:08,187
- It's a fine piece of property.
- Much better view than our usual place.

681
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:11,189
Both of you are going to hell.
I hope you know that.

682
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:13,274
At least we'll be well-rested.

683
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,775
Touche.

684
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:17,694
- I am so thrilled about this.
- I'm glad.

685
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:20,821
The two of you must come up
for the weekend. It is so lovely.

686
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,240
- Rory would just love it.
- Can we go for a weekend?

687
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:25,658
We'll see how much Valium
Aunty Sookie can lend me.

688
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,035
The only drawback is that
we had to rent the place furnished...

689
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,996
and Arthur had dreadful taste.
Remember the library, Richard?

690
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:36,624
Pink and green. It was just horrible.

691
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:40,960
- He's dead now, so he got his.
- Lorelai, you're being morbid.

692
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:42,837
- I'm being morbid?
- New subject, please.

693
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:45,380
Joan and Melissa Rivers here think
l'm being morbid.

694
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:49,383
- Rory, what's new in your life?
- Nothing. Just school, homework.

695
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,051
- Aprons.
- Do not go there.

696
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,761
- What does she mean?
- Nothing, I was just teasing her.

697
00:37:53,845 --> 00:37:55,095
- About aprons?
- Yeah.

698
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,139
- I don't understand.
- It's not important.

699
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:58,390
Then humor me.

700
00:37:58,474 --> 00:38:01,059
Nothing. Rory dressed up in a cute apron
the other day.

701
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:02,434
I was teasing her about it.

702
00:38:02,518 --> 00:38:04,936
Why did you get dressed up in an apron?

703
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:09,564
We've decided to give up
on that pesky Harvard dream...

704
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:11,566
and focus on something more realistic.

705
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,694
Mom, Dad, Rory's decided
to become a maid, just like I was.

706
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:19,739
Is that funny? Did she think it was funny?

707
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:22,865
- What made you say such a thing?
- And in front of Rory?

708
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:26,160
- I was kidding.
- God, my heart stopped.

709
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:29,662
Why don't you tell them about your bird?
That's a safe subject.

710
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:31,998
- Your bird?
- Yeah, it's for school.

711
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,833
Each of us has to follow a chick
through its growth process.

712
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,543
Everything must be logged.
Eating and sleeping habits.

713
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:38,710
Houdini habits.

714
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:39,961
- She got out.
- She ran far.

715
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:41,921
- But she lived.
- She's a better bird for it.

716
00:38:42,005 --> 00:38:44,548
- Thank God Luke found her.
- Luke found her?

717
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:46,967
- What?
- Rory said Luke found her.

718
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:48,760
Getting me back for the apron thing?

719
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:53,096
- Did the bird get loose in Luke's diner?
- No, the bird got loose at home.

720
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,889
- Your home?
- Yes.

721
00:38:56,057 --> 00:39:00,310
- So, Grandpa, when's your next trip?
- Madrid, the twelfth.

722
00:39:00,393 --> 00:39:02,936
There's a nice edition of Cervantes
in it for you.

723
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,020
Gracias.

724
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:08,524
- What was Luke doing at your house?
- Look, there's no ice. I'll get some.

725
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:12,735
- I asked you a question.
- He was helping me find the bird, Mom.

726
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:14,153
- Really?
- Yes, really.

727
00:39:14,237 --> 00:39:16,196
And how did he know
the bird was missing?

728
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,865
Was he strolling by your house
and he heard your plaintive cries for help?

729
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:22,243
Or the helpless cheep
of a chick in trouble?

730
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,910
I called him, Mom, okay?

731
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,454
I called him and asked him to come over
and help me find the bird, okay?

732
00:39:27,538 --> 00:39:29,789
This man is always around
when you're in trouble.

733
00:39:29,873 --> 00:39:31,499
- He's a good friend.
- Please.

734
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:35,043
- Do we have to discuss this?
- I'm getting a little tired of being lied to.

735
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:36,336
Apparently we do.

736
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,297
This man was at Rory's birthday party.
He came to the hospital with you.

737
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:44,842
He's the male lead in every story you tell.
You go to the diner every single day.

738
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:48,303
I've seen how he looks at you,
the way you look at him. I'm not a fool.

739
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:49,512
Mom, please.

740
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:53,557
Why do you treat me like I don't have
a clue as to what is going on in your life?

741
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,558
Now l'm asking you, as a favor...

742
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,519
if you have any respect for me at all
as your mother, just tell me.

743
00:39:59,603 --> 00:40:01,729
Do you have feelings for this man?

744
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:06,900
I don't know.

745
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:10,360
Maybe I do.
I haven't given it that much thought.

746
00:40:12,195 --> 00:40:13,570
Maybe I do.

747
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:17,491
Thank you.
I'm glad you were finally honest with me.

748
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:21,243
Now we can discuss what on earth
you could possibly be thinking.

749
00:40:21,327 --> 00:40:23,119
Don't forget the ice.

750
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:41,591
So you're sure we need this many cans?

751
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:46,136
Yeah, you need enough for two coats,
touchups and little spots.

752
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,929
No, l'm not sure.

753
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:50,722
We got the paint, the brushes...

754
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:54,142
the tarps, and all the other stuff
the paint guy said we'd need.

755
00:40:54,226 --> 00:40:56,602
- So I guess we're ready.
- Yes, we are.

756
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:58,979
The only thing left to do
is figure out when.

757
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:00,313
- How about Friday?
- Friday?

758
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:03,440
You don't want this lying around.
I don't know if paint goes bad.

759
00:41:03,483 --> 00:41:06,777
But judging by the smell when it's fresh,
rotten paint would be gross.

760
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:08,402
Don't you meet your folks on Friday?

761
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:11,529
Yeah, but I can get out early
for a special occasion.

762
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:13,364
- Friday it is.
- Good.

763
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:19,077
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

764
00:41:19,161 --> 00:41:22,413
- Jeez, you think you got enough paint?
- I know, I tried to tell him.

765
00:41:22,496 --> 00:41:25,164
- So dinner. Thoughts?
- Let's have some.

766
00:41:25,207 --> 00:41:26,666
- How about Chinese?
- Sounds good.

767
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,667
I need to stop at the market and get fruit.

768
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:30,710
- Why?
- I think l'm getting scurvy.

769
00:41:30,794 --> 00:41:31,878
- Really?
- Yeah.

770
00:41:31,962 --> 00:41:35,172
That or a cold.
But, either way, I need some fruit.

771
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,677
- Damn motorcycles. They're a scourge.
- Yeah.

772
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:45,262
They're loud. They're dangerous.
We should ban them from town.

773
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:46,972
Maybe we should set up barricades...

774
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:50,308
and ban all unwelcome strangers
from crossing the border.

775
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,768
No, we couldn't do that.
That would be illegal.

776
00:41:52,852 --> 00:41:55,812
- Darn laws.
- Gotta get away from that noise.

777
00:41:58,314 --> 00:42:01,899
- Kill me and bury me with that bike.
- What is it, a Harley?

778
00:42:01,983 --> 00:42:04,693
That is a 2000 Indian 80 horsepower...

779
00:42:04,777 --> 00:42:07,945
five-speed, close-ratio
Andrews transmission. I wanna get one.

780
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:09,071
- No.
- Why not?

781
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:10,697
- You'd die.
- Oh, that.

782
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,997
- Hi.
- Nice shirt. Take it off.

783
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:29,211
Dad!

784
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:35,716
- This is great! What are you doing here?
- I'm here to see you.

785
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:39,551
And your mom, who's not saying anything
about as loud as a person can.

786
00:42:39,594 --> 00:42:41,386
- Hello.
- A word.

787
00:42:41,554 --> 00:42:43,972
Perhaps there's a phrase in my future.

788
00:42:44,055 --> 00:42:46,181
Okay, why is that man staring at me?

789
00:42:46,265 --> 00:42:49,809
That's Taylor Doose. He owns the market.
He knows all and sees all.

790
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:53,437
So, what's with the just showing up,
Mr. Spontaneity Guy?

791
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:56,022
My folks are in Connecticut,
so l'm here to see them.

792
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:59,191
On the way I thought l'd stop by
and surprise the Gilmore girls.

793
00:42:59,233 --> 00:43:00,400
Are you surprised?

794
00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:02,735
The teeniest feather
could knock me in the gutter.

795
00:43:02,777 --> 00:43:05,153
Where would somebody find
a place to stay here?

796
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:07,196
- You're staying?
- I'm thinking about it.

797
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:08,990
- Stay with us.
- Sweetie.

798
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,282
I don't think your mom wants...

799
00:43:10,366 --> 00:43:12,992
No, it's not that.
It's just that l'm still surprised.

800
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:14,410
Mom, please?

801
00:43:15,953 --> 00:43:17,787
Why not stay with us for a couple of days?

802
00:43:17,872 --> 00:43:19,498
Thanks. You won't even know l'm there.

803
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:21,499
- Hey, hop on.
- Hop off.

804
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,042
- Hop on.
- Hop off.

805
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,005
Hop on.
