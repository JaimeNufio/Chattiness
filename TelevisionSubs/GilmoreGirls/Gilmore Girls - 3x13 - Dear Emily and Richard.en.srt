1
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:05,793
Mom, I swear, it was Aunt Maureen.

2
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,476
Aunt Maureen would never hike up her skirt in public.

3
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:10,457
She would after half a gallon of eggnog.

4
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:13,279
Richard, who was the one who got drunk at our Christmas party

5
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:15,859
and hiked up her skirt in front of the Town and Country photographer?

6
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:17,754
I�m sorry, did you say something?

7
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:18,757
I don�t know about you, Mom,

8
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,734
but I�ve never felt so fascinating in my entire life.

9
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:22,740
I�m so sorry I�m late. Hi Grandma, Hi Grandma.

10
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,030
- Hello Rory. 
- Oh, now he closes the paper.

11
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,329
Hey, Mom, I stopped by the bookstore on the way here.

12
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:28,850
- You got them? 
- I got �em!

13
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:29,725
Got what?

14
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,906
Rory and I are starting to plan our Europe trip.

15
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,775
The day after graduation, we are gone.

16
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:35,511
Well, that sounds very exciting.

17
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:37,088
Lorelai, what are these?

18
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:38,036
Those are guidebooks.

19
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:39,657
"Europe Through the Backdoor."

20
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:42,716
"The Rough Guide to Europe." What kind of guidebooks are these?

21
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:43,730
The cheap kind.

22
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:46,653
They have all the good information about backpacking and staying in hostels.

23
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:49,468
Backpacking and staying in hostels?

24
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,087
Who�s backpacking and staying in hostels?

25
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:51,943
We are.

26
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,573
- No, you�re not. 
- What a ridiculous thought.

27
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:01,031
We are. We�re going to backpack around Europe.

28
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:04,045
Yes, I know, it�s fun to tease your grandmother, dear.

29
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,315
They�re going to backpack across Europe, Richard.

30
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:07,706
I heard, sounds delightful.

31
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,993
Perhaps we should join them.

32
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,444
That sounds wonderful. Tomorrow I�ll go out and buy some cutoffs.

33
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:14,861
Guys, we�re not kidding.

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,251
You�re telling me you�re seriously going to traipse across Europe

35
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:20,078
with your possessions strapped to your back

36
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,656
and sleep in a room with thirty other people?

37
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:23,042
- Yes. 
- No.

38
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,554
- Grandpa. 
- It�s not safe.

39
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:26,821
I forbid it. Call our travel agent.

40
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,629
But we want to be spontaneous.

41
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:31,557
Jump a train to Paris, head off to Spain.

42
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,960
Oh no, it�s raining in Spain.

43
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:35,025
But since the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain...

44
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:36,975
- Looks like Italy for us! 
- Mamma mia!

45
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:40,278
You can still travel around aimlessly and stay in a decent hotel.

46
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,409
We wanna do it cheap.

47
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:42,684
- We�ll pay. 
- No.

48
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:44,471
Grandma, it�s going to be fun, really.

49
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:45,798
Kids do this all the time.

50
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:47,886
Yes, but you�re not a kid, you�re a grown woman.

51
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:50,979
What are people going to think when they see a grown woman bunking down

52
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,453
with a bunch of twenty-year-olds?

53
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:55,516
Well, if the twenty-year-olds are cute, they�ll probably think, "Lucky!"

54
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:58,281
Grandma, don�t be upset. It really is going to be great.

55
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:01,809
What�s so traumatic about a night without a bed anyway?

56
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:06,309
My survey shows those who have had the opportunity to be a refugee for a night

57
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:09,535
have their perspectives broaden and actually enjoy the experience."

58
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:12,731
Richard, this book is encouraging them to sleep in a park like a squirrel.

59
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:13,846
It�s okay, Mom.

60
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:16,575
My first trip to Europe, I went to Paris and stayed at the Ritz.

61
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:18,450
I tell you what, if it�ll make you happy,

62
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,456
we�ll go to Paris and eat out of their dumpster.

63
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:21,742
All of this goes in there. Let�s move, we�re getting backlogged.

64
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:24,102
Tom, I brought over the nails you asked for.

65
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:25,632
Good. Get the guy�s lunch orders, will ya?

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,473
Already done.

67
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:29,012
You�re a good kid, Dean. You hardly bug me at all.

68
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:30,011
High praise.

69
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:31,542
Yeah, yeah, go, get the food.

70
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:33,789
- And don�t forget the pickles. 
- I wouldn�t dare.

71
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:37,343
Oh, what do I gotta say to get this crap inside where it belongs?

72
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:40,599
You got a language I�m not privy to? �Cause I�m a fast learner.

73
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:42,674
Dean-o, Dean-o, Dean-o.

74
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,529
If you grow any taller, I�m gonna have to get myself some mountain climbing equipment.

75
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:49,366
You�re getting dangerous to even walk near, you know that, Patty.

76
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:50,584
I�ve been told.

77
00:04:50,712 --> 00:04:51,870
You looking for Mr. Doose?

78
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:54,348
Oh, precious, no. I�m just looking.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,151
Okay. Well, enjoy.

80
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:00,543
Oh, I always do.

81
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:05,499
- Move. 
- What? Oh, sorry.

82
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:07,174
- What�s that? 
- It�s nothing.

83
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,203
- You reading? 
- It�s nothing.

84
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:10,974
- I never see you reading. 
- Will you just... I read.

85
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:12,622
- What are you reading? 
- I read, I read.

86
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,070
- What do you read? 
- Invoices, expiration dates.

87
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,211
I stand corrected.

88
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:20,511
"Hidden Romantic Gems of the Restaurant World." Well, well, well.

89
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,294
I would like my property back, please.

90
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,061
- Planning something special? 
- No, nothing special.

91
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,513
I�m just taking Nicole to dinner on Friday and I wanna find a place.

92
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:28,035
- A place you don�t normally go to? 
- Yes.

93
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,156
So a special place.

94
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:31,592
Will you stop saying that word, please? And yes.

95
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:32,668
Find anything good?

96
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,666
Every single description in here talks about tablecloths

97
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,390
and dish design, nothing about the food.

98
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,245
You are really going through an awful lot for this lawyer.

99
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:40,482
She�s not a lawyer. I mean, yes, she�s a lawyer,

100
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:43,749
but she�s also a lady, and a very nice lady who probably expects good food

101
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:46,529
with her fancy plates and sparse yet elegant d�cor.

102
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,943
You�re pathetic when you�re in love.

103
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:50,276
I�m not in love, I�m dating. This is what you do when you�re dating.

104
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:51,399
It�s not what I do when I�m dating.

105
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,881
Rory�s a lucky girl. Work. I�m going upstairs.

106
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,309
Fine, but if a horse-drawn carriage shows up here,

107
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:57,953
my throwing up will be eternal.

108
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:02,904
I gotta place an order.

109
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,864
- Talk into the clown. 
- I am.

110
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,254
What do you want?

111
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:12,755
Six burgers, three with cheese -- two cheddar, one Swiss.

112
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:16,192
Two plain, one with chili, cheese and onions on the side.

113
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,176
- Your memory�s that good? 
- You�re screwing with me.

114
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:21,082
- I�m placing an order. 
- For all of Connecticut?

115
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,766
For the construction crew next door.

116
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:25,372
Oh, you�re Taylor�s errand boy now.

117
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:26,933
And you�re Taylor�s waitress.

118
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:28,920
- Say that a little closer. 
- I thought you had a girlfriend.

119
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:32,289
- Give me your order and get out. 
- Service with a smile.

120
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:36,420
Six burgers, three cheese -- two cheddar, one Swiss.

121
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:40,114
Two plain burgers, one chili burger with cheese and onions on the side.

122
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:43,620
Three ham on ryes - one mayo, one mustard, one combo.

123
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,940
- A combo means mustard and... 
- I know what a combo means.

124
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,490
Sorry, guess that confused look is just how your face is.

125
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:49,965
Do you wanna talk about this outside?

126
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:51,154
Just as soon as I�m finished.

127
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:55,151
Four hot dogs. Two egg salads on white. One chicken salad on wheat.

128
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:58,449
A chef's salad with ranch. Five fries. Five onion rings.

129
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,543
Two chips. Extra pickles.

130
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,049
- On what? 
- Excuse me?

131
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:04,465
- What are the extra pickles on? 
- On the side.

132
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:06,508
On the side of what? On the side of the burgers,

133
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:08,550
on the side of the sandwiches, or on the side of the road

134
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,425
where the ditch I�m gonna dump your body into is?

135
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,750
- Just make sure there�s enough for everyone. 
- Fine.

136
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:16,416
- Aren�t you gonna read it back? 
- Nope.

137
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:20,605
Okay, but these men were hired by Taylor,

138
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:23,430
which means if they aren�t satisfied with their orders, they will send them back.

139
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:25,663
And they will continue to send them back until they are happy,

140
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,768
which means you could be making this order until you die.

141
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,042
Six burgers, three with cheese � two cheddar, one Swiss.

142
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:36,447
Slower, please. I�m checking them off as we go.

143
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,357
Two plain burgers, one chili with cheese and onion on the side.

144
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,810
Hey, it�s your party, we just want you to be happy.

145
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:50,789
Okay. No problem.

146
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,589
All right, I�ll talk to you then.

147
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:56,370
Ridgemont called.

148
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:57,732
No.

149
00:07:57,963 --> 00:08:00,925
He�s changing his mind about the theme for his retirement party again.

150
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,504
- No! 
- We have to call the florist.

151
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:04,486
But this is the fourth theme he�s picked.

152
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:06,330
He had the fishing one,

153
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:09,407
and the Kentucky Derby with the chocolate horsies,

154
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,962
and the Tibet with the Richard Gere pictures everywhere.

155
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:12,549
I know.

156
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:14,870
And he promised that the golf would be the last one.

157
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,758
He decided that golf was dull

158
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:18,245
and he doesn�t want to be remembered as dull.

159
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:20,031
Would he like to be remembered as limping,

160
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,822
because I can be a fabulous help with that.

161
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:23,978
Hey, guys...

162
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:27,675
I�m sorry, I�m really sorry.

163
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:31,039
Here�s an idea � it�s a retirement party, yes?

164
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,193
Okay. So what happens after you retire? You die.

165
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,765
- He changed his mind. 
- Again?

166
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:38,050
So, why don�t we dig a big hole,

167
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:40,588
throw him in, hand everybody a shovel,

168
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:42,298
they take turns covering him up.

169
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:43,978
We go inside, have dinner,

170
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:45,987
the wife gets used to eating alone...

171
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,603
We are not going to bury him alive.

172
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:50,666
Well, fine then. What is the new theme?

173
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:52,172
He is calling me back at four.

174
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:55,740
I got the flags and... he changed his mind again.

175
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:58,638
He�s worse than my mother at the Glory of Easter T-shirt stand.

176
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:02,499
- You kept the receipt, I hope. 
- Yup.

177
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,824
Good God, this party is gonna be the death of me.

178
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,544
- Or someone. 
- Go call the florist.

179
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:08,255
- You�re stressed. 
- You�re observant.

180
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,912
Well, I was going to save this for later,

181
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:12,104
but you look like you need it now.

182
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:13,124
What�s that?

183
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:17,778
I have been cordially invited to Sherry Tinsdale�s C-section.

184
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:19,237
No way!

185
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,340
Friday, February seventh, six o�clock p.m.

186
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,757
Join the girls for a toast, a hug,

187
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:27,927
a wave to the mommy as they wheel her off, dinner at Sushi Sushi,

188
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,625
and then back to the hospital for a formal viewing

189
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:34,583
of brand-new baby Georgia. RSVP at your earliest convenience.

190
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:38,803
P.S. -- gifts are not necessary, but always appreciated.

191
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:41,052
- I don�t even know where to start. 
- I knew you would like it.

192
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:43,709
- You have to RSVP to a C-section. 
- And bring a gift.

193
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:45,521
I wonder if Laura Mercier makes Demerol.

194
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,416
- You wanna keep it? 
- Oh, yes, please.

195
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:48,676
But don�t lose it. I need the phone number.

196
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,672
So, are you going?

197
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,039
Well, I don�t know.

198
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:54,773
I mean, I know it�s weird, but I kind of wanna see Georgia.

199
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,981
She�s sort of my sister.

200
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:57,666
She�s more than sort of your sister.

201
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:00,524
I just think it would be cool to meet her the night that she�s born.

202
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:01,813
It�s a good story to talk about.

203
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:03,638
You should go.

204
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,112
I should, shouldn�t I?

205
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,769
And you should take pictures and wear a hidden microphone

206
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,274
�cause I wanna hear everything.

207
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:11,307
- I�ll see what I can do. 
- Oh, shoot.

208
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,467
Sook...

209
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,385
God!

210
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,159
I just need to go on record that a grown man

211
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,443
should not throw himself a Beanie Baby retirement party.

212
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,221
Just hold your breath this one actually takes.

213
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:30,395
And how is Sookie supposed to plan a Beanie Baby menu?

214
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,419
- Lots of beans. 
- I think this is ridiculous.

215
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:35,070
Angel face, you need to learn that there are going to be times in your life

216
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:37,139
when you have to do ridiculous things for money.

217
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,603
If you�re Adrian Zmed, that includes everything

218
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,272
that ever happens in your whole career.

219
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,389
Oh Rory, come on. Did you order from Amazon again?

220
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:46,811
�Cause we�re going to get your books their own house.

221
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:47,755
I didn�t, I swear.

222
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,182
- It�s from my mother. 
- What is it?

223
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,168
It�s heavy. Must be her hopes and dreams for me.

224
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,473
I thought she discarded those years ago.

225
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:00,411
Just drop the Beanies by the door.

226
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,139
"Girls, here are some travel books

227
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:06,541
I stumbled across in your father�s study.

228
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:09,387
I thought they could help in the planning

229
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,773
of your European adventure." She�s insane.

230
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:12,941
We have travel books.

231
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,686
No, sweetie, these aren�t our kind of travel books.

232
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,950
These are Paris and Nicky Hilton�s kind of travel books.

233
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:18,732
"Selected Hotels of Europe,"

234
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:24,016
"Hotels, Restaurants and Inns of Great Britain and Ireland, 1986",

235
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:27,540
"Myra Waldo�s Travel and Motoring Guide to Europe, �78."

236
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,802
Wow, these will be an enormous help in planning our trip.

237
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,553
Hey, you wanna go see the Berlin Wall?

238
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,413
Sounds great.

239
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:33,868
My God, I remember these books.

240
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:36,301
I think the only person in my house who ever read them was me.

241
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:38,296
This hotel is five hundred dollars a night.

242
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,022
Five hundred dollars a night twenty years ago.

243
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:41,421
What could a hotel possibly have

244
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:42,721
that would make it five hundred dollars a night?

245
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:44,052
An English menu?

246
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,526
Christopher, stop it, I�m trying to open the door.

247
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:51,911
Graceful and lovely they enter.

248
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,208
- Is she home? 
- I don�t know.

249
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,035
- Mom, are you home? 
- Mom, are you home?

250
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,627
- Shh, she�ll hear you. 
- So, she likes me.

251
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:58,707
Oh, that�s right.

252
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:00,861
Mom, it�s me, Lorelai, I�m home!

253
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:02,946
I�m home and I�m taking my sweater off.

254
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,398
I�m taking my sweater off and dropping it on the floor.

255
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:07,959
I�m dropping it on the floor and walking away from it.

256
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:10,254
I�m walking away from it and leaving it on the floor,

257
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:13,290
and in two years I�m gonna register Democrat.

258
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:16,423
- Looks like no Emily. 
- Where�s Sofia?

259
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:17,550
- Fired. 
- Already.

260
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:18,892
She touched the Baccarat unicorn.

261
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,866
- My God, is she insane? 
- Apparently so.

262
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:23,960
Okay, so, to recap, there�s no Emily and there�s no Sofia.

263
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,223
And there�s no supervision whatsoever.

264
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,200
- What will we do? 
- Let�s celebrate.

265
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,039
Celebrate what?

266
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:30,447
- No more midterms. 
- Hear, hear.

267
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,404
- Okay, I say that we drink to it. 
- Hear, hear.

268
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,440
- Scotch, vodka, or gin? 
- Hear, hear.

269
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,652
And put a cherry in it.

270
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,064
It looks like the Gilmores are planning a trip again.

271
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:41,456
Where to this time?

272
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:43,733
Someplace fabulous where they�ll stay at a fancy hotel

273
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:45,793
with a lot of other rich Americans so they won�t have to talk

274
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:47,441
to anyone who actually lives in that country.

275
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,539
"Myra Waldo�s Travel and Motoring Guide to Europe."

276
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:51,717
Hello Myra.

277
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,392
Oh God, I hope they go over Christmas.

278
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,127
That would be as holly jolly as it gets.

279
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,276
Smooth.

280
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:00,555
Hey, guess what I decided �

281
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:02,977
- I�m not gonna go to college. 
- Are you serious?

282
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:04,913
I�m taking a year and I�m going to Europe.

283
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,948
I�m gonna backpack, train it, sleep on a bench, see the world.

284
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:10,499
And you�ve told Straub and Francine about your big plans, I�m sure.

285
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:11,522
Ah, it doesn�t matter.

286
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,950
I�m outta here the second that diploma�s in my hand.

287
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:14,933
Sounds good.

288
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,054
You�re coming with me.

289
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,339
- Oh, I am? 
- Yup.

290
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:19,226
I�m sleeping on a bench? Okay, how does that picture look to you,

291
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:21,107
�cause to me it looks like a big no.

292
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:22,603
Fine, you we get a room for,

293
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:24,396
and then I�ll just sleep on the bench outside.

294
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,285
- Much better arrangement. 
- So you�ll go?

295
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:28,173
Christopher, you�re supposed to go to college.

296
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:29,311
I�m supposed to go to college.

297
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:32,055
Then you�re supposed to join your dad�s firm where you�ll get a corner office

298
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:33,586
and big stick to shove up your butt.

299
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,743
Change of plans.

300
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,131
You can�t just change the plans.

301
00:13:36,243 --> 00:13:37,555
The plans came over on the Mayflower.

302
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:39,019
Come on, Lor. Let�s get out of here,

303
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,947
let�s get away from this place. Let�s take Myra and just bolt.

304
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:44,405
Leave a note on the dining room table. "Dear Richard and Emily,

305
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:46,273
I don�t belong here, I�m going somewhere else,

306
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,932
I�ll call you when I get there. Love, Lorelai.� How does that sound?

307
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:51,967
Well, the word "whoopee" comes to mind.

308
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,185
So, then, it�s a plan.

309
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:55,648
It�s a plan.

310
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,325
Hey, I want to sleep amongst thirteenth century tapestries

311
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,111
and chocolates made by local artisans.

312
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:07,543
Okay, then, it�s settled. We�re not staying at any place

313
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,571
that wasn�t built for Napoleon the third�s doctor

314
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,455
or doesn�t have a Chagall in the bathroom.

315
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:12,214
Hear, hear.

316
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,645
Now we just have to figure out how we�re gonna pay for it.

317
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:18,286
Hey, how good�s your organ grinding?

318
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:25,329
I called last night and I asked her

319
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:27,398
to talk me through the Korean War and she said she was busy.

320
00:14:27,485 --> 00:14:29,200
- Oh, she�s definitely got a boyfriend. 
- I know.

321
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:30,854
- I for one think it�s about time. 
- I agree.

322
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,328
It wasn�t healthy, all that non-dating.

323
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,447
It definitely didn�t help that whole skin thing she was going through.

324
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,370
How come she didn�t tell us?

325
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:37,014
I think she just wanted to make sure it was gonna take.

326
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:40,542
So, tell us, what�s this Jamie like?

327
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:43,337
You know, I really don�t feel like talking about Paris right now. Or ever.

328
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:44,987
Oh, come on, you know him, we don�t.

329
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:46,231
- Is he sexy? 
- Does he have a good car?

330
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,510
- How�s the trust fund? 
- How�s the profile?

331
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,067
- Will the prom pictures work? 
- How are his friends?

332
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,511
Yes. Is there spin-off potential?

333
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:53,578
- Whoops. 
- Bye.

334
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:55,324
Okay, everyone, gather around.

335
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:58,401
I have in my hand the 2002 Franklin Yearbook photos.

336
00:14:58,488 --> 00:15:01,479
I got copies for everyone, so let�s leave the Barney�s clearance sale reenactment

337
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:02,898
for another day, shall we?

338
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,141
And, please take note of the fact that the idea

339
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:08,499
of posing under the new school banner was a major, major success.

340
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:10,158
- Paris. 
- Yes?

341
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,500
- I�m sneezing. 
- What?

342
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:13,563
In the picture. I�m sneezing and my head is turned.

343
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:14,803
Oh, yeah, I noticed that,

344
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:17,115
but every picture had something wrong with it and I had to pick the one

345
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:18,853
that was the best for the largest number of people.

346
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,892
- We took ninety pictures. 
- What�s your point?

347
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:23,491
My point is in ninety tries, there wasn�t one other picture

348
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,064
that was good for the group and didn�t have me looking

349
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,519
like I�m in Cirque du Soleil.

350
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,114
Sorry. Life can play some cruel tricks sometimes.

351
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:31,173
Life had a little help from the Gellar camp this time.

352
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:33,496
We are not done.

353
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:39,103
- Hello? 
- Rory, hi, listen.

354
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:42,029
I just got the call and � hold on a sec. I�ll call him back.

355
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:43,450
I�m back, sorry. Where was I?

356
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:44,352
Who is this?

357
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:46,221
Maureen Rollins, Sherry�s friend.

358
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,016
Oh, yes, right, Maureen, I�m sorry, I...

359
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,126
Don�t worry about it. Listen, I know the invitation said

360
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,052
that we were all gathering at the c-section next week,

361
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:55,150
- but Sherry just went into labor. 
- What?

362
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,065
She screwed up, she�s in labor, and she wanted me

363
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,969
to call all the girls and beg them to get down to the hospital ASAP.

364
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:01,596
It�s a big screw-up.

365
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:02,785
I guess.

366
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:03,962
- Can you come? 
- Well...

367
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:05,370
- You�re a child, right? 
- What?

368
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:06,031
School?

369
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:07,290
School, you have school?

370
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:09,062
Yes, I have school, but...

371
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:11,935
Is there anyway you could reschedule school just for today?

372
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:13,983
She completely screwed up, but she�s still our Sherry.

373
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:16,093
Well, I�m actually done with school now.

374
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:17,486
I could grab a train and...

375
00:16:17,598 --> 00:16:19,409
That would be the best, the absolute best.

376
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:22,001
You are a great kid. She�s at Boston Memorial.

377
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:25,457
I will meet you there. Listen, I have Graydon Carter on the other line.

378
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:26,870
- Who? 
- Graydon Carter.

379
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,468
- I have to go. 
- Okay, bye.

380
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:40,020
Please make sure the light is very soft.

381
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:41,797
I want a luminous quality.

382
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,179
I�m gonna have to see the young lady

383
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:44,592
before I can set the final lighting.

384
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,673
Yes, of course.

385
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:48,115
Arletta, did you call Lorelai?

386
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:49,805
Yes, ma�am. Twenty minutes ago.

387
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:50,843
And what did she say?

388
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:52,293
She said she was still getting dressed.

389
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:53,716
Do you want me to go up there again?

390
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:54,955
No, I�ll do it.

391
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,705
I swear, you�d think that it was my coming out portrait, not hers,

392
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,116
for the amount of concern she has about all of this. I�ll be right back.

393
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:03,179
Don�t scratch the floor.

394
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,285
Yeah?

395
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,793
Lorelai, the photographer needs you downstairs.

396
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:14,873
I�ll be there in a sec.

397
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,010
He needs you now, not in a sec.

398
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:21,248
- I don�t hear you walking toward the door. 
- Mom, please.

399
00:17:21,494 --> 00:17:22,631
- I�m coming in. 
- No.

400
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:25,652
I don�t have time for your attitude young lady.

401
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,541
This man is being paid by the hour.

402
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:28,888
Why aren�t you dressed?

403
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:29,472
I just...

404
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:32,150
I think the zipper�s too new or stiff or something.

405
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:33,097
Turn around, I�ll do it.

406
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:38,309
- Oh my God. 
- What?

407
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,454
It�s not the zipper, it�s the dress.

408
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:42,267
- It�s too small. 
- Are you sure?

409
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:43,676
Of course I�m sure.

410
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,288
It�s too small. How can it be too small?

411
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,835
We had a fitting three months ago.

412
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:48,652
- Have you gained weight? 
- No.

413
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,723
- Hold your breath. 
- I am.

414
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:52,447
- Hold your breath! 
- I am!

415
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:55,571
The only thing I can think of is the dressmaker

416
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:57,505
must�ve written the measurements down wrong.

417
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,333
What are we supposed to do now?

418
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,279
I certainly can�t take a picture of you like that.

419
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:02,150
Sorry.

420
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,750
I�ll just have to have him come back next week.

421
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,849
And I�m going to call that woman at the dress shop and give her a piece of my mind.

422
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,620
My God, is everyone in the world completely incompetent?

423
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:12,892
Put on your sweats and run around the block.

424
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,094
You�re gonna fit into the next dress no matter what.

425
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,145
Okay, I have five minutes to drink as much coffee as I can

426
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:34,192
before I have to drive to Hartford to spend the evening

427
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:36,200
with my mother alone and... who am I saying this to?

428
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:37,812
I was listening.

429
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:39,231
- Where�s Luke? 
- I don�t know.

430
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:41,746
Is he here? Is he coming back? How fresh is that pot?

431
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:43,137
I don�t know, I don�t know, it was sitting there

432
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,798
when I got here but that�s only been a minute so I don�t know.

433
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:45,786
Oh, thank God.

434
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:49,461
Hey, I desperately need a massive cup of coffee to go and...

435
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,530
- What happened to your face? 
- What do you mean?

436
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,973
- It�s visible. 
- Oh, I shaved.

437
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:55,509
- You going to the bank? 
- No.

438
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:56,221
- Funeral? 
- No.

439
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:58,233
- Drag club? 
- Let�s get you your coffee, shall we?

440
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:00,157
- Hey, isn�t that the sweater that... 
- Yes, it is.

441
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,647
- You look nice. 
- Thank you.

442
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,383
- What�s the occasion? 
- Oh, well...

443
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:05,867
Oh, it�s a girl...

444
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,630
Nicole, this is Lorelai.

445
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,458
Nice to meet you. I�m Nicole Leahy.

446
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:12,400
Lorelai Gilmore.

447
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:13,907
- Wow, you look nice. 
- Yeah, you, too.

448
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:14,940
So, you ready or should I sit down?

449
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:16,180
No, let�s go, I�m ready.

450
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:18,075
Oh, I�m sorry. I�ll just...

451
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:19,774
Oh, hey, Luke...

452
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:20,547
She�s a lawyer.

453
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:21,428
So what?

454
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:23,456
- Luke! 
- Shh!

455
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:24,285
Hello? Yes.

456
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:26,743
No, I�m sorry, Monday�s not gonna work, it�ll have to be Tuesday.

457
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,825
Yes, well, your client breaking a contract is fairly annoying also,

458
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:31,043
but we�re all dealing with that.

459
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:32,800
Terrific to hear. Bye Michael.

460
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:35,257
Sorry. The phone is going off now.

461
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:36,896
It�s okay. Make as many calls as you want.

462
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,056
- Nice meeting you. 
- You, too.

463
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:46,214
As soon as I can. All right, bye.

464
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,134
- Maureen? 
- Yes?

465
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,419
I�m Rory.

466
00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:54,014
I�m Christopher�s daughter. You called me to come down.

467
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:56,267
Rory, yes, sweetie, thank God you�re here.

468
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:58,841
Sherry�s gonna be so happy to see you. She�s a basketcase.

469
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:01,028
- Well, who wouldn�t be, right? 
- Where�s everyone else?

470
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,206
- Oh, they�re working. 
- What?

471
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:04,258
We had all planned on next week, but Sherry screwed up,

472
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:05,651
so what can you do? Thank God you�re here.

473
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:07,545
She�ll be thrilled. She�s feeling a little abandoned.

474
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,794
Now, she�s right in there. Do not mention how fat she is.

475
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:12,068
For some reason, she�s extremely sensitive about that today.

476
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,227
Okay, kiss. I�ll call you later to find out how everything�s going.

477
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,241
Wait, where are you going?

478
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:18,012
I�ve gotta get back to work. I�m swamped today.

479
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,078
You�re leaving me here alone?

480
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:21,357
Believe me, I would love to stay hon � impossible.

481
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:22,750
What can I say? Sherry screwed up.

482
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:25,109
Anyhow, you�ll be fine. If you need anything, call.

483
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:26,497
I don�t have your number.

484
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,578
Sherry�s got it.

485
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,575
Sherry? It�s Rory.

486
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,389
Rory?

487
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:38,330
Oh my God, I�m so glad you�re here.

488
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:39,477
How are you?

489
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:41,244
This wasn�t supposed to happen now.

490
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:41,935
I know.

491
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:43,055
Christopher�s out of town.

492
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:45,093
I think Maureen called him and left a message

493
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,387
but it doesn�t matter because he�s not here. Where�s Maureen?

494
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,754
Oh, she had to go back to work, but she said she�d call later.

495
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:51,280
- She�s at work? 
- Yes.

496
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:52,504
I�m lying in a bed.

497
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,373
God knows what�s gonna happen.

498
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,857
You�re going to have a baby.

499
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:57,096
And she goes back to work.

500
00:20:57,614 --> 00:21:01,330
I would love to go back to work, but I can�t because I have to stay here.

501
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:03,138
Well, yeah, because you�re going to have a baby.

502
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,332
She�s not here.

503
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,482
None of my friends are here.

504
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,708
Christopher isn�t here. No one is here.

505
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,777
No one but you.

506
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:13,584
Thank God you�re here, Rory.

507
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,355
I don�t think that I could do this by myself

508
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,419
because this wasn�t supposed to happen until next week.

509
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:18,637
I wrote it down.

510
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:20,491
I wrote it down.

511
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,576
I wrote it down!

512
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:26,809
Boy, do you look thin.

513
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:33,424
Well, it�s a rare treat to have an evening alone

514
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,909
with my daughter uncoerced.

515
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:36,057
Yes, it is, isn�t it?

516
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:37,501
So Rory�s at the hospital?

517
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:41,176
Yeah. She�s gonna see her new half-sister fresh from the oven.

518
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,819
That�s about an unpleasant a description as I�ve ever heard.

519
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:45,769
- I thought we�d have martinis. 
- Very good thought.

520
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:47,049
- Olives? 
- Twist.

521
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,845
So how�s Rory feeling about Christopher�s new baby?

522
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:52,484
She�s very excited. It�s kind of cute.

523
00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:53,728
You should�ve gotten her a puppy.

524
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:54,439
Stop.

525
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:55,935
No maid tonight?

526
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,937
Leloni usually takes Sundays off,

527
00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:00,820
but she wanted to switch and seeing as it�s just you and I, I said yes.

528
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,376
Leloni, huh? Very exotic name.

529
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,795
She�s from Honolulu.

530
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:05,443
- Cool. Does she know Don Ho? 
- No.

531
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:06,246
- Charo? 
- No.

532
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:07,748
The C&H Pure Cane Sugar dancers?

533
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,733
Lorelai, please, we don�t have a buffer here tonight.

534
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:11,828
So who cooked dinner?

535
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:15,442
Please don�t tell me it�s you �cause we can always... diet.

536
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:18,606
Leloni made a roast before she left and I heated it up.

537
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:20,000
You did?

538
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,745
I even added a little wine to the pan to keep it from drying out.

539
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,054
Well, who died and made you Sara Moulton?

540
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:26,978
Drink this and be quiet.

541
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:29,452
So...

542
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:31,520
how long is Dad gone for this time?

543
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,411
Two weeks.

544
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:33,476
Didn�t he just come home last week?

545
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,342
Yes, he did.

546
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:36,241
So business must be pretty good?

547
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:38,664
I suppose. He has to work twice as hard as he ever did,

548
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,013
and I�m still not sure that he�s actually made a dime yet.

549
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:44,193
However, he does see to be having the time of his life, so what can you do?

550
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,126
Nothing, I guess.

551
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,300
Hey Mom, can I ask you something?

552
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,314
Of course you can.

553
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:50,855
What do you do while Dad is gone?

554
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:52,381
I do all sorts of things.

555
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:53,271
Like what?

556
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,649
I keep this house running.

557
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,989
And I have my DAR meetings

558
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,888
and there�s always a thousand calls to make.

559
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,857
I have functions and fundraising events to organize. A million different things.

560
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,255
Okay, but what do you do at night?

561
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:05,126
Excuse me?

562
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:07,256
I mean, you don�t organize functions at night, do you?

563
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:08,821
What are you insinuating?

564
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:10,302
I�m not insinuating anything, Mom.

565
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,385
I�m just trying to find out a little bit about your life.

566
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:15,366
Your father calls every night at nine o�clock and we talk.

567
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,546
So, you spend fifteen minutes talking to Dad

568
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,471
and then you hang up the phone and you �

569
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:23,292
what? Watch television?

570
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:24,986
I don�t watch that much television.

571
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:28,402
I don�t find forensic work quite as fascinating as the rest of the world.

572
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:30,415
But you have cable, right? I mean, you could watch movies.

573
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:33,394
Yes, but I never know where the maid puts that guide they send you,

574
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:36,488
so I always wind up turning it on after a movie has already started

575
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,361
and I don�t like to come in on the middle of things.

576
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:41,039
But you could tape the movies, or get a DVD player.

577
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:42,535
I don�t need a DVD player.

578
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:45,310
Why not? Then you could buy all those musicals you love

579
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:47,429
and watch them whenever you felt like it.

580
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,119
I�m not an invalid, Lorelai.

581
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:50,757
Of course you are, Mother.

582
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:52,156
Why else would I suggest a DVD player?

583
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:53,773
I can fill my time all by myself

584
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,230
and I�d like you to drop this conversation right now.

585
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,248
Where are you going?

586
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,523
We�re going to eat.

587
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:03,215
Just because you leave the room

588
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:04,920
doesn�t mean the conversation�s over.

589
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:08,197
I started the conversation. The conversation�s in me.

590
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,932
Therefore, when I get over there,

591
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:12,058
the conversation�s just gonna start up again.

592
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:17,126
This is unbelievable.

593
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:19,089
Absolutely unbelievable.

594
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,860
- I feel sick. 
- Everything�s gone.

595
00:24:20,972 --> 00:24:22,780
It�s been tossed right out the window.

596
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:24,567
Stop crying.

597
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:25,842
Here Francine, drink your water.

598
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,721
We all need to calm down. Getting upset isn�t going to get us anywhere.

599
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,183
What do we tell people?

600
00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:31,716
Who needs to know?

601
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,046
What do you mean, who needs to know?

602
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:34,485
You don�t have to yell at me, Straub.

603
00:24:34,552 --> 00:24:36,375
Everybody has to know, Emily.

604
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:38,823
Everybody will know. We can�t pretend this didn�t happen.

605
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:40,723
- You could send her away. 
- Excuse me?

606
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:42,827
Aren�t there places that take girls like that?

607
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:44,133
Girls like what, Francine?

608
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:45,085
Girls in...

609
00:24:46,637 --> 00:24:48,889
I can�t handle this, I can�t handle this at all.

610
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,307
Stop crying, dammit.

611
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,575
Christopher is just as much to blame as Lorelai is.

612
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:54,379
- Like hell he is. 
- They are in this together.

613
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:55,249
I don�t see why.

614
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:57,942
Why should Christopher sacrifice everything we�ve planned for him just because...

615
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:00,364
Choose your words extremely carefully, Straub.

616
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:03,344
Emily, you know we love Lorelai, you know that.

617
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,551
But Christopher�s so young, he�s a baby.

618
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:08,208
Lorelai�s not exactly collecting social security.

619
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,457
Why doesn�t she get rid of it?

620
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:11,101
- What? 
- Straub.

621
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,164
- It�s an option. 
- It certainly is not an option.

622
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:14,813
- Why not? 
- Because I say so.

623
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,528
Then what the hell are you suggesting, Emily?

624
00:25:16,621 --> 00:25:18,424
What�s your great solution to this problem?

625
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,606
They will get married,

626
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:20,911
they will live here,

627
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:23,148
and Christopher will go to work at my company.

628
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,367
That is the solution.

629
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:26,226
Now, we have a plan

630
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:28,475
so we can all stop talking about it.

631
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:31,342
Please excuse me, I have work to do.

632
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,236
I think Richard�s plan sounds very sensible.

633
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,347
I just have one question � why his company?

634
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:40,112
What do you mean, his company?

635
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:41,439
Well, I have a law firm.

636
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:42,468
Christopher could go to school.

637
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,133
I know we�re all upset here folks,

638
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:45,893
but maybe we should ask the kids what they think.

639
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:47,900
Lorelai, Christopher, anything to add here?

640
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,150
Quiet, they�ll hear you.

641
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:52,289
Not likely. I don�t know how much longer I can just sit here like this.

642
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:53,563
It�s okay, let them talk.

643
00:25:53,656 --> 00:25:54,936
They�re talking about us.

644
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,590
They�re trying to figure out what to do.

645
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:58,260
What to do with our lives � our lives!

646
00:25:58,346 --> 00:26:00,206
Yours and mine and... its.

647
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:01,402
We�re gonna need their help.

648
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,576
We can take care of ourselves.

649
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:04,500
- How? 
- We�ll figure it out.

650
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,025
It�s okay. It sounds okay.

651
00:26:07,153 --> 00:26:08,051
What sounds okay?

652
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:09,898
You know, working for your dad, living here.

653
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:11,557
- It sounds okay. 
- Chris, no!

654
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,590
What about Europe? What about sleeping on a bench in Paris?

655
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,377
- We can�t do that now. I have to get a job. 
- No!

656
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:16,774
- I have to make money. 
- No!

657
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,544
It�s okay, really.

658
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:22,516
You�re not even listening to each other.

659
00:26:22,604 --> 00:26:24,861
Oh, for God�s sake Francine, shut up!

660
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:27,074
So, we�ll see you next Friday at three.

661
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,118
And once again, sorry for the short notice. Okay, bye.

662
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:32,043
Great, who�s next?

663
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:33,850
Sheldon Harnick.

664
00:26:34,071 --> 00:26:35,249
Try and set him for Wednesday.

665
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,219
Oh, and don�t tell him I�m pregnant. He hates pregnancy.

666
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:39,556
Oh, how about a plumbing problem?

667
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:40,379
Sounds good.

668
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:42,652
Okay, so how are we doing?

669
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:44,598
I�m not sure.

670
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:47,262
Don�t be nervous. Everything�s going to be just fine.

671
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:49,610
I just wanted to check on you and to see who�s going to be

672
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,163
with you in the delivery room while it�s happening.

673
00:26:51,265 --> 00:26:53,599
Oh, my fianc�s on his way. He�s on his way, right?

674
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,553
Yes, he�s on his way.

675
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:56,713
Okay, so when he gets here, he�ll come in with me.

676
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,249
And if he doesn�t get here in time?

677
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,544
Then we�ll just have to wait.

678
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:01,408
I�m afraid that�s gonna be a little tough to arrange.

679
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:02,785
Once it starts, that�s it.

680
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,482
Okay, well, then I guess it�s Rory.

681
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:07,875
Right?

682
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:11,588
Absolutely.

683
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,298
Okay, then I�m gonna get you a gown

684
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,679
and some gloves so you�ll be all set in case you have to go in.

685
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,793
- That sounds great. 
- I�ll be right back.

686
00:27:20,328 --> 00:27:21,481
Okay, where were we?

687
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,100
Listen, Sherry, I really need a cup of coffee.

688
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,235
Would you mind if I ran out really quick?

689
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:29,437
Oh, no, go ahead. I�ll make the next few calls myself.

690
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:37,706
- Hello? 
- Mom, they�re giving me gloves!

691
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:38,812
What are you talking about?

692
00:27:38,935 --> 00:27:41,531
I don�t want gloves, I don�t want a gown, I don�t wanna be in there.

693
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:42,360
In where?

694
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,490
- In the delivery room with Sherry. 
- What?

695
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,062
Dad�s not here yet and she�s freaking out

696
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:47,603
and she told the nurse I�m going in and...

697
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:48,817
Where are her other friends?

698
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:50,927
They had to work. I�m here all by myself

699
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:53,440
and I�m trying very hard to be calm but I�m starting to feel nauseous,

700
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:56,380
and the hospital has a smell, and there are noises,

701
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:59,217
and those gowns do not stay closed and I�ve seen a lot of butts today! And...

702
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,497
Okay, sweetie, calm down.

703
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:02,115
- I need you. 
- Rory.

704
00:28:02,228 --> 00:28:04,255
I need you, I need you here, I need you now.

705
00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:06,964
I cannot do this alone. I need my Mommy,

706
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:08,525
and dammit, I don�t care who knows it!

707
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,307
- What hospital is it? 
- Boston Memorial.

708
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,350
- I�ll be right there. 
- I really, really like you.

709
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:14,393
Tell Sherry to keep her legs crossed �til I get there.

710
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:16,719
- Does that work? 
- No. Bye.

711
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:19,622
Mom, I gotta go, I�m sorry. Dinner was great.

712
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:20,768
Where are you going?

713
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:23,789
Sherry�s freaking out and Rory�s the only one with her,

714
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:24,885
so I�m going to the hospital.

715
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:28,796
You�re going to be with Rory�s father�s girlfriend while she has his baby?

716
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:31,623
Gee, Mom, I can�t at all tell what your opinion on that might be.

717
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:32,586
Why would you do this?

718
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:35,289
This woman pulled Christopher away from you, away from Rory.

719
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:37,461
She destroyed any chance you might have had...

720
00:28:37,526 --> 00:28:39,442
Rory asked me to come, that�s why I�m going.

721
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:41,567
I don�t understand what Rory�s doing there either.

722
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:42,807
She�s going to have a sister.

723
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:43,635
Half-sister.

724
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:45,500
Thank you for a lovely dinner. I�ll see you next week.

725
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:24,555
- Are you done? 
- Yes.

726
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:26,951
Okay. Is anyone with you, hon?

727
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:27,688
No.

728
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,717
Someone will be up to get you in just a second.

729
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:30,618
Thanks.

730
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:02,666
Excuse me, Sherry Tinsdale�s room please?

731
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:03,909
- Right through there. 
- Thank you.

732
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:05,820
Mom!

733
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:08,083
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

734
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:10,597
You�re welcome, and I will be holding this over you for the next ten years.

735
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:11,877
- What are you doing? 
- Xeroxing.

736
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:12,477
What?

737
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,420
Sherry had some status reports she promised to fax to people by tomorrow

738
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:18,001
but she didn�t bring enough, and so I�ve been trying to find a Xerox machine.

739
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,850
I finally conned someone in ICU into letting me use theirs.

740
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:22,640
- I haven�t found a fax machine yet, but... 
- Okay, come on.

741
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:24,442
- I have to fax these. 
- Let�s go.

742
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,543
But we have a deadline.

743
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:29,229
Yes, I�m having them faxed over right now.

744
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:30,668
Yes, that�s right.

745
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:33,335
I�m not sure if the numbers I have are the numbers that you have.

746
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:34,893
That�s right, that�s bad.

747
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,292
I think you should, too.

748
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:41,160
- Did you get those things faxed? 
- Sherry, hang up.

749
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:43,469
- No, I have to finish this call. 
- Just say goodbye.

750
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:44,785
- But... 
- You�ll call �em back.

751
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:46,930
Hi. Sherry�s gonna have to call you back.

752
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,208
- Yeah, I promise. Okay, goodbye. 
- No, that was work.

753
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:53,592
Sherry, you really shouldn�t be working right now.

754
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:55,477
I can�t just stop everything because I�m...

755
00:30:56,127 --> 00:30:58,820
Having a baby. Admitting it is the first step, honey.

756
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:00,586
I�m not ready. I had it planned.

757
00:31:00,785 --> 00:31:02,640
- Christopher was supposed to be here. 
- I know.

758
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,032
I don�t know what to do.

759
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:06,315
The first thing you have to do is calm down and stop working.

760
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:09,379
And the second thing is, you need to tell me why you�re sitting like that.

761
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,016
Maureen told me that Howard Stern said

762
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,558
that if you squat, it makes the baby come out faster.

763
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:16,050
Okay, as long as you have a sane reason from a reliable source.

764
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:17,698
- I�m scared. 
- I know.

765
00:31:17,894 --> 00:31:20,090
It�s scary, and it hurts like hell.

766
00:31:20,218 --> 00:31:22,419
And remember, when it comes out not to look at it too hard

767
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,902
until they give it a good cleaning, or you�ll think you gave birth to phlegm.

768
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,234
But, once they give it a good scrub, it�s just unbelievably cool.

769
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:30,034
Yeah?

770
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,043
And look how good they grow up. Not bad, huh?

771
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:35,810
I hope I get that lucky.

772
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:37,738
I�ve got a good feeling.

773
00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:40,054
Thank you.

774
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:42,834
Lorelai?

775
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:44,538
Yeah?

776
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:46,091
My ankles are starting to hurt.

777
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,698
Okay, grab an arm.

778
00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:54,118
I�m glad you�re here.

779
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:56,511
At this moment, you probably should be.

780
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:07,516
- She�s jogging in place. 
- Why?

781
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:10,158
I think she�s hoping to aerobicize the thing right out of there.

782
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:11,130
Should we stop her?

783
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,626
I tried. She almost took an eye out.

784
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:13,726
That can�t be good for the baby.

785
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,386
It�s probably no worse

786
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,618
than the guilt trip it�s gonna get for showing up a week early.

787
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,591
You do know it�s a girl.

788
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,417
Yes, I should probably stop calling it "it". Her "it".

789
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:23,860
I was just bringing you some coffee.

790
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,903
Thanks. Did you try calling your dad again?

791
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:28,704
His cell�s not in service or out of range or something.

792
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:31,100
You do know if he doesn�t get here, I have to go in with her.

793
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:31,801
Yes, I do.

794
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:32,820
I don�t want to go in with her.

795
00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:34,081
At least you know what�s gonna happen.

796
00:32:34,214 --> 00:32:36,441
I had the cheap seat before. My view was quite a bit different.

797
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:40,971
Hey, should we buy a camera or something?

798
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:41,602
For what?

799
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,353
If Dad doesn�t get here, shouldn�t we maybe...

800
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,931
No.

801
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:44,551
- But... 
- No.

802
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:45,258
- Mom. 
- No.

803
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:46,661
I just thought it would be nice.

804
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,324
Lor, Rory!

805
00:32:49,493 --> 00:32:51,306
Oh, thank God you�re here, Chris.

806
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,780
Has it happened? Did I miss it?

807
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:54,597
- No. 
- You have perfect timing.

808
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:56,784
I must�ve broken fifteen different laws getting here.

809
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:58,468
I don�t even remember where I left my car.

810
00:32:58,693 --> 00:32:59,743
I thought I wasn�t gonna make it.

811
00:32:59,831 --> 00:33:02,093
Take a breath, you did make it, and Sherry�s gonna be thrilled.

812
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:03,328
- Where is she? 
- Come on.

813
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:04,842
- Is this... 
- Yeah.

814
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:09,836
- Sherry! 
- Christopher, you�re here!

815
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:11,878
I can�t believe you�re here. I didn�t think you�d make it.

816
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:14,264
Are you kidding? You think I�d miss this.

817
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:17,368
No, I�m sorry. It�s just, I�m just in a lot of pain and I can�t think straight.

818
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:19,026
I take it this is your fianc�.

819
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:20,501
Yeah, this is him.

820
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:21,904
This is my Christopher.

821
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:23,948
Well, Christopher, are you coming in with us?

822
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,134
Try and stop me.

823
00:33:25,448 --> 00:33:26,717
Okay, let�s go then.

824
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,597
We�ll be right here, waiting.

825
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:32,360
Have fun.

826
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:34,613
Have fun?

827
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:36,230
Well...

828
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:42,207
Okay, this is a big pain and I�d really like it to go away, please.

829
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:43,020
Just breathe deep, honey.

830
00:33:43,097 --> 00:33:44,719
Breathing doesn�t help, can I hit you instead?

831
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:45,247
What?

832
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:47,297
Or pinch you really hard, �cause that might make me feel better.

833
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:48,216
No, you cannot hit me.

834
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:50,403
Can I bite you or pull your hair or use the Epilady on you

835
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,914
�cause I really need to do something.

836
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:53,584
Lorelai Gilmore!

837
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:55,161
Wheel this a little faster, please.

838
00:33:55,384 --> 00:33:58,601
Lorelai, you do not do this. You do not just leave a person a note.

839
00:33:58,699 --> 00:33:59,789
Okay, see the timing here?

840
00:33:59,949 --> 00:34:02,544
"Dear Mom and Dad, I�m in labor. See you later, Lorelai."

841
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,520
Emily, please, I feel ridiculous.

842
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:06,605
You�re having a baby � do you know that, Lorelai?

843
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:08,212
That explains the stomachache.

844
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,917
You do not leave your house when you are having a baby

845
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:12,302
without telling your mother. You say, "Excuse me, Mom.

846
00:34:12,365 --> 00:34:14,637
I�m having a baby, give me a ride to the damn hospital!"

847
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:16,676
Emily, please, I wore the wrong shoes for this.

848
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,785
Of all the things in the world I had a right to do,

849
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,788
driving my daughter to the hospital to give birth,

850
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:24,433
especially since she�s sixteen years old and doesn�t have her driver�s license yet,

851
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:25,908
is definitely one of them.

852
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,566
Ma�am, I need to wait out here, please.

853
00:34:27,689 --> 00:34:28,161
Why?

854
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:29,641
Because we�re going into the delivery room.

855
00:34:29,758 --> 00:34:30,520
I want to go in.

856
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,652
- No, Mom, please. 
- Yes, Emily, please.

857
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:34,653
Fine, we�ll be right here when you�re done.

858
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:35,477
Super.

859
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,408
And do not think we�re finished discussing this, young lady,

860
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,813
- because we are not! 
- Emily, let�s just sit here.

861
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:46,486
- I�m glad he got here. 
- Yeah. Me, too.

862
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,191
So I guess now we wait?

863
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:50,424
Yup, now we wait.

864
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,114
Kirk, how long are you gonna sit here?

865
00:34:58,382 --> 00:34:59,057
What do you mean?

866
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:00,347
It�s been four hours. Go home.

867
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,108
It�s boring at home. My TV�s broken.

868
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,808
- So do something else. 
- Like what?

869
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:04,843
- Read a book. 
- What book?

870
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,552
- Any book. 
- I�m gonna need a suggestion.

871
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:07,495
Moby Dick.

872
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:08,846
- That�s about the whale? 
- Yes.

873
00:35:09,718 --> 00:35:11,125
No. What else?

874
00:35:11,294 --> 00:35:12,646
Forget it, just sit there.

875
00:35:13,274 --> 00:35:16,572
So he just drove all the way to New York, picked up the cheese,

876
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,129
drove back. Nobody talked about it ever again.

877
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,377
Oh, God, I love cheese.

878
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,518
You would�ve gotten along very well with my father.

879
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:24,397
So, you want some coffee?

880
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:25,355
I would love some coffee.

881
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:27,284
Have a seat. Jess, coffee over here.

882
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:29,743
So, I have to say,

883
00:35:30,347 --> 00:35:31,770
I really hated that restaurant.

884
00:35:31,856 --> 00:35:34,500
Good, I like that we�re on the same page here.

885
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:36,779
I did, however, have a really good time.

886
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:39,113
Once again, I like that we�re on the same page here.

887
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:40,993
- Okay, coffee. 
- Thank you.

888
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,271
Did you have a good time?

889
00:35:42,386 --> 00:35:43,461
Yes, we had a really good time.

890
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:46,543
Okay, well, I�m going to go out for about an hour.

891
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:47,910
What are you talking about? It�s 11:30.

892
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:49,426
I know. I�m just gonna go out for about an hour.

893
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:50,398
- Where? 
- Out.

894
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:52,636
- Out where? 
- Out for about an hour.

895
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:53,690
What are you talking about?

896
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:56,087
I�m talking about going out for about an hour.

897
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,249
What � you need more time?

898
00:35:57,975 --> 00:35:59,754
Nicole, will you excuse me for a minute?

899
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:00,962
- Sure. 
- Okay.

900
00:36:13,076 --> 00:36:14,770
They have amazing communication.

901
00:36:27,629 --> 00:36:28,805
I guess I�m not going out for about an hour.

902
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:29,764
Say goodnight, Jess.

903
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:31,428
I don�t understand you, man.

904
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:32,692
My mystique is part of my charm.

905
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:34,514
You at least want me to take a walk around the block?

906
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:35,698
- Jess. 
- Take an extra long shower?

907
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:37,582
- Go upstairs. 
- Sorry, I tried.

908
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:45,958
Lor?

909
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:48,851
Are you a daddy?

910
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,975
Come on, come look.

911
00:36:52,354 --> 00:36:53,507
We�ll wake Rory later.

912
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:09,298
So how was it?

913
00:37:09,404 --> 00:37:12,568
Oh, man, Lor, in my wildest dreams, I never could�ve imagined.

914
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:17,617
I�ve never been that nervous or terrified or nauseous in my entire life.

915
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,277
It was like the most amazing thing ever in the world.

916
00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:23,229
It was like...

917
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:25,462
- You know. 
- Yes, I do know.

918
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,848
I�ve never seen anything like it.

919
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,421
And Sherry was great.

920
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:32,272
I�m flying, I mean it, I�m flying.

921
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:35,053
There.

922
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:39,007
- That�s my daughter. 
- I can tell.

923
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:39,886
How?

924
00:37:40,188 --> 00:37:42,988
I think she conned that one out of his blanket.

925
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:44,965
She�s perfect.

926
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:47,197
Rory was perfect.

927
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:50,582
She, however, is a good solid second.

928
00:37:51,755 --> 00:37:53,019
I just can�t believe it.

929
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:56,188
She�s beautiful,

930
00:37:57,618 --> 00:37:58,288
really.

931
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,519
Congratulations Christopher.

932
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:01,550
Thank you.

933
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,114
Thank you for everything.

934
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:07,402
Of course.

935
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:23,846
- She�s pretty. 
- She�s perfect.

936
00:38:25,073 --> 00:38:26,762
So, I guess we should get married.

937
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,794
I should wake Rory, don�t you think?

938
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:39,717
Yeah, she�d like to see this.

939
00:38:51,422 --> 00:38:55,148
I�ll get it, Leloni. You find out where that smell is coming from.

940
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:58,211
- Lorelai. 
- Hi, Mom.

941
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:00,158
What on Earth are you doing here? What is this?

942
00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:01,272
This is your new DVD player.

943
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:02,414
My what?

944
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,595
Plus, I picked up Singin� in the Rain, Funny Girl,

945
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:08,344
Easter Parade, An American in Paris, and as an added bonus,

946
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:11,294
the new classic dance series � Urban Cowboy, Saturday Night Fever,

947
00:39:11,406 --> 00:39:12,886
Grease, Footloose, and Flashdance.

948
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:16,348
Trust me, you�re gonna be cutting up your sweatshirts all weekend.

949
00:39:16,424 --> 00:39:17,076
Why did you do this?

950
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:18,088
�Cause I thought you�d enjoy it.

951
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:20,970
But I don�t know anything about a DVD player.

952
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:23,225
Mom, trust me, once it�s hooked up,

953
00:39:23,296 --> 00:39:24,923
all you�ll have to know is how to press play.

954
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,613
- But who�s gonna hook it up? 
- I am.

955
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,222
You know how to hook this up?

956
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:29,644
I know how to read an instruction manual.

957
00:39:29,788 --> 00:39:31,072
- Since when? 
- Please.

958
00:39:31,164 --> 00:39:32,845
Maybe we should get a professional.

959
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,668
I can do this. Just give me five seconds here.

960
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:37,474
Well?

961
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,125
Well, can you do it?

962
00:39:40,832 --> 00:39:41,865
Oh, just forget it.

963
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:45,907
Mom, please, just let me focus on this for one more second,

964
00:39:45,988 --> 00:39:49,445
and if I cannot do it, I�ll get a professional DVD guy in here to install it, okay?

965
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:52,303
I still don�t understand why you got me this.

966
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,221
I love this movie.

967
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:00,849
Lorelai, we�re leaving!

968
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:03,895
What do you know? She finally put Rory�s stroller away.

969
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:05,806
It�s the first time in a year I haven�t tripped over that thing.

970
00:40:05,912 --> 00:40:06,618
Where�s my scarf?

971
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:08,426
I told Tina to put everything out for you, Richard.

972
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:10,260
- Out where? 
- Look on the table.

973
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:12,139
You have to be more specific with her, Emily.

974
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:12,963
Fine, Richard.

975
00:40:13,034 --> 00:40:15,273
There should be a designated place to put things.

976
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:16,727
Whatever you say, Richard.

977
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:19,676
Lorelai, we are leaving! Please acknowledge that!

978
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:21,218
Where is that girl?

979
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,342
This is not the scarf I asked for.

980
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,067
It looks fine. Can you just wear it?

981
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:27,428
No, I�m gonna go back upstairs

982
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:29,426
and get the scarf I intended to wear in the first place.

983
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:31,242
I�m surprised at you Emily.

984
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,402
These are your friends we�re seeing tonight.

985
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:36,512
You would have thought that my appearance would be a priority for you.

986
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:39,502
I didn�t want to go to this thing in the first place.

987
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:41,555
I have an early meeting in the morning,

988
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:43,172
and I would much rather go to bed

989
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:46,705
and ignore the fact that the symphony has to reupholster its mezzanine this year.

990
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,867
Emily?

991
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:53,402
Emily?

992
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,801
- Well, can you do it? 
- I have no idea.

993
00:40:57,961 --> 00:40:59,415
Where are you going? Are you going to take it back?

994
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:00,551
- I�m going upstairs. 
- Why?

995
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:02,568
I think I should put this in your bedroom. That�s your best TV.

996
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:04,253
You just said you didn�t know how to hook that up.

997
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,262
I�ll figure it out.

998
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:08,396
But there are wires involved and connections and electricity.

999
00:41:08,478 --> 00:41:09,850
You could hurt yourself or set the house on fire.

1000
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,960
In your Easter bonnet...

1001
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:14,853
- You could ruin our television set. 
- ... with all the frills upon it,

1002
00:41:14,943 --> 00:41:19,399
you�ll be the grandest fella in the Easter parade.

1003
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:21,775
- I'll be all in clover... 
- I don�t like being ignored, Lorelai.

1004
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:27,049
... and when they look us over, we�ll be the proudest people in the Easter parade.

1005
