1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,711
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:06,130
I want to know
why you won't paint this place.

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:10,551
It's a pain. I'd have to close the place,
which I can't afford, or paint it at night...

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,512
which I don't want to do
because I hate painting.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,847
How about this?

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,639
I'll help you. I love to paint.

7
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:19,143
I guess maybe, if I had help.

8
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:23,021
- He's so cute. What's his name?
- Case Study Number 12.

9
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:24,314
Show yourself.

10
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:27,192
Molt or chirp or something.

11
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,068
This is so not funny.

12
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:33,322
Luke, Stella got out.
Could you come over and help me?

13
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:34,491
I'll be right over.

14
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:36,742
Out of all the people
you could have called...

15
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:40,204
that would have come and dropped
what they were doing, you called Luke.

16
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:42,248
Do you have feelings for this man?

17
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:43,416
Maybe I do.

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,460
- Don't you meet your folks on Friday?
- Yes.

19
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:48,295
But I can get out early
for a special occasion.

20
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,173
- Friday it is.
- Good.

21
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:54,927
Dad!

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,016
On the way, I thought I'd stop by
and surprise the Gilmore Girls.

23
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,142
Are you surprised?

24
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:04,227
The teeniest feather could knock me out.

25
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:06,689
Where would somebody find
a place to stay here?

26
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:08,899
- You're staying?
- I'm thinking about it.

27
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:11,360
- Stay with us.
- Why not stay with us for a few days?

28
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:13,112
Thanks. You won't even know I'm there.

29
00:01:13,195 --> 00:01:14,362
Hey, hop on.

30
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:18,242
Christopher.

31
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:29,210
- He looks good, don't you think?
- He looks good.

32
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:31,421
- I like his hair shorter.
- Shorter's nice.

33
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:33,882
- Do you think he'll stay long?
- Wouldn't bet on it.

34
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:35,841
Maybe we make him stay
a couple of weeks.

35
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:38,553
Absolutely, by weighting
him down with blankets.

36
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:40,221
I just want him to be comfortable.

37
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:42,473
He's gonna come and go
as he pleases, babe.

38
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:45,643
- I know.
- No amount of bedding will change that.

39
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,770
But he's never been
to Stars Hollow before.

40
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:48,854
I know.

41
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:51,648
That means something's
gotta be different, right?

42
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:55,027
Why don't you just enjoy
the time you've got, okay?

43
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:57,196
Yeah, okay.

44
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:02,117
I still think something's different though.

45
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,870
That is the worst shower I've ever had.

46
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,456
Water pressure keeps changing
every two seconds.

47
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,999
I'm fixing it tomorrow.

48
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,251
You stay away from my shower.

49
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:13,503
We ordered Chinese food.
It should be here soon.

50
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:15,588
- Good, I'm starving.
- Here.

51
00:02:17,257 --> 00:02:18,716
How is Diane?

52
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:21,302
Diane is ancient history.

53
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:24,138
When I met her at Easter,
you said she could be the one.

54
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:26,265
The one to be gone by Memorial Day.

55
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,310
- You're worse than Mom.
- Low blow.

56
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:32,021
- Can't keep a fella happy?
- I keep them very happy.

57
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,523
- Okay, don't get gross.
- You're upsetting us.

58
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,442
I'm gonna go study
before the food arrives.

59
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,486
- What? Tomorrow's Saturday.
- I know.

60
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,364
I like to get my weekend homework done
by Saturday night...

61
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:44,408
so then I can do extra-credit stuff
on Sunday.

62
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:47,870
Don't look at me.

63
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:51,373
She's a great kid.

64
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:53,750
I wish I could say
I saw more of myself in her...

65
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:55,711
other than we have similar left earlobes...

66
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:59,006
but she's all you.
Chip off the old perfect block.

67
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,382
Why the hell are you here?

68
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:03,343
- Behold the queen of the subtle transition.
- Why are you here?

69
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:06,304
You're gonna force me
to lawyer up, Officer.

70
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,640
Okay, look...

71
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,559
I've been making changes,
especially in my career...

72
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:13,227
and I've got all my ducks in a row.

73
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:14,771
You're opening a shooting gallery.

74
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:18,358
- I was tying up the loose ends of my life.
- Do they make that much string?

75
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:21,069
You've always had that quick mind.
It's annoying.

76
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:22,779
So you've been tying up loose ends.

77
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:24,572
I don't know what your dad told you...

78
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:27,366
but I'm on the verge
of a big success. It's for real.

79
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,577
I've got a company with actual cash flow.

80
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:32,997
I've got employees.
I've got an accountant, for God's sake.

81
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:36,417
He wears a tie and says words
like 'fiduciary' and 'ironically. '

82
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,004
- It's for real this time.
- I would love to believe it is.

83
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:44,508
Why does your dad
have more faith in me than you?

84
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,678
My father hit his head surfing Rincon
a couple of years ago.

85
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,472
- His judgment's a little off.
- So you have zero faith?

86
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:52,224
I've known you since I was six.

87
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:54,351
You're that guy
who crashed his new Porsche...

88
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,937
two hours after he got it
on his sixteenth birthday.

89
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:59,815
You were the girl
in the Pinky Tuscadero T-shirt next to me.

90
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,108
- Horrified.
- Think again.

91
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,860
- All right. Having a blast, then horrified.
- Listen to me.

92
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,404
I am. Your life is back on track,
that's great...

93
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:09,240
and I appreciate you coming here
for the very first time...

94
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:10,700
might I add, to tell us that.

95
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,828
- I didn't come here just to tell you that.
- No?

96
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,876
There's some things I need to do,
to take care of.

97
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,253
Like?

98
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:25,631
I haven't been enough a part of Rory's life.

99
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:30,428
So I wanna be around more,
to be another pal she can depend on.

100
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:33,556
I'm not crazy. I know there's already
a life going on here...

101
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,809
and God knows she doesn't need
anyone besides you.

102
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,728
But if you give me a chance...

103
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,813
I've always had the door
to Rory open for you.

104
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:43,733
- I know.
- You've hardly ever used it.

105
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,567
I wanna use it now.

106
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:48,820
- Is that okay?
- Of course it is.

107
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:51,991
Good.

108
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,953
I forgot to ask you. Tomorrow morning,
I'm going to a softball game.

109
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:58,663
- Do you wanna come?
- You play softball?

110
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,582
No.

111
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,877
- 'You play softball?' That's good.
- Okay.

112
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:06,296
- Whose game is it?
- It's my friend Dean's.

113
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,007
- Dean?
- Yeah, it starts at 9:00.

114
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,635
Sure, it's a date.

115
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,347
- She has a Dean?
- She has a Dean.

116
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,849
How did this happen?

117
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,810
A single-celled organism
crawled out of the primordial ooze...

118
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:23,271
and that pretty much led to Dean.

119
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,648
I need a beer.

120
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:29,777
Yes, dear?

121
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:34,698
There's a lot more
than an earlobe resemblance there.

122
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:38,660
Good. Thanks for the door thing.

123
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:41,621
Thanks for wanting it.

124
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:50,271
You got the next one, don't worry about it.

125
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,816
- So, which is your Dean?
- That's him over there.

126
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,735
Okay, we got two down.

127
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:57,279
- That's Luke.
- Luke's the diner guy?

128
00:06:57,362 --> 00:07:00,114
Yes, we eat there practically every day.

129
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:03,826
Looks like we got out Number Three
coming to the plate, guys.

130
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,537
I'd send your boys a little farther
into the field, Luke.

131
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:09,623
Why? Will they have
a better view of you whiffing?

132
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:13,294
The only way I'm not hitting it
is if you don't get it over the plate.

133
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:17,632
The truth of the matter is that
you can't pitch and you can't hit.

134
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:19,467
So this'll be a terrific matchup.

135
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,053
- Knock it off, Kirk.
- A historic lack of action.

136
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,179
Don't you have anything better to do?

137
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:26,431
What can I say, I'm addicted to comedy.

138
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:29,602
Half an hour they've been playing,
and it's tied zero-zero.

139
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:32,395
If you take this show on the road,
I've got a name for you.

140
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,941
Zero and Zero.
Dean Zero and Luke Zero, get it?

141
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:39,778
- Doesn't even resemble clever.
- I'm dumbing it down for you, Alfalfa.

142
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:42,948
- How long do these games last?
- Till they get tired.

143
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:45,325
Then they say
the first team to get a run wins.

144
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,660
Yeah, it's really professional down there.

145
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:50,080
Luke, does your husband
play softball, too?

146
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:51,957
All right, that's it.

147
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,293
I'm getting a page. I've gotta go.

148
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:03,968
Dean, this is my dad. Dad, this is Dean.

149
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:06,179
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

150
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:08,180
So, do you live in the area?

151
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:11,016
No, I had some time,
so I rode my bike out from Berkeley.

152
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,644
Really? What do you got?

153
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,229
- A 2000 Indian.
- I got an '86 Suzuki.

154
00:08:15,313 --> 00:08:16,522
- Nice.
- Yeah.

155
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,107
Dean, come on!

156
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:22,027
I gotta go. I'll see you later.
It was nice meeting you.

157
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,827
- So that was a Dean?
- That was a Dean.

158
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:35,457
Next run wins, all right?

159
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,751
Yeah, all right.

160
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:50,722
- Wow!
- Wow what?

161
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,976
Wow, I have never seen you two
enjoy a pleasant moment together.

162
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,102
Come on.

163
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:58,730
You have seen us
enjoy a pleasant moment.

164
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:01,315
- No, not ever.
- You're being absurd.

165
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,443
You have to admit,
they are few and far between.

166
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,070
Through no fault of mine.

167
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:09,949
I'm just saying it's refreshing.
It's not the usual'grr,'that's all.

168
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:13,494
Through no fault of yours?
I'm sorry, but you're the one that's so...

169
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:14,578
I don't know.

170
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:17,206
You do know,
or you wouldn't have started saying it.

171
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,583
- Just yourself, caustic.
- You mean obnoxious?

172
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,085
- Your words, not mine.
- Go to hell.

173
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:26,339
I'm just saying it is refreshing
to see the two of you just...

174
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:29,260
You, get in here and tell me
about the happenings at home.

175
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:32,220
I assume you mean,
'Did we get our toaster fixed?'

176
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:34,597
And no,
it's been cold Pop-Tarts for a week.

177
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,266
It's like a damn Dickens' novel.

178
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,020
I'm not talking about the toaster.
I'm talking about the man.

179
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:42,981
What's it like having him
around the house all the time?

180
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:47,193
It's a little weird.

181
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:50,113
We have fewer clean towels than usual.

182
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:53,408
Give me something.
Tell me how you feel. I'm dying here.

183
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:57,077
Honestly, I've been trying to figure out
how this makes me feel...

184
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,664
since he asked me
to take my shirt off the other day.

185
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:03,751
- Excuse me?
- No, it was a 'hello' kind of thing.

186
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:06,045
- Wow, he's smooth.
- Yeah.

187
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:08,965
I've not seen this man
since last Christmas, right?

188
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:11,259
We hear from him maybe once a week.

189
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:13,719
Then, all of a sudden,
he's here in my town...

190
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:16,972
and Rory's running around all excited.
He's sleeping on the couch.

191
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:19,933
I'm thinking,'Should I be mad?
Should I send him to a hotel?'

192
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:21,811
But then he smiles...

193
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,896
and it's Christopher.

194
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,816
No matter how many years go by
or how long I don't see him...

195
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:31,152
whenever I do, it's always Christopher.

196
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:34,740
- What do I do with this?
- Dunk. Go on.

197
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:37,992
This man knows all my secrets.

198
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:41,120
All of my bad-girl moments
happened with him.

199
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:44,332
My worst fashion choices,
my big-hair days...

200
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,835
wearing the Bonne Bell Lip Smackers
around my neck...

201
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:48,503
it was all with Christopher.

202
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:51,006
So, do you think you two will...

203
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:52,757
No.

204
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:55,259
- That's convincing.
- I don't know.

205
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:59,388
He wants to be more involved with Rory.

206
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,849
He wants to spend more time with her
and be a pal.

207
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,226
- It's about time.
- Yeah, that's good.

208
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,477
Yes.

209
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,688
- Lf it's true.
- And if it's not?

210
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,483
Then it's... Christopher.

211
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,736
This is the town flower shop.

212
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:18,449
Over there is a good pizza place.
That's the stationery store.

213
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:21,493
- And that's Al's Pancake World.
- Good pancakes?

214
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:24,162
- He doesn't serve pancakes.
- Okay.

215
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:27,708
He switched to international cuisine
a couple of years ago...

216
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,292
and dropped the pancakes.

217
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:32,545
He had already printed a million napkins
with the original name...

218
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:35,674
- so he just kept it.
- What kind of international cuisine?

219
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:38,843
He kind of hops around.
Last month, it was his salute to Paraguay.

220
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:41,220
- Anyone salute back?
- Not really.

221
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:44,432
Rory, honey.

222
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,976
- How are you, sweetie?
- Great.

223
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:50,938
- Miss Patty, this is my dad, Christopher.
- Your dad.

224
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:53,732
- Nice to meet you.
- You're Rory's father.

225
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:56,152
Well, well, well.

226
00:11:56,945 --> 00:12:00,865
You know, Christopher,
we're all like Rory's parents around here...

227
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:03,033
and I'm one of her mothers.

228
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:05,452
And since you're her father...

229
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:08,747
that would make us... a couple.

230
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,042
Couple of what, I don't know!

231
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:15,337
- Okay, well, we gotta be going.
- Yes.

232
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:18,757
- Come back and see me.
- I will.

233
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:21,259
Bye.

234
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:32,854
You must be Rory's father.

235
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:37,775
- Yes, I am.
- Taylor Doose, grocer to Stars Hollow.

236
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:39,694
Very nice to meet you.

237
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:43,197
- News travels fast around here.
- Yes, it does.

238
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:50,163
Bookstore. Good. Come on.

239
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:56,711
Christopher, Jackson Melville.

240
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:58,337
Hello.

241
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:01,215
I gotta tell you,
did they get your description wrong.

242
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,425
- Really?
- Yeah.

243
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,384
Much more George Clooney than Brad Pitt.

244
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:07,345
Don't you think he's much more
George Clooney than Brad Pitt?

245
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm going with
the Billy Crudup comparison myself.

246
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,058
- Really?
- Yeah.

247
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:14,603
I don't see it.
Maybe from the side. Do you mind?

248
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:17,481
What? No, not at all.

249
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,067
There's a little Crudup in there.

250
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:23,486
It's nice to meet you,
whoever you look like.

251
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,405
Nice to meet you, too.

252
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:29,075
I'm kidnapping you
and getting you out of here.

253
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,326
They all mean well.

254
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:32,870
I'm sure all lunatics
have the best intentions.

255
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:35,498
- I hear you like books.
- Why, yes, I do.

256
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,209
I would like you to pick something out
and let me buy it.

257
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:39,794
You don't have to buy me anything.

258
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:42,338
Come on, what's the book of your dreams
right now?

259
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:46,133
That would definitely be
The Compact Oxford English Dictionary...

260
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:49,636
Excuse me, one Compact
Oxford English Dictionary, please.

261
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,556
Dad, no. It costs a fortune.

262
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,559
You need something
to remember this visit by.

263
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:59,521
- Here you go.
- Holy mother!

264
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:01,940
This is the monolith from 2001.

265
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:04,859
It has every word ever recorded
in the English language...

266
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:07,070
plus origins and earliest usage.

267
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:10,573
Wouldn't you rather have a car?
They weigh about the same. Here.

268
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:12,284
This is so nice of you.

269
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,329
Yeah, I've got a lot of things
to make up for.

270
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:17,663
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

271
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,919
I'm sorry, but your card's been rejected.

272
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:26,756
- Rejected? What are you talking about?
- I can run it through again if you like.

273
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,841
- Yes.
- No.

274
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:32,553
He doesn't need to run it through again.

275
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:36,891
Could you hold that for us?
I'll come back with another card.

276
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:39,852
- Sure, Chris. No problem.
- Thanks. Come on.

277
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:51,072
- Now you'll really remember me.
- I didn't want it that much anyway.

278
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,910
Listen, don't tell your mom
about this, okay?

279
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:58,495
- Okay.
- Thanks.

280
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:02,082
Yes, it is her real dad. He seems very nice.

281
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:05,335
Kind of a folkie, poppy,
urban, scruffy look to him.

282
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,379
Obviously there's
some money mixed in there...

283
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:10,299
because he's got that, you know,
money nose.

284
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,985
- Rory was at the game today.
- Yeah.

285
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:33,237
- She was with some guy.
- Dean.

286
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,823
No, I know that punk. Some older guy.

287
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:39,660
- That would've been her dad.
- Really? So that's...

288
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:43,080
The guy who impregnated me
with Rory, yes.

289
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:45,248
He did a good job.

290
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:49,170
- Impregnating me with Rory?
- This has taken a very weird turn.

291
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:55,133
Hi, where were you?

292
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:57,469
We saw Al's Paraguayan Pancake House.

293
00:15:57,511 --> 00:16:01,097
We were stalked by townspeople,
and apparently, I look like Billy Crudup.

294
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:03,766
- You do not.
- Take it up with Jackson.

295
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:11,065
Hello?

296
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:13,484
Emily!

297
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:16,529
- It's your mother.
- Hi, Grandma.

298
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:22,452
Actually, I'm sitting here with your girls.

299
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:25,663
Sure. She wants to speak to you.

300
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:27,456
Hi, Mom.

301
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,917
Lorelai, Christopher is in town.

302
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:31,794
What? I didn't know.

303
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:35,798
Coincidentally, I'm sitting across
from an amazing Christopher hologram.

304
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,967
I just had this wonderful idea.

305
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,843
Christopher's parents are in town, too.

306
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,846
You remember Straub and Francine,
don't you?

307
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:43,847
Yes, the Schnickelfritzes.

308
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:45,599
- The who?
- The Haydens.

309
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,059
I called them up
and invited them to dinner.

310
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:51,646
They said that they are free
to join us all on Friday night.

311
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:53,607
- Join us all?
- Yes.

312
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:56,068
You, Rory, Christopher, your father.

313
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:59,070
- That's quite a gathering, Mom.
- I should say so.

314
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:01,614
We haven't been together
since you both were children.

315
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:04,659
Straub and Francine haven't seen Rory
since she was a baby.

316
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,954
- Yeah, I know, but...
- It'll be like a wonderful reunion.

317
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:11,082
All of us together again.
I never thought it would happen.

318
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,126
Yeah. Me either.

319
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,975
I've gotta see my parents.

320
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,186
Ladies and gentlemen,
the drama king and queen of Connecticut.

321
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:43,488
Hello, anybody home?

322
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,532
Oh, my God, you're here.

323
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,700
Christopher, look at you.

324
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,870
Emily, as always, perfect.

325
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:52,497
I am so glad to see you.
I didn't hear the doorbell.

326
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,666
We didn't ring the doorbell.

327
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,919
- You let yourselves in?
- It's okay. Look, not a rapist among us.

328
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,045
Hi, Grandma.

329
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,631
- You usually knock.
- Not since you gave us a key.

330
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:05,510
- That's for emergencies.
- Mom, I'm starving to death.

331
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:08,263
Is that enough of an emergency for you?

332
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:12,016
Richard's in the living room.
Come on in. He's dying to see you.

333
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:16,271
It's a setup, giving me that key. It's meant
to be used. It's my parents' house.

334
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:17,688
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

335
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:18,982
Here they are!

336
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,941
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hello, Rory.

337
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:23,444
Lorelai. Christopher, old boy, how are you?

338
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:24,987
My gosh, it's good to see you.

339
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,114
- How are you, Richard?
- Better than most.

340
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:29,742
- Not as good as some.
- And annoyed with all.

341
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:31,661
You speak the truth, young man.

342
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,829
I have made martinis.

343
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:36,874
So, Christopher,
tell me about your business.

344
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,668
Richard, let the poor boy relax.

345
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,421
I simply want to find out how it's going.

346
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:43,797
It's going great.

347
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:46,591
I'm afraid to jinx it
by telling you how good it's going.

348
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:49,511
That is wonderful.
I always knew you had it in you.

349
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,180
You have a splash of greatness,
as my mother would say.

350
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,974
You always had that splash of greatness.

351
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:58,478
I'd like another splash of greatness
if you don't mind.

352
00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:01,481
Richard, isn't Rory
the spitting image of Christopher?

353
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:04,943
I just hope you inherit
your father's business sense also, dear.

354
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:06,111
I know one thing for sure.

355
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:08,988
You certainly have
your father's musical talent.

356
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:12,157
- Wait just a minute.
- What?

357
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:14,619
Neither of these two
have any musical talent.

358
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:17,330
- I play guitar.
- The opening lick to Smoke On The Water.

359
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:19,957
And I've mastered the opening lick
to Jumpin' Jack Flash.

360
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,251
I'm a Chuck Berry man myself.

361
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,296
Something wrong?

362
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:28,965
I'd never have guessed that last sentence
would ever come out of your mouth.

363
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,843
- And why not?
- Chuck Berry?

364
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:34,179
Yes, Chuck Berry. He was all the rage
when I was in school.

365
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:38,350
- So we're talking pre My Ding-A-Ling?
- I believe I am.

366
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:41,019
Do you remember
when the two of you were ten...

367
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:43,646
and you put on that adorable show for us?

368
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:44,815
What show, Mom?

369
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:47,276
Lucy, Schroeder,
you laying on the coffee table.

370
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,570
You pretending it was a piano.
God, why is that remembered?

371
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:53,031
Because it was
such a wonderful production.

372
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:56,159
I don't know if it was a production.
It was just one song.

373
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:58,536
- Suppertime.
- Did you write that?

374
00:19:58,578 --> 00:19:59,912
That was really very good.

375
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:03,499
Dad, that's from You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown. It's a famous musical.

376
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,626
I thought Christopher
might have written it.

377
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,670
He's a very talented man.

378
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:11,006
That would be Straub and Francine.

379
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:12,883
Your turn.

380
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:15,428
Haven't seen your parents
in quite a number of years.

381
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:18,096
We were practically inseparable
for a while.

382
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,807
I remember that.

383
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:21,976
This is weird.

384
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:24,686
These are my other grandparents.
I don't even know them.

385
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,856
- What do I call them?
- Call them what I call them.

386
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:29,900
Sorry, my tie's too tight.

387
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,444
Just call them Straub and Francine.

388
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:35,196
Call them Mr. And Mrs. Hayden.

389
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:38,492
Sir and ma'am?
Just avoid calling them anything.

390
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,159
Look who's here.

391
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:44,039
- Hello, Mother, Pop.
- Christopher.

392
00:20:44,081 --> 00:20:45,707
Christopher, hello.

393
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,626
Mr. And Mrs. Hayden, long time no see.

394
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:51,921
- Lorelai, you look well.
- I am, thanks.

395
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,507
You remember Rory.
You haven't seen her in a while.

396
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:55,675
No, we haven't.

397
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,219
She was just beginning to speak
in complete sentences.

398
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:00,346
So not for two years then.

399
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:04,058
She's been talking a long time.

400
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,228
I was making a humorous comment
sometimes referred to as a joke.

401
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:10,314
- I see you haven't changed, Lorelai.
- No, not at all.

402
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:12,691
- Rory, hello.
- Hi.

403
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:17,947
- Did you just curtsy?
- Shut up.

404
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,156
Sorry, milady.

405
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,785
- Straub, Francine, how about a martini?
- Please.

406
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:27,247
How is retirement treating you?

407
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:29,374
Yes, do tell us about the Bahamas.

408
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,836
You can get an entire island there
for the cost of a decent house here.

409
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,046
Really?

410
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:37,048
How about you?
Any thoughts of retirement on your mind?

411
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:40,760
Straub, if only you could talk him into it.
I've given up.

412
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:45,265
We're very pleased about Christopher's
business success out in California.

413
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:49,394
Yes, it's taken a while, but it seems
to be finally coming together.

414
00:21:49,478 --> 00:21:52,397
- Seems to be.
- Christopher, your tie, please.

415
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:55,316
Straub and...

416
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:57,777
Mr. And Mrs...

417
00:21:58,194 --> 00:22:01,572
Are you enjoying your time here...

418
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:03,449
you two?

419
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,867
That she got from you.

420
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:07,370
- How old are you, young lady?
- 16.

421
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:09,162
A dangerous age for girls.

422
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,542
Rory is a very special child.
Excellent student, very bright.

423
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:17,254
You should have a talk with her.
She could give you a run for your money.

424
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,339
- Is that so?
- That's right.

425
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,016
I think my money is safe.

426
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,143
- I hate President Bush.
- What?

427
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,187
- Oh, boy.
- He's stupid.

428
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:37,315
His face is too tiny for his head.
I just wanna toss him out.

429
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,026
- That is the leader of our country.
- Ignore her.

430
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:43,529
'His face is too tiny for his head,'
what kind of a thing is that to say?

431
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,073
I see your daughter's
just as out of control as ever.

432
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,200
Pop, please. Let's try to keep it civil.

433
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,745
What have you been doing
with your life, anyway...

434
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,831
besides hating successful businessmen?
I'm just curious.

435
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,708
Why don't we go to the dining room?

436
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,086
I run an inn near Stars Hollow.

437
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,379
- Really?
- Yes, really.

438
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,756
- Dad, come on.
- Nice to see you found your calling.

439
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Dinner's ready.

440
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,509
- Christopher, your tie.
- Mom, please.

441
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,345
- Is your life all you hoped it would be?
- Yes, it is.

442
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,306
You might not want to take
quite such a haughty tone...

443
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,100
when you announce to the world
that you work in a hotel.

444
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,936
There's nothing wrong with where I work.

445
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,563
Please, I'm getting a headache.

446
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,190
Come on, Richard,
lead us into the dining room now.

447
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,608
If you'd attended university...

448
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,945
as your parents had planned,
and as we had in vain for Christopher...

449
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,781
you might have aspired
to more than a blue-collar position.

450
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,200
- Don't do this.
- I wouldn't give a damn about you...

451
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,952
derailing your own life
if you hadn't swept my son along.

452
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,246
Honey, go in the next room. Go, go.

453
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,708
I'm going to have to echo
Christopher's call for civility here.

454
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,878
A mutual mistake was made
many years ago by these two.

455
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,671
But they've come a long way since.

456
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,591
A mutual mistake?
This whole evening is ridiculous.

457
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,094
We're supposed to sit here
like one big family...

458
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,596
and pretend the damage
that was done is over?

459
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,640
I don't care about how good
a student you say that girl is.

460
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,101
Our son was bound for Princeton.

461
00:23:57,143 --> 00:23:59,937
Every Hayden male attended Princeton,
including myself.

462
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:02,064
But it all stopped with Christopher.

463
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:04,316
It's a humiliation we've had to live with...

464
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,611
all because you seduced him
into ruining his life.

465
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:09,780
She had that baby and ended his future.

466
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,824
- You recant that.
- You're spilling my drink.

467
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:14,617
- You owe my daughter an apology.
- An apology? That is rich.

468
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:16,870
- How dare you?
- Richard, what are you doing?

469
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,414
- How dare you insult my daughter!
- Let go of me!

470
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,958
What is going on here?

471
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:24,335
- Shame on you for opening all this again.
- Get your purse, Francine.

472
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,504
My daughter's very successful
at what she does.

473
00:24:26,588 --> 00:24:29,841
- We're leaving.
- You're not leaving, I'm kicking you out!

474
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:32,469
Come on.

475
00:24:40,393 --> 00:24:42,895
And you brought up Bush because...

476
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:45,773
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

477
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:50,486
I feel 16.

478
00:24:58,953 --> 00:25:00,037
Dad.

479
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,543
Can I get you something to eat?

480
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:09,171
- I'm not hungry.
- Okay.

481
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:13,633
Look, thank you.

482
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,261
Thank me? For what?

483
00:25:17,137 --> 00:25:19,180
For what you did in there.

484
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:23,059
I'm just unbelievably touched
and grateful for what you said to him...

485
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:25,019
for defending me like that.

486
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:27,730
I know it was hard for you because...

487
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:30,274
But thank you.

488
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:33,569
Why do you think I did it?

489
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:36,072
- What?
- Why do you think I did it?

490
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:39,826
I don't know.
Out of protectiveness, I guess.

491
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:43,371
You don't need to be protected, Lorelai.

492
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:46,249
You've made it very clear
that you can look after yourself...

493
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:49,418
- and that you need nothing from anyone.
- That's not...

494
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:52,212
A member of my family
was being attacked.

495
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,298
The very Gilmore name
was being attacked.

496
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:57,343
I will not stand for that,
not under any circumstances.

497
00:25:57,426 --> 00:26:00,303
Okay, it doesn't really matter
why you did it.

498
00:26:00,388 --> 00:26:03,724
Yes, it does matter why I did it.
It matters greatly!

499
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:05,725
What are you going to take away
from this?

500
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:10,063
That everything that happened in the past
is suddenly fine because I defended you?

501
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:12,398
That the hell
you put your mother and me through...

502
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:14,901
for the past 16 years
is suddenly washed away?

503
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:17,236
- It's not!
- We've all been through hell.

504
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:19,865
I had to tell my friends, my colleagues...

505
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:23,076
that my only daughter,
the brightest in her class...

506
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,036
was pregnant and was leaving school.

507
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:26,621
That must have been devastating.

508
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:29,457
Then you run away and treat us as lepers.

509
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:33,043
Your mother couldn't get out of bed
for a month. Did you know that?

510
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:36,923
We did nothing to deserve that.
Nothing to earn that.

511
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:38,758
I get it, I'm horrible.

512
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,470
So why don't you disown me
and adopt Christopher? You love him.

513
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:45,430
Don't be a martyr, Lorelai.
And don't be naive.

514
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:48,434
Do you think I love the boy
who got my daughter pregnant?

515
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:51,812
I wanted to kill him.
I would have, too, with my bare hands.

516
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:55,482
But there was a proper procedure
to be followed in a situation like this.

517
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:56,650
Marriage.

518
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:59,611
Christopher was willing to follow
the procedure we laid out.

519
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:02,447
- You weren't.
- What about what I wanted?

520
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:05,200
Dad, didn't that matter to you at all?

521
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:06,785
Sometimes...

522
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,373
one has to sacrifice something
in order to do what is right.

523
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,544
I feel indescribably sad
for you right now, Dad.

524
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:21,049
Save your emotions.
I've had my fill of them tonight.

525
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:24,177
So we just end it here?

526
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,137
Nothing resolved?

527
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:31,809
I'm tired.

528
00:27:34,604 --> 00:27:35,688
Okay.

529
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:44,989
There you are.
I was wondering where you went.

530
00:27:45,072 --> 00:27:47,991
- Sorry.
- No, it's nothing to be sorry about.

531
00:27:48,284 --> 00:27:50,786
- Can I get you something?
- I'm fine.

532
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,413
That's hardly dinner.

533
00:27:55,332 --> 00:27:57,959
That was quite a bit of excitement tonight.

534
00:27:58,002 --> 00:27:59,211
Oh, yeah.

535
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:01,462
- Not the good kind.
- Nope.

536
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:05,508
- None of this means anything, Rory.
- I know.

537
00:28:06,426 --> 00:28:09,387
Straub is actually a good man, very smart.

538
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:12,932
He was one of the top lawyers in his field.

539
00:28:13,016 --> 00:28:16,102
A very arcane aspect of international law.

540
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:19,814
And he's always been so active
in his community.

541
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:23,234
His charity work
has never diminished over the years.

542
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:27,405
Let's face it, he's a big ass.

543
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:34,327
I know you heard a lot of talk
on various disappointments this evening.

544
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,206
I know you've heard a lot of talk
about it in the past.

545
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,709
But I wanna make this very clear.
You, young lady...

546
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:44,796
your person and your existence have never
ever been, not even for a second...

547
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,715
included in that list.

548
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,928
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, I do.

549
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:53,930
Good. Now eat up.

550
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:08,445
You look great.

551
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:11,906
Yeah, I look the way I feel, wise guy.

552
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:21,207
- That was a memorable evening.
- Yes, it was beautiful in there.

553
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:25,002
We should commemorate it
with an oil painting...

554
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:27,088
or a severed head or something.

555
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,967
Next time we get this group together,
we're gonna have to frisk for weapons.

556
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,970
- Hand out gags.
- Employ six individual cones of silence.

557
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:42,769
The old balcony's still the same, isn't it?

558
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:45,605
In all its beautiful away-from-them-ness.

559
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:48,108
Perfect hideout, totally private.

560
00:29:49,193 --> 00:29:51,528
We spent a lot of time out here.

561
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:55,031
Sneaking Dad's telescope,
scanning the skies for alien ships.

562
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:56,699
Never found any.

563
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:00,996
Then when we were older, scanning
the neighbors' houses for naked people.

564
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:04,582
- Found a couple of those.
- Mrs. Dominski...

565
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:10,213
undulating in her big, fat underalls
is forever carved into my brain.

566
00:30:10,297 --> 00:30:14,467
And in mine.
Here's to Mrs. Dominski's underalls.

567
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:17,887
Holding out on me.

568
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:20,848
Take it.

569
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:26,270
And in an effort to further chronicle
this balcony's history...

570
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:28,731
we are now in the immediate vicinity...

571
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:32,108
of the spot upon which
was Rory's initial emanation.

572
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:36,155
Yes, we are. Here's to Rory.

573
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:40,825
- The bright spot in all the darkness.
- And how.

574
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:49,083
Even if you hadn't gotten pregnant
and everything had gone as planned...

575
00:30:49,168 --> 00:30:51,753
I still would've never made it
through Princeton.

576
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:53,630
I don't believe that.

577
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:57,467
That's why you're you and I'm not.

578
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:43,011
Wow.

579
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:47,015
- You wigged?
- Yeah, I'm a little wigged.

580
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:48,766
- Why?
- Are you kidding me?

581
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,687
This is the next-to-last thing
I thought would happen tonight.

582
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:56,357
The last thing being a saint
riding down on a chariot from Heaven...

583
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:57,525
to announce Armageddon.

584
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:01,195
Hartford's the place he chooses to make
his announcement? I don't think so.

585
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:03,822
Yes, it was unexpected, but it was great.

586
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:07,702
- God, I can't believe this.
- Fine. You know what? We should go.

587
00:32:07,744 --> 00:32:10,413
Yeah, we should go, like, 30 minutes ago.

588
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,373
I'm sorry.

589
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:16,085
Don't apologize. It was the both of us.

590
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:23,676
God, my parents have got to seal
these windows up, I swear to God.

591
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:29,306
- So, where were you guys?
- Nowhere.

592
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,725
- Where's nowhere?
- Where we were.

593
00:32:40,651 --> 00:32:43,111
- Good night, you.
- Good night, Dad.

594
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:48,574
- Good night, Lor.
- Good night, yeah...

595
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,286
You have a really good night.

596
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:58,626
You've got some dirt
or some schmutz on your...

597
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,586
- Where did you...
- It's been a long night.

598
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:03,505
There's just been a lot
of schmutzing going on.

599
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,925
Come on, we haven't really had
a chance to talk.

600
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:07,968
- About the schmutzing?
- No.

601
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:11,097
About all the warm and fuzzy
family moments that went on tonight.

602
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,265
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

603
00:33:13,307 --> 00:33:17,519
All those crazy people saying horrible
things were directing them at me, not you.

604
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:19,938
They were directing them to you
because you had me.

605
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,690
No, they were directing them at me
because I screwed up...

606
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:25,611
their big Citizen Kane plans, that's all.

607
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:28,655
- They don't even wanna know me.
- That is not true.

608
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:31,408
They are just so full of anger
and stupid pride...

609
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:35,662
that stands in the way of them realizing
how much they wanna know you.

610
00:33:35,704 --> 00:33:36,788
Yeah.

611
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,582
Their loss, and it's a pretty big one.

612
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,459
I'm going to bed now.

613
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,464
No regrets from me or your dad.

614
00:33:46,673 --> 00:33:49,509
- Yeah?
- No regrets about you.

615
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:53,763
There's a misspelled-tattoo incident that
I'm sure he'd like to erase from his bio.

616
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:55,390
But you, that's a no-brainer.

617
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:57,641
Where does dad have a misspelled tattoo?

618
00:33:57,684 --> 00:34:01,604
Another story for another time,
possibly before your first trip to Mazatlan.

619
00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:04,148
- Good night, babe.
- Good night, Mom.

620
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:24,918
Oh, no.

621
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,596
- I feel horrible.
- Don't.

622
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,848
- I stood you up. I didn't even call.
- It's okay.

623
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:42,894
- I'm a rat. We had a date. I stood you up.
- It wasn't a date. It was just to paint.

624
00:34:42,936 --> 00:34:44,771
- I'm a rat. I need cheese.
- Forget it.

625
00:34:44,854 --> 00:34:47,606
- Let's reschedule.
- I didn't wanna do it in the first place.

626
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:51,861
Come on, don't change your mind.
We can do it tonight or right now.

627
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:54,697
- Was it an emergency?
- Yes.

628
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,784
You would not believe what happened.
I slipped, and I busted my...

629
00:34:59,452 --> 00:35:01,412
It wasn't an emergency.

630
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:03,956
It was just me being a rat.

631
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,749
- Something came up?
- Yeah.

632
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:07,792
Something, someone.

633
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:11,588
- Am I right?
- I'm sorry.

634
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:16,218
Yeah, okay. Well, I'm late.

635
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:28,730
Where were you?

636
00:35:28,772 --> 00:35:31,858
Fruitlessly trying to rectify
a ratty transgression.

637
00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:33,943
- You want some coffee?
- No.

638
00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:35,361
What?

639
00:35:35,612 --> 00:35:38,698
I know you well enough to know
that when you say no to coffee...

640
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:41,659
- all is not right in Whoville.
- Very astute.

641
00:35:41,785 --> 00:35:43,453
So, last night...

642
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,664
Last night was Chernobyl
and the Hindenburg combined.

643
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:49,625
- Right, just checking.
- My father almost hit someone.

644
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:52,878
He's probably only hit someone
in college wearing boxing gloves...

645
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:55,798
and one of those Fred Mertz,
Golden Gloves pullover sweaters.

646
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,508
- Fred Mertz?
- I Love Lucy, Fred Mertz.

647
00:35:57,592 --> 00:36:00,386
Landlord to Ricky, husband to Ethel.
It's a weird reference.

648
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:02,596
- Hello, pajamas.
- Right, continue.

649
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,724
- My dad had a meltdown with your dad...
- He was asking for it.

650
00:36:05,808 --> 00:36:09,436
...and then with me.
And then, you and me.

651
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:11,647
- Oh, boy.
- Don't say it like that.

652
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:13,649
- Stupid. Dumb.
- Much better.

653
00:36:13,732 --> 00:36:16,860
And to top off the whole fabulous fiasco...

654
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:19,363
I stood up a friend
who was counting on me.

655
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:22,740
He just stood there looking hurt
with the paint and the chairs.

656
00:36:22,824 --> 00:36:24,784
And it hurt me. It's not your fault.

657
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:27,203
But in this parade of stupid and dumb...

658
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,997
I am the one twirling the flaming baton.

659
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:31,333
- Lor?
- What?

660
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,167
I wanna marry you.

661
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:37,713
And the hits just keep on coming.

662
00:36:37,797 --> 00:36:39,673
Just think about it
before you make a rash...

663
00:36:39,758 --> 00:36:43,386
You are completely insane.
You have flipped your lid!

664
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,847
Charlie Manson is freaked out
by you right now!

665
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:48,349
- Come on, we're already a family.
- Who's a family?

666
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:49,683
Us. You, me, and Rory.

667
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:52,603
- You don't know what a family is.
- People living together.

668
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:56,565
No, it's a big commitment.
It's responsibility and hard work.

669
00:36:56,649 --> 00:37:00,152
It's coming home at the same time
to the same place every day.

670
00:37:00,236 --> 00:37:02,112
What do you want, financial statements?

671
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:04,531
I can be a family man.
I'm responsible now.

672
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:09,077
Honey, you can't even buy a book
without having your credit card declined.

673
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:12,121
I told Rory not to rat me out.
I can't believe she did that.

674
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:13,332
She didn't.

675
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:16,376
Andrew from the bookstore called,
and Jackson, and the UPS guy.

676
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:18,795
It was the lead story
on the Stars Hollow web page.

677
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:21,673
Then I asked Rory,
and she very reluctantly confirmed it.

678
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:24,467
- 'Rat me out. ' What are you, 16?
- I'm sorry.

679
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:27,345
What are you doing telling my daughter
to lie to me, anyway?

680
00:37:27,387 --> 00:37:29,847
- She's my daughter, too.
- More like your playmate.

681
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,267
I don't deserve that. I'm as mature as you.

682
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,895
What? The Offspring is your favorite band.

683
00:37:35,979 --> 00:37:37,897
So? You're into Metallica.

684
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:40,524
Metallica is way more substantial
than The Offspring.

685
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:43,194
It's the same Black Sabbath riff
all over again.

686
00:37:43,236 --> 00:37:46,614
The Offspring have one chord progression.
They use it over and over.

687
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,782
They pop on new words
and call it a single.

688
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,534
I don't wanna talk about this anymore!

689
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:52,911
I'm the immature and irresponsible one.

690
00:37:52,995 --> 00:37:55,247
I was willing to get married
when you got pregnant.

691
00:37:55,331 --> 00:37:58,083
We were too young
and wouldn't have made it. You know that.

692
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:00,127
We're not too young now.

693
00:38:00,586 --> 00:38:02,796
Okay, now I need some coffee.

694
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:10,845
What about last night?
What did our having sex mean to you?

695
00:38:11,096 --> 00:38:14,557
It meant that Jose Cuervo
still has amazing magical powers.

696
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,101
You're funny.

697
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:24,067
We can't get married, Christopher.
We don't even know each other as adults.

698
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:26,903
Let's get married
and get to know each other as adults.

699
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:29,572
That's very Fiddler on the Roof of you.

700
00:38:29,614 --> 00:38:32,450
Let's get to know each other.
What do you wanna know?

701
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:34,911
How's your business really doing?

702
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:42,501
I knew it.

703
00:38:42,794 --> 00:38:46,380
I was gonna tell you
if it didn't pick up soon. I swear.

704
00:38:46,464 --> 00:38:49,300
You just sat there last night,
just smiling and nodding...

705
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:51,552
while my dad and your dad
went on and on...

706
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:54,971
about Christopher and his
great big business success in California.

707
00:38:55,014 --> 00:38:56,557
I didn't wanna upset anybody.

708
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,641
- I wanted last night to be nice.
- It was.

709
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:00,853
It would've been better
if I would've announced:

710
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:03,438
'On top of everything you're upset about,
I wanna add...

711
00:39:03,522 --> 00:39:05,982
'I'm the world's biggest loser. '
Would that be festive?

712
00:39:06,066 --> 00:39:08,151
- You're not a loser.
- Please.

713
00:39:08,235 --> 00:39:10,278
You're a liar, but you're not a loser.

714
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,447
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

715
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,368
We're arguing like an old married couple.
Doesn't that show potential?

716
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:18,744
Christopher, I swear to God...

717
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:24,375
I've been looking for the one.
That elusive soul mate. I really have.

718
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:27,003
I just believe it's you. It's always been you.

719
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:30,256
- Chris, come on.
- Rory might be my only child.

720
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,093
That's not true. If Tony Randall
can crank one out in his 70s...

721
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:36,470
you have decades left to spawn.

722
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:40,641
I don't know how much I miss Rory
until I see her like this.

723
00:39:42,018 --> 00:39:43,853
It's easier staying away.

724
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:46,813
No, don't stay away.

725
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:49,650
Don't.

726
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:53,695
Rory needs her dad.

727
00:39:56,156 --> 00:39:57,824
Or her pal, right?

728
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:01,661
I think she'd take a combo.

729
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,961
- Call us when you get home.
- I will.

730
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:13,047
- And call more.
- I will.

731
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:19,053
See you.

732
00:40:23,266 --> 00:40:25,851
Dad wants to know if you'll reconsider.

733
00:40:34,443 --> 00:40:37,904
She says, 'Nope, Offspring sucks
and Metallica rules. '

734
00:40:39,615 --> 00:40:41,033
Fair enough.

735
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,539
Drive safe.

736
00:40:59,134 --> 00:41:02,428
- He wanted you to marry him, didn't he?
- Spy.

737
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:04,764
You know, crazier things have happened.

738
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:06,766
Crazier than having
your mom and dad married?

739
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,434
- Yes.
- I don't think they have.

740
00:41:08,518 --> 00:41:10,519
- Why is that so crazy?
- Because it is.

741
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:13,982
Because he wants things
he is not ready for.

742
00:41:14,149 --> 00:41:18,027
- How do you know?
- I know him so well, you have no idea.

743
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:20,863
Maybe he can change. Maybe it's different.

744
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:23,908
He did come here this time.
He's never done that before.

745
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,284
- Stop.
- Why?

746
00:41:25,368 --> 00:41:27,787
I don't want you
getting all worked up over this.

747
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:29,580
- He loves you.
- He does love me.

748
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:31,582
- Do you love him?
- Honey, come on.

749
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:32,958
Answer me.

750
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,668
- Honestly?
- Yes.

751
00:41:35,086 --> 00:41:37,963
- I will probably always love him.
- Okay, so?

752
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,589
But that doesn't change the fact...

753
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:43,844
that he still has a long way to go
before he is ready to take us on full time.

754
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:45,804
I mean, you are a handful, missy.

755
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:48,390
While I'm pure joy and sunshine
every waking hour...

756
00:41:48,474 --> 00:41:51,643
I still have my own set of needs
that must be met.

757
00:41:52,186 --> 00:41:55,772
It just wasn't right, babe.
You have to trust me on that.

758
00:42:01,153 --> 00:42:02,612
Talk, please.

759
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,116
I still think
there was a little something different.

760
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,284
- Maybe you're right.
- Really?

761
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:11,328
- It would be nice.
- Yeah, it would.

762
00:42:12,205 --> 00:42:15,875
I'll tell you what,
let's not put all the blankets away just yet.

763
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:18,294
- Really?
- You never know.

764
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:37,354
What the...

765
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:42,233
- How'd you get in here?
- Your bread guy let me in.

766
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:44,153
I'm switching bread guys.

767
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,030
- What do you think?
- I think you shouldn't break and enter.

768
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:48,740
So what do you think?

769
00:42:48,824 --> 00:42:51,826
I've got to admit it looks pretty good.

770
00:42:52,577 --> 00:42:54,912
- I knew you'd like it.
- Thanks.

771
00:42:54,996 --> 00:42:57,164
Anytime. It's fun.

772
00:43:00,293 --> 00:43:02,044
So, where's the guy?

773
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:05,256
- He's gone.
- Too bad.

774
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:07,258
We'll be fine.

775
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:11,178
- Luke?
- Yeah?

776
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,306
- Can I make one more suggestion?
- Nope.

777
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,891
- Curtains.
- No.

778
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,227
- Manly curtains.
- Oxymoron.

779
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:20,020
- What did you call me?
- No curtains.

780
00:43:20,062 --> 00:43:21,313
Come on!

781
00:43:21,397 --> 00:43:23,857
You got to give a little.
How about a tablecloth?

782
00:43:23,899 --> 00:43:26,151
No, we don't do tablecloths here.
