1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,338
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,840
Dad!

3
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:12,137
- I want to marry you.
- You're completely insane!

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:13,222
- Who is he?
- Who?

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,307
The boy you ran off to see,
who calls here...

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,643
pretending to work for
The Wall Street Journal.

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,062
I can be a family man.
I'm responsible now.

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,607
Honey, you can't even buy a book
without having your credit card declined.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,484
- Maybe he can change.
- Rory.

10
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,904
Maybe it's different. He did come here
this time. He's never done that.

11
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,657
No boys. Not unless I approve,
and I don't approve.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,741
- How do you know?
- I know!

13
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,869
You're sneaking, you're lying.
Something's wrong with this boy.

14
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,830
- A Volvo sedan? Are you kidding?
- This is a great car.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,583
- For driving to bingo.
- It just seemed like time.

16
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,752
I couldn't keep showing up
for work on my bike.

17
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,295
- Work?
- You've heard of it?

18
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,548
- You go upstairs and calm down!
- Fine!

19
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,258
- Now!
- Fine!

20
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,427
That is not calming down!

21
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,057
I really have to get back.

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,600
- To work?
- To someone.

23
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,644
Linda from marketing
got to you, didn't she?

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,728
Her name is Sherrie.

25
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,523
- Is it serious?
- We're living together.

26
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,696
My question is, how did that happen?
How was it that suddenly...

27
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,408
everyone was saying, 'music has charms
to sooth the savage beast'...

28
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,451
- when it was written 'breast'?
- I don't know.

29
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:20,080
- Someone misspoke and it just caught on.
- How do things like that catch on?

30
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,125
- Please, you're driving me crazy.
- Did some guy say it...

31
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,503
at a big rally of some sort
and everyone started saying it that way...

32
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,714
- and it spread from there?
- Yes, exactly.

33
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,383
Now you're just trying to shut me up.

34
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,468
- Oh, my God.
- What?

35
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,678
Look.

36
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,138
Empty.

37
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,433
Just one of those weird lulls.
Happens occasionally.

38
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,977
- Can we sit wherever we like?
- Wherever you like.

39
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,771
- Luxury I never dreamed of.
- Where do you want to sit?

40
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,898
I don't know.

41
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,775
How about this table
with its unobstructed westward view...

42
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,111
of the wide cosmopolitan expanse
of Clump Street?

43
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,155
Tempting. Do you know
that on a clear day...

44
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,074
you can see the garbage cans
behind Al's Pancake World?

45
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,410
Or we could sit in the corner,
the mafia table...

46
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,622
so that no one can come up behind you
and whack you with a cannoli.

47
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,083
Whack you with a cannoli? Because he left
the gun and took the cannoli.

48
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,127
You are so my daughter.

49
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,671
Let's sit at the counter.

50
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,632
No, those are not the power seats.

51
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:15,177
But with no one here, we can sit
at either end and play bagel hockey.

52
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,430
- Bagel hockey.
- Just sit at a table.

53
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,351
You're awfully rude for a guy
who only has two paying customers.

54
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,104
Okay, 3:30 on Friday:
My debate at Chilton, write it down.

55
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,814
- Already written.
- Good.

56
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,776
- You prepared?
- Please. Paris has us beyond prepared.

57
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,570
I know more about
doctor-assisted suicide than I care to.

58
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,947
Cheery topic.

59
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,989
Luke's.

60
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,284
Hold on a second. It's for you.

61
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,412
- What?
- But who knows we're here?

62
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,541
- This morning has been Twilight Zone-y.
- Or Outer Limits-y.

63
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,252
- What?
- Great show, just as eerie, same era...

64
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,962
but no one ever references it.

65
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,215
- I'm sorry, I don't speak geek.
- Yep, stepped right in it.

66
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,675
- Hello?
- Rory?

67
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,718
Lane? How did you know I was here?

68
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:01,223
Telescope. I've got a clean shot at Luke's.
I saw you and your mom go in.

69
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,308
- Watch it.
- Yeah, duck, Harvey.

70
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,936
Are you still grounded over
that whole Henry thing?

71
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,146
Are you kidding?
The mother of all groundings.

72
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,149
Mom's done everything
but slap a Dr. Dre ankle bracelet on me.

73
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,944
- I'm not even going to school.
- Isn't that illegal?

74
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,155
She talked my teachers into me
being home-schooled for two weeks.

75
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,283
The words 'highly contagious'
were bandied about.

76
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,451
I get five minutes a day
of outside phone time.

77
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,453
Unlimited time
to call the Psalm-A-Day Line.

78
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,748
A big rip-off because Psalm 79
has been on there for three days.

79
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,209
That's not in keeping with
what their name implies...

80
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,919
which is a new Psalm every day...

81
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,046
not the same tired one
from the previous days.

82
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,591
Never heard anyone get so riled up
about psalms before.

83
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,134
My world has become very small.

84
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,595
Okay, I'm dying for news.
Give me some headlines.

85
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,430
I've got a debate coming up...

86
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,016
and Dean's been working
extra hours lately...

87
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,727
saving up for a new motorcycle,
so I hardly see him.

88
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,979
Mom and I haven't done
laundry in three weeks...

89
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,899
but I've begun jumping into
the huge pile of dirty clothes...

90
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,484
as we play our Reader's Digest
World's Famous Polkas CD.

91
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,904
We got it used for 99 cents.
Sorry if that's boring.

92
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,781
You kidding? That's the most stimulation
I've got in a week.

93
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,658
Lane, come down for your snack.

94
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,744
It's tea-and-melba-toast time. Gotta go.

95
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,537
- Don't forget me in my solitude.
- Never.

96
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,622
Bye.

97
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,917
Think fast.

98
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,544
Impressive.

99
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,838
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- What?

100
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,466
- Goalie for the bagel-hockey team.
- And bump Schmitty?

101
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,010
Schmitty's over the hill.
Put him in Cooperstown.

102
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,220
Suit up, kid.

103
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,847
Call me if anyone sane walks in.

104
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,284
- There's nothing on.
- There's always something on.

105
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,619
Struck gold.

106
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,123
- Not the two fat ladies again.
- Why not? They're brilliant.

107
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,001
- It's a cooking show and you don't cook.
- That might change.

108
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,335
- Not a chance.
- Probably not.

109
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,963
We've seen all of them five times.
They're all repeats.

110
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,549
Sadly, because one of the fat ladies
met her maker.

111
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,010
- Really? Which one?
- The fat one.

112
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,597
Come on. The one on the motorcycle
or the one in the sidecar?

113
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,516
See? It's fun just talking
about the two fat ladies.

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,311
Can't we find
other really fat people to watch?

115
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,938
That sounded really insensitive.

116
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,149
Paris.

117
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,234
- Can I come in?
- I guess.

118
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,117
You couldn't be wondering
what I'm doing here.

119
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,660
- I couldn't?
- The debate's Friday.

120
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,455
- We need more preparation.
- More preparation?

121
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,917
No two people know more
about assisted suicide than the two of us.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,752
Kevorkian called today for a few tips.

123
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,963
There's issues of presentation
that need to be addressed.

124
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,674
- Presentation?
- I was listening to the CD and cassettes...

125
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:26,678
I made of our mock debates and I realized
that you were not talking fast enough.

126
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,264
- What?
- You're only doing 135 WPM.

127
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,016
- WPM?
- 'Words per minute. '

128
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,518
- Of course.
- That's slow.

129
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,770
- That's not slow.
- It's Jimmy Bob slow.

130
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,523
- I talk normally.
- For the average Willie Nelson roadie...

131
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,024
not for a winning debate member.

132
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,444
As a comparison,
I speak an average of 178 WPM.

133
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,029
Word speed isn't everything.

134
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,699
Sometimes I will add a dramatic pause
to prove a point, undercutting my WPM.

135
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:51,620
Let's not harbor any Pinteresque fantasies.
We'll have scant minutes to argue...

136
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,789
and we have to maximize
our collective WPM.

137
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,749
Okay. Let's just get going.

138
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,837
- Paris, were we expecting you?
- You should have been.

139
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,880
I'm going to get set up.

140
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,050
I'm going to my room
to work on my WPM.

141
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,718
- Do I wanna know?
- No.

142
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,804
I'll get it!

143
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,390
- Hello?
- It's Chris.

144
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,433
- How's it going?
- Good.

145
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,603
I'm on a business trip here,
and I thought I'd check in on Rory.

146
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,606
She went to a biker party
a few days ago and never came back.

147
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,859
- Again?
- We gotta start disciplining that girl.

148
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,235
Who's got the time?

149
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:27,072
She's right here. I'll pass you to her.
Where did this business trip take you?

150
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,116
Your neck of the woods:
The Litchfield area.

151
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,409
Really? How long?

152
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,663
A couple of days, or for as long as it takes
for them to succumb to my infinite charm.

153
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,582
If you're still here on Friday...

154
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,585
you should come on down
and see Rory in a debate at Chilton.

155
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,296
- Really?
- Yeah, it starts at 3:30.

156
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,090
First come, first served.
They're expecting 20,000 people...

157
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,384
- so I'd get there early.
- Chilton up close?

158
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,803
It's your chance to see
the famous Paris in action.

159
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,890
- There might even be casualties.
- Okay, tell Rory I'll be there.

160
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,349
- Really?
- Why not?

161
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,603
- She'll be excited. Tell her yourself.
- Pass me on.

162
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,438
Dairy's bad because of the mucus.

163
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,024
You haven't had any
in the last 48 hours, have you?

164
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,817
In my cereal this morning.

165
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,779
There's a solution of salt water
and vinegar that can help cut that.

166
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,909
Girls, I'm sorry to interrupt
The Vinegar Hour, but it's your dad.

167
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,411
Dad, hi.

168
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,789
- Did you give her the cereal?
- I'd rather not say.

169
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,262
- Hello?
- It's me.

170
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,139
Lane, this is flat-out stalking.

171
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:38,143
I don't have much time. I've already
used up my five minutes of phone time...

172
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,228
but I had to talk to you.

173
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,980
There's a new Belle and Sebastian single
coming out today.

174
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,440
- I know.
- I have to have it.

175
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,442
- Okay.
- I have to have it.

176
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,945
- I don't know if I have time to pick it up.
- What?

177
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,822
Do you want to hear how I used up
my phone time today?

178
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,867
Talking to Amazon. Com,
trying to get them to overnight it...

179
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,246
in a package referencing
something Korean and religious.

180
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,748
- Wouldn't do it?
- I think they notified the government.

181
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,292
Can't you wait
for your grounding to be over?

182
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,752
I am a fanatic audiophile.

183
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,797
That comes with responsibilities
that a grounding doesn't alter.

184
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,675
I have to have this single
and you have to get it to me.

185
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,719
- Okay, I'll do my best.
- Thank you. I have to go.

186
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,392
- And you've got something in your teeth.
- Stop that.

187
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,947
There you are. Where were you?

188
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,533
I thought we would meet
by the vending machines...

189
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,577
for a little pre-debate non-dairy snack.

190
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,245
Paris wanted to do a sound check...

191
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,414
and she found problems
with the acoustics here.

192
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,167
The layout on this row of seats
is causing a bass problem.

193
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,419
We've got to move
this whole row over a foot.

194
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,879
Just move these people out.

195
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,924
Better find a seat
before she moves them all.

196
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,634
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

197
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,178
- Glad you came.
- No, you're not.

198
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,972
- What?
- I'm just getting you in the mood.

199
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,851
- Did you see Christopher anywhere?
- No.

200
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,354
What does he look like?

201
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,732
If you don't know, why are you looking?

202
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,152
I'm looking for a guy that looks like a guy
that you could be with...

203
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,905
only I'm deducting 17 years off his age
and I'm adding...

204
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,407
an all-boys private school uniform
and a Yankees cap.

205
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,409
- And does your head hurt?
- Yeah, it does.

206
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,037
If everybody could please take their seats,
we'll begin.

207
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,123
That includes all the members
of the debate teams.

208
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,920
- Brad. Hi.
- Hi, Rory.

209
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,089
- I didn't think you'd remember me.
- Of course I do.

210
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,674
- How's your new school?
- I love it.

211
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,093
It's more mellow there,
and I made a ton of friends.

212
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,221
- Good for you.
- Brad.

213
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,599
- Paris.
- Guess we're going mano a mano today.

214
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,602
- Oh, God.
- All right.

215
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:47,231
The topic for today's debate
is doctor-assisted suicide.

216
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,067
- That's pleasant.
- Let me introduce the debaters.

217
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:54,530
On the Hillside Academy team, we have
Brad Langford and Nancy Waterford.

218
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,324
- You look sick.
- I feel sick.

219
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,953
And on the Chilton team,
we have Rory Gilmore and Paris Geller.

220
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,417
- Were we not supposed to do that?
- Maybe no one noticed.

221
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,628
Teams will have three minutes
for openings...

222
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,548
three minutes for rebuttals,
and two minutes for conclusions.

223
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:16,218
They will be judged on the basis
of content, strategy, and style.

224
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,762
I will be the judge
along with Mrs. Gladstone.

225
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,556
Mrs. O'Malley is impregnable...

226
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,475
but yesterday I complimented
Mrs. Gladstone's dumpy outfit...

227
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,937
and bought her an ice-cream sandwich.
She practically licked my hand.

228
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,146
Nice going.

229
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,733
We choose which team takes
the pro or con side with the toss of a coin.

230
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,695
- A member of Hillside will make the call.
- Heads.

231
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,738
No, tails! I mean tails!

232
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,575
It's heads.

233
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,993
Chilton will pick. Pro or con?

234
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,287
- Pro assisted suicide.
- What a shock.

235
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,956
All right. Whenever you're ready,
you may commence.

236
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,167
Thank you. Keep it snappy.

237
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,799
There are many vantage points...

238
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,303
from which to consider
doctor-assisted suicide.

239
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,472
Serious consideration
draws from ethics, law...

240
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,685
medical practices, philosophy,
psychology, public policy, and religion...

241
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,022
all topics I plan to explore in the next
2 minutes and 46 seconds.

242
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,025
- Look at that kid. He's shaking.
- And pale.

243
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,277
He looks all white and tiny.

244
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,615
...either information or the actual means,
such as medication or other supplies...

245
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,951
to a person who wishes to terminate
his or her own life.

246
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:25,287
The patient must then initiate the process.

247
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,124
The goal is euthanasia,
a term with its roots in ancient Greek.

248
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,755
...and referencing their last point
which erroneously cited South Carolina...

249
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,549
as a state that has neither a statute
nor common law...

250
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,384
which prohibits assisted suicide...

251
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,513
when we know that North Carolina
is the proper citation...

252
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,058
their subsequent argument falls short
of even a level of speciousness...

253
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,394
due to the fact that it doesn't even have
a ring of factual truth...

254
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,146
let alone its substance.

255
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,108
And after all, the absence of prohibition
against assisted suicide...

256
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,529
is a far cry from a statute
which actually legitimizes the practice...

257
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,907
a state of affairs which today
exists only in Oregon, sadly enough...

258
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,493
under the 1997 Death Without Dignity Act.

259
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,745
Circus lady, what's with the contortions?

260
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,498
I'm trying to sneak a peek
at the girl Christopher's with.

261
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,584
The concept behind 'sneak'
is not having people notice you...

262
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,878
and what you're doing
is shouting, 'Notice me!'

263
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,798
- Tell me you're not curious.
- I'm not curious.

264
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,174
You are, too.

265
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,093
We'll meet her in a matter of minutes.

266
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,971
Come on, watch the tiny shaking boy
get shorter.

267
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,848
Two minutes for conclusion.

268
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,103
...concerns the increasingly
pressing nature of this debate...

269
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,981
as the baby-boomer generation
enters their graying years...

270
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:37,484
and begins to place an insupportable
burden over the nation's already...

271
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,528
You sneak a little peek?

272
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,447
Professor Bowmar of
Willamette University College of Law...

273
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,576
has prepared a summary
that I'd like to use in my remaining time.

274
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,952
- Time.
- What?

275
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,413
- Time's up.
- Lf I could have a few seconds...

276
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,790
to rebut their charge
of the cruelty of the act...

277
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,585
- We take it back.
- You can't take it back. It's a debate.

278
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,087
Okay, that's enough cruelty
for one day, Paris.

279
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,131
Your team has won. Congratulations.

280
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:02,259
Really? Thank you. Thank you very much.

281
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,018
You put up a good fight.
Better luck next time.

282
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,936
You okay?

283
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,939
I'm sweating.
I'm completely soaked through.

284
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,816
And I think I'm catching a cold.

285
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,402
Do you need a hug, or a towel?

286
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,778
No, thanks.

287
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,739
I think I'm just gonna sit here quietly.

288
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,201
- There they are.
- I see them, what do you think?

289
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,995
She's got good hair.
Plus, she's been sitting for an hour...

290
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,247
and her dress is unwrinkled.
How does she do that?

291
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,000
- She must be a witch.
- She's doing that no-hose thing.

292
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:38,003
She's a chic, good-haired, wrinkle-free,
no-hose-wearing witch.

293
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,671
- You ready?
- Yeah.

294
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,133
Hi, there, you two.

295
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,844
Hi, Lorelai. You guys get to meet at last.

296
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,304
- This is...
- Sherrie.

297
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:50,182
- Nice to meet you.
- I recognize you from your Christmas card.

298
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:53,560
- Which I'm sure you mocked.
- Did not. Others, yes, but not yours.

299
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,771
You were cute. And the puppy was cute.

300
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,940
- This is Sookie.
- Nice to meet you.

301
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,651
Nice to meet you.
You have a very smooth dress.

302
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,153
Thank you. It's the fabric.

303
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,404
The fabric.

304
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,823
- Chris, I've told you about Sookie.
- Yes, you have.

305
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,867
- The famous Sookie.
- The famous Christopher.

306
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,245
I hear you're the greatest chef
after Alain Ducasse.

307
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,705
After Alain Ducasse? Who said 'after'?

308
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,207
Hi, Dad. You came.

309
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,544
- Of course I did.
- Sorry, I'm still getting used to it.

310
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,670
I'm glad.

311
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,839
- Look who Dad brought.
- This is Sherrie.

312
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,132
- Sherrie, this is Rory.
- Finally.

313
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:28,053
I am so beyond thrilled, I can't tell you.
All he does is talk about you.

314
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,138
I couldn't wait to meet
this amazing person.

315
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,975
- She lives up to the hype.
- Is my face turning red?

316
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,226
Yeah, beet red.

317
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,813
I'm sorry. I put you on the spot.
I've just been looking forward to this.

318
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,190
- No, it's okay.
- Will you excuse us?

319
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:44,528
Rory wanted to show me something
around the corner. We'll be right back.

320
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,072
- So Rory was great.
- Brilliant.

321
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,700
So, who said I was after Alain Ducasse?

322
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,118
- He brought Sherrie.
- I know.

323
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,202
- This is a little...
- Yeah.

324
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,538
- Did you talk to her, is she nice?
- She's a witch.

325
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,081
Good.

326
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,583
- What do we do?
- What do you mean?

327
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,210
We got to put on our hostessing hats
and set a game plan.

328
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,838
It would be impolite
if we didn't ask them to hang out.

329
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,465
- Do we hit the vending machines?
- Invite them to Luke's?

330
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,801
- Does she seem like a diner chick?
- Probably not.

331
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,012
- I wish he'd said she was with him.
- Where else?

332
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:13,056
- Al's Pancake World.
- It's Friday. He does his prix-fixe menu.

333
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,350
- There's always our house.
- It's a mess.

334
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,102
- Might be the safest?
- Okay.

335
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,730
- Why didn't he say she was with him?
- I don't know.

336
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:23,650
It's more of an expression
than something I actually heard.

337
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,778
But maybe someone implied
that I was after him?

338
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,572
- Sookie.
- Yeah.

339
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,950
Know what? You are the greatest chef
in the world, bar none.

340
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,619
Thanks.

341
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,622
- Are you guys doing anything now?
- Not really.

342
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,457
We're pretty free for the day.

343
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,585
- Why don't you come and see our place?
- That would be great!

344
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,587
Sure, we'd love that. Thanks.

345
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,423
I was hoping we'd see
where Rory lives and her room.

346
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,550
- My room's no big deal.
- And the books.

347
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,345
I have heard all about the books.
I can't wait to see them.

348
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,680
Let's go and see the books.

349
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,098
Rory.

350
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,768
Great job. We pretty much
wiped the floor with them.

351
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,937
We turned them into cleaning products.

352
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,315
The verbatim transcripts of the debate
will be ready in a half-hour.

353
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,652
I thought we could wait and talk
about what we did right and wrong...

354
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,986
compare WPMs.

355
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:12,199
I'm actually heading with my group
back to our house, so I really can't.

356
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,661
Okay. Whatever.

357
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,914
If you don't want to celebrate with me,
that's just fine!

358
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,172
- You do the living room, I'll do the kitchen.
- And upstairs?

359
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:30,133
- I'll block the fool who goes upstairs!
- Company is stressful.

360
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,177
- Don't forget your room!
- What?

361
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,054
Your room! She wants to see the books.

362
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,597
I'll hit it next.

363
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,475
They're gonna want
something to eat and drink!

364
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,519
- Company usually does.
- We have nothing.

365
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,854
We must have something.

366
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,566
Only if Divine Providence has placed
a brie-and-cracker plate in the fridge.

367
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,735
- We have leftover Halloween candy.
- Waste that on company?

368
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,946
Having company
is about making sacrifices.

369
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,865
- Martha Stewart?
- I paraphrased Proust.

370
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,157
I should have known.

371
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,076
Presentation is everything.

372
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,911
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

373
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,165
- Need some more time to clean up?
- He knows us too well.

374
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,794
Come on in.
How'd you know we were cleaning?

375
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:09,006
When you cut us off in the parking lot
and sped off doing 60...

376
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,800
I figured you were trying to
beat us home for a reason.

377
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:15,846
- I hope we're not ruining your day.
- No, we love company. Please, come in.

378
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,850
- Your house is great.
- Thanks, we like it. Have a seat.

379
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,561
Rory, you were wonderful
in the debate today.

380
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,645
Thanks.

381
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,480
That Paris was a little intense.

382
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:28,400
A little? The opposing team
could bring her up on war crimes.

383
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,111
Her approach will come in handy
when she becomes a CEO...

384
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,071
or a dictator of a country or something.

385
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,408
You were very poised,
very sure of yourself, just like your dad.

386
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,744
- And your mom.
- Shucks, Pa.

387
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,622
And your uniform is darling.
I love the blue.

388
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,749
Of course, I'm sure
you look good in anything.

389
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,418
- You should see her in chaps.
- Really?

390
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,254
No. That was just my mom being funny.

391
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,216
It comes and goes. You'll notice the signs.

392
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,885
The waves get still,
and the animals start to act funny.

393
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,929
- I went to private school, too.
- Really?

394
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,556
Except that our colors
were white and bright red.

395
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:00,682
I looked hideous.

396
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,602
She's being self-deprecating.
You looked cute in that outfit.

397
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,437
I looked like a peppermint stick.

398
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,940
That's where my addiction
to clothes comes from:

399
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,943
Making up for years of having to wear
the same thing every day.

400
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:14,071
- I can understand that.
- We should go shopping sometime...

401
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,782
- for clothes or whatever.
- Yeah. We could do that.

402
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,242
- Soon, okay?
- Sure.

403
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,953
Who wants something to drink?
I've got water, soda...

404
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,288
- Just water for me.
- Me, too.

405
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,123
Making it easy. I love it.

406
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,458
I'll help you.

407
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,460
No... Okay.

408
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,171
- You don't have to help me.
- No, I want to.

409
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,339
Great.

410
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,969
Do you want flat water or sparkling?
I hope flat, 'cause I don't have sparkling.

411
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,471
Or flat. Or ice cubes. I have cups, I think.

412
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,723
It's a little awkward, isn't it?

413
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,350
- What?
- Us.

414
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,561
You and me. Our being here.

415
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,730
- No, not really.
- But kind of, right?

416
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,482
We're just not used to company.

417
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,694
You and Christopher were so close.
I know it was years ago...

418
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,696
but these things are never simple.

419
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,615
Just in general, things like this
are always awkward...

420
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,617
slightly, but only slightly.

421
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,995
Look. Apple juice.

422
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:05,914
With a perfectly respectable
expiration date.

423
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,500
I just want you to know...

424
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,712
that you should not feel
like you need to get to know me.

425
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,005
At all.

426
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,131
Okay.

427
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:18,051
Just because Christopher and I are close
doesn't mean that we need to be close.

428
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,930
- Or friends. Or anything, for that matter.
- No, I guess not.

429
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:25,184
Except for our unexpected visit,
we may never have even met.

430
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,311
I think we would have met eventually.

431
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,062
Perhaps at some function or other.

432
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:32,065
You, me, Martin Sheen,
all chained to the same tree.

433
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,692
But I desperately want to know Rory.

434
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,986
- Sure, a great kid.
- That's okay with you?

435
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,321
That's fine.

436
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,616
I'm so glad to hear that,
because things are kind of speeding up...

437
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,993
- between me and Christopher and...
- Really?

438
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:46,205
- Rory is so important to him.
- Yeah, I know. She is.

439
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,208
He told me how he really wasn't
in her life for years...

440
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,252
and how he'd like to make up
for all that time that he wasted.

441
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,463
- He's been doing really well lately.
- I know.

442
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,715
He is obsessive about his call dates to her.

443
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,343
It doesn't matter where we are
or what we're doing...

444
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,513
he's got to call Rory
Wednesday nights at 7:00.

445
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,348
I like that about him.

446
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,059
- Yeah. Me, too.
- He wants me to bond with her, too.

447
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,394
It's important with everything
we have coming.

448
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,523
- I totally understand.
- Good. I'm glad.

449
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,902
What are the chances of Rory and I
getting together on this trip?

450
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,529
- This trip?
- How about tonight?

451
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,072
- Tonight?
- Rory seemed up for it.

452
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,408
Tonight. It's kind of last minute
and we're supposed to go somewhere.

453
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,410
The Friday-night dinner with your parents.

454
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,454
- You know about those?
- All about them.

455
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:30,541
Christopher said you can get her
out of them if there's a need.

456
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:34,044
- That's true to a certain extent, but...
- This is pressing.

457
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,505
I am so forcing myself here,
it's embarrassing.

458
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,090
But that's how important it is.

459
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,301
Who knows when this opportunity
is going to present itself again.

460
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:42,803
- Right.
- So?

461
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,223
Sure.

462
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:49,601
You'll have to ask Rory,
but if it's okay with her, it's okay with me.

463
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,603
You're as great
as Christopher said you were.

464
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:53,939
He's an excellent judge of character.

465
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,441
Okay. I'll see you back out there?

466
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,530
- Everything okay?
- Yup, she found apple juice.

467
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,575
- Rory, will you get that, please?
- Let the machine pick it up.

468
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,869
- It could be important.
- Okay.

469
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,499
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

470
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,002
I'm still in the kitchen.

471
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:17,546
I just wanted to tell you
that Sherrie asked me...

472
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,173
if both of you could go out tonight.

473
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:22,467
She trapped me into saying
I'd get you out of Friday dinner.

474
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,470
I said she had to ask you,
so you can get out of it.

475
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:29,099
But it may be good to get this over with,
'cause it seems inevitable.

476
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:33,103
If you're okay going with her,
say, 'Sorry, Leonard, I'll call you back. '

477
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,772
Sorry, Leonard, we've got company.
Call you back.

478
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,191
Okay. Bye.

479
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,153
Okay, here's your drink. Who was that?

480
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,654
That was Leonard.

481
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,865
- Did you tell him we have company?
- Yeah.

482
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:47,159
- Who's Leonard?
- A friend.

483
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,244
- Of yours or Lorelai's?
- Mutual friend.

484
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:50,621
It's pretty much equal.

485
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:53,332
- A mutual Leonard.
- We're constantly fighting over him.

486
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,168
- Rory, can I run something by you?
- Sure.

487
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,338
We're around for another night,
and he's totally sick of me.

488
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,714
Not true.

489
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:05,052
Anyhow, I was wondering if you wanted
to do something with me tonight.

490
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,221
- Sure, that would be nice.
- Really?

491
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,723
If it's okay with my mom...

492
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,392
because we do have
a Grandma-Grandpa dinner tonight.

493
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,061
- It's fine by me.
- Great.

494
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,522
Of course, this does leave you
a sad little orphan.

495
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,733
I'll have one of my patented
White Castle bachelor dinners.

496
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,486
Or you can come with me tonight,
if you want.

497
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:23,612
To your parents?

498
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,031
'Cause with Rory not there,
I might need a hostage.

499
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:28,867
- Yes, do it.
- Okay, it's good grub.

500
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:31,203
- You sure they won't be mad?
- They like you.

501
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:34,248
- True.
- We should go get cleaned up for tonight.

502
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,667
- Thanks for having us over like this.
- Anytime.

503
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,211
- We'll swing by around 6:00.
- Sounds good.

504
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:40,963
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Dad.

505
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,257
Goodbye, Leonard.

506
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:52,850
- Honey, hurry, they said 6:00.
- It's 6:00 Dad-time, so it's more like 6:30.

507
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,434
Dad-time is linked to Sherrie-time.

508
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,728
- Sherrie seems awfully punctual.
- That's annoying.

509
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,730
They have to live with their deficiencies.

510
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,899
- I'll get it.
- Lf it's Leonard, I'll call back.

511
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,484
He's so needy.

512
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,902
Hello?

513
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,405
- Humongous snag in the CD drop plan.
- What happened?

514
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,448
Bible class has been moved an hour later...

515
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,701
to accommodate
the teacher's handball schedule.

516
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,579
- The Reverend plays handball?
- I'm just as appalled.

517
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,289
It's at 10:00 instead of 9:00.

518
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:18,500
- I'll make the necessary adjustments.
- Thank you.

519
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,669
So, anything new?

520
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,838
My dad brought his girlfriend
to my debate.

521
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,090
The potential stepmom? My God.

522
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,592
What's she like? What'd she say?

523
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:29,303
Tell me in 11 seconds
'cause that's the time I have left.

524
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:32,764
- That's too much pressure.
- Then write a long, descriptive letter...

525
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:37,102
and slip it into the CD booklet.
Include a candid Polaroid of her if you can.

526
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,395
- I'll try.
- Gotta go.

527
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:39,438
Bye.

528
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,733
- Can we come in?
- Yeah, come on in.

529
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,444
- You look great.
- You, too.

530
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,779
- Hi, there. You ready to go?
- All set.

531
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,115
We won't be too late,
probably around 10:00.

532
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:53,952
If you want a drink, Rory's got the list
of places that serve minors.

533
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,329
I got a flask in my purse.

534
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:58,165
I'll have to drink a lot of coffee
to keep up with you two.

535
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,959
- Damn, our secret's been revealed.
- Bye, love.

536
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:02,753
- Have fun.
- Okay.

537
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,213
- Bye, sweets.
- Bye.

538
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,050
- There they go.
- Yeah.

539
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,053
Sherrie's excited about this.
Such a great opportunity.

540
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,722
- Thanks for making it happen.
- That's what I'm here for.

541
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,517
- Let me just get my coat, and we can go.
- Great.

542
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,437
- Can I ask you a quick question?
- Sure. What?

543
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,524
When I invited you to Rory's debate,
was Sherrie with you?

544
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:26,109
Yeah, she's been with me
the whole trip. Why?

545
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,320
You gave me no indication
that she was with you.

546
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,655
- What?
- I must have.

547
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:32,991
- No, singular pronouns all the way.
- I don't remember what I said.

548
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,869
I do. You said, 'I'll be there,'
as in just you.

549
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:39,414
I wasn't making a point of saying that.
It just came out that way.

550
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:41,750
Okay, whatever. I was just wondering.

551
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,795
It's okay that I brought Sherrie along,
isn't it?

552
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:47,798
Absolutely.
It was just a surprise, that's all.

553
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,841
Okay.

554
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,385
- You weren't trying to hide the fact?
- No.

555
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,346
Obviously you'd find out
she was with me once we arrived.

556
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,806
- Obviously.
- Okay, then.

557
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:56,974
Okay.

558
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:04,565
- So what do you think of her?
- I don't know her well enough to judge.

559
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:07,025
That's never stopped you
from judging people before.

560
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,360
I'm trying to grow.

561
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,445
She was saying
really nice things about you.

562
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:11,572
- Really?
- Yeah.

563
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,365
She said you guys had a nice talk.

564
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:16,160
If that's what she said,
then I guess we did.

565
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,578
- Lorelai, come on.
- What?

566
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:18,662
You're being cryptic.

567
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,415
- Did something happen between you two?
- No, I just...

568
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,959
I thought our conversation
was a little odd.

569
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,836
This is being less cryptic?

570
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:29,548
It's just that she went on and on about
how we never have to be friends...

571
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:33,218
or get to know each other at all
or try to force any kind of relationship.

572
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,929
Really? She never mentioned that part.

573
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,519
How come she figures
she never has to see me?

574
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:45,564
I'm sure she was trying to
make you feel at ease around her.

575
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:48,192
Because it's true,
you guys don't have to force anything.

576
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,485
Where'd she get this
'don't force it' philosophy?

577
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:51,945
- Not from me.
- You sure?

578
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,280
Yes, I'm sure.

579
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,699
So she just wants to
get to know Rory, not me.

580
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:58,994
- I did steer her toward bonding with Rory.
- But not with me.

581
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:01,371
Rory's my daughter.
Sherrie has to get to know her.

582
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:02,456
I know.

583
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,709
I wasn't purposely omitting you
or saying not to interact with you.

584
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,377
Good, so you're not having me killed?

585
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:11,173
I was going over my 'people to kilI' list,
and I don't think you were on it.

586
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:14,426
Because by the fact that Rory exists,
I am in the picture.

587
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,179
You can back off, you'll be in Sherrie's life.

588
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:18,222
Good.

589
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:22,100
Not that you thought to do the same thing
when you were in my shoes.

590
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:25,812
- What? What are you talking about?
- You had a fianc�, I believe.

591
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:27,856
- Yes. Max.
- Right. Max.

592
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,150
- That was not the same thing.
- Really?

593
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,611
Max knew Rory.
Max got close to Rory, right?

594
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,363
- Yes.
- He and I never met.

595
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:37,157
I didn't know he existed
until late in the game.

596
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:41,036
I didn't know you were engaged till you
called me from your bachelorette party.

597
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,289
I wasn't invited to the wedding.
Or did my invitation get lost?

598
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,916
You've moved a lot this past year.

599
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:49,044
- I was never part of that equation.
- Okay, maybe.

600
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,297
But trust me, you would have been part
of the equation eventually.

601
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,799
Really, Chris, you would have.

602
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:57,845
Then, trust me, Lorelai. Eventually,
you would have been part of this one.

603
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,737
- Christopher.
- Hello, Emily.

604
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:17,698
This is a surprise. Where's Rory?

605
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:21,368
A last-minute thing came up,
but I brought a good substitute.

606
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,787
Half her genes
in a nice, nifty Christopher package.

607
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,915
We're letting the freezing air get in.
Come in.

608
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,876
Is she sick?

609
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,461
There are terrible things
making the rounds these days.

610
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,838
No, she's not sick. Hi, Dad.

611
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,674
Hello, Lorelai.
Christopher, this is a surprise.

612
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,426
- A nice one, I hope.
- A very nice one.

613
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,553
- How are you, Richard?
- You're looking well.

614
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,680
So are you. You playing a lot of golf lately?

615
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,140
More like it's playing me.

616
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,726
Let's not stand here.
Come into the living room.

617
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,436
Now who wants a drink?

618
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:51,064
- Martini, Manhattan, some Scotch?
- Yes, please.

619
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,359
- You want to narrow that down?
- Hooch is hooch, Dad.

620
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,904
- I'll have a Manhattan.
- Same here.

621
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,948
- You never said where Rory is.
- Rory's not here?

622
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,868
You didn't even notice
your own granddaughter isn't here?

623
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,370
She's so quiet.
She sometimes slips in unnoticed.

624
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,788
She should work for the CIA.

625
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,999
- One cherry good for everybody?
- Fine with me.

626
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,959
- Me, too.
- Eight, please. I'm peckish.

627
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:14,338
- I noticed that Rory isn't here.
- You've got that eagle eye, Mom.

628
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:17,633
It's my fault. My girlfriend and I
were passing through town...

629
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,676
and we dropped by
Stars Hollow for a visit.

630
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,054
She and Rory are off
doing something together.

631
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,889
- You have a girlfriend?
- Sherrie.

632
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,226
- She and Rory are out together?
- I'm sorry. I should have called.

633
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,687
That would have been thoughtful.
We set a place for her at the table.

634
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:32,731
Chris is here, so it won't go to waste.

635
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,234
Normally I demand
my own customized place setting.

636
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,361
How long have you been with this woman?

637
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,905
- Eight months.
- I'll bet she's pretty.

638
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,782
Yes, she's very pretty.

639
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,326
- Something in your eye, Lorelai?
- I got it.

640
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:47,746
- You've met this woman?
- Yes, today. And she's very nice.

641
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:49,248
What does she do? Does she work?

642
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:51,875
She's the East Coast sales rep
for I'Or�al cosmetics.

643
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:55,712
- Sounds like a lot of responsibility.
- It keeps her busy, involves some travel.

644
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,172
- What are they doing?
- What?

645
00:29:57,256 --> 00:30:00,050
Rory and Christopher's friend.
What are they doing tonight?

646
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,927
Dinner and a movie. Something like that.

647
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,512
It's my fault that we didn't call.

648
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,639
- Your work has you traveling, too.
- Some.

649
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,517
Everyone thinks that traveling on business
is so glamorous.

650
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,977
But what they don't realize...

651
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,938
is that the business traveler
never sees the places he visits.

652
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:14,273
My last trip to Rome...

653
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:17,609
I spent the whole four days
in a conference room by the airport.

654
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,778
Might as well have been
in French Lick, Indiana.

655
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,489
My trips are mostly local,
just me and my Volvo.

656
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,449
- You have a Volvo?
- That's new?

657
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,286
- I just got it.
- Excellent choice. It's nice and safe.

658
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:30,747
- That's a good family car.
- It's also excellent for cranking Metallica.

659
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:34,793
Cranking Metallica. If that's some sort
of drug reference, it isn't funny.

660
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,462
So you're planning on having a family?

661
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:38,839
- What?
- With this woman.

662
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,466
Her name's Sherrie.
You're putting him on the spot here.

663
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,760
He bought a family car.
It's a natural question.

664
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,137
Dad called it a family car.

665
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,016
I'm sure the sales contract doesn't say
you have to have a family to buy it.

666
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:50,684
Though I didn't read the fine print.

667
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,020
You always drove a motorcycle before,
didn't you?

668
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,898
- I still got it.
- A family man shouldn't ride a motorcycle.

669
00:30:55,981 --> 00:31:00,194
The accidents I covered for the firm
involving motorcycles, the worst.

670
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:03,614
Grisly. They use this industrial machine...

671
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:07,284
to scrape the victims off the road
like a huge spatula.

672
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,496
- Mouthful of cherries here.
- Are you living together?

673
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,081
Get out the interrogation lamp,
why don't you?

674
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:16,335
Yeah, but we're looking
for something bigger in the Boston area.

675
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:18,295
There are a lot of nice, historical places.

676
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:20,964
Something historical in our price range
would be perfect.

677
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:23,926
You know historical homes
are infested with mold, don't you?

678
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,053
- Mold?
- It gets inside the walls...

679
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:28,222
and grows out of sight
and shoots off spores...

680
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:29,973
that slowly kill you and your family.

681
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,434
You should get a show on
the Home and Garden Channel.

682
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:34,603
When did you become
an expert on mold, Emily?

683
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:36,438
It was in the New York Times Magazine.

684
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:39,566
I wouldn't buy a place with this woman
until you look into this.

685
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,026
Sherrie.

686
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:43,487
It's gonna come down
to whatever we can afford.

687
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,030
It might be a newly-built place.

688
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:47,491
With their shoddy craftsmanship?
You don't want that.

689
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:49,201
What does that leave them, a teepee?

690
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,912
I just don't think
that Rory should miss our dinners...

691
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,206
for something other than
sickness or emergencies.

692
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:56,583
- That was the agreement.
- I'm sorry, Emily. Really.

693
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:59,962
Chris has apologized a hundred times.
How many more do you want?

694
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,422
I can call Sherrie
and have her and Rory come by.

695
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:05,008
That way, it won't be
a totally Rory-less evening.

696
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,343
That's not what I want.

697
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,262
We're desperately trying to work with you.

698
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:11,348
Working with me is one thing,
patronizing me is another.

699
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,683
Excuse me.

700
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,061
I feel horrible.

701
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,480
Don't, son. That's just Emily.

702
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,566
I'll go see what I can do.

703
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,240
You wanna tell me what's going on here?

704
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:31,451
How can you let that horrible woman
take Rory like that?

705
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,662
Calm down. It's only one night.

706
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,248
That's how it starts.
She's getting her claws into her.

707
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,457
Her claws?

708
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,960
We'll never see Rory again
if that woman has her way.

709
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:43,338
Hold it. Rory is my daughter, you know.
I have some control.

710
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:46,049
You can't let her get Rory on weekends.
It can't happen.

711
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,926
What is this about? Why are you so upset?

712
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,721
Lorelai, are you blind
or just that humiliated?

713
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:51,889
Humiliated?

714
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,266
Christopher gets his life together
with that woman.

715
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,894
- So that's good.
- It should have been you.

716
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,521
- What?
- Don't play dumb, Lorelai.

717
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:01,815
Deep down, I know you're heartbroken.

718
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,735
- I'm not heartbroken.
- I am.

719
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,154
I always pictured
the three of you together.

720
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,948
After all these years,
and the bad things that happened...

721
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,116
Rory with her parents.

722
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,495
Now that Christopher's got
his life together, it's with her, not you.

723
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:16,538
The timing was never right for us.

724
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:20,083
That's because you dawdle time away.
You could've had that effect on him.

725
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,753
It could've been you
helping him get his life together...

726
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:23,837
but you made no effort.

727
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:27,132
This comes down to something
I didn't do? Don't put that on me!

728
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:28,967
What other explanation is there?

729
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,594
He's always been crazy about you...

730
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:33,347
but you kept him at arm's length,
like you do everyone.

731
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,681
- That's not true.
- It is true.

732
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:37,476
Your destiny was to be with Christopher.
Now it's too late.

733
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,977
Then it wasn't our destiny!

734
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:43,524
So you're saying you don't have feelings
for him, that all of this is fine with you?

735
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,776
- That's not important.
- It's not?

736
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:49,404
No. What's important is that
Christopher is doing well and he's happy...

737
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:52,908
- and we should be happy for him.
- You're impossible. I need to lie down.

738
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:56,829
Tell Christopher...
Tell him whatever you like, I don't care.

739
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,919
You alone this morning?

740
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,630
No, Rory's with me.
She had to run an errand.

741
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,298
- Take whatever table you want.
- Okay.

742
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,550
You okay?

743
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:11,593
- Yeah.
- You don't seem your chipper self.

744
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:14,513
I brought sparklers.
I'll light them later and do some kicks.

745
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:17,182
I can clear the counter,
and you can play bagel hockey.

746
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:19,852
- You can't play by yourself.
- I'll play with you.

747
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:22,187
- You'll have to explain the rules.
- It's okay.

748
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,814
I'm just recovering from last night.

749
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:27,109
It was one of those nights where
you begin stepping in quicksand...

750
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:29,444
and end up with a 16-ton anvil
on your head.

751
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,738
I've had lots of those.
I'll get you some coffee.

752
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,407
Can't hurt.

753
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:36,368
- You order?
- No, just coffee.

754
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:39,246
I must have been sound asleep
when you got home last night.

755
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:40,789
You were snoring like a buzz saw.

756
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,125
I believe that's defined
as a superfluous comment.

757
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,334
Yes, you were sound asleep.

758
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:48,380
So, I'm dying to hear about
your night with Sherrie. How was it?

759
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,924
Give it to me, A to Z,
beginning to end, soup to nuts.

760
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,177
- She is what she seems.
- Details, please.

761
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,346
She's a cautious driver,
she doesn't roll through stop signs...

762
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:58,640
doesn't speed,
always signals before she turns.

763
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:01,351
Commendable, but not who I want
driving our getaway car.

764
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:03,645
- What are we robbing?
- Sephora. We'd planned it.

765
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,606
- Slipped my mind.
- What's her music taste?

766
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,066
Big Bruce Springsteen fan,
seen him 20 times.

767
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,110
Blue-collar roots or is she just slumming?

768
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:12,654
Her dad had a shoe store,
her mom taught kindergarten.

769
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:15,741
- You guys got into details.
- She was definitely in bonding mode.

770
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:16,909
What else?

771
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,786
She's very touchy-feely,
hand on the shoulder, lots of hugs.

772
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,914
- Did she try to get fresh?
- Gross.

773
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:22,998
Go on.

774
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,792
She's had one prior serious relationship
in her life.

775
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,921
- Finally, the juicy stuff.
- It lasted 11 years.

776
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:30,839
Eleven years and she never got married?

777
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:33,258
She never thought about it
because of her career...

778
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,886
- but now she is, more and more.
- Tick-tock.

779
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:38,472
In the past couple of years,
she hasn't dated anyone...

780
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:41,475
unless she thought for sure
it could be a lasting relationship.

781
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,977
And she's got specific goals now
concerning children.

782
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,188
- Here we go.
- She wants at least two.

783
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:49,608
Before she met Dad,
she was considering single parenthood.

784
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:52,194
- That's wanting kids.
- That's about it.

785
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,613
- She works for I'Or�al.
- I heard that.

786
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,532
I'm tapped. How was your night?

787
00:35:56,615 --> 00:36:00,786
Fine, just took Mom five minutes
before she left the room in tears.

788
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,622
She freaked out that you were
with Sherrie. Believe that?

789
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:05,374
- She freaked?
- Totally.

790
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:08,001
- She kept calling her 'that woman. '
- What did she think?

791
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:10,879
You'd come home and find
a rabbit boiling on the stove?

792
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,924
No, it had to do
with her and Christopher...

793
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:17,010
Anyway, eventually she came down
and had a pouty dinner.

794
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:18,512
It ended up okay?

795
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,264
- For the most part.
- Is she mad at me?

796
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,307
No, the angel child, never.

797
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,517
Here you go.

798
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,060
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

799
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,606
- I want to ask you something.
- Ask.

800
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,901
When you've thought about me
and your dad...

801
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:36,029
what have you been thinking
all these years?

802
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:38,365
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

803
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,909
did you ever picture us
potentially together...

804
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:42,953
like, 'we are family' together?

805
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:44,788
Not really.

806
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:47,624
But, sort of? It crossed your mind?

807
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,836
- I feel like I'm on The Ricki Lake Show.
- Go, Rory!

808
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:55,215
I'll admit I have pictured the three of us
living together at various times...

809
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:59,011
but in the way that all kids picture
their estranged parents living together.

810
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,346
The way they should be together,
but it's stupid.

811
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,849
- It's not stupid.
- Yeah, I've pictured it.

812
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:06,602
But I also pictured you
with Pee Wee Herman.

813
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:09,938
We lived in his playhouse,
and we'd be talking to Chairy...

814
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:13,025
- and Captain Carl would be walking by.
- Fun.

815
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:16,445
And later, I pictured you
marrying Matthew Broderick.

816
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:20,032
We lived in New York in this
great apartment in the Village...

817
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:22,367
and we would talk about
his Ferris Bueller days.

818
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,870
Think how easy Producers tickets
would be to get.

819
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:27,998
- It would be fourth row center every night.
- I'm sorry...

820
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,292
that Matthew and I
couldn't work it out, honey.

821
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,044
I'll try to get over it.

822
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:35,839
So should it have been me?

823
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:40,552
Sorry, zero hour. I have to go.
I'll be right back.

824
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,688
Come on.

825
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:04,409
- Excuse me, Mrs. Kim? I'm Kirk.
- I've known you since you were two.

826
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:06,453
That's no guarantee
that people remember me.

827
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,580
- We're in a hurry.
- I won't take up much time.

828
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:10,791
I was just wondering
what your store hours are.

829
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:14,545
For people who come to buy things,
it's 10:00 to 6:00, Sunday through Friday.

830
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:17,798
For those who wander, blocking aisles,
touching with dirty hands...

831
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:20,175
never buying, asking for 80% off,
we're closed.

832
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,385
I should jot this down.

833
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:24,847
- You said 10:00 to 6:00. That's 10:00 a. m.?
- Yes.

834
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,766
Okay. Thanks for your time.

835
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:37,734
Oh, my God. Michel, are you okay?

836
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:41,238
I've been running around
this stupid square for over an hour...

837
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:44,116
because the plan
was to drop this CD at 9:00.

838
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,909
No, it got changed to 10:00.

839
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:48,245
I told my mom,
and she said she'd pass it on.

840
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:51,123
- She didn't pass it on, did she?
- Definitely not.

841
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:52,583
The mission was a success.

842
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,668
Yes, my cardiologist will be thrilled.

843
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:57,629
- I've got a cramp.
- Can I do anything for you?

844
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,464
Get away from me, evil girl.

845
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:02,676
Never will I do anything for you again
ever, ever, never!

846
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,804
If it makes you feel any better,
you had really good form.

847
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:09,308
- You're your mother's child.
- Thank you.

848
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:14,313
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

849
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:17,733
We just wanted to say a last goodbye.
Rory's not here?

850
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,402
She went outside somewhere.
You could probably find her.

851
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:23,155
I think I will.
We had such a great time last night.

852
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,532
I hear your dinner was good.

853
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,367
Yeah, it was great.

854
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:31,121
I would love to see that house,
especially the portrait of Rory in the study.

855
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:32,498
Any way I could get a picture?

856
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,500
- I can send you one.
- That would be great.

857
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,376
- So she's outside?
- Somewhere.

858
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,671
- I'm gonna try to corral her.
- Bring her by so I can see her, too.

859
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:43,258
- Okay. Bye, Lorelai. Thanks for everything.
- You're welcome. Bye.

860
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,846
So, quite the evening of theater last night.

861
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,724
The Gilmore family players
rival the Barrymores...

862
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,851
for their sophisticated,
dramatic productions.

863
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:55,479
I never thought she'd freak
over Rory not being there.

864
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:58,524
- I never wanted you in that position.
- You couldn't have known.

865
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:02,778
- Rory's missed dinner before.
- This was compounded by other things.

866
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,071
What other things?

867
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:07,533
You should know that when it comes
to Emily Gilmore, it's never simple.

868
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:10,410
Got it. Looks like they found each other.

869
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,040
Sherrie had a really good time
last night. I hope Rory did, too.

870
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:17,376
- Yeah, she seemed to.
- Good.

871
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:22,965
So, Chris, before you go,
I have something I want to say to you.

872
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:26,552
- It's not an 'uh-oh. '
- Okay. What?

873
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:31,390
I kind of realized something
with you and Sherrie visiting...

874
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,934
and, God help me, because of what
my mother said to me.

875
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:37,396
Inspiration can come
from the unlikeliest sources.

876
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:39,606
I was just thinking, all these years...

877
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,900
no matter what my relationship status
has been...

878
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,945
whether I've been dating or hibernating
or whatever...

879
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:49,408
I think I've always had you
in the back of my mind...

880
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:52,202
you know,
the prospect of us being together.

881
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,080
But this prospect
was sort of indefinitely on hold...

882
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:59,084
while you found yourself
and got your personal life together...

883
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:03,130
so that you could really be there for me
and especially for Rory.

884
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,383
But you and I
have been so linked in my mind...

885
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:11,388
that I think I've unconsciously sabotaged
every decent relationship I've had...

886
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,850
including the one with Max,
because I was waiting for you.

887
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:17,352
And I shouldn't have been.
Now that I see that...

888
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:21,940
and I see you settling down with Sherrie,
I think I can move beyond it.

889
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:27,613
- Good, I'm really glad it's good for you.
- It is.

890
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:32,409
How dare you put that on me?

891
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,786
- I'm just thanking you.
- Well, don't.

892
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,706
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

893
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:41,210
Damn it, Lorelai. You're dumping
15 years of unhappiness on me?

894
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:45,005
Fifteen years of not having healthy,
lasting relationships on me?

895
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:49,301
You're blaming me for breaking up with
Max and not marrying? That's my fault?

896
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:52,429
- I did nothing to deserve that.
- I'm not saying that you did.

897
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:54,473
- You're as good as saying it.
- No, I'm not.

898
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:58,519
What did you expect from this divine
revelation you've been so kind to share?

899
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:02,147
Did you want me to apologize for ruining
your life or comfort you and say:

900
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:06,235
'There, there. Everything will be all right,'
so you can feel okay? Forget it!

901
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,905
If there's anything you feel bad about,
you want to dump on my doorstep...

902
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:11,615
just leave a note.

903
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:01,832
English
