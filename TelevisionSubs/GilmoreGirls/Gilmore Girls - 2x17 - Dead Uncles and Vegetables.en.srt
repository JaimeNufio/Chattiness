1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,798
We're not in, so...
Bashed my thumb. Leave a message.

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,801
I'm tired of this ridiculous machine.
I get it every time...

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:10,969
That was close.

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,430
...Rory are always out.
What is it that you do?

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,808
Is your house that awful you can't be in it?
It's too much excitement.

6
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,769
What isn't in Emily's rules of conduct?

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,146
I don't want to talk to a machine.
Call you later.

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:25,234
If you had your way, you'd lock us up
like veal. You want veal children.

9
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,320
We're not in, so...
Bashed my thumb. Leave a message.

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,114
- It's me again...
- You are talking to a machine.

11
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,825
...don't forget that
my DAR meeting's on Tuesday...

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,161
It's burned into my brain.
It's there forever.

13
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,497
...and the women
are all extremely punctual.

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,834
When I'm senile and gaga
and drooling into a cup...

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,961
and I can't remember my name...

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,631
I'll still remember
that your DAR meeting is that Tuesday.

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,008
I'll talk to you
about some other things later.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,469
I'd have to be deprogrammed
by cult deprogrammers...

19
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,847
to get that Tuesday out of my brain.

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,350
We're not in, so...
Bashed my thumb. Leave a message.

21
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,353
- Your phone message is annoying...
- Unbelievable.

22
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,105
...you know how annoying it is?

23
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,024
I think I have a standard
against which to measure it.

24
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,484
...you heard it lately?

25
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,611
Can't because I'm amputating my ears.

26
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,865
...don't say your name.
That thumb bashing thing, is that a joke?

27
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,867
Why is that your jokes are always...

28
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,244
An earless world, what a dream.

29
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,932
Haven't you already tasted
that soup twice, Mom?

30
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,559
- You keeping a running count?
- I'm morbidly fascinated.

31
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,396
When you're tasting anything,
the first taste acclimates the palate...

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,900
the second establishes a foundation,
the third is to make your decision.

33
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,237
- Gonna be a third one.
- Isn't it what this is for, to taste the soup?

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,031
Taste, yes. Not to orally deduce
their chemical structures.

35
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,574
Everything has to be at your pace.

36
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,537
A pace that can't be measured by the
number of times the earth circles the sun.

37
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,038
- Actually, I've heard that.
- What?

38
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,250
One is to acclimate, two is for foundation,
and three is to judge.

39
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,419
- Traitor.
- The women in my group are very picky.

40
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,173
When the pat� at the meeting
Heddy Covington organized...

41
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:56,426
was less chilled than appropriate,
she was ostracized for a month.

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,887
- That hussy Heddy had it coming.
- Lorelai.

43
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,306
They're on time for once. Good.

44
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,726
- Do me a favor and tell Michel that...
- Lorelai, please.

45
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,978
Thanks.

46
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:11,191
I got a lot of other things happening.
They can't come to a grinding halt for this.

47
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,152
Your full attention for a short period
is too much to ask for?

48
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,532
I'm giving you more attention than I would
someone in these circumstances.

49
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,995
No one else would get eight separate
soups to taste for a lousy DAR... Sorry.

50
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,123
A not-lousy DAR meeting.
We only do this for weddings.

51
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,669
- Would you like me to pay for the tasting?
- No, just decide in this calendar year.

52
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,504
Can I... I'm sorry.

53
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,175
The mushroom is a great choice.
It's super-popular...

54
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,594
and it's my Jackson's favorite.

55
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,597
- Whose?
- Jackson, my fianc�.

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,516
- You're getting married?
- To the best man in the world.

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,768
While we're on the subject,
bridesmaids' outfits.

58
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,188
I'm way ahead of you.
Already got a couple of ideas.

59
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,315
Is one of them having me design
and make them...

60
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,194
so I don't secretly hate what you pick
and harbor a secret grudge against you?

61
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,653
- It is now.
- I'll do it.

62
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,905
We're a good team.

63
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,490
That fellow's on the phone
from the restaurant.

64
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,035
- Who?
- The flannel man with protruding ankles.

65
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,246
I forgot his name from the desk to here.
That's how memorable he is.

66
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,456
Okay, thank you.

67
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,333
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Luke.

68
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,668
- Can't you call him back?
- Have your third taste.

69
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,047
Lorelai! Is she always this scattered?

70
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,550
- She's the stablest person I know.
- That's very sad.

71
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,555
- I think you're right. Mushroom.
- Great.

72
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,935
- Tell me more about your wedding.
- Just started planning, not much to tell.

73
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,231
Have you decided on anything yet?
Location or the music for the ceremony?

74
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,400
We'll probably just wind up playing
something off a CD.

75
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,945
What?

76
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,615
CD's can be very unreliable.
They break sometimes or they skip...

77
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,868
or the person assigned
to turn them on and off gets distracted...

78
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,912
and the whole ceremony is ruined.

79
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,374
- I hadn't thought of that.
- Have you thought about live music?

80
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,585
- A nice string ensemble.
- That sounds nice.

81
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,547
There are a couple of wonderful groups
I could recommend.

82
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,259
- Sure. It doesn't hurt to check them out.
- No, it doesn't.

83
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,350
- Mushroom soup.
- String quartet.

84
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,480
- Luke?
- Yeah. Hi.

85
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,942
- How's it going?
- Pretty good. How's things with you?

86
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,612
Not bad. Dropped some eggs.
Hazard of the business.

87
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,533
- Am I catching you at a bad time?
- No, it's kind of slow here.

88
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,578
So slow that Michel and I
were about to get the tetherball out.

89
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,663
The thing with the ball tethered to a rope?

90
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,082
I never knew that's where
the tether comes from.

91
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,127
Yeah, it's tied like an anchor
is tethered to a rope on a boat.

92
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,253
Neat.

93
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,464
- Most people don't put that together.
- Probably not.

94
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,635
- So anything else?
- Yeah, actually.

95
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:48,265
If I needed a room or two
for a couple of days, would it be possible?

96
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,475
- You need rooms?
- Like, nine.

97
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,520
- You need nine rooms?
- Just for a couple of days.

98
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:57,482
- Wednesday and Thursday.
- I can take care of that. What's it for?

99
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,278
- I just got some family coming in.
- Reunion? We can get the tetherball out.

100
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,322
- No, funeral.
- What?

101
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:08,118
Yeah, my uncle Louie died last night,
and I'm arranging the funeral for him.

102
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,623
Luke, I'm so sorry.
Here I was babbling about tetherball.

103
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,292
- You weren't babbling.
- You've got nine rooms.

104
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,127
- Wednesday and Thursday.
- You sure?

105
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,837
- It's a done deal.
- Thanks.

106
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,672
I'm so sorry.

107
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,759
It's okay. It sounds like he went peaceful.
He was 85.

108
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,179
But it's always hard. You okay?

109
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,516
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Can I help you with anything else?

110
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,392
No, the rooms are help enough.

111
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,770
Are you sure?
'Cause, I'm dealing with my mom now...

112
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,231
and I'd be happy to rush over
and help with whatever.

113
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,482
You'd be doing me a favor.

114
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,067
The rooms are all I need. Thanks.

115
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,361
- You're welcome.
- I got to go.

116
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,030
- Call if you need anything.
- I will.

117
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,658
That French guy is a putz.

118
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,452
- Yeah. He knows.
- All right. See ya.

119
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,578
Bye.

120
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,042
- It's so sad.
- I know.

121
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,045
Was Luke shaken over his uncle dying?

122
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,589
I don't know. He's so unflappable.
It's hard to tell.

123
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,175
The man definitely can't be flapped.

124
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,488
- Can I get another cup of coffee?
- In a minute.

125
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,365
- Is that my food?
- More coffee here, too.

126
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,033
- In a minute.
- Is that my food?

127
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,035
- More coffee for me, too.
- Shut up, Kirk.

128
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,871
- Is that my food?
- Yes, that's your food.

129
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,956
- Can I have it?
- I'm doing all I can, folks.

130
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,875
- I asked nicely.
- Watch the cord.

131
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,460
- Try ducking.
- You should update to a cordless.

132
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,046
- What are you doing?
- Thanks. I'm on the phone.

133
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,424
- We noticed.
- I can't serve and be on the phone.

134
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,550
We noticed that, too.

135
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,928
Your reenactment of Jerry Lewis
in The Diner Guy will wow the critics.

136
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,264
- Where do the poached eggs go?
- Crank in the hat.

137
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,100
- I'm not a crank. You are a crank.
- He is a crank.

138
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,604
- And the French toast?
- The lady with the giant purse.

139
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,648
- This is not good.
- Fall back, cowboy.

140
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,275
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

141
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,110
Stay on the phone and give me these.

142
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,154
- Where do they go?
- Table by the window.

143
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,739
- Don't you number your tables?
- No.

144
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,240
You should number your tables.

145
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,243
If I said a number, you wouldn't know
what table's what number.

146
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,496
- But all restaurants number their tables.
- They go to table five.

147
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,874
- Cool. Which one is that?
- The table by the window.

148
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,918
- By the window, Wilma.
- Got it, Gertie.

149
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,128
- How about that coffee?
- I got it.

150
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,421
Thanks.

151
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,759
But mine's a quarter caf. Three-fourths
decaf, one-fourth caffeinated.

152
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,094
- And four-fourths don't care.
- Fill it up.

153
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,471
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.

154
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,182
The world's full of people
who micromanage their lives...

155
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,601
to the point where they can't wait
an extra second.

156
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,978
- We're running out of coffee.
- I'll make some more.

157
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,605
- No, I got it.
- Do you know how?

158
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,024
Do I? I'm Cathy Coffee, mister...

159
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,693
the bastard offspring
of Mrs. Folger and Juan Valdez.

160
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,487
- Where's Jess?
- I don't know.

161
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,822
- School?
- Please. Probably upstairs.

162
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,533
Really? Excuse me.

163
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,076
- It's too strong.
- It's not.

164
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,662
- You're on the phone.
- Not everyone likes it strong.

165
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,374
Then I shall convert them.
I'm the Jehovah's coffee girl.

166
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,759
Jess, open up. I know you're in there.

167
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,512
Aren't we bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

168
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,305
- Luke needs you downstairs.
- Why?

169
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,976
He's on the phone, Caesar's off today,
the place is packed. He needs help.

170
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,687
- I'll be down in a minute.
- No. Now.

171
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,230
I'm in the middle of something.

172
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,650
Assume that Jeanie's gonna get
Major Healey out of whatever he's in.

173
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,360
Thanks for spoiling it for me.

174
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,323
- I need some more Equal.
- There's one right there.

175
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,449
I need seven.

176
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,287
You're not squirreling these away
in your pocket for home use, are you?

177
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,708
- No, I use seven in my coffee.
- Okay. Good. Then allow me.

178
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,839
There you go.
Go ahead and give that a taste.

179
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,341
- See if it's to your liking.
- Okay.

180
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,431
- Perfection.
- Good.

181
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,059
- You're very graceful.
- She pushed me.

182
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,853
- Sue me.
- I could've broken my neck.

183
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,981
As long as it's not your arm.
We need your arm.

184
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,526
Despot.

185
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,489
It took me 20 minutes to get past
this place's busy signal...

186
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,409
- then they put me on hold forever.
- Who's keeping you on hold?

187
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,494
That mortuary in Florida
where my uncle's at.

188
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,038
I thought he was in the area.

189
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,249
He spent most of his life here
but retired to Orlando.

190
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,460
So I got to ship the body back here.

191
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,337
He wanted to be buried in Stars Hollow?

192
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,632
No. My dad wanted my uncle buried
here right next to him.

193
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,925
That's nice.

194
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,428
They were close, and Louie didn't have
a family to look out for things.

195
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,056
Before my dad died,
he asked me if I'd look out for him.

196
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,140
Good Louie.

197
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,518
He wanted me to make sure
he got a proper funeral.

198
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,229
- Respectful, dignified.
- No horseshoe carnation wreaths.

199
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,022
Got it. Good man, that dad of yours.

200
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,774
And since Louie's a war veteran...

201
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,569
the town Revolutionary War re-enactors
will attend the service...

202
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,238
do the salute thing.

203
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,990
It makes me nauseous,
but my dad wanted it.

204
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,076
Yeah. Hi. I'm still here.

205
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,621
Yes, the deceased is Louie Danes. Right.

206
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,834
No, Hartford's not too far.
I can do that. Thanks.

207
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,087
Great. That's done. Okay.

208
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,131
I should probably go
pick out a coffin before he gets here.

209
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,258
Great. Go.

210
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,301
- I have to close up.
- No. You're covered.

211
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,137
- You don't have to do this.
- We don't mind. Go.

212
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,641
- Gives me a chance to number the tables.
- Be my guest.

213
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,352
Are they arranged like this
for any particular reason?

214
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,855
- Don't change anything.
- It's totally not Feng Shui.

215
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,314
- Gertie.
- Go.

216
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,493
Excuse me, Taylor,
where are your Brussels sprouts?

217
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,872
My supplier was out of them this week,
Mrs. Cassini. Maybe next week.

218
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,040
- I wanted to make them tonight.
- Sorry.

219
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,751
Okay. I'll just try across the street.

220
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,254
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

221
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,591
Across the street?

222
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,846
What is that?

223
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,224
It's a farmer's market. Isn't it wonderful?

224
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,811
It just opened this morning,
and I see sprouts.

225
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,567
Who's the proprietor here?

226
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,861
That would be me. What can I do for you?

227
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,988
Wait a minute. I know you.

228
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,366
You're that long-haired freak
that wanted to be town troubadour...

229
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,579
even though that weird brown-corduroyed-
jacket-wearing freak was already it.

230
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,664
That's right. Good memory. How are you?

231
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,292
- Let go of me.
- Don't like to be touched. That's cool.

232
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,795
Got a David and Lisa thing happening.
Made a mental note. No problem.

233
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,880
Can I help you?

234
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,841
I want to know what inspired you
to open a produce stand...

235
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,093
right across the street from my market?

236
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,846
- Is that your market?
- Yes, that's my market.

237
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,724
It's real nice. Homey.
Bought a box of tissues there.

238
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,726
Good stuff.

239
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,394
Excuse me.

240
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,773
Your parsley,
is it priced per bunch or per pound?

241
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,025
- Per pound, beautiful.
- Good deal.

242
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,402
- Patty.
- Hi, Taylor. How are you?

243
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,072
You mean not counting
the knife sticking in my back?

244
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,990
Sure, honey, whatever.

245
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,910
There must be some mistake.
This just isn't right.

246
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,788
It's approved by the proper authorities.
I followed the rules.

247
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,500
It's what Dad taught me. Cop for 20 years,
got shot in the butt. Good man.

248
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,877
Tips over sometimes when he sits,
but good man.

249
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,755
- Beautiful sprouts.
- For a beautiful lady.

250
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:18,924
Thank you.

251
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,718
- I feel sick.
- That'll be $4.

252
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,971
- See you, Mr. Doose.
- I want to lie down.

253
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,767
Lorelai, good. Tell me
about the nine rooms set aside here...

254
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:33,146
there's no name anywhere that I can see,
and no credit card to hold them. Mistake?

255
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,940
- No, it's for Luke.
- For whom?

256
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,694
- Luke from Luke's diner.
- Nine rooms for Luke from Luke's diner.

257
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,613
- French Fry convention?
- No, just personal.

258
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:45,033
- Milkshake symposium?
- No, it's personal. I'm vouching for him.

259
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:47,077
- Soda pop seminar?
- Stop.

260
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,789
- Pickle party?
- He's got nine rooms. Now stifle.

261
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,377
- Mom, hi there.
- Lorelai, hello.

262
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,298
I'm sorry. Did we get our signals crossed?
I don't have an appointment with you.

263
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,550
We have to make appointments
to see each other?

264
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,970
- No. But... good one.
- I'm not here to see you.

265
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,890
- This isn't about the DAR meeting?
- No, that's ready to go.

266
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,017
- I'm here to meet with Sookie.
- Sookie?

267
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,812
I'm a little late. Traffic was awful.
Excuse me, would you?

268
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,486
- Oh, my God.
- Aren't they beautiful?

269
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,488
- Gorgeous. What are they for?
- My wedding.

270
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,741
- Your wedding?
- Emily, hi!

271
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,285
- Is this everything I said it was?
- And more.

272
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,204
What do you mean
they're for your wedding?

273
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,457
It's this company's sample place setting.
Emily set me up with them.

274
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:36,627
They did Celine Dion's wedding
and Steven Spielberg's daughter's...

275
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,547
- Jack Russell Terrier's 'bark' mitzvah.
- You're putting me on.

276
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,216
I couldn't make that up.

277
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,844
Excuse me. This one's slightly
asymmetrical. Fix, please.

278
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:50,599
What is with the fancy place settings?
I thought you were gonna keep it simple.

279
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:51,683
It is simple.

280
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,353
- It lights up.
- Just flip a switch. Simple.

281
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:57,940
- How did my mother get so involved?
- She's not that involved.

282
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,984
She just mentioned the other day
that she knew some people...

283
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:05,030
that could make samples of stuff for us,
like table settings, flower arrangements.

284
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,659
- We were gonna do the flowers ourselves.
- But what a hassle that would be.

285
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,702
It's to save money. Flowers cost a lot.

286
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,455
But the sampling
of what they're doing today is free.

287
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,707
- I'm not committed to any of this.
- I hope not.

288
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,960
It's true. I say no, it all goes away.

289
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,545
- Not a penny is spent.
- Okay.

290
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,381
- And it's fun.
- I don't want to take away your fun.

291
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,884
I just want you to be careful.
You've entered 'Emily-land. '

292
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:29,513
It's an upside-down world
where the Horchow house is low-rent...

293
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:32,391
and diamonds less than 24 carats
are Cracker Jack trinkets...

294
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,935
and Bentleys are for losers
who can't afford a Rolls.

295
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,895
- But I'm okay. Really.
- All right.

296
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,398
I have to help Luke with the lunch rush,
so I gotta go.

297
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,068
- Go. We're fine.
- Okay. Bye, Mom.

298
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:47,531
Is that a fingerprint? My god!
That's a fingerprint! Who touched this?

299
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,824
Let me see your hands.

300
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,743
Turnips, butternut...

301
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,788
- Turnips.
- What?

302
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,541
- What about turnips?
- Why did you say 'turnips?'

303
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,501
- Because you said 'turnips. '
- No, I didn't.

304
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:03,297
- I think you did.
- No, but I've got turnips. Good ones, too.

305
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:07,968
They're not as big as that crinite freak's,
but who needs bloated turnips?

306
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:12,055
Mine are unassuming.
I have nice, humble turnips.

307
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,515
Okey-dokey.

308
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,560
Taylor's wigging.

309
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,938
He's been sitting there like the final days
of Dick Nixon for an hour.

310
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,773
Keep an eye on him.

311
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,945
- Hello, there. How's it going?
- Very good, young lady.

312
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:30,073
- Still serving breakfast?
- We serve it all day. What'll you have?

313
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,284
- Two eggs up on toast.
- Up, huh?

314
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,578
- Yeah.
- Wouldn't you rather have scrambled?

315
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,748
- Nope, up's how I like them.
- Scrambled's better. Give it a shot.

316
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,167
Say you want two scrambled eggs
on toast, please.

317
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,003
Okay, young lady.
Two scrambled eggs on toast.

318
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:47,925
Adam and Eve on a raft and wreck 'em.
That's real live diner talk.

319
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,053
- The 'wreck 'em' is the scrambled part.
- I deduced that.

320
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,972
- I don't believe it.
- What's the matter?

321
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,975
That's Babette with an armload
of rutabaga.

322
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:01,188
And there's Miss Patty again.
Since when does she eat so much fruit?

323
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,316
- Hi, Kirk.
- Hello.

324
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,236
- Where's Luke?
- He's busy with some stuff...

325
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,530
so Rory and I are helping out.
What can I get you?

326
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,032
I want lunch, but I'm not sure what to get.

327
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,494
I have a suggestion: A hamburger
with some strawberry ice cream...

328
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,746
- with chocolate sauce for dessert?
- Sounds good.

329
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,833
Yo, burn one, then pass me a pink stick
and throw some mud on it!

330
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,668
God, I love this business.

331
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,212
Boy, it's freezing out there.

332
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:29,007
Yes, it's quite a cold snap.
How about a hot blonde with sand?

333
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,094
Coffee with cream and sugar
would be great. Thanks.

334
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,848
- Make sure its foot's out the door.
- Put it in a cup to go. Got it.

335
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,184
This icy weather hasn't
kept customers away. They keep coming.

336
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,812
A lot of vegetable soup
being eaten tonight, yessiree.

337
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:44,982
I hope I don't put the good people
at CampbelI's out of business.

338
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,651
Hey, Taylor. Didn't notice you there.

339
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,028
- Hello.
- Taking a little break?

340
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,656
I don't see how if you're anywhere near
as busy as I am.

341
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,575
Keep waiting for a lull, never get one.

342
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,869
I say to the people, 'I'll be back in a jiff. '

343
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,996
Look at them.
They're lining up there already.

344
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,082
FYI, Van Halen hair, I'm plenty busy.

345
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:06,378
But a good, well-groomed businessman
with properly prepared staff...

346
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,005
can take a break now and then.

347
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,382
Probably helped that
your store was dead, too.

348
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,427
- It was not dead.
- I thought it was closed when I walked by.

349
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,096
Then I saw Gabby at the cash register
reading a tabloid...

350
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,890
- Shut up.
- Tapping on the counter...

351
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,184
- with one of those astrological scrolls.
- Enough.

352
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,228
- Here you go.
- Gracias. Boy, it's a mob scene.

353
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,572
Luke, it's me.

354
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,658
Brought you a wimpy
with a rose pinned on it.

355
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,827
- A what?
- A turkey burger with onions.

356
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:42,414
- Thanks. Come on.
- How's the money pit coming?

357
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:46,418
- Just... That's it.
- What's the matter?

358
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,426
- None of them are coming, not one.
- Who?

359
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,637
My relatives,
the ones I booked the rooms for.

360
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,806
- Not one is coming to Louie's funeral.
- You're kidding. Why?

361
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,892
Which lame-o excuse
do you want to hear first?

362
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,020
- A bunch claim they can't get out of work.
- That's not so lame-o.

363
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,190
Randy and Barbara don't want to miss
their kid's rugby semifinal.

364
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,859
- Rugby has semifinals?
- My sister never even called back.

365
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,695
My cousins that
my dad helped put through college...

366
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,989
said they were too exhausted
from a fishing trip.

367
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:20,953
And slightly disturbed cousin Frannie said
she can't leave because her Petey's sick.

368
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,287
- Son?
- Parrot.

369
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,706
- Petey, the parrot?
- I saw the stupid thing once...

370
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,959
flapping its wings like crazy,
banging around...

371
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,129
squawking the only two words it knows
over and over: 'Petey' and 'gorgeous. '

372
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,090
Gorgeous. Petey.

373
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,759
- That's disturbing.
- My family's disturbing.

374
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,302
I'm so sorry.

375
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,430
This is wrong. This is not how it's done.

376
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,808
A family member dies,
you pay your respects, period.

377
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,561
If they don't want to be there,
you don't want them there.

378
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,980
- My dad wanted them to be there.
- I know.

379
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:52,651
Louie lived in Stars Hollow most of his life.
So people from here will be there, right?

380
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:53,902
Right.

381
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,989
I know it's upsetting,
but maybe it's better this way.

382
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:00,450
Yeah, I guess. I really hate that bird.

383
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,829
What's up? You got a herd of bulls
shopping for china?

384
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,997
- What?
- Customers.

385
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,623
How long have you owned a diner?

386
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,376
Sorry. Jackson wants to talk to you.
Says it's important.

387
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,837
- About what?
- I don't know. He seems upset.

388
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,590
- All right. You okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

389
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,427
- You might want to study that diner talk.
- I'll do that tonight.

390
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,597
- Where's Jess?
- Probably out playing basketball.

391
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,682
That little punk.

392
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,854
Can I take your order?

393
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:32,107
Yes. Bacon, lettuce,
and tomato sandwich, no mayo.

394
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,988
I need a piggy-piggy with a green bed...
Green blanket.

395
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,866
BLT, no mayo. Rats.

396
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,457
- I'm a miserable man.
- What's up?

397
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,377
Remember that sweet, simple, affordable,
little wedding Sookie and I agreed on...

398
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:56,381
with minimal disagreement, none in fact,
perhaps the first time in the history...

399
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,259
of wedding planning that a couple
agreed 100% on everything?

400
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,595
- Yes.
- Gone. Ancient history.

401
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,348
It's the library of Alexandria,
the colossus of Rhodes.

402
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,892
It's Pop Rocks. It's over.
And do you know why?

403
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,644
- My mother?
- Look.

404
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,104
- What are they doing?
- They're measuring the town.

405
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,024
They're measuring the entire town
with tape measures.

406
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,444
Your mother got hers at Neiman Marcus.
It's platinum with gold leaf.

407
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:20,030
- Costs more than my car.
- I'm so sorry.

408
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,575
I love Sookie, and I want her
to have what she wants.

409
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:27,079
But... You see what they're doing now?

410
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,874
According to their diagrams,
that's where the 16-piece orchestra goes.

411
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:34,002
How are they gonna fit
a 16-piece orchestra in the gazebo?

412
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,963
- They want to move the gazebo.
- What?

413
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,341
A gazebo that's been there for 100 years,
and they want to move it.

414
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,592
Who moves a gazebo?

415
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:44,555
What kind of twisted mind even thinks
about moving a gazebo?

416
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,932
- Okay. I'll take care of this.
- She's so excited.

417
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,686
She's brainwashed. She's Patricia Hearst
and my mother is the SLA.

418
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,146
- I just hope it's not too late.
- I hope so, too.

419
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,232
- Watch the shirt.
- Cork it.

420
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:07,161
- It seems the right thing to do, Taylor.
- I concur.

421
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,454
When one gazes at Stars Hollow...

422
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:12,791
one can easily overlook a vital component
of its beauty...

423
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,336
and that's the humble,
yet spunky twinkle light.

424
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,755
- Holy cow.
- It doesn't get fruitier.

425
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:22,968
Harry's House of Twinkle Lights has been
an integral part of this town for 20 years...

426
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,596
so it's only right
that we honor his retirement.

427
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,224
So I hereby designate next Tuesday,
'Harry, the Twinkle Light Man...

428
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:31,768
'from Harry's House
of Twinkle Lights' day.

429
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,354
That just trips off the tongue.

430
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,317
- Late again, are we?
- Yes. I hope I'm not pregnant.

431
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,401
What?

432
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,528
- Are these seats taken?
- Don't drag me in this.

433
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:45,491
You have to work on your punctuality.
I banged the meeting in a half an hour ago.

434
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:46,617
Dirty.

435
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:50,204
I'm gonna take advantage of this
unexpected pause in our proceedings...

436
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:53,040
to confer with Miss Patty
about the next item on our agenda.

437
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,666
- What did we miss?
- Harry's retiring.

438
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,793
What do we do for twinkle lights?

439
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,962
- Go to any discount store.
- Blasphemy.

440
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,631
What are you doing here, anyhow?

441
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:04,343
This is a town meeting for people who
participate in and care about the town.

442
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,095
Corky's Country Cavalcade
on public access was pre-empted.

443
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,516
- Thought I'd check out the next best thing.
- I'm surprised to see you.

444
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,894
I haven't been able to get any
of the war re-enactors on the phone...

445
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,104
and I have to confirm them
for Louie's funeral.

446
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:19,525
The last order of business is a matter
relating personally to me.

447
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:23,028
- So I'm going to give Miss Patty my gavel.
- Again. Dirty.

448
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,240
Stop that. Now, don't go power mad.

449
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,868
All right. Gee.

450
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,166
The chair recognizes Taylor Doose.
Taylor, you have the floor.

451
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,459
Thank you, Patty.

452
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:40,546
My issue, ladies and gentlemen,
is in the form of a grievance...

453
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:44,758
against this hirsute hippie
who opened a produce stand in the park.

454
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,219
- Oh, yeah. Killer veggies.
- Tasty.

455
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:51,265
- His squash is beautiful.
- Sexy. It's sexy squash.

456
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:55,811
Sexy or not, I demand that this man
produce his permit posthaste.

457
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,563
Got it right here.

458
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:04,611
Just what I thought. This is not the proper
permit for this kind of business.

459
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:09,366
This is a Type 24B. Otherwise known
as a Cart, Kiosk, Cart/Kiosk permit.

460
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:13,453
- This is not valid for your business.
- Why does it say it twice?

461
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:16,081
You said, 'Cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk. '

462
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:18,500
- It's repetitive.
- And redundant.

463
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:21,170
- We certainly are entertaining, Mac.
- Indubitably, Tosh.

464
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:24,089
It's not redundant.
It's three separate things.

465
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:26,967
It's a cart, a kiosk,
and a mechanical hybrid...

466
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,970
referred to as a cart/kiosk.

467
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,972
Hence, cart, kiosk, cart/kiosk.

468
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,140
He did it again.

469
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,434
He's been stressed lately.
His store is deserted.

470
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,810
I'll make it simple:

471
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:40,939
This is for businesses that roll in
in the morning and roll out at night.

472
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,566
Emphasis on the word 'roll. '

473
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,736
Rolling businesses. Businesses that roll.

474
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,863
But I carry my tables out at night.

475
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:52,618
You're supposed to roll them, Rapunzel,
and carrying isn't rolling, is it?

476
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:56,747
I mean, did anyone hear the word 'rolling'
come out of his mouth?

477
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:00,459
Check the transcript.
You'll find one word missing: Rolling.

478
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:03,378
- Transcript?
- Taylor, this isn't Charlie Rose.

479
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:05,088
He's losing his marbles.

480
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,258
- It's just a personal vendetta.
- His store is deserted.

481
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,137
- I think we should end the meeting here.
- Wait a second.

482
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,392
You, there, when Lady Godiva here
wanted to be town troubadour over you...

483
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:20,145
I stood by your side.
Why aren't you backing me now?

484
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:24,274
'Cause you left me twisting for a long time
before you did, and it didn't feel good.

485
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:25,984
I wrote a song about the experience.

486
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,904
I heard it.
It's called Taylor Left Me Twisting.

487
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,656
- It's really good.
- You think?

488
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,825
'Cause I'm having trouble with the chorus.

489
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:36,537
Taylor left me twisting
He set my eyes a-misting

490
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,040
- I'm not sure if it has that thing, though.
- No, I love that part.

491
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:44,211
I actually thought that maybe at the end,
you could do more about the sweater.

492
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,337
We'll talk.

493
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,047
I'm gonna wrap this up.

494
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:51,218
Patty, how would you feel
if this guy decided to open...

495
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:55,973
the Longhaired Freak School of Dance?
Or the Longhaired Freak Diner, Luke?

496
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:59,643
Or the Longhaired Freak Bookstore?
It's not good, right?

497
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:03,689
Everybody who agrees that we would
not feel good about that, say aye.

498
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,608
Meeting adjourned. Good night.

499
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,027
Taylor, hold on a sec.

500
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:12,865
Don't you have some cleaning up
to do over at the diner?

501
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,162
Guys, come on.
You heard me calling you. Stop.

502
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,540
- What is it, Luke?
- My uncle Louie's funeraI's tomorrow.

503
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,417
I haven't heard from any of you.

504
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,129
He was a World War II veteran,
and that's what you re-enactor freaks do...

505
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,549
you go to vets' funerals.
So you're gonna be there, right? Hello?

506
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:33,927
- You said you were gonna talk to him.
- Burt said he was gonna do it.

507
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,221
- It's Taylor's job.
- You always pass it on.

508
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,640
- Talk to me about what?
- You might as well know.

509
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:40,851
- We don't want to go to Louie's funeral.
- What?

510
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,645
- We all hated Louie.
- That's not true.

511
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:47,357
He always had a scowl on his face,
not a kind word for anybody.

512
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:50,903
He would light those hideous cigars,
blow smoke in people's faces...

513
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,030
and then spit after each puff.

514
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,908
- He was disgusting.
- He kicked my dog when I was a kid.

515
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,286
- He hit on my wife repeatedly.
- Toto was always different after that.

516
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,871
My wife was much affected as well.

517
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:05,125
I'd toss her something to fetch. She'd run
after it and then forget about it.

518
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:08,837
- She stopped enjoying her soap operas.
- She'd just lie down and go to sleep.

519
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,632
- This is an exaggeration.
- We're not exaggerating.

520
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,467
We threw a big party when he left town.

521
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,261
I made love to my wife that night
like I never have.

522
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:19,890
My Toto barked a happy bark, then quietly
stopped breathing. She was old.

523
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,768
- I don't believe this.
- You knew the guy.

524
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,395
This man was my uncle,
and a war veteran.

525
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:29,274
He deserves a veteran's funeral.
But, if you guys are too lazy to show up...

526
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:33,737
He's the lazy one. Never once
did he participate in a town function.

527
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,532
When we re-enactors gathered,
he'd throw things at us.

528
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:40,202
- And not soft things. Hard things.
- Rocks and small tools.

529
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,453
I've heard enough.

530
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:44,706
And he got meaner as he got older.
Never married, never had kids.

531
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,126
- A real loner.
- To hell with you guys. Who needs you?

532
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:53,173
I might throw rocks and small tools myself
next time I see you.

533
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:56,885
- A defensive hothead just like Louie.
- Practically clones.

534
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:01,265
Oh, my god. This is so high tech.

535
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,808
What's going on?

536
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,060
I'm downloading wedding stuff
from Prague.

537
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,813
- You're kidding.
- It's streaming in right now.

538
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,524
That's Internet talk. Streaming.
Did you know that?

539
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:14,152
It's not called Czechoslovakia anymore.
Just Czech Republic.

540
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:17,406
Slovakia is its own separate thing.
It's weird, isn't it?

541
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,993
Like saying there's no more Connecticut.
It's just 'Connec' and 'Ticut. '

542
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:25,080
- What are you downloading from Prague?
- This will much amuse you.

543
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:28,750
- Color samples for the big ceramic stands.
- Stands for what?

544
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,962
- For the giant papier-mach� mushrooms.
- What are the mushrooms for?

545
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:35,007
For the midgets dressed like angels
to dance under, silly.

546
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,133
Oh, my God.

547
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:39,386
Emily found the best papier-mach�
mushroom maker in Paris.

548
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:42,264
He's much better than the guy
in Belgium. What a hack.

549
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:45,017
I need you to stop staring at the screen.
We need to talk.

550
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,977
Please don't talk her out of these things.

551
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:50,314
I do not want to die without seeing
midgets dancing with mushrooms.

552
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,065
- Stay out of this.
- You're no fun.

553
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,233
What is it, honey?

554
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:57,821
The danger of Emily-world is that
you don't always know you're in it...

555
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:02,117
- when actually you are.
- Not this Emily-world stuff again.

556
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:05,329
Have you run the numbers on any of this?
What is this costing you?

557
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,333
I don't know the full cost, but your mother
is getting me 50% off of everything.

558
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,085
- She is so connected.
- But 50% off a load of money...

559
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,922
is still half a load of money.
You don't have that to spend.

560
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:18,509
- If I scrimp, I can afford a quarter load.
- That's still too much.

561
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:23,180
- Your mother said she'd chip in a little.
- That is way inappropriate.

562
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,350
I didn't take her up on it, but it was nice.

563
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,730
This isn't you: The midgets, mushrooms,
and God knows what else.

564
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,526
- And it isn't Jackson either.
- What do you mean?

565
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,569
- We talked.
- You and Jackson talked?

566
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:41,573
I'm sorry, but he came to me all upset.
And I love both of you...

567
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,576
and it just seemed like it was time
for me to meddle.

568
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,120
- He was upset?
- He was pretty upset.

569
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:50,749
- Why didn't he just talk to me?
- Because he's Jackson.

570
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,961
He wants you to be happy
and to give you everything you want.

571
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:57,422
So what it comes down to is,
is this what you want?

572
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,012
Maybe the midgets are a little over the top
and the mushrooms...

573
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,477
Oh, my God. It's all sounding so silly now.

574
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:14,273
- You're coming out of it. Keep going.
- No, it's not what I want.

575
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:18,485
We were supposed to keep this nice
and simple. God, we had it all worked out.

576
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,696
- So go back.
- I will go back.

577
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:25,075
- That is if Jackson still wants to marry me.
- Of course he still wants to.

578
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:27,828
I'm gonna call him and tell him
it's all changing back.

579
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,121
Good.

580
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:32,749
I should call and cancel some stuff first.
I've got to call Belgium, Oslo...

581
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,919
- Copenhagen, Bora Bora.
- What did you order from there?

582
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:39,423
- I'm gonna shield you from that one.
- Thanks.

583
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,344
Slow down.

584
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,724
Okay, I'll come right over. I got to go.

585
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:54,479
- Call and... Welcome back, friend.
- Thanks.

586
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:58,525
I'm gonna start with Hong Kong.
Hope those acrobats can get another gig.

587
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,571
- There you are.
- It won't close.

588
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,615
- What?
- The lid.

589
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,577
Hello, Louie.

590
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,121
- That's Louie.
- Nice tan.

591
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:14,625
- Now you say the lid won't close?
- Yes.

592
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,377
- Did you buy the right size?
- Of course.

593
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:20,589
It's the model we recommend for those
of medium height and weight.

594
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,592
- And he's of medium height and weight.
- Why won't it close?

595
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:27,971
Because of the stuff. He left a list of stuff
he wanted buried with him.

596
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,724
- It's not uncommon.
- It's a very long list.

597
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:34,269
Fishing reel, bowling trophy, a flask,
his antique dueling pistols...

598
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:36,230
his copy of Sherman's memoirs.

599
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,607
- Is all the stuff in there now?
- Yes, it is.

600
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,235
I shoved it in the best I could,
but it won't close...

601
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:45,280
which defeats the purpose of having
a damn casket in the first place.

602
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:47,282
- May I?
- Give it a shot.

603
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:57,668
The football signed by Johnny Unitas
gives it that bounce.

604
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:02,339
What if we move the gas mask
and pith helmet down towards the feet?

605
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:06,218
That end already has every baseball card
he ever bought, thousands of them.

606
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,512
Bungee cord. No.

607
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:12,057
What if we got some people
from the office here...

608
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:16,854
to sit on the lid and we could latch it?
Do you have anybody you could spring?

609
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,856
- I'm out of ideas.
- So am I.

610
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:21,733
You know what? To hell with this.

611
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:24,862
- I can't deal with this anymore.
- It has to be dealt with.

612
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:28,574
It doesn't. It's not as if he deserves
my help or my respect.

613
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,576
- The man was your uncle.
- He was a jerk!

614
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,287
- Don't say that.
- Taylor and the guys were right.

615
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,873
I was cutting Louie slack out of respect
for my dad...

616
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:39,501
but the man was rotten and mean
and selfish all his life.

617
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:41,420
He's even selfish in death.

618
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:44,256
Other people would have loved
to have those baseball cards.

619
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,466
I would have loved to had those cards.

620
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,804
He's got Lou Gehrig's rookie card,
Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, tons of others.

621
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:55,392
But, no. My uncle, King Tut, has to take all
of them to the afterlife with him.

622
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:58,061
- Sir, your voice.
- I'm done. I've had it.

623
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:02,399
From now on, it's just the bare minimum
and that's it.

624
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,277
Dig a big hole and just dump
the casket in unlatched.

625
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:10,073
If stuff falls out, fine. Pile on enough dirt
and make sure nothing's showing.

626
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:15,078
I'm assuming that wouldn't
be appropriate, either.

627
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,039
- No.
- I didn't think so.

628
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:26,048
Young man, where's the young lady
we heard so much about...

629
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:29,843
who's using those delightful old diner
phrases to place people's orders?

630
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:32,846
It sounds so fun.
Could you point her out for us?

631
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,931
No.

632
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,017
That's to everyone. I'll be upstairs.

633
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,728
Thanks for doing the very least
you could possibly do.

634
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:40,812
You're welcome.

635
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:44,316
- There you are. I was worried.
- Sorry, I should have called.

636
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,361
Thanks for covering again.
This'll be the last time. I promise.

637
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,154
It's okay. Where were you?

638
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:52,783
First, I walked around a bunch
trying to clear my head.

639
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:56,161
- Saw a lot of Hartford. What a cesspool.
- You're not a city man.

640
00:33:56,203 --> 00:34:00,290
I calmed down and figured
dumping Louie's body in an open grave...

641
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,835
with all his stuff probably
would be a little cold.

642
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:03,961
A tad.

643
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,714
I got a yellow pages and found
a big-and-tall casket shop in Hartford.

644
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:08,882
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

645
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:12,386
I found a casket for my 160-pound uncle
and his 140 pounds of stuff.

646
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:16,348
Got the lid to shut the first time we tried.
So the funeraI's on as scheduled.

647
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,184
- Good.
- I don't know why I'm doing this.

648
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:22,104
- For your dad.
- I guess, although he's dead...

649
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,523
so he'd never know
if I was doing it any different.

650
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:25,649
He knows.

651
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:30,529
He's got the big Luke picture screen on
24 hours a day, he watches and smiles.

652
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,240
And you're doing it 'cause you're you.

653
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:36,660
I'm gonna change, then you can retire
from your diner career forever.

654
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:39,163
No, it's fun.
I came up with some new diner phrases.

655
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,331
- You know what a 'lucky duck cluck' is?
- No.

656
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:44,376
It's foie gras with chicken
and green shamrock frosting.

657
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:47,504
- Why would anyone order that?
- If they're high.

658
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,756
- Good grief.
- What?

659
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,176
Bad vibe sandwich just came in.
You better retreat.

660
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,844
I won't be long.

661
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:57,306
- Hi, Mom.
- Since when do you work here?

662
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:59,349
I'm just lending a hand. What's going on?

663
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,810
I went by the inn to work with Sookie
on her wedding.

664
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:02,895
Yeah?

665
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:05,105
- And she fired me.
- She didn't fire you.

666
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:07,691
She's changed her mind
on all the things we planned.

667
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,401
- Maybe she did.
- No, she didn't.

668
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,987
I know what's behind this.
That is, who's behind this.

669
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,073
It was getting to be too much
for her and her fianc�.

670
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:17,576
- I knew it.
- These are not wealthy people.

671
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:20,579
Do you understand that?
They're saving for a home...

672
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:24,082
and your midgets were dancing
between them and their dreams.

673
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:27,127
- You say 'midgets' like it's so absurd.
- Do you hear yourself?

674
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:30,506
I don't see what was wrong
with my helping Sookie plan her wedding.

675
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,049
- Mom, come on.
- What?

676
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,427
- You weren't planning Sookie's wedding.
- Whose wedding was I planning?

677
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:37,846
- Mine.
- Don't be ridiculous.

678
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,849
Your vision for this wedding
and all the over-the-top stuff...

679
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:45,395
like flowers, bunting, champagne fountain,
and the haute-couture dress.

680
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:49,441
Who's wearing that wedding dress
in your mind's eye, Mom? Sookie? Or me?

681
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:53,028
- I wasn't planning your wedding, Lorelai.
- Right.

682
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,364
The wedding I was planning
was for Sookie.

683
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:59,076
The mushrooms and colors,
they all seemed like fun, a little crazy...

684
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,912
just like she is.
It definitely was not for you.

685
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,873
I know that you'd never let me plan
your wedding.

686
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:07,668
I gave up on that dream a long time ago.

687
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:11,380
Yours was going to be a Russian
winter theme, the Romanovs.

688
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:14,800
- Before the firing squad, I assume?
- Snow-white roses...

689
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:18,387
trees with white lights and candles.
Snow everywhere.

690
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,640
You arriving in a silver sleigh
with white horses.

691
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:25,644
- You hate the idea.
- No, I just...

692
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:30,774
- It just doesn't seem like me.
- It would have been beautiful.

693
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,860
I'm sure it would have been.

694
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:35,779
It's obvious that wouldn't
be appropriate anymore...

695
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:38,657
being as I'm probably standing
in your reception hall.

696
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,368
- Excuse me?
- Burgers and fries for the dinner...

697
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:44,663
the bride walks down the aisle
with a ketchup dispenser in her hand.

698
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:48,041
- Tell me what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Luke.

699
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:52,212
- It's obvious, Lorelai.
- No, it's not, Mom.

700
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,464
- You're with him constantly.
- He feeds me.

701
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,593
- You bring up his name constantly.
- Once again, he feeds me.

702
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:01,388
- The moment he calls, you run to his side.
- He's my friend. He needed me.

703
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,974
- I had to be there.
- I know you did.

704
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,313
- Hi.
- Hello.

705
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:15,319
I have to go. I'll see you for dinner tonight.

706
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:18,614
And Luke, I'm sure I'll see you again soon.

707
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:28,957
- What do you think of the Romanovs?
- They probably had it coming.

708
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,918
A match made in heaven.

709
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:39,343
We're here to honor Louie,
to pay our respects...

710
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,929
and to bid him a sorrowful goodbye.

711
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:43,889
- You okay?
- Yeah.

712
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:47,059
- I'm not big on funerals in general.
- Nobody is.

713
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:51,438
He passed away in his sleep,
so the end came peacefully for Louie...

714
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:54,233
which I'm sure is a great comfort
to all who knew him.

715
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:57,402
The passing-away part
was a great comfort for all who knew him.

716
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,404
- I didn't know him.
- Good thing.

717
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:03,492
But I understand he was a fine man,
destined to be missed by many.

718
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:06,995
- Especially the ones that were suing him.
- Stop. Sorry, Father.

719
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,997
- Reverend.
- Right.

720
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:13,710
Now let us witness Louie Danes
as he is interred and brought to the Lord.

721
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:23,178
It was a nice and intimate service.

722
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:26,890
I guess everybody deserves something
at the end.

723
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,853
- Thanks for coming.
- I wouldn't have missed it.

724
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:35,482
That ain't me, is it?

725
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:38,277
What are you talking about?

726
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,404
What Taylor said about me
being like Louie:

727
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:44,741
A loner, never being married and stuff?
I'm getting crankier as I get older.

728
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:47,786
- He's not so far off.
- You are not your uncle.

729
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:54,501
Would Louie ever build someone
a huppah or help fix things around...

730
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:58,422
someone's house without being asked,
or make a special coffee cake...

731
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:01,800
- with balloons for a girI's 16th birthday?
- Rory told you about that?

732
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:06,471
Yes. Would Louie have taken in his sister's
kid without asking for anything in return?

733
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,557
No one would've trusted Louie
with their kid.

734
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,976
He probably would have forgotten
to feed him.

735
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,104
- You get my point.
- Yeah, I get it.

736
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:20,402
What's that?

737
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:28,327
- Is that Andrew?
- I believe it is.

738
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,788
Left, right, left.

739
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,624
That's all of them.

740
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,048
Company halt.

741
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,300
Company salute!

742
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:48,222
Thanks.

743
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:52,142
- It's what your dad wanted.
- Yeah.

744
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:57,523
And Louie would have hated this.

745
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,526
That's just a fringe benefit.

746
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,486
Present arms!

747
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:20,295
Do you think he's in heaven?

748
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:23,507
I hope so, just so my dad
can kick his butt around the place.

749
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,426
- Can you kick in heaven?
- It's probably frowned upon.

750
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,720
Yeah, plus you're
all see-through and gauzy.

751
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:32,724
- Dad's foot could go right through him.
- This is a silly conversation.

752
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:35,269
- What's all this?
- I have no idea.

753
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:44,695
- What's going on?
- It's kind of like a wake for Louie.

754
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,281
- I thought you set it up.
- I didn't set it up.

755
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:51,160
It's going well. People brought a ton
of food, if you guys are hungry.

756
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:53,203
- This is unexpected.
- Very.

757
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:56,540
- Don't you have wakes for people you like?
- Think it might be for you.

758
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:58,500
- Am I dead?
- Face it. People like you.

759
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:01,628
- Shut up.
- How can they resist charm like that?

760
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:06,842
Hey, Taylor. Cool threads.
Very 'One if by land. '

761
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:11,388
- I see you're digging into the vegetables.
- Thanks for the play-by-play.

762
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,265
Brought those myself.

763
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:15,684
How was the funeral?

764
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:19,062
Shouldn't you be tending
to your little stand out there, friend?

765
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,064
- The stand's gone.
- What?

766
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:24,902
- I'm all packed up. I'm out of here.
- I don't get it.

767
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:28,614
I grow this stuff in my backyard,
and as of yesterday, sold it all.

768
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,282
- You sold it all?
- Sold it all.

769
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:33,368
Made enough money to do some traveling.
Have you been to Israel?

770
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:37,289
Turbulent, but I thought I'd go down
and try and plant some peace down there.

771
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:40,667
- See if it grows, see if it spreads.
- Shut up.

772
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:43,795
Why did you put me through
all that hoo-ha at the town meeting...

773
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:46,298
if your vegetable business
was just temporary?

774
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:49,843
You put yourself through it, Taylor.

775
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:56,225
- Nice spread.
- People have too much free time here.

776
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:57,643
You did a good thing.

777
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:01,522
- I thought my mom set this up. She didn't.
- So? It wasn't me.

778
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:03,565
- It wasn't?
- No, no way.

779
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:06,944
- It wasn't me.
- If you say so.

780
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:10,697
The crazy ballet teacher asked when Luke
was getting back from the funeral...

781
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:14,326
if I could unlock the door.
I did and went back to sleep.

782
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:17,579
- So you did do a little something.
- I unlocked the door.

783
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:20,290
So people could come in here
and put this together. Nice.

784
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:22,501
- Nice for them, not for me.
- You facilitated it.

785
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:25,504
You made it happen.
So you're officially part of our town now.

786
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:26,713
- Wait a minute.
- Welcome.

787
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,215
I'm not part of this town.

788
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:31,009
See you for some tree planting
at the Arbor Day festival.

789
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:34,388
Maybe I can knock over a liquor store
while everyone's planting trees.

790
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:36,473
As long as it's a liquor store in town.

791
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:41,061
It's Halloween, and we're lucky Louie
doesn't have razor wire around his yard.

792
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:46,650
Finally, one of the kids gets courageous
and goes sauntering up to the door.

793
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:48,193
He goes, 'Trick or treat!'

794
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:52,781
Louie throws the door open and says,
'Did you get a Reese's cup tonight?'

795
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:55,534
The kid looks in his bag and says,
'Yes, sir, I did. '

796
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:59,663
Louie grabs it, says 'Thank you,'
and slams the door in his face.

797
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:04,209
- I'm sorry I never met him.
- He was colorful.

798
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:06,044
I never trick-or-treated again.

799
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:10,382
One day I'm at the post office in line
when Louie just about knocks me over.

800
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:13,218
He cuts in line.
I said, 'Louie, there's a line! '

801
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,763
He says, 'Kiss my butt. '
I said, 'You mind your manners. '

802
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:21,059
He says, 'Please kiss my butt,'
and drops his pants.

803
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:27,065
I got one. Louie was parked outside
Al's Pancake World...

804
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,485
and I was trying to pull
in the space behind him.

805
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:32,821
All of a sudden, he starts to back up.
I honked my horn...

806
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:12,903
English
