1
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:06,496
Morning, Al. Morning, Fred. Morning, Sam.

2
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:09,533
Cider Mill's opening Saturday. Big parade and free cider for one and all.

3
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:10,203
Thank you.

4
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,331
Cider mill's opening Saturday. Big parade and free cider for one and all.

5
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:17,683
- Thank you.
- Keep it going, kids. You're red, you're delicious.

6
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:22,799
You're about to have the juice sucked out of you. There she is - our spunky entrepreneur.

7
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,737
I am the uber-Trump-Murdoch-Maximus. Oop. Apple down.

8
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:31,380
Apple down. Apple down! Hold it, everybody! Apple down! Okay, roll her over. Have a nice day.

9
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:34,887
Big parade, free cider for one and all.

10
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:32,436
…and two eggs over easy, got it. Just be a couple minutes. Caesar, order.

11
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:36,097
Since they were both actually royalty, their child would have a real claim to the Judean throne, see?

12
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:39,668
So Mary Magdalene goes to Gaul to have the kid. She's also supposed to run the church after his death,

13
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:43,374
but that's not what Peter wants, right? But all that got covered up later by Constantine

14
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:48,513
- after the council of Nicea purged the Christian...
- Oh, my god! Will you stop talking about this!

15
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,918
- This is, like, the number-one book in the country.
- Well, it's my number-one bummer.

16
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:53,618
Okay, guys, what'll you have?

17
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:57,090
Burger for me - nothing healthy on it, extra cheese - and, of course,

18
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,840
an order of... wink-winkers.

19
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:02,808
- You don't have to call them that, Zach.
- Just want to make myself clear.

20
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,802
Look, I told you guys I'd throw you free fries - not a big deal

21
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:08,891
since they're usually the ones we wind up throwing out anyway from making too many,

22
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:12,373
which means you don't have to call them wink-winkers or nudge-nudgies

23
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:15,854
or know-what-I-meanies or anything else in verbal code, especially if it's cute-cutesy.

24
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,206
I will abide by that.

25
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:20,293
- Brian?
- Same thing - burger and fries.

26
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:24,292
- Dude, that's cute-cutesy.
- She said not to be verbally cute-cutesy.

27
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:27,687
It was a blanket moratorium on anything cutesy concerning the fries.

28
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:28,638
I'll be back.

29
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,092
- Cokes, too.
- Better get my money ready.

30
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,217
That's not embarrassing.

31
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:35,798
Hi, Lane.

32
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:38,337
Lorelai, hi. Would you like your usual to go?

33
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:39,663
Yes, and quick-quick, please.

34
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,690
You know, people are calling you "the blur. "

35
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,641
That's mean. Or is it? What is that?

36
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:46,354
You're not around, and you're always running - swoosh, blur.

37
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,914
Well, that's business, baby. If you slow down, they might catch up with you.

38
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:53,435
- Still no Luke, huh?
- Liz and T.J. are still not back up on their feet.

39
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:56,702
Luke's calling the Renaissance Faire his "Vietnam without all the fun shooting. "

40
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:57,951
Oh, poor guy.

41
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:01,914
I made it extra strong. It should blacken your teeth and rot your stomach.

42
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:02,661
Bless you.

43
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,517
- All from Rory.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Just being nosey.

44
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:16,184
No, go ahead, read. I'm sure it's stuff she already told you.

45
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,814
- Yeah, probably.
- You are ready to swoosh.

46
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:22,625
- The blur is off.
- And don't overtip.

47
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:28,008
- Try and stop me. Hey, guys.
- Hey, Lorelai. Get yourself a wink-winker?

48
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,377
- What?
- Please erase this from your brain.

49
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:31,569
I will definitely try.

50
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:40,263
I'm telling you, I was going crazy. I was in pain for six weeks.

51
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,863
It was fractured in three places. That's why it took so long to heal.

52
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:46,996
But thank God for my big brother.

53
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,031
- Morning, Lucas.
- Hey, Henry. How's your beard?

54
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:54,758
- You always ask that, and I always laugh.
- Well, it's our thing.

55
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:56,477
Hey, come here. Got some dish.

56
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:59,622
You know Hay Bale Bill, the guy that totes the hay bales?

57
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:00,534
I seen him around.

58
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:03,354
Got caught in a tent last night with Annie from the grog booth.

59
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,265
Hm. Isn't she engaged to the fruit-ice guy?

60
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:08,455
Yeah, and the fruit-ice guy comes back, and there's Annie and Hay Bale,

61
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:10,656
so he tears the tent to pieces.

62
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:14,118
Now the grog people have to hide her. They set up a fort made out of kegs.

63
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:15,925
- Crazy stuff.
- I'll keep you posted.

64
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,944
All right. See you later.

65
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:22,292
- Luuuuuuuke?
- What, T.J.?

66
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:26,021
- You're putting the pewter next to the turquoise?
- Looks like it.

67
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:30,215
- We don't usually put the pewter next to the turquoise.
- Well, I'm a maverick.

68
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,188
Mm-hmm.

69
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,877
Ahh.

70
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,243
- Might be why the pewter ain't moving.
- Pewter's moving just fine, T.J.

71
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,317
- Excuse me?
- Oh, hi, there.

72
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,211
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. I'm looking for the Shakespeare stage.

73
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:53,425
Okay, you walk past the Calumba booth, veer right at the drinking horns, then left at the antler ark.

74
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:54,718
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,084
- Luuuuuke?
- What, T.J.?

76
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:03,874
You didn't use the approved Faire language with that customer.

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,095
Maverick - me. Don't forget that.

78
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:10,003
There's undercover Faire officials walking around. They look for that kind of stuff.

79
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:13,402
- Well, they should get real jobs.
- Would it kill you to shoot her a "Good-morrow"?

80
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:14,765
Look, T.J....

81
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:18,401
- I don't believe it.
- I know.

82
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,154
The Yanks went with Mussina. They should have gone with Brown.

83
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:23,945
- You're watching T.V.!
- I'm not ready for my nap.

84
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:25,870
- You're milking it.
- I'm convalescing.

85
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:27,641
And you're milking me. But no more.

86
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:31,005
Find some help, get a crutch, because by week's end, I'm gone.

87
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:33,294
- Liz, you hearing this?
- What?

88
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,306
I'm sorry. I was listening to my Deepak Chopra.

89
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,923
I got things to do. I got a business, hopefully a life.

90
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:41,753
Uh, prithee, you jest, good sir, and leave us short of hand?

91
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,687
- I ain't jesting.
- But my arm!

92
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:46,990
Had no trouble reaching into a tub of caramel corn last night

93
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,779
while you were scratching yourself with the other. Your dexterity's fine.

94
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:54,527
- T.J., It's time for him to go.
- So, you're gonna break up the team?

95
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,025
I'm no good to you. I'm not moving the pewter.

96
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:02,944
Don't want you to get in trouble with the undercover squad.

97
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,080
Hallo, and here we are - room 518.

98
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,917
A beautiful room - very special for you, Mrs. Gilmore.

99
00:07:13,972 --> 00:07:15,549
- It's nice.
- It's hot.

100
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:18,366
I will adjust the air for you. No problem on my end.

101
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:22,308
It's a spectacular view. Very nice. A little balcony there.

102
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:24,453
- It's different.
- Something is different?

103
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,522
The view - it's different.

104
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:29,988
- Wow. It's pretty spectacular.
- It's not the same.

105
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,897
It's the same room you had two years ago, Signora - 518.

106
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:34,908
The ruins - they used to be closer. Something move?

107
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:35,872
I don't think so.

108
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:37,756
That pillar is in a different place.

109
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:41,550
I think the ruins are probably where they've been for the past 2,000 years, Grandma.

110
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,515
We can get you another room, signora. No problem.

111
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:44,883
No, no, it's fine.

112
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,967
- Smokers.
- I despise smokers.

113
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,667
Rory, I told you before, you do not move luggage.

114
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:55,912
- Yes, yes, please. We will do that.
- Sorry.

115
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:58,220
- Your high tea is still at the same time?
- Si, signora.

116
00:07:58,282 --> 00:08:01,429
We'll need to book some private tours - the Vatican, the Villa Medici.

117
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,392
And private - just the two of us.

118
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:06,756
The concierge in Florence stuck us with a Belgian couple at the Uffizi

119
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:08,754
who didn't know a fresco from a ferret hole.

120
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:13,176
And the ruins, of course. Make sure the guide's not too dry. So different.

121
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,950
The hanging bags should be hung, not laid on the bed.

122
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:20,063
Excuse me. How far away are we from the catacombs?

123
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,610
Close, but your grandmother would not like the catacombs. Bones disturb her.

124
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:28,378
It's for me. My grandmother usually takes a nap this time of day, so I go off and do my own thing.

125
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,231
Ah, yes, a nap.

126
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:32,315
We need two more pillows.

127
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:35,526
I will see to it. Anything else I can do?

128
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,251
That should do it. Thank you, Luciano.

129
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,387
Yeah, thank you very much.

130
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:41,137
Grazie mille. Buona notte. Good evening. Thank you.

131
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:43,790
Let's sit down and pick our restaurants.

132
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:47,614
That's three nights - that's three lunches and three dinners.

133
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,951
We'll take our usual passeggiata around the piazza navana, but let's pick the restaurants.

134
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:54,250
Do you want to pick them before your nap or after?

135
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:57,046
- I'm skipping my nap today.
- Oh, really?

136
00:08:57,172 --> 00:09:00,547
- Absolutely. I'm not the least bit tired.
- Oh, good.

137
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:03,532
Couldn't hide it any better than that, huh?

138
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:04,613
Hide what?

139
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:06,973
I don't take my nap, you don't get to go out on your own.

140
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,886
Oh... Grandma, I wasn't thinking that.

141
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,800
Well, I was kidding. I'm exhausted.

142
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:15,389
I'm not sure I'll even make it to the bedroom. I may just drop down here on the carpet.

143
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:19,778
Thank you, Grandma. It's all cultural stuff, I promise. Just kind of faster and funkier.

144
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,979
- Well, go enjoy your funk.
- Thank you.

145
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,526
Say, when was the last time we called your mother?

146
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:28,078
Not sure.

147
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:30,226
- Have we called her this week?
- I think you did.

148
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:32,634
- We'll call when you come back.
- Okay. Bye.

149
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:33,418
Bye-bye.

150
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:39,173
Morning.

151
00:09:39,321 --> 00:09:40,611
- Morning.
- Morning.

152
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:44,944
Oh hey Rob, I want to keep these brochures nice and neat in the rack here, none of them askew.

153
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:47,631
Otherwise, it gives the place that "we'll leave the light on for you" feel

154
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:49,746
- that we're desperately trying to avoid.
- Yeah, I checked it.

155
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:55,695
That is, if we ultimately decide that we don't mind having brochures here in the lobby.

156
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:57,381
The jury's still out on that.

157
00:09:57,815 --> 00:10:02,541
You know what? Jury's back. Brochures are out. I'll just take this in the office and...

158
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:05,284
- Michel...
- Good morning.

159
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,343
- Um, what are you doing?
- Hiding.

160
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:08,449
- From me?
- No.

161
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:09,115
From?

162
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:13,758
Suffice to say, my hiding is not costing the inn any income. In fact, I'm overdue for my 10.

163
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:17,363
So consider this my 10, and you are now conducting business with an employee

164
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:20,465
who is officially on his 10, which is in direct violation of union rules.

165
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:23,445
- You're not in a union.
- I'm in a union of oppressed Frenchmen.

166
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:26,703
Oh, the U.O.F. - Got it. All right. Carry on.

167
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:32,477
Oh, hey, there is a spot on the floor over here that the vacuum never quite reaches.

168
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,013
Let's make sure it does. Thank you.

169
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,481
- Hi. It's the Krumholtzes. How are you doing today?
- Great. Are you always here?

170
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:41,509
I give that illusion. So, what's on the agenda today?

171
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:45,008
- Mike and I would love to hit some antique stores.
- We can guide you to the best of them.

172
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:49,492
But the kids would love to stay here. You got games and books, and they'd be bored stiff with us.

173
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,627
They can absolutely stay here. There's always people around.

174
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:53,633
- Is Michel going to be here?
- Yes.

175
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,196
Oh, good. He is their favorite.

176
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:57,996
Michel? Have they met Michel? Have you met Michel?

177
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,707
- He's funny!
- Yeah!

178
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:02,256
They love him. He chases them around and shouts

179
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:05,133
and pretends to be mad, and they laugh and laugh.

180
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:09,736
Well, Michel is here, and I'm sure he would be happy to look after you guys

181
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:12,921
while your parents are gone. In fact, he's playing hide-and-seek right now,

182
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:17,647
and if you go over to the reception area, I guarantee you'll be getting warm, warmer, hot.

183
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,966
Goodie! Let's go! Come on!

184
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:21,089
Have a good day.

185
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:24,464
Morning! Who needs coffee?

186
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,770
Oh, I'll get you some coffee right there.

187
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:31,911
Oh, hey, when Sookie gets in, tell her I want to go over the layout for the dinner menu.

188
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:34,302
I want to go another way. I'll be in my office. Thank you.

189
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,963
Hey, you found him. Good job, Krumholtzes.

190
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:44,288
He grounded us and told us to go do something to ourselves.

191
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:47,917
- He used a dirty word.
- And I'm destined to use many more.

192
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:52,519
- No, you're not. Come here.
- It is not my job to entertain little people.

193
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:54,997
Michel, the Krumholtzes are in our most expensive room.

194
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:58,679
We need people like them to be happy so they tell other people like them they we're happy

195
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:01,474
because we are a new business, and we all have to go above

196
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:04,139
and beyond the call of duty until we are established.

197
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:06,170
- So you watch them.
- I hate kids.

198
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:09,069
- This isn't fair.
- You're a profit participant.

199
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:12,262
Happy Krumholtzes equal lots of profits, participant.

200
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:17,843
Who wants to play some insipid board game with me?

201
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,702
We want to play an insipid board game!

202
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:22,369
Yeah! Let's play Chinese checkers!

203
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,879
- Hello?
- Lorelai, it's your mother!

204
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:25,467
- Hi, Mom.
- I'm calling from Rome!

205
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,628
The line is crystal clear. You don't have to yell.

206
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:30,865
Sorry - I still think transcontinental calls are a bigger deal than they are.

207
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,453
- You're coming in fine. So, Rome?
- Our last stop, and a good thing, too,

208
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:37,571
because I don't know how long I can keep these randy European men off me.

209
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:40,044
- Excuse me?
- They're terrible flirts here.

210
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:42,779
Gorgeous, but so forward. Do you want to talk to Rory?

211
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:45,457
Oh, um, sure. Is she there?

212
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:47,694
Yes, she is. Hang on. Rory!

213
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:51,636
Hello?

214
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,296
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,491
- So, Rome?
- Yep.

216
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,826
- Weather good?
- Hot in the day, cooler at night.

217
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,763
Uh-huh, that's kind of what we're having here.

218
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:05,962
- Coinky-dink.
- Yeah.

219
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,405
- So...
- So...

220
00:13:09,464 --> 00:13:11,589
Um, I guess I'll be seeing you in a couple of days.

221
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:12,679
Yep.

222
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:17,662
Great, then. Be safe, and watch out for those Italian men, especially the ones named Randy.

223
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,099
- I will. Bye.
- Bye.

224
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:27,902
Didn't look like a quarter would bounce off it. Got to have those bouncing quarters.

225
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:34,578
I think the pink purse with the gold clasp is my favorite.

226
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,825
We probably could have gotten all this stuff at home, Grandma.

227
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:39,155
Now we have to pay duty on them.

228
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:42,277
But if you buy them back in the States, then you can't say, "I picked this up in Rome. "

229
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,613
Buon giorno. Hello. May I help you, please?

230
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,540
Buon giorno.

231
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:52,068
Ah, la bellissima signora parlo italiano molto bene.

232
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:55,734
Grazie. He called me "pretty lady. " It just never stops.

233
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,035
You got the gams, Grandma.

234
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:07,515
Rory? Rory?

235
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,887
What do you want?

236
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:11,417
Oh. A triple espresso.

237
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,122
Si, signora.

238
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,104
He won't stop.

239
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:32,947
The fact is, we've got five original songs ready to play live.

240
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:36,075
A 40-minute gig means we can fill it out with six or seven covers.

241
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:37,390
- No problem.
- Problem.

242
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:39,116
Our covers are tight and people dig 'em.

243
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,671
We play "Fell in Love With a Girl" as good as the White Stripes,

244
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,078
so how is one of our originals gonna stack up coming after it?

245
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,304
We could play all our originals up top, then close with our covers.

246
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:49,987
That's asymmetrical, and we could lose our audience if we play a bunch of originals in a row.

247
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:51,476
Our covers are just too good.

248
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,086
I say we cut any cover song that overpowers our originals.

249
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,454
So no "Suffragette City. "

250
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:59,372
And no White Stripes. "Lithium" is gone, the Radiohead, both Pixies.

251
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,230
- No Dandy Warhols.
- Or Velvet Underground.

252
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:04,102
Wait, guys. You're cutting every good cover song we play.

253
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,689
But maybe that's the key.

254
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,857
Yeah, yeah - if we play nothing but crappy covers, our originals will stand out.

255
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,035
- Brilliant.
- What?!

256
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:13,784
- Anything by Men At Work.
- Or Chicago, Wings.

257
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,998
- Styx.
- Culture Club.

258
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,546
We throw in a Quarterflash, they'll be eating out of our hands.

259
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:21,740
Okay, this is just kooky. Now, I say we reconvene tonight and figure it out then.

260
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,905
- I got to get to work, anyway.
- I'll see you at home tonight.

261
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:26,426
I'll get you some more water?

262
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:31,137
- Well, hello.
- Hey, there.

263
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,358
- Hi, Zach.
- Trina, how you doing?

264
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,611
Cheryl, come on. Shoot me some.

265
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:39,808
Come this way. You sit there.

266
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,294
- It's your turn.
- Really?

267
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:53,588
That fact has not changed since you said it 10 seconds ago?

268
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,853
If you lose, will you do that thing where you pretend to get all mad

269
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:01,007
and you hit the board and send the marbles flying all around?

270
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:03,253
- Yeah!
- I am not going to lose.

271
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,558
Hi, kids. Michel, do we have any double-A batteries?

272
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:08,108
How can a man play Chinese Checkers with all these interruptions?

273
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,417
Ugh! Man, they're still not vacuuming that spot.

274
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:13,638
- It's your turn, Michel.
- Redundant little rodent.

275
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,560
- Michel, the batteries?
- In the office - far-right drawer of the credenza. Damn!

276
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:21,779
Is where water is stored to power electrical facilities. Thanks Michel.

277
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,141
It's your turn again.

278
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:25,879
Why are the dining room tables always, always out of place?

279
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,324
Lorelai? Excuse me.

280
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:36,269
Okay, okay. Table's perfect now.

281
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,310
Who keeps moving them out of place? I want a name.

282
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:42,813
Uh, cruel, sadistic table fairies? Come into the pantry with me, here.

283
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,569
I can give you a minute. That's it. - Ooh.

284
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:48,710
I've been trying to figure out a way to bring this up - what's that?

285
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,830
- I cleared a plate.
- You don't clear plates.

286
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,381
- The plate was empty, so I grabbed it.
- Give me the plate.

287
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,233
- You've gone nutty!
- What?!

288
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,510
Now you're mad. I hate making you mad. I have the worst people skills.

289
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,374
- I'm not mad or nutty.
- But you are, and you have been for weeks.

290
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:04,578
The nutty don't usually know that they're nutty, thus the nutty.

291
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:05,566
Sookie, I'm very busy.

292
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:07,379
- Doing other people's work.
- I am not.

293
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:09,687
- It's your job to change sheets, fluff pillows?
- No.

294
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,193
Brush the horses, fold the points on the toilet paper?

295
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,464
Sookie, we're breaking in new people. I'm picking up the slack.

296
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,978
- I'm new? Michel's new?
- I'm not doing your jobs.

297
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,321
Two weeks ago, I come in, and my refrigerator, which is sorted by a system

298
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:24,044
that I have honed for 10 straight years, is completely rearranged.

299
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:27,229
The beets are on the top. The vegetables are on the bottom.

300
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:33,296
It's "Apocalypse Now," baby! I yelled at the staff, but now I know. It was you.

301
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:36,691
- It was messy.
- It was my messy.

302
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:39,947
I couldn't find anything in there for days. I kept reaching in for strawberries

303
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:44,330
- and coming up with liver - that's not pleasant.
- I promise not to touch the fridge again.

304
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:47,299
- You're yelling at the employees. You never yelled before.
- I'm yelling?

305
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:51,408
- And you've got to go home once in a while.
- Sookie, we're a new business. It's time-consuming.

306
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:54,799
How many times have you fallen asleep at your desk in that stupid office of yours?

307
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,147
- Once.
- No.

308
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:58,790
Once, you fell asleep on a stapler. The whole next day,

309
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,724
you had "Swingline" printed backwards across your face.

310
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:03,729
But you've fallen asleep at that desk a hundred times.

311
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,608
Well, I'm here when I'm here. I can't change that. I'm sorry.

312
00:18:06,663 --> 00:18:10,288
Want to know the last time I saw staff and maids looking this scared of their boss?

313
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:11,497
Your mother's house.

314
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:13,893
Ow! Knife in the gut!

315
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:17,012
Well, I'm sorry to deal from the bottom of the deck, but that's reality.

316
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:20,914
Well... I am pretty burned out.

317
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:24,282
Me too. We all are. It's been hard.

318
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,641
- I will take a break.
- Good.

319
00:18:28,163 --> 00:18:32,638
Not this week, 'cause stuff's been piling up. But... not next week. God. I don't know.

320
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:36,922
- Now.
- Uh-oh. Hey, stop! Wait, I'm being kidnapped!

321
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:39,918
- Go home and relax.
- I have no one to hang out with.

322
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:42,652
I'll hang out with you sometime this week. I need a break, too.

323
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:46,697
We'll have a girlfriend day. We'll get manicures and jump rope and talk about boys.

324
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:50,050
The whole cliché thing. Now go! Go and don't stop for nothing.

325
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:51,070
Okay, okay, I promise.

326
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,444
Do it again! Do it again!

327
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:58,740
Hold it. Hold it! Good girl. Now, get your things and go.

328
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:13,198
Oh, hey. Um, Bob, are you sure you want to - nope. Keep going.

329
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:19,363
Hello?

330
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:21,140
- It's me.
- Oh. Hello.

331
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,856
- Bad time? Are you busy?
- Uh, trying not to be. How are you doing?

332
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:27,708
- Good. You?
- Good.

333
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:32,838
I was at the corner of Bark and Cheese today.

334
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:36,299
Bark and Cheese? Really?

335
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:39,977
- And it's exactly the same.
- Exactly the same?

336
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:44,366
Was there a tiny, little Italian dog in a basket barking the whole time you were there?

337
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:46,879
Not this time, but I definitely had flashbacks.

338
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,090
Did you have a nice piece of cheese with your coffee?

339
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:52,111
I still say I said the correct word for "cream" in Italian.

340
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:55,537
I even pointed at my coffee when I asked for it. How could I be asking for cheese?

341
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:57,652
- But cheese you were brought.
- Stinky cheese.

342
00:19:57,703 --> 00:20:00,012
- The worst, don't forget.
- That you proceeded to eat.

343
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:03,361
Because I hate people who make mistakes when they order, especially in a foreign country,

344
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:06,959
and then make a big to-do when they get the wrong thing. Ugly Americans. Yuck.

345
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:09,708
Aha! You admit it was a mistake. You did say "cheese. "

346
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,664
I know French, a bit of Spanish, but my Italian - not so good.

347
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:15,755
- Being trilingual is plenty for a young lady.
- Yeah.

348
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:17,994
- Mom?
- Yeah?

349
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:20,046
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:23,708
- It's okay.
- I screwed up.

351
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,018
I screwed up so bad. I handled everything wrong.

352
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,166
Oh, honey.

353
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,290
I keep reliving everything over and over. It's such a mess.

354
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:36,482
I just want to fix it. I have to fix it.

355
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,792
- You will.
- I know.

356
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,766
- I just - I need a favor.
- Okay.

357
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,821
- It's big.
- Okay.

358
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,127
I wrote a letter... to Dean.

359
00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:50,736
- Could you get it to him?
- Oh.

360
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,099
I don't know how else to do it. I can't just mail it to his apartment.

361
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:58,380
- It's a big favor.
- Honey, I don't know.

362
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:02,360
It's a lot to ask, but I think that this will make everything better. Please.

363
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,595
I can't wait until I get home. I have to do something now.

364
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,367
A letter, huh? Well, get it to me, and I will get it to him.

365
00:21:10,624 --> 00:21:12,697
Thank you. Thank you.

366
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,687
- Have some espresso and limburger for me.
- I will.

367
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,432
- I love you, mom.
- I love you, too.

368
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,548
- Bye.
- Bye.

369
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:28,896
- You know, I think if you made it a little fuller...
- Go!

370
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:29,783
Going.

371
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:39,177
I want to thank thee, kind lady, for your purchase. Please take one of my cards.

372
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:43,474
Note the website. And do enjoy your day at the Faire.

373
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:49,561
I am kickin' ass! Who knew I was a master salesman?

374
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,752
So, I'm all packed and ready to go.

375
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:55,495
Good, and don't worry about nothing, 'cause we're all cool here.

376
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:58,491
Well, that's the thing. In 10 years, I could die,

377
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:01,148
and they could very well trace it back to this moment.

378
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:04,593
"He got back up on his feet too fast. " That's what they can say.

379
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:08,613
It's weird when people who aren't doctors start thinking they're doctors.

380
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:11,249
- He'll be fine.
- Gosh, I was so worried.

381
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:14,716
So, I'm gonna make a phone call, and then I'll go.

382
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:21,454
Okay. Hey, hon, could you try and get this cash box open? It's stuck again.

383
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,236
If you want. It's just I was holding this screwdriver before, and I almost blacked out.

384
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,427
- I'll try again.
- Thanks.

385
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:39,493
Luuuke! Don't forget the undercover guys. They look for cell phones.

386
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:41,135
I'll keep an eye out.

387
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:44,526
Luuuuuuuke, I'm being your friend here.

388
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,283
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

389
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:55,288
- Well, huzzah and prithee. Art thou -?
- Stop.

390
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,962
- Sorry. How are you?
- Good.

391
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:59,830
Sorry, that was incomplete. How are you, you big, fat liar?

392
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,531
What?

393
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:04,309
- You said you would be home yesterday.
- I'm coming home today for sure.

394
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,602
"Oh, what's that, Lucy? A football for me to kick?"

395
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:07,868
I mean it this time.

396
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:11,231
Oh, whoa! Man! Whoo!

397
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,934
- It's a done deal.
- I'll believe it when I see it.

398
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,206
- Did I tell you about Bill?
- "Hay Bale Bill"? No. Spill.

399
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,285
He crawled in a tent with "Grog Booth Annie".

400
00:23:19,346 --> 00:23:20,600
- No way!
- He did.

401
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:23,305
- But she's engaged to the fruit-ice guy!
- It's not gonna last.

402
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:25,674
- Oh, boy.
- You feeling okay?

403
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:28,148
- I'm very nauseous.
- Not you, T.J.

404
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:30,996
I'm fine. I just have a little assignment I've got to do.

405
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:33,698
So, what lie are you gonna tell me about coming home now?

406
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:35,905
- I'm coming home today.
- So, next week?

407
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,739
Today.

408
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:41,301
Milady, dost thou have Pepto-Bismol on thee? Or breadstuffs?

409
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:43,442
- This month at least?
- Today.

410
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:46,535
- See you when Hillary's president.
- I'll see you later today.

411
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,287
Bye.

412
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:02,389
- Looking for something specific?
- Nah. Well...

413
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:05,080
- You remember those earrings you got me before?
- Yeah.

414
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:09,337
- You have a necklace that would match that?
- Yeah, I think so.

415
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,324
- You give them to a girl?
- Yeah.

416
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:15,042
- Anyone I know?
- Oh, you know, it's just someone.

417
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,591
Dark hair, bright, blue eyes? You were just talking to her?

418
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:19,702
I could tell, 'cause you grin a lot when you do.

419
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:22,912
- It's Lorelai.
- It's Lorelai! Huzzah!

420
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:24,632
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

421
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:29,752
- I never got the whole "huzzah" thing.
- I am so happy for you.

422
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,410
- You've found your T.J.
- Please don't put it like that.

423
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:36,751
I've had dreams about you two being together, and my dreams always come true.

424
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,810
Dream me a healthy spine, sweets.

425
00:24:38,913 --> 00:24:42,425
- You're not gonna be alone.
- Yeah, yeah. The necklace.

426
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,580
- Perfect?
- Perfect.

427
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:49,782
So, go give it to her.

428
00:24:56,249 --> 00:24:58,815
- Take care, Sis.
- I love you, big brother.

429
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:04,129
Whoa! One hug and my back would snap in eight pieces.

430
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,059
Good morrow, buddy.

431
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:16,709
Excuse me. I'm looking for Dean.

432
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:19,315
Thanks.

433
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:23,180
We get lots of stuff from Marco Farms, but a lot of the time,

434
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:26,471
it's hard to predict when it's gonna come in and how much of it we're gonna get.

435
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:30,359
We're kind of at the mercy of - of the um, guys -

436
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,477
of the farmers themselves, because they sell out a lot.

437
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:36,595
But why don't you leave your name and number when you check out,

438
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:39,243
and we'll give you a call as soon as the eggs you want come in, okay?

439
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:41,249
Dean.

440
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:42,360
- Hi.
- Hi.

441
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:46,462
- What's that?
- It's a letter for you from Rory.

442
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:49,138
- What happened? Where is she?
- Just take the letter.

443
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,431
She went to Europe, right? Miss Patty said she went to Europe.

444
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:55,284
What happened? What's she doing there? Who is she with?

445
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:56,348
- Dean.
- When's she getting back?

446
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,145
- Soon. Just take it.
- Where is she?

447
00:25:58,233 --> 00:25:59,295
- Europe.
- With who?

448
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:03,245
- Her grandmother. Look, take it.
- No. Why did she go? Whose idea was it?

449
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:04,463
- That doesn't matter.
- It does.

450
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:09,414
Dean, please. I'm a messenger, nothing more. Just take it.

451
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:26,526
Onion, guacamole, a little red pepper over butter lettuce and endive - it could be a big seller.

452
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:30,545
But, Caesar, it's not the salad. The salad looks delicious. It's what you're calling it.

453
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:31,615
Caesar's salad.

454
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:32,614
- Right.
- So?

455
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:35,188
There's already a Caesar salad. It's kind of famous.

456
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:37,543
That's Caesar salad. Mine's got an apostrophe "S."

457
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,504
I don't think that makes it less confusing.

458
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:41,798
- Customers.
- …greatest book I've ever read.

459
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:44,916
- Keep going, Zach.
- Yeah, this is da bomb.

460
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:47,887
So, Mary Magdalene goes to Gaul to have the kid.

461
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:50,074
That's the slutty one, right? Not the mom?

462
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,157
It's so confusing 'cause they're all named Mary.

463
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:54,363
She's not the mom, but she's not slutty.

464
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,384
That's what this dude Constantine wanted you to believe, right?

465
00:26:57,584 --> 00:27:00,897
He was purging the "E! True Hollywood Story" part of it for his own benefit.

466
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:05,140
Turned the whole thing into Hollywood Babylon, and chicks got the short end.

467
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:10,993
God, I just want to spend, like, three straight years doing nothing but reading, you know?

468
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,325
- What book?
- What?

469
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,409
- You're supposed to wait to be seated.
- Since when?

470
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:16,752
Since always. That's what what they do at Denny's.

471
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:21,161
Okay, well, my usual table where I always sit. Okay, Lane?

472
00:27:21,212 --> 00:27:24,111
- Fine Zach. What will you have?
- Allow me to order for you girls.

473
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:28,135
A ham sandwich for the lady on my right. Light mustard, right Trine?

474
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,439
- Is that a "yes", Trine?
- That's a "yes. "

475
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:33,214
Burger, no cheese for Cheryl. Cheeseburger for me,

476
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:35,775
and go ahead and shoot everybody here some fries

477
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:38,140
Free fries are for friends and family only. Sorry.

478
00:27:38,197 --> 00:27:40,532
- Another new rule?
- Nope - old. Old as Moses.

479
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:42,691
Okay, just bring me my order, and we'll all share.

480
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,028
- Sorry, no.
- What?

481
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,530
- You get free fries, you have to eat them.
- I can't share my own fries?

482
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,917
- That's right.
- That's bogus.

483
00:27:48,995 --> 00:27:52,354
That's tough, they're for you, not these girls. They're to be consumed by you, and you alone.

484
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,671
- I don't believe this.
- I'll be watching to see if you share, so don't get any big ideas.

485
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:58,261
Just forget about it, okay? We'll go to "Al's Pancake World".

486
00:27:58,308 --> 00:27:59,347
- Fine! Go!
- We are.

487
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:00,457
- Good.
- Come on, girls.

488
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:13,805
- Hey.
- What?

489
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:17,256
- Sorry. We didn't know.
- Know what?

490
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:24,174
Know what?

491
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:38,581
So... so, this is nice. Being away from the inn for a whole day.

492
00:28:38,643 --> 00:28:39,873
Get some perspective.

493
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,637
Just looking at something other than those same walls.

494
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,019
- What a relief.
- It all falls away.

495
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,782
My meat guy better not screw me like he did yesterday.

496
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:53,016
- Oh, my God! The gutters! That's what I forgot.
- I told Steve that if he doesn't leave by 3:00...

497
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:58,469
Hey, hey, did I tell Michel to have the guy check all the radiators or just the one - no, no, I did. I did.

498
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:02,416
- Ah, now it's falling away.
- It's starting to.

499
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:05,857
- I hate you, Dean! I hate everything!
- Let's just talk.

500
00:29:05,898 --> 00:29:09,067
- I don't want to talk! I don't want you here!
- I'm sorry, okay?

501
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:09,841
Sorry?

502
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:11,084
- Yes, because it'll never happen again.
- Oh, my God.

503
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,953
- Oh, my God.
- Don't! You've got my...

504
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:14,387
- Don't you dare!
- Can you not...

505
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:16,809
Well, that's what happens when you get married too young.

506
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:19,835
- I'm sorry. There's not much I can do but say I'm sorry.
- Yeah, that must be it.

507
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:22,420
There was a lot you could have done. And you know what? You didn't do it!

508
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:25,296
I usually only get to hear about these things. I never get to see them.

509
00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:27,341
I'm sorry. I mean, can we do something? Can we get over this?

510
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:29,267
- Too late! Look out the window!
- Yeah, lucky us. Come on.

511
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:31,293
- Let's just talk.
- I hate you Dean.

512
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:34,781
You definitely prepped the sauce for the duck? Because the duck without the sauce,

513
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,830
is a duck that we can't use. The sauce has to be prepped early.

514
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,911
I know you said it. Say it again.

515
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:43,418
Stop saying "let it go"! Stop saying "let it go," John.

516
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,597
Stop it. Stop it! I am letting it go.

517
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:51,860
I just need you to assure me that everything's getting done so that I know I can fully let it go.

518
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:52,542
Hello?

519
00:29:52,842 --> 00:29:56,135
- Kitchen!
- I am hanging up, but I am not letting it go!

520
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:58,589
- Mom!
- Oh, my traveler.

521
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:00,765
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

522
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:04,001
- Sookie!
- You remember who I am!

523
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:06,524
- Hello!
- Hi.

524
00:30:07,293 --> 00:30:09,765
Hello, Lorelai. Hello, Sookie.

525
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:11,026
- Hi, Emily.
- Hi, Mom.

526
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:13,641
- Don't! I smell like airplane.
- I guess I should go get my bags.

527
00:30:13,821 --> 00:30:17,988
- Rory, you do not touch bags.
- Oh, I thought that was just a Europe thing.

528
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:22,335
The driver's bringing them in. We had such a trip. Rory will fill you in.

529
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:24,050
Spare her the more salacious aspects.

530
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:25,198
Salacious aspects?

531
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:28,787
Those European men - young, old, in between - they saw us coming.

532
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:32,146
- They saw you coming where?
- We were like magnets. Such high libidos.

533
00:30:32,187 --> 00:30:35,477
You weren't wearing your "hot and wealthy" sandwich board, were you, Mom?

534
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,890
- She was very popular.
- Well, I should go.

535
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:42,974
I bring you back a charming, cultured, well-mannered young lady. Don't undo it.

536
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:46,005
- I will definitely try not to not undo it.
- Well, goodbye, all.

537
00:30:46,174 --> 00:30:47,874
- Goodbye, Rory.
- Bye, Grandma.

538
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,465
- Nope. Airplane.
- Oh, I can take it.

539
00:30:51,381 --> 00:30:52,779
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Ciao.

540
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:54,474
Come here, you.

541
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:59,594
- So, what are you guys doing home?
- We're trying to get some distance from the inn.

542
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:03,025
And it's going through the roof. Not the inn's roof - that's solid as a rock.

543
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:06,116
You know what I mean. We're booked to 90% capacity.

544
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:08,713
And the restaurant - we're turning people away. Oh, you know all that.

545
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:10,049
No, keep going.

546
00:31:10,116 --> 00:31:14,585
Well, customers agree that, despite Michel, we're their favorite Connecticut inn.

547
00:31:14,646 --> 00:31:16,438
That's nothing compared to the big town news.

548
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,801
- Wow. What?
- Sookie...

549
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:20,858
We walked past Dean's place, and Lindsay was throwing his stuff out on the street.

550
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:25,021
They were really going at it. It was like "Raging Bull. " There's yelling and screaming.

551
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:28,958
- Sookie, you're exploding all over the poor girl.
- Oh, sorry.

552
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:31,471
And she's probably hungry. You're hungry, right Honey?

553
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:32,853
Oh, I'll whip us something up.

554
00:31:32,915 --> 00:31:36,177
Oh no, you said you had to pick up Davey, so we'll go out, you know? We'll call you later.

555
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,683
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

556
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:45,240
Talk to you later.

557
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,215
See you later, Sookie.

558
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:50,780
What happened?

559
00:31:52,105 --> 00:31:57,650
It was unbelievable. It was bad. She was yelling. She was throwing things.

560
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:01,224
He was yelling. She called him a jerk. It was very violent and very public.

561
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,952
- Other people saw it. It was horrible.
- This was not supposed to happen.

562
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:08,777
You! You should be ashamed of yourself - what you did!

563
00:32:08,828 --> 00:32:10,728
- Just wait.
- What did she ever do to you, huh?

564
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:14,454
- How did she hurt you? Why are you doing this?
- Theresa, please. Calm down.

565
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:19,559
Calm down? My little girl has to come home and find your heinous letter in Dean's jacket.

566
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,540
- Listen, we're in the street...
- You little monster!

567
00:32:21,597 --> 00:32:23,359
Hey! Pull back, lady!

568
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:26,282
There aren't hundreds of other boys in the world? You have to go after her husband?

569
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:29,957
Okay, stop attacking my daughter right now. You're upset, I get it, but you do not do this.

570
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:33,358
She slept with my son-in-law. She broke up a marriage. Are you proud?

571
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:35,718
- She did not break up a marriage.
- What do you know of this?

572
00:32:35,774 --> 00:32:37,075
Enough. I know Rory.

573
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:41,033
All I know is that now my Lindsay is devastated, Dean is back with his parents,

574
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:44,207
lives are destroyed, and you and your daughter can go to hell!

575
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:54,350
Okay, I have got to know what was in that letter.

576
00:32:55,865 --> 00:32:56,680
Um...

577
00:32:58,753 --> 00:32:59,609
I...

578
00:33:01,907 --> 00:33:03,311
I told him...

579
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:05,368
that...

580
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:09,398
that night was special and...

581
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:12,860
that I wasn't sorry that it happened.

582
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:16,136
But he's married, and...

583
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:21,665
he has to figure out his life. So I was going to make it easier for him

584
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,880
and take myself out of the mix.

585
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:28,690
Well, that was a very good letter.

586
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:30,928
I can't believe she found it.

587
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:34,240
- We can't keep standing here.
- I know.

588
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:36,462
- These streets are dangerous right now.
- Very.

589
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:37,097
Come on.

590
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:45,407
Anything you want is on me. Pie, cake, pancakes, pan pie, cake pan, panacockin.

591
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:48,199
Say the word or make one up. It's yours.

592
00:33:48,717 --> 00:33:52,562
- Chair feels good.
- Yeah, yeah. A chair does feel good.

593
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,667
- I think a root beer might be good.
- Root beer sounds good!

594
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,591
- It's on the house, so go crazy.
- Luke!

595
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:01,479
- Hey. Hi, Rory. Welcome back.
- Thanks.

596
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:04,274
- Are you okay? You look a little pale.
- You know, pale's the new tan.

597
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:09,671
- So, you're here. You're not a mirage.
- I told you I was coming back.

598
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:12,963
But you lied to me repeatedly for weeks, so your credibility's been shattered.

599
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,867
I know. It's been seven weeks.

600
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:17,463
Seven weeks.

601
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:24,872
You know, I just remembered - I have an errand to run.

602
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,848
- Oh, yeah?
- I got to go to the pharmacy.

603
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,716
I'm gonna go now. Lane's here. She'll bring you your root beer.

604
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:33,024
- Hey, Lane, I got to run down to the pharmacy! Got an errand.
- Okay!

605
00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:34,708
So… I'll be back in a bit.

606
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:38,466
- Rory?!
- Hey, you!

607
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:41,548
- You're back! Our girl's back.
- I know.

608
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:44,314
- We need to consult.
- Oh, sounds serious.

609
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:46,858
- I'm in a quandary.
- Other people's quandaries. I'm all ears.

610
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:51,686
Hey, you know, I just remembered - I have to go to Doose's to... pick something up.

611
00:34:51,808 --> 00:34:53,642
- You need a banana or anything?
- I'm good.

612
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,375
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm consulting on a quandary. Go.

613
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:57,569
Okay. I'll be right back.

614
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:01,323
So, my quandary - are you ready? And I need honesty.

615
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:02,341
Shoot.

616
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:04,578
Am I in love with Zach?

617
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,069
What?

618
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:10,158
I need to know if you think I'm in love with Zach, 'cause a dirty trollop suggested it,

619
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:13,093
- and they're generally reliable about these things.
- A dirty trollop?

620
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:15,402
She said something to me and gave me this sort of knowing,

621
00:35:15,468 --> 00:35:21,075
worldly look that seemed to suggest I was acting in a way that said I have a thing for Zach,

622
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:24,229
or she was hitting on me. I just need to know your thought on this.

623
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,168
Hey. Are you listening?

624
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,014
- Hey. There you are.
- Hi.

625
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:37,234
So - oh, you really ran an errand.

626
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,986
I didn't run an errand, but I sort of kept up the pretense. So I went in the pharmacy.

627
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:44,524
So, I was in the pharmacy, so I had to buy something, so I…

628
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,295
- I feel kind of dumb.
- Yeah.

629
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:49,113
But you didn't really have an errand, right?

630
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,405
Naw, It was just getting kind of crowded back there, you know?

631
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,237
So, I brought you something.

632
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:59,408
My own smokes. Ginchy.

633
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:04,390
Oh. That's beautiful.

634
00:36:04,452 --> 00:36:08,523
I think that'll match the earrings I got you before. If they don't, I'll take them back.

635
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:10,130
Definitely goes.

636
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:14,074
- Oh, yeah, look at that. Perfect match.
- Perfect match.

637
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:22,906
I don't believe it. What the hell is this?

638
00:36:23,285 --> 00:36:24,298
Cider mill.

639
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:26,299
Oh for the love of…

640
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,580
- Hurry up, Michel!
- What are you doing here?

641
00:36:30,729 --> 00:36:33,539
- What are you doing here?
- I'm enjoying the cider mill parade.

642
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:38,045
Such culture I've been missing all these years. This band - so subtle.

643
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:40,866
- Like a polo mallet hitting your head.
- Come on!

644
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:43,872
- Yeah, Come on!
- Don't pull! I'm fragile!

645
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:50,528
- This town...
- "- is our town. This town is so glamorous".

646
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:52,289
So, we'll hook up later, maybe.

647
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:54,991
We'll hook up later. Definitely.

648
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:56,314
Good.

649
00:36:57,154 --> 00:36:58,475
I love the necklace.

650
00:36:58,994 --> 00:37:01,234
- Good.
- Good.

651
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:09,457
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, no! Oh, let me pay you.

652
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:13,865
I don't have any cash. Um, well, would you take an I.O.U.?

653
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:17,387
Have you been to the Dragonfly Inn? The food is great.

654
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:19,928
Would you like to - oh, I know. Do you smoke?

655
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,842
Hi.

656
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:43,540
I hope this is okay.

657
00:37:44,908 --> 00:37:47,247
I wasn't sure where to call, and I just had to...

658
00:37:48,288 --> 00:37:49,215
Are you okay?

659
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:55,697
- Am I okay?
- Yeah, I mean... how do you... feel?

660
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:59,494
- I'm sorry. That's a stupid question.
- No. It's not a stupid question.

661
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:02,741
Um... let's see. How do I feel?

662
00:38:03,735 --> 00:38:08,086
- Actually... I feel like an idiot.
- Why?

663
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:12,479
Why? Because I was married, … Rory. Married.

664
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:16,508
And I threw it all away for someone who dumped me once and then just bailed on me.

665
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:19,132
- I didn't just bail. I...
- I hurt everybody.

666
00:38:19,186 --> 00:38:22,996
I hurt Lindsay, I hurt her parents, I hurt my parents, and now I'm back at home,

667
00:38:23,046 --> 00:38:26,601
and you're in Europe with your grandmother. And what the hell was I thinking?

668
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:29,342
- I mean, what am I doing? What's wrong with me?
- Nothing.

669
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:33,922
I got to get ready for work.

670
00:38:56,015 --> 00:38:59,752
- So, finish your story.
- Everybody knows you don't mess with Hay Bale Bill.

671
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:04,356
So Hay Bale goes off and punches the guy, and it turned out to be the wrong guy -

672
00:39:04,402 --> 00:39:06,895
all over this perceived insult about his girlfriend's legs.

673
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:09,476
Wait - which one had hairy legs - Annie the Grog Girl

674
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:12,829
or Ocarina Jane, who secretly sold pot behind the brass-rubbing booth?

675
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,673
- You mean "hairiest. "
- Egads.

676
00:39:14,754 --> 00:39:17,929
I'm thinking bathing-suit season at the Renaissance Faire is only enjoyed by the blind.

677
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:19,988
Hey, I should bring steak sauce, right?

678
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,573
- For what?
- Pizza.

679
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:23,914
- I just got back from Italy.
- So?

680
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:25,932
So they'd shoot you in Italy for that.

681
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:30,007
But this is America, where we unapologetically bastardize other countries' cultures

682
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:32,424
in a gross quest for moral and military supremacy.

683
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:35,420
I forgot. Bring on the imperialistic condiments.

684
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:39,710
Hey, do you think Annie the Grog Girl made a pass at Luke?

685
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:43,361
I'm sure he rebuffed her, but he was there a long time.

686
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:46,704
I hope not. I'd joust the little slut.

687
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:54,600
- So, you want to talk about...
- Something to watch?

688
00:39:54,697 --> 00:39:57,677
- Uh, yes. Something to watch.
- You pick.

689
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:01,071
Will you be mad if it's "Showgirls" again?

690
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,629
I got the deluxe edition with shot glasses and a drinking game.

691
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,786
Sanctuary.

692
00:40:17,591 --> 00:40:21,213
- Let me show you one thing before "Showgirls," okay?
- What?

693
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:23,145
Home movies from my trip with Grandma.

694
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:26,110
- You have home movies?
- She was in fine form.

695
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:30,177
Signora distinctly wrote, "south rooms with a view and close together. "

696
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:33,737
Instead of which, she has given us north rooms without a view and a long way apart.

697
00:40:33,793 --> 00:40:36,359
- She gets very British when she's abroad.
- Oh, yes.

698
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:40,162
Hurry and get dressed, dear, or we'll miss our dinner, on top of everything else.

699
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:43,015
And you look very innocent and pretty.

700
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:45,298
It was a great view. I don't know what she was talking about.

701
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:49,635
.. What we were led to expect. I thought we were going to see...

702
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:52,614
the signora distinctly wrote, "south rooms with a view"...

703
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:58,478
