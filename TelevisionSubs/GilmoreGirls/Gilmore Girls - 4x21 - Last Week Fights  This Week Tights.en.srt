1
00:00:00,645 --> 00:00:03,752
No, no, boys. You go clockwise!

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,173
Clockwise! Can't you tell time?

3
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:09,389
The other way, boys! They're not getting it, Miss Patty.

4
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:11,503
Well, the wedding's tomorrow. We gotta get it.

5
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:13,773
It's the Banyan boys. They won't do what I tell them.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,778
Nice maypole, Patty! Really organized!

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,380
Oh, shut up, Kirk!

8
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:22,255
- Tough day, Patty? 
- I've worked with Joan Crawford. This is worse.

9
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:25,855
I don't call that a "maypole." I'd call that a "maybe-not pole."

10
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:26,712
What's with him?

11
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:29,358
He's mad because I made Chrissy my dance captain over him.

12
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:32,650
- Kirk has forty-three jobs. 
- Would you go talk to him, please?

13
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:35,148
- I got my hands full here. 
- The Banyan boys?

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,375
Oh! Lucifer tired of them in hell and dumped them here.

15
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,146
- I'll talk to Kirk. 
- Thank you.

16
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:43,541
All right, Chrissy, let's give it another go!

17
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,863
Hey, Kirk, maybe you want to ease up on Patty a little.

18
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,351
But the maypole is an expertise of mine.

19
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:53,668
I re-enacted the dwarf's maypole choreography from "The Safety Dance" video,

20
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:56,719
my junior-high talent show. Chicks were falling at my feet.

21
00:00:56,965 --> 00:01:00,349
- I'm less than impressed, Patty! 
- Take a break, please.

22
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,597
I've seen Miss Patty get violent. It's not pretty. Remember that time?

23
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:04,041
That's when she beat me up.

24
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:05,765
Yeah. Let's not repeat that.

25
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:23,858
They're the best I've got.

26
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,833
That's sad for you and the whole vegetable industry.

27
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:29,245
They're the best in the state. I stand by them.

28
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:33,402
- They're puny. They're tasteless. 
- Puny? These are not puny.

29
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:36,366
If they're small enough to shove up our son's nose, they're too small!

30
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:38,803
No way could you shove one of these up Davey's nose.

31
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,505
- Bet you five bucks. 
- Get him in here!

32
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:44,958
Hey, guys. You probably shouldn't shove a radish up your son's nose. Just thinking out loud.

33
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:48,399
All right, I'll take these if it's all you've got.

34
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,047
Don't do me any favors.

35
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,505
You two are back big-time.

36
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:56,012
That actually felt good. Like getting a Jack LaLanne workout.

37
00:02:56,637 --> 00:03:00,220
- Dead or alive? 
- Jack LaLanne? Dead. No -- alive.

38
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:02,391
Oh, now that's gonna bug me.

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,436
Hello?

40
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,610
- There is so much joy around me, I'm gonna hurl. 
- Hey, what's wrong?

41
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,949
You should see all the boisterous high-fiving going on all around me. It's sad.

42
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,929
- It's just really sad. Hey, do you mind, buddy? 
- Kids are in party mode, huh?

43
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,544
The kids are clicking their heels like there's no tomorrow.

44
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:18,228
And there is no tomorrow for those who do not have a final

45
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:20,410
on Saturday morning, such as me. I'm pathetic.

46
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,159
I should stand between two of them and have them high-five my head

47
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,197
from opposite sides and put me out of my misery.

48
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:27,224
Just one more final to go, then you'll be free.

49
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:30,230
Ahh, two more boisterous bozos just rubbing my face in it.

50
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:33,757
You know, I do have one thing to run by you. Do you have the brain power?

51
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:36,388
- I think I can swing it. 
- It involves the "J" word.

52
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,487
Oh, not more about Jesus. I'm sick of him and Mel Gibson.

53
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:40,332
Jess.

54
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,939
- Oh, what about him? 
- He's in town for that wedding

55
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,702
and I never know where we stand on the Jessometer. I've been seeing him.

56
00:03:45,798 --> 00:03:47,607
I was just wondering if you want me to tell you when I do.

57
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:48,692
- Sure. 
- Really?

58
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:50,130
- Why not? 
- Okay.

59
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:54,079
It's just always so weird -- this "J"-word topic of ours.

60
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:56,141
You don't have to refer to him as "the 'J' word."

61
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:58,267
Call him "Jess," and feel free to tell me when you see him.

62
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:01,277
I mean, if you see him eight times in one day,

63
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:04,560
you don't need to call me eight different times to tell me. That's clearly overdose.

64
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:05,123
Sure.

65
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:08,420
Maybe, like, you could limit the reports to just significant sightings.

66
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,729
If you see him a hundred yards away, disappearing around a corner,

67
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:11,880
I really don't need to know that.

68
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,394
If he comes up to you and spits in your face, report that.

69
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,823
- Permission to spit back? 
- You know what I'm saying.

70
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:19,121
I know what you're saying. Hey, you know what I should do?

71
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:22,583
Run up, tell him I love him, then run away really fast -- a taste of his own medicine.

72
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:24,947
Don't do that! Don't do anything out of the ordinary.

73
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:27,364
- I won't. Honey, I'm kidding. 
- What?

74
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,704
- There's a horse in the dining room. 
- What?

75
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:32,090
- Cletus is in the dining room. 
- Why?

76
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,259
He heard about the terrific continental breakfast? I don't know. I gotta go look into this.

77
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,133
Okay. Bye.

78
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:39,540
Cletus, honey!

79
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,824
Lorelai, I need your signature on this, please.

80
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:43,927
- Michel. 
- Yes?

81
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,584
Do you see the big-nostriled thing next to me here?

82
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,162
- The horse? 
- Uh-huh, the horse.

83
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:51,209
- It's been here for twenty minutes. 
- Oh. What were you doing about it?

84
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:53,451
- Nothing. 
- Oh, no, nothing?

85
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,095
It's a giant, smelly horse. I figured someone was already taking care of it.

86
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:59,169
- He's alive! 
- Who?

87
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,766
Jack LaLanne. I just googled him. Hi, Cletus.

88
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:03,312
Oh, so you already saw the horse?

89
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:05,959
- Yeah. Sure, he's been here, what, twenty, thirty minutes? 
- About twenty-five.

90
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,543
New Dragonfly Inn rule -- everyone listening?

91
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:14,637
Okay, if you see a horse in the inn or any other large quadruped or biped

92
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,869
or anything that's not -- what's the word -- human,

93
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:20,346
figure no one's doing anything about it and do something.

94
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:22,722
- Oh, fine with me. 
- Yeah, same here.

95
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:25,969
If we had the rule before, I would have done something.

96
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,360
Okay. Great. Thanks. Bye.

97
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,177
Come on, troublemaker.

98
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:34,472
- Hittin' the road, Glenn? 
- Yep, and I got a hot date tonight.

99
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,397
- Who's the lucky girl? 
- I'm getting back together with my girl from back home.

100
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,209
- Want to see her picture? 
- Sure.

101
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:43,627
- Glenn, this girl is, like, twelve years old. 
- It's her when she was little.

102
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:47,333
Don't make this into something dirty! She drives and everything.

103
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,593
Have a good summer, Glenn.

104
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:54,206
Oh, Rory, perfect timing. I want you to meet somebody.

105
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:58,522
- This is my boyfriend, Chester Fleet. 
- Oh, hi, Chester. I've heard a lot about you.

106
00:05:58,706 --> 00:05:59,914
You can't believe everything you hear.

107
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:02,755
Oh, it's kind of a weird day to meet him because he lost a bet with me.

108
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:06,590
And that means that for the entire day, he can only talk in clichés. It's so much fun.

109
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,935
- Sounds it. 
- It's always fun till someone gets hurt.

110
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,499
Hey, I'm leaving, guys.

111
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,216
- Rory, you get yourself a funky monkey? 
- What?

112
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:16,704
Everyone poured all the alcohol they had left into a bowl and that's what's in the cup.

113
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:19,478
- Tastes gross, but does the trick. 
- I stashed one in the fridge for you.

114
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:21,377
It was poured for me, but I'm not having one.

115
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:24,942
- Lips that touch wine shall never touch mine. 
- So much fun!

116
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:28,797
Well, I guess this is goodbye. See you, Rory. Have a good one.

117
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:31,003
- Bye, Janet. 
- Janet, wait, wait!

118
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:36,477
I hate that our little clique is breaking up. It's so the end of something.

119
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,369
- You off your meds, Paris? 
- You never get emotional at goodbyes?

120
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,135
With people I like.

121
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,046
- See you. 
- Keep in touch.

122
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:48,964
So I made a collage of photos of people in the building, and I'm having everyone sign.

123
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:50,849
- Will you two do me the honor? 
- Sure.

124
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:53,009
- I'll honor you. 
- Isn't it a great keepsake?

125
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,851
There's Janet with her boyfriend and Lana with hers.

126
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:57,909
That's Mark and Stacy -- they're inseparable.

127
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,926
- And, oh, there's one of you, Rory. 
- That's me.

128
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:03,084
And, Janet and her boyfriend again, and me with Chester.

129
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:05,974
- You're the apple of my eye. 
- That's getting annoying there, Chester.

130
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:10,699
And, there you are again, Rory, with... oh, that's a lamppost.

131
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:13,776
Oh, here's a bunch of couples from Valentine's Day. You're not in that one.

132
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,734
And here you are with all the cafeteria ladies. I can make you a copy of that, if you'd like.

133
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:20,755
- That's okay. 
- Rory, you've had quite the dry spell this year.

134
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:23,709
- I have not had a dry spell. 
- There's not one picture of you with a guy.

135
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:27,284
Oh, no. No. There's one. See? That's Rory with the statue of Eli Yale.

136
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:28,250
People are gonna talk.

137
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,207
I don't care what people say.

138
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,914
- Are people talking? 
- Not that I've heard. You just don't get out enough.

139
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,832
All work and no play makes Jack...

140
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:39,509
- Say goodbye before you leave? 
- Will do.

141
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:43,826
Since when are you someone who defines a girl by whether or not she's with a guy?

142
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,351
I mean, you embarrassed me in front of Tana and Chester.

143
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:49,561
Please. They were singing the lumberjack song at the top of their lungs.

144
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:51,456
They're embarrassment-proof. Here.

145
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:54,076
What's this? Leonard Fleming?

146
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,066
Asher's son. He's a terrific guy -- good looking, runs a mutual fund,

147
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:59,267
- newly divorced, and on the hunt. 
- I don't think so.

148
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:02,663
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. He is one hot apple, juicy to the core.

149
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,151
- I got it. Nice, hot apple. 
- I just want you to be happy.

150
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,293
Please, don't feel sorry for me. I'm fine.

151
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:08,955
I don't want you to have a long, dry summer.

152
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,644
Please stop talking about my love life.

153
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:13,148
Fine. Wish me a merry trip to jolly old England.

154
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,177
Have a merry trip.

155
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:17,009
And hey, if you call Leonard and one of his kids answers, hang up.

156
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:18,341
They still think Mommy's coming back.

157
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:23,173
Oh, hey, Mrs. Kim.

158
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:24,822
Hello, Lorelai. What can I do for you?

159
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:29,328
Well, do you still have the big door knockers -- metal with the chipped red paint?

160
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:33,578
You're a magician. Do you know that? Oh, it's great. Isn't it big?

161
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:36,250
And good price, seeing as how it may have belonged to James Madison.

162
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:38,892
It was commonly known that James Madison liked big knockers.

163
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,087
I bet a lot of the founding fathers liked big knockers.

164
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:45,328
I'm sorry for laughing. I'd explain if I could.

165
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:48,258
It's a double entendre. I've been in this country 20 years. I get things.

166
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:49,158
I never doubted.

167
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:50,924
- It's ninety dollars. 
- I'll take it.

168
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:54,600
- Here. 
- What's this?

169
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:57,166
Mail for Lane. I know you go to Luke's, where she works.

170
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:59,700
If you could pass this on to her, I would appreciate it.

171
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,747
- Mrs. Kim, hasn't this gone on long enough? 
- Not for you to say.

172
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:06,750
She's your only child. I know you miss her. She misses you.

173
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:10,717
- Call her. See her. Don't avoid her. 
- This is between me and my daughter.

174
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:12,719
Well, as your mailman, I hereby resign.

175
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:15,644
Fine.

176
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,045
It comes to $140.

177
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,881
- You said ninety. 
- Wrapping charge.

178
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:27,000
And it's not just guys -- girls are not supposed to be monogamous, either.

179
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:30,031
- We're homo sapiens, not rocks. 
- That'so unromantic.

180
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:32,165
You can say that. You got lucky.

181
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:35,959
- Yeah, T.J. Is yum, yum. 
- I did get lucky, didn't I?

182
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,709
We're animals, and animals in the wild don't mate for life,

183
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,629
except, like, tigers, but they're retarded.

184
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:43,061
- Hey, Liz. 
- Men are good for two things.

185
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,372
Make that one, and the one thing they're not that good at.

186
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,363
Excuse me, sorry to break up the festivities,

187
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:50,287
but do you have any idea if I'm doing this right?

188
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:52,477
Most guys don't know if they're doing it right.

189
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:56,282
Not my expertise, bro, but they smell good, if that helps.

190
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,664
Well, there should have been an instruction book of some kind.

191
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:02,092
I'm so sorry this got dumped on you, but the turkey leg guy knew

192
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,161
that going into that bar violated his parole. You can't reason with him.

193
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,141
Is this how turkey legs are supposed to look?

194
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:09,670
I don't know. Take off your pants and let us see.

195
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:12,436
Hey, weren't you guys going to a spa or something?

196
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:14,198
- Yeah, we're going, right? 
- In a minute.

197
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,202
- I need to get some batteries. I'll be back. 
- Jess! Jess! Come over here and meet my oldest friends.

198
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,059
- Watch the one on the left. 
- Thanks.

199
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:24,437
- Girls, this is Jess. 
- Hello, handsome.

200
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:28,272
He's gonna walk me down the aisle. Is that cool or what?

201
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,786
- It's no big deal. 
- It's a very big deal.

202
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,960
- Can I help you? 
- Got a package here.

203
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,708
- From who? I'm not expecting anything. 
- It's a very important package.

204
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,562
- But there's no address on it. 
- Have fun.

205
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:42,398
- Have fun with what? 
- This package is for Liz Danes.

206
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:44,288
- Oh, that -- that's me. 
- Do you accept delivery?

207
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:46,269
I guess.

208
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:56,371
- Shake it, doll, shake it. 
- No, don't shake it in here.

209
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,427
- Luke, we need change! 
- Turn these twenties into ones!

210
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:01,577
I don't believe this, you rats!

211
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:03,671
Earn your money for Mama!

212
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:17,065
Nail polish remover -- $1.40.

213
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:20,569
Ladies Speed Stick -- $2.60. Good choice on that one.

214
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,940
Keeps you dry all day and into the night. Jasmine body lotion -- nice price on that.

215
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:27,353
- Might want to get a couple. 
- It's for my wife.

216
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:30,967
And, with your emery boards, it comes to $19.67.

217
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:33,393
Keep the change.

218
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:40,870
I'm so sorry you have a final tomorrow. I thought you'd be free as a bird tonight.

219
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:41,853
Them's the breaks.

220
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,149
You could have stayed at school and studied if you had to. I hope you know that.

221
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,543
You're playing different music.

222
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:50,162
The music -- it's different. Some chick is singing.

223
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:52,242
It's "Blossom Deary." You don't like it?

224
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:55,840
No, I like it fine. You've just never played it. You and Dad always play classical music.

225
00:11:55,957 --> 00:11:58,103
- We just thought we'd try something new tonight. 
- We?

226
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,990
He's out of town, but you know what I mean. We talked about changing the music.

227
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,103
So when will you be done with your final tomorrow?

228
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,361
Around noon, depending on how fast I write.

229
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,205
Any friends left behind to keep you company -- girlfriends, boyfriends?

230
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:15,332
Well, my roommates are all gone, and I'd say 95% of the class has vamoosed.

231
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,355
- And you don't have a boyfriend? 
- Not really.

232
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:18,261
Why, do you?

233
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:21,497
- I'm making a joke. 
- I was just wondering.

234
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:25,307
We haven't talked about your love life in a while. I get to ask sometimes, don't I?

235
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,741
Sure.

236
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:29,684
- Where'd you say Dad was? 
- In Philadelphia.

237
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,962
Thanks, Mom. Philadelphia, huh?

238
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:34,948
Funny, you didn't mention that to me when we talked earlier. You just said he wouldn't be here.

239
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:38,577
Well, what do you want, Lorelai? For his secretary to fax you his schedule?

240
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:40,293
No, I just want to be kept informed.

241
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:45,971
Well, a lot of his schedule these days has to do with Floyd AKA your ex-boyfriend's father.

242
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:48,076
I didn't know how much detail you wanted to hear.

243
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,113
I hear you. Blossom hears you. We're good.

244
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:53,155
- So you'll be a free girl around noon? 
- Around then.

245
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:56,821
I just wanted to know because I to be thinking about you right at that moment

246
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:59,863
- when the weight is lifting off your shoulders. 
- I'll be looking forward to it.

247
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:04,317
I'll be right back. I'm going to see if Kiki put the raspberry soufflés in.

248
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:06,543
- Dad hates raspberries. 
- No, he doesn't.

249
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,012
Oh, sorry, thought he did. Sorry.

250
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:14,264
- What is going on here? 
- I'm trying to get her to fess up to the separation.

251
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,595
No, me! Am I cloaked in loneliness or something?

252
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:19,215
Everybody has been pestering me about my love life this week.

253
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,935
That was not about you. It was about evading my questions.

254
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:24,496
It's a classic Sun Tzu "Art of War" maneuver.

255
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:27,545
If you're being attacked from the east, attack whoever's to your west,

256
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:30,259
and you were the west. I never read the book. It's full of crap like that.

257
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,195
Well, stop attacking her so she'll stop attacking me.

258
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:35,758
Well, you butted into my line of inquiry with your, "He's in Philadelphia" stuff.

259
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:37,790
- She was about ready to crack. 
- She was not ready to crack.

260
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,404
She was ready to say, "He's in Philadelphia."

261
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,293
Did he sound like he was in Philadelphia when he called?

262
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,206
You mean, did I hear guys in the background saying, "Get your Philly cheesesteak here?"

263
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,691
- Why aren't you seeing anybody, by the way? 
- I'm gonna throw a roll at you.

264
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,605
I just gotta know what's going on with them.

265
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:51,380
They're having some sort of marital difficulty, Mom,

266
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:54,529
- and pressuring her like this is not going to help. 
- But I'm dying here.

267
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:59,307
I mean, if he's out of town, is she actually staying here instead of that hotel she checked into?

268
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,071
Or is she staying here permanently, and he's the one who's at a hotel? Or...

269
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:06,818
Well, thank God I checked or we would have been soufflé-less.

270
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,244
Well, good, good. Gotta have that soufflé.

271
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,089
- So, where were we? 
- We were all about to switch to new subjects.

272
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:14,452
Oh, okay.

273
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:17,575
Dad hates chicken Kiev, doesn't he?

274
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:22,470
Well, who called Groton?

275
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:23,717
- I didn't. 
- Me neither.

276
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:28,393
Someone in this room called someone in Groton at 11:37 P.M. on the 16th, and it wasn't me.

277
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:30,968
That was the night you had those two trampy girls over, Zach.

278
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:31,921
They weren't trampy.

279
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:35,408
I heard one of them call her boyfriend and brag that she had scored some sucker beer.

280
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,379
I'll pay for Groton.

281
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:42,370
Does that doorbell run on electricity? 'Cause that's eating up money, too.

282
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:43,538
We have to tell people to knock.

283
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:46,763
- Aunt Jun. 
- I'm here on your mother's behalf.

284
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:48,258
- She would like to visit. 
- Here?

285
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:49,585
- A social call. 
- When?

286
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,521
Here are three times she can come this week.

287
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:53,839
If none are convenient, she will offer three more.

288
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:57,485
If those are not good, she will rescind the offer. Does this sound reasonable?

289
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,954
- Very. 
- Fine.

290
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,565
- Is she bringing a Bible? 
- She didn't say.

291
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:04,169
- Here's your mail. 
- Thank you.

292
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,313
- Would you like to come in? 
- No.

293
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,656
Rory?

294
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,057
Grandma, hi.

295
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:19,762
You busy?

296
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,140
No, I was just packing and having a little lemonade here.

297
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:27,606
- You're done with your final, right? 
- Yes. What are you doing here?

298
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:31,867
Well, I had lunch today on campus with a friend -- Cassie Sullivan.

299
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:34,836
She's with the alumni committee. Didn't I mention it last night?

300
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:36,275
Not that I remember.

301
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,170
Anyway, she has a son who's a freshman also -- Graham Sullivan.

302
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:42,142
- You haven't met him? 
- I don't think so.

303
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:43,572
- Would you like to? 
- Sure.

304
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,931
- Is now okay? 
- Now?

305
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:46,130
Graham!

306
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,545
Graham, this is Rory.

307
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:51,803
Rory, Graham.

308
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,359
Graham's family and ours go way back. I remember this young man in diapers.

309
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:01,214
He's one of the poor unfortunates who had a Saturday final, too.

310
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:02,945
- Chemistry. 
- Philosophy.

311
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:07,317
I meant to introduce the two of you ages ago. I hate that it's last minute like this.

312
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,877
- I feel awful. 
- Oh, that's okay. Don't feel bad.

313
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:11,792
Alcohol on your breath.

314
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:16,508
Graham mentioned that he and his group were going out tonight to celebrate.

315
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:19,185
- What did you call them -- "the Saturday orphans"? 
- Yes, I did.

316
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,295
- And he thought you might like to go. 
- Yeah.

317
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,301
Would you... like to go?

318
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:25,991
- Sure. 
- Wonderful!

319
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:30,106
I actually tried to get your grandmother to go, too, but she made up some dumb excuse.

320
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:32,544
You're something else, you know that?

321
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:36,158
Well, I feel good about this. My orphan is an orphan no more.

322
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,146
I'll go now. Bye, Rory.

323
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:39,958
Bye, grandma.

324
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:46,962
Okay, well, lesson number one -- when your mom or your grandmother

325
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:50,618
starts trying to pin down your specific whereabouts at a specific time and place,

326
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,770
and she's smiling kind of weird, begin evasive maneuvers immediately.

327
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:56,327
Got caught in that one myself.

328
00:16:56,633 --> 00:17:01,140
And lesson number two -- never, ever let anybody outside of your family see you in diapers.

329
00:17:01,256 --> 00:17:02,824
You were young... I hope.

330
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:09,906
- Oh, you don't have to do that. 
- Oh, I just taped up eight of my own boxes.

331
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:13,961
- I'm a box-taping machine. Use me. 
- Oh, thank you.

332
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,586
So, the plans for tonight -- they're pretty casual.

333
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:19,818
There'll be about ten of us. You're totally welcome to come.

334
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,654
I was just gonna go home, but, I don't know, maybe.

335
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:25,885
We're gonna get some food, hang out. I'll leave you my cell phone number.

336
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:29,207
- You got a piece of paper? 
- Yeah.

337
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,530
Leonard Fleming.

338
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,325
Ignore that.

339
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:42,662
- Maybe I'll see you later. 
- Yeah.

340
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,511
Enjoy your lemonade.

341
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:52,310
What is wrong with this shoe polish?

342
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,281
Pontius Pilate was alive when you bought it?

343
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,652
- Shoe polish goes bad? 
- It's all chunky.

344
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:59,575
- Aah, it messed up my shoes. 
- Just wipe them off. They'll be fine.

345
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,621
- Don't you have a full-length mirror? 
- Don't need one.

346
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,760
You don't like looking at your bottom half? I love looking at my bottom half.

347
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:08,078
I look down to look at my bottom half. I don't need a mirror to do that.

348
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,235
- You seem nervous. 
- I'm not nervous.

349
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:13,138
I don't see why you would be. I'm the one getting shackled today.

350
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:15,596
- Looks like old polish. 
- Yep.

351
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:18,023
The Queer Eye guys are very against old polish.

352
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,059
- He's very nervous. 
- I'm not nervous.

353
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:23,793
- Maybe it's time you put a shirt on. 
- Why, am I getting you hot?

354
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:26,215
- I need the bathroom. 
- Just hold on.

355
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:29,425
I am lovin' these tights. They're fantastic.

356
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:32,938
They lend support everywhere you need it, but they breathe.

357
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:35,190
- This one. 
- Thanks.

358
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:37,905
Hey, Luke, I had to borrow your deodorant. I hope that's okay.

359
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:39,997
Allow me.

360
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:51,186
Greetings, my lord. Your lady hath arrived to be escorted forthwith.

361
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,983
That's pretty good. I didn't know you spoke Renaissance.

362
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,902
Oh, yeah. I'm quite fluent in Renaissance. You look nice. I'm lovin' the tie.

363
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,565
Thanks. You look beautiful.

364
00:18:57,912 --> 00:18:59,669
Flattery will get you everywhere, my friend.

365
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,959
- Shall we? 
- Let's go.

366
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,128
No, really, a nice, manly wreath in your hair wouldn't work?

367
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,055
There's no such thing as a manly wreath.

368
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:23,299
Oh, I don't know. Julius Caesar pulled it off. He was very popular with the ladies.

369
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:26,191
Cleopatra used to pull his leaves off -- very sexy.

370
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:31,541
What's this? Surely these be time travelers from the future in such foreign, mystical garb.

371
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:33,702
- And who be you, kind sir? 
- T.J.'s brother.

372
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,717
I got a patio furniture store down in Nutley. Plastic, metal, teak...

373
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:39,841
- whatever you need, I can hook you up. 
- Okay, thank you.

374
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:44,121
Just do me a favor. I'm gonna try to keep a happy, proud look on my face

375
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:47,107
to cover the smirking and about-to-laugh-my-ass-off face just underneath.

376
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,659
- Help me achieve this. 
- Oh, come on.

377
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,919
They have a community of people, friends, you know, who travel together,

378
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,747
engage in silliness, dress in costume. I think it's nice.

379
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:57,363
- Hi, Lucas. 
- Oh! Hi, Carrie.

380
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:59,575
- Is that a power suit? 
- It's my only suit.

381
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:03,838
Looks pretty powerful to me. So, Barry stayed home.

382
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:05,283
- Who? 
- The ball and chain.

383
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:08,181
- I'm flying solo tonight. Save a dance for me? 
- I don't dance.

384
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:11,929
- You will dance. 
- Hey, how 'bout we work on him together?

385
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:14,986
I think there's a hoofer buried deep inside there, don't you?

386
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:17,065
- I guess. 
- Carrie, this is Lorelai.

387
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,795
- I know. Hi. 
- Hi.

388
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:24,012
So, there's gonna be a little delay. Liz ripped her dress, and it's gonna take a while to fix it.

389
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:26,102
I'm supposed to spread the message.

390
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,549
Well spread it, Car -- the message, the message.

391
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:32,962
She makes me very uncomfortable.

392
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:34,840
Poor Liz. Does she know how to fix something like that?

393
00:20:34,923 --> 00:20:36,833
She was never one for household skills.

394
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:39,664
- I'm gonna go see. She's at Miss Patty's? 
- Don't leave me alone.

395
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:42,726
Carrie found the guy with the codpiece. That will keep her occupied.

396
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:44,759
Hurry back.

397
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:50,513
Oh, Lorelai, thank heavens. I'm so bad with wardrobe.

398
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:52,824
I ripped it getting up. I'm such a klutz.

399
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,751
Oh, well, that's why I'm here. Patty, you have a sewing kit?

400
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:58,214
- Oh, yeah. Right here, sweetie. 
- I'm holding everyone up.

401
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:02,644
No, no. Hey, today's your day. If anyone gets to hold things up, it's you. Relax.

402
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:05,561
Ohh, I'm nervous. Do I look nervous? I sound nervous.

403
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:08,623
You look great. It's normal to be nervous on your wedding day.

404
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:11,604
This is my first wedding of mine that I've ever been sober for.

405
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,489
I'm probably gonna remember this one.

406
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,735
The ones that you remember are the ones that stick.

407
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:17,486
What was your wedding like? Were you this nervous?

408
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,345
- Never been married. 
- You got a kid.

409
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:22,345
- Found a way around that. 
- I see. You want to get married?

410
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,735
Oh, now, Liz. It's inappropriate for you to propose to me on your wedding day.

411
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:29,733
But do you want to get married? You must want to get married.

412
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,802
I guess so, you know, if I meet the right guy.

413
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,491
I hate being single. Ever think, if you got married today or even in the next few years,

414
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,624
you could be married for fifty years -- for most of your life.

415
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:44,428
Same with me and T.J. I could be married most of my life to him.

416
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:47,295
- Isn't that weird to think about? 
- I could be married for most of my life.

417
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,675
I don't want to screw up this marriage even more than I want some pot.

418
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:52,144
That's how serious I am.

419
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:55,534
Are you ready? The crowd's getting restless.

420
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:58,375
You're getting restless. Hey, do you two know each other?

421
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:00,945
Oh, Jess and I go way back. He dated my daughter.

422
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,634
- Oh, you broke her daughter's heart? 
- Ah, I...

423
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:06,152
No, no, he didn't. It just didn't work out.

424
00:22:06,317 --> 00:22:09,060
Good, 'cause I don't want him to be like his father, breaking hearts.

425
00:22:09,143 --> 00:22:11,748
I want him to be like T.J. Or my second husband

426
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:15,955
or, like my boyfriend after my third husband, who died. They were good guys.

427
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:17,116
Oh. You're all done.

428
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:20,145
- Oh, it's perfect! 
- Oh, she's a miracle worker.

429
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:22,034
- I'm gonna go tell the others. 
- Thanks, hon!

430
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:24,734
And thank you. You're gonna make a great wife some day

431
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:27,744
and a great sister-in-law to some very lucky girl.

432
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:30,156
- Well, I hope so. 
- Now, go on, Luke's waiting.

433
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:32,900
Unless my friend Carrie suffocated him with her boobs.

434
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:34,779
Well, that would be festive. Here, Patty.

435
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:37,466
Let's check your hair real quick, sweetie.

436
00:22:37,702 --> 00:22:38,588
Oh, okay.

437
00:22:56,949 --> 00:22:58,818
- Everything okay? 
- Crisis averted.

438
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:03,303
Must be starting.

439
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:04,623
Think they know any Zeppelin?

440
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:08,540
Ooh, roses -- nice.

441
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:11,398
Does she remind you of someone?

442
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,551
Can you say Leslie Van Houten?

443
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:23,241
- Now, that's impressive. 
- Yeah.

444
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:25,887
These tights, I'm telling you -- the best.

445
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:29,395
I'm happy, my boys are happy, and they don't ride up.

446
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,532
Hey... still dry. Thanks, buddy.

447
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:35,876
- You dried his armpits? 
- I don't want to talk about it.

448
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:42,753
Oh, I want one of those.

449
00:23:50,842 --> 00:23:52,624
- She looks happy. 
- Yeah, she does.

450
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,042
- She looks hot. 
- Smokin'.

451
00:23:58,144 --> 00:23:59,348
Don't you say that.

452
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,156
Where's the minister?

453
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:16,228
As kids we shared our toys

454
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:19,412
with all the girls and boys

455
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:26,089
barrel of monkeys, your battleship sunk me, please recall the joy

456
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,202
Wheelo, Clue, Mousetrap

457
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:32,325
bash and spirograph

458
00:24:32,485 --> 00:24:35,663
kaleidoscopes spinning, Yahtzee I'm winning

459
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:38,624
think of how we laughed

460
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:41,751
but today we share our love

461
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:44,696
today we share our love

462
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:50,942
for love is the greatest toy around

463
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:53,911
around, around

464
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:55,661
Help.

465
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:58,321
- Think of something not funny. 
- Can't.

466
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:00,814
You may plant the ceremonial sword.

467
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:07,372
- Avalanches, earthquakes... 
- Not doin' it.

468
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:08,755
Famine... and I'm out.

469
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,693
Hello, friends. Isn't it a beautiful day?

470
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:18,555
The day that Liz and T.J. share their love in front of those they love.

471
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:21,899
Liz, do you want to tell T.J. how you feel?

472
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:22,764
Yes.

473
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:26,332
- T.J. 
- Yeah?

474
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,056
My heart just pours out to you.

475
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,492
You have been so good to me and for me.

476
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:34,504
I don't know where I'd be without you.

477
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:36,967
I'd be worse off, I know that.

478
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:40,555
You're something else.

479
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:42,792
Nice. T.J.

480
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:48,990
Well, I wrote something down, but, for all the good points about tights

481
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:52,277
-- and there are a lot -- they don't have pockets.

482
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,568
So I gotta go off the cuff.

483
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,394
I love ya.

484
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:04,457
Aw, that wasn't so funny.

485
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,541
Nah, that wasn't funny at all.

486
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:14,318
- Hi, Mama. 
- Hello, Lane. Thank you for having me.

487
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:15,568
You find the place okay?

488
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:20,282
Yes. Here. Multi-grain soy pudding. Extra chunky, the way you like it.

489
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,754
I bet we'll all like it.

490
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:22,767
We?

491
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:24,588
Come in, Mama.

492
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:31,244
Mama, these are my roommates -- Zach and Brian.

493
00:26:31,404 --> 00:26:33,164
- Hello, Mrs. Kim. 
- Welcome.

494
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,340
There's no way I could afford a place on my own, so we live together.

495
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:38,725
We share all the expenses and a bathroom.

496
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:41,459
That's unfortunate, but we're starving artists, Mama.

497
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:42,554
These are my bandmates.

498
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:45,715
- Zach, would you make us some tea? 
- I'd be delighted.

499
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:46,974
I'll get the cups.

500
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:51,981
How about a tour? This is the living room, obviously.

501
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:56,636
- That's where Zach and Brian sleep. 
- A solid eight hours every night.

502
00:26:57,254 --> 00:26:58,549
This is my room.

503
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:04,493
Window's broken but the landlord's on it. Kitchen, refrigerator...

504
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:07,044
Would you like to pick a tea? We have a whole selection.

505
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:10,720
Lapsang oolong, orange pekoe, Sleepy Time?

506
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:21,437
Harry, they've got turkey legs!

507
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:26,091
I was born four hundred years too late. I mean, this food is amazing.

508
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:28,200
- Here's a couple seats. 
- Okay.

509
00:27:28,758 --> 00:27:30,421
- There were boys. 
- What? Where?

510
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:33,765
- At Lane's -- two boys -- one with hair. 
- Okay, you went to Lane's?

511
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:36,703
And the place -- broken furniture and dirt and boys

512
00:27:36,787 --> 00:27:38,476
- and a broken window and boys... 
- Slow down.

513
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:40,970
- and a tiny fridge and guitars and boys. 
- How many boys where there?

514
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,875
- Two boys. 
- Two boys.

515
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,525
She stood in that room with two boys.

516
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,077
I didn't stand alone in a room with two boys until I was -- I've never done that.

517
00:27:47,195 --> 00:27:49,432
- Mrs. Kim, you know why the boys were there. 
- She's dirty.

518
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:53,104
She's not dirty. She was trying to be up front with you, and that's good.

519
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:54,635
She could have hid them from you, and she didn't.

520
00:27:54,722 --> 00:27:56,324
- I wish she did. 
- No, you don't.

521
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:58,768
I've met those boys. They're innocent.

522
00:27:58,854 --> 00:28:02,177
As innocent as if she was living with two girls. So think of them that way.

523
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:03,799
- What way? 
- Think of them as girls.

524
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:04,972
- Girls? 
- Girls.

525
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,274
I don't like girls either.

526
00:28:06,355 --> 00:28:07,819
- Well, you like them better than boys. 
- True.

527
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,005
- And Lane is trying so hard. 
- Girls.

528
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:14,788
Yeah, think of them as two tall, gawky, caring, sometimes unwashed girls

529
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:17,081
who are watching out for your daughter's safety.

530
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,748
Girls. Girls.

531
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:27,071
- Is she okay? 
- She will be. She'll be okay.

532
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,600
Ooh, hey, look. Jess made a friend.

533
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:33,081
People think prison's a waste of time, but prison's the best thing that ever happened to me.

534
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:33,901
Interesting.

535
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,586
Picked up skills -- metal working, laundry -- that's a skill.

536
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,900
Doing laundry for 600 guys -- no piece of cake.

537
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:41,836
Great.

538
00:28:42,507 --> 00:28:45,226
- Added fabric softener for cigarettes. 
- Career guidance?

539
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:47,750
He's doing better. He's gonna be okay.

540
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:53,183
It's like a marketing thing. Don't call 'em "tights." You guys don't want to wear "tights."

541
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,125
Call 'em "air pants." Here's your slogan -- "air pants -- the pants that breathe."

542
00:28:57,258 --> 00:28:59,945
I'm telling you, we gotta get in on the ground floor of this.

543
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:02,942
There they are -- my two heroes. You saved the wedding.

544
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:05,651
- I saved nothing. 
- And you're always my hero, my big brother.

545
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:09,591
- Congratulations, sis. 
- Wasn't Jess great? It made all the difference.

546
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:12,772
It wasn't like it was a hard thing to do, but he did it good.

547
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:18,932
- You say "goodbye" before you leave. 
- I'm just going to get more food.

548
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:20,498
- You promise? 
- I promise.

549
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:22,486
Come on, let's get some chow.

550
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:24,748
Okay. Bye, guys.

551
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:31,553
- Oh, she's so happy. 
- Yeah, and he really loves tights.

552
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:34,004
- Oh, you want to know something weird? 
- What?

553
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:38,178
When I was at Miss Patty's, Jess was there.

554
00:29:38,264 --> 00:29:40,491
And he had his backpack, and it was open,

555
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:43,145
and I saw this book. I thought I was seeing things.

556
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,782
- A book? 
- Yes.

557
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,721
It was a self-help book with some goofy title like, "Learn to Love"

558
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:51,213
or "How to Love When You're Unloved" or something like that.

559
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:53,834
- Isn't that bizarre? 
- I don't know.

560
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:55,786
Well, I'll answer for you. It is bizarre.

561
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:59,288
Maybe he's just trying to learn something, better himself.

562
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:03,209
- Have you seen this book? 
- I know nothing about this book.

563
00:30:03,296 --> 00:30:06,281
- Those kinds of books are idiotic. 
- Not if they help people.

564
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,856
I can't believe you're not mocking this book, which is so pathetically mockable.

565
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:13,782
Maybe it's more pathetic if people don't try. And maybe he's trying. You ever think of that?

566
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:16,968
- No, but... 
- He can read whatever he wants to read.

567
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,388
I forgot to get something to drink. You need something to drink?

568
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:21,160
I'm fine.

569
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:29,086
No way! No way! Duke is gonna dominate the ACC Again.

570
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:31,329
- No way. 
- Williams? Redick?

571
00:30:31,677 --> 00:30:35,695
Graham, Redick has a 96% free-throw average. It's a done deal.

572
00:30:35,768 --> 00:30:39,588
- Carolina is coming back -- no question. 
- Question. Question.

573
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,362
What is that? Your patented 5-beer comeback?

574
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:46,156
Seven free throws, man. All season -- seven. That's it.

575
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:51,630
- You're not drinking. 
- I'm fine.

576
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:52,961
So you only drink alone?

577
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:54,987
- Pardon me? 
- The lemonade?

578
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:58,255
That was just a roommate thing. I don't usually drink.

579
00:30:58,404 --> 00:30:59,777
Oh... pity.

580
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:04,301
You want to get back to your group?

581
00:31:04,584 --> 00:31:06,873
Not if it's suddenly gonna get exciting over here.

582
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:08,495
I wouldn't count on it.

583
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:10,247
You have got to lighten up.

584
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:12,407
Gee, that's one of my favorite phrases.

585
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:16,657
- That's a sign, boys. 
- Mucky duck?

586
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:17,650
Mucky duck!

587
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:21,178
Let's go.

588
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:24,706
- We just got here. 
- Well, what's a pub crawl without the crawl?

589
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:25,780
Who's got my keys?

590
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:28,177
He's driving?

591
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:30,348
He's one of the best drunk drivers in Connecticut.

592
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:31,618
Top fifty, easy.

593
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:33,184
You ready?

594
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:35,643
Actually, I just think I'm gonna take off.

595
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:38,019
- What? 
- Yeah, I'm kind of tired.

596
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,934
-  Rory! 
- Thanks for everything.

597
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:42,770
Well, do you want me to drive you home?

598
00:31:43,614 --> 00:31:44,971
We came here with Jonah.

599
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:48,370
Right. Well, you need money for a cab?

600
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:49,355
I got money.

601
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:51,223
I feel kind of bad.

602
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:52,534
Don't.

603
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,222
Okay. See you later.

604
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:56,716
Bye.

605
00:31:57,478 --> 00:31:58,514
Putz.

606
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:03,490
Excuse me, is there an ATM here?

607
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:06,435
A few blocks down. I wouldn't walk, though. It gets dicey at night.

608
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:24,923
Hi, it's me. I'm kind of stuck and I... Well, I didn't know who else to call.

609
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:30,438
Okay, it looks like Brian's paying for call waiting for the next two months.

610
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,419
It's not over till it's over.

611
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,482
Lane, door!

612
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:39,699
I'll throw in my share of next month's gas bill, I'm that confident.

613
00:32:39,813 --> 00:32:41,052
You're gonna eat your confidence.

614
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,026
- Mama. 
- I'm back.

615
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:45,997
- Pause it, pause it, pause it. 
- Come in.

616
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:52,736
This, we'll clean up. Window will be fixed. Temporary fridge. You two are girls.

617
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,242
I'll have tea now.

618
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:57,666
I'll boil water.

619
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,212
I'll bring you our selection.

620
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:12,862
Hope ye took much pleasure in Kajagoogoo.

621
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:16,093
Methinks Oingo Boingo wilst soon makest an appearance.

622
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:19,488
But first, please clear the floor for our happy couple... eth.

623
00:33:42,035 --> 00:33:44,397
Yeah, I'd love to see you juggle sometime. I'm a big fan of juggling.

624
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:50,065
- He... he juggles for money. 
- You okay?

625
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:52,251
- Yeah, yeah. 
- We okay?

626
00:33:52,385 --> 00:33:54,878
Yeah, I didn't mean to get so defensive.

627
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:57,719
I didn't mean to make fun of Jess and what he was reading.

628
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,565
Maybe it's good that he had it. You know, maybe -- he's trying.

629
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:05,101
It's okay. I mean, that book does sound pretty dorky.

630
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:09,727
Liz and T.J. wouldst enjoy others to join them in their modest wriggles.

631
00:34:10,196 --> 00:34:13,391
Oh, hey, so your food's probably cold. You want to go get some more?

632
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,844
Sure, or we can... you know.

633
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:18,225
We can... do what?

634
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,103
You want to dance?

635
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:23,550
- Really? 
- Yeah.

636
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,429
- You said before you don't dance. 
- Well, I'm a compulsive liar.

637
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:32,678
Okay, yeah, let's dance.

638
00:35:53,514 --> 00:35:54,170
Dean.

639
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,461
- Oh, thank God, a friendly face. 
- What happened here?

640
00:35:58,946 --> 00:36:02,161
- Oh, I feel so stupid. I was on this date. 
- Oh, yeah?

641
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:05,116
It was a boy that Grandma saw in diapers.

642
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,570
And she brought him over, and I tagged along on this stupid outing tonight.

643
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:12,395
- He was in diapers? 
- No, she knew him when he was a little kid.

644
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:16,037
So it was this whole big group of people, and they were all drinking in the car, smoking.

645
00:36:16,164 --> 00:36:20,036
And I just thought, "These are, maybe, the last people on earth

646
00:36:20,118 --> 00:36:23,415
- that I would want to die in a car crash with." 
- Well, I'm glad you cut it short.

647
00:36:23,563 --> 00:36:25,171
Poor Grandma. It's not her fault.

648
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,727
She was just thinking I was lonely, and diaper boy was nice

649
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:30,321
and doing her matchmaker thing. Did I say that I feel stupid?

650
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:32,185
No, that's okay. It's cool.

651
00:36:32,427 --> 00:36:35,432
- And hungry. I haven't eaten since breakfast. 
- Well, then, let's eat.

652
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:37,218
- I have no money. 
- I've got money.

653
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:41,269
- Excuse me, we'd like to order. 
- These are your menus right here.

654
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:42,697
Oh, duh, sorry.

655
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:44,884
- This going on your tab? 
- What?

656
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,029
That card at the counter? It's still open.

657
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:50,726
- Put your wallet away, and I hope you're hungry. 
- I can eat.

658
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:54,165
We will start with the sampler appetizer platter...

659
00:36:54,786 --> 00:36:56,566
- This was fun. 
- Yeah, it was.

660
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,884
So, hard to figure out which part of the evening was my favorite.

661
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:02,138
There were a few.

662
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:05,870
T.J. throwing his tights at the bachelors instead of Liz's garter?

663
00:37:05,946 --> 00:37:07,831
- You ducked well, by the way. 
- Pure self-defense.

664
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:11,519
Ooh, the choking guy being Heimliched by the court jester?

665
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,486
That was good.

666
00:37:12,623 --> 00:37:15,977
Or... the minister making out with crazy Carrie?

667
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,736
T.J.'s brother making out with crazy Carrie? Or that last guy making out with crazy Carrie?

668
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,701
- Who was that guy? 
- I think that was her husband.

669
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:22,941
Poor Barry!

670
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,267
- And it might be the dance. 
- Really?

671
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,400
- Have you been taking lessons? 
- That was all God-given talent.

672
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:33,883
- It was fun. 
- Yeah, it was.

673
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:37,123
- Well, good night. 
- We should do it again.

674
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:39,827
What, you got another wedding coming up?

675
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:42,443
Nah, I meant have fun. You know, like a movie or something.

676
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:46,360
- I didn't think you were a movie guy. 
- I can be a movie guy. You like movies.

677
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:48,446
Yeah -- good, bad, and in-between.

678
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:50,963
- How 'bout next week? Sunday? 
- Sunday?

679
00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:53,451
- Sunday -- you free? 
- I think so.

680
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:57,102
- Okay, good. Good. 
- Good. Good.

681
00:37:57,245 --> 00:37:59,984
I'll see you... before then, but I'll see you then, too.

682
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:01,772
Yeah, I'll see you both of those thens.

683
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,463
- You leaving? 
- Just hanging around, see if I'd catch you.

684
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:16,594
Good, I'm glad you did.

685
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,148
You can stay a couple more days, if you want. There's no rush.

686
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:22,421
- Gotta get back to work. 
- Right, right.

687
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,396
- Did you say "goodbye" to your mom? 
- Yeah, we're good.

688
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:28,196
I gave her a cellphone number that's pretty permanent. Just got it.

689
00:38:28,468 --> 00:38:30,197
- Left it for you on the fridge. 
- Good.

690
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:39,629
- I want to pay you back... all the money. 
- You don't have to.

691
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:44,012
- I want to. And I appreciate it... everything...

692
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:49,788
- the money, living here. 
- Well, it's good to hear, but I kind of knew that.

693
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:55,111
Yeah, but, in a relationship -- any relationship --

694
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,513
it's important to let the other person know you appreciate them

695
00:38:57,651 --> 00:39:02,880
so you don't create barriers that delay any hope for reciprocation.

696
00:39:03,514 --> 00:39:05,101
- I think I read that somewhere. 
- Yeah?

697
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,461
You're hoping for reciprocation?

698
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,289
You got it.

699
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:14,107
I'm here, Jess. I'm always here.

700
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:17,758
Thanks.

701
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,772
- The tie work out? 
- The tie was perfect.

702
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:48,341
It's only hitting me now. My classes are done -- done.

703
00:39:48,438 --> 00:39:53,005
I don't have to think about Chaucer or Euclid or Kafka or Machiavelli for months.

704
00:39:53,117 --> 00:39:57,183
I can just think about Jane magazine and why did Uma wear that dress -- fun stuff like that.

705
00:39:57,393 --> 00:40:01,002
You'll still think about Kafka... and probably Chaucer.

706
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:04,289
Probably. But those other two bozos are history.

707
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,635
You hear me? History!

708
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,616
- See in there? 
- Yeah.

709
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:09,133
First semester poli sci.

710
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:11,975
- Which was your seat? 
- Oh, we didn't have assigned seats,

711
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:14,545
but I usually sat with my back to the window so I wouldn't get distracted.

712
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,593
This campus is huge.

713
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,110
And you're seeing it at a weird time 'cause we're probably the last two people left.

714
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:27,539
Man, it's good to get out. It's good to laugh. I laughed tonight. You're funny.

715
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,833
- I can be funny. 
- That's what I just said.

716
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:32,855
- Yeah, but you said it like I never am. 
- You're funny.

717
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,573
- Yeah? Well, this is my room. 
- I know.

718
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,959
- Oh, right, you've been here before. 
- Yeah.

719
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,923
- Well, thanks for saving me. 
- Yeah, anytime.

720
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:53,764
Dean, how is it that you can be out like this,

721
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:57,071
here, with me, or with anyone, for that matter?

722
00:40:58,762 --> 00:41:00,165
Where does Lindsay think you are?

723
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:01,798
She thinks I'm out.

724
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:04,117
- Out where? 
- Doesn't matter.

725
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:07,317
What's going on with you?

726
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:12,013
What are you doing here?

727
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:15,739
- I need to talk to you. 
- Jess...

728
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:18,039
- I need to talk to you. 
- What's going on?

729
00:41:18,136 --> 00:41:19,667
- What are you doing here? 
- Rory, please.

730
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:20,415
Rory?

731
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,173
Go... go home.

732
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:27,828
- No. 
- Yes, go. You should go.

733
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:35,197
Why won't you leave me alone? You won't go away.

734
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:36,471
- Rory. 
- What do you want?

735
00:41:36,598 --> 00:41:40,562
I don't know. I just wanted to see you, talk to you. I just...

736
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:41,934
What?

737
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:43,762
Come with me.

738
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:46,280
- What? 
- Come with me.

739
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,754
- Where? 
- I don't know... away!

740
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:51,437
- Are you crazy? 
- Probably. Do it. Come with me.

741
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:53,470
- Don't think about it. 
- I can't do that.

742
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,065
You don't think you can do it but you can. You can do whatever you want.

743
00:41:56,142 --> 00:41:58,252
- It's not what I want. 
- It is. I know you.

744
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:00,324
- You don't know me! 
- Look, we'll go to New York.

745
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,567
We'll work, we'll live together, we'll be together. It's what I want.

746
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,179
- It's what you want, too. 
- No!

747
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:07,693
I want to be with you, but not here.

748
00:42:07,883 --> 00:42:11,358
Not this place, not Stars Hollow. We have to start new.

749
00:42:11,635 --> 00:42:16,224
- There's nothing to start! 
- You're packed. Your stuff is all in boxes.

750
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:20,002
It's perfect. You're ready. And I'm ready. I'm ready for this.

751
00:42:20,078 --> 00:42:22,699
You can count on me now. I know you couldn't count on me before,

752
00:42:22,777 --> 00:42:25,438
- but you can now. You can. 
- No!

753
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:27,636
Look, you know we're supposed to be together.

754
00:42:27,738 --> 00:42:31,086
I knew it the first time I saw you two years ago, and you know it, too.

755
00:42:31,163 --> 00:42:34,880
- I know you do. 
- No, no, no, no, no!

756
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:38,081
Don't say "no" just to make me stop talking or make me go away.

757
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:41,091
Only say "no" if you really don't want to be with me.

758
00:42:41,547 --> 00:42:42,483
No!
