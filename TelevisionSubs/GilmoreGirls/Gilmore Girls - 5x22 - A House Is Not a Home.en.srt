1
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:05,410
Hi. Hello. Yes,

2
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:06,936
I'm here to pick up my daughter.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,998
Your daughter's name?

4
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:11,485
Rory Gilmore. Lorelai Gilmore. She goes by Rory. I don't know what you have her under.

5
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:12,458
Rory Gilmore.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,973
Oh, that's good, because she only answers to that.

7
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:15,754
Not that she won't to the other, but -

8
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:16,606
She'll be out in a minute.

9
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:17,933
Okay. Thanks.

10
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,823
Sorry, when you say she'll be out, do you mean out of a cell?

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,630
Yep.

12
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,720
So she was -

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,350
in a cell.

14
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,552
That's where we usually put people when they're arrested.

15
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,298
Was she in the cell alone?

16
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,991
It was a slow night. She had the place to herself.

17
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:33,332
Oh, that's good.

18
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:36,286
I mean, not that she's a snob. She can get along with anyone, it's just,

19
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:38,103
it was her first time in a cell,

20
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,968
so I didn't want her to be attacked, you know, like in Caged Heat?

21
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,198
Or was it Switchblade Sisters? Anyway.

22
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,726
I mean, my daughter never gets into trouble.

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,456
Except, you know,

24
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:47,230
now.

25
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,565
But on the whole, the kid is an angel.

26
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:50,881
She goes to Yale.

27
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:52,153
She'll be out in a minute.

28
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:52,463
Right.

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,384
I'm sorry. Are you, like, solving something?

30
00:00:57,926 --> 00:00:58,667
What can I do for you?

31
00:00:58,895 --> 00:00:59,769
I was just wondering.

32
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:01,263
Is Rory in the system now?

33
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:05,378
Because I just remember when Sipowicz's son accidentally got arrested

34
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,715
because he looked like a drug dealer.

35
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:09,580
Sipowicz was freaked out that the son was going to wind up in the system.

36
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:13,809
And I just wonder, you know, should I be freaked out? And also, what exactly is the system?

37
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:14,752
She's got to go to court.

38
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:15,947
They'll figure out what's going to happen.

39
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,292
And am I going to have to pay anything? I mean,

40
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,929
bail? Does she need
bail?

41
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,233
They're releasing her on a P.T.A.

42
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,074
A promise to appear.

43
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:25,182
Oh, she will. She will appear. She might be there before you will.

44
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:25,973
I won't be there.

45
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,363
Right. But she will, 'cause she promised.

46
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:29,635
I'll be over there.

47
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:37,020
Well.

48
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:39,382
This is much nicer than the last place we picked him up from.

49
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:42,081
Yes, we definitely need to keep this one in mind for future infractions.

50
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:43,268
Excuse me, Officer,

51
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:47,221
we were wondering if one Logan Huntzberger has been released from your fine custody yet?

52
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,356
Nope. Have a seat.

53
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:49,330
We'll be over here.

54
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:51,741
And if you have a moment we'd like to order some appetizers.

55
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:53,948
So typical.

56
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,776
Logan would have to get busted during the one time I almost got Rosemary to agree to go home with me.

57
00:01:57,794 --> 00:02:00,426
It's vintage Huntzberger, my friend. Friday nights end in jail.

58
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:01,853
The boy knows how to party.

59
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,127
Stealing Richardson's boat. Genius.

60
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:05,322
Let's not forget the lovely Rory.

61
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:07,534
Yes. Maxwell Smart finally found his Ninety-Nine.

62
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:08,906
Rory Gilmore is coming out now.

63
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,189
Oh, thank you.

64
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,559
You're here for Rory?

65
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:12,356
Yeah.

66
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:14,093
Oh, well, we would have taken her home.

67
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:15,453
Just so you know she was covered.

68
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:16,839
Wow. The relief.

69
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,122
I'm Colin.

70
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:19,361
This is Finn. And you are?

71
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,102
Her mother.

72
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:21,650
My God, those are good genes.

73
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:32,343
You've got everything?

74
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,529
Let's go.

75
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:40,284
"A House is not a Home"

76
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,786
What's on your hands?

77
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:05,651
Fingerprints.

78
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,742
Right.

79
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:14,124
Do you want to go in and eat, or take it home?

80
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:14,688
Home.

81
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:15,982
Okay.

82
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,140
We're having a bike race.

83
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:22,820
Bike race through town, first one ever.

84
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:23,948
Taylor's really excited.

85
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:25,298
Maybe Sheryl Crow will come.

86
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:25,984
Maybe.

87
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:27,524
Probably not.

88
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:32,058
I'm running out of small talk, kid.

89
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:34,238
Got to get around to the main event here soon.

90
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,775
I know.

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,727
Rory,

92
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:37,523
what happened?

93
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:40,329
No, don't answer it.

94
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,435
It's Logan.

95
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:41,911
Rory,

96
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:42,663
don't answer it.

97
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:43,393
I have to.

98
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,260
Well, I don't want you talking to him right now.

99
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,902
Why not?

100
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:46,411
Why not?

101
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:47,627
He just got you arrested.

102
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:48,568
He did not.

103
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:49,464
Don't protect him.

104
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:50,618
It was my idea!

105
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:51,680
Oh, come on.

106
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,230
Logan was at his sister's engagement party

107
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:57,350
having a perfectly lovely time when I showed up and dragged him off.

108
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:59,949
He spent the night in jail because of me. I have to take this call

109
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:01,353
Hey.

110
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:02,415
Are you okay?

111
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:06,441
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. I was just worried about you.

112
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:09,225
Lorelai.

113
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:10,541
Yoo-hoo!

114
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:12,206
Behind you!

115
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:13,147
Back here!

116
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:14,153
Turn around!

117
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:15,403
Turn around,
turn around!

118
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:16,908
Yes, Taylor.

119
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,465
You know we have a race coming through here tomorrow.

120
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,368
Uh, yeah, it says it on the banners.

121
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,656
The fifth annual Connecticut Bike Race.

122
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,336
It's a very prestigious race.

123
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:26,956
Oh, I'm sure.

124
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:30,716
Now, I don't know if you've noticed the no parking signs I've been putting out.

125
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:31,551
I didn't, Taylor.

126
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:34,787
I swear, if something doesn't have a Marc Jacobs label on it,

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,406
you
girls just don't notice it.

128
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:36,726
Well,

129
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,088
I have just put no parking signs all up

130
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:40,174
and down the street here,

131
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:44,013
in hopes of clearing a safe and unobstructed path through Stars Hollow.

132
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:45,382
Well, what a super goal, Taylor.

133
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:46,256
Thank you.

134
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,467
Now, if you notice,

135
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:51,912
your Jeep is currently parked in what is about to become a no parking zone.

136
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:52,472
Really.

137
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,290
As of ten o'clock tonight.

138
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:57,066
At 10:01, we will be towing.

139
00:05:57,328 --> 00:05:58,660
I'm coming for you!

140
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,953
Okay, Taylor, it's nine fifty-five. I still have six minutes.

141
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:03,343
Yes, but it would be easier if you would just move the car now.

142
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:06,082
If it's easy then anyone could do it, and I'm a maverick.

143
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:10,091
Look what Jane Fonda hath wrought.

144
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,220
Rory stole a yacht. How's your night been?

145
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:15,950
What?

146
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,630
What do you mean, Rory stole a yacht?

147
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:23,654
I, uh, just got back from picking Rory up from the Bridgeport police department

148
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,659
where she was brought following her arrest for grand theft boating.

149
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:29,682
Tell me what happened.

150
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:32,259
I don�t know what happened. I haven�t gotten the details yet.

151
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:35,458
I did get a piece of paper with a court date on it, though. June third.

152
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,689
Sounds
like a good day to go to court, don�t you think?

153
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:38,884
Was she with that Logan kid?

154
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,303
Yes, he was arrested too.

155
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:42,546
Well, there you go. He got her into this.

156
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:44,451
That�s what I said. I need hand soap.

157
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:44,948
What?

158
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:47,988
Oh, she got ink all over her hands from the fingerprinting and I�m out of soap.

159
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:48,860
I have soap.

160
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:51,324
Maybe she needs special soap. Is there special soap?

161
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:53,317
Is it special ink? It must be special ink, right?

162
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:53,790
I don�t -

163
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:57,525
I mean, of course. They�re not going to use normal ink for fingerprinting,

164
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:59,658
it�s supposed to brand you and humiliate you.

165
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,117
Normal ink wouldn�t humiliate you, unless you�re Rory and your mother has no soap.

166
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,000
What are you doing?

167
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,780
I should make a list. I�m going to forget things. I just need a pen.

168
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:07,290
Here.

169
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:10,016
Okay, so, okay. Buy soap.

170
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,631
Let�s see, what else? Buy soap, buy soap,

171
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:13,865
uh, get lawyer -

172
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,749
I can help you with a lawyer.

173
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:16,419
Oh, crap, Rory�s car!

174
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,547
It must still be at the marina. She�s going to have to pick it up.

175
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:19,817
If it hasn�t been impounded!

176
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,276
How do I find out if it�s been impounded?

177
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:23,093
I�m sure you can call down there, and -

178
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,533
God, every ten seconds something else pops into my head.

179
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:27,512
I�m just
not prepared for this. I mean,

180
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,267
Rory never even shoplifted.

181
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:31,259
Not a candy bar, not a lipstick.

182
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,442
She forgot to return a library book once.

183
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:36,019
And she was so guilty about it that she grounded herself.

184
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:36,965
I mean, can you imagine?

185
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:40,365
She�s just sitting there in her bedroom yelling at me,

186
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:43,453
Now no one else got to read the Iliad this week because of me!

187
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:44,725
What can I do?

188
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,120
Rory hasn�t eaten.

189
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:47,688
I can make you some burgers.

190
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,796
No, no, no. Just donuts. We need to get home and get to the bottom of this.

191
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:54,663
Okay. This is not the end of the world, right?

192
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,783
I mean, Rory�s young.

193
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:58,634
Young people do stupid things. I got pregnant.

194
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:01,073
This is better, it�s not so permanent.

195
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,715
Unless it�s on her permanent record, and then, oh, God, does that mean she can�t vote?

196
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:04,636
Oh, I don�t think -

197
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:06,665
I thought I read that if you commit a felony you can�t vote.

198
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:07,163
I think that�s -

199
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:08,010
Rory loves to vote!

200
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:11,211
She switched her �I voted� sticker from outfit to outfit this year,

201
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,402
and then she scotch taped it to her purse!

202
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:14,800
She has to
be able to vote!

203
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:17,078
You want me to come with you when you talk to her?

204
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:19,617
No. Thanks, she�s in the car. I should go. Thanks for the
donuts.

205
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:21,011
Yeah. Sure.

206
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:31,358
Kirk just came by and gave us a two minute warning.

207
00:08:31,463 --> 00:08:32,596
Any idea what he�s talking about?

208
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:35,552
Who ever has any idea what Kirk�s talking about? Here.

209
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:36,380
Thanks.

210
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:38,870
Rory, what happened tonight?

211
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:40,389
I stole a yacht.

212
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:43,626
Yes, I know. The nice men with the guns told me. Why?

213
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:44,424
I just -

214
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,144
I was really upset and I felt like I had to do something.

215
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:50,850
Okay, sure, I get that.

216
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,548
But when I�m upset and I need to do something I eat a lot of pound cake.

217
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:54,985
They don�t have pound cake at Yale?

218
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:56,828
No, they have pound cake at Yale.

219
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:03,538
Mitchum Huntzberger talked to me today.

220
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,408
About my performance.

221
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,142
And?

222
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:10,835
And he said that I was very smart and competent and would someday make

223
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:14,523
someone a great assistant.

224
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,420
Uh-huh.

225
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:18,670
But as a journalist, he just doesn�t think I have it.

226
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:19,392
It?

227
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,023
Who is he, Louis B. Mayer?

228
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:24,462
No, he says he has like a sense for this kind of thing. I just -

229
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,308
I don�t know, it was a surprise. I mean, I thought I was doing really well.

230
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:29,430
I thought I was impressing him.

231
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:32,679
I thought he was going to offer me a summer job at the paper, I thought -

232
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:33,998
Oh, God, I hate this guy.

233
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:36,492
It�s not his fault. I mean, if he doesn�t think I could be a journalist,

234
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,298
it�s probably best that he tells me before -

235
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,050
Before what?

236
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,660
Before I go out there and fall on my face.

237
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:43,912
But, Rory, he is wrong He doesn�t know what he�s talking about.

238
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:45,057
He does this for a living.

239
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:47,986
Not after I kill him, he doesn�t. Big, fancy, arrogant creep.

240
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:50,115
Handing down these all-knowing proclamations.

241
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,526
I mean,

242
00:09:50,563 --> 00:09:52,965
how the hell does he know if you have �it� or not?

243
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:56,017
Has he seen your writing? Has he talked to you, I mean really talked to you?

244
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,882
Has he talked to any of your teachers? Has he talked to anyone who knows

245
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,187
how much �it� you have?

246
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:02,544
No. He�s spent exactly two weeks with you,

247
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,818
ordering you around, sending you on coffee runs, playing the big shot!

248
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:07,151
He is the publisher!

249
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:10,886
I know what it says on his business card. I�m going to kick his ass.

250
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,846
Should we be at all concerned that Kirk�s trying to tow us away right now?

251
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,342
No. He is not God!

252
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,632
This is one man�s opinion. He did not invent journalism.

253
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:21,172
He�s just a guy with a really good parking space.

254
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:23,114
I�m so, so sorry.

255
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:24,599
I know you are.

256
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:27,735
I was so stupid. I�ll never be that stupid again.

257
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:29,341
Aw. Sure you will.

258
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:31,322
Oh my God.

259
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:33,276
I got arrested.

260
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:35,109
I have to go to court!

261
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:36,889
I have to go get my car.

262
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:40,387
No - do you have soap at home? Because I have all this ink all over my hands, and -

263
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:40,973
Honey.

264
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,218
Relax.

265
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:44,122
We will figure it out.

266
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:06,949
I turned twenty-one in prison, doing life without parole.

267
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:08,942
No-one could steer me right,

268
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:12,782
but Mama tried, Mama tried. Mama tried

269
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,534
to raise me better

270
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:17,036
but her pleading I denied,

271
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,495
that leaves only me to blame, �cause Mama tried.

272
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,302
Leaves only me to blame, �cause Mama tried.

273
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,630
Brian! I need to get in there!

274
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,829
I was only in there fifteen minutes.
I clocked it.

275
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,408
Time, dude?

276
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:39,217
Seven thirty.

277
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,296
Crap. I overslept.

278
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:42,891
You�re saying that like it�s my fault.

279
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:43,887
Shut up.

280
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:45,592
It is your fault.

281
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:47,686
I told you to get a clock you don�t have to wind.

282
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:48,794
I told you to shut up.

283
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:50,499
You never wind it, then you yell at me.

284
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:51,233
Dude,

285
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,136
you keep nagging me, I�m going to have to buy you a ring.

286
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:55,580
I get off work at six.

287
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:56,912
I�ll alert the media.

288
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,891
I mean, that�s early enough to have band practice.

289
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:00,149
Are we having band
practice tonight?

290
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:00,771
Maybe.

291
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,031
I may have to work late.

292
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:02,828
Brian.

293
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:04,110
I have my temp review, Lane.

294
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:06,724
I think they might be ready to offer me the full-time receptionist job.

295
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:07,872
It�s been a while since we�ve practiced.

296
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:09,029
We�ve been busy.

297
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:09,888
Tomorrow, then?

298
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,818
Definitely a conversation to have.

299
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,061
Fine, we�ll talk tonight. Have you seen my jeans jacket?

300
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:16,899
Oh, come on! I threw the troll!

301
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:31,049
Morning!

302
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,663
God, I feel like I could sleep through the entire day.

303
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,808
Coffee will be ready soon.

304
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:35,779
What are you doing?

305
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:36,837
Well,

306
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,667
I�m updating the refrigerator.

307
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:39,927
Where did you get that?

308
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,478
Oh, the nice lady at the police station e-mailed it to me.

309
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:43,924
I thought it would look really nice

310
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:45,563
next to your kindergarten handprint collage.

311
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,263
I got you a copy if you�re thinking Christmas cards.

312
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:48,044
Very thoughtful.

313
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,704
You hungry?

314
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:52,189
I�m starving. I�ve had nothing but donuts for two days.

315
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:53,574
Funny.

316
00:12:53,698 --> 00:12:54,719
Hold on.

317
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:57,808
I�m really glad you�re enjoying this.

318
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:00,248
Rory, the penal system is not something we enjoy,

319
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:02,191
It�s something
with a name that makes us giggle.

320
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:03,638
I assume there�s pop-tarts?

321
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:05,057
Now, what�s on the agenda for today?

322
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:07,895
I hear there�s a shipment of plutonium coming in at the docks,

323
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,631
and I thought we could dress up as nuns and I could distract them with a fake stigmata,

324
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:13,398
you could shove the plutonium under your habit, and -

325
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:15,552
I have to got back to school. I have one last final, plus -

326
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:16,598
Oh, wait.

327
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:25,396
Plus

328
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:29,429
I have one last load of stuff that I need to pick up and transport back here.

329
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:32,130
And now I have to hang up. Visiting hours are over.

330
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:34,483
Thanks for letting me borrow the Jeep.

331
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:37,397
Figured if I didn�t give it to you voluntarily you�d just heist it anyway.

332
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:38,928
This bit�s going to last for a while, huh?

333
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:40,123
Mm. Twenty to life.

334
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:42,961
Time off for a well-placed Tom Sizemore Whizzenator joke.

335
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:45,442
Don�t let the movies fool you, kiddies. Crime doesn�t pay.

336
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:46,363
Listen, uh,

337
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,927
later today I�m going to try and track us down a lawyer. I thought I�d call that guy

338
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,434
who got Robert Blake off, what was his name, Houdini?

339
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:53,710
What?

340
00:13:54,444 --> 00:13:56,288
Where are you really going to get this lawyer?

341
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:58,641
The emergency room.

342
00:13:58,653 --> 00:13:59,836
Ambulance dispatch center?

343
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:00,745
You�re not going to tell -

344
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,205
No.

345
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:03,748
I�m not going to go through Mom and Dad. There�s no reason they need to know about this.

346
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,640
Did I say I�m sorry in the last five minutes?

347
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,201
Hm.

348
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:08,976
I think not slugging me when I pulled out the telephones said it for you.

349
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:09,611
I love you, mom.

350
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,383
I love you, kid.

351
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,315
Hello.

352
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,921
Uh, hi. Is Rory there?

353
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,303
She just left, who�s calling?

354
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:20,249
It�s Logan.

355
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,042
Oh. She�s not here.

356
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,494
I�ve been trying to get her, her phone must be off or dead or something

357
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,295
Well, she�s heading back to school. You can just catch up with her there.

358
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:28,257
Yes, I�ll do that.

359
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:28,904
Okay. Bye.

360
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:32,726
Oh, listen, I�m sorry to call your house. I just had this number and I wanted to talk to Rory.

361
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:33,597
It�s okay, Logan.

362
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:34,756
And listen,

363
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,711
I know you must be really upset by this whole thing,

364
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,586
but I want you to know my father�s lawyers are all over the situation, and -

365
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:40,522
Hey, you know what?

366
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,435
I think your father has done just about enough here, okay?

367
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:44,419
Done enough?

368
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,326
Yes. So, thank your father for this.

369
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:49,064
And I do mean all of this. But
I think I can handle it from here.

370
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:49,500
But -

371
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:51,529
His help isn�t needed, Logan. I�ve got it.

372
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,309
Okay. You got it. Sorry, I was just -

373
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:54,831
Rory should be back at school soon.

374
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:56,338
Right. Sorry to bother you.

375
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,483
No problem. Bye.

376
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:01,367
Hey.

377
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:02,104
What�d he do?

378
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:03,436
What?

379
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:05,813
My father. What�d he do?

380
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:07,546
Who told you that he did anything?

381
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:09,426
I called your house. I talked to your mom.

382
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:10,409
Great.

383
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:17,151
I should have known something happened, the way you showed up at Honor�s party like that.

384
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:17,809
I should have known.

385
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:19,339
My mother shouldn�t have said anything.

386
00:15:19,364 --> 00:15:20,584
She didn�t say anything specific.

387
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:21,592
Then what�d she say?

388
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,111
Rory, just tell me what happened.

389
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,693
It�s stupid. I feel stupid.

390
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:25,428
Rory.

391
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,295
I overreacted. You�ll think I�m three.

392
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:28,204
Tell me.

393
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,862
He just -

394
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:34,231
doesn�t think that I�ve got what it takes to be a journalist.

395
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:36,500
He says he knows when someone has it,

396
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,417
and I apparently do not have it.

397
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:39,176
He said that to you?

398
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:39,637
Yeah.

399
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:40,708
Just like that.

400
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:41,803
Pretty much.

401
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:45,664
I knew it. I knew this was going to happen. I didn�t want you to take that internship.

402
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:48,591
I had to take the internship. Your father�s the top guy in the business.

403
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,342
My father is a jackass! He�s a bully!

404
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:53,285
He has zero interest in
people�s feelings.

405
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,812
It�s always just say what you feel, right or wrong, who the hell cares who you hurt.

406
00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:57,160
Whatever. I�m going over there right now.

407
00:15:57,185 --> 00:15:58,106
Logan, no.

408
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,347
You�re my girlfriend, Rory, he should have treated you better than that.

409
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:01,704
I don�t want you to say anything!

410
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:02,587
I have to!

411
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:03,498
Logan, no!

412
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,884
Please! I just want to forget this. I just want it to go away!

413
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,747
And please don�t make a big thing between you and your dad, I don�t want that!

414
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:10,285
Rory.

415
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,377
Don�t put me in that position, please.

416
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:17,282
I�m sure he�ll give me a crappy present for my birthday.

417
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,897
Maybe I can pick a fight with him over that.

418
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,737
Thank you.

419
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,932
You should have told me.

420
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:22,202
I didn�t want to tell you.

421
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:22,874
Hey.

422
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:25,949
If this relationship thing is going to work, then it goes both ways.

423
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:28,155
You have to tell me why were committing a felony before we do it.

424
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:30,765
Not that that�s going to stop us, but at least I�ll have all the facts, okay?

425
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,165
Okay. I�m sorry.

426
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,074
Come here.

427
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:39,522
You need some help packing?

428
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:40,733
No.

429
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,460
I�ve got my last final today.

430
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:45,352
I should go over my notes.

431
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:47,020
Okay. Call me after.

432
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:47,881
I will.

433
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,163
You�re good?

434
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:49,973
I�m good.

435
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:51,591
Okay.

436
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:52,811
Oh,

437
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:55,213
and try and talk to your mother.

438
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,018
My father�s lawyers should really handle this thing. They�ve had a lot of practice,

439
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:58,528
believe me.

440
00:16:58,565 --> 00:16:59,897
Okay. I�ll talk to her.

441
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:05,800
Big hole!

442
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:06,833
Big hole!

443
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:08,265
Big hole!

444
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:09,423
Big hole!

445
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:11,963
You, uh, signed on the wrong line.

446
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,197
Oh, sorry.

447
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:15,450
Cross it out, initial it, and sign again.

448
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:16,372
Big hole!

449
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,364
What the hell is wrong with them?

450
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:21,227
Why can�t they just let the bozo in back of them figure out for himself

451
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:22,313
there�s a big hole there!

452
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:25,362
You�re awfully crabby for a man whose business is booming because of this race.

453
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,445
I don�t want this kind of business. It�s too shiny.

454
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,681
I myself am finding the whole thing rather intoxicating.

455
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,168
Our little town, the site of an international sports event like this?

456
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:37,069
You have no idea
how much wrangling it took to get them here.

457
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:37,604
Big hole!

458
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:40,380
Ah, geez. I smudged! He made me smudge!

459
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:43,296
Cross it out, initial the smudge, then start again.

460
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:48,089
I lobbied the race coordinators for weeks. It was a lot of ouzo and karaoke,

461
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:51,813
but I bagged our town the coveted first stop, last stop slot.

462
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,795
Wait, first stop, last stop meaning -

463
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,836
They start here today, circle the state,

464
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,455
then end here later this week.

465
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:59,312
Every one of them will be coming back.

466
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:00,706
Big hole!

467
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:02,225
Unbelievable.

468
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,988
Uh, don�t press too hard, there, buddy, I don�t want to start all over again.

469
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:06,246
That�s the last one.

470
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:07,282
Excellent.

471
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:11,403
Well, I guess congratulations are in order, Luke. You�ve just bought yourself the Twickham house.

472
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:12,311
Thank you, Taylor.

473
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:15,202
Now, remember, there�s a three day cooling-off period,

474
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:17,355
meaning you have three days from today to change your mind.

475
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:18,849
I�m not going to change my mind.

476
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:24,192
Well, it�s been a pleasure doing business with you, Luke! I certainly hope it works out for you and your future plans.

477
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,150
Big hole!

478
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:26,622
I�m taking my break!

479
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:28,053
I have fifteen minutes.

480
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:29,260
No chili?

481
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:29,945
Where�s Gil?

482
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,116
It totally needs some chili.

483
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,292
Gill called. His delivery boy didn�t show so he has to make some stops on the way.

484
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:35,437
He said he may not be able to make it.

485
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,259
Of course he can�t make it. Why should he make it? I mean, it�s only a band meeting, right? Nothing important.

486
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,166
Oh, my God, I can taste the potato!

487
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:41,490
So?

488
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,979
So I hate the potato. The chili hides the potato.

489
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:44,589
Zach!

490
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:45,423
Nice screech.

491
00:18:45,463 --> 00:18:48,949
This right here, this attitude! It�s exactly what I�m talking about.

492
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,393
What do you mean, what you�re talking about?

493
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:51,476
You haven�t said anything
yet.

494
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:52,562
I think we have a problem.

495
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:53,060
We do?

496
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,795
I just got totally boned by this sixteen year old Three Doors Down fan.

497
00:18:56,832 --> 00:18:58,114
My week sucks.

498
00:18:58,151 --> 00:18:59,869
I started the meeting already, Gil.

499
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,341
Gee, sorry Lane.

500
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:03,731
I dropped off the hoagies as quickly as I could.

501
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:05,300
Next time I won�t wait for the money,

502
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:09,906
and my kid can just paint himself silver and do the robot on the street corner for tuition fees.

503
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:10,914
What�s going on here?

504
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,482
Are we breaking up?

505
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:13,135
What?

506
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:14,978
Oh, you mean the band.

507
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:15,675
Okay,

508
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:16,422
cool.

509
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:17,268
Wow.

510
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:17,915
Go on.

511
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,608
We�re not breaking up. Are we breaking up?

512
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:20,422
Well, I don�t know.

513
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,793
It just seems to me that lately the band doesn�t seem to be as important to everyone as it used to be.

514
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:24,403
I don�t agree.

515
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:27,616
We hardly practice anymore. Everyone else has all these other things to do.

516
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:29,459
There were clothes on my drums this morning.

517
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:29,932
Sorry.

518
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,044
After I Woolite that sweater I have to lay it out flat or else it loses its shape.

519
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:34,342
Lane, relax.

520
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:36,085
Things have just been a little crazy lately.

521
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:37,242
Oh, that reminds me.

522
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:39,396
I got offered that full-time receptionist job today.

523
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:40,118
Really?

524
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,964
Welcome to the grind, my friend.

525
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:44,316
They�re giving me a raise and I get to keep the blazer.

526
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:45,586
Awesome blazer!

527
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,127
I�m sorry, does anyone else see what�s going on here?

528
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:50,392
Brian�s talking
about talking a full-time job.

529
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:50,915
So?

530
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:52,943
The band�s supposed to be your full-time job!

531
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:53,392
Lane.

532
00:19:53,409 --> 00:20:00,006
No, no Lane! You have your Americana banjo band, and you have Century 21, and you have a really stupid hat on.

533
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,017
And what do I have, huh?

534
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,892
According to my mother I am going to hell for this. That�s commitment, my friends!

535
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,444
Eternal damnation is what I�m risking for my
rock and roll!

536
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,116
Lane,

537
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,895
calm down. We all care about the band.

538
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:12,011
So I�m just imagining all of this?

539
00:20:14,318 --> 00:20:15,376
I think we need to play more.

540
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,828
We�ve played every club around here a hundred times.

541
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:19,297
Well, then maybe we need to tour!

542
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:21,912
Tours are rough, Lane. They have to be planned.

543
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:24,315
Venues must be booked,
you need publicity.

544
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,385
Transportation.

545
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,095
Money.

546
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:27,168
Well, we have to do something.

547
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:27,989
Big hole!

548
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:30,130
That�s it!

549
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:34,428
Big bat! Big bat! Big bat!

550
00:20:34,577 --> 00:20:36,233
Six hundred lunges every night.

551
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:36,942
Impressive.

552
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:37,938
Thank you!

553
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:39,718
We are booked, booked, booked.

554
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:41,178
I now love bike riders so much,

555
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,576
that from now on when driving I will no longer consider how many points I�d get if I took them out.

556
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:45,049
What�s this?

557
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,220
This is for you, apparently.

558
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,783
A present? I love presents! I wonder who it could be from?

559
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:50,969
Lorelai,

560
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:55,509
a little something to make the trip over to the Durham Group a bit more fun. Mike Armstrong.

561
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:56,981
Thank you, Mike Armstrong!

562
00:20:57,018 --> 00:20:59,147
That is the man who wants to buy the inn, no?

563
00:20:59,197 --> 00:20:59,981
Oh, my God!

564
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:01,064
Look at all this stuff!

565
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:03,367
Travel soap, travel candles, a travel blanket,

566
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:06,233
cashmere travel pillow, cashmere socks, oh my God.

567
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:07,193
Every morning try this

568
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:11,238
This is La Mer youth serum. Apparently you put this on before you get on a plane,

569
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:13,567
and by the time you get off you�re Dakota Fanning.

570
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:15,199
Michel, take something! What do you want?

571
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:18,062
The memory of those bikers poking each other in the buttocks

572
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:19,867
�Eternal Sunshine�d out of my mind.

573
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,283
Come on, Michel, take something. You love products.

574
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:23,906
You�re going to do it, aren�t you?

575
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:24,329
Do what?

576
00:21:24,354 --> 00:21:26,445
You�re going to sell the inn to Mike Armstrong.

577
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:28,213
Ooh, Euros. Cool.

578
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,105
You�re going to sell the inn to Mike Armstrong,

579
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,481
and then you�re going to go off and have a wonderful life and I�m going to be unemployed.

580
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:35,946
A
very attractive asset on the dating scene.

581
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:38,659
You know, we have our own little section at Match. com.

582
00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:41,138
Michel, stop it. I�m probably not going to take the deal.

583
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:42,034
You�re not?

584
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:44,126
This is my inn. I love it here.

585
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:44,915
It�s just -

586
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:49,519
fun being wooed, you know? Having someone want you enough to send you Prescriptives misting lotion.

587
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,586
Fine. If you say so.

588
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,181
Oh, hey, did the handyman get here yet?

589
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:54,688
That loose banister�s making me nervous.

590
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,405
He has not come. Should I call him again?

591
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:57,490
No. Forget it.

592
00:21:57,527 --> 00:22:00,179
I�ll call Luke. He�ll come fix it, and all it�ll cost me is my honor.

593
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:02,843
Hm. What a lovely arrangement you two have.

594
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:08,386
And the countdown continues. Twenty-five more minutes, people.

595
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:12,431
Can you stand the excitement? I know I can�t.

596
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,049
I�ve only got ten minutes. What do you need?

597
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,747
Oh! The banister�s loose upstairs.

598
00:22:35,748 --> 00:22:36,283
Okay.

599
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:37,652
The window in room three is stuck.

600
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:40,403
The barn door�s off its tracks again, and ooh, hey, did you bring your jackhammer?

601
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,172
Did you hear the part about I�ve only got ten minutes?

602
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:43,267
Window in room three is stuck.

603
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:43,977
Let�s go.

604
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:47,252
But, if you fix it really quickly, the banister is right on your way back down,

605
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:49,518
so really you might as well take a look at that, too.

606
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,526
What�s all this stuff?

607
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:52,107
That is my big, fancy present.

608
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,647
From who?

609
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:53,904
From Mike Armstrong.

610
00:22:54,452 --> 00:22:55,473
Who the hell is Mike Armstrong?

611
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:56,680
He�s my other lover.

612
00:22:56,718 --> 00:22:58,373
He owns a diner in Woodbury.

613
00:22:58,398 --> 00:22:59,718
I didn�t want you
to find out this way, but -

614
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:00,788
The Durham Group.

615
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,830
Yeah, they�re the hotel chain who wants to buy the inn.

616
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:04,090
What are they sending you gifts for?

617
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:06,666
Well, either they�re disproportionately worried about my cuticles,

618
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:09,816
or they can�t live without me and they are begging me to accept their offer.

619
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:10,553
To buy the inn.

620
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,320
Yeah. They�ve been after me ever since that meeting.

621
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:12,831
What meeting?

622
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,125
The meeting with Mike Armstrong.

623
00:23:14,152 --> 00:23:15,870
I didn�t know you had a meeting with Mike Armstrong.

624
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:16,406
Yes, you did.

625
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:16,891
No I didn�t.

626
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,318
Yes you did. You told me to have a meeting with Mike Armstrong.

627
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:21,438
I know, but you never said anything, so I figured it went away.

628
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:22,322
Oh. Well,

629
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:24,301
I had a meeting with Mike Armstrong.

630
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,181
And?

631
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:26,654
And what?

632
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,675
And what happened?

633
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:30,875
Nothing. He talked, I listened. I told him I�d think about it.

634
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,622
Think about it.

635
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:32,181
Yeah.

636
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:33,377
About selling the inn. And then,

637
00:23:33,427 --> 00:23:34,772
after you sell the inn, then what?

638
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,703
I�d be like a consultant for their company.

639
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:37,687
Is that what you want?

640
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:38,409
I don�t know.

641
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,278
Are you going to take this job?

642
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:41,125
Probably not.

643
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:42,121
I�m still mulling.

644
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:43,005
Mulling!

645
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:45,444
You�re still mulling? She�s still mulling!

646
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,032
Why are you so upset?

647
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,696
I�m not upset! I just can�t believe you�re still mulling!

648
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:49,231
Luke!

649
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:50,103
I mean,

650
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,482
you�re seriously considering

651
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,225
selling the inn and taking this job. I mean, where�s their office, anyway?

652
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:56,604
They�ve got a bunch of them. I don�t know where exactly I�d be.

653
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:57,625
Well, shouldn�t you ask?

654
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:58,683
Hello, mulling.

655
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,339
I mean, they could send you anywhere!

656
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:00,712
Luke!

657
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,582
And then there�s all that travel. There�s travel, right?

658
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,814
Yes. No,

659
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,856
I don�t know. What are you freaking out about?

660
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,078
Well, what about the kids?

661
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,584
What kids?

662
00:24:10,352 --> 00:24:10,974
Uh,

663
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:12,082
nothing.

664
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:14,522
Never mind, forget it. I�m going to - Fix the window.

665
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:14,999
Luke.

666
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:16,517
Room three. Got it.

667
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,919
Mama! It�s me, Lane!

668
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:27,936
Over here, in the twenty percent off section.

669
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:30,065
Am I disturbing you?

670
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:32,243
No. But it is past their bedtime.

671
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:33,753
That was a joke.

672
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:34,961
You�re in a good mood.

673
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:36,019
I had a good day.

674
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:37,014
Sell a lot of things?

675
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:38,384
You would like to see my receipts?

676
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:38,844
No.

677
00:24:38,907 --> 00:24:40,039
My inventory reports?

678
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,168
No, Mama, I was just making small talk.

679
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:43,241
You would like some tea?

680
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,361
No, I just -

681
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,602
want to tell you something.

682
00:24:47,413 --> 00:24:48,185
All right.

683
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:50,115
Tell me something.

684
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,391
It looks like the band may be breaking up.

685
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:58,047
We�ve hit a rut.

686
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:01,012
We can�t get enough gigs to get any momentum, and,

687
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:02,779
I don�t know. It�s just not working.

688
00:25:02,944 --> 00:25:03,579
I see.

689
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:05,645
I think I may need to -

690
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,213
move back home.

691
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:11,670
I realize that if you allow me to do that, then I will have to abide by any rules you feel necessary.

692
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:13,267
I also anticipate the words

693
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,694
�Seventh Day Adventist college� will come up, so

694
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:19,317
I�ll go shopping for some Peter Pan collared shirts tomorrow.

695
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:20,999
No more band?

696
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:22,928
No more band.

697
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:27,113
You are not the daughter I raised!

698
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:27,860
What?

699
00:25:27,897 --> 00:25:30,200
Kims don�t give up!

700
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:35,134
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

701
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,068
The inn was swamped. These bikers are like rabbits who don�t eat carrots, too much sugar.

702
00:25:39,107 --> 00:25:40,103
Mm, sugar!

703
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,157
The fitness craze is completely lost on us.

704
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:43,314
I�m starving.

705
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:44,298
Me too.

706
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,516
Hey, so how�d your final go?

707
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,561
It went well.

708
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:48,196
Yeah?

709
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:49,257
And you finished packing?

710
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:52,580
All packed, all boxed. I just have one more trip to school and home and then I�m done.

711
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,659
Ah. It�s going to be nice to have you home for a while.

712
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:55,804
I�m glad you feel that way.

713
00:25:55,832 --> 00:25:58,421
Yeah. The place hasn�t had a decent dusting since you left.

714
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:00,367
Hey, do you think today is the day we�re

715
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:04,136
finally going to go through all twelve layers of the twelve-layer German chocolate cake?

716
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:07,771
The bikers have demonstrated the importance of challenging oneself.

717
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:08,533
Mom.

718
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:10,251
Rory.

719
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:12,581
I have to tell you something.

720
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,377
Okay. Wow, there�s something about Weston�s, it�s always the place where we �talk�.

721
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,525
We could go somewhere else.

722
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:18,633
No, no, no. Tell me.

723
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:23,899
I have decided -

724
00:26:24,262 --> 00:26:27,113
that I�m not going back to
Yale next year.

725
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,216
I�m sorry, I don�t think I heard you correctly

726
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:31,432
I�m not going back to Yale next year.

727
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:32,320
But why?

728
00:26:32,345 --> 00:26:33,166
Because

729
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:35,656
I�m not sure that it�s the right place for me.

730
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:38,780
And I�m not exactly sure what I�m going to do with my life, and

731
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:41,074
Since when are you not sure what you�re going to do with your life?

732
00:26:41,112 --> 00:26:41,560
Mom -

733
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:44,784
You�ve known what you wanted to do with your life since you were three. Be a journalist.

734
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:46,066
Maybe not.

735
00:26:46,427 --> 00:26:49,153
Oh. This is about Mitchum Huntzberger.

736
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,064
No, it�s not.

737
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:53,052
Rory, honey, I know that what he said hurt you, and that shook you
up

738
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,654
and you lost your confidence, but that was just one man�s opinion.

739
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,624
It has nothing to do with what he said to me.

740
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,334
And Mitchum Huntzberger happens to be the top newspaper guy in the country.

741
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:02,232
So what?

742
00:27:02,295 --> 00:27:05,095
So if you�re going to get one man�s opinion, he�s the one man you get.

743
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:07,946
You�re not thinking. This is the man who doesn�t want you to marry Logan.

744
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:11,235
That wasn�t him. It was Logan�s mother and his grandfather.

745
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:12,769
And you really think he�s okay with it?

746
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,788
I mean, his while family looks at you and sees Anna Nicole Smith, and they tell you that to your face,

747
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,780
but he thinks you�re swell and wants to pay for the honeymoon.

748
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:20,487
That�s not why he said what he said.

749
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,782
He�s messing with your mind. He has so many motives that have nothing to do with your abilities!

750
00:27:24,822 --> 00:27:28,121
That�s not true! He said I can�t do it, so I can�t do it!

751
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,951
Why are you so willing to believe this guy?

752
00:27:29,976 --> 00:27:30,909
Logan agrees with him.

753
00:27:30,936 --> 00:27:31,671
He said that?

754
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:33,207
He told you he agrees with has father?

755
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:36,439
Because if that�s so, he�s a fantastic boyfriend. Really, quite a catch.

756
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:38,530
No, he didn�t say it. I could just tell.

757
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:39,078
How?

758
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:39,903
I could tell.

759
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:42,293
He ranted about his father being a jerk,

760
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:44,957
and speaking his mind, but he never said that he was wrong.

761
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:46,738
Rory, come on. What kind of logic is that?

762
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:47,809
It doesn�t matter.

763
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,586
This isn�t about that. I told you. I just need some time.

764
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:51,495
You�re making a mistake.

765
00:27:51,522 --> 00:27:52,331
No, I�m not!

766
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:55,854
This is normal! College kids take breaks like this all the time.

767
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,609
You didn�t go to college, so you don�t understand.

768
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,721
No, I didn�t go to college. I wasn�t lucky enough to go to college.

769
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:02,167
Trust me, this is very normal.

770
00:28:02,205 --> 00:28:03,661
No. You are not quitting Yale.

771
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:04,495
Yes I am!

772
00:28:04,536 --> 00:28:07,611
You�re acting incredibly immature. And I know it�s because you�re hurt,

773
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:10,175
but you have got to get a grip! This is too important!

774
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,930
You�ve been
working towards Yale your whole life!

775
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:12,691
No.

776
00:28:12,753 --> 00:28:15,094
I was working toward Harvard my whole life.

777
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:16,986
Okay, fine. Then go to Harvard. That�s cool.

778
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:18,258
I don�t want to go to Harvard!

779
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:20,499
Then go to Princeton or Stamford or Columbia!

780
00:28:20,511 --> 00:28:21,706
I want time off!

781
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,464
If you leave Yale now, you�ll never go back.

782
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,458
You�ll lose momentum.

783
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:25,815
Momentum toward what?

784
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:28,420
All I�ve been doing is working toward being a journalist!

785
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:32,342
I�m not going to be a journalist, so what momentum am I losing exactly?

786
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:33,337
You don�t want to be a journalist,

787
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:34,607
fine! I don�t care about that!

788
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:38,318
But you stay in school, you take some classes, you figure out what you do want to be!

789
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,864
That�s not what Yale is for!

790
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:41,071
That�s what college is for!

791
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:41,831
Yale�s expensive!

792
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,590
Are you paying?

793
00:28:42,615 --> 00:28:43,511
I don�t want to do that!

794
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:46,750
I don�t want to wander around a school where everyone else is focused and

795
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:48,680
working toward something and I�m just floating!

796
00:28:48,705 --> 00:28:52,153
So what�s the great master plan, then, huh? You�re going to move back home, live in your room,

797
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:54,559
work part-time at the bookstore? Forget it. Not an option.

798
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:55,716
I�ll figure it out.

799
00:28:55,804 --> 00:28:56,463
I�m not hungry.

800
00:28:56,513 --> 00:28:57,820
Look, I�m not going back.

801
00:28:57,882 --> 00:28:58,716
I just wanted you to know.

802
00:28:58,741 --> 00:28:59,687
Message sent.

803
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:04,888
Luke, you were looking for Taylor?

804
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:05,535
Yeah.

805
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:08,398
He�s right outside.

806
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,427
I�ll be back in a minute.

807
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:23,091
Hey, Taylor?

808
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:24,299
Uh, hello, Luke.

809
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:25,641
You said I had three days, right?

810
00:29:25,653 --> 00:29:26,089
Three?

811
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:27,795
For the house. Three days to back out.

812
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,190
Well, I didn�t say that, the law did.

813
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:31,306
Fine, whoever said it, I want out.

814
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:32,065
What?

815
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:34,894
Forget the house! Forget the whole damn thing!

816
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:36,363
I don�t need it anymore.

817
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:37,808
Why,

818
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:39,128
Luke!

819
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,421
I have a lunch with Sunny Kingsman today.

820
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,414
And then I have to stop by the club at four.

821
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:53,325
Some of the girls are having an impromptu birthday cocktail with Melly Rutkers.

822
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:56,499
Though the last thing Melly needs is another excuse for a midday cocktail.

823
00:29:57,844 --> 00:29:59,581
I can stop by the cleaners on my way home

824
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:02,354
if you want to have something pressed for your trip this weekend.

825
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:04,470
Uh-huh.

826
00:30:07,012 --> 00:30:11,356
And then after the cleaners I thought I�d run off with Marshall, the golf instructor at the club.

827
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:13,510
Do you think you could manage to get your own dinner tonight?

828
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:15,252
That�ll be fine, Emily.

829
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:18,803
I wonder who that could be, first thing in the morning?

830
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:23,597
Perhaps it�s Marshall, the golf instructor, unable to wait until after Melly�s party to have you.

831
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:24,680
I know I couldn�t.

832
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:26,524
You do surprise me, Richard Gilmore.

833
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:27,819
Hey, um,

834
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,589
I�m sorry to interrupt your breakfast.

835
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:30,485
Lorelai?

836
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:32,315
Uh, I need to talk to you guys about something.

837
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:33,273
Is everything all right?

838
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:33,921
Well -

839
00:30:34,157 --> 00:30:36,821
Sit down, Lorelai. Davita, bring a coffee cup for my daughter!

840
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:39,165
I have to call the office if this is going to take long.

841
00:30:39,177 --> 00:30:42,140
No, Dad, it won�t, I just, um.

842
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:43,783
I need your help.

843
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,305
Call the office, Richard.

844
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:47,346
No, Dad. I promise, it�ll be quick.

845
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:49,177
Rory�s quitting Yale.

846
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:49,824
What?

847
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,343
What are you talking about?

848
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,090
Thank you.

849
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,177
What do you mean, Rory�s quitting Yale? Why would you joke about something like that?

850
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:56,550
What makes you think I�m joking?

851
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,567
Because Rory would never quit Yale!

852
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,011
This must be one of your bits.

853
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:01,713
You scare us with something horrible,

854
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:04,567
like Rory�s quitting college, and then after we have a heart attack,

855
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:07,197
you tell us you were just kidding. You�re having a sex change operation.

856
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:08,242
Mom. Dad.

857
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:09,861
I�m not having a sex change operation.

858
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,822
I don�t understand this. Rory�s doing beautifully at school. Why would she want to leave?

859
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:17,796
Okay, look. I know you love Logan and the Huntzbergers,

860
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:20,809
and you already have the wedding invitations printed and ready to go,

861
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:23,099
but I have to
tell you these are not good people.

862
00:31:23,124 --> 00:31:24,033
Meaning what?

863
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:28,639
Logan�s mother and grandfather attacked Rory at that dinner they invited her to.

864
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:32,475
They told her she wasn�t good enough to marry into the Huntzberger family,

865
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,641
and she wasn�t who they wanted for Logan.

866
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:35,836
Not good enough?

867
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:39,923
Then Mitchum Huntzberger gave Rory that internship, theoretically to make up for that evening.

868
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,436
He let her work for a while, he built her up, and then he clobbered her.

869
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:46,261
He told her she doesn�t have what it takes to be
a journalist,

870
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:48,653
and she needs to find something else to do with her life.

871
00:31:48,715 --> 00:31:49,350
What?

872
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,190
This happened on Friday night, Mom, that�s why Rory wasn�t at dinner.

873
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:53,385
She was devastated.

874
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,033
Then she went to find Logan at the yacht club, and the two of them stole a yacht!

875
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:58,576
No, stop it! Stop it, right now!

876
00:31:58,605 --> 00:32:01,879
They were arrested and I had to pick Rory up from the Bridgeport police department.

877
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:02,476
Oh, no.

878
00:32:02,514 --> 00:32:04,518
Ever since she got involved with these people,

879
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:05,578
things have been bad.

880
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:10,346
She�s up and she�s down and she should be stronger than this, I know, but she�s young and

881
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:15,563
she�s Rory and she�s come so far, she�s worked so hard. I just don�t want her to lose this.

882
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:18,964
What do you want us to do?

883
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:23,384
Well, I�ve already told her that just coming home and bumming around Stars Hollow is not an option,

884
00:32:23,422 --> 00:32:25,774
and I was thinking Friday night at dinner we could -

885
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:27,770
triple-team her.

886
00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:30,483
I bet between the three of us we could knock some sense into her.

887
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,861
But I really need the two of you to back me up on this.

888
00:32:32,888 --> 00:32:35,278
Well, of course we�ll back you up! This is not happening!

889
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,531
How much trouble is she in with this yacht incident?

890
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:38,913
She�s going to need a lawyer.

891
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,961
I�ll call Charlie Newman.

892
00:32:40,011 --> 00:32:41,829
Are we sure we want to wait until Friday?

893
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:42,812
Should we confront her now?

894
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:46,170
No, I think we should give her a chance to cool off a little, maybe some time

895
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,372
will make her more receptive.

896
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:48,691
I agree with Lorelai.

897
00:32:48,728 --> 00:32:49,824
Give the girl some time.

898
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:50,508
All right.

899
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,703
Friday night it is.

900
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:52,799
Thank you.

901
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:53,546
Just,

902
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:55,027
thank you.

903
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,880
I should get going. Dad has to get to work.

904
00:32:57,905 --> 00:32:59,075
Would you like something to eat?

905
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,474
No.

906
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:01,453
I just got everything I need.

907
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:10,170
Davita, could you come here please?

908
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:14,394
Look at these shoes and tell me,

909
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:16,410
these look like the same color
to you?

910
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:19,448
They�re supposed to be the same color, they were bought at the same time,

911
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,377
they�ve been residing in the same box.

912
00:33:21,428 --> 00:33:23,196
However, on closer examination,

913
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:25,026
one of them seems a little faded.

914
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:25,872
What do you think?

915
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,432
What�s the matter?

916
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,287
I was just asking your opinion.

917
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,934
Davita, stop that shaking right now. This is not a trick question.

918
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,752
I just wanted an opinion from -

919
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,696
oh, for heaven�s sake.

920
00:33:37,318 --> 00:33:38,202
Go back to your work.

921
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,966
So I guess I�ll get that.

922
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:45,787
Rory.

923
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:47,305
Can I come in?

924
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,289
Oh.

925
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:50,169
Well, all right. Come in.

926
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,757
I didn�t expect to see you until dinner tonight.

927
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:55,089
I needed to talk to you.

928
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:56,684
Yes, well,

929
00:33:56,712 --> 00:34:00,555
your grandmother is running some errands and I was just doing some work in the house, so -

930
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:01,043
Well,

931
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:04,416
I assume you�ve heard about everything by now.

932
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:09,534
Yes. Well, I believe I�ve heard some bits and pieces.

933
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:12,347
You know, I really was in the middle of something

934
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:14,791
Can this possibly wait until tonight?

935
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,845
I�ll give you my full attention, I promise.

936
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:24,033
Everything�s falling apart.

937
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:27,818
I messed everything up, I don�t know what to do.

938
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:31,154
Your grandmother should be back any minute.

939
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,325
I can have a maid make us some tea.

940
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,502
I�m so sorry, Grandpa! I�m so sorry about everything!

941
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:41,265
I just, I don�t know what to do. I don�t.

942
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,900
It�s all right.

943
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:50,842
Everything will be all right.

944
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:52,873
Where is she, dude?

945
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:54,218
Don�t know, man. I�m not a warden.

946
00:34:54,255 --> 00:34:56,234
This is the second emergency band meeting in a week.

947
00:34:56,284 --> 00:35:00,193
And time is pressing. I have a ten-pound salami sitting out in the van.

948
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:01,839
Do not giggle.

949
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:04,441
This is not nerdy. This is a job.

950
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,445
Hey, can one of you quiz me on the open house procedures?

951
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,478
Level twelve, dude.

952
00:35:07,516 --> 00:35:08,375
I�ll do it.

953
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:11,067
True or false.

954
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:15,198
Simmering some apple juice and a couple of cinnamon sticks makes a pleasant aroma

955
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:17,665
indicating �home� to prospective buyers.

956
00:35:17,702 --> 00:35:18,213
True.

957
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:20,805
I�d add a little potpourri to the johns, too.

958
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:22,610
Geez!

959
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,556
All boys here?

960
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:24,627
Yes.

961
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,075
Good.

962
00:35:25,486 --> 00:35:26,220
Guys.

963
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:27,913
Guess what.

964
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:30,158
Your mother just took ten years off my life?

965
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:31,900
We are going on tour.

966
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:32,734
We are?

967
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,216
What are you talking about?

968
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:34,913
All of you.

969
00:35:35,274 --> 00:35:36,444
Gather round, please.

970
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:39,695
Do not stand there looking stupid!

971
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:40,442
Move!

972
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:41,625
Okay.

973
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,316
You start at the First Lady of Our Sacred Heart on the fourth.

974
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,196
The Church of the Open Hand on the sixth.

975
00:35:46,283 --> 00:35:48,436
Chapel Hill on the tenth. The big auditorium,

976
00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:49,781
not the Sunday school room.

977
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:51,215
Are you sensing a pattern here?

978
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,282
Well, they do have kind of a horseshoe shape.

979
00:35:53,307 --> 00:35:54,415
It looks pretty well thought out.

980
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,672
No. They�re all churches.

981
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:57,452
Not churches. Theatres in churches.

982
00:35:57,628 --> 00:36:02,334
I have contacts with the entire east coast�s Seventh Day Adventist entertainment circuit.

983
00:36:02,387 --> 00:36:05,337
Dates back to my days in an all-girl Christian tambourine band.

984
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:05,872
What?

985
00:36:05,922 --> 00:36:08,387
I have you booked solid for two months.

986
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:10,565
Families in each town will take you in,

987
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:11,876
feed you, put you up -

988
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:13,059
I don�t know.

989
00:36:13,108 --> 00:36:14,503
This seems a little weird.

990
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:16,482
KIM: Weird? What weird? You need to play,

991
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:19,071
here�s places to play. Nice places. Clean places.

992
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,454
Don�t wear that outfit on stage.

993
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:21,799
It�s my delivery outfit!

994
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:23,492
Lane, tell her I don�t dress like this.

995
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,564
I need to see your songs.

996
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:24,988
Why?

997
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:27,029
To see if you need to make any adjustments.

998
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:28,448
Lyrics must be clean.

999
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,071
Okay,

1000
00:36:29,124 --> 00:36:31,838
that�s where we draw the line. We will not change our lyrics.

1001
00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:32,971
Oh, please.

1002
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,674
Prince made fifty-seven million take home last year.

1003
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:37,990
He didn�t swear, and he mentioned God.

1004
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:38,886
Catch up.

1005
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:40,342
Okay, last problem.

1006
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,438
Transportation.

1007
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:42,671
Hey, what about the van?

1008
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:43,344
What van?

1009
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:44,452
Gil�s delivery van.

1010
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:45,248
You have van?

1011
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:46,906
Yeah. Right outside.

1012
00:36:46,944 --> 00:36:48,076
Full of salami.

1013
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:49,620
Let�s see this van!

1014
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:55,859
Lane!

1015
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:58,685
We can�t go on some crazy Christian crusade tour!

1016
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:03,393
It�s a tour, Zach! It�s a chance to play, to keep our band together. Isn�t that important?

1017
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,633
Who cares where we�re playing? Our music will be out there.

1018
00:37:05,662 --> 00:37:06,894
I think a tour would be kind of neat.

1019
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,442
Brian, if you do a tour right, it could be way more than neat.

1020
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:11,291
Gil, get over here!

1021
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:11,988
Yes, ma�am!

1022
00:37:12,112 --> 00:37:12,872
This is your van?

1023
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,913
Yes. But it�s not really big enough for a tour van.

1024
00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:15,786
What are you talking about?

1025
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:19,943
All twenty-seven girls and their tambourines would fit very nicely in here.

1026
00:37:19,995 --> 00:37:20,941
Legs crossed, of course.

1027
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:21,327
But -

1028
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:24,800
Drums go there, bass goes there, guitars go there, Lane rides up front,

1029
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:27,140
and we get rid of the big salami.

1030
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,794
Pop the hood, I need to check the engine!

1031
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:34,153
Okay, okay! I know. It�s not perfect. It�s not the Festival Express, but

1032
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:36,344
it could be really great.

1033
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,128
What do you say?

1034
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:38,784
I think it�s freaking crazy.

1035
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:42,172
Which also happens to be completely rock and roll. Let�s do it!

1036
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:42,757
Seriously?

1037
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:43,442
Totally!

1038
00:37:43,481 --> 00:37:46,830
Century 21�s been around for over thirty years. I�m sure they�ll be here when I get back.

1039
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:47,527
Zach?

1040
00:37:47,627 --> 00:37:48,050
Well,

1041
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:51,424
geez, Dorothy, if Tinman and Lion are going to go, I guess

1042
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:52,507
I
have to go too.

1043
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:53,618
- Yay!
- Yeah!

1044
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:56,045
Gil, get over here and pop the hood, now!

1045
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,531
Yes, ma�am.

1046
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:57,489
I haven�t got all day.

1047
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:57,962
I�m sorry.

1048
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,029
You�ll need new hoses, spark plugs, oil change.

1049
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,471
Wait, let me write this down.

1050
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:04,276
Hi.

1051
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,766
Can I take your coat?

1052
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:07,478
Thank you.

1053
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,320
Lorelai, we�re in here.

1054
00:38:09,447 --> 00:38:13,766
Oh, hey! I thought I�d come a little early so we could strategize.

1055
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:16,406
Sit down, Lorelai.

1056
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:18,136
Okay.

1057
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,257
Uh, Rory should be here pretty soon, so -

1058
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:25,808
Your mother and I have been talking about the situation.

1059
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:27,788
We have discussed the matter thoroughly,

1060
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:29,655
and we have come to a decision.

1061
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,929
Rory will be taking some time off from Yale.

1062
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,456
She will be moving into the pool house here with us.

1063
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:39,468
We will find her some sort of suitable job

1064
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:41,161
through one of our friends,

1065
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:43,604
and then after a suitable amount of time has passed,

1066
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:46,580
we will revisit the subject of her returning to school.

1067
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:48,783
Where are you going?

1068
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:54,802
I was sitting right here.

1069
00:38:54,852 --> 00:38:59,209
I came in, I sat right here, and we had the conversation, right? I mean, I�m not imagining it, right?

1070
00:38:59,247 --> 00:38:59,732
Lorelai -

1071
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:00,865
I had coffee, you had grapefruit -

1072
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:01,276
Lorelai -

1073
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:04,077
Dad was reading the paper, he had to go, so I said I�d make it quick,

1074
00:39:04,102 --> 00:39:07,214
and we sat here, and we talked about how we were going to stick together

1075
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:09,159
and convince Rory to go back to school!

1076
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:11,300
That did happen, right? I
mean, I�m not completely whacko.

1077
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:12,420
Yes, it did happen.

1078
00:39:12,446 --> 00:39:15,670
I mean, obviously I�m a little whacko, because I came here for help in the first place,

1079
00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:17,064
but I�m not totally delusional!

1080
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,622
There were other things to consider.

1081
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,784
You said you would back me on this! You said you weren�t going to let this happen!

1082
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:23,044
Rory is young.

1083
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:26,305
And I�m sure, once she�s had some time and some space she will change her mind.

1084
00:39:26,343 --> 00:39:27,139
But for now,

1085
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:28,869
this is what she wants to do.

1086
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:29,993
And we need to respect that.

1087
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:33,155
Have you talked to Rory about this? Your great plan, does she even know about it?

1088
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:34,874
Yes! She�s fine with the arrangement.

1089
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,742
So you went to her. Behind my back.

1090
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:38,273
She came to me, Lorelai.

1091
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:40,601
She told me what she wanted in her own words!

1092
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,546
Wow, so that does work occasionally with you, huh?

1093
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,579
This makes sense.

1094
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,758
We don�t want her to move in with Logan, do we?

1095
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,308
And since you don�t want Rory to move back home to Stars Hollow

1096
00:39:48,327 --> 00:39:50,364
it just makes sense that she move in here with us!

1097
00:39:50,378 --> 00:39:50,976
I don�t under -

1098
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,034
To watch her.

1099
00:39:52,071 --> 00:39:53,777
Keep her from getting into trouble.

1100
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:55,323
We can get her back on track!

1101
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,924
You�ll understand that once you calm down and think about it rationally!

1102
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:54,547
This is unacceptable! Completely unacceptable! What time is it?

1103
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:55,419
Ten o�clock.

1104
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:59,157
It�s not! It is not ten o�clock! Is it ten o�clock?

1105
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:00,215
No.

1106
00:41:00,365 --> 00:41:02,980
They were supposed to finish the race at twelve. That�s twelve noon!

1107
00:41:03,017 --> 00:41:06,365
When the sun is out and the press are here and the people are interested in buying t-shirts.

1108
00:41:06,403 --> 00:41:08,980
Nobody buys t-shirts at ten o�clock at night!

1109
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:10,102
Sweatshirts, maybe.

1110
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:13,438
Well, we�re not selling sweatshirts, are we?

1111
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,220
All that planning.

1112
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,135
I finally had to send the marching band home. It was past their bedtimes!

1113
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:22,804
I have never met such soft, whiney six-year-olds in my entire life.

1114
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:26,115
If this was Dickens� day, they all would have been sold to a cobbler by now.

1115
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:27,525
I think I see someone coming.

1116
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,769
Oh, really? At ten-ten they come rolling in, huh?
You�re late!

1117
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:33,823
You�re late! You�re all late! You,

1118
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:35,208
and you, and you!

1119
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,230
Rory dropped out of Yale.

1120
00:41:43,865 --> 00:41:44,624
What?

1121
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:48,495
She dropped out of Yale and she moved in with my parents,

1122
00:41:48,522 --> 00:41:51,846
who I went to for help, and they stabbed me in the back.

1123
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:53,277
Everything we worked for.

1124
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:54,323
All these years.

1125
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:56,165
Her whole future.

1126
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,326
She was supposed to have more than me.

1127
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,824
She was supposed to have everything.

1128
00:42:06,379 --> 00:42:08,084
That was the plan.

1129
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:09,665
We had a plan.

1130
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:13,489
Okay, I�m sorry. I have to jump in here. Uh,

1131
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:16,825
I know you think you have
this thing handled, but I can help.

1132
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:21,458
First off, we call Yale and we tell them
something like, uh,

1133
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:25,926
Rory had a chemical imbalance and she was mentally out of her mind when she told them she was

1134
00:42:25,973 --> 00:42:26,630
dropping out.

1135
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:29,204
And then we get her out of your parents house whatever way we can.

1136
00:42:29,222 --> 00:42:34,472
We lock her up in her room with you, because you can talk anybody into anything.

1137
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:38,109
And if worse comes to worst, we will drive her to school every day

1138
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:41,596
and we will follow her to class and camp out there to make sure she goes.

1139
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:44,803
I�ll take morning classes, you take afternoon classes, or the other way around,

1140
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:46,446
if it works out better for your schedule.

1141
00:42:46,514 --> 00:42:48,829
And I know there�s a few kinks to work out,

1142
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:53,277
the kidnapping thing might be a little problematic but either way, she is not quitting school.

1143
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:56,600
This was her dream. I am not going to let this happen.

1144
00:42:59,055 --> 00:42:59,952
What?

1145
00:43:02,118 --> 00:43:04,047
Luke, will you marry me?

1146
00:43:06,762 --> 00:43:07,422
What?

1147
00:43:07,722 --> 00:43:11,593
