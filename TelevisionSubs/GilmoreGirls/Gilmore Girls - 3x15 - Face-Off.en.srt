1
00:00:02,842 --> 00:00:05,187
So, I have talked to every member of my family

2
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:08,689
and we agreed that you can hold the rooms on my credit card,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,071
but everyone must check out with their own.

4
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:11,956
Got it.

5
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:14,336
Have we gone over the room arrangements yet?

6
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:16,273
Closing in on a hundred and fifty times.

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,788
The Doose clan is very, very particular about their accommodations.

8
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,517
We are light sleepers and are prone to night terrors,

9
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,749
and several of us are very allergic to bed clothing,

10
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:28,965
so it�s very important that we are...

11
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,808
On the first floor or near a fire escape.

12
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,519
Yes, Taylor, I know, it�s all taken care of.

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,007
Taylor, could you just hang on a second? I�ll be right back.

14
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,163
All right, but hurry. I don�t have all day.

15
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:42,934
Hey. You were supposed to bring me a cup of coffee.

16
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:45,330
Yes, I know. I�m sorry, I got distracted.

17
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,093
My fault.

18
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:48,171
Yes, but see, when you left me there, I was alone,

19
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:49,826
and now, look, I�m no longer alone.

20
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:51,213
Taylor found you?

21
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:53,179
Yes, and we�ve since embarked on hour

22
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,307
one hundred millionth of planning the special Doose reunion.

23
00:00:56,717 --> 00:00:58,531
I�m coming back over there right now.

24
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:01,746
Yes, and then you are going to get very sick

25
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:04,381
and be unable to feed yourself so that Mommy will need to take you home

26
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,347
and stay by your side until the Doose reunion is over.

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,189
- Say goodbye to Jess. 
- Bye Jess.

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,223
I�ll call you later.

29
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,225
Oh, limp a little if you can.

30
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:16,149
What malady do I have that makes me limp

31
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:17,762
and lose ability to feed myself?

32
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:19,334
- It�s French. 
- Okay.

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,694
Taylor, listen, we�re gonna need to finish this up a little later.

34
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,119
Rory�s not feeling so good.

35
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:28,724
- Oh no, what�s the matter? 
- It�s French.

36
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:32,401
All right. Well, I think we�re just about done here anyhow.

37
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:37,065
Oh, before I forget, let me give you each one of these.

38
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:41,069
"Stars Hollow Hockey, 2003 semifinalists.

39
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:43,829
Go Minutemen. The future is yours. Bring this button to Doose's

40
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:46,732
for fifty percent off your next purchase of Stove Top Stuffing."

41
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,447
Wow, that�s a lot of words for a tiny button.

42
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:51,741
I expect to see both of you wearing them at the game tomorrow night.

43
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:52,887
We�ll try to make it.

44
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,859
Try to make it? My dear, do you realize

45
00:01:55,012 --> 00:02:00,000
that this is the first time we�ve been in the regional semifinals in forty-three years?

46
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,321
But didn�t we only make it this far

47
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:03,429
because the Litchfield team got food poisoning?

48
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,893
I admit it�s not exactly the plot of Hoosiers,

49
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:07,940
but still it�s very, very exciting.

50
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:10,527
It�s nice that you and your family are so loyal to the home team.

51
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:13,051
Oh, the Dooses have been the backbone

52
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,053
of Stars Hollow High hockey for years.

53
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:19,523
I, myself, was the goalkeeper for our team in the last regional finals.

54
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,429
I did not know that.

55
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:23,317
Oh yes. I was responsible for the game-winning goal.

56
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:25,549
So the puck just ricocheted off your head and into the net?

57
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:26,794
Still counted.

58
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,213
For God�s sake, I was making a joke.

59
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,522
You really got pucked in the head?

60
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,777
No, I was making a joke, too.

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,650
Lorelai, just one more...

62
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:41,372
What a disgrace, making that poor sick girl run.
{111}{000}Wow, you can see the dent.

63
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,312
So, Rory, how are things at Chilton?

64
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,647
Great, great, everything�s great.

65
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:46,713
And Lorelai, things at the inn are good?

66
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:51,443
Oh, Rory, please slow down and chew your food properly.

67
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,452
I�m always telling her that. Pass the butter.

68
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,658
- Pass the peas. 
- Pass the pork.

69
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:56,497
Pass your plate.

70
00:03:57,245 --> 00:04:00,224
I�m sorry, is there a race going on I don�t know about?

71
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:01,480
That was your mother, Richard.

72
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:04,588
She just wanted to make sure that all our towels are Egyptian cotton.

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,072
It�s a simple question.

74
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,295
It�s her fortieth simple question of the day.

75
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:09,809
She�s going to be staying with us, Emily.

76
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,321
She just wants to know she�ll be comfortable.

77
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,282
Yes, because we usually give our guests

78
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,198
the towels we�ve stolen from the Holiday Inn.

79
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:16,548
Great Grandma�s coming to stay with you?

80
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,423
Just for a few days, um, while her floors are being redone.

81
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,357
- So, how�s Gran doing? 
- Yeah, does she miss London?

82
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:23,220
- Not half as much as I do. 
- Emily.

83
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:26,477
I never really truly appreciated the Atlantic Ocean before.

84
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:28,698
Three thousand lovely miles of water.

85
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:30,101
You are talking about my mother.

86
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:31,289
I know that, Richard.

87
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,047
And I�m happy to have her stay here,

88
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:35,601
but must she keep interrupting the one dinner a week

89
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:37,410
that we have with Lorelai and Rory?

90
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:40,344
She knows what time we dine � and why are you two eating so quickly?

91
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:41,955
We�re not eating quickly.

92
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,143
Yeah, you�ve been on the phone for awhile.

93
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,962
It probably just seems like we�ve eaten a lot.

94
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,085
- I wonder who that could be. 
- Emily.

95
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:49,294
Well, aren�t we popular?

96
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:52,242
Richard, perhaps you could get that while I have another

97
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,232
bath sheet versus bath towel debate with your mother.

98
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:58,226
- You�re giving it away! 
- What?

99
00:04:58,336 --> 00:04:59,334
You�re eating too quickly.

100
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,562
What? You said that we had to be out of here by 8:30.

101
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:03,230
Yeah, but I didn�t tell you to broadcast it.

102
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:04,706
I�m eating at the same speed you are.

103
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,294
But you�re eating small bites very fast.

104
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,014
You�ve gotta eat bigger bites at a normal speed.

105
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:10,359
You mean I should risk choking so we can make our Friday night plans?

106
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:11,178
Exactly.

107
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,194
I apologize for that.

108
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:15,095
- Collection agency again? 
- Excuse me?

109
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:16,447
Thank goodness she called.

110
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:18,971
Richard, did you know people actually expect there

111
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:20,758
to be soap in their bathrooms when they...

112
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:28,219
Why are there strange men hauling a mattress up my staircase?

113
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:30,636
- Well, now, Emily... 
- She sent her own mattress?

114
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:31,884
She has a very sensitive back.

115
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,457
She sent her own mattress?

116
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:34,957
I�ll go and supervise.

117
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,650
Well, Mom, it looks like you got a lot going on here.

118
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,494
With the mattresses and the phone calls.

119
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:45,284
Yeah, so we�re just gonna go and get out of your hair.

120
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:46,222
Hold it right there.

121
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:47,783
What is going on with you two?

122
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:50,513
What are you talking about?

123
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,320
You know exactly what I�m talking about.

124
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:55,274
Bolting down your food, leaving before dessert,

125
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:57,615
Rory checking her pager every five minutes.

126
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:58,659
What do you have planned?

127
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:05,392
Fine, we�ll just sit here until one of you feels like filling me in.

128
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,499
- She has a date! 
- So does she!

129
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:14,444
Yeah, but hers starts a half-hour earlier than mine!

130
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,073
Because you get to stay out later!

131
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:17,656
Because I�m the mom!

132
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,253
You two, stop it right now!

133
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,426
You�re behaving like children.

134
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,617
- Sorry. 
- Yeah, sorry.

135
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:25,760
Our deal is for Friday night dinners, not appearances at Friday night dinners.

136
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,245
Now, you will sit there and you will eat your dessert.

137
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:28,863
But...

138
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,850
One more word and I throw in a game of charades.

139
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:32,488
- Yes, ma�am. 
- Yes, Mom.

140
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:35,893
Oh, we gotta get a faster car!

141
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,533
Hey, don�t blame the car.

142
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:39,519
So you�re saying it�s my fault we�re late?

143
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:40,732
Who was the one who said,

144
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,643
"Hey, I�ve got room for another piece of pie."

145
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:45,162
Ah! You kept making all that pointless conversation,

146
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,389
all those thank you�s and please�s.

147
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,183
What, are you running for Miss Congeniality?

148
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,401
Just get ready.

149
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:50,426
What time are you meeting Jess?

150
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:51,506
I don�t know, I�ll tell you in a sec.

151
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:53,135
Have you seen my brown boots?

152
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:55,788
I cannot go out without those brown boots.

153
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:58,775
My entire outfit was retrofitted around those practically �

154
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:01,274
Oh! Wait, can you believe it?

155
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:03,564
Hey, they were in my closet.

156
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,847
What sort of bizarre accident of fate put them there?

157
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:11,583
What?

158
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,324
He didn�t call?

159
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,983
Well, maybe it�s too early.

160
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,883
- What time is it? 
- 9:15.

161
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,040
And when did he say he would call?

162
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:19,616
- When he got off work. 
- Which was when?

163
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,585
It varies.

164
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,921
I�m sorry, I thought you guys had a plan.

165
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:22,766
We did.

166
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,871
And the plan was that he calls you whenever

167
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:26,395
- because his work time varies? 
- Yes.

168
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,782
Good plan. Bay of Pigs, was that yours, too?

169
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:29,749
He�ll call.

170
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:31,895
Hey, look, you wanna come out with me and Alex?

171
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,568
We might go see a midnight movie if something really bad is playing.

172
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:35,194
No, thanks.

173
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:38,214
Just promise me you won�t sit here all night staring at the phone.

174
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,470
- Happy? 
- Delirious.

175
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,042
Oh, I should not have had that second piece of pie.

176
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,819
- Full? 
- No, just late.

177
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:47,701
- Bring me some Milk Duds. 
- It�s a plan!

178
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,667
Then I spent about forty minutes cleaning out my hard drive.

179
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,576
You would not believe the amount of junk that accumulates �

180
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:59,944
old files, things you�ve downloaded but never opened.

181
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:01,777
It really slows down your CPU.

182
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:03,340
Oh, yeah, I hate a slow CPU.

183
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:05,722
Then, all of a sudden, I looked down

184
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:09,130
and I saw all this hair and dust between the keys of my keyboard.

185
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:10,770
So, naturally, you cleaned your keyboard.

186
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,067
Yes, and I�ll tell you, it was a strangely satisfying experience.

187
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:15,506
One question.

188
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:18,398
During this time that you watched TV, did homework,

189
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:21,568
proofread articles for The Franklin, organized my sock drawer,

190
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:24,098
returned emails and gave a much needed cleaning to your computer,

191
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,797
did it ever occur to you to call him?

192
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:26,980
- No. 
- Why?

193
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,172
Because he said he�d call me.

194
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:31,205
Right. Okay, so then I�m guessing

195
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,813
you�re not gonna mention anything to him

196
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:35,956
about your extremely productive evening alone when you see him either.

197
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:36,807
Why should I?

198
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:38,297
No reason I can think of.

199
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:42,817
You know, I almost like it better like this.

200
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,221
It is more festive.

201
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,303
Good luck tonight!

202
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:51,414
Sure, when Dean said he�d call, he always called,

203
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:52,633
but where�s the fun in that?

204
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:55,389
- Oh, honey, don�t do that. 
- Do what?

205
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,431
Compare Dean and Jess, that�s not fair.

206
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:58,578
They�re different people.

207
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:01,190
Clearly. One calls when he says he will and one doesn�t.

208
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,514
Okay, for starters, I think you have to realize something �

209
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:05,699
you were really lucky with Dean.

210
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:08,680
He was an exceptional first boyfriend, and you got spoiled.

211
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:10,764
Most of us didn�t have first boyfriends like Dean.

212
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:13,607
Most of us had first boyfriends like Brian Hutchins.

213
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:14,665
Brian Hutchins?

214
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,128
Seventh grade, I�m sitting in the library,

215
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,104
walks up, asks me to go steady. I say yes.

216
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,914
He walks away and I don�t see him again

217
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:26,013
until the tenth grade when he tries to sell me a dimebag

218
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,482
at the Sadies Hawkins Day dance.

219
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:29,151
And he was way overcharging for it, too.

220
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,012
That�s demented.

221
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:32,155
That�s what most of us had to put up with.

222
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:34,999
Where do you think the Susan Faludi�s of the world came from?

223
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,745
So, you�re telling me this is just the way it is,

224
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:39,376
and I have to get used to Jess not calling when he says he will?

225
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:42,879
No, I�m saying you just have to realize

226
00:09:42,944 --> 00:09:44,076
that every guy is different.

227
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,529
Give Jess a chance to explain before you freeze him out.

228
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:52,188
- Jess. 
- Hey.

229
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:53,836
That table�s clean if you want it.

230
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,518
Well, I hope that cleared it up for you.

231
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,098
Not a word. Not even a lame-o apology that is obviously a lie.

232
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:02,735
Yeah, how dare he not lie to you.

233
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,807
Finally, two people who don�t give a damn about hockey.

234
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:09,377
Oh, someone�s testy.

235
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,996
Just look at these dippy people with their buttons and their pennants.

236
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:14,886
You�d think the town had never been in a semi-regional playoff before.

237
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:16,391
But hasn�t it been like forty years?

238
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,613
Yeah, for the hockey team, yeah. But back when I was on the track team,

239
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,610
we went to state three times in four years and won it twice.

240
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:24,645
Think they made buttons and put up banners? They couldn�t care less.

241
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,807
Luke, that�s because track is for dorks.

242
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,721
Yeah, it�s true. I�m sorry.

243
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:32,361
Okay, the conversing part of this morning is now over.

244
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:34,441
- What do you want? 
- Jack omelet, bacon on the side.

245
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:36,853
Three blueberry and two lemon poppy seed muffins to go.

246
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:38,737
Lane�s band is rehearsing at my house.

247
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:39,882
I wanted to bring them something.

248
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,092
- You got that, Jess? 
- Yup.

249
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:41,886
Be right back.

250
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:45,213
Five muffins to go.

251
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,970
Thank you. I�ll see you later.

252
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,201
What was that, you guys in a fight or something?

253
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,486
No, you are.

254
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:52,489
What are you talking about?

255
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:54,215
Last night, didn�t you guys have plans to do something?

256
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:55,987
I don�t know. I just said I�d call her after work.

257
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,036
And did you?

258
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:59,018
I had to work another shift, I didn�t get off until midnight.

259
00:10:59,146 --> 00:10:59,904
It was too late to call.

260
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,399
And you couldn�t have taken two seconds at work

261
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:02,935
- to call and tell her that? 
- No.

262
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,809
Really? You don�t get breaks?

263
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:07,395
Do you get food, water? Should I get Michael Moore on the phone?

264
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:09,038
Whatever. I gotta unload some boxes.

265
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:10,621
Nice talking to you.

266
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,910
See, I knew once my mom found out Dave

267
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:17,953
was part of a Christian trio, it was only a matter of time

268
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,072
before she booked him to play at one of her prayer meetings.

269
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,469
It�s perfect. Now your mom�s gonna get to know the whole band.

270
00:11:22,587 --> 00:11:25,111
Not just get to know them, but love them the way she loves Dave.

271
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:26,411
Your mom loves Dave?

272
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:28,244
She said he�s a righteous young man

273
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:30,518
who�s proven he can be trusted around antique furniture.

274
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:32,044
In her book, that�s pretty close to love.

275
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:32,822
Oh, sure.

276
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:42,709
A mighty fortress is our God,

277
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:47,856
a bulwark never failing.

278
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,303
- Dude, what�s a bulwark? 
- What?

279
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,895
It says, a bulwark never failing.

280
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:54,460
I think it�s a wall.

281
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:55,895
Then why don�t they just say that?

282
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:57,344
Bulwark sounds totally gay.

283
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,740
I don�t think you�re supposed to call a hymn gay.

284
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,932
It�s like a sin or something.

285
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,827
Whatever, man. I�m not saying bulwark.

286
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,619
So, Dave, Lane just gets to sit back

287
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:06,069
and watch you guys play tonight, huh?

288
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:08,577
- You�re like a groupie. 
- No, actually, she�s got a date.

289
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:09,331
What?

290
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,646
Oh, yeah. Remember Young Chui,

291
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,448
the guy my mom introduced me to at the wedding?

292
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,614
She arranged for him to take me to the hockey game tonight.

293
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:17,302
- It�s the first of three dates. 
- The first of three?

294
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,316
Then he�s gonna dump her.

295
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:19,698
Young Chui, the guy you haven�t gone out with yet?

296
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,163
Yes. And I�ll be crushed,

297
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,441
making my mom feel so guilty about setting me up with him

298
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:25,377
that she�ll have to let me go out with Dave to make up for it.

299
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,432
I came up with that twist.

300
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:27,870
Dave has a natural gift for subterfuge.

301
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:29,607
Wow, a compliment from the master.

302
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:35,602
I would�ve thought of it myself, but I let him take the credit.

303
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,072
Men sometimes need that.

304
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,790
I�m telling you dude, it doesn�t make any sense.

305
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:41,731
Fine, stop yelling at me. I didn�t write it.

306
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,302
Whoa. What�s wrong?

307
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:45,690
This stupid song, man.

308
00:12:46,406 --> 00:12:49,837
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe.

309
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:51,434
I mean, who talks like that, the Pope?

310
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:53,046
Dude, is any of those lemon poppy seed?

311
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:54,363
Can�t you update it a little?

312
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,177
Sure, man.

313
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:57,922
Just tell me what the hell it means. It�s like in Latin or something.

314
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,632
I thought there was gonna be coffee, too.

315
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,586
Dude, can you chill out about your freaking elevensees

316
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,459
�til we get this song straightened out?

317
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:07,138
I�m hypoglycemic. If I don�t get something in my system, I�m gonna crash.

318
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,284
Is abi-death a word?

319
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:10,420
But how are you gonna make Young Chui dump you?

320
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,593
Just be a really bad date?

321
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,897
Oh, no, we�ve already talked to him. He�s totally on board.

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,849
- Really? 
- Oh, yeah.

323
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:17,096
See, he�s in love with this Japanese girl named Karen

324
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,703
who his parents don�t approve of, so he and Karen see each other secretly

325
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:21,792
while his parents keep setting him up with nice Korean girls.

326
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,560
- He�s the male me. 
- Gotcha.

327
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,037
You and Jess should come with us to the game tonight. It�ll be fun.

328
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:27,870
Yeah, I�m not sure what we�re doing tonight.

329
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:32,822
A mighty fortress is our God,

330
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:37,938
a wall ten stories high.

331
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:42,852
And he helps us when things get bad

332
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:48,018
and the devil tries to hurt us.

333
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,027
What hymn is that?

334
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,277
I have no idea.

335
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:54,148
If for some reason, you should get separated from the group,

336
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:58,172
you�ll find a map on the third page of your welcome packet.

337
00:13:58,357 --> 00:13:59,939
Why�d you draw your store so big?

338
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,498
It just makes it easier to find if you get lost.

339
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,230
It�s bigger than the school.

340
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:06,313
And why�d you put all those P�s in soda shop?

341
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:07,865
Is that supposed to fancy or something?

342
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:11,746
You are in room twelve, and your father is...

343
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:12,581
Are you from France?

344
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:13,785
Excuse me?

345
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:16,046
You talk funny. You from France.

346
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:18,741
Yes. So, as I was saying...

347
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:20,759
I was in France during the Big One.

348
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:23,156
Oh, that�s nice. So...

349
00:14:23,256 --> 00:14:24,977
Nice? It was a war.

350
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,380
What�s nice about that?

351
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,207
Of course. So, your father is...

352
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:30,574
Don�t give me that attitude, Frenchy.

353
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:33,297
You�d be speaking German now if it wasn�t for me.

354
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:39,617
Just make sure to have the vans back at 3:45 to take �em to the game.

355
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,658
Oh, Lorelai, just a second. I wanted to...

356
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:44,768
Hold on there, what is this?

357
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,829
That�s the itinerary I�ve worked out for the afternoon.

358
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:49,623
I thought Lorelai could post it in case some of the inn�s other guests

359
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,998
wanted to join us in our pre-game activities.

360
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:54,992
Oh, Lorelai, this is my older brother Doug. Doug, this is Lorelai.

361
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,109
- Hello. 
- Nice to meet you.

362
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,126
Taylor, I told you on the phone,

363
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,553
no one is gonna wanna do any of this crap.

364
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:02,648
A tour of Stars Hollow?

365
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,132
Most of us were born here.

366
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,454
What do we need a tour for?

367
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:06,841
Everyone, listen up.

368
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,627
We�re meeting down here in two hours for the vans to the game.

369
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,136
You�re late, you�re walking.

370
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,560
Go back to your store and count peaches or something.

371
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:16,954
I�m taking a nap.

372
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:22,100
Lorelai, hello.

373
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:23,796
Mom?

374
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,285
You remember, I�m so touched.

375
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:26,333
What are you doing here?

376
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:31,495
Well, I was thinking about possibly having our next DAR luncheon here.

377
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,909
- Really? 
- That�s right.

378
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:34,604
So I thought I would stop by

379
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,973
and make sure the place is as charming as I remember.

380
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,062
It is.

381
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:41,545
Okay, well, what day would you like to have the meeting?

382
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:42,837
The fifteenth.

383
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,095
The fifteenth.

384
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,771
Well, the fifteenth looks wide open,

385
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,814
so you�re officially down for the fifteenth.

386
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:52,289
- Wonderful. 
- Okay.

387
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:53,675
Okay.

388
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,073
So.

389
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,678
So, how is Michel?

390
00:15:58,793 --> 00:15:59,543
Michel�s fine.

391
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:01,618
Well, good. I�m glad to hear it.

392
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:03,180
Well, I�m glad to tell it.

393
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,815
But Mom, I have this really big family reunion party

394
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,310
that invaded the place today, so I should probably get back to work.

395
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:11,459
Oh, yes, you go right ahead. Do not let me keep you.

396
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:16,559
Mom?

397
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,705
I�m not allowed to go home.

398
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:19,950
What?

399
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:21,751
She�s banished me from my own house

400
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,548
- Gran? 
- She�s gone mad.

401
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:26,114
This morning she announces that she�s hosting a meeting

402
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:28,238
of her bitter old biddies club at our house tonight

403
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,888
and she needs the entire day to prepare because the house is in such a shambles.

404
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:32,980
Nice, subtle.

405
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,699
Then I was handed a list of chores and asked not to come home

406
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:38,055
until at least six o�clock because I would simply be in the way.

407
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:40,584
Mom, she�s only staying with you for a few days.

408
00:16:40,722 --> 00:16:43,016
I have to buy her flowers. She doesn�t like mine, they�re too tall.

409
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,239
It�s ostentatious to have flowers that tall.

410
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:47,246
Actually, I�ve been meaning to mention that to you myself.

411
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:48,408
I have to get new guest towels.

412
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:51,966
I have to get new highball glasses. I have to get four very specific types of cheese.

413
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:53,752
And I have to get a slide projector

414
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,288
because they�re going to view slides of potential acquisitions

415
00:16:56,421 --> 00:16:57,983
for the museum that they�re on the board of.

416
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,730
Okay, Mom...

417
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:01,270
Of course, I haven�t the faintest idea of where to find a slide projector.

418
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:03,067
- I feel like I�m going insane. 
- Mom.

419
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,188
I�m sorry.

420
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:06,487
I think I�m just a little sensitive right now.

421
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:11,199
It�s selfish, I know, but Richard�s traveling more than he ever did.

422
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,600
He�s been gone three of the last four weeks,

423
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:16,728
and now he�s finally home, and she�s there commanding all of his attention,

424
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:17,890
all of his time.

425
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:20,994
I sound like a spoiled high school girl.

426
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:23,585
Not quite. You still haven�t asked for the Gloria Vanderbilt jeans

427
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:25,474
- and the convertible Rabbit. 
- Oh, never mind.

428
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,759
I�m sorry I kept you from your work.

429
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:28,577
Mom, listen, I have a slide projector.

430
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:29,918
I�d be happy to bring it over tonight.

431
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:31,967
Oh, I really appreciate this, Lorelai.

432
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,035
I mean it, I couldn�t be more grateful.

433
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,930
- Hold on. 
- Where are you going?

434
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,965
I wanna get a tape recorder. I want that last thing on tape.

435
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,049
- Lorelai. 
- Just remember what you said.

436
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,764
You have everything you need � water, extension cords?

437
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,335
Yes, ma�am, I think we�re good.

438
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:50,575
Where�s your tambourine?

439
00:17:51,382 --> 00:17:52,171
We don�t have one.

440
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:53,529
Next time bring one.

441
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:58,412
Dude, remember the drill instructor in Full Metal Jacket?

442
00:17:58,638 --> 00:17:59,309
Totally.

443
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:03,230
- Good evening. 
- Ah, Young Chui, come in.

444
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:07,374
Lane, look, Young Chui is here.

445
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:10,912
These are for you.

446
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:13,650
Thank you, they�re beautiful. Isn�t that nice of him, Mama?

447
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:15,683
Yes, very thoughtful. Stand together now.

448
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:17,517
Don�t smile.

449
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,117
Very nice. That one�s for the grandchildren.

450
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:24,383
We better go. We don�t wanna be late for the game.

451
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,321
I will put these in a vase for you for your bedside table.

452
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:28,664
Now, go have fun.

453
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,713
We�ll be home by nine.

454
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:31,828
Ah, yes, whatever. Go, go.

455
00:18:38,387 --> 00:18:40,090
Oh, thank goodness you haven�t left.

456
00:18:40,257 --> 00:18:40,885
Why, what�s up?

457
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:43,210
Emily called and asked if you can bring some serving dishes.

458
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,736
Apparently, hers are tacky.

459
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:47,614
My, Gran is a relentless old broad, isn�t she?

460
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:48,654
You want them where?

461
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:50,562
Just on the counter�s fine. Thanks, hon.

462
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:52,745
Hello?

463
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:54,870
- Rory. 
- Mom?

464
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,062
What are you doing there?

465
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,095
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

466
00:18:58,228 --> 00:18:59,319
I live here, remember?

467
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:00,599
Who were you expecting to find?

468
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,620
No one. I was calling to check messages and see if Mom called.

469
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:04,788
She hasn�t.

470
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,070
No one has. In fact, this is the first time the phone�s rung all day.

471
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:09,944
What, ah?

472
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:11,316
Okay, get out.

473
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,172
Excuse me?

474
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:13,471
Out of the house, get out of the house.

475
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:14,737
- Why? 
- Why?

476
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:16,114
Look at the clock, what does it say?

477
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:18,397
It says six.

478
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:20,662
So, it is six on a Saturday night,

479
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:23,605
which means you have now spent a day and a night waiting for him to call.

480
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:24,465
I know.

481
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:25,684
That�s not good, kid.

482
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:27,327
Look, let�s say he does call.

483
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:30,410
You can�t be the kind of girl that gets all mad in her head

484
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:33,390
and then forgets everything once he deigns to show up, right?

485
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:36,943
Okay, so don�t just sit there waiting.

486
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:38,167
Go out, do something.

487
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,355
Like what?

488
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,127
I don�t know. What�s Lane doing tonight?

489
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:43,277
She�s going to the hockey game with her fake boyfriend.

490
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:44,205
Perfect.

491
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,119
Perfect? It�s a hockey game.

492
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:47,215
It�ll be fun.

493
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:48,847
There�ll be cheerleaders and clowns,

494
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,257
people doing the wave.

495
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,238
You have no idea what a hockey game is, do you?

496
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:53,210
It doesn�t matter.

497
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:55,933
Put on a jacket and get outta there, and if he calls...

498
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:57,706
- Who cares! 
- That�s my girl.

499
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:58,627
Thanks, Mom.

500
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:39,545
Oh my.

501
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:45,294
And the rockets red glare,

502
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:49,002
the bombs bursting in air,

503
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,611
gave proof through the night

504
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:56,596
that our flag was still there.

505
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:05,222
Oh say, does that star spangled banner yet wave,

506
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:10,829
o�er the land of the free

507
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:20,603
and the home of the brave.

508
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:26,113
- Hey. 
- Rory.

509
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:28,310
- It�s cold in here. 
- It�s the ice.

510
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:30,993
Oh my God, there really is ice. Cool.

511
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:32,600
- What are you doing here? 
- I�m hockeying.

512
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,506
- That�s not a word. 
- Where is everybody?

513
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:36,533
There was a monster truck show in Woodbury tonight,

514
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,314
pulls a lot of the same demographic. Sit.

515
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:41,669
Where�s Jess?

516
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:42,919
Don�t know, don�t care.

517
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,920
- Really? 
- I�m a free woman tonight.

518
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,101
- Is everything okay? 
- Everything�s fine.

519
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:48,602
- You sure? 
- Absolutely.

520
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:51,438
I just wanted to see some good hockey playing.

521
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:53,276
Really.

522
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:55,033
Is that Young Chui?

523
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:56,426
You mean the guy with the cell phone

524
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:57,766
stapled to his ear � yeah, that�s him.

525
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,537
- He looks kind of serious. 
- He�s talking to Karen.

526
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:01,469
His real girlfriend?

527
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,037
I think she�s not quite as cool as Dave is

528
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:05,150
about the whole fake dating thing. She needs reassurance.

529
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:06,405
Dave is pretty cool.

530
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,551
The coolest, isn�t it? I mean, besides Jess.

531
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:09,753
Right.

532
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:11,309
Right.

533
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,383
People of Stars Hollow,

534
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:20,962
are you ready to rumble?

535
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:24,587
Then let�s get it on.

536
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:35,264
And the puck is down as the first quarter begins.

537
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:37,870
Period, sorry.

538
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:39,334
First period begins, my bad.

539
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,360
So, this is sports.

540
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:48,023
I once was lost,

541
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:51,466
but now am found,

542
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:57,087
was blind, but now I see.

543
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:04,392
Amen.

544
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:07,157
Very nice.

545
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:09,897
You may now take a fifteen-minute break while we finish our tea.

546
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,778
Also, good time to retune.

547
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:15,516
Was she looking at me?

548
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:16,789
She wasn�t looking at me, dude.

549
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,877
Hey, I�m gonna go outside and get some air, okay?

550
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:21,249
Sure.

551
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,525
Okay, be right back.

552
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:46,646
Believe me, I am not interested in Young Chui in that way.

553
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:48,583
He�s cute and all, but I�ve got a guy.

554
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:51,767
No, no, when I say he�s cute,

555
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:54,188
I just mean he�s your boyfriend and you�ve got good taste, that�s all.

556
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:56,462
Hey, Koreans do not have problems!

557
00:23:56,984 --> 00:23:58,203
You talk to her, I�m done.

558
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,135
Karen?

559
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:00,414
That went well.

560
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:04,066
Hey Lindsay, how are you?

561
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:04,900
Hi Lindsay.

562
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:06,350
Hi. I�m good, thanks.

563
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:07,993
- How are you? 
- Good.

564
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,077
You know, just enjoying my first hockey game.

565
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:12,294
It seems there�s a lot of bashing of people into walls,

566
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:13,522
which is always good fun in my book.

567
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:15,632
Oh, absolutely. I�m all for more bashing.

568
00:24:16,016 --> 00:24:17,840
You know, I don�t think we�ve seen each other

569
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,667
since I left Stars Hollow High. What have you been up to?

570
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:20,911
Oh, you know, nothing really.

571
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:22,652
The usual, school.

572
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:24,716
Right, sure.

573
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:28,644
School. Me too, but you know that since we go to school together.

574
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,303
I should be getting back.

575
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,757
It was good seeing you again.

576
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:32,704
You, too.

577
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:34,178
Bye.

578
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:36,928
Okay, so that was weird, right?

579
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:37,925
Oh, yeah, really weird.

580
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:39,247
But I didn�t do anything, did I?

581
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,696
You mean like ask her how she was?

582
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:42,212
Yeah, you probably made an enemy for life.

583
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:44,665
Maybe she�s angry because I didn�t keep in touch

584
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:46,432
after I left, but we weren�t that good of friends.

585
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,162
Maybe, or it could be that Chilton thing.

586
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:49,222
What Chilton thing?

587
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:51,337
You know how some people think because you went to Chilton,

588
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,134
you�re a snob and think you�re better than everyone else.

589
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:54,864
What? Who thinks that?

590
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:58,889
You know, like Julie Lersten, Kristin Keiffer, Jill Allen.

591
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:00,415
- Haven�t we talked about this? 
- No.

592
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,325
- Dave. 
- Hey Rory.

593
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:04,349
So, where�s Young Chui?

594
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:05,358
Talking to Karen.

595
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:06,647
- Who? 
- His girlfriend.

596
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:09,458
Oh, right. That�s cool, okay.

597
00:25:10,032 --> 00:25:12,024
- Well, how�s the game? 
- The other team�s winning.

598
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,720
But our fans have the best insults. At least, Babette does.

599
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:15,986
That�s really what counts in the end.

600
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:17,912
So, what are you doing here? Did you finish already?

601
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:19,949
Oh, no. You�re mom gave us a fifteen minute break.

602
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:20,922
I just thought I�d swing by.

603
00:25:21,031 --> 00:25:22,121
But it�s more than a mile away.

604
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:24,277
Yeah, I better get back. I�ll see you later.

605
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:25,157
Bye.

606
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:26,882
Well, well, well.

607
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:28,557
If I didn�t know better, I�d say someone

608
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,185
isn�t quite as cool as we thought he was.

609
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:31,108
What do you mean?

610
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:32,761
He�s jealous.

611
00:25:33,211 --> 00:25:35,776
Oh my God, he�s jealous, that�s so great.

612
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:38,449
You�ve worked your womanly wiles on him, Lane Kim.

613
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,867
I�ve never made a guy jealous before. I feel so powerful.

614
00:25:40,984 --> 00:25:43,442
Just remember, there�s cute jealous and there�s Othello.

615
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:44,414
Good point.

616
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:46,755
So, who else thinks I�m a snob?

617
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:00,743
- Jess. 
- Hey, is Rory here?

618
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,530
- Are you serious? 
-  Yeah, I�m serious.

619
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:04,219
No, I�m serious. Are you serious?

620
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:05,592
Why do you keep asking me if I�m serious?

621
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:07,640
Because I�m just trying to imagine the scenario here.

622
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:10,093
You looked at the clock that said it was 7:30 on a Saturday night

623
00:26:10,164 --> 00:26:12,792
and you thought to yourself, "Hey, Rory must be home."

624
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:13,529
Yes.

625
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:14,904
I�m sorry, are you serious?

626
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,887
Okay, I�m guessing that�s your way of telling me she�s not home.

627
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,034
No, Jess, she�s not home.

628
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:18,849
Do you know where she is?

629
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:19,806
She�s at the hockey game.

630
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:22,177
Hey, look, you don�t wanna tell me where she is, fine.

631
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,512
Jess, she really is at the hockey game.

632
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:26,806
You�d know that if you�d � what, ladies and gentlemen?

633
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:27,875
That�s right � bothered to call.

634
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:29,032
Why are you hassling me?

635
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,700
Well, mostly because I�m here to hassle you.

636
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:32,914
Now, if you�d bothered calling,

637
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:34,408
maybe Rory would be here to hassle you.

638
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:37,246
Hey, Rory knows I�m not the kind of guy who lives by a schedule.

639
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:39,253
Yes, and look what the guy who doesn�t live

640
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:42,602
by a schedule ends up doing on a Saturday night � talking to his girlfriend�s mother.

641
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:43,564
Whatever.

642
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:44,624
Hey, Jess.

643
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:46,473
You like music, right?

644
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:48,223
The Beach Boys said it best.

645
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:50,134
None of the guys go steady �cause it wouldn�t be right

646
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:52,023
to leave their best girls home on a Saturday night.

647
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:56,088
Rory is one of the best girls. She�s the best girl, if you want my opinion,

648
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:59,294
and you don�t seem to have the first idea as to how she should be treated.

649
00:26:59,448 --> 00:27:00,871
Luckily I�ve got you to tell me.

650
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:01,778
Not anymore.

651
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:04,004
You and I have discussed your relationship with Rory long enough.

652
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:04,916
Fine.

653
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,098
I�ll tell her you stopped by.

654
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,195
Don�t bother.

655
00:27:08,224 --> 00:27:10,380
Brian Hutchins is looking pretty good right about now.

656
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:14,158
If I had known sports were so much about eating,

657
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,602
I would�ve come to a lot more of these.

658
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:17,056
I know. There�s something deeply satisfying

659
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:19,089
about watching other people exercise while eating junk food.

660
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,229
Ten minutes �til the next period, ladies and gentlemen.

661
00:27:21,326 --> 00:27:23,918
That�s what we call them in hockey � periods, not halves.

662
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:25,248
Let�s try to keep that straight.

663
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:28,393
Also, the puck is never referred to as a ball,

664
00:27:28,495 --> 00:27:30,180
not according to the book. Again, my bad.

665
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,358
I guess it wasn�t the Chilton thing after all.

666
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,619
Number twelve has it now.

667
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,432
He�s skating, he�s skating.

668
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,094
My bet is he�s going to try to whack it into that net thingy,

669
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,532
but that�s conjecture at this point.

670
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,161
Now it�s going the other way and they�re hitting it between them.

671
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,549
Number seven has it.

672
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:55,567
Now number three. Now seven.

673
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:58,024
Three again. Seven. Ten�s got it now.

674
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,186
Kirk, just to let you know, some of the guys

675
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,313
- not me, you know � but some of the guys say they�re gonna rip your head off

676
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:03,611
if you don�t shut up, okay?

677
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,357
We�ll be pausing for a short break.

678
00:28:08,532 --> 00:28:10,589
We�ve got spirit, yes we do!

679
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:13,089
We�ve got spirit, how about you?

680
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,240
You sure you�re okay?

681
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:17,426
Will you stop asking me that every five seconds? I�m fine.

682
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:20,748
I mean, it had to happen sometime.

683
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:23,109
I didn�t expect him to just sit around pining for me.

684
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,227
Okay, a little, but...

685
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:28,730
she�s really nice, right?

686
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:30,759
- This is all my fault. 
- Lane.

687
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:34,149
I let you down. I�m supposed to be your eyes and ears in that school,

688
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:36,566
and here�s the biggest piece of news all year and I had no idea.

689
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:38,317
- It�s okay. 
- No, it�s not.

690
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:40,882
This is an intelligence gaffe of monumental proportions.

691
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:42,853
What was I doing that I didn�t notice this?

692
00:28:43,046 --> 00:28:44,323
Studying, taking classes.

693
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,209
Well, no more.

694
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:47,728
Lane, it�s not a big deal, really.

695
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:50,140
And now I know, so, case closed.

696
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:51,137
You�re sure?

697
00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:53,288
Positive. Let�s just enjoy the game.

698
00:28:56,913 --> 00:28:58,664
- No way! 
- Excuse me, will you tell me what happened?

699
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:00,022
Excuse me, number fourteen?

700
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:01,896
Number fourteen, could you come back here?

701
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:11,086
Hi. Just came to drop off some things.

702
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,833
- Oh, I can take those. 
- Oh, great, thanks.

703
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:13,759
Careful, it�s heavy.

704
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,355
Everyone�s in the living room if you wanna go in.

705
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:18,716
If I wanna go in, if I wanna go in.

706
00:29:18,818 --> 00:29:21,179
You pose a very deep and philosophical question there,

707
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:22,879
- but I think I�ll just... 
- Lorelai.

708
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,961
I thought I heard your voice.

709
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,035
Yes, I brought the slide machine

710
00:29:28,153 --> 00:29:30,110
and the platters and the punch bowl.

711
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:32,310
Wonderful. Come in and meet everyone, won�t you?

712
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,529
I was just gonna do that.

713
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:36,238
- It�s obscene. 
- It�s Picasso.

714
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,166
- Then Picasso is obscene. 
- Oh, Isabelle.

715
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:40,631
It has six breasts.

716
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:42,854
You cannot be sure if those are breasts.

717
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:44,405
They could be canons.

718
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,431
He was quite obsessed with the Spanish Civil War for awhile.

719
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:48,814
Ladies, look who�s here.

720
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:50,303
Lorelai, wonderful.

721
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:52,638
We all need a break for a moment.

722
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:54,200
Come meet my friends.

723
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:58,229
Emily, we were waiting for iced tea or am I imagining things?

724
00:29:58,383 --> 00:29:59,560
It�s on its way, Mom.

725
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:01,214
So is death.

726
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:05,409
Lorelai, this is Mrs. Van Wyck,

727
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:07,482
Mrs. Deerborne, Mrs. Rutherman.

728
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,903
This is my granddaughter, Lorelai.

729
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:10,944
Nice to meet you all.

730
00:30:11,235 --> 00:30:12,142
Well, come, sit.

731
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:13,878
Oh, I don�t want to interrupt anything.

732
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,996
You�re interrupting nothing but thirst, my dear.

733
00:30:17,211 --> 00:30:19,530
Now, talk to some old women,

734
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,717
tell us what it�s like to be young.

735
00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:23,411
Not nearly as much fun

736
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:25,797
since the mandatory sunscreen rule, I�ll tell ya.

737
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:28,942
Here we go, iced tea and sandwiches.

738
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,798
Too warm.

739
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:36,878
Do you know that Lorelai�s daughter is graduating from Chilton in June?

740
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,313
Love in the afternoon...

741
00:30:40,415 --> 00:30:42,715
She is an excellent student and may...

742
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:45,709
Emily, what are you doing?

743
00:30:45,837 --> 00:30:48,388
- I�m sorry? 
- Why are you singing like that?

744
00:30:48,506 --> 00:30:50,784
Was I signing? I didn�t realize.

745
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:53,268
Here�s your tea, Mom.

746
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:55,254
I certainly hope it�s cold enough.

747
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:57,354
I brought the slide projector over.

748
00:30:57,446 --> 00:30:59,571
- Would you like me to set it up? 
- That would be fine.

749
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,894
We can start watching now since I do not anticipate dinner

750
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:06,141
being served anywhere near the time I requested.

751
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:11,398
Our hearts are filled with joy...

752
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:12,884
Emily you�re doing it again.

753
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:15,628
- I was? 
- Yes, you were.

754
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:21,844
You know, it�s because I caught some of "Love in the Afternoon" the other day,

755
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:23,160
the movie.

756
00:31:23,503 --> 00:31:24,666
Have you seen it, Mom?

757
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:26,370
I don�t believe I have.

758
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:28,404
Oh, well, it�s wonderful.

759
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:31,014
And a wonderful concept, too, don�t you think?

760
00:31:31,245 --> 00:31:33,831
Anyway, I must have the music stuck in my head.

761
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:35,480
That must be why I�m singing it.

762
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:38,383
I mean, what else could it be, hm?

763
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:41,107
Hey, Mom, how �bout we go get some of that cheese

764
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,561
you bought for the ladies, huh?

765
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,587
I�ll help you. Come on. We�ll be right back.

766
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:46,964
Okay, what is going on?

767
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:49,484
- I saw her kissing a man. 
- What?

768
00:31:49,622 --> 00:31:50,973
When I came home today, I walked in

769
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,216
and I saw her standing in the living room kissing a man.

770
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:55,122
- Gran? 
- Yes.

771
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,167
- My Gran? 
- Yes.

772
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:58,372
My Gran was kissing a man?

773
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,063
In a purple velour jogging suit.

774
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:01,803
Gran was in a purple velour jogging suit?

775
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:03,876
No, the man was wearing a purple jogging suit.

776
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:05,183
And you�re sure they were kissing?

777
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:06,668
One hundred percent sure.

778
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:07,651
My God.

779
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,370
- Was he hot? 
- Excuse me?

780
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:11,798
Well, I don�t know what you�re supposed to ask

781
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:14,301
when you hear your grandmother�s been making out with a guy.

782
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,504
I don�t know if he was hot.

783
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:17,533
Your grandmother sucking face was blocking my view.

784
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:19,007
What�d she do? Did she see you?

785
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,887
No. After my heart started back up again,

786
00:32:20,964 --> 00:32:23,058
I went outside and hid in the bushes until he left.

787
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,766
Okay, now I have two really good visuals fighting for top billing here.

788
00:32:25,864 --> 00:32:28,025
Do you realize how wonderful this is?

789
00:32:28,189 --> 00:32:30,308
Yeah, I guess it�s wonderful, Gran has a guy.

790
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:33,682
No, what�s wonderful is after all these years of her abuse,

791
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:36,099
her condescension, her insults and her degrading comments,

792
00:32:36,243 --> 00:32:38,946
after all these years of pure unadulterated hell,

793
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:40,867
I finally have something to hold over her.

794
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:41,808
Oh, Mom.

795
00:32:41,953 --> 00:32:43,190
Finally, I have the upper hand.

796
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,431
Finally, I have something to nail her with. Finally, that woman is going down.

797
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:48,137
You cannot use this against Gran.

798
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:49,623
Yes, I can, I�ve earned it.

799
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:52,157
Mom, I know Gran gives you a hard time,

800
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,070
but she did not tell anyone about this guy for a reason.

801
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:56,868
Yes, because she�s embarrassed. She should be.

802
00:32:56,964 --> 00:32:57,800
He was dressed like a bookie.

803
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,381
You have to be above this.

804
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,709
No, I don�t have to be above this.

805
00:33:00,836 --> 00:33:02,685
You�re seriously telling me that you�re gonna be the one

806
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:06,017
to go out there and humiliate Gran in front of her friends,

807
00:33:06,222 --> 00:33:09,346
in front of her family. Just think about it, Mom.

808
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:10,851
What would Miss Manners do?

809
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:13,412
It�s not fair.

810
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,629
Gran will be back in her own house soon.

811
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:17,010
I know, you�re right.

812
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:18,731
Just hang on �til then.

813
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:21,414
All right, let�s go back in there and get this evening over with.

814
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:25,269
You�re a stand up lady, Emily Gilmore, you know that?

815
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:27,744
Oh really? Well, that makes me feel so much better.

816
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,637
And is this normal, Richard, to be getting home from work so late?

817
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:35,670
Oh, that�s one of the pitfalls of starting your own business, I�m afraid.

818
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,854
You should say, of starting a successful business, Richard.

819
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:41,465
Successful so far, Trix. Let�s not jinx it.

820
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,224
Though, perhaps if Emily could have the meal served on time,

821
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:49,136
Richard would have more inducement to get home at a reasonable hour.

822
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:51,317
I saw her kissing a man in a track suit!

823
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:52,925
- What? 
- Emily!

824
00:33:56,941 --> 00:33:59,320
Ladies and gentlemen, much like the Israelites of Yore,

825
00:33:59,418 --> 00:34:02,116
the Stars Hollow Minutemen languished in the desert for forty years.

826
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,520
But tonight, there was no Promised Land, no New Canaan,

827
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:08,071
only a humiliating five to one defeat

828
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:10,072
at the merciless hands of the West Hartford Wildcats.

829
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:13,708
So it�s back to the desert for the Minutemen, perhaps for another forty years.

830
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:16,243
Of course, by then, I�ll be seventy years old.

831
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,608
A lot of the rest of you will probably be dead.

832
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:20,110
Taylor, you�ll be dead.

833
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,162
Babette, Miss Patty...

834
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:24,481
that man there in the hat.

835
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,390
Hey, if we run, we might be able to catch the last few minutes of the band.

836
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:29,581
Yeah, I don�t think the pint of liquid cheese

837
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:31,430
in my stomach is going to allow for much running.

838
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:33,243
- I�ll call you tomorrow. 
- Definitely. Have fun.

839
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:34,348
- Bye. 
- Bye.

840
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:41,855
Dean. Hey, how are you?

841
00:34:42,004 --> 00:34:43,989
Oh, God, that�s a stupid question to ask someone

842
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,198
who just lost the regional semi-finals, isn�t it?

843
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:49,173
And now it sounds like I�m rubbing your face in it.

844
00:34:49,258 --> 00:34:51,840
Don�t worry about it. They were better than us, they deserved to win.

845
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:54,590
And hey, at least you got a point. That�s good, right?

846
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,079
I mean, better than not getting any.

847
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:58,996
Geez, I really suck at this post-sports talk.

848
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:00,937
Well, you haven�t had much practice.

849
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:03,559
True. But who knows, I might be a sports convert.

850
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:06,001
I mean, the eating of massive amounts of junk food,

851
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:09,105
and listening to Kirk make a fool of himself in front of a bunch of people �

852
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:10,078
all things I enjoy.

853
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:12,378
In fact, you could almost get rid of the sports part of it.

854
00:35:12,474 --> 00:35:13,482
That�s what I was going to say.

855
00:35:15,695 --> 00:35:17,107
So, I ran into Lindsay.

856
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:19,796
Yeah, I hadn�t quite figured out how to tell you that.

857
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,394
- Well, I think it�s great. 
- You do?

858
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:24,989
Absolutely. I mean, she�s cute and smart and really nice.

859
00:35:25,183 --> 00:35:25,935
I know.

860
00:35:26,213 --> 00:35:27,764
Like once, in fourth grade,

861
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:29,705
we went on a field trip to Mark Twain�s house,

862
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:32,962
and I really wanted this refrigerator magnet in the shape of Mark Twain�s head,

863
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,040
but I didn�t have any money, so she bought it for me,

864
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:36,448
and she wouldn�t even let me pay her back.

865
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,649
Pretty classy for a fourth grader.

866
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:39,843
That sounds like Lindsay.

867
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:40,822
Exactly.

868
00:35:41,436 --> 00:35:44,129
So, good job, mister.

869
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,016
Thanks. So, how are things with Jess?

870
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,490
Oh, good, good.

871
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:50,805
He�s not with you?

872
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:53,770
No. This really isn�t his kind of thing.

873
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:56,110
Yeah. Well, I�d better go.

874
00:35:56,192 --> 00:35:58,096
I gotta change and then Lindsay and I are going out.

875
00:35:58,265 --> 00:35:59,936
Right. Sure.

876
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:01,020
Have fun.

877
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,664
You�ve reached Luke Danes and Jess Mariano, leave a message.

878
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:18,061
It�s me. I just wanted to let you know

879
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:22,649
that this is the last weekend I spend sitting around like an idiot hoping you�ll call, okay?

880
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:25,317
I�m not going to be that girl. From now on, I want a plan.

881
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:27,703
I mean, a real plan with a time and a place,

882
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:30,565
and I�m tired of hearing �Let�s hook up later.�

883
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:32,807
What does that mean anyway? What�s later?

884
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:34,574
How do I set my watch to later?

885
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:36,601
Later doesn�t cut it anymore, got it?

886
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,131
And, yeah, you know, maybe I am spoiled.

887
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,409
But guess what? I like being spoiled. I plan to go on being spoiled.

888
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:46,494
And if that doesn't sound like something that you can or want to do, then fine.

889
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:48,398
I'm sure you'll find another girl who doesn't mind sitting around

890
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:50,652
cleaning her keyboard on a Friday night hoping you�ll call,

891
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:51,835
but it�s not going to be me.

892
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:54,554
Oh, yeah, this is a message for Jess.

893
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:04,979
Hey. Figured I�d find you here.

894
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:08,584
I mean, you say the word hockey, you say the word Rory, right?

895
00:37:08,824 --> 00:37:09,981
What are you doing here?

896
00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:12,490
- Came to give you these. 
- Earplugs.

897
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:15,818
- What are these for? 
- I got tickets to the Distillers.

898
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:17,083
You did? For when?

899
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,112
For tonight.

900
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:19,566
Tonight? But...

901
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:21,415
I would�ve been here sooner, but I had to wait in line.

902
00:37:22,893 --> 00:37:24,835
So we should probably get going.

903
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:27,098
I mean, we don�t wanna miss anything, right?

904
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,326
Hey, Jess?

905
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:37,549
When you get home,

906
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,994
could you erase your answering machine without listening to any of the messages?

907
00:37:41,246 --> 00:37:42,433
That�d be great, thanks.

908
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:45,813
Come in.

909
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:52,198
I brought you some aspirin.

910
00:37:53,622 --> 00:37:55,046
It�s the buffered kind that you like.

911
00:37:57,877 --> 00:37:59,310
Is there anything else that you need?

912
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:01,568
No, thank you.

913
00:38:08,471 --> 00:38:11,875
Mom, I want to apologize for what I said downstairs.

914
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:14,498
I had no right to humiliate you like that,

915
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:16,904
in front of your friends, in front of Richard.

916
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:19,822
This relationship was something you had chosen to keep private

917
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,532
and I should have respected that.

918
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:23,765
I am truly sorry.

919
00:38:25,986 --> 00:38:27,477
He seemed like a very nice man.

920
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,234
Why didn�t you tell anyone about him?

921
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:39,218
I married once,

922
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:41,041
I married Richard�s father.

923
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,222
That was my husband.

924
00:38:44,393 --> 00:38:45,961
I have no desire to marry again

925
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:48,296
and dishonor his memory.

926
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,966
I understand.

927
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:51,915
I believe a woman marries for life.

928
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,161
If, after your husband is gone,

929
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:59,802
you desperately desire some sort of permanent attachment,

930
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:02,465
add an addition onto the house �

931
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:04,574
a library or a solarium.

932
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,080
I have a library and a solarium.

933
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:10,109
Yes, you do.

934
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:12,936
However, in spite of all this,

935
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:15,572
I found myself getting lonely.

936
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:18,695
And I don�t care for being lonely, it�s quite annoying.

937
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:21,690
So many years ago,

938
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:24,246
I met a man,

939
00:39:24,584 --> 00:39:26,284
and he became my companion.

940
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:31,547
Tonight, both he and I were both publicly humiliated

941
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:35,143
and our relationship altered forever.

942
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:37,907
Can you imagine how that feels?

943
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,176
Actually, I�ve had a little experience

944
00:39:40,283 --> 00:39:43,218
with being humiliated in front of the people I love, yes.

945
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:46,920
Mom, please believe me,

946
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,141
I know how important your pride is to you,

947
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:51,768
and I never had any intention of robbing you of it.

948
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:54,661
I feel terrible that I caused you any pain.

949
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:58,728
I just wish that once in awhile,

950
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:01,501
you might feel a little bit terrible that you cause me pain.

951
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,325
I have pride, too, you know.

952
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:06,977
And my husband travels and is very busy

953
00:40:07,098 --> 00:40:09,264
and I miss him and I�m lonely sometimes,

954
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:11,373
just like you.

955
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:14,012
Well.

956
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:20,207
So that was quite a gathering.

957
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:22,065
Yes, it was.

958
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:26,397
It would make a great Christmas story.

959
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:28,472
I mean, I know it didn�t happen at Christmas,

960
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:30,943
but it�s the kind of thing that would happen at Christmas,

961
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:34,308
so it�s not like if you told someone it did happen at Christmas, they�d go,

962
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:36,438
�Really? �Cause it doesn�t sound like a Christmas story.�

963
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:39,346
Thanksgiving would probably work also.

964
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:44,794
Listen, Dad, I know you�re a little upset with Mom right now,

965
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:47,191
and I�m probably out of line in saying this,

966
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:49,734
but you might wanna think about cutting her some slack.

967
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,249
She�s really missed you lately.

968
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:55,839
You work so much and then you�re helping Gran in your free time,

969
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:58,722
which is totally understandable, but still, it�s hard.

970
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:03,417
As much as Gran likes you, she tends to be a littler rough on Mom,

971
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,316
and I think Mom just kind of snapped.

972
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:08,194
She�d never do anything like that intentionally.

973
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:10,022
You do know that, Dad, right?

974
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:12,813
Dad?

975
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:20,114
Okay, apparently it�s two-for-one flip out night at the Gilmore house.

976
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:22,617
Do you really think he was wearing a track suit?

977
00:41:22,786 --> 00:41:23,493
I don�t...

978
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:26,346
Well, I wonder if he was wearing Nike�s also.

979
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:30,237
Just Do It takes on a whole new meaning, doesn�t it?

980
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,169
I guess I�ve got a new daddy.

981
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,828
Maybe he�ll take you to ball games.

982
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:38,634
Oh, we could get matching jogging suits.

983
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:43,556
Oh, if only I could�ve seen Emily hiding in the bushes.

984
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:45,388
It�s like a play by Moliere.

985
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:49,623
What are you two cackling about?

986
00:41:49,868 --> 00:41:51,193
- Oh, nothing. 
- Yeah, nothing.

987
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:53,586
Well, don�t stop on my account. I�m just passing through.

988
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:54,631
Where are you going?

989
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:56,269
We�re going to have tea.

990
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:00,411
- They�re going to have tea? 
- That�s a first.

991
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,137
Maybe they�re going to be pals now.

992
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:05,562
I don�t know how I feel about my mother and my wife being in cahoots.

993
00:42:05,911 --> 00:42:08,384
I don�t know how I feel about you saying the word cahoots.

994
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:11,298
This alliance could make things very uncomfortable for me.

995
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:13,508
Sending a maid down to tell me how to make tea,

996
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,670
as if I don�t know after all these years.

997
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:19,353
Guess she�ll have a coronary if the water hits the cup one second before the bag.

998
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:22,372
- I think you�re safe. 
- I think so, too.

999
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,041
Hey, how was the game?

1000
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:29,690
Fun, we got clobbered.

1001
00:42:29,977 --> 00:42:34,655
Oh. If you�d won, you could�ve rioted through town trashing storefronts

1002
00:42:34,723 --> 00:42:36,730
and torching police cars like they do in L.A.

1003
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:37,565
Maybe next year.

1004
00:42:37,795 --> 00:42:39,095
What�d you do after?

1005
00:42:39,914 --> 00:42:41,537
Oh, you know, just hung out.

1006
00:42:41,696 --> 00:42:42,972
With Lane and her fake boyfriend?

1007
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:45,521
I thought you were eating at Grandma�s.

1008
00:42:45,653 --> 00:42:47,933
Oh, yes, and there�s a story behind that.

1009
00:42:48,123 --> 00:42:50,146
Can it wait �til tomorrow? I�m really exhausted.

1010
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:51,496
- It�s a good story. 
- I�m sure.

1011
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,232
I just won�t be able to fully appreciate it in my weakened state.

1012
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:56,505
And this gives you extra time to practice your voices.

1013
00:42:56,647 --> 00:43:00,437
Fine, fine. Let me just say two words � jogging suit.

1014
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:02,132
Jogging suit.

1015
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:03,222
See, you�re hooked.

1016
00:43:03,432 --> 00:43:05,342
Yeah, now I�m definitely waking up tomorrow.

1017
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,097
- Night honey. 
- Night Mom.
