1
00:00:00,227 --> 00:00:01,706
Previously on
"Gilmore girls"...

2
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:03,756
Here. This came a
couple of days ago.

3
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:05,207
It's from Sherry.

4
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:06,756
From Sherry?

5
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:09,483
Yeah, it's the first I've heard from
her since the divorce was final.

6
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:10,930
I'm here for the paper.
I'm Rory.

7
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,004
Okay, you got to let us show
you around the rest of the show.

8
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:13,807
That's cool.

9
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:16,678
Come on, we'll help you with your
article, give you the skinny on everyone.

10
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,430
I spoke with Sherry
this morning.

11
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:19,345
What's the deal with her?

12
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,097
She wants me to send G.G.
to Paris

13
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:22,767
to stay with her
for two months.

14
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:26,333
I know we're friends,
and I'm glad, but...

15
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,782
I don't want to be
just friends anymore.

16
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:30,752
I like... Logan.

17
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:32,422
Come to Paris with me.

18
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:34,021
- What?
- You were right.

19
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:36,631
I should take G.G. myself.
I should check everything out.

20
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:40,233
Okay, sweetie, what do we say to
mommy when we see her at the airport?

21
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,160
Bonjour!

22
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:42,963
"Bonjour, mama!
What's the haps?"

23
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:44,941
I don't know the french
word for "haps." Passports?

24
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:47,060
Got 'em. But sweetie,
even after we meet up with mommy,

25
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:48,861
we're gonna stay with
you all day, okay?

26
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:50,791
All day. You will not
be able to shake us. Cash?

27
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:51,560
Check.

28
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:53,322
- Confusing shorthand.
- Check -- I've got cash.

29
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:53,951
Thank you.

30
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:55,562
Will there be food
on the plane?

31
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:57,113
There will be food,

32
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,892
but airplane food is one
of life's cruel jokes,

33
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:02,620
so, just in case,
we have snacks up the wazoo.

34
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:05,450
Are you sure the departure's 3:30?
Why did I think it was later?

35
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,791
3:30-ish.

36
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:08,921
That's what it says on the ticket?
"Departure 3:30-ish"?

37
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:11,291
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Traffic this time of day's impossible.

38
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:12,651
All right, honey. Let's go.

39
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:15,851
You choose a trip to France
to start using free weights?

40
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:17,851
Those are my shoes--
of course it's heavy.

41
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:19,150
You teach them and teach them,

42
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,700
but they never learn,
do they, G.G.?

43
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:25,273
Why do I feel like the
departure was 6:15?

44
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:26,501
Let's go.

45
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:29,111
Now, G.G.,
you are gonna love Paris.

46
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:31,020
You know,
they call it "the city of love."

47
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:32,772
- Why?
- Why?

48
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,550
Well, because it's romantic,

49
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:37,353
and there's just
love everywhere.

50
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:39,893
Of course,
there's also pigeons everywhere,

51
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:42,741
but nobody would want to visit
the city of pigeons, would they?

52
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:43,901
I think we're ready.

53
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:47,232
Are you gonna tell me what time
this flight actually leaves?

54
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:48,482
Soon.

55
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:51,830
Your daddy is very vague, G.G.

56
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,590
How cool is it that
we're going to France?

57
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:55,633
You're going to have such a
good time staying in Paris.

58
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,760
I am green with envy.
Am I green?

59
00:01:57,778 --> 00:01:59,912
- It's more of a teal.
- It goes great with my eyes.

60
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,322
Driver, take us to France!
Au revoir, house!

61
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:03,792
Au revoir, house!

62
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:05,913
We're pretty low on gas.
Gonna have to stop and get some.

63
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:07,451
Honey, how do we have time
to stop for gas?

64
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:09,501
Our flight's not
for 3 1/2 hours.

65
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:13,352
We knew it, G.G., didn't we?

66
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,221
G.G. and I knew it.

67
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:14,351
So, as your newly
elected editor in chief,

68
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:16,661
it is my great honor to...

69
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:19,793
- honor... the stepping down...
- Okay.

70
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,432
- "Stepping down."
- Eloquent.

71
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:22,753
...of our former leader.

72
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:24,513
Anyone else thinking "recall"?

73
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:27,000
That's okay, Bill. Keep going.

74
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:29,140
As I was saying, in recognition

75
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:31,931
of  Rory's hard work and
devotion to the Daily News,

76
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,072
we have a few tokens
of our appreciation.

77
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:34,892
A.K.?

78
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:36,832
This is just something
to hang on your wall

79
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,032
when you become editor
of the New York Times.

80
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,103
Oh, thank you.

81
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:42,290
It's the front page of the
last edition you edited.

82
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,121
Yeah, she needed
that explained.

83
00:03:44,498 --> 00:03:48,050
Rory... this is to commemorate
all those articles of ours

84
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,183
that you
carefully, thoughtfully

85
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,771
ripped to shreds.

86
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:53,981
Thank you, Rob.
Now I think I have to go out

87
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:56,432
and buy a freakishly
large pencil sharpener.

88
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:58,260
I have a confession to make.

89
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:02,522
I only joined the Yale Daily
News as a way to meet cute guys,

90
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:05,952
but after watching you handle the
job of editor with intelligence

91
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:08,002
and... and grace...

92
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,733
I became inspired to
become a journalist.

93
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:12,092
Thank you.

94
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:16,252
Whoa, Joni,
I'm touched and a little damp.

95
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,871
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

96
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:19,510
I have a Rory story.

97
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:22,090
When I was running the paper,
I was dying to do an article

98
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:25,033
about everybody's asinine
obsession with Boho Chic,

99
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,800
but Rory had the
guts to tell me

100
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:29,302
that the idea for my
article was trite and passï¿½,

101
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:30,770
because that's who Rory is --

102
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:33,261
honest, direct,
and to the point.

103
00:04:33,278 --> 00:04:35,050
Like, when you all turned on me

104
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:37,262
and decided you didn't
want me in charge anymore,

105
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,551
and you all chewed me
up and spit me out,

106
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:42,082
Rory was the one who
broke the news to me.

107
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:43,480
Thank you, Rory,

108
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:45,211
for being the one
person with integrity

109
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:48,211
among a collection
of cowardly back servers.

110
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:54,790
These are all such
great stories.

111
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:57,161
- To Rory.
- To Rory!

112
00:04:57,178 --> 00:04:58,901
Thank you very much.

113
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,853
I didn't write a
speech or anything,

114
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:03,270
although I could recite "The
Charge of the Light Brigade,"

115
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:05,531
or the lyrics to
"Rebel Rebel"...

116
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:06,651
Let's hear it.

117
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:09,700
...neither of which I think
are appropriate, but, um...

118
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:12,942
Look, I've really
enjoyed being editor.

119
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,373
It's been great.

120
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:18,563
But it's time for
a change, right?

121
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:22,722
So sayeth the Yale
Daily News bylaws.

122
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:25,283
Um, so...

123
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:27,533
ladies and gentlemen,

124
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:30,553
I give you your new
editor in chief --

125
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:32,023
what's your name again? 

126
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:33,561
Ha ha.

127
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:35,583
Anyway, my first editorial move

128
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,620
is to take everyone
to Rich Man's Shoe.

129
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:38,710
Drinks on me.

130
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:40,822
All right,
that's what I'm talking about!

131
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:43,570
All right! All right!

132
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:45,660
Coming?

133
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:46,961
- Huh?
- For drinks?

134
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:49,102
Uh, no. I think I'm gonna pass.

135
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,173
How  come?

136
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:52,343
Um, well, new editor,
new regime --

137
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:54,583
I don't want it to seem like I'm
still trying to be your boss.

138
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:57,450
Yeah, no one likes someone hanging
around, telling us how to get drunk.

139
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:58,453
You know what I mean.

140
00:05:58,465 --> 00:05:59,532
Yeah.

141
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:01,312
- See you around.
- You too.

142
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:03,680
Well, now we're both
ousted leaders.

143
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,620
Welcome to club Nixon.

144
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,315
Twins, Zach.
We're having twins.

145
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,307
Yeah, it's heavy,
but we can handle it.

146
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,807
Twice as many mouths to feed,
twice as much to clean up after...

147
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,892
Yeah, all that --
plus, there's gonna be prejudice,

148
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:24,653
- but we can fight that.
- What?

149
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:25,882
And they have
surgeries now, babe.

150
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:27,552
- This does not have to be permanent.
- What doesn't?

151
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:30,452
As long as the babies don't have some vital
organ attached, they can be separated--

152
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:31,980
- easy-breezy.
- What are you talking about?

153
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:34,730
Until the operation,
we'll just get specially made clothes.

154
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:37,251
Unless they're attached at the head.
Then they can wear just about anything.

155
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:38,952
I mean,
we just slip it on from the feet up --

156
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:42,143
Zach, we're having twins,
not siamese twins.

157
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:49,873
Dude, that is such
a load off my mind!

158
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:52,643
So than why were you freaking
out at the doctor's office?

159
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,111
Because we're having twins!

160
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:56,340
Yeah, but they're separate.
It's, like, way easier.

161
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:58,712
Easier than what?
Triplets? Siamese triplets?

162
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:02,201
Yeah, Zach, twins is way
easier than siamese triplets.

163
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:07,370
I think we kind of have to tell
your mother you're pregnant now.

164
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,972
Ugh... she is so
going to kill me!

165
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:12,610
- I mean, you're starting to show.
- Of course I'm starting to show!

166
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:14,603
My body's filling up
with two growing people!

167
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:16,321
She is so gonna think we
had sex before the wedding,

168
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:17,490
and she'll convince me we did.

169
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:19,832
But we didn't.
Believe me. I'd remember.

170
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:22,360
You don't understand.
This is what she does to me.

171
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,273
She gives me this look, and I get
all panicky and start sweating.

172
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:27,081
Once, at a church picnic,
someone had taken a bite

173
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:29,261
out of six deviled eggs and
put them back on the platter.

174
00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:32,513
My mother accused me of doing it,
and I almost confessed!

175
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,853
- But you hate deviled eggs.
- That's the point!

176
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,731
After she gave me that look,
I wasn't sure.

177
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,213
Maybe I had taken those bites.

178
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,872
She gets in my head.
It's like korean voodoo.

179
00:07:41,118 --> 00:07:44,281
It's gonna be okay. It is.

180
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,121
Whoa... you know what
this picture is?

181
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:48,830
Our first album cover.

182
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:49,930
Zach...

183
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:52,461
Yeah, it's like a
prenatal "Nevermind."

184
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:09,380
Merci...

185
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:12,621
monsieur... bellhop. Jeesh.

186
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:16,121
Did you see that? He literally
sniffed at my tip and sauntered off.

187
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:18,801
Yeah, he sniffed and sauntered.
He did not hop.

188
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:21,240
The bellhop was a gem
compared to the concierge.

189
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:23,361
Isn't it his job to be polite?

190
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,103
You would think the
concierge would be polite.

191
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,993
It's not like we're being
obnoxious and asking someone

192
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:29,193
to take a picture of us in
front of Jim Morrison's grave.

193
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:31,292
Which,  by the way,
I promised Rory we would do.

194
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:33,711
I hope G.G. picks up
the language and the customs,

195
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:35,130
but none of the rudeness.

196
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:37,891
Oh, no, G.G.'s too sweet.

197
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,313
She's got an impenetrable
coat of sweetness around her.

198
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:42,363
You shouldn't have called her G.G., 
you should've called her M&M's.

199
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,901
You were great with
her the whole flight.

200
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,500
You were also great
with Sherry today. Thank you.

201
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:47,872
She was great with me.

202
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:50,343
So, it's not just me, right?
She does seem to have it together?

203
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,820
Yeah, she seems
grounded and sincere.

204
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:55,212
She was nice. I couldn't believe
how prepared for G.G. she was.

205
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:57,513
She was.
She had her favorite "Madeline" book.

206
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:58,792
She knew where the
nearest park was.

207
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,820
And  did you see?
She already had a booster seat.

208
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:03,002
Very impressive. But by the time
I got Rory one of those,

209
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:05,812
she was 60 pounds.
It got stuck on her butt.

210
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:09,461
Oh, my god.

211
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,481
- What?
- We're in Paris!

212
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:13,022
You were thinking
it was Phoenix?

213
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:14,821
I just wasn't
thinking anything.

214
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:17,950
I mean, I was focused on getting G.G.
all settled in.

215
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:22,081
It slipped my mind that we're in the
most beautiful city in the world!

216
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,330
The Phoenix of Europe.

217
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:25,880
First we have to go to Harry's
bar and smoke gauloises cigarettes

218
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,853
and get in a fight about
cubism and gesticulate wildly.

219
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,122
I am going to call our
friend the concierge

220
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:35,151
and make a reservation at the most
romantic restaurant in Paris.

221
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:39,223
Ask him why these beds are
so insanely comfortable.

222
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:41,443
Yes, can I -- No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey!

223
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,581
No sleeping. We are in Paris now.
We are on Paris time.

224
00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:46,743
- Fight the jet lag.
- Fighting the jet lag.

225
00:09:46,757 --> 00:09:48,200
Jet lag strong.

226
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:53,551
Yes, I'm sorry, sir. Could I make
a 8:30 reservation at L'Arpï¿½ge?

227
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes...

228
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:59,660
Uh-huh, I-I understand.

229
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:01,063
Thank you.

230
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:02,982
Did he book it?

231
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:06,060
He did. He also
reminded us to wear shoes.

232
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:08,283
I sense he has a very
low opinion of americans.

233
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:09,620
Well, the french might be rude,

234
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,981
but they know how to
make a very cozy bed.

235
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:14,191
- Lorelai?
- What?

236
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,960
- I know you're tired.
- A tad.

237
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,331
I know you've been awake for
something like 30 hours...

238
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:19,381
32 1/2.

239
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:21,723
...just to help me make the
transition easier for G.G.,

240
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:23,230
and I really appreciate it.

241
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:24,853
Aww, don't mention it.

242
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:27,551
And I just want to show
you the best possible time

243
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:30,390
that you can have in Paris
because you deserve it.

244
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:33,251
Aww, you're sweet.

245
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:36,383
- Lorelai... Lorelai! Lorelai!
- Okay, all right.

246
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,321
Yes, we're gonna get up,
'cause we're in Paris,

247
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:40,061
and we're gonna have
a great parisian time.

248
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:41,233
- We are!
- Yes!

249
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,292
Hey, is the Tour de
France still going on?

250
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:44,923
'Cause we could stand on
a little Paris street

251
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:46,653
and yell "whoo-hoo"
when the guys go by,

252
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,680
or I could pour a cup of water on
one of them as he goes whooping by.

253
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:51,882
Actually, the Tour de France
was a couple of months ago.

254
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:54,422
But we are going to a beautiful,
intimate restaurant,

255
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:57,053
and after we finish our meal,
you can throw water on me.

256
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:58,521
Whoo-hoo!

257
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,181
What are you doing right now?

258
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:02,950
Not much.

259
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:05,162
Would you mind swinging by
the library to drop these off?

260
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:07,720
I'd do it, but I just got
cornered by professor Edwards.

261
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:09,381
She wants to meet for
coffee in five minutes

262
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,862
to discuss me being her T.A.
second semester.

263
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,181
I got to start thinking
about life after graduation.

264
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:16,683
Cozying up to professor Edwards
could be a fast pass to a fellowship.

265
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:17,693
I guess that's true.

266
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:18,931
- What about you?
- What about me?

267
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,351
You looking into any fellowships?
Scholarships? Grad schools?

268
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:23,151
Not really. I mean, not yet.

269
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,772
I will, probably.

270
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:28,411
Time's running out. They only give
the Lsat one more time before spring.

271
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,101
Anyway, thanks for
dropping off the books.

272
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,650
I don't mean to make
you run out of your way.

273
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:33,271
I just thought you have a lot of
free time since you don't work

274
00:11:33,305 --> 00:11:34,882
- at the paper anymore.
- That is true.

275
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:35,991
What are you taking,
by the way?

276
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:36,811
Taking?

277
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,522
Just remember,
tricyclic antidepressants

278
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:40,731
are better than your
monoamine oxidase inhibitors,

279
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:42,303
since those are
for panic attacks.

280
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:43,482
It doesn't look like
you're there yet.

281
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:44,862
I have no plans of going there.

282
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:45,623
You will.

283
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,442
I  know when I was finished as editor,
I went into a major tailspin.

284
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:49,282
Can you tell ?

285
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:52,521
You masked it so well with your
generally gloomy disposition.

286
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,760
The first day is hard.
Then it just gets worse.

287
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:56,701
As it happens,
I am totally relieved

288
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,051
that my job at
the paper is over.

289
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,951
Yeah, I did the
denial thing, too.

290
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:03,020
I even tried smiling a lot. That got
old, and I think it made this line.

291
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,233
That'll teach you to smile.

292
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,411
You know, you really shouldn't
be alone at a time like this.

293
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:08,193
Why don't you call your
"girls gone wild" friends?

294
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,732
They seem delightful in a
"get crazy-drunk in Cancun

295
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:12,061
and flash your
breasts" kind of way.

296
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,380
Your take on Lucy and
Olivia is so not them.

297
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:15,943
Whatever. Later.

298
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,620
Oh, and Lexapro is fast-acting,
but side effects

299
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,243
are weight gain and noticeable
drop in sexual appetite.

300
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:23,753
Of course, with Logan gone,
that's moot.

301
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,922
Always a pleasure, Paris.

302
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:45,593
How's the maeun-tang?

303
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:47,020
- Good!
- Yeah!

304
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:48,982
Really good maeun-tang.

305
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:56,201
How was work?

306
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:58,431
- Oh, yeah, my work is good.
- My work is good.

307
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,150
That's good.

308
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:11,661
This is great dinner, mama.

309
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:12,993
I'm glad you like it. 

310
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:15,411
It's been too long since
we had dinner together.

311
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,072
Way too long.

312
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:21,441
I think you've been avoiding me,
and I know why.

313
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,191
- We haven't been avoiding --
- Do not try to fool me.

314
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:24,820
I know what's going on.

315
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:32,413
You have no new music to show me,
and you are ashamed.

316
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:33,911
- Music?
- Yes, music --

317
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,641
the  thing you say you
want to do for a living.

318
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,903
Oh, no, I do!
Yeah, I've been working on some stuff.

319
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:38,971
What kind of stuff?

320
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,001
Actually, I've been experimenting
with different instruments.

321
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:43,280
Like, I've been playing electric
mandolin, which sound really--

322
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,822
Mom, I'm pregnant!

323
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:48,402
We waited until after we were married!
If you don't believe us,

324
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:50,431
we have a note from our doctor,

325
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:52,192
which doesn't prove anything,
but it does!

326
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,492
- Hit me! Hit me!
- Firmly established --

327
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:56,011
- It's my fault! Hit me!
- It happened during the --

328
00:13:56,988 --> 00:14:00,171
A new child is a
great blessing.

329
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,053
Really?

330
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:04,713
Chuka hamnida, Lane and Zach.

331
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:06,521
She says, "congratulations."

332
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:07,522
Really?

333
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:10,441
Then you should say
"chuka hamnida hamnida"

334
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:12,372
Because we're having twins.

335
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,342
- Twins?
- Twins.

336
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:16,620
Oh, that's wonderful.

337
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:20,422
So, monday,
you move in with me.

338
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:24,753
Cool.

339
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:28,301
I must go e-mail this good news
to our relatives in Pusan.

340
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:30,031
They just got wi-fi.

341
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,790
"Cool"?!

342
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:46,933
No! Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no!

343
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:48,791
- What? What?
- Honey, get up! Get up!

344
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,112
I'm up! I'm up! I'm up! I'm up!

345
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,520
What? We got to go, right?
I-I got to shave?

346
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,600
No, not unless
you're a werewolf!

347
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:55,682
What?

348
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:56,972
It's the middle of the night!

349
00:14:56,987 --> 00:14:58,472
- What?
- It's 4:00!

350
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,492
- What's 4:00?
- That. It.

351
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:02,551
- It's 4:00?
- Yes! It's 4:00!

352
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:05,602
We fell asleep! Damn the french
and their comfortable beds!

353
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:08,252
Oh, we must've dozed
off around 7:00.

354
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,183
We just had ourselves
a 9-hour nap.

355
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:12,033
Nine hours?! That's not a nap.

356
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,693
That's a coma.

357
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:15,971
Wow, the city looks
really beautiful...

358
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:17,473
and dead.

359
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:21,593
Ugh, okay -- this place is very
tastefully decorated and everything,

360
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,952
but would it kill them to
put a minibar in here?

361
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,880
- I'm starving.
- Me too.

362
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:29,382
You don't think they're still holding
our table at L'Arpï¿½ge, do you?

363
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:32,020
I'm guessing our table at
L'Arpï¿½ge smells of disinfectant

364
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:34,130
and has two chairs
on top of it.

365
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,872
It's okay, it's okay!
I can fix this!

366
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:40,491
Room service!
What are you in the mood for?

367
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:45,023
Um... I would like a cheeseburger
with a side of cheeseburger,

368
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:48,011
and see if they can make me
a cheeseburger smoothie.

369
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:50,410
Well, if they can make goose
innards into a tasty spread,

370
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:52,772
I'm sure they can make
a cheeseburger smoothie.

371
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,071
Yes, sir, hi.

372
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,512
I would like to order
some room service.

373
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,012
What'd he say?

374
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,701
He didn't say,
so much as chortle.

375
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:06,130
No room service?
And no minibar?

376
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,393
But two toilets.
Where are their priorities?

377
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:10,431
Okay, let me float
another plan.

378
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,451
Don't say "float" unless
"root beer" is attached to it.

379
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:13,782
It's after 4:00.

380
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:15,280
Why don't we get a
few more hours' sleep,

381
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:18,013
we wake up early,
feast on a delicious french breakfast,

382
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:20,430
and then we hit Paris
totally refreshed.

383
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:22,151
Oh, fine...

384
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:25,261
Crummy Europe.
Crummy time change.

385
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:26,621
We switched to the
metric system --

386
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:28,240
why don't they switch
to our time zone?

387
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:30,413
- We didn't actually switch --
- I know!

388
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,033
Never been so wide awake.

389
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,363
I'm more wide awake.

390
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,753
So wide awake I could watch

391
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:58,040
the Ken Burns documentary
of "Sod" and not drift off.

392
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,710
There are 104 fleur-de-lis
stencil on the ceiling --

393
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:02,103
that's how wide awake I am.

394
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:04,142
I tried humming Brahms'
"Lullaby" in my head,

395
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:05,752
but it kept morphing
into "Purple Rain,"

396
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:07,432
and "Purple Rain" made
me think of grapes,

397
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:09,060
which made me think of grape jam,
which made me think

398
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:11,080
of english muffins
slathered in grape jam.

399
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,323
Hold it -- this is
the greatest city in the world.

400
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:14,972
There is a restaurant out there,
still open,

401
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:17,373
with candles and soft
lighting and great food,

402
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:19,132
and I'm gonna find it for you.

403
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:20,313
My hero.

404
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:22,792
Besides, just being out on the
Paris streets late at night --

405
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,722
what could be more romantic?

406
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,111
Being out on the Paris
streets late at night

407
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:29,383
eating a big, fat cheeseburger.

408
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,192
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Rory.

409
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:48,601
Hey, what's going on?

410
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:50,000
Not a lot. What's up with you?

411
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:52,672
I'm sitting here making a
mobile for my sister's baby.

412
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:54,133
But it's turning
out really good,

413
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:56,771
so I might just keep it for myself
and give the baby a pair of socks.

414
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:58,381
Or make her a mobile
out of socks.

415
00:17:58,398 --> 00:17:59,562
Oh, that's genius.

416
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,603
What's Lucy doing?

417
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:02,613
Watching "Real World: Denver."

418
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,853
Lucy's eating it up with a fork and
spoon 'cause boyfriend's working,

419
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,110
and you know how much
he hates reality TV.

420
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:08,950
Does he?

421
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:11,282
I keep forgetting --
you still haven't met boyfriend.

422
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:13,413
Yeah, I'm beginning to
wonder if he really exists,

423
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:15,492
or if he's just
Lucy's Snuffleupagus.

424
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:16,710
Lucy, it's Rory!

425
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,041
Hey! What's up, girl?

426
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:18,912
Hey, Lucy!

427
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:20,343
Rory says "hey."

428
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:22,010
You guys feel like
doing something?

429
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:23,203
We should go somewhere!

430
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:24,532
Cool, where do you want to go?

431
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:26,630
I want to go to the country,
I want to get off campus.

432
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:28,223
It's the weekend.
Let's get out of here.

433
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,563
I'd so love to go to,
like, a cabin in the woods.

434
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,650
Or just a house.

435
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,531
We could... go to my house.

436
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,650
Yeah?

437
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:37,782
I mean, it's in Stars Hollow.
It's this really small town,

438
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,291
and there's not a lot to do...

439
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:40,711
Oh, my god.
Does your house have a yard?

440
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:41,670
And a porch?

441
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,861
The house has a yard and
a porch with a swing,

442
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:45,632
and the swing makes this
little creaking sound.

443
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,420
That sounds so perfect.

444
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:50,111
When we get there, I'm definitely
mixing up a batch of lemonade

445
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,771
and flirting with Slim,
"The Hired Hand".

446
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:54,290
Slim The Hired Hand is a hottie,
but he's missing a hand.

447
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:55,160
Ironic, huh?

448
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,192
Pick you up in a little bit?

449
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:57,092
We'll be here.

450
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:58,140
Bye.

451
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:13,913
So, class,
the word for "closed" is...

452
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:15,930
You know, after seeing this sign
in seven different restaurants,

453
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,942
it's no longer informative--
It's just mocking.

454
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,230
This place looks good, too.

455
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,420
Even the sound of it -- Fermï¿½.

456
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:23,372
- Let's try around the corner.
- It has a mocking tone.

457
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:26,022
"Ha ha,
fermï¿½." Do you hear that?

458
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,782
I hear a woman who's delusional
with hunger. Come on.

459
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:30,631
See, this is why french
people are so skinny --

460
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,030
'cause they have no
late-night snacks.

461
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,410
How do you explain
Gï¿½rard Depardieu?

462
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:36,892
Oh, that's obvious. Gï¿½rard
Depardieu has hogged all the food.

463
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:41,132
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. Oh, I saw that.

464
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,100
Come on.

465
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,860
What do you say?
You hit him high, I hit him low.

466
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:45,320
Monsieur?!

467
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:46,991
Wait-- attendez!

468
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:48,860
We just want to know where
you got the sandwich!

469
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:50,403
- Oh, look what you did!
- What?

470
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,523
You charged him.

471
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:53,260
Everyone knows you
don't charge a bear

472
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:55,532
or a man with a sandwich.

473
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:59,131
That's a lot of bread.

474
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:01,943
What are the chances there's
a butter truck nearby?

475
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:05,693
Uh, pardonne-moi. Bonsoir.

476
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:08,421
- Nous avons, hungry, hungry...
- I got it. I got it.

477
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:12,521
Funny americans, huh?

478
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,910
Yeah, funny.
Hungry americans, huh?

479
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,070
"Everybody loves Raymond."

480
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:19,180
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

481
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:30,542
Happy people, the french.

482
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:34,871
What?

483
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:36,680
Nothing. It's weird...

484
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:38,920
it's just being this hungry
makes me think of this time

485
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:40,701
when we were in 10th grade,
and, for some reason,

486
00:20:40,736 --> 00:20:43,283
I had to make up this
chemistry exam during lunch,

487
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:46,011
and it went on and on and on forever,
and then finally,

488
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:48,372
when I was done, I came out...

489
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:51,070
and there you were,
waiting for me.

490
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:54,790
And you took this slice of
pizza from the cafeteria

491
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:57,602
out of your coat pocket,
and you gave it to me.

492
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:59,933
Pepperoni -- I remember.

493
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:03,530
Even then, you were so sweet.

494
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:09,730
Head back to the hotel?

495
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:17,132
You don't still have that
pizza anywhere, do you?

496
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:19,413
- Different coat.
- Darn!

497
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,662
Babe, could you
check on my order?

498
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:30,180
Oh, I did. I asked Luke where it was,
and Luke said,

499
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:31,791
"from now on,
if Zach wants to eat here,

500
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:33,590
he has to stand on his head
in the middle of the diner

501
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,872
and eat out of a rusty bucket."

502
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:36,952
So I said, "cool!"

503
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,880
I couldn't help it, Lane!
I was so relieved

504
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,931
that your mother wasn't pissed
off about the pregnancy.

505
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:43,842
"Cool" just came out,
like a happy vocal burp.

506
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:45,872
Next time, cover your mouth!

507
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,280
Jeez!

508
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:49,313
Kirk, what are you doing?

509
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:50,882
Trying to feel a kick.

510
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:53,612
You're gonna feel a kick if you
don't get your hand off my stomach.

511
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:56,522
So, I don't know if you've decided where
you're gonna drop this little load,

512
00:21:56,555 --> 00:21:59,400
but I highly recommend Woodbury
Memorial, where I was born.

513
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,280
Good to know.

514
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:02,340
The maternity suites
there are primo,

515
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:05,842
and they let the mother hold the baby
post-delivery as long as she wants.

516
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,491
Explains a lot about the relationship
between me and my mother.

517
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,250
- Yes, it does.
- Kirk, go away

518
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:12,642
and stop harassing
my employees.

519
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:14,690
You should sit awhile.

520
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,383
No, I'm fine!
Standing's no problem.

521
00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:19,302
All right, but from now on,
no more serving heavy food --

522
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:22,000
your meat loaves, your bowls of stew.
Somebody who orders that--

523
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:23,741
let Caesar carry it.
He needs the workout.

524
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:26,040
- Well, that's not really --
- And if you have any questions

525
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:29,143
or are worried about anything
having to do with...

526
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,583
you know, what's going on there,
I'll call my sister, Liz --

527
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:32,861
she's a veteran.

528
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:34,491
Thanks, Luke.

529
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,471
Anyway, uh...

530
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:38,813
you two are gonna be great.

531
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,553
You'll be great parents.

532
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,031
Zach...

533
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:49,822
we're gonna be parents.

534
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:53,753
Yeah, it's like...
we're not just kids anymore.

535
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:56,163
We're one of them now.

536
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:58,660
Parents don't have to
be told what to do.

537
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,361
Parents do the telling.

538
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,600
That's right.

539
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:04,491
Besides, if we say no,
what's the worst your mother could do?

540
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:11,062
Seriously, b-babe,
w-what is the worst she could do?

541
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:14,152
Yeah.

542
00:23:14,597 --> 00:23:15,792
What, "yeah"?

543
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,853
That's what I'm talking about.

544
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:19,211
Yeah?

545
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:20,793
I'll say.

546
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:23,053
I can barely talk.

547
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,271
Uh-huh, which is, uh...

548
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:27,023
Saying something?

549
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:31,932
I could just live in
this room forever.

550
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:33,381
Let's.

551
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:35,063
- Except--
- No "except."

552
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:36,712
It's decided. Call the guy.

553
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:38,411
Come seal the doors.

554
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:40,792
- I'm too hungry!
- Me too.

555
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:42,761
My stomach is a pit.

556
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:45,911
I know. If I don't eat something,
my stomach's gonna eat me.

557
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:47,840
We need to find food!

558
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:49,160
We do!

559
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:52,381
Look at that view.

560
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:54,640
It's so beautiful,
I could eat it.

561
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:58,671
- Oh, my god.
- What?

562
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,631
- I could totally fix this!
- How?

563
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:02,343
I'm not gonna tell you.

564
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:03,741
- Let's shower.
- Tell me.

565
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:04,921
- It's a surprise.
- Tell me.

566
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:06,221
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Come on!

567
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:07,513
Not telling.

568
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,621
Is this your fix?

569
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:11,773
To get me to think
about what your fix is

570
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,572
instead of thinking
about food, huh?!

571
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:14,920
- Is it working?
- A little.

572
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:17,030
All I can tell you is it's
bigger than a breadbox.

573
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:18,743
Mmm, bread.

574
00:24:18,755 --> 00:24:20,733
- Come on!
- Okay!

575
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:22,102
There's Dean.

576
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:23,662
Ooh, Dean is smokin'.

577
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:25,292
Oh, yeah. Dean's a fox.

578
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:26,501
- He looks tall.
- He is.

579
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:28,000
How can you tell from
a picture of his face?

580
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:29,552
- It's a talent I have.
- Spooky.

581
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,362
Yeah, right, I figure I'll be
recruit by the FBI any day now.

582
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:34,353
It's a very specific specialty.

583
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:35,901
Wait, there you are.

584
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:38,301
Oh yeah. That was my first
year at the Chilton paper.

585
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:40,261
Look at you and your
big Rory smile.

586
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:41,632
What are you there -- 5'2"?

587
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,831
More like 5'7".

588
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:44,351
Are you sure?
You don't look like 5'7".

589
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:47,160
I'm sure. Is this dye supposed
to smell all vinegary?

590
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:48,430
Mm-hmm. It means it's working.

591
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,672
I feel like an easter egg.

592
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:51,761
Boyfriend is gonna totally
freak when he sees this color.

593
00:24:51,797 --> 00:24:53,160
- Freak, like, be mad?
- No.

594
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:55,472
First, he'll be like,
"whoa," and then like, "I like it,"

595
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,822
and I'll be like,
"thanks," and he'll be all,

596
00:24:57,838 --> 00:24:59,762
"I thought you looked
pretty good before, too,"

597
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:01,871
and I'll be like,
"better?" And he'll be like,

598
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:03,741
"No, I think you look good
no matter what you do,"

599
00:25:03,775 --> 00:25:05,560
and I'll be like,
"what if I got a mohawk?"

600
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:07,462
and he'll be like,
"even if you had a mohawk,"

601
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:09,623
and then we'll look at each other
all goony-eyed, and we'll kiss,

602
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:11,611
and he'll say,
"don't get a mohawk."

603
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,033
And too bad if he
doesn't like it.

604
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:14,942
Serves him right for
working all the time.

605
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,361
Boyfriend's got great hair.

606
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:18,462
Oh, the best.
It's, like, beyond human.

607
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,951
Like, Conan O'Brien's?

608
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,442
No, it's, like, really full.

609
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,770
It's more like a
cartoon character.

610
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:25,361
Yeah, it's like Snap's hair from Snap,
Crackle, and Pop.

611
00:25:25,377 --> 00:25:26,750
Wait, am I thinking of Crackle?

612
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:28,030
Is Crackle the one
who wears a hat?

613
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,933
They all wear hats.
It's like part of their uniform.

614
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,811
Yeah, but one of them wears
it all the way on his head,

615
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:34,170
and one wears it further
back so his bangs swoop out.

616
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:36,301
That's Pop.
The blond one's definitely Pop.

617
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:39,043
Okay, so boyfriend's got the color
of Crackle and the style of Pop.

618
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:40,611
Ooh! We should make
Rice Krispy treats.

619
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,111
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yes!

620
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:46,142
I think there is a cake
pan in that broom closet.

621
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:46,973
Broom closet?

622
00:25:46,988 --> 00:25:49,723
Yeah, my mom's not really
into baking or brooms.

623
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,872
Okay, so the butter's
in the fridge,

624
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:54,481
and I will get the marshmallows
and the Rice Krispies.

625
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:57,672
Oh, my god!
Come here, you guys!

626
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,861
It's Rory through the ages.

627
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:02,242
Oh, I totally forgot
that was there.

628
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:05,823
How cool is this? Can you believe
you were this short in 1991?

629
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:06,431
No.

630
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:08,441
Check it out.
The next year, you shot up like a weed.

631
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:09,990
That's when I
finally quit smoking.

632
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:12,871
This is awesome. You have a record
here of you literally growing up,

633
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:14,823
and here you are when you're,
like, 7,

634
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:17,263
and then here you are when you're
ready to graduate college.

635
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:18,582
Yeah.

636
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,170
It's freaky.

637
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:22,162
Oh! There's the cake pan.

638
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:24,081
Let's get cookin'!

639
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:28,373
Well, well,
what do you know? Fermï¿½.

640
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:31,371
Listen, honey,
if they weren't open at 11:00,

641
00:26:31,387 --> 00:26:33,151
I don't think they're gonna be
open at 5:00 in the morning.

642
00:26:33,187 --> 00:26:34,081
Trust me.

643
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:36,103
Trust is not the point.

644
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:38,073
The point is food
and finding some,

645
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:41,780
not standing in front of
closed restaurants feel--

646
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:44,091
Monsieur Hayden...

647
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:45,471
mademoiselle Gilmore.

648
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:46,732
That's us.

649
00:26:46,747 --> 00:26:48,792
Welcome to L'Arpï¿½ge.

650
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,413
Please come in.

651
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:52,210
Your table is ready.

652
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,022
After you, mademoiselle.

653
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:05,290
Thank you.

654
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:07,691
Thank you.

655
00:27:12,627 --> 00:27:15,352
Thanks. What is this?

656
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,471
I'll give you a moment
to peruse the wine list.

657
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:20,660
Please let me know if
you have any question.

658
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:22,212
Thank you. We will.

659
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:23,823
Merci.

660
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:28,981
Pretty cool, huh?

661
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:30,100
How did you --

662
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:33,270
I'm thinking the '78 Latour.
Sounds like a classic car.

663
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:36,033
Honey, how did you do this?

664
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:37,831
I have my ways.

665
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:39,591
Tell me!

666
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:41,883
- You really want to know?
- Yeah!

667
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:43,193
It might take away
some of the magic.

668
00:27:43,225 --> 00:27:44,620
I'll risk it.

669
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:49,131
Well, I was lying in bed,
and I was thinking about us,

670
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:52,713
and how, when we were 16,
we planned our trip to Paris,

671
00:27:52,728 --> 00:27:55,280
but it kind of got derailed.

672
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:56,961
I'll say.

673
00:27:56,978 --> 00:28:00,413
And then I was thinking about how
amazing it is that after everything --

674
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:03,950
the years, the distance,
the screw-ups, everything --

675
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,343
we finally managed to make it
here and how, in some ways,

676
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:10,852
it feels like nothing has
changed and no time has passed.

677
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,053
I know.

678
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:16,600
But then I started thinking about
all the things that have changed.

679
00:28:16,615 --> 00:28:19,061
When did you do
all this thinking?

680
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:22,671
And I realized the one
big thing that has changed

681
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:26,351
is that now...
I'm totally loaded.

682
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:27,783
Okay.

683
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:30,103
And I guess, in some ways,
I'm not quite used to it

684
00:28:30,115 --> 00:28:32,010
because I didn't
even think earlier

685
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:34,760
that I might be
able to use that.

686
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:37,563
You totally bribed
them to open.

687
00:28:37,577 --> 00:28:40,810
Not bribed --
gave financial incentive.

688
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:42,510
Oh, my god!

689
00:28:42,758 --> 00:28:43,602
I know.

690
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:45,673
You totally bribed
them to open!

691
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:48,953
You don't have to whisper.
Everybody here knows.

692
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:53,842
I just can't believe that
people really... do this.

693
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,292
Apparently.

694
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:57,271
- Cool!
- Right?

695
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:59,241
And I was prepared to do
other things to get you fed.

696
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:02,253
I mean, I had backup plans that
included theft and chicanery.

697
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:04,403
Ooh. Chicanery? For me?

698
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:06,173
Anything for you.

699
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:07,980
Anything.

700
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:10,653
So, you happy?

701
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:12,752
Really happy.

702
00:29:13,358 --> 00:29:15,131
This is wonderful.

703
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,112
You didn't have to do it,
you know?

704
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,463
I wanted to.

705
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:21,511
I would've been happy
with a croissant.

706
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:23,580
Or a park bench. I know.

707
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,391
Why a park bench?

708
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:28,031
Remember when we were 16
and planning to go to Paris?

709
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,261
We always said we'd
sleep on a park bench.

710
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:32,183
Oh, yeah!

711
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:35,121
Well, because we didn't have any money,
so we couldn't afford a hotel,

712
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:37,513
we'd have to sleep
on a park bench.

713
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:39,862
I can't believe
you remember that.

714
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:43,853
I'd still sleep on a
park bench with you.

715
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:46,053
Name the bench.

716
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,662
Compliments of the chef...

717
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:53,600
langoustine on a bed of mush
and candied carrot cannelle.

718
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:55,413
Have you decided on the wine?

719
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:58,493
Yes. We're gonna go
with the '78 Latour.

720
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,293
Excellent choice, monsieur.

721
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:06,760
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

722
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:10,320
So, this fix?

723
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:12,173
Not only bigger
than a breadbox,

724
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:13,730
also a lot better.

725
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,252
Told you.

726
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:17,593
Hey, when we're done,

727
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:20,643
can we go back to
that beautiful bed?

728
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,332
You don't want to
sleep on a park bench?

729
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:24,462
Mmm... no park bench.

730
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:26,901
Thank god.

731
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:39,673
Oh yes, this is very nice.

732
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:42,833
So, mama, the reason we wanted
to talk to you is 'cause --

733
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:44,893
If you're wondering about your room,
it isn't ready yet.

734
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,381
We weren't wondering -- mama!

735
00:30:47,397 --> 00:30:49,163
You want two separate
beds, correct?

736
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:50,810
Well, that's not
really the issue.

737
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:52,060
Better for Zach to
have his own bed.

738
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:54,561
Soon, you will be giant.
Who can sleep with that?

739
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:57,881
Mama, could you stop for a minute?
We really need to talk.

740
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,150
I have to unload this shipment.
I may be old, but I can multitask.

741
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,630
The thing is, Mrs. Kim,

742
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:05,922
when you said that we should move
in with you and I said, "cool,"

743
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:08,490
what I meant was,
"that's cool...

744
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:11,012
that you're offering to
have us move in, but...

745
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:11,993
no."

746
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:13,460
What do you mean, "no"?

747
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:15,863
We really appreciate
the offer, mama,

748
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,792
But Zach and I are going to be
parents soon, and we're adults...

749
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:21,162
You know, young adults.
Not like I'm gonna be smoking a pipe,

750
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:23,213
and she's gonna be all, "hey,
let's watch '60 minutes.'"

751
00:31:23,245 --> 00:31:25,230
...and we're gonna be
starting our own family,

752
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:29,440
and it's important to us that
we do that in our own home.

753
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:33,532
We can do this, mama.
We're ready.

754
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:38,802
Very well.
I respect your decision.

755
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:45,831
Cool!

756
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,053
How much do you love this hair?

757
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:49,243
So much!

758
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:51,452
Okay, now we're gonna have
to start a girl band.

759
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,492
We so have to.

760
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:54,051
We'll pretend we're a
norwegian girl band,

761
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:56,013
and we can purposely
lip-synch just slightly off.

762
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:57,683
- Oh, we'll be famous!
- We'll be huge!

763
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,230
You can write articles about
us in the Yale Daily News.

764
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:00,873
Yeah.

765
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:03,952
You can say things like, we're the
hottest thing to come out of
Norway since...

766
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,250
what came out of Norway?

767
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:08,161
Well, we got the vikings,
we got Edvard Munch,

768
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,001
and that's all I got.

769
00:32:10,018 --> 00:32:12,010
I mean, you still have an
in at the newspaper, right?

770
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:14,761
Sure she does. It's like once you're
president, you're president forever,

771
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:16,120
unless you get assassinated.

772
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,610
Actually, it's good Rory's
not editor anymore.

773
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:20,411
More time to be in "The
Forbidden Fjords."

774
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:21,530
Okay, yeah. Wait.

775
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:22,903
We need to discuss the name.

776
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:25,571
Rory, where are you on
"The Forbidden Fjords"?

777
00:32:26,618 --> 00:32:28,351
Oh, my god.

778
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,440
Rory, are you okay?

779
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:32,171
- I'm fine.
- Do you hate your hair?

780
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:33,581
- 'Cause you can change it.
- So easy.

781
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:36,220
No, no, no, I love my hair.

782
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:38,382
It's -- it's nothing.
It's stupide.

783
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:40,730
- It's not nothing.
- What is it?

784
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:44,993
Everything is just... ending.

785
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:48,080
I just feel like everything
is gonna be over.

786
00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:49,452
I'm done at the paper.

787
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,941
Soon I'm gonna be done at Yale,

788
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:53,113
and it's just like I'm
standing on this cliff,

789
00:32:53,126 --> 00:32:55,520
looking out into
this huge, foggy...

790
00:32:55,537 --> 00:32:56,830
Abyss?

791
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:58,902
...like, a huge, foggy abyss,

792
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:02,432
and in my whole life,
there's never been an abyss.

793
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:03,562
It's been abyssless.

794
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:06,533
I've always known exactly
what is in front of me,

795
00:33:06,547 --> 00:33:09,090
and I've always known
exactly where I'm going,

796
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:10,590
and now...

797
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:12,402
I don't know what's out there.

798
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:13,591
Besides fog.

799
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:16,761
A ton of fog, and I hate not
kwowing what is out there.

800
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:18,741
I mean,
what's going to happen to my career

801
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:22,193
and my relationship with
Logan and the rest of my life?

802
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:23,803
Rory...

803
00:33:25,148 --> 00:33:27,652
I'm so sorry,
I don't mean to...

804
00:33:27,668 --> 00:33:29,573
drag everything down.

805
00:33:29,585 --> 00:33:31,203
I so know what you're
talking about.

806
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,500
Totally!

807
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:34,223
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

808
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:36,000
Once I move that tassel
to the other side,

809
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:37,730
I have no idea what
the hell I'm gonna do.

810
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:40,282
I mean, besides that FBI gig.

811
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:41,540
I'm an art major --

812
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:44,420
not like that's an obvious road
sign to the rest of my life.

813
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:46,512
I can't believe you
guys worry about this.

814
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,780
I mean,
you're so carpe diem-ish.

815
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:51,730
How could you not be
worried about it?

816
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:53,660
Everywhere you turn on campus,
someone's talking

817
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:55,453
about their brilliant
plans for next year.

818
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,660
Even our friends that were
really cool on laid-back --

819
00:33:57,678 --> 00:33:59,513
english majors,
philosophy majors --

820
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:01,822
they're talking about
coming investment bankers.

821
00:34:01,837 --> 00:34:03,552
- When did that happen?
- Traitors.

822
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:06,293
The other day, somebody used the
phrase "negative amortization."

823
00:34:06,307 --> 00:34:08,183
What the hell is that?!

824
00:34:13,175 --> 00:34:15,921
I have no idea what I'm doing.

825
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:20,670
Maybe I should be
applying to grad schools.

826
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:21,962
I mean...

827
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:24,503
journalism school
or law school.

828
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:26,192
Maybe I should go
to law school.

829
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:28,590
Dude, you don't want
to go to law school.

830
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:31,223
So don't want to
go to law school.

831
00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:39,313
You're amazing.

832
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,610
No, you are.

833
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:43,033
Don't start a fight with me.
I'm trying to say thank you.

834
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:44,342
You're welcome.

835
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:47,162
I mean, this is ridiculous.
This is incredible.

836
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:48,743
Here we are just
finishing dinner,

837
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:51,150
and the sun is coming up and
people are just going to work.

838
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:52,752
I mean,
it's just all so unreal.

839
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:55,572
I feel like any minute the
waiters could break into song.

840
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:57,301
Well, if you want...

841
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:01,243
What?

842
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:03,203
I'm just so happy.

843
00:35:03,216 --> 00:35:05,042
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

844
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:06,750
I don't ever want
to leave Paris.

845
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:07,702
I know.

846
00:35:07,715 --> 00:35:10,301
I don't want it to be over,
I don't want it to end.

847
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,493
It doesn't have to end.
When we get back to Stars Hollow,

848
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,330
we can sleep all day and wander the
town in the middle of the night, and...

849
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:18,442
that stuff we did back
in the hotel room --

850
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:21,842
we can definitely do that
back in Stars Hollow.

851
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:23,720
Are you saying we'll
always have Paris?

852
00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:25,751
I'm saying I love you, Lorelai.

853
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:27,592
I love you, too.

854
00:35:27,937 --> 00:35:30,033
- And, Lor?
- What?

855
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:34,773
Remember when I told you that I
would wait till we were both 80

856
00:35:34,785 --> 00:35:36,810
for you to figure out us?

857
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:40,922
U-us?

858
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:42,963
You and me?

859
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:44,843
Right.

860
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:48,071
I don't want to wait.

861
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:53,382
- Chris...
- I mean it.

862
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:57,393
But don't you think it's --
it's too soon?

863
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:58,703
No.

864
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:00,662
We've only been
dating a few months.

865
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:01,951
Try 25 years.

866
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:03,442
I know,
but you know what I mean.

867
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,623
So it's taken us this long to
work it out, to figure it out,

868
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:07,561
but we're here now.
We're ready.

869
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:10,981
We're finally ready. Let's do it.
Let's do it right here in Paris.

870
00:36:10,998 --> 00:36:12,340
No, not here.

871
00:36:12,356 --> 00:36:14,241
- Why not?
- Well, Rory...

872
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,220
Rory? Rory will be thrilled.

873
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:20,171
Honey, I love you,
I really do, but...

874
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,860
I think we should wait.

875
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:24,220
Come on, Lor.

876
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:26,800
We love each other.
We belong together.

877
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:28,633
What do you say?

878
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:31,131
Marry me.

879
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,520
No.

880
00:36:35,536 --> 00:36:38,173
But those are cool names,
and whenever we call for "Marco,"

881
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:41,341
Polo would answer with his name,
so we'd always know where he was.

882
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,583
No.

883
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:45,122
We don't even know if
they're going to be boys.

884
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,500
- Mama!
- This place is a death trap!

885
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:49,780
- What are you doing?
- We must think like a baby.

886
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:51,920
Anything that can be grabbed
with little baby hands

887
00:36:51,935 --> 00:36:54,531
must be put up high or
locked away in cupboards.

888
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:56,663
- How'd she get in?
- Who couldn't get in?

889
00:36:56,677 --> 00:37:00,290
Hiding a key under the mat is like
hosting a burglars-only open house.

890
00:37:00,308 --> 00:37:02,182
Mama, we're gonna
baby-proof the apartment,

891
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:03,542
but we've still
got like months.

892
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:05,132
Of course,
the drum kit has to go into storage,

893
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:07,202
and you must throw
away all of these.

894
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:08,301
My guitar picks?

895
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:09,673
To you, they are guitar picks.

896
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,473
To a baby, they are candy
waiting to be choked on.

897
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:15,250
That's true. One time,
I was tuning to an open "e"

898
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:16,822
and holding a pick
between my teeth,

899
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,173
and Brian made this really funny sound,
and I snorted a laugh,

900
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:21,483
so the pick went shooting
to the back of my throat.

901
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:23,013
Mama, did you shop for us?

902
00:37:23,028 --> 00:37:25,982
Yes, and I will cook dinner as
soon as I am finished unpacking.

903
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:28,371
- Unpacking?
- My things.

904
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:30,010
You are right.
You are adults now.

905
00:37:30,027 --> 00:37:31,980
You should raise your
children in your own home.

906
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:33,920
It would be wrong for
you to move in with me,

907
00:37:33,936 --> 00:37:36,133
so I will move in with you.

908
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:37,410
Cool?

909
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:40,261
Mama?

910
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:41,631
Where's Brian?

911
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:44,220
Don't worry about Brian.
Brian is fine.

912
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,893
Um, could you please
pass the bulgogi?

913
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:52,323
- French fries.
- Yep.

914
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,631
Definitely french fries.

915
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:55,933
Even if I haven't even gone
within a mile of one...

916
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:57,842
Always smell like french
fries after a road trip.

917
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,543
Smell like, feel like, a thin layer
of vegetable grease all over me.

918
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:05,940
- Boyfriend!
- Hey!

919
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:08,350
- I think boyfriend's here.
- No way.

920
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:11,770
So once we saw the hair,
it was obvious -- girl band.

921
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:14,180
Rory has the most awesome house.
You have to meet Rory.

922
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:17,573
Rory... this is boyfriend.

923
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,931
- Oh! I --
- Actually, it's Marty.

924
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:21,560
Nice to meet you.

925
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:23,610
You too.

926
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:27,571
Okay... I got to show the dresses you're
talking about for our norwegian band.

927
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:28,970
So perfect. Go get yours.

928
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:31,121
You're going to be, like,
"we have to wear these dresses."

929
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:33,981
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

930
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:37,432
Um... why did you just pretend
like you didn't know me?

931
00:38:38,946 --> 00:38:40,911
I just thought it
would be weird.

932
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:42,620
Weird? That we were friends?

933
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:43,831
Why would that be weird?

934
00:38:43,846 --> 00:38:46,972
Well, what's the difference?
I mean, it's not important.

935
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:48,241
But...

936
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,933
yeah, but we used to
hang out all the time.

937
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:52,440
Ta-da!

938
00:38:52,655 --> 00:38:54,750
Give it up for The
Forbidden Fjords!

939
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,173
- Aren't these perfect?
- They are. They're perfect.

940
00:38:57,187 --> 00:38:59,200
Two Halloweens ago,
Lucy and I went to a party

941
00:38:59,216 --> 00:39:01,812
as "And Dawn,"
without Tony Orlando.

942
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:03,012
Do you like me in this dress?

943
00:39:03,027 --> 00:39:06,040
Yeah. You look nice and shiny.
Goes great with your hair.

944
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:07,680
Thank you. Was I right?

945
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:09,323
Doesn't boyfriend
have unreal hair?

946
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:10,443
He does.

947
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:13,293
- So, the road trip --
- Was so far out?

948
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:15,683
The town where Rory grew up is,
like, your perfect small town.

949
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:17,363
You expect professor
Harold Hill to move there

950
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,191
and sucker everyone into
buying band instruments.

951
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:22,713
It's, like, ideal, but not scary,
"a serial killer lives next door" ideal.

952
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,413
4-h club ideal.

953
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:40,803
Bonsoir, house.

954
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:42,561
Feels good to be home, huh?

955
00:39:42,577 --> 00:39:44,040
So good.

956
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:46,583
It's funny when you go away,

957
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:48,231
even on a short trip...

958
00:39:48,246 --> 00:39:50,492
everything looks a little
different when you get back.

959
00:39:50,505 --> 00:39:51,663
Yep.

960
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,593
Of course, now I'm seeing it
with a french perspective.

961
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:56,870
How's it look in french?

962
00:39:56,888 --> 00:39:59,100
American and dusty.

963
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:02,220
I'm gonna go get the
rest of our stuff.

964
00:40:04,207 --> 00:40:06,623
Welcome home, Mrs. Hayden.
