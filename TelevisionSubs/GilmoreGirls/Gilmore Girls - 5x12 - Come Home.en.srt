1
00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:04,056
Hey. You built me a shelf. That's so nice.

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:07,246
It was anything but nice. I kept using your crazy toothpaste.

3
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:08,418
There's nothing crazy about my toothpaste.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,508
- It's cinnamon.
- So what?

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,265
I don't like cinnamon. I like normal flavored.

6
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:13,333
What exactly is this normal flavor?

7
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:16,061
- You know, striped.
- Striped. That's not a flavor.

8
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:17,450
It is in the toothpaste world.

9
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,691
Ooo, the toothpaste world. Is that anything like Whoville?

10
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:24,014
- I'm exhausted.
- I'm exhilarated.

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,812
You know, you don't have to do this.

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,993
Hey. Going to bed early every once in a while is good for ya.

13
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,937
I have to get up at four. You don't.

14
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:33,982
Yes, I know, but every night you have early deliveries is a night we spend apart

15
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:35,540
and seriously, where's the good in that?

16
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:37,014
Okay.

17
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:42,027
- ‘Night.
- Night.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,810
Man, is it quiet. Do you hear how quiet it is?

19
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,231
Do you have a pin, 'cause I want to hear it drop.

20
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:00,228
- No pins.
- Okay. Sorry.

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,444
So, okay. Good night.

22
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:13,606
Hey, Luke. Why don't you have a T.V.?

23
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,143
I have a T.V.

24
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,886
No, I mean, in here, in the bedroom so you can watch T.V. in bed.

25
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:22,843
I don't watch T.V. in bed. Studies show that it's not good for your sleep.

26
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:23,822
What studies?

27
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:26,828
Watching T.V. in bed screws up your REM sleep.

28
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:30,180
But Charlie Rose, Jon Stewart, Pink Lady and Jeff?

29
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,783
All screw up your REM sleep.

30
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,453
How does Charlie Rose screw up your REM sleep?

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,833
Because he's always got some guy on pushing a book about

32
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,562
how everything's all going to hell, or they're going to pass a law,

33
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:42,658
how everyone with a nose ring is going to get shipped off to China.

34
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:45,612
Suddenly you're depressed, thinking we're all going to die

35
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:48,572
and don't drink the water, there's anthrax in my bagel...

36
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:50,133
and bam, there goes your REM sleep.

37
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:54,092
Or Mel Brooks is on, and he is so funny, and you think,

38
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:57,947
"What a wonderful world we live in, that there's a Mel Brooks to go to sleep to. "

39
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:01,520
Mel Brooks is never on Charlie Rose, and when he is on he's talking about Nazis,

40
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,614
and then you go to sleep and you dream about Nazis

41
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:06,425
and they all look like Nathan Lane, and you're creeped out for days.

42
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,400
You know what ruins your REM sleep, is those articles about REM sleep.

43
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:12,491
And you know what could help you forget those articles about REM sleep?

44
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:13,223
What?

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,474
A television.

46
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,869
- Say goodnight, Gracie.
- Goodnight, Gracie.

47
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:24,551
- Move butt, please.
- In a minute.

48
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,923
- What's wrong with Doyle?
- Mitchum Huntzberger just left.

49
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,900
- Logan's dad?
- My entire body is numb.

50
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,486
- What was he doing here?
- What was he doing here?

51
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,401
Busting my chops, which are now numb.

52
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:37,003
- Oh my God, my chops are completely numb!
- Don't speak, don't speak.

53
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:41,484
So Mitchum Huntzberger stopped by just to make various parts of Doyle's body insensate?

54
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:42,784
He's a deep-pocket alumnus.

55
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:46,102
Every few months Yale reels guys like him in for banquets and luncheons.

56
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,471
And he's going to New York to throw some party for Seymour Hersh on Friday night.

57
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:50,377
A little faster?

58
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:53,091
Seymour Hersh? The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh? Wow.

59
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:54,658
The man owns thirteen newspapers.

60
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:57,602
He's my best contact in the business and I fell like a house of cards.

61
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,264
I made that joke about Abu Grab. God, that was inappropriate.

62
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,656
It wasn't supposed to be a ha ha, funny Abu Grab joke.

63
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:03,741
Stop beating yourself up.

64
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:06,526
Then he busted me on the fact that Logan hasn't had a by-line all year,

65
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,753
wants me to light a fire under him and get him to write.

66
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:11,047
"I'd like to hand the business over to my son, Doyle,

67
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,476
so it'd be nice if he knew something about it. "

68
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:14,647
He's going to pass his empire on to that playboy cad

69
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:17,319
while a rising star such as Doyle is standing right before him.

70
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,782
In a pool of my own sweat. See, it's kind of a minus.

71
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,072
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

72
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:22,956
Now I'm Logan's journalistic Godfather,

73
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,644
and I can't even get the punk to show up, never mind write a story.

74
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,734
- Do you even know if he can write?
- Oh, he can write.

75
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:29,162
He's actually an excellent writer.

76
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:31,563
How's that for God giving with both hands, huh?

77
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:34,569
Every now and then, usually when he gets the flu or the clap, and can't party,

78
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,959
he'll throw us a bone and write something. It's always good.

79
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:39,059
Damn good. Stupid bastard.

80
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:42,290
Well, you are his editor, Doyle. Talk to him. Assign him something.

81
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:46,021
I did. He's supposed to cover the student uproar over Assistant Professor Warrick resigning.

82
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:46,693
And?

83
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,374
And he said thank you, left the room,

84
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,407
and I heard him laughing all the way down the hall. I haven't seen him here since.

85
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,204
I don't know what to do.

86
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,675
Um, Doyle, I just finished that piece on the dissatisfaction of the faculty with the tenure system,

87
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:01,709
and I bet a lot of my notes would overlap with Logan's story.

88
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:02,974
Point, Gilmore, point?

89
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,232
If you want, I could arrange to get together with Logan.

90
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:07,761
Share my notes with him. Maybe it could get him started.

91
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:08,949
Really? You'd do that?

92
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:10,469
Sure. I mean, if it would help you out.

93
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:11,973
Gilmore, I am loving you at this moment.

94
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,813
- Moment's over.
- Moment's over. Thanks.

95
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:15,278
Sure, boss. Anything for the team.

96
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:25,200
Okay, everyone remember your time cards.

97
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,637
Punch in, punch out, including lunch and breaks.

98
00:05:27,898 --> 00:05:31,657
Okay, now, next on the agenda is something very exciting.

99
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:35,282
The Dragonfly Inn's first official sexual harassment seminar.

100
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:37,145
Ah, finally. Yes, good, talk to them.

101
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,902
Sexual harassment is bad.

102
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:43,165
So no one touch anyone in any funny places unless specifically asked. Moving on.

103
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:45,271
That's it? That's the seminar?

104
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:50,115
Where's the speech about people not ogling other people like an object of desire?

105
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:53,181
How about explaining that the way some people walk

106
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:55,767
with a sway or a bounce, it is natural.

107
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:58,691
It is because we work out, and we take Pilates, and...

108
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:00,949
No one touch Michel! Moving on.

109
00:06:01,563 --> 00:06:06,162
Uh, Billy, Adam, you've got to remember to securely lock the padlock on the stables,

110
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:10,160
not just hook it on. Cletus has figured out how to push it off with his nose,

111
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,027
and two days in a row I found him at reception.

112
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:16,017
Now if you could just check people in, that would be a different story, but...

113
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,760
until then, um, lock the stable and check the lock and -

114
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,289
Kirk. What are you doing here?

115
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,408
- Staff meeting.
- You don’t work here.

116
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:26,821
I thought I might like to go into hotel management someday,

117
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:28,495
and I figured this was a good place to learn.

118
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:31,167
Oh, Kirk, you can’t just crash a staff meeting.

119
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:34,782
Outsiders cannot crash staff meetings. ”

120
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,221
I’m learning so much.

121
00:06:36,303 --> 00:06:39,349
Okay, anything else to discuss before we wrap it up here?

122
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,418
Yes.

123
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,525
We have a problem with some honor bar discrepancies.

124
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:48,898
For the past few weeks after I have checked a room and found the honor bar intact,

125
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,088
the next day, Toblerones are missing.

126
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:51,657
What?

127
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:54,642
Only Toblerones, and only in certain rooms.

128
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:55,928
I think we have thieves.

129
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:58,666
- Or guests.
- No, these are not the guests.

130
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:01,431
The disappearances are happening in rooms no one is staying in.

131
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:05,291
I think we have thieves and it’s obviously an inside job.

132
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,290
These people are waiting until I’ve made my rounds.

133
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:10,234
They’re waiting until I’ve checked my list, ‘till I initial my list,

134
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:13,613
and only then do they steal the Toblerones.

135
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:14,662
Maybe you counted wrong.

136
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:17,836
I say we install surveillance cameras, fingerprint the staff,

137
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:20,761
run the prints through the FBI and have mandatory searches

138
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:22,905
before they leave at the end of their shift.

139
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:25,952
Oh, well, that sounds great. Everybody drop your pants for Michel before you leave.

140
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:26,920
Meeting adjourned.

141
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,293
No food spread?

142
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:37,154
The staff meetings at Connecticut Light and Power always have a lovely food spread.

143
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,390
Nice bagels, an assortment of schmear.

144
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,722
Hey, Kyon. I’m busy, so quick, what do you got?

145
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,593
Many things.

146
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:51,167
These come house, Mrs. Kim throw directly in trash.

147
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,559
My Sam Ash catalogues! What’s that smell?

148
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,146
They landed in old fish and bok choy.

149
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:56,251
Figures, what else you got?

150
00:07:58,331 --> 00:07:59,785
My old Madonna t-shirt!

151
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:02,830
Mrs. Kim use as rag. Says little horse-face good to scrub scum.

152
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:06,015
I wore this, ironically, by the way. I was never into her. Not my thing.

153
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:06,993
Right.

154
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:08,124
Anything else, Kyon?

155
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:11,203
Overheard conversation. Mrs. Kim having Lunar New Year at her house this year.

156
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:12,841
- She expect you to come.
- Oh, she does?

157
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,522
She says not coming is same as spitting on ancestors and ancestors no like spit.

158
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:18,462
Expects me to come. Unbelievable.

159
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:20,695
After she attacks my boyfriend on the street,

160
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:23,791
damning him to the fires of hell and swimming with carnivorous dogs.

161
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:27,228
And now she expects me to smile and curtsey and just go

162
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,705
to Lunar New Year dinner like nothing happened. Nice, huh?

163
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:33,660
Whoa, I’m not your sounding board. I deliver scoop, you give me Monte Cristo sandwich.

164
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:34,938
Fine. Sit over there.

165
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:39,159
There are some good ones here.

166
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:40,029
Definitely.

167
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,616
Oh, our band pictures! How are they?

168
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:42,445
They’re all good.

169
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:45,103
Except the one of you bending over and looking through your legs.

170
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:46,537
I was just seeing what works.

171
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,466
I like this one.

172
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:50,309
A tree’s covering my face.

173
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:51,852
Come on, dude, the good of the many.

174
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:53,060
What do you like, Lane?

175
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,543
- I don’t like any of them.
- What?

176
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,041
You guys look good, I mean, not the Brian with his face between his legs one,

177
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:01,040
or the profile one where you’ve got your finger in your mouth and the peek-a-boo look...

178
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,782
Right, peek-a-boo! That’s what it is.

179
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:04,026
I was experimenting.

180
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:06,161
- But I don’t look good.
- What are you talking about?

181
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,183
You look totally cool, like a real chick.

182
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:11,594
- I look like the Korean Buddy Holly.
- Buddy Holly was cool.

183
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,086
May he rest in peace, but Buddy Holly was not an attractive man.

184
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:14,994
I find him attractive.

185
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,653
Dude, don’t say every thought out loud.

186
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:17,636
Can we re-take them?

187
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,760
Like thirty-seven dollars just grows on trees?

188
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,062
You’re being too hard on yourself.

189
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,539
Totally. Lame. We’re not Maroon 5 or the Gee Whiz Slicky Boys.

190
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,633
We don’t want to look all fake.

191
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:26,934
No, but halfway decent would be nice.

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,039
Lighten up. They work.

193
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,632
Miss, some more coffee, please?

194
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:31,137
At least she didn’t say mister.

195
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:34,460
The lease on my Mercedes is up next month.

196
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:35,428
Do you want to buy it?

197
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,803
I finally have the seat setting where I like it.

198
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,570
I’ll make the arrangements tomorrow.

199
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:40,886
Thank you, Richard.

200
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:44,639
Now, uh, we need to schedule work on the water heater.

201
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:47,131
Um, I was wondering if Friday morning would work for you?

202
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:48,361
Let me look.

203
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:51,713
They estimate the work to be about an hour, which means they’ll be done in June.

204
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,901
Oh, no, I have a hair appointment Friday morning.

205
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:54,700
For what?

206
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,455
What do you mean for what?

207
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,755
- Your hair looks perfect to me.
- Oh, now.

208
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:02,683
Well, I can arrange for Robert to let the workman in and supervise it if that works for you.

209
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:04,223
Well, that would be fine. Thank you, Richard.

210
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,191
You’re welcome, Emily.

211
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,428
What’s next on the agenda?

212
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:09,374
The Modern Museum gala is coming up.

213
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:11,964
Oh, yes. Martin Forman is being honored this year.

214
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,824
And Sugar Farthington is organizing it.

215
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,475
Well, if Sugar’s organizing it, then of course you should go.

216
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,554
Well, if Martin’s being honored, then you should go.

217
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:19,951
Sugar is one of your closest friends.

218
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,784
Martin is one of your most trusted colleagues.

219
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:25,656
Well, then, perhaps we should both attend.

220
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:27,786
That does seem to be the sensible thing to do.

221
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:29,619
All right. Then we’ll both attend.

222
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:30,469
Fine.

223
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,098
Uh, so, have we discussed the water heater?

224
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:36,311
Yes, we have.

225
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:38,502
Ah. More water?

226
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,111
Hey, Ace.

227
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,940
Hi, Logan. I didn’t see you there.

228
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,051
- Hey. Um, how are you?
- I’m good.

229
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:58,087
Oh, good. Good.

230
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:00,713
Okay, so good. Um, here they are.

231
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:02,557
These are the notes for one story?

232
00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:04,533
Yeah, I’m kind of a note freak.

233
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:07,143
Man, Ace, I’m impressed and partially terrified.

234
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,091
Okay. Well, I’ve divided them up into sections, so

235
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:14,762
interviews, research, statistics. I wasn’t sure what you already had,

236
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:17,511
but I figured there’s something here that can help you with your story.

237
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,992
I hope you’re getting extra credit for this.

238
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:19,975
Oh, it’s nothing.

239
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:23,738
Seems like a lot of work on your part, going through this stuff, organizing it for me.

240
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:26,415
Well, I’m kind of an organization freak, too.

241
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:29,390
Plus, I’m sure it wasn’t your idea to give up your evening like this,

242
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:31,787
to come here and meet me. Was it?

243
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:34,955
Um, I’m just doing a little public service. That’s all.

244
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,476
- Public service?
- Yes.

245
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,194
Doyle looked like he was about to liquefy after your dad talked to him,

246
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:44,207
so I chose to stop that from happening, for the sake of the janitorial staff.

247
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,275
Yeah. He has a thing for by-lines, my father.

248
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,425
Apparently he has plans for you.

249
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,612
Yes. Isn’t that thrilling.

250
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,745
Sorry Doyle took the hit. My dad can be a real bully when he wants to be.

251
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:56,235
He’s a very interesting man.

252
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:57,239
You met him?

253
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:59,752
No, I’ve just… read about him.

254
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:01,391
I mean, he’s a big guy.

255
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:02,763
Maybe you’ll get to meet him someday.

256
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:06,889
Oh, did I show you how I divided these up?

257
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:09,158
Interviews, research, um...

258
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,227
- So how come I never see you around?
- I’m around.

259
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:12,133
Yeah? Where?

260
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:16,255
Class, coffee cart, the student’s store when I run out of thumbtacks…

261
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:18,523
- Wow, thrilling life.
- I’m really not that boring.

262
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,710
Oh, I know you’re not boring.

263
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:23,572
Oh, Doyle told me that your dad is throwing a party for Seymour Hersh?

264
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:24,738
Ah, you want to talk about boring?

265
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:27,323
How can meeting Seymour Hersh be boring? I love him.

266
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:31,267
I read My Lai Four when I was twelve and I’ve been obsessed with him ever since.

267
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:33,211
You read a book about the My Lai massacre when you were twelve?

268
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,066
Well, I polished off Nancy Drew that year too.

269
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:38,204
Well, I guarantee, these parties always turn into a bunch of drunks discussing

270
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,861
stocks, cars and the latest friends to be indicted. It’s boring.

271
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:43,226
I just go, take a date so I have somebody to talk to,

272
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,306
and bail as soon as my dad’s back is turned.

273
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:46,345
Oh, so you’re going?

274
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:47,446
Daddy says.

275
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:49,572
- Wow, lucky.
- No.

276
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,759
To spend the evening with a great writer,

277
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:55,184
and to get to meet him, hear him talk? Very, very lucky.

278
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,713
- You think so?
- Definitely.

279
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,708
Well, maybe this time it won’t be so bad after all.

280
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:04,250
So, do you want to get something to drink or do you have to go?

281
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:06,333
No, I don’t have to go. I don’t have anywhere to go.

282
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,308
Okay. Be right back.

283
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:17,305
Hey, Lane.

284
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:18,376
Hi, Lorelai.

285
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,115
- Hmm. You look different.
- I do?

286
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:24,520
Yeah, you look cute. I mean, you always look cute, but this is just a new facet of your cuteness.

287
00:13:24,623 --> 00:13:26,451
Thanks. You look cute too.

288
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:30,393
I have a boyfriend, so maybe this flirting thing we’ve got going on should just end here.

289
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:31,770
I think so too. Coffee to go?

290
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,886
It’s that special time of day.

291
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:35,535
What was that?

292
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,928
It’s been like that for an hour. It’s the damn oven.

293
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:39,471
- The damn oven?
- Damn oven!

294
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:40,771
What’s up with the damn oven?

295
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:43,162
I bought this damn oven and the thermostat doesn’t work!

296
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:44,964
The damn thermostat or just the thermostat?

297
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:46,530
- Are you being cute?
- Sorry, go on!

298
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:50,350
So I went and I got a new thermostat, and now I can’t figure out how to replace the damn thing.

299
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:52,711
- So it is a damn thermostat.
- I don’t have time for this.

300
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:54,268
Come on! You can do this.

301
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,330
Step at a time here.

302
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:58,881
You pulled the knob off each gas tap on the range, right?

303
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:00,233
Uh, yeah. So?

304
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:03,228
Then you remove the four screws securing the face panel, then you remove the panel.

305
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,347
Yeah, I did that.

306
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:08,077
Hmm. Then you disconnect the oven and gas supply pipe from the outlet of the thermostat?

307
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,627
This is where I got stuck.

308
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:13,621
Did you release the oven sensor retaining clips from the oven lining?

309
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,518
No. No, I didn’t. Okay! Got it!

310
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:18,481
Now just pull the sensor out, you should be rolling now.

311
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,928
- So how, how?
- How what?

312
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:21,992
How do you know this?

313
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,578
Well, I couldn’t get to sleep the other night,

314
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,858
you know, when we went to bed, and so I read your oven manual.

315
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,473
You’re kidding.

316
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:30,004
Well, it was either that or the broiler manual, and the oven won, ‘cause it’s shiny and pretty.

317
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:31,515
You never cease to amaze me.

318
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:32,883
And I never will. Bye, Doll.

319
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,841
And hey, leave the broiler manual out for me.

320
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:39,114
I’m kind of into this whole kitchen appliance genre now, you know? Kitch lit”..

321
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:39,881
All right.

322
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:40,589
Hey there, Zach.

323
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:41,505
Howdy.

324
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:42,693
Hi there.

325
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,480
Well, aren’t we bouncy?

326
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:46,501
- I’m in a pretty good mood.
- Why’s that?

327
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,391
I’m just feeling nice and light.

328
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:50,500
What’s up with your face?

329
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:52,041
Oh, what do you think is up with my face?

330
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,656
- It looks all nude.
- For a good reason.

331
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,057
- You’re not wearing your glasses.
- That’s right.

332
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:57,721
But you’re blind without your glasses.

333
00:14:57,878 --> 00:14:59,072
The wonder of contacts.

334
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,218
- Contacts?
- Contacts.

335
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:01,033
Why?

336
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,738
Why? So I don’t have to wear glasses.

337
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:05,098
So, like, for all the time?

338
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:07,873
Yeah – you okay?

339
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,802
I guess. I mean, that’s a pretty big thing to just spring on a guy.

340
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:11,549
Why?

341
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:12,650
You don’t look like you.

342
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:14,718
Yes, I do. It’s just me, my face,

343
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:17,069
without being impeded by a foreign plastic object.

344
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,550
But you’re the first smart girl I’ve ever gone out with, and the glasses are a big part of that.

345
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:23,351
Well, my I.Q. is still the same. Contacts don’t change that.

346
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:24,780
But you lose that initial impact.

347
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:27,787
Now people will have to talk to you for a few minutes to figure out that you’re smart.

348
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,208
Well, then, that’s what they’ll have to do.

349
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:31,590
Okay. I’ll try to get used to it.

350
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:33,320
Yeah. And you will.

351
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:36,083
I’m sorry, am I supposed to eat my soup without a spoon?

352
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:37,764
Of course she doesn’t think that, okay?

353
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:40,482
She’s really smart, she’s just not wearing her glasses!

354
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,066
You should have heard him, Richard.

355
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:45,975
Oh, I can imagine.

356
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,306
They had him on speakerphone, and when Lori heard him screaming

357
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:50,400
she ran in holding her shoe. She thought I was being attacked.

358
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:52,914
Well, you’re in good hands with that Lori.

359
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,742
I wish I had a secretary who’d defend me with her shoe.

360
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:57,311
Well, he may be mad now, but wait until we go to court.

361
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,266
Well, maybe he’ll settle.

362
00:15:58,393 --> 00:15:59,416
Oh, he’ll never settle.

363
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:01,828
Ah, he will, if we send Lori in with her shoe.

364
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:03,723
He’s certainly got his lawyers working on this.

365
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:06,170
Well, we’re going to have to bring in outside counsel.

366
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:08,526
It’s going to get a little messy. Who’s available?

367
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:09,595
How about Maurice Newson?

368
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,376
No. He over-colognes.

369
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:12,232
Briar?

370
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:14,147
- No. Briar’s on the Delfini case.
- Oh, yeah.

371
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,427
What about Simon McLane?

372
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:19,103
I don’t think you really want Simon on this one, Richard.

373
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:21,520
Why not? He’s always done a top-notch job for us before.

374
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,209
He’s aggressive, he’s not sloppy. He’s very creative.

375
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,102
- Yes, but Richard...
- What?

376
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,622
Well, we just assumed you wouldn’t want to work that closely with Simon anymore,

377
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:31,100
you know, since the whole thing with him and Emily?

378
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:34,564
Ah. Yes.

379
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:39,687
Well, what about Brandt?

380
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,452
- Brandt!
- Brandt. Very good.

381
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:42,855
- Terrific.
- Brandt it is.

382
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:46,121
Well, apparently the whole padlock discussion was a big dud.

383
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:50,423
I just got a call from Mrs. Berg. Cletus is standing in her wading pool. I need carrots.

384
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:51,456
Bottom shelf.

385
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:54,658
Oh, I love it when I talk and no one listens. Makes me think of home.

386
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,390
Okay. I just took the Andersons to room three, I opened the door

387
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,436
and when I went inside I found that the bedspread was mussed!

388
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,321
- The bedspread was mussed!
- Call a cop!

389
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,668
I checked that room personally last night after it had been cleaned. It was perfect!

390
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:08,646
- No muss!
- No fuss!

391
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:11,718
Why are you joking? Why?

392
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,284
Do you not care that people are sneaking into our rooms,

393
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:16,049
mussing the beds, eating the food?

394
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,216
Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right.

395
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:19,734
I know I’m right. I do not need you to tell me I’m right.

396
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:21,492
Okay. So, what do we think is going on here?

397
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:23,985
I believe that our employees are clandestinely using our rooms

398
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:25,961
for sexual encounters on their coffee breaks.

399
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:26,493
Come on.

400
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,772
Lars and Celia seem awfully friendly lately.

401
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,537
You don’t notice them making goo-goo eyes?

402
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:34,035
And Celia has put on weight. Perhaps one too many Toblerones.

403
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:36,192
I don’t think Lars and Celia are having an affair.

404
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:37,435
Hey, maybe we got a ghost.

405
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:40,150
A ghost. That would be cool. People love haunted inns.

406
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:41,501
I wonder what kind of ghost we have.

407
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:42,839
Maybe a Confederate Soldier.

408
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:44,717
Or a lonely spinster that never married.

409
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:45,659
Or Patrick Swayze.

410
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:47,138
In search of his lost career.

411
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:49,826
Maybe we have ghosts having sex and then eating Toblerones.

412
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,398
Ooh, hungry, horny ghosts.

413
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:53,630
I am done with both of you.

414
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,804
I guess I should go up to room three, and see what’s...

415
00:17:57,885 --> 00:17:59,790
Kirk! What are you doing here?

416
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:01,429
I’m assembling the bouquet garni.

417
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:03,589
- I thought you hired him.
- I did not hire him.

418
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:05,658
I thought I might want to work on a kitchen staff someday,

419
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:07,367
and I figured this was a good place to learn.

420
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,074
Kirk, get out!

421
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,993
- Can I at least finish my shift?
- No!

422
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:17,576
- Hello.
- Hey. What’s up?

423
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:18,519
We have ghosts.

424
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:21,008
Well, it’s better than rats. Listen, I need a favor.

425
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,368
- From me?
- Yes, from you.

426
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,351
Oh, well, let me get out my list.

427
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:27,203
Okay, I’ll write this favor down right under the one that says Gave me life”..

428
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,108
Look. I may have a thing Friday

429
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:31,525
which would mean that I have to get out of Friday night dinner.

430
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:32,218
A thing?

431
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:33,745
I was wondering if you could cover for me?

432
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:35,220
What kind of a thing? A man thing?

433
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,398
Possibly a man thing.

434
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,659
Okay, spill. Who is he?

435
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:40,034
I don’t want to jinx it, okay? It’s not a definite.

436
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:42,424
When I know it’s a go I promise I’ll fill you in. Completely.

437
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,985
I can’t believe you’re going to leave me alone with my parents

438
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,137
just so you can have a social life.

439
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:48,950
What happened to the good old days, with the spinster daughter

440
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,712
taking care of the parents and living a lonely, sexless existence?

441
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:54,181
- So you’ll cover for me?
- Yeah.

442
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:55,762
- Thank you. I’ll call you later.
- Bye honey.

443
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:58,793
Hey. I just asked Lars if he was seeing anyone special.

444
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,121
He misunderstood and he might be filing one of those sexual harassment charges against me.

445
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:05,073
And you, ‘cause I said you made me.

446
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:07,469
Hey, hey. Michel! Come back here!

447
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:09,096
I’ll get him.

448
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:13,509
Okay, guys, let’s try it again and let’s try not to suck.

449
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:15,162
We’ll get it. We just have to focus.

450
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,058
By the way, your ‘E’ string is a little flat.

451
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:20,411
Which, by the way, makes it a little bit more rock and roll. Okay, are we ready?

452
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:21,405
I’m down.

453
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,206
Eins, zwei, drei, vier…

454
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:26,464
Hey, could you not do the countdown in German? It’s depressing.

455
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,557
Fine. One, two, three, four.

456
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,450
Who the hell is that?

457
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,032
I hope it’s not my girlfriend’s husband.

458
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,074
Oh, that’s fresh!

459
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:52,652
Mama.

460
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:54,409
You couldn’t even hear me over that noise.

461
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:57,537
That noise is my passion, Mama, and you’re keeping me from it.

462
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:58,786
‘E’ string was flat, too.

463
00:19:58,872 --> 00:19:59,739
What can we do for you?

464
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:02,744
This year I am hosting Lunar New Year dinner. You are to come.

465
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:05,213
- Why?
- You are my daughter. Not coming is humiliation.

466
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,424
Have we forgotten the incident at the newsstand?

467
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:07,893
The what?

468
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:11,202
You yelled at my boyfriend, in public, Mama! What’s that, if it’s not humiliation?

469
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:12,780
- That is in the past.
- Not for me.

470
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:13,722
You must come to this.

471
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,938
Oh, yeah? Well, only if I can bring my boyfriend.

472
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:18,852
- What?
- It’s both of us or neither of us.

473
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,386
- Take it or leave it.
- I have only enough chairs for those invited.

474
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,778
You sell chairs, Mama, you have eight hundred chairs.

475
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:27,878
Fine. Bring boy. But if boy comes, I invite the Parks. They come.

476
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,471
- I hate the Parks.
- You shouldn’t hate the Parks.

477
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:30,936
You hate the Parks. They’re mean.

478
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:31,920
I get to hate the Parks.

479
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,309
Fine. If the Parks come, how about if I bring my whole band?

480
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:37,540
The whole noisy lot of us. How about that? Will that work?

481
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:38,550
- Yes.
- What?

482
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:40,808
- Bring them all!
- The whole band?

483
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,075
Yes. See you then.

484
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:44,416
But...

485
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:51,554
We’re all invited to a party.

486
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:58,078
Here we are.

487
00:20:58,158 --> 00:20:59,802
Are we early? I don’t hear anything.

488
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:02,582
That’s the sound of a couple dozen Christian Koreans partying down.

489
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:03,474
Trippy.

490
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:05,307
Oh, cool. Bok jo ri.

491
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:07,700
They’re used to separate grains of rice from small stones.

492
00:21:07,754 --> 00:21:09,429
They symbolically catch happiness for the New Year.

493
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:10,467
How do you know that?

494
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,936
I’ve done a little internet research on Korean New Year.

495
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,852
Surf the ‘Net, there’s a lot of information there.

496
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:19,206
There’s also a lot of pictures of girls with tattoos on motorcycles.

497
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,943
You would think it gets old, but it doesn’t.

498
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:22,900
Sorry about this.

499
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:24,548
I feel like I’m going to the dentist.

500
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:27,021
That’s not an unusual thing to feel when approaching the Kim house.

501
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:29,105
I just hope I don’t throw up in the bok jo ri.

502
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,558
I’ve got your back, okay? You’re not alone.

503
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:32,760
Are you sure they’re home? There’s not a sound.

504
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,151
I’m sure. Go ahead and knock.

505
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,759
Uh, Gil? The AC/DC ring.

506
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,074
Right. Sorry.

507
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:41,049
- Hello.
- Hello, Mama.

508
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:42,484
I said we’d come and we’ve come.

509
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:43,472
I’m Gil.

510
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:44,747
Yes.

511
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:46,467
And Mama, you know Brian.

512
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:48,643
Say hay boke-mahn he pah du say oh.

513
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:49,739
He likes the internet.

514
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:51,510
And who’s this half-boy hiding behind you?

515
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:53,532
That’s Zach, Mama. You’ve met him too.

516
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:55,836
Happy New Year, I guess.

517
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:57,639
Yes. Come in.

518
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,179
Well, lookie here, the fleet’s in town.

519
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:12,241
Yep. We’re having a little Davey-Daddy night tonight.

520
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:14,740
Just the men being manly. Want to punch me in the stomach?

521
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:15,764
I’ll pass on the punch.

522
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:17,346
Listen, I was wondering if you could do me a favor.

523
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:18,590
I don’t want to pull your finger either.

524
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:20,823
I know now is an important time for you guys.

525
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,792
The inn’s just getting off the ground. There’s a lot of extra work.

526
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:27,438
But if you could just encourage Sookie to ease up a little – delegate.

527
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:28,497
Sookie, delegate?

528
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,831
I know. But with the pregnancy and all?

529
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,029
And I know her hours are generally pretty good.

530
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:34,406
Most nights she’s home by seven.

531
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:36,366
It’s just these new late nights that worry me.

532
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,043
Late nights?

533
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,900
I mean not worry me, worry me. I just don’t want her to overdo it.

534
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:43,612
Oh, sure. Sure. But, Jackson, I think Sookie left before me tonight.

535
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:46,412
Oh, no. She called. She said the new kitchen help’s a little slow.

536
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,634
Whatever. I know she has to do it.

537
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,483
It’s just every week now.

538
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:52,930
It’s no big deal. Just see if you can say something.

539
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,784
Oh. Okay, I’ll see what I can do.

540
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:57,810
Thank you. Okay, son. I think it’s time to get you laid.

541
00:22:57,887 --> 00:22:59,749
Oh, that’s sweet. Bye, boys.

542
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,602
Gretchen, I can still smell the fish from here!

543
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,797
Well, funny running into you here.

544
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:17,823
- You look very nice.
- Thank you.

545
00:23:18,352 --> 00:23:20,660
Do you have the directions? I have an extra copy if you need it.

546
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,792
I’m fine. Thank you.

547
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:24,864
All right. I guess I’ll see you there.

548
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,487
Seems inevitable, doesn’t it?

549
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:46,604
Good eats. Slimy.

550
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:47,868
I’m enjoying it.

551
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:52,385
I like slimy food, ‘cause it slides down easy, and I get the sense it keeps sliding, right?

552
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,952
Which helps your colon and stuff, ‘cause it scrapes as it slides,

553
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,524
and since it’s not in you long, you don’t get fat, you know?

554
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,511
Just eat.

555
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:00,490
You’re not hungry?

556
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,418
Slimy food doesn’t float my boat like it does others.

557
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,890
I’ll be right back. I have to go to the bathroom.

558
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:09,081
You’re not allowed to leave the table.

559
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:10,187
Nature’s calling, kid.

560
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:11,410
Nature must wait!

561
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:16,562
How’s about keeping it down, there, scooter?

562
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:18,066
Sit ‘till we’re done!

563
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:26,474
If I beat the crap out of this little kid, will anyone care?

564
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:28,926
Mama locks the bathroom door while we eat, anyway.

565
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:29,781
Super.

566
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:33,770
We are done eating. There will be a thirty minute break till dessert,

567
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:37,034
while Mrs. Shin and her fellow musicians play for you in the other room.

568
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:39,493
Mrs. Shin, better start setting up.

569
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:42,085
Look at the funky guitar! Awesome!

570
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:43,217
It’s a Gayaguem.

571
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:46,912
And if I’m not mistaken, I believe I spotted a Dahnso and a Janggoo on the way in.

572
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,009
Man, I gotta check this out.

573
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:51,576
Can I get up?

574
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:52,739
Yes.

575
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,164
Yeah, he can get up?

576
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,931
You have much knowledge of Korean culture.

577
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,112
Thanks.

578
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:04,286
That was forward of me. I should retire to my room and sleep.

579
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:05,616
No, don’t do that.

580
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,055
It’s okay.

581
00:25:18,755 --> 00:25:21,090
I can’t believe you’ve never seen the Office!

582
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:22,139
I feel very stupid.

583
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,914
Well, you should. It’s brilliant. Especially the fourth time you see it.

584
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,163
What happens the fourth time you see it?

585
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,529
You can actually understand what they’re saying.

586
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:30,925
I have them all on DVD. You can borrow them if you want,

587
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:33,423
but only if promise to abide by the fourth time rule.

588
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:36,466
I’ll abide by your fourth time rule. If it’s as good as you say, I’ll raise you a fifth.

589
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:37,274
Deal.

590
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:39,003
Oh, here, I almost forgot your notes.

591
00:25:39,244 --> 00:25:40,331
Oh, I hope they helped.

592
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:41,574
They did.

593
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:44,258
Some guy tried to mug me earlier and I beat him to death with them.

594
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:45,528
Hey, I like my research.

595
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:47,253
I like your research too, and thank you.

596
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:48,000
It helped?

597
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,021
Story’s done, Doyle’s safe, all is right with the world.

598
00:25:51,088 --> 00:25:51,846
You’re welcome.

599
00:25:53,493 --> 00:25:54,216
So.

600
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:56,249
So.

601
00:25:57,176 --> 00:25:57,989
It’s been fun.

602
00:25:58,175 --> 00:25:59,239
Yeah. It has been.

603
00:26:00,155 --> 00:26:02,551
Okay, so I should get going. I’m headed to New York.

604
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,724
Right. For your dad’s party.

605
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:05,608
Yep.

606
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:08,419
So...

607
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,203
have a good weekend.

608
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,989
Oh, yeah. You too.

609
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:15,183
Have a good weekend.

610
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,386
And hey, don’t be a stranger.

611
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:27,660
Hey, Kirk.

612
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:28,674
- No messages.
- Super.

613
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:45,392
Oh, behold our ghost.

614
00:26:45,643 --> 00:26:47,244
Okay, this isn’t what it looks like.

615
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,560
I don’t know what it looks like.

616
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:49,964
I’m just watching T.V.

617
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:52,667
Because we have the convenient channel list next to the bed?

618
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:54,878
No. Though it is convenient.

619
00:26:54,986 --> 00:26:57,147
Sookie, you want to tell me what’s going on?

620
00:26:57,317 --> 00:27:01,416
You know, before Kirk changes into his maid’s outfit and starts to clean the room?

621
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,136
A few weeks ago I read in the paper that there was going to be an episode

622
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:07,187
of Dark Shadows on, the one where Barnabas is released from his tomb,

623
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:11,134
and I used to love Dark Shadows, and I just suddenly really wanted to see it.

624
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:11,729
Sure.

625
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:14,672
So, I didn’t get off work in time to get home and see it,

626
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,329
so I just came up here, and it was just supposed to be that one time,

627
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:20,530
but the room was really nice, and I was really comfortable,

628
00:27:20,627 --> 00:27:23,955
and there were Toblerones, and I just had the best time.

629
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:27,411
It was an hour all to myself, and the next week it was another good episode,

630
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:29,645
- and I just kinda...
- Decided to haunt the place.

631
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,265
I tried to clean up afterwards, and the bed was not mussed.

632
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:34,282
Michel is too anal for his own good.

633
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:37,058
- I’m horrible.
- You’re not horrible.

634
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:39,622
I am. I’m the most horrible person in the world.

635
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:42,070
Well, my mother will be sad to know she’s been dethroned.

636
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:45,418
I’m lying to my husband. I’m eating the inn’s candy!

637
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,103
You can’t discuss this with Jackson?

638
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:50,006
Tell him you need one night a week to yourself to watch Dark Shadows?

639
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:52,187
- He wouldn’t understand that?
- Of course he would understand.

640
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:54,686
That’s the problem. Jackson would immediately tell me,

641
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:58,182
Sit down, relax, watch T.V” and he’ll take care of Davey.

642
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,222
Huh. Men are pigs.

643
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,232
And then I would sit there racked with guilt because he works all day too,

644
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,168
and I would think about the fact that I’m shirking my motherly duties,

645
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,778
and it would ruin everything. But here...

646
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:08,613
I get it.

647
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,601
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.

648
00:28:10,696 --> 00:28:13,071
Oh, don’t worry about it. I do think you should tell Jackson, though.

649
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:15,820
He thinks I have you chained to the stove. He’s worried you’re working too hard.

650
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:17,781
I know. I’ll go home right now and tell him.

651
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:18,479
Okay.

652
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:22,549
Of course, it’s the episode where Barnabas kidnaps Maggie.

653
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:26,973
And imprisons her in a coffin in the mausoleum’s secret room in punishment for disobeying him?

654
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,592
Yeah!

655
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,315
Scoot over.

656
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:29,860
- Really?
- Yep.

657
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:31,191
Ah, cool!

658
00:28:32,615 --> 00:28:33,551
Toblerone?

659
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,521
These rooms are nice.

660
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:46,945
Excuse me, I need a ticket!

661
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:48,072
Emily!

662
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,005
Simon! Well, this is a pleasant surprise!

663
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:53,137
Waiting for someone?

664
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:55,610
Yes, a mysterious man with an exotic accent

665
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,693
and a red coat to give me a ticket for my car.

666
00:28:57,775 --> 00:28:59,638
Ah. Well, I wish you a great deal of luck.

667
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:00,749
So, who are you here with?

668
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:01,942
My daughter and her husband.

669
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:03,959
They’re right over there. I’d love for you to meet them.

670
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,669
Diana, come here for a second!

671
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,696
Oh! What on earth?

672
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:11,823
Emily.

673
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:14,368
Richard! Have you lost your mind?

674
00:29:14,496 --> 00:29:15,781
I misjudged the distance.

675
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:18,055
You misjudged the distance! You hit my car!

676
00:29:18,162 --> 00:29:19,924
- I was distracted.
- Emily, are you okay?

677
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:22,434
I’m her husband, Simon. I’ll ask her if she’s okay.

678
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,168
- Are you okay?
- I’m fine.

679
00:29:24,255 --> 00:29:27,210
She’s fine, Simon. Are you happy? Now, go away.

680
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:29,089
- Emily, maybe you should see a doctor.
- No, I...

681
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:32,043
We will determine whether she needs to see a doctor. This is a family matter.

682
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,821
I’ll call you tomorrow and see how you are.

683
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:36,176
She’ll be fine, Simon. She doesn’t need your call.

684
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:38,229
Do you hear me, Simon? Don’t call.

685
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,829
Were you bitten by some kind of rabid animal?

686
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:41,617
Let’s go.

687
00:29:41,838 --> 00:29:45,776
You! You! I’m taking her home. I’ll come back for this car.

688
00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:48,371
- You’re what?
- You were just in a car accident, Emily.

689
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,479
You can’t go to a party after having been in an accident. Let’s go.

690
00:29:51,694 --> 00:29:52,845
What are you doing?

691
00:29:58,806 --> 00:30:00,471
Maybe we should take you to the hospital.

692
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:02,984
I think it’s a toss-up who needs the trip to the hospital more.

693
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:07,110
When you pull up to a valet stand, you get out of the car. You don’t dawdle.

694
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:09,117
I was waiting for someone to take my car!

695
00:30:09,215 --> 00:30:11,580
Well, you wait outside the car! Everybody knows that.

696
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,196
It is not my fault that you ran into my car.

697
00:30:14,283 --> 00:30:15,215
I know you dated him.

698
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:16,286
What?

699
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:19,040
Simon McLane! I know you dated Simon McLane!

700
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:22,640
Richard, I was just in an accident. Now is hardly the time to discuss this.

701
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:23,413
Fine.

702
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:25,814
I found out about it in a business meeting,

703
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,963
which was hardly the time to find out about it, but fine.

704
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,240
- It was dinner.
- Dinner. Of course.

705
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,715
- Nothing happened.
- Of course nothing happened.

706
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:36,075
Stop it, Richard. I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t true.

707
00:30:36,171 --> 00:30:38,967
Well, I told you that nothing happened between me and Pennilyn Lott.

708
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:42,439
That all we did was have lunch. And I wouldn’t have said that if that weren’t true!

709
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:44,486
Well, then, there’s nothing more to be said about these things.

710
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:45,485
I agree.

711
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:49,792
- People are staring, Richard.
- We’re going.

712
00:31:15,512 --> 00:31:18,525
Dessert is it. We wolf it down, we’ve done our duty, we’re out of here.

713
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:19,728
I’m counting the seconds.

714
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:21,346
- Lane.
- Yes, Mama?

715
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:23,343
- I need your help in the kitchen.
- My help?

716
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,560
Food got extra stuck to pots tonight.

717
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,493
Need you to pound the hammer while Aunt Jun holds the chisel. Come.

718
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:32,215
Lane, come now.

719
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:35,282
I’m watching the music, Mama. We’re watching – my boyfriend and I.

720
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,307
Maybe when it’s done.

721
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:38,979
Dirty plates don’t wait for Gayageum.

722
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:40,434
I ask you, you come.

723
00:31:40,557 --> 00:31:43,025
I’m here as a guest, and, by the way, I didn’t hear you ask.

724
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,406
- I heard you demand.
- Lane...

725
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,854
Because you don’t offer. As I taught you to.

726
00:31:46,936 --> 00:31:47,515
Here we go.

727
00:31:47,631 --> 00:31:49,065
- Such insolence!
- Lane...

728
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:50,812
- You don’t get it, Mama.
- Oh, I get it.

729
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,692
You’re modern woman now.

730
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:57,038
Too big to chisel crust off plates. Just standing there, grooving to Gayageum.

731
00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:58,103
- Mama...
- You have values.

732
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:02,091
Values I did not teach you. Spending time with boys – living with boys!

733
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:05,291
Banging drums and playing noise in a rock band with boys!

734
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:05,828
Mama...

735
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:07,764
Paint in your fingernails, gel in your hair.

736
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:10,268
So vain now, you no longer even wear your glasses!

737
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,407
I’ve got contacts! I don’t need them.

738
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:15,044
You’re not you without your glasses.

739
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:16,151
- I agree.
- What?

740
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:16,761
What?

741
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:19,202
It’s just – your glasses. I liked your glasses.

742
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,010
You should wear them. I’m just saying.

743
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:22,463
She should wear them. She should always wear them.

744
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:25,366
I’ve said it before, but it’s true. They made you look smart.

745
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:28,849
Of course they made her look smart. She’s a smart girl. Glasses fit her.

746
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:29,812
- Totally.
- Zach...

747
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:32,545
You always looked good in them. Glasses suit her face.

748
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:34,650
The black frames, especially with her hair...

749
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:38,382
She wore them in the first grade. She first girl in her class.

750
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:39,472
And I bet she looked great.

751
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:41,382
I have pictures in a photo book. I could show you.

752
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:43,149
- I’d love to see them.
- Wait, Zach...

753
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,018
Come. We chisel pots later.

754
00:32:55,607 --> 00:33:00,317
Aw, yeah! Awesome! You guys rock.

755
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:02,364
Do you know Inna Godda Davida?

756
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:14,309
I’ll make arrangements to get your car to the shop tomorrow.

757
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,641
Thank you.

758
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,390
You might want to re-think that lease, though.

759
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,462
Are you sure you’re feeling all right?

760
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:22,937
I’m fine.

761
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:30,069
I don’t want to go back to the pool house.

762
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,920
Come home.

763
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:47,027
- Hey.
- Hey.

764
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:48,225
What are you doing here?

765
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,213
Friday night dinner. Is it not Friday night dinner?

766
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:51,823
No, I mean yes, but I thought you had a thing.

767
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:53,626
Oh, well, it wasn’t a for sure thing.

768
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:54,716
You made it sound for sure.

769
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:56,294
It was a maybe thing, and now it’s a nothing.

770
00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:57,543
Oh, you look disappointed.

771
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,527
I don’t want to talk about it.

772
00:33:58,598 --> 00:33:59,463
Do you want to talk about it?

773
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:00,472
- No.
- Okay.

774
00:34:00,563 --> 00:34:01,766
Not even to tell me who the guy is?

775
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:03,287
He’s no one. Forget it.

776
00:34:03,364 --> 00:34:07,204
Okay. Well, the mystery of the Gilmore dinners continues.

777
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:08,792
- Meaning?
- The pool house is empty.

778
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:10,118
Grandpa forgot about us again?

779
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:13,281
Yes! Apparently all the complexes incurred in my childhood were not enough.

780
00:34:13,364 --> 00:34:14,357
They need to keep a’coming.

781
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:15,366
Did you check on Grandma yet?

782
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:16,409
I’m on my way there now.

783
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,742
Is it Marty?

784
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:19,211
- Forget it, Mom.
- Okay.

785
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:20,394
- But is it?
- No!

786
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:22,643
What are they doing together?

787
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:23,765
Are they arguing?

788
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,825
No – well, I don’t know, they don’t look mad.

789
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:28,064
Oh, great. I’m so not in referee mode tonight.

790
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:28,943
Grandma just laughed.

791
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:31,955
Eh, it could have been an evil laugh. A I’m laughing at your pain” kind of laugh.

792
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,389
Looked like a plain old laugh to me.

793
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:36,654
Oh, Dad’s picking up an ashtray. He’s going to throw it at her! Finally.

794
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:38,938
No! No, he’s just moving it.

795
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:40,992
I don’t get it. What is going on? What are they doing?

796
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:42,276
- I don’t...
- Holy!

797
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:45,436
Ah – oh my God. My parents are having an affair.

798
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:47,187
Oh, careful, it might be a trap.

799
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:48,523
- What?
- I don’t know. I’m freaking out.

800
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:50,734
This does not compute, does not compute.

801
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:53,270
Girls! Wonderful to see you. Come in, come in, come in.

802
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:56,895
- Hi, you’re just in time.
- For what?

803
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,171
The celebration. Ah! Champagne. Perfect.

804
00:35:00,258 --> 00:35:01,323
What are we celebrating?

805
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:02,588
Uh, should we tell them?

806
00:35:02,972 --> 00:35:04,719
They’re going to find out sooner or later.

807
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:06,756
All right, then.

808
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:11,737
Lorelai, Rory, your grandmother and I have reconciled.

809
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,275
We are officially back together.

810
00:35:13,381 --> 00:35:15,837
Really? Oh my God!

811
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:18,374
That’s great! I’m so happy.

812
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,976
When did this reconciliation happen?

813
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:20,877
Yesterday.

814
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:21,870
And last night.

815
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:23,790
- And this morning.
- Richard.

816
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,910
Don’t ask questions. Don’t ask questions. Don’t ask questions!

817
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:28,665
And next week your father and I are going to renew our wedding vows.

818
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:31,056
A week from tomorrow, on our fortieth wedding anniversary.

819
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:32,982
Wow. That’s great!

820
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:34,517
And you’re going to be my maid of honor.

821
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,228
Uh, wha...

822
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,817
Excuse me, Mr. Gilmore. Mr. Jeffries from the Windsor Club for you.

823
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:40,651
Ah, yes. Thank you, Robert.

824
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,519
Oh, by the way, I’m firing Robert next week.

825
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:44,669
You won’t need him.

826
00:35:44,747 --> 00:35:45,520
No, I won’t.

827
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,789
Richard Gilmore here.

828
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,649
The Gold Room?

829
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,541
Ah, yeah, would you hold on for a moment, please?

830
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:55,186
Uh, Emily, they say they can free up the Gold Room.

831
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:57,593
How are we supposed to fit a twenty piece band in the Gold Room?

832
00:35:57,664 --> 00:35:59,630
- No, we need the Rose Room.
- Right.

833
00:36:00,097 --> 00:36:03,414
I’m afraid the Gold Room won’t do. We need the Rose Room.

834
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:05,637
Well, perhaps they’d be willing to switch dates.

835
00:36:05,712 --> 00:36:07,648
We’d certainly be happy to make it worth their while.

836
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:09,190
Of course, I’ll hold.

837
00:36:09,655 --> 00:36:11,795
Richard, we just have to get the Rose Room.

838
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:14,407
Don’t you worry, our company insures that building.

839
00:36:14,662 --> 00:36:15,804
We don’t get that room,

840
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:20,085
suddenly they have a very expensive foundation upgrade to go through.

841
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,742
I married a wonderful man, girls.

842
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:23,771
Yes, you did.

843
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:26,766
Hey, Mom, about this whole, um, maid of honor thing?

844
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:29,727
Oh, yes. Richard, can you spare us a moment? I want to take Lorelai upstairs.

845
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:30,884
- Why?
- Of course.

846
00:36:31,134 --> 00:36:32,599
Wha- why do you want to take me upstairs?

847
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,633
Wonderful, we’ll be right back.

848
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,298
Why doesn’t Rory have to go upstairs?

849
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,650
I’ll finish this phone call and then Rory and I will discuss

850
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:39,710
the possibility of her being my best man.

851
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,824
Really? I’m going to be your best man?

852
00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:42,992
What’s upstairs?

853
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,709
Ah, Emily. Wonderful timing.

854
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,346
Please start with the Oscar de la Renta.

855
00:36:52,556 --> 00:36:57,578
Susan Hayworth never wore anything but de la Renta in her final days.

856
00:36:57,974 --> 00:37:00,518
Clark Gable never knew what he was missing.

857
00:37:01,294 --> 00:37:06,843
He was a cad, but the crease in his pants was immaculate.

858
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,810
Oh, my God! It’s Natalie Wood.

859
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:12,924
Hello, Miss Celine. You look wonderful.

860
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:16,263
Olive oil on the inside and on the outside.

861
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:18,576
Anna Manana taught me that.

862
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:20,491
I think this has too much lace, Celine.

863
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:23,860
Ah, there can’t be too much lace, as long as it’s Italian.

864
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,678
What do you think, Natalie?

865
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:27,224
- What do you think?
- Whatever you want, Mom.

866
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:29,907
Lorelai! You’re my maid of honor. I need your opinion here.

867
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:33,261
Well, I kind of like that one, or even the one next to it.

868
00:37:33,594 --> 00:37:35,663
- I’ll try them both.
- You’ll try them all.

869
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:40,367
I had the worst row with Dietrich once.

870
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:44,750
I told her, Marlene, until you actually become a man

871
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:47,494
you must try dresses on like a woman.

872
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:49,937
And that means all of them.

873
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:52,118
Are you married, Natalie?

874
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:53,669
Oh, no, not yet.

875
00:37:53,884 --> 00:37:57,653
Actually, Celine, she just opened her own business. She owns an inn now.

876
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:00,520
Hmm, an inn, how charming.

877
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:06,033
Emily, do you need breasts or are yours sufficing for the moment?

878
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:07,811
I’m fine for the moment, Celine.

879
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:11,690
Oh, my God, you’re Mary Martin. Take it off immediately.

880
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,435
Oh, dear.

881
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:13,309
Here, try this one on, Mom.

882
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:18,495
You know, I’m trying to decide whether to go with a hat

883
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,681
or some sort of headpiece, or whether that’s too much.

884
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:26,094
When I was dressing Marilyn for her wedding to Arthur Miller,

885
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:33,488
I told her, I said, Marilyn! Wear a flat hat on your head. It will remind him of a book. ”

886
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,574
She didn’t, and we all saw how that turned out.

887
00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:38,909
You wear whatever you want, Mom.

888
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:41,137
Celine, I’m going to need some help with this zipper.

889
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:43,929
Oh, very elegant.

890
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:46,315
Very nice, oh.

891
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:51,388
There you go, Mrs. Oscar Lavant, love that.

892
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:57,271
Here, try the Dior just for giggles, hmm?

893
00:38:57,372 --> 00:38:58,038
All right.

894
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:04,786
I will never, under any circumstances, no matter how short a dress you put on,

895
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,749
go back to Al’s Pancake World ever, ever again.

896
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,342
Aw, you didn’t like your manicotti?

897
00:39:10,444 --> 00:39:15,441
That was not manicotti, it was square and flat and blue.

898
00:39:15,555 --> 00:39:17,284
Yeah. Manicotti’s rarely blue.

899
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:26,260
You know, I’ve been thinking, uh, maybe I shouldn’t go to this thing of your parents’.

900
00:39:26,817 --> 00:39:29,506
First Al’s Pancake World, and now my parents vow renewal?

901
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:30,392
I’m serious.

902
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:33,418
I’m not really their favorite person. They don’t really want me there.

903
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,936
Hey, I’m not their favorite person either, and I still have to go.

904
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:37,232
I know, it’s just...

905
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:41,770
It’s going to be this big fancy thing with all their friends. And, you know, I just...

906
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:44,617
Listen. My parents are very weird people.

907
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:46,780
They don’t hate you. They just don’t know you.

908
00:39:46,848 --> 00:39:50,340
This is the perfect opportunity. They’ll be happy. They’ll be smashed.

909
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,785
You show up, shake some hands, get in a few family pictures,

910
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,856
and before you know it my mother will be trying to convince you you’re too good for me.

911
00:39:57,513 --> 00:40:01,292
Come on, it’ll be fun. Good food. Open bar.

912
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:04,436
I’m wearing a fabulous dress and as maid of honor,

913
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,316
if you’re not there, I’ll have to get drunk and make out with the best man.

914
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:12,078
Who is Rory. So you can see all the creepy ramifications of your absence here.

915
00:40:12,397 --> 00:40:14,311
- Okay.
- Okay?

916
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,566
Okay.

917
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:17,810
Hey!

918
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:21,695
You got a T.V.!

919
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:23,308
Oh. Yeah.

920
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:25,106
Since when did you get a T.V.?

921
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:27,056
I just picked it up this morning.

922
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,474
What about your REM sleep?

923
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:31,680
Hey, twice a week you’re going to bed at 9:30 like a 72-year-old woman

924
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,223
because I have early deliveries, so I figured the least I could do

925
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:36,896
is make sure you don’t miss your Charlie Rose or your Patrick Stewart...

926
00:40:36,957 --> 00:40:37,577
Jon Stewart.

927
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:39,723
And plus, I can sleep through anything. Once I’m out, I’m out.

928
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:40,496
Oh, I know.

929
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,778
So, here.

930
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:44,054
Enjoy.

931
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,653
You are too good for me.

932
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:55,994
Well, maybe I’ll meet a nice girl at your parent’s wedding.

933
00:41:13,716 --> 00:41:15,978
Emily. Wow, this is a surprise.

934
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:18,175
- May I come in?
- Yes, please come in.

935
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:18,736
I didn’t even know you knew where I lived.

936
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:22,178
I know all kinds of things.

937
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,493
Obviously you have a maid.

938
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:25,275
Yes, I have a maid-nanny combo.

939
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:27,214
Ah. How McDonald’s of you.

940
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:30,405
Uh, can I get you something? A tea, or coffee, or...

941
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:31,599
I’m fine, thank you.

942
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:33,381
So, this is the child.

943
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,710
Yes, this is Georgia. We call her Gigi.

944
00:41:35,895 --> 00:41:37,107
And her mother’s still gone?

945
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:38,709
Yes. She’s in Paris.

946
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:40,835
All right. I’ll come straight to the point, Christopher.

947
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:44,291
Now, I have known you a long time. I watched you grow up.

948
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:47,599
You were a charming boy. A weak, but charming boy.

949
00:41:47,764 --> 00:41:50,937
And to be completely honest, I never thought much of you. I still don’t.

950
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:52,953
Wow. That’s great of you to come by and share that with me.

951
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:54,443
However, you have good breeding.

952
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:57,250
You come from an impeccable family and you love Lorelai.

953
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:58,617
You’ve always loved Lorelai.

954
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,962
You would’ve married her when she got pregnant. I know that.

955
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:05,211
And you would have married her if that girlfriend of yours hadn’t gotten pregnant with this.

956
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:06,379
I know that too.

957
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,985
Lorelai’s in a relationship now, did you know that?

958
00:42:09,064 --> 00:42:09,821
Yes, I know that.

959
00:42:09,913 --> 00:42:11,878
He owns a diner. He’s a divorcee.

960
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,221
He’s uneducated, he’s not a proper stepfather for Rory

961
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:17,704
and he’s completely unsuitable for Lorelai.

962
00:42:17,895 --> 00:42:20,915
My daughter is stubborn, but she’s capable of greatness.

963
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:25,396
And watching her settle down with a man who could hold her back from that is unacceptable.

964
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,278
You, at least, won’t hold her back.

965
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:30,494
Okay, Emily, I’m very confused by this speech of yours,

966
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:32,286
and Gigi needs to be fed.

967
00:42:32,413 --> 00:42:35,332
She’s getting serious with this man. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.

968
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:38,093
If you want a chance with Lorelai you had better do something.

969
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:39,890
And you had better do something now.

970
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:42,896
Timing has never been your strong point, Christopher.

971
00:42:43,002 --> 00:42:44,610
You should see if you can change that.

972
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,584
Goodbye, Gigi. Enjoy your program.
