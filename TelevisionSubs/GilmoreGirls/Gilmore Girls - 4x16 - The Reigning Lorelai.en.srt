1
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:04,620
Don't tell me this is what it looks like.

2
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:05,880
It's escargot.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,590
That's what it looks like.

4
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:08,362
Snails?

5
00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:09,479
Escargot.

6
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:11,068
Slimy thing by any other name...

7
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:12,807
They taste like garlic and butter.

8
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:13,585
Don't say "they."

9
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,680
- Food should not have pronouns. 
- Give it a try.

10
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:18,419
But if I do and we're having road kill for the main course,

11
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:19,894
then I will already have used up my allotment

12
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,352
of gross-out food for the day, so I'll abstain.

13
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:23,846
I guess we should strike escargot

14
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:25,792
off the list of Friday night dinner foods.

15
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,241
Sweetie loved escargot.

16
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:29,574
That's funny how we remember those things.

17
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:32,038
- Sweetie? 
- Sweetie who?

18
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,157
Sweetie Nelson, one of my oldest friends.

19
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,345
She passed away yesterday.

20
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:36,590
Oh, I'm sorry, Grandma.

21
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:38,135
Yeah, I've heard you mention her.

22
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:38,965
Was she sick?

23
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:40,833
She'd been ill for some time, but still...

24
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:42,133
The family is pretty overwhelmed.

25
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:43,779
By the way, Davis called late today.

26
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:44,997
The funeral is going to be Sunday.

27
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,430
Was that her real name -- Sweetie?

28
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:48,581
No, her name was Melinda. Sweetie was a nickname.

29
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:49,365
Why?

30
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:50,464
What do you mean, why?

31
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,656
I mean, how did they get Sweetie from Melinda?

32
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,109
They didn't get Sweetie from Melinda. Sweetie is a nickname.

33
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:57,598
Yes, I know Sweetie was a nickname,

34
00:00:57,694 --> 00:01:00,576
but usually, a nickname comes from a version of your name,

35
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,379
or there's a story behind the name or something.

36
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,621
She was sweet. That's the story.

37
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:07,545
She had a very sweet nature.

38
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,104
Well, what kind of story did you want, Lorelai?

39
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:12,798
No, that's fine. She was sweet.

40
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,519
They called her Sweetie. It's a good story.

41
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:16,573
No, really. Exactly what kind of story

42
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:18,709
about my recently departed friend would amuse you?

43
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,129
- Mom, it's not to amuse me. It's... 
- All right, fine.

44
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,150
Sweetie's father was a very poor man,

45
00:01:24,288 --> 00:01:28,440
so poor that Sweetie and her four siblings all had to sleep in a hollowed-out tree trunk

46
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:30,509
because the house was only big enough for their parents.

47
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,205
One winter, there was no food, so Sweetie crawled out of her trunk,

48
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:35,609
wrapped her feet in newspaper,

49
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,142
and walked forty miles in the snow to the nearest town,

50
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:40,334
where she stumbled into a candy store.

51
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,247
The owner took pity on her and gave her bags of candy,

52
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,562
a dill pickle, and drove her back to her family.

53
00:01:45,776 --> 00:01:47,799
He promptly offered a job to her father,

54
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,015
who gladly accepted and eventually owned that store

55
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:54,270
and turned it into one of the most important candy emporiums in the world.

56
00:01:54,522 --> 00:01:56,648
And that is how she got the name Sweetie.

57
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,060
There, how was that?

58
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,365
Now, that was a pretty good story.

59
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,819
I'm sorry, Emily, did you say the funeral is Sunday?

60
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,073
Yes. Is that a problem?

61
00:02:03,237 --> 00:02:04,362
Well, Mr. Hamoto is in town,

62
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:07,317
and Jason has set up golf for him, and then there's lunch after that.

63
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:10,640
- What time is the service? 
- Noon.

64
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,841
Oh, noon. That's cutting it very close.

65
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,484
How important is it for me to be at the funeral?

66
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:18,443
- Not important at all. 
- Well, fine, then.

67
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:19,953
Be sure to give them my condolences.

68
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,160
Of course. Eat your food.

69
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,382
I think one of them is still alive.

70
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:25,852
- Lorelai! 
- No, seriously.

71
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:27,854
He was over near the radish like five minutes ago.

72
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:26,770
- This doesn't smell right. 
- Smells fine, Kirk.

73
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:29,166
- I think the eggs were bad. 
- The eggs are fine, Kirk.

74
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:30,523
Were they cooked in the fish pan?

75
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,095
They smell like they were cooked in the fish pan.

76
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:33,702
No, the eggs were not cooked in the fish pan.

77
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:34,680
They were cooked in the egg pan.

78
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,517
Was the fish pan sitting next to the egg pan? Because perhaps...

79
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,634
I need something with cheese!

80
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,933
Lorelai, smell my eggs.

81
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:41,751
Not today, Kirk. Hey, where's Luke?

82
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:44,726
I want him to make that breakfast quesadilla thing he made yesterday.

83
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:45,509
Luke's not here.

84
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:46,620
Where is he?

85
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,760
He knows the exact right jack-to-cheddar ratio.

86
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:49,943
- He's out there. 
- Where?

87
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,985
- Over there with Nicole. 
- Oh, looks like a serious talk.

88
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,772
And there have been zero light moments.

89
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:56,697
I wish I knew what they were talking about.

90
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,155
Oh, I can tell you what they're saying.

91
00:03:58,315 --> 00:03:58,662
How?

92
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:01,499
I read lips. My girlfriend taught me.

93
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,674
It's so we can have quiet time and keep the conversation going at the same time.

94
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:09,692
Okay, she just said, "Hardwood sponge is the authority of the hostile biographer."

95
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:13,203
And then he responded, "Just phone cords to original samovars."

96
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:14,776
Kirk, that doesn't make any sense.

97
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,315
Must mean they're on to us and they've switched to some sort of code.

98
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:18,877
I don't think they're speaking in code.

99
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:20,818
Oh, I think Luke's heading back.

100
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:22,487
He just got up and said, "Feel your taters."

101
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:24,888
Is it possible he said, "I'll see you later?"

102
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,720
No, I'm pretty sure about this one.

103
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:29,255
Kirk, I'm so sorry, we accidentally made the eggs in the fish pan.

104
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,089
Here's new eggs.

105
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:32,507
I don't know why everybody in this town always thinks I'm crazy.

106
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:35,767
You've got to be kidding.

107
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,939
I certainly am not kidding. This is serious.

108
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:39,823
- It's not plagiarism. 
- Hey!

109
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,882
Do you also like to shout "fire" in a crowded theater?

110
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:46,084
This is a newsroom. Do not use the "p" word.

111
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:48,040
Every single word in my piece was written by me.

112
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:48,696
Was it?

113
00:04:48,993 --> 00:04:51,307
Look at this. "Small band of followers."

114
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:52,700
"Rain-soaked highway."

115
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:54,507
I've seen both of those before.

116
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:55,684
Of course you've seen them before.

117
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,079
Those are phrases used to talk about a small band of followers or,

118
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:00,647
you know, a rain-soaked highway.

119
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:03,472
They're not even clichés like "shouting fire in a crowded theater."

120
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:05,177
I'm sorry, can you say "Stephen Glass?"

121
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:09,187
The entire climate of journalistic ethics is under a microscope right now.

122
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:10,973
We can't afford anything that looks shady.

123
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:13,655
I'd rather not have Tobey Maguire playing me in a movie

124
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,541
about the Yale Daily News scandal, thank you very much.

125
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:18,546
I get that, but I don't think my "rain-soaked highway" looks shady.

126
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,636
Typical.

127
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,577
- It's your attitude. 
- What attitude?

128
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,051
Look around this room.

129
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,643
People writing their anthro papers on our computers,

130
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:27,731
people Xeroxing their phone bills on our copy machines.

131
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:29,753
No one's running, no one's sweating.

132
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:32,196
Every single person in this room looks extremely well-rested.

133
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:34,234
No one spell-checks. No one fact-checks.

134
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:36,733
This is the breeding ground for the next Jayson Blair!

135
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:39,384
Fix it. And tidy up your desk!

136
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:41,796
- And my month is up. 
- What?

137
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,286
You're the new dog to kick around here.

138
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:45,175
I feel bad, 'cause you tend to be a pretty decent person,

139
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:47,894
but my nose has been whacked with a newspaper so many times this month,

140
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:49,093
it almost makes me miss my mother.

141
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:50,582
Doyle's just in a bad mood, that's all.

142
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:53,249
"Herd mentality?" Are you freaking kidding me?!

143
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:55,927
Welcome to the dollhouse.

144
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,138
Michel, come on, we've got to get into these budgets.

145
00:05:59,281 --> 00:05:59,834
Now.

146
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:02,021
Does the red light mean it's programmed?

147
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,613
I explained it a hundred times.

148
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:06,019
Michel, you've been setting that machine for 20 minutes now.

149
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:07,770
The man can't live without his dog show.

150
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,402
I could just kill my cable provider.

151
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:12,746
"No Westminster dog show, but please enjoy

152
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:15,531
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle 24 hours a day."

153
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,316
- Ah, there, it's recording. 
- Well, get over here.

154
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:20,611
I just want to see the Chows.

155
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:24,333
Look at that one strut.

156
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,776
You know you're a pretty girl, don't you?

157
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,961
Yes, with those "I need some loving" eyes.

158
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:31,091
Is he doing tricks?

159
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,423
It sounds like they're turning them.

160
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,835
- Hello. 
- Lorelai, it's me.

161
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,719
- Do you have a moment? 
- Sure.

162
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:38,547
Your grandmother. She's gone.

163
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:39,852
- What? 
- Last night.

164
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:42,377
She apparently had a heart attack. The maid found her in the morning.

165
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:44,553
But I didn't even know her heart was a thing.

166
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:46,395
Was her heart a thing? Did we know that?

167
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:49,544
No, it was quite unexpected. There wasn't any warning at all.

168
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,552
But we just saw her.

169
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,935
I know. It's a complete shock.

170
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,576
Ohh. I... How is Dad?

171
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,235
He's completely fallen apart.

172
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,759
From the moment he heard the news, he's been almost incoherent.

173
00:06:59,883 --> 00:07:00,782
Oh, no.

174
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,816
He's in his office now with the Scotch,

175
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:05,611
and he wants turtleneck soup -- asks for it over and over.

176
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:07,175
What's turtleneck soup?

177
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:09,778
Apparently something his mother used to have made for him

178
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,843
when he was a little boy, and now he wants some,

179
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:15,140
and I can't seem to find anybody who has any idea what it is.

180
00:07:15,258 --> 00:07:17,914
All right, the pugs are up next. They're ugly. Let's do this.

181
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:21,108
- My grandmother. 
- Heart attack -- grandmother.

182
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:21,704
What?

183
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,500
Dead grandmother, Michel.

184
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,543
Mom, have you looked on the internet?

185
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:26,855
- For what? 
- For turtleneck soup.

186
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:29,204
- You could Google it. 
- Can I? Can I Google it?

187
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:30,351
Okay, never mind.

188
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,297
Sookie, do you have any idea what turtleneck soup could be?

189
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,495
You mean mock turtle soup?

190
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,092
Mom, do you think he means "mock turtle soup?"

191
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:36,367
Maybe that's what he said.

192
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,164
- Is there such a thing? 
- I think so.

193
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:39,255
Can you make mock turtle soup?

194
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,219
I never tried, but I think I have a recipe for it somewhere here.

195
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:45,441
So, Mom, Sookie's tracking down the soup. What else can I do?

196
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,555
Nothing. If you can find the soup, that'll be enough.

197
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,458
- You'll tell Rory? 
- Yeah, I'll tell Rory.

198
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:50,693
All right, I have to go.

199
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:53,166
Your grandmother left very specific instructions

200
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:55,383
on exactly how she wants her funeral to be,

201
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:56,894
so I have a hundred things to do.

202
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:58,583
I'll be there with the soup as soon as I can, Mom.

203
00:07:58,695 --> 00:07:59,904
- All right, bye. 
- Bye.

204
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:02,014
I'm gonna have to go.

205
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,933
No problem. One huge vat of mock turtle soup coming up.

206
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:06,627
Do you need a hug?

207
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,070
Thanks, I'm okay. I have to call Rory.

208
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:10,902
- You'll call me when the soup's ready? 
- I'm on it.

209
00:08:11,886 --> 00:08:12,884
Have to go.

210
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,166
Michel, you'll take care of the papers and the landscaping plans?

211
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,343
Yes, I will. Go, go.

212
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:20,129
Okay. Purse, coat, keys. I'm gone.

213
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,527
- Michel? 
- Yes?

214
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:23,641
I think I'll take that hug now.

215
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:31,573
- A little weird, huh? 
- Yeah, extremely.

216
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:33,215
Heart in the right place, but never again?

217
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:33,987
Thank God.

218
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:37,604
Yes, I understand the reverend's retired. You said that four times.

219
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:40,937
But my mother-in-law specifically requested him for the service, and

220
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:44,715
Well, isn't there any forwarding information?

221
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,543
I got the soup.

222
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,689
Well, I will hold while you look.

223
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,798
Thank God. He's in his study.

224
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,524
Take that into him and see if you can get him to eat.

225
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,232
Yes, I'm still here. Miraculous, isn't it?

226
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:56,849
A phone number! How

227
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:00,822
Hey, dad.

228
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,237
Lorelai?

229
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,946
Yeah, I have something for you.

230
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:08,175
Mock turtle soup.

231
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:09,847
Mock turtle soup?

232
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:11,436
Yeah. Sookie made it.

233
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:12,559
Mock turtle soup.

234
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:14,524
Mock turtle soup.

235
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:16,726
Mock turtle soup.

236
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,055
Mock turtle soup.

237
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:21,938
Oh, hey, soup's gone. No soup here.

238
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:24,002
Who mentioned soup? This is definitely a no-soup zone.

239
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:30,656
The music's nice.

240
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:32,511
Oh, she loved Kay Kyser.

241
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:36,305
She wasn't really a musical woman.

242
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,276
Music was a little frivolous for her.

243
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:42,906
- But Kay Kyser. 
- Yeah. Well, she's great.

244
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,799
Kay Kyser's a man.

245
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:47,737
Oh, well, his parents had an ugly sense of humor then.

246
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,305
Oh, boy.

247
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:56,160
She was a saint -- the woman was a saint.

248
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:57,332
Here, Dad.

249
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:59,415
I learned everything from that woman.

250
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,137
"Life is a battle,

251
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,569
and you either enter it armed

252
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:05,689
or you surrender immediately."

253
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:07,589
That is what she told me...

254
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:09,846
on my 10th birthday. I never forgot that.

255
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,211
No, no one...

256
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:15,497
was as strong as that woman.

257
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:18,207
That wonderful woman...

258
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,556
that saint of a woman.

259
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:23,715
Oh, Dad.

260
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,126
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

261
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:30,756
I just have to deal with this...

262
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:34,775
- regret. 
- What regret?

263
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,518
Dad, you and Gran were so close.

264
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,107
The last words we exchanged, we exchanged in anger.

265
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:40,556
Oh, but, dad, that's...

266
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:42,408
I lost my temper

267
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,759
and I was disrespectful.

268
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:48,743
And that's the way -- that's the way it ended.

269
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:50,924
With an argument

270
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:53,504
and hateful words.

271
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,367
Dad, you know, that was one little fight.

272
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,376
I mean, one little fight between you and Gran doesn't wipe away years of...

273
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:03,202
That woman raised me and she taught me.

274
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:07,001
And she took care of the family even after Father died.

275
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:11,440
And I spoke her as if I owed her nothing,

276
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:14,062
as if she was like anyone else in the world

277
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,920
and not the saint of a woman that she was.

278
00:11:16,012 --> 00:11:17,011
Oh, Dad.

279
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:19,381
You only have one set of parents, Lorelai.

280
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:23,550
Remember that. I forgot and now I have to live with that for the rest of my life.

281
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,651
You mentioned soup.

282
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,117
- What? 
- When you came in.

283
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:43,159
Yes, soup. I have soup.

284
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:47,950
Mom mentioned that you were talking about mock turtle soup

285
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:49,947
and you really should eat something, Dad.

286
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:51,351
I need a spoon.

287
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:53,214
Oh, my Go-- yes, I'll get you a spoon.

288
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:56,108
I'll get you -- you just sit right there.

289
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:57,761
I'll be right back with your spoon.

290
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,408
But it used to be Martelli's Florist, yes?

291
00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:03,618
Okay, do you have any idea where Martelli's moved to?

292
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,397
Oh, well, before he died, did Mr. Martelli pass his trade

293
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:08,898
on to any of the other Martellis?

294
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:10,597
Yes, I'll hold.

295
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:12,103
- How is he doing? 
- He needs a spoon.

296
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,309
- He's going to eat? 
- He's going to eat.

297
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,475
Thank God. Take an apple.

298
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:17,796
See if you can get him to eat an apple.

299
00:12:18,344 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm here.

300
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,855
Yes, I will take the simple stepson's number.

301
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:23,422
Thank you.

302
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:25,804
I will speak slowly. Thank you.

303
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:27,529
Not that one.

304
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,038
And take some bread, too.

305
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:32,910
How are the arrangements coming?

306
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:34,165
Well, she made them twenty years ago,

307
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:36,192
so the reverend is retired, the florist has moved,

308
00:12:36,268 --> 00:12:38,235
and two of the pallbearers are no longer with us.

309
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:41,005
Luckily, they both had sons who look remarkably like them,

310
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,228
so I think we can get away with it.

311
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:44,072
All right, I'm gonna bring this stuff to Dad.

312
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,084
I'm going to call the florist's idiot stepson.

313
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,138
Emily? Emily!

314
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:49,811
I'm right here, Richard. What's wrong?

315
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:52,637
This is outrageous! They've completely ruined it!

316
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,662
Who ruined what?

317
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:56,610
Trix's obituary. The Courant just faxed it through.

318
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:58,629
It's disgraceful! I'll sue them!

319
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,831
Just calm down.

320
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,379
"Lorelai Gilmore died this week at age 86.

321
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:05,479
A member of the prominent Gilmore family

322
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,112
and widow of Charles Abbott Gilmore,

323
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,400
she is survived by a son, Richard Gilmore,

324
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,187
and numerous other family members and devoted friends."

325
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:15,555
- Well, it's...
- It's an insult!

326
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:17,444
That's all they write?

327
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:20,997
Nothing about her charity work or her collecting or her travels?

328
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:25,529
And not a word about the new maternity wing that she donated to St. Joseph's!

329
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:28,171
You tell me where all of the fine people of Hartford

330
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:31,816
are supposed to have all their babies if it weren't for my mother, tell me that!

331
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:34,310
All right, all right, calm down. We will take care of it.

332
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,395
She was a saint, that woman!

333
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:38,785
I know. Absolutely, we will make sure it says "saint" somewhere in the article.

334
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:39,896
- You're sure? 
- I'm sure.

335
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:40,694
Don't worry, Dad.

336
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,220
Because it's very, very wrong!

337
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,407
- Dad, I got your spoon. 
- Well, I'm not hungry.

338
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:48,697
Wonderful. Yet another thing I have to take care of.

339
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,201
Mom, why don't you let me help out a little?

340
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,302
- That's all right. 
- I'm happy to do it.

341
00:13:52,384 --> 00:13:55,046
I'll bring coffee, a Danish. You've never had so much fun with death in your life.

342
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:57,304
I appreciate the offer, but I have it all under control.

343
00:13:57,442 --> 00:13:58,670
I should probably take off then.

344
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:00,530
Goodbye. Thank Sookie for me.

345
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:06,622
Hello, I'm looking for Manny Martelli, please.

346
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:11,092
Well, what time do you expect him back from the science-fiction convention?

347
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:12,673
Yes.

348
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:14,922
Would you hold on a minute, please?

349
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,849
Lorelai, I have to go to Gran's house tomorrow to sort through her personal papers.

350
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:20,533
Two cherry Danish coming up.

351
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,503
Yes, I would like to leave a message.

352
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:32,019
- Hello? 
- Hey, it's me.

353
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,818
Nigella just made a raisin cake that looked so good,

354
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:37,497
the fact that raisins make me gag became totally irrelevant.

355
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:39,510
Well, good, more ordering choices.

356
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:42,443
Oh, my God, she's about to deep-fry a Bounty Bar.

357
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,496
I want to move in with her and call her Mommy. Do you mind?

358
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:46,692
Honey, I have to tell you something.

359
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:47,450
You sound sad.

360
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,005
Yeah, well, Gran died.

361
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,225
What? When?

362
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:53,052
Last night. She had a heart attack.

363
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,714
Are you okay?

364
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:58,141
- How's Grandpa? 
- Well, he's been better.

365
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,723
What should I do? Can I do something?

366
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,505
No, it's all being taken care of.

367
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:02,396
When's the funeral?

368
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,580
Friday, and there's a wake after. I don't remember if you have a class.

369
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,270
Doesn't matter. I'll make it work.

370
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:07,936
Okay.

371
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,575
I was just getting to know her.

372
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:11,982
I think you got a pretty good snapshot.

373
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,050
Shouldn't I be crying? I feel like I should be crying.

374
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,755
You didn't know her that well.

375
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,131
Still, she was my great-grandmother.

376
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,123
I mean, I should feel more.

377
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:20,817
Oh, God, what if I don't cry at the funeral?

378
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:24,019
Then everyone will see that I'm not crying, and Grandpa will be upset.

379
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,417
Well, honey, if you can't cry,

380
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:29,082
at least you know you can work yourself up into a very respectable panic attack.

381
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:30,413
It might have to do.

382
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:31,612
You're an amazing kid.

383
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:34,500
She was so lucky to have you as a great-granddaughter.

384
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:39,317
Hey, do you want me to come by tonight, pick you up,

385
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:41,821
take you to Tijuana, get you drunk and laid?

386
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:43,608
That's okay. I've got too much work to do.

387
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:44,351
Okay,

388
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:47,627
well, call me if you want to talk or whatever.

389
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:48,559
I will.

390
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:50,585
- I love you, hon. 
- I love you, too, Mom.

391
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:56,388
This looks like -- what a shock --

392
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,016
another incoherent legal document.

393
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,823
Hand it to me.

394
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,474
House insurance policy."

395
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:04,385
Hand it to me.

396
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:07,227
You know, Mom, seriously, I can do more than just hand you stuff.

397
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:08,726
That's all right. I have a system.

398
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:10,872
Yes. You don't think I can work within the system,

399
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:13,580
but I can! I have no plans to overthrow the system.

400
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,285
Just teach me the system. Teach it!

401
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:16,545
Just hand me some papers.

402
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,184
Emily, excuse me.

403
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:21,461
We finished cataloging the second floor, and we're about to move to the third.

404
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:22,480
That's fine, Georgia.

405
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,235
And we have bubble-wrapped those bar glasses.

406
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:25,243
Where do you want us to put them?

407
00:16:25,337 --> 00:16:27,314
In the trunk of my car, along with the candlesticks.

408
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,987
- My keys are in the foyer. 
- All right.

409
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:32,039
- What was that about? 
- I'm preparing for the funeral.

410
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:34,644
Stashing bar glasses is preparing for the funeral?

411
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:36,800
Those bar glasses are supposed to stay in the family.

412
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:38,111
They go to us, then to you.

413
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:41,484
However, every time a certain relative of your father's comes to visit,

414
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:42,816
things tend to disappear.

415
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,311
Dad's got a Winona in the family? How cool. Who is it?

416
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:46,508
His cousin Marilyn.

417
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,430
She has been systematically pilfering those bar glasses for the last five years.

418
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:51,111
Really.

419
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,630
Plus, I saw her eyeing the candlesticks last Easter,

420
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,120
and I'll be damned if I let her get them.

421
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:56,999
So much to do.

422
00:16:57,361 --> 00:17:00,276
Did I tell you about the burial-slash-cremation clause?

423
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,505
Now you're just making stuff up.

424
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:03,778
Your grandmother is to have an open-casket ceremony,

425
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:05,201
displayed in all her glory,

426
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:08,873
then is to be cremated and have her ashes divided in two --

427
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,278
half to be buried with her husband in the family crypt,

428
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:14,294
and the other half to be put in an urn and placed on our mantelpiece.

429
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:16,481
Half of Gran is going to be on your mantel forever.

430
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:19,276
Staring at me, judging me, disapproving of me.

431
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:20,434
So apparently, it's the top half.

432
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,563
When I first found out, I almost had a coronary, but I've accepted it.

433
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,701
From now on, it's going to be a 3-person household --

434
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,115
your father, me, and her urn.

435
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,532
You know, it's so weird. I know so little about Gran.

436
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,462
I mean, like, what was her maiden name?

437
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:32,179
Gilmore.

438
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:33,925
- No, no, her maiden name. 
- Gilmore.

439
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:36,279
Wait. You're not saying...

440
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:37,534
She and Charles were second cousins.

441
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:38,701
Ew! What?!

442
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:40,473
Oh, don't act so scandalized.

443
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:44,170
It was not at all uncommon for prominent families to keep the bloodlines closed.

444
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:45,839
Keeping the bloodlines closed.

445
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,729
- Is that what we're calling it? 
- Well, what would you call it?

446
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:49,863
Oh, I don't know. How about "Good morning, Appalachia,

447
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,885
I got a mighty cute sister and an extra set of toes."

448
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,405
No one has any extra toes.

449
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,687
I have a double-jointed thumb.

450
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:57,048
Remarkable. Use it to hand me some more papers, please.

451
00:17:57,854 --> 00:18:01,533
I'm sorry, but I don't understand how everyone was so okay with this.

452
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:02,971
I mean, what, did they just go,

453
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:04,942
"What a cute couple. They look so much alike."

454
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,486
Mom?

455
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:09,006
This is to your father.

456
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:12,494
It's a carbon copy of a letter she sent to your father.

457
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:14,378
That's nice.

458
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:16,385
My Dearest Richard, It is with heavy heart

459
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:17,981
that I write you this letter tonight,

460
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:21,091
but I cannot stand by and let you make a terrible mistake.

461
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:22,955
Until now, I had thought, hoped, prayed

462
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,535
that you would come to the same conclusion that I have.

463
00:18:25,878 --> 00:18:29,006
But you have not, and therefore, I feel it is my duty as your mother

464
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:32,119
to beg you to reconsider your impending marriage.

465
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,313
I'm sure that Emily is a very suitable woman for someone,

466
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:37,873
but not for you.

467
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:39,850
She will not be able to make you happy.

468
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,010
She does not have the Gilmore stamina or spark.

469
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,877
She is simply not a Gilmore.

470
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:46,860
Well, sure, 'cause you weren't directly related to him.

471
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:50,122
I don't know the circumstances surrounding your breakup with Pennilyn Lott,

472
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:54,955
but it is still my belief that she is much better suited for you than Emily.

473
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:58,042
I know that the timing of this is particularly awkward,

474
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:00,141
since you are to be married tomorrow.

475
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:01,323
No way!

476
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:03,126
But your happiness is too important to me,

477
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:04,570
so timing be damned.

478
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,083
She wanted Dad to leave you at the altar.

479
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,367
She begged him to leave me at the altar!

480
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:12,092
She begged him in writing, and then she saved the carbons!

481
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:13,474
Holy moly. Can I see that?

482
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,179
I can't believe this.

483
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,973
I'm standing here in her basement, covered in dust.

484
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:22,418
I'm organizing her estate and cataloging her things.

485
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:24,099
I've been on the phone for days,

486
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:27,032
trying to make sure that everything was exactly the way she wanted it,

487
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,503
and all this time, she never even wanted me in her family!

488
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:32,663
Man, she sure used a lot of exclamation points.

489
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,626
Well, fine.

490
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:36,109
That's just fine, because I am done.

491
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:37,630
Done?

492
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:40,047
I'm done planning and running around and calling people.

493
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,716
I'm done with anything having to do with that woman.

494
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:42,448
But Dad

495
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:45,141
Skipped my best friend's funeral to golf -- that's what your dad did!

496
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,463
Mom, we have to plan this funeral.

497
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:48,044
Find a box, throw her in, we're done!

498
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:48,659
Mom.

499
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:51,347
Better yet, throw the old harpy's carcass in a ditch!

500
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:52,591
Let a wolverine eat her.

501
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,779
Okay, but, see, finding a wolverine near a ditch -- that takes planning.

502
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,898
Do whatever you want! I'm going to have a drink. Would you like a drink?

503
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:01,469
I can't do it, Mom! I don't know the system!

504
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:05,028
- Bank info? 
- Hand it to me.

505
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:07,654
I cannot believe that story.

506
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:10,040
Yeah, well, trust me, the brothers Grimm

507
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,730
were over in the corner, yelling, "No way!"

508
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,378
- And she just walked out? 
- Yep.

509
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,761
- Jewelry appraisal? 
- Hand it to me.

510
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:17,198
Why don't you just tell me where to put it?

511
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,463
No, because I have a system.

512
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:21,479
That letter sounds awful.

513
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:23,214
- It was. 
- And really cruel.

514
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:26,454
So cruel -- so completely cruel that I'm kind of wondering

515
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,149
if Gran didn't know Mom was gonna find it.

516
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:29,434
Stop. It's too mean.

517
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,189
I don't wanna think that there's that meanness in my genes.

518
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,516
I don't wanna inherit something like that.

519
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:35,809
Yeah, well, who knows what we've inherited from that woman.

520
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:37,928
- Count your toes lately? 
- What are you talking about?

521
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:39,890
Well, I've been saving the best for last.

522
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:40,576
You're kidding.

523
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:42,532
Do you know what Gran's maiden name was?

524
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:43,166
What?

525
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,998
Gilmore.

526
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:46,213
Grandpa Charles was her second cousin!

527
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,227
- No! 
- Yes.

528
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,349
What does that mean about us?

529
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:52,341
What if that's caused, like, a horrible genetic mutation

530
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:53,586
that hasn't shown up yet?

531
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:55,751
- Oh, our eyes! 
- What?

532
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:56,803
We each have two of them.

533
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:58,993
I always thought it was neat that our eyes look kind of similar,

534
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:01,588
but now I don't know. Is it creepy?

535
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:03,345
- I don't know. Is it ?
- I think it's creepy.

536
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,892
Okay, just hand me some more stuff.

537
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:06,288
Stop staring at my eyes. Come on.

538
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:08,296
What else do you have to do?

539
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:12,443
Oh, well, I haven't tracked down this Reverend Wilder yet,

540
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:16,509
and I got some mysterious message from the place that made her headstone,

541
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,895
so I have to go see about that. And then there's just the random stuff.

542
00:21:18,996 --> 00:21:19,893
What random stuff?

543
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:22,790
Well, for instance, Gran requested

544
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,844
that she be buried in fresh clothing.

545
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:25,924
What is fresh clothing?

546
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,137
I don't know. Clean clothing?

547
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,917
Clothes fresh from the cleaners? New clothes?

548
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:32,446
- Clothes with a mountain-fresh scent? 
- I think it's new clothing.

549
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,722
It's safest, isn't it?

550
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:36,152
So add that to the list with the headstone.

551
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:38,837
Oh, and then there's the obituary. I almost forgot about the obituary.

552
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:39,824
What about the obituary?

553
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,559
The paper wrote something, but Dad thinks it's not good enough,

554
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:44,341
so I have to rewrite her death announcement.

555
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,533
I should let Mom do it.

556
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:47,203
I believe it would go, "yay."

557
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:48,948
Hey, can I do it? I want to help,

558
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,319
and we have access to a database at the Yale paper

559
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:52,788
that would make it really easy to research.

560
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:54,977
Oh, honey, that would be great. Thank you.

561
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:55,697
My pleasure.

562
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:58,708
I just feel really bad for Grandpa, losing his mother.

563
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,290
Well, they were really close.

564
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:01,990
Yeah. It's sad.

565
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,769
So, Gran and her husband had the same great-grandfather.

566
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:06,648
Try not to think about it.

567
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:10,638
Hello?

568
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:15,246
Oh. Mom, Dad?

569
00:22:16,214 --> 00:22:17,021
Look at all this stuff!

570
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:20,720
Mom, are you here?

571
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,998
In the living room, Lorelai.

572
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:25,926
Yeah. Where's the maid?

573
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:29,187
You got a condolence moat going on out here.

574
00:22:32,578 --> 00:22:35,117
I told Hilda to take the day off. Nothing's happening here.

575
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:37,478
I think every delivery boy in town would beg to differ.

576
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:40,067
What? Oh, those. Just put those anywhere.

577
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:43,263
I have to finish reading The Crimson Petal and the White for my book club.

578
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:46,652
Sookie, what a pleasant surprise!

579
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:47,349
What are you doing here?

580
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,684
I brought Sookie so she could check what equipment she's going to need

581
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,163
for the wake. And who the hell are you?!

582
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,569
- I'm so sorry, Emily. 
- About what?

583
00:22:53,729 --> 00:22:55,955
Well, about Richard's mother dying.

584
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:56,713
Are you?

585
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,984
- Would you like a cigarette? 
- No, thank you.

586
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:02,575
Well, then, more for me.

587
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:05,678
- I think she broke. 
- Mom, what's going on?

588
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:07,649
I am just gonna go to the kitchen.

589
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:11,556
- Mom! 
- Lorelai, please, I'm reading.

590
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:15,781
If you're going by the bar, my drink could use a little freshening up.

591
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:17,087
Your drink is fresh enough!

592
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:18,673
And put that cigarette out!

593
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:22,257
Hi, Jason.

594
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:23,690
Hey, I didn't know you were gonna be here.

595
00:23:23,907 --> 00:23:25,734
Oh, yeah, well, the white rabbit ran by.

596
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:28,401
I chased him, fell down a hole, and here I am.

597
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:29,855
So, how's everybody doing?

598
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:31,709
Well, Dad's a mess,

599
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:33,956
and Mom starts work at the truck stop next week.

600
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:34,858
Are you holding up?

601
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,604
Yeah, I am. Thanks for asking.

602
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:38,104
Well, it's what I'm here for.

603
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:39,241
- Really? 
- No.

604
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:40,986
I have to get your father's signature on some papers.

605
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:44,304
- Mom, where's Dad? 
- How the hell do I know?

606
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,443
Boy, she sounds really upset.

607
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:49,024
- He's probably in his study. 
- Okay, thanks.

608
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:50,909
Careful.

609
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:02,612
- Oh, Jason. 
- Richard, I am so sorry to hear.

610
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:11,185
Who was that at the door?

611
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,196
It was Jason. Dad needs to sign something.

612
00:24:13,346 --> 00:24:16,039
You know what? Why don't I start putting some of these baskets away?

613
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,745
Whatever.

614
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:19,217
And then maybe I could start writing some thank-you notes.

615
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:21,374
Fine. I think there's some Post-its in the kitchen.

616
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:28,398
Mom, I know how hurt you are.

617
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,288
That letter was terrible.

618
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:32,727
But there's still a lot of stuff that has to get done.

619
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:34,676
I know. You're right.

620
00:24:35,469 --> 00:24:37,682
Say, I've got an idea.

621
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:41,214
Why don't you call Pennilyn Lott and have her plan the funeral?

622
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:41,736
Mom.

623
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:44,004
I mean, she's the one that was supposed to be planning it anyhow,

624
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:46,370
so I say let her do it. You need something, Sookie?

625
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,603
I was just wondering if it's going to be okay

626
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:50,559
to set up a buffet in the dining room.

627
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,310
I don't know.

628
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:53,286
What do you think Pennilyn Lott would do?

629
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,062
You think she'd set it up in the dining room?

630
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:58,929
Because personally, I think we should just toss some cheese cubes in the coffin,

631
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:01,438
stuff some toothpicks in her mouth, and let the people go to town.

632
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,721
- Is she serious? 
- The dining room's fine, Sookie.

633
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,714
Okay. Good.

634
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,760
Excuse me.

635
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:12,918
Did you see that hug?

636
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,434
Yes, I saw the hug, I saw the hug.

637
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:17,700
It didn't end. It was the hug that wouldn't end,

638
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:19,456
and he was wearing a robe.

639
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:21,585
Yes, apparently, we're a robe family now.

640
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:22,655
And he was crying.

641
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:26,004
I am really, really bad at comforting people.

642
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:28,089
I say completely inappropriate things --

643
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:30,658
bad jokes with words like "Nantucket" in them.

644
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,373
- Did you get what you needed? 
- Yeah, thanks.

645
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:35,435
Okay. Then I guess I'll see you at the funeral tomorrow.

646
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,010
- Yeah. About the actual funeral. 
- Jason.

647
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:40,089
- I can't do funerals. 
- You have to do funerals.

648
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,333
This was your partner's mother.

649
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:43,955
I understand, but funerals have way too much emotion for me --

650
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,798
- the death and the hugging. 
- You serious?

651
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:48,010
When I was 10, my family went through a terrible period.

652
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:50,918
Once a month, somebody died. For a year, they were dropping like flies.

653
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:53,990
- It completely freaked me out. 
- Okay, fine, don't come,

654
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,013
but you had better lie to my father and tell him you did.

655
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,733
I am very comfortable with that compromise.

656
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:05,449
That was Jason again. He had to go,

657
00:26:05,552 --> 00:26:07,338
but he wanted me to tell you hello for him.

658
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:10,042
Jason. Your father loves that boy.

659
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:10,951
I know he does.

660
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:12,407
You know who else would love that boy?

661
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:13,754
Pennilyn Lott.

662
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:16,231
I'm gonna go get started on those thank-you cards.

663
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:20,686
Remember to thank Pennilyn Lott just for being Pennilyn Lott.

664
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:26,247
I'm almost done. I promise I'll get it to the paper this afternoon.

665
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,192
This is a really big help, my friend. I owe you.

666
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,768
No, it was really interesting, actually.

667
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,611
I mean, I never knew all of these things about Gran.

668
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:33,322
Really, was the extra-toe thing in there?

669
00:26:33,431 --> 00:26:35,663
No, but did you know that she took care of wounded soldiers

670
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,593
that were shipped back here during World War II?

671
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:41,423
She also studied at the Sorbonne and at Oxford and met three presidents.

672
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,554
Oh. Which ones?

673
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:43,798
Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon.

674
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:45,842
There's this amazing picture of her frowning at Nixon

675
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:47,296
like she knew he was up to something.

676
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:47,919
Really?

677
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:50,137
Yeah, she was some kind of something, wasn't she?

678
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,463
Yes, she kind of was.

679
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:53,629
I just love that she wanted something so...

680
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:55,123
I got to go.

681
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:58,626
Hi, Doyle. Hey, did you read the typo in the New York Times today?

682
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:00,495
This is personal.

683
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,645
Yes. Yes, it is.

684
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:05,281
You're using newspaper resources to work on something personal,

685
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,180
in direct defiance of what I was warning everybody about just the other day.

686
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,706
- But this is different. 
- Oh, it is?

687
00:27:09,823 --> 00:27:12,261
- If I can just... 
- Oh, goody, here comes the defense.

688
00:27:12,393 --> 00:27:15,199
What will it be? "I'm looking something up for a friend?"

689
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:16,972
"The professor didn't give me enough time?"

690
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,781
"I was just browsing through the archives, and I got distracted?"

691
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:22,070
My grandmother is dead.

692
00:27:23,027 --> 00:27:25,511
Oh. Oh, no.

693
00:27:25,613 --> 00:27:29,086
Yeah, she died two days ago, suddenly, and we were close. Okay?

694
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:31,320
We were close, and I'm just trying to give her

695
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:35,234
an obituary that is fitting for the great woman that she was.

696
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:36,150
Oh. That's...

697
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,264
- I didn't know. 
- You didn't ask.

698
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:41,281
My grandmother died in December, and it was...

699
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:44,865
I'm still not over it.

700
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,512
I know exactly what you're going through.

701
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:49,785
Keep going, please. I'm sorry.

702
00:27:50,216 --> 00:27:50,937
It's okay.

703
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,647
And thank you.

704
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,158
Last week, you know what I did?

705
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:01,270
No.

706
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:02,662
I picked up the phone to call her.

707
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:03,790
Isn't that sad?

708
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:07,066
I actually forgot, and then, of course, it hit me all over again.

709
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,509
I hope that doesn't happen to you.

710
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:09,211
Me too.

711
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:10,747
She smelled a little like coffee.

712
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:13,030
I still can't walk past any place that makes coffee.

713
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:16,424
The girl I was dating was a barista. I had to break up with her.

714
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:18,074
- We weren't that close. 
- What?

715
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:20,572
And it wasn't my grandmother. It was my great-grandmother.

716
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,081
I dropped the "great" to make the whole thing sound sadder.

717
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:25,329
I don't know anything about her until today.

718
00:28:25,544 --> 00:28:29,895
I'm so sorry. I'm just gonna pack up and go straight to hell now.

719
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,061
My grandmother was a very special woman.

720
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:36,179
She drove me to my prom, and I'd be a poor man if I'd never known her.

721
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:38,687
Finish the obituary.

722
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:40,346
- What? 
- What?

723
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:42,179
Everybody should get to know their grandmother.

724
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:43,797
But it was her great-grandmother. Didn't you hear her?

725
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:47,679
Glenn, you take Rory's piece on the new parking rules, okay?

726
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:50,961
My month lasts a month. Your month lasts three days.

727
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:53,162
Yes, sirree, folks, that is my life!

728
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:04,543
Oh, Kirk, good, I've been...

729
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:06,208
What are we listening to?

730
00:29:07,284 --> 00:29:08,553
- Again? 
- Yep.

731
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:13,458
- Who needs to order? 
- I do.

732
00:29:13,597 --> 00:29:14,194
Go ahead.

733
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,155
- I'll have a chef's salad. 
- Dressing?

734
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:18,275
- Oil and vinegar on the side. 
- Crackers or roll?

735
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,190
Get the crackers, get the crackers.

736
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,640
- I'll have the...
- Luke!

737
00:29:21,783 --> 00:29:23,135
- What? 
- Are you coming back?

738
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:23,970
I'm working.

739
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:26,121
We were having a discussion and you just got up and left.

740
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:27,268
I thought we were done.

741
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,762
I was in the middle of the word "September."

742
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,610
Okay, come on.

743
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,275
Okay, go ahead.

744
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:40,713
We were in the middle of a conversation!

745
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:41,900
We were yelling. It was a fight.

746
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,513
- We weren't yelling. 
- It felt like yelling.

747
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:44,952
Okay, we won't yell. We'll talk.

748
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,580
- Fine, talk. 
- Me? What about you?

749
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:48,280
You're the one who wanted to talk. We're here. Let's talk.

750
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:49,892
- You don't want to talk? 
- I don't have anything to say.

751
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:54,490
Yeah. Me either.

752
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,208
Nicole.

753
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,596
What?

754
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:03,973
You going back to our place?

755
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:04,976
Our place?

756
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:07,972
Our place.

757
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:10,748
Funny.

758
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:28,324
Dad, why are you answering the door?

759
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,721
Well, I heard it ring, so...

760
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:32,917
The maid's taking the day off again?

761
00:30:33,107 --> 00:30:34,325
Yeah, I suppose so.

762
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:36,492
Rory, it's nice to see you.

763
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:38,262
I'm so sorry, Grandpa.

764
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:39,433
Thank you, Rory.

765
00:30:39,643 --> 00:30:40,480
How are you?

766
00:30:40,686 --> 00:30:43,555
Well, I'm having a devil of a time with this tie.

767
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:45,671
And you're not wearing any shoes.

768
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,903
What? Oh, yeah, shoes.

769
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:49,975
Dad, can't Mom help you with the tie?

770
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:51,246
Yes. Yes.

771
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:54,298
I don't know where she's gotten to.

772
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:56,934
There are a lot of plans to make.

773
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,687
Oh, someone sent us four hams. Can you imagine?

774
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,045
Four hams.

775
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:03,274
Mom, there you are.

776
00:31:03,432 --> 00:31:05,829
Rory, you look very nice.

777
00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:07,195
I brought a dress to change into.

778
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:08,351
Oh, what you're wearing is fine.

779
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:11,834
Lorelai, here, I just finished reading, and I think you'll really like it.

780
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:14,567
It's about this prostitute named Sugar in Victorian England.

781
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:16,616
She starts rising through the ranks of society,

782
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,987
and she meets these really vivid characters!

783
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:20,872
Okay, sure, you don't have to tell me the whole story now.

784
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,785
I'm not giving anything away. That's all on the back cover.

785
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:24,736
Dad? Follow him. Point out doors and windows.

786
00:31:24,854 --> 00:31:25,350
Got it.

787
00:31:25,704 --> 00:31:29,023
So, Mom, you might want to go get ready now.

788
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:31,198
Nonsense! We have hours. Want a drink?

789
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,432
Today I learned how to make mojitos!

790
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:36,616
Mom, today especially, you might want to be early,

791
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:37,998
since we're the ones throwing the funeral.

792
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:38,838
Fine.

793
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,195
There you go. Go on upstairs.

794
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,325
Put on a dress -- a black dress.

795
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:43,882
I got him to sit down.

796
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,310
Okay, pillow. Soft. Good.

797
00:31:45,443 --> 00:31:46,646
You're right, they're a little nutty.

798
00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:47,973
Oh, yeah. With extra nuts on top.

799
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:52,600
Okay, I have to check and make sure that Sookie's kitchen stuff made it over here.

800
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:55,289
And I have to call the airline and make sure the reverend got on the plane.

801
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,522
I have to check in with the headstone...

802
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,314
- Underwear. 
- That took a turn.

803
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:00,444
Oh, my God.

804
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:04,262
I delivered Gran's clothes to the funeral home,

805
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:06,814
but I forgot to include underwear.

806
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:08,227
Gran's going commando?

807
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:10,602
Oh, no. I'll have to go buy some.

808
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,646
Well, wait a minute. Who's gonna know?

809
00:32:13,803 --> 00:32:15,312
I'll know. Just stay here.

810
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:16,936
Keep an eye on your grandpa. I'll be right back.

811
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:27,939
This whole section is our 2-for-1 sale.

812
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:29,777
- Listen... 
- Shannon.

813
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:32,895
Shannon, I need to buy something for my grandmother.

814
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:34,027
Any particular style?

815
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,561
Something respectable, upstanding.

816
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,323
You got anything that came over on the Mayflower?

817
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:41,394
We have this whole line of really terrific panties,

818
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,943
and they have a built-in tummy panel that older women really love.

819
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,668
Oh, well, tummy panel sounds great.

820
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:47,908
- What size is she? 
- Size?

821
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:50,842
She's tiny but strong.

822
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:52,850
She looks like she could take a punch.

823
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:57,871
But she wears these big dresses, so who knows what's going on under there.

824
00:32:57,995 --> 00:32:58,972
Okay, well...

825
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:01,205
I'm sorry, she wore big dresses.

826
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:04,211
She wore big dresses, 'cause she's dead.

827
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:07,000
Do you have any idea what "fresh clothing" means?

828
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:08,465
- No. 
- Neither do I.

829
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,497
I'm guessing it means "new," and that's why I'm here,

830
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:14,092
because I have to do all the planning now,

831
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,853
because my mother found the note.

832
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:21,511
The stupid note. Who writes a note like that and keeps the carbon?

833
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,357
- I don't... 
- Yeah, my grandmother -- that's who.

834
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:26,375
My grandmother, who wants fresh clothing

835
00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:28,202
and a 4,000-year-old minister,

836
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:31,105
who wants to be cremated

837
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,393
and put in a jar on top of my mother's mantelpiece

838
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,446
to sit up there and judge for all eternity.

839
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:39,907
I bet your family's looking really great to you right about now, huh?

840
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:41,597
- Yes, they are. 
- Yeah.

841
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:43,603
Oh, God.

842
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:49,128
I'm just babbling. I'm standing in underwire heaven just babbling

843
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,388
like a crazy person.

844
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:53,321
I should just pick something, because,

845
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:56,317
I mean, what difference does it make? She's dead.

846
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:58,836
You know, the woman is dead.

847
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:03,156
She can't tell what she's wearing or who bought it for her.

848
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,158
She can't see the mess she's left behind, so...

849
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,675
I'll just... I'll take this.

850
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:11,846
- That's a small. 
- Hello! She's dead!

851
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:14,535
The woman is dead! She can't tell if it's the right size!

852
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:17,883
She wanted fresh clothes, and I'm here buying her fresh clothes.

853
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,463
So if she has a problem with the size or the strawberry print,

854
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:22,822
then she can rise from the dead and come back here

855
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,877
and yell at me herself. Because you know what,

856
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:30,171
if anyone could, that tough, old, crazy, wonderful broad would be the one!

857
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,674
You take Visa, right?

858
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:38,515
Okay, so, according to this, we're almost home.

859
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:41,772
I just pull this through there, which looks promising,

860
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:45,081
and we're done. Now you just do the final adjusting.

861
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:46,591
Well, that's not bad.

862
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:47,999
Fourth time's the charm.

863
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:50,231
Very handy little sheet you've got there. Where'd you get it?

864
00:34:50,374 --> 00:34:51,926
Off the internet. You can find anything there.

865
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:53,645
Very nice.

866
00:34:54,655 --> 00:34:55,560
Do you want to keep it...

867
00:34:55,945 --> 00:34:58,310
the diagram? I don't think I'll be needing it much around the dorm

868
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:01,310
Well, in that case, I will.

869
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,237
Thank you, Rory.

870
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:04,485
Now I think all we need is your jacket

871
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:05,918
and your shoes, and you're ready.

872
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:08,058
Yes, I suppose so.

873
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,282
You know, the suit I wore when we buried my father...

874
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,508
I was never able to wear it again.

875
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,329
It was brand-new -- a very nice suit.

876
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:21,924
Custom-made. It was my first custom-made suit.

877
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:25,001
I told your grandmother that it didn't fit anymore,

878
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,772
but really, I just didn't want to see it again.

879
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,878
And I suppose this is going to be it for this suit, too.

880
00:35:33,654 --> 00:35:36,495
So, I hear you're doing the eulogy.

881
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:38,422
Well, I'm her son.

882
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:40,571
Are you gonna be okay doing that?

883
00:35:40,816 --> 00:35:42,235
Well, I'll have to be, I suppose.

884
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:44,550
Because if you find yourself feeling,

885
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:47,534
you know, unsteady about it, I can do it.

886
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:49,931
I did a lot of reading about Gran for the obituary,

887
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:51,508
and I think I can do her justice.

888
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,126
She had a life, didn't she?

889
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:54,067
She really did.

890
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:56,561
Well, I thank you for your offer,

891
00:35:56,745 --> 00:36:01,205
but this is my responsibility. I will be fine.

892
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:02,403
I'm sure you will.

893
00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:06,470
However, if something happens, and I find myself, let us say,

894
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,772
a tad more emotional than I would like -

895
00:36:08,906 --> 00:36:10,037
I got your back, Grandpa.

896
00:36:17,824 --> 00:36:20,891
Did you go shopping? I've been sitting here waiting for you.

897
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:27,799
Thank you. Thanks so much for coming. Appreciate it.

898
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,677
Nice job with the eulogy, Gilmore.

899
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:33,088
Well, I've always found that a well-tied bow tie

900
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:34,618
can have a very steadying effect.

901
00:36:35,437 --> 00:36:37,163
Richard, she was a hell of a lady.

902
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,205
I don't know what the hospital board will do without her.

903
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,190
I appreciate both of you coming.

904
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:44,049
Have you met my granddaughter Rory?

905
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:45,371
No, I don't believe we have.

906
00:36:45,462 --> 00:36:46,431
Nice to meet you, Rory.

907
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,327
Nice to meet you, too.

908
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,628
I'm gonna go get a soda. Excuse me.

909
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:51,034
She's lovely, Richard.

910
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:52,508
Inside and out.

911
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:53,935
How's he doing?

912
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,097
Not bad. He's holding it together --

913
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:59,189
partly because all these people are here, but I think he's doing better.

914
00:36:59,347 --> 00:36:59,942
Good.

915
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:03,736
So, what did you think of Gran's fabulous, fresh clothing?

916
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:05,937
I thought it was very sophisticated.

917
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:07,161
Thank you.

918
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,538
But don't think, for a second,

919
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:10,639
that I didn't notice the Hello Kitty bracelet you put on her.

920
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:13,771
I just thought, a little something special from me and you for all eternity.

921
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:17,290
So, there she was, dragging poor Charles around Egypt,

922
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:20,459
of all places. I mean, the man detested sand.

923
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,226
So, of course, Lorelai wanted to go and see the pyramids right away.

924
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:27,324
He was dragging his feet. He wanted to go to the hotel.

925
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:31,276
He said, "Lorelai, those pyramids have been there for thousands of years,

926
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:33,519
so they can wait another day." And she said,

927
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,073
"Well, you didn't marry the pyramids. You married me,

928
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,121
and I won't wait another hour."

929
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,578
And she jumped on a camel and rode away.

930
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:44,538
Dragged the camel's owner behind her for over a mile.

931
00:37:44,686 --> 00:37:45,947
Man almost died.

932
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:50,969
There she is. Lorelai, come here

933
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:53,616
and say hello to your father's favorite cousin.

934
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:54,886
Hi, Marilyn.

935
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:58,092
Look at you. You look just like your picture.

936
00:37:58,337 --> 00:38:01,881
You know, your grandmother had this picture of you right smack-dab

937
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:04,660
in the middle of her entryway. You would walk in the door,

938
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:06,564
she would point to the picture, and she would say,

939
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:09,687
"This is my granddaughter, Lorelai. She's not married."

940
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,121
Oh, that's a terrific story.

941
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:12,611
You are stunning!

942
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:15,933
My god, tell me you're an idiot, I beg you.

943
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:17,551
I have my moments. How's that?

944
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,792
And you, miss.

945
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:21,930
Am I possibly related to you also?

946
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:23,788
Yes, this is my daughter Rory.

947
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:26,210
It is a thrill to meet you both.

948
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:28,555
Horrible circumstances, I suppose.

949
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:33,885
Anyway angels, tell me: when you were last over at your grandmother's house,

950
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:37,104
did you possibly notice some darling little bar glasses?

951
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:38,129
Bar glasses?

952
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:40,823
Crystal, with this little gold-leaf pattern around?

953
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,133
No, I don't think so.

954
00:38:42,434 --> 00:38:44,443
Oh, well, I was just wondering.

955
00:38:44,564 --> 00:38:47,008
They weren't valuable, just sentimental.

956
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:49,540
I used to admire them as a small child.

957
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,691
Well, sure, what little kid doesn't have a fascination with bar glasses?

958
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,077
- Well, if you ever do see them... 
- Yes, I'll let you know.

959
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:58,440
I'm sorry, I have to go check the caterer.

960
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:59,179
Go, go, go.

961
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:02,337
- I can visit with Rory. 
- Okay.

962
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:05,031
Hey, I heard you talking about Gran in Egypt.

963
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:07,299
Oh, she loved Egypt.

964
00:39:07,488 --> 00:39:09,896
Actually, she loved anyplace exotic.

965
00:39:10,032 --> 00:39:13,985
Did she ever tell you about the time she was stranded in Istanbul?

966
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:16,846
No. Well, I actually didn't know her very well.

967
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:18,809
Oh, that's a terrible shame.

968
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:20,145
I think so, too.

969
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,500
It was a lovely service. You did a wonderful job.

970
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:23,564
Thank you.

971
00:39:23,852 --> 00:39:25,951
It seems like we're hitting that age, now aren't we,

972
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,938
where we're going to be going to a lot of these things.

973
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,211
Time to invest in a second black suit, I suppose.

974
00:39:30,354 --> 00:39:32,637
Excuse me, please bring my husband a Manhattan,

975
00:39:32,729 --> 00:39:34,788
and make sure the hors d'oeuvres start with him. He has to eat something.

976
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:39,180
Yeah, I think philosophy may be one of my favorite subjects right now.

977
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:41,023
- Second cousin. 
- Got to go.

978
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:42,406
Wait, I'll come with you.

979
00:39:43,596 --> 00:39:45,381
Reverend Wilder, hi.

980
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:49,395
Thank you so much for coming all the way up here from Florida to be with us.

981
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:51,116
Gran would have been so pleased.

982
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,234
Oh, thank you. I was happy to do it.

983
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:57,056
- And you are? 
- I'm Lorelai Gilmore.

984
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,027
Didn't I just bury you?

985
00:39:59,154 --> 00:40:01,950
No, Reverend, I'm the one who talked to you on the phone,

986
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:03,302
and I picked you up from the airport.

987
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,833
- Oh, really? 
- Yeah.

988
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:06,517
That was a different Lorelai.

989
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,352
This is her granddaughter. This is the reigning Lorelai.

990
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:11,586
Oh, how nice.

991
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:13,269
And who are you?

992
00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:15,324
This is Gran's niece, Marilyn.

993
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:17,879
You remember me from when I was younger.

994
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,315
You married me to my first husband, Theodore.

995
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:21,089
I did?

996
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:24,606
It would be easier on all of us if you can just pretend to remember.

997
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,658
Oh, well, that's probably a good idea.

998
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,461
How are you holding up?

999
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,006
My feet are killing me.

1000
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,034
How's the rest of you?

1001
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:46,623
The rest of me? The rest of me is fine.

1002
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,048
Oh, you know, Mom,

1003
00:40:50,144 --> 00:40:52,670
she may have written that letter, but he picked you.

1004
00:40:54,846 --> 00:40:57,139
I can't believe you wore those shoes to a funeral.

1005
00:40:59,555 --> 00:41:01,210
I'm going to go get a stuffed mushroom now.

1006
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:11,751
Your tie is crooked.

1007
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,490
- Have you eaten? 
- Oh, yes.

1008
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:17,040
Every five minutes, it seems a young man

1009
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:19,185
would show up at my side with a tray of food.

1010
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:21,024
- Your doing, I suppose. 
- Could be.

1011
00:41:21,361 --> 00:41:22,821
There, that's better.

1012
00:41:23,093 --> 00:41:24,956
So, I've been thinking.

1013
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:25,853
Yes?

1014
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:30,241
I'm not so sure the mantel is the best place for Gran's ashes.

1015
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:31,060
What?

1016
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:33,359
The ledge is too small. It wouldn't really be appropriate.

1017
00:41:33,476 --> 00:41:34,167
But her wishes.

1018
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:35,760
Being buried with my father...

1019
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:39,225
seems right. Don't you agree?

1020
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:42,579
Whatever you want, Richard.

1021
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:47,203
So, there she is, Aunt Lorelai,

1022
00:41:47,325 --> 00:41:49,656
already in her 70s, mind you,

1023
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:53,256
and the blizzard has her trapped in that old house for a week

1024
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:55,713
with no heat, no running water.

1025
00:41:56,107 --> 00:41:59,313
The local police finally came and dug her out

1026
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:02,758
and handed her some hot tea. And you know what she does?

1027
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:05,762
First of all, she complains that the tea is too hot,

1028
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:08,979
and then she sends them a bill for carpet cleaning,

1029
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:10,669
because they tracked in snow.

1030
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:12,174
So, you ditched the cousin?

1031
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:14,755
Yeah, we ran into a sister, and how could I compete?

1032
00:42:14,891 --> 00:42:15,583
Oh, sure.

1033
00:42:16,168 --> 00:42:16,879
How are you doing?

1034
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:18,282
I'm feeling sadder about Gran,

1035
00:42:18,414 --> 00:42:21,795
but feeling sadder is making me feel less guilty about not feeling sad,

1036
00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:23,392
- so things are looking up. 
- Good.

1037
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:26,449
So, apparently, I am now the reigning Lorelai.

1038
00:42:26,618 --> 00:42:28,291
I guess you are.

1039
00:42:28,523 --> 00:42:30,601
- It's a lot of responsibility. 
- Well, sure.

1040
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:32,720
It's mostly ceremonial stuff nowadays --

1041
00:42:32,798 --> 00:42:34,477
declaring knighthoods, opening supermarkets --

1042
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,179
but now and then, you get to banish someone or pose for a stamp.

1043
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:38,424
Neat. And coins.

1044
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:39,408
Yeah and coins.

1045
00:42:39,622 --> 00:42:41,301
You know, someday you'll be the reigning Lorelai.

1046
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,423
I don't like that idea.

1047
00:42:42,623 --> 00:42:43,682
Why not? You get a cape.

1048
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:46,549
Because if I'm the reigning Lorelai, that means you'll be gone.

1049
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:48,567
Gone? No, not me.

1050
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,225
I'll step down way before that.

1051
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,970
I'm not gonna pull a Queen Elizabeth on you, make you wait around forever,

1052
00:42:53,056 --> 00:42:55,775
force you to develop interests in polo and architecture.

1053
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:57,670
- I am scared of horses. 
- I know that.

1054
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,328
So, there's a cape, huh?

1055
00:43:02,694 --> 00:43:06,226
