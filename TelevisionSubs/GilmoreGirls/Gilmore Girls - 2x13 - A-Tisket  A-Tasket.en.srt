1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,962
Previously on Gilmore girls:

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,214
Luke is a great guy.

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,381
He's very special.

4
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,383
You're incredibly lucky to have him.

5
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,468
Are you sleeping with him?

6
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,594
Excuse me?

7
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,221
- I have to go.
- Can I get your number?

8
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,640
Last name's Kim.
We're the only ones in Stars Hollow.

9
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,392
I just gave my number
to a potential Korean doctor.

10
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:21,063
You don't know anything about me,
or my life, or my mom, or Luke.

11
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,315
So why don't you Dr. Laura someone else?

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,526
I'm going inside. Stay out of my fridge.

13
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,027
- Hello.
- Hold on.

14
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,321
- Henry?
- Here.

15
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,364
- Lane?
- Here.

16
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,657
Okay, talk to you later.

17
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,325
Rory, how are you?

18
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,743
I'm good. How're you doing?

19
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,787
- Jackson?
- What?

20
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,039
Would you like to go to dinner sometime...

21
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,165
with me?

22
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,291
Okay.

23
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,334
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,628
That kid is more screwed up
than you think he is.

25
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,838
What are you talking about?

26
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,840
Get off me, man, I'm not fighting you.

27
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,216
Jess, knock it off man.

28
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,676
What the hell is your problem?

29
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,844
Nothing.

30
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:55,389
- I'm not ready for marriage.
- Okay.

31
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,975
However, I'd be willing to move in.

32
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,270
- Move in where?
- Move in with you.

33
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,023
Jackson, you're hilarious.

34
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,358
You stole my book.

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,485
I just wanted to put
some notes in the margins.

36
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,863
- You've read this before.
- About 40 times.

37
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,447
I thought said you didn't read much.

38
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,992
- Good night, Rory.
- Good night, Dodger.

39
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,162
- Dodger?
- Figure it out.

40
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,291
Oliver Twist.

41
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,887
I've decided I'm saving myself
for William Holden.

42
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,847
It's nice out here in left field.

43
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,099
Sunset Boulevard was on last night.

44
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,810
I've known him for years,
Sabrina, Stalag 17...

45
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,062
- yet, last night, something snapped.
- I'll say.

46
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,231
- It was the monkey scene.
- You know he's dead?

47
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,774
- The monkey?
- William Holden.

48
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,943
Every great relationship has its obstacles.

49
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,987
You'd know
if you weren't dating Andy Hardy.

50
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,280
- This one?
- No.

51
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,365
- Why?
- It's too big. It raises expectations.

52
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,284
Like there's a home-cooked lunch in there?

53
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,078
Instead of the leftovers
in our refrigerator? Exactly.

54
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,580
Okay. Going back on the pile now.

55
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,040
It's quaint, isn't it?

56
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,001
The women make a nice lunch basket,
the men bid on it...

57
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,128
and the world rotates
backwards on its axis.

58
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,338
I think it's fun.

59
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,466
That's because you have a pretty boy
to bid on your basket.

60
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,801
- Yes, I do.
- Did you tell him to eat lunch first?

61
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,387
I love him. Of course.
I'm gonna look in the back.

62
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,723
All right, I'll hit the front.

63
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,726
Patty, shopping for baskets?

64
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,938
- Please. I bought my basket weeks ago.
- Always prepared.

65
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,648
I'm getting that itch again.

66
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,609
No, Patty. You don't actually
need another husband.

67
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,529
Need? No. But want?
That's a different story.

68
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,323
Listen, darling, do you happen
to have change for $1?

69
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,700
- I think so.
- I don't know where my quarters go.

70
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,746
- Down some guy's G-string, I expect.
- No. A quarter would be insulting.

71
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,207
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you so...

72
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,376
- I got it.
- No, that's okay.

73
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,879
This is a picture of me.

74
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,881
- It is?
- Yeah.

75
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,302
- Why do you have a picture of me?
- Well, it's a very nice picture.

76
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,763
Thank you. Why do you have
a very nice picture of me?

77
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,306
- I'm a stalker?
- Or?

78
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,309
Or when, in my daily travels...

79
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,813
- I run across a nice, single guy...
- Oh, God!

80
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,817
I like to have a visual aid to help me
with the wonderful buildup I give you.

81
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,153
I appreciate the gesture,
but I don't need you to set me up.

82
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,699
You're such a beautiful girl,
and you deserve a nice guy.

83
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,326
I'll have a nice guy,
but let me find him, okay?

84
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,828
But you're no good at finding him.

85
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,205
- Patty.
- All right.

86
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,208
Thank you. I'll keep this, if you don't mind.

87
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,461
Stubborn girl.

88
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,716
Not that one.

89
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,510
- You get no say in the basket.
- I have to bid on it.

90
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,805
And you have to eat what's inside,
and get no say on that either.

91
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,348
- Hey.
- Yeah?

92
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,642
- Is Taylor behind me?
- No.

93
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,151
What, Taylor?

94
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,236
- Jess.
- Sorry to intrude.

95
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,321
Why did you?

96
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,032
You're having a vertical
From Here To Eternity moment...

97
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,867
right in front of the super glue.

98
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,703
Not that that's not
an appropriate place, but...

99
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,748
- Here's your glue.
- Thanks. As you were.

100
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,293
- I really hate that guy.
- He didn't do anything.

101
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,212
He's here, he's breathing. That's enough.

102
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,464
- I wish you two could start over.
- Why?

103
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:19,134
He lives here. We run into him. He goes
to your school. It would be easier.

104
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,763
- I'm fine with the whole hating him thing.
- I think it's a waste of energy.

105
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,516
- I'll have a PowerBar.
- Fine. Forget it.

106
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,478
So, I should probably get back to work.
We still on for tonight?

107
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,273
- I don't know. I might be baking.
- I'll pick you up at 7:00.

108
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,860
- Get that one. It's nice and small.
- Bye.

109
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,409
- God!
- Sorry.

110
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,995
Two-for-one sale.

111
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,473
Independence Inn. Lorelai speaking.

112
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,185
Sure. What dates are you looking at?

113
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,103
Hold on one sec.

114
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,774
Would you like a king or a queen-size bed?
You have your choice.

115
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,653
I've got a room with the king-size
and a room with two queens.

116
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,826
Well, do you think you'll make up by then?

117
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,914
Yikes! I would take the room
with the two queens.

118
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,920
Oh, God! Sorry.
No, nothing. Nothing's wrong.

119
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,963
Everything's... Yes, great.

120
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,925
Call me back when you know.
Okay. Thank you.

121
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,638
So, Patty has taken it upon herself
to find me a man.

122
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,847
- Really?
- Yes.

123
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,518
In my hand I have the pictures
and resumes of the top three contenders.

124
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,852
- Anyone good?
- No.

125
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,522
Two of them have run with the bulls.
This is humiliating.

126
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,731
I can find my own man.

127
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,651
- She just loves you.
- Yeah, but, you know...

128
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,279
- Sookie? L...
- Jackson, don't look! Cover your eyes!

129
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,533
Okay, I'm sorry. Now, why am I doing this?

130
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,953
Because I'm baking for the picnic,
and it's supposed to be a surprise.

131
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,997
Sure. Never see a pie before an auction.
It's bad luck.

132
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,751
You talk. I have to call Patty
and stop the forced mating process.

133
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,169
I feel like Ling-Ling the panda.

134
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:03,090
One of them's seen Ghostbusters
124 times. Can you say 'score'?

135
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,800
Okay. What's up?

136
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:09,137
I'm sorry, can I put my hand down?
I need to look at you when I talk.

137
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,266
Hold on.

138
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,727
Go.

139
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,730
I got a call from my landlord
reminding me my lease is up...

140
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,190
at the end of this month.

141
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,235
He wanted to know whether I was
gonna re-up it or not.

142
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,446
But I told him
that I had to talk to you first.

143
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,575
- Okay. About what?
- About re-upping my lease.

144
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,119
So what do you think?

145
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,956
About re-upping your lease?
Well, you have a very nice kitchen.

146
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,040
Yes. I know.

147
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,586
I like your living room, though that house
across the street has that...

148
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,296
creepy Miami Beach blue...

149
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,923
which means, in the day,
you can't look out your window.

150
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,427
- But at night it's not so bad.
- Forget about the house across the street.

151
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,306
If you forget about the house across
the street, I don't see why you shouldn't.

152
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,640
- You don't?
- No.

153
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:58,979
Okay. Fine.
I just wanted to check with you first.

154
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,772
I appreciate that.

155
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:04,109
So I guess I'll go re-up my lease then.

156
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,737
- Sounds good.
- Yeah. Sounds good.

157
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,658
- Know what's great about the festival?
- What?

158
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,952
It always falls on the day after trash day.

159
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:18,248
So everything you forgot to throw out,
and would be stuck with for a week...

160
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,460
you can instead put in a pretty basket
and auction off for charity.

161
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,836
That is wonderful.

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,254
I've got it all worked out.

163
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,883
I invited my cousin David
to come and bid on my basket...

164
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,510
you know, to keep my mother happy.

165
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,137
Then we tell my mom
we're gonna go eat at the park...

166
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,766
where Henry's gonna call on the payphone
at 2:00 for the alI's clear sign.

167
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,643
Then David will disappear.

168
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,187
Henry will arrive,
and we'll have our first date.

169
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,271
My head is spinning.

170
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,982
- Stash this at Miss Patty's.
- Don't you need it for David?

171
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,400
No, my mom packed that one.

172
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,237
Homemade granola, wheatgrass juice,
soy-chicken taco.

173
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,655
Our lunches are looking good.

174
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,697
This is the Henry basket.

175
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,284
I went by Gianelli's
and got meatball heroes and some chips.

176
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,120
I also packed a change of clothes,
makeup, makeup remover...

177
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,581
- and three temporary tattoos.
- 'Cause four is trashy.

178
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,167
I gotta go. Got to sneak back in my house!

179
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,419
I'm so excited!

180
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:09,675
Man. I remember the days of lying
to my mother about a boy.

181
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,470
Once I had a boy hidden in the closet.
Of course Mom wouldn't leave.

182
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,098
I finally pretended to get sick
to get her out...

183
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:20,018
long enough for him to climb out
the window and down the tree.

184
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:24,064
He fell. Broke his leg. To be young again.

185
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:30,237
Sold for $15 to the man in the yellow!
Thank you very much.

186
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,366
Now, the next basket I have here
is a lovely green-wicker number...

187
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,995
that would be a charming addition
to any room once the lunch is gone.

188
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,956
- Let's start the bidding at $5. Do I hear $5?
- $5.

189
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,418
- Okay, I have $5. Do I hear $10?
- $10.

190
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,591
- Withdrawn.
- Okay, I'm still at $5. Do I hear $10?

191
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,053
$5 going once, $5 going twice.

192
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,182
Sold to the young man for $5!

193
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,518
You know what's nice?
You can put extra rolls of...

194
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,062
toilet paper in there
and stick it in the bathroom.

195
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,148
Decorative and convenient.

196
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,400
- This may not look like much...
- Mine.

197
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,443
Nice.

198
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,112
But remember, people,
good things come in small packages.

199
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,573
How badly does he want to be hosting
a game show?

200
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,616
He can taste it.

201
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,618
Let's start the bidding at $3.

202
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,328
$5.

203
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,289
He's good. He's very good.

204
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,875
- $5. Do I hear $10?
- $10.

205
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,753
- Okay, I have $10. Do I hear $15?
- $20.

206
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,880
- $20, do I hear $25?
- $30.

207
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,175
You boys don't seem to understand
the way this works.

208
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,927
- $40.
- $50.

209
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,721
Have either of you noticed
how tiny this thing is?

210
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,807
- $75.
- We're not talking sense, gentlemen...

211
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,434
- Dean's hesitating.
- $80.

212
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,729
- He doesn't have $80 to spend on a basket.
- $90.

213
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,774
You know, I don't think he'll have to.

214
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:53,487
Okay, we've got $90 going once,
$90 going twice...

215
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:58,200
sold to the nice young hoodlum
in the back for $90.

216
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:02,287
I'm trying to think in what scenario
this could be construed as positive.

217
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,998
- Well?
- No one's head is on fire.

218
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,417
- I better go talk to Dean.
- Do you want help?

219
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,712
No, it's okay. I'm just officially
not a fan of unpredictability.

220
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,965
Totally understand. Good luck.

221
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,884
$5 on this one. Do I hear $5?

222
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,720
$5, that's good. How about $10?

223
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,349
- I'll go $10.
- $10. Let's keep going. Look at its size.

224
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,435
I'm gonna kill him!

225
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,438
- He's probably just fooling around.
- He was messing with me!

226
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,608
He was messing with me,
and it's the last time, I swear to God.

227
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,360
- Calm down.
- Why would he do this?

228
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,820
Maybe he was hungry.

229
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,947
- He's trying to make me crazy.
- Don't let him.

230
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,409
Of all the nutty, barn-raising shindigs
this town can cook up...

231
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,660
this one wasn't half bad.

232
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,037
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- I did. Shall we?

233
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,789
- Shall we what?
- Shall we go?

234
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,040
- Go where?
- Go eat.

235
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,125
Excuse me?

236
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,919
Person who buys the basket
wins the company of the person...

237
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,004
who makes the basket.

238
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,883
Basket. Basket maker.
Guy who didn't bring enough money.

239
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,009
You think this is funny?

240
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,511
It's no Lenny Bruce routine,
but it has its moments.

241
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:00,596
Bye, Jess.

242
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,264
- Where you going?
- You're going.

243
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,725
- As soon as Rory's ready.
- She's not going with you.

244
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,810
- Is that true?
- Yes, it's true.

245
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,688
Excuse me, Edgar Bergen,
I'd like Charlie McCarthy to answer.

246
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,148
- Shut up.
- Dean.

247
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,983
- What?
- Well...

248
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,444
- Come on.
- It's tradition.

249
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,695
I don't believe this.

250
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,281
My mother and I
have been doing this every year.

251
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,699
So buck tradition.

252
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,785
Do you remember how mad Taylor was
when I couldn't go...

253
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,162
to the turkey-calling contest?

254
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,498
This isn't school.
You're not getting graded.

255
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,666
- Don't make this into a big thing.
- Don't go.

256
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,171
- Man, she's not shipping off to'Nam.
- You so need to shut up now.

257
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,715
Dean, it's a picnic. It's lunch.

258
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,592
- We'll sit, we'll eat, it's over.
- No.

259
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,304
- What do you think is gonna happen?
- I think I'd like to hear this one also.

260
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,597
I don't want you to go.

261
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,807
- Dean...
- Fine, forget it. Go.

262
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,604
Please don't walk away like that.

263
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,899
Sorry, I'd do a silly walk, but I'm not
feeling very John Cleese now.

264
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:57,903
This isn't my fault. I didn't ask him
to do that. I didn't tell him to do that.

265
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,989
You're my boyfriend.
I would never do anything to hurt you.

266
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,367
Yeah? You're doing it right now.

267
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,580
Going once, going twice...

268
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,042
sold for $25!

269
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,461
Congratulations. Thank you.

270
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,882
Lord, will you look at this?

271
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:22,010
Ladies and gentlemen,
now this is a basket.

272
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,430
Let's start the bidding
on this delicious treat at $10.

273
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,349
- Do I hear $10?
- $10.

274
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,767
$15.

275
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,769
- I have $15.
- $20.

276
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,773
- $20. I have $20. Is that my final offer?
- All right, fine. $25.

277
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,526
Kirk, you just offered $20.
You upped your own bid.

278
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,736
Can we stop the bidding for just a second?

279
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,530
- Sookie, you know the rules.
- Yes, but...

280
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,950
We have $25. Do I hear $30?

281
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,452
- Jackson.
- $30, if there's pie.

282
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,289
- There are no contingencies, Andrew.
- $35.

283
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,582
- Andrew?
- Jackson?

284
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,750
I'm not going higher
without the promise of pie.

285
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,337
I have $35 going once, $35 going twice.

286
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,924
- Sold to Kirk for $35.
- Yes. Finally.

287
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,261
If it hadn't been for me,
I could have had it for $25.

288
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,514
What is wrong with you?
I gave you all the signs.

289
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:11,185
The pointing, the waving, the mouthing,
'That's my basket. '

290
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,770
- Didn't you see the mouthing?
- I saw the mouthing.

291
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:17,191
- Why didn't you bid?
- I don't know. It just didn't feel right.

292
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,483
What are you talking about?

293
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,445
I made four kinds of pesto
and three different desserts.

294
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,948
Plus, the entire basket is an edible pretzel
with a goat-cheese filling.

295
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,326
- I hope Kirk enjoys it.
- I don't understand.

296
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,161
- Come on, Sookie.
- What?

297
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,164
I told you the lease was up
on my apartment, and I asked you...

298
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,209
if you thought I should renew the lease,
and you said yes.

299
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,585
Do you not like that apartment?

300
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,881
No, I love that apartment. It's perfect.
The ultimate bachelor pad.

301
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,175
It's just big enough for one.

302
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,345
Only, here's the thing.
We've been dating for a while...

303
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,514
and I thought
things were going pretty well.

304
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,932
Things are going really well.

305
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,602
So I had this crazy thought
that since things were going really well...

306
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,230
that maybe it was time
to take a step forward.

307
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,689
You wanted to move in together?

308
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,943
I at least wanted to consider
moving in together.

309
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,696
I hadn't even thought about it.

310
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,032
- You hadn't?
- Well, no.

311
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,203
My mistake then. I thought
we were on the same wavelength.

312
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,039
We weren't. No problem. Enjoy your lunch.

313
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:18,836
Jackson, I lied.
I have thought about it. A lot.

314
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,964
Our bathroom's gonna be pink. I'm sorry.

315
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,007
Why didn't you say something?

316
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,511
I didn't want to ruin anything.
We're doing so well.

317
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,138
We have so much fun. It's all working.

318
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,391
Why would living together
mess all that up?

319
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,768
I don't know.
We'd see each other every day.

320
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,603
We see each other every day now.

321
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,189
And you'd find out all
my annoying little quirks.

322
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,067
- I've got annoying quirks, too, you know.
- I know.

323
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,903
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You might get sick of me.

324
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,739
- Or you might get sick of me.
- No, that's not gonna happen.

325
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,076
If that's not gonna happen,
then what's the problem?

326
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,747
The problem is that Kirk
is gonna eat my goat-cheese basket.

327
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,542
Not if I have anything to say about it.

328
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:03,213
$12. Do I hear any more?
Can we get any higher than $12?

329
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,382
How's that for not getting sick of you?

330
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,552
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a basket to get.

331
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,888
Next up, what?

332
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,974
That looks like
a Doose's Market basket. Nice?

333
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,267
That's mine.

334
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,353
- I'd like to start the bidding at $5.
- I bid $5.

335
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,980
- That was quick.
- $10.

336
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,774
All that's in there is two stale Pop-Tarts
and a Slim Jim.

337
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,651
- $15.
- He looks familiar.

338
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,445
- $20.
- So does he.

339
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,947
- $25.
- This is going very well.

340
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,490
- Oh, no.
- $30.

341
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,453
- Those are the guys, aren't they?
- Excuse me?

342
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,706
The guys whose pictures you sent me.
You brought them here.

343
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,375
Darling, you can't be trusted
to do it yourself.

344
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,585
Jeez.

345
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,838
- $35.
- That one's a snorkeler.

346
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,174
$35, now we're back on track. Keep it up.

347
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,264
Luke. Where is he? I need him, Caesar.
Thank God!

348
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,642
- You gotta come with me.
- What are you doing?

349
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,228
- I got plates here.
- Caesar, you're in charge.

350
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,439
Do you have money? I need it.
Which one opens this thing? That one?

351
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,650
- Stop messing with that.
- You gotta come with me.

352
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,277
Patty gave my picture out
'cause she thinks I need a man.

353
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,738
You need one with a couch
and a knowledge of Freud.

354
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,907
You have to come out
and bid on my basket.

355
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,951
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

356
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:18,205
I have never in my life taken part
in one of these crazy group flip-outs...

357
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,915
and I'm not about to start now.

358
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,668
- But, right now, out there...
- Just buy your own basket.

359
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,003
- I cannot buy my own basket.
- Why not?

360
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,630
Because that is pathetic.

361
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,758
And chasing me around my diner,
begging me to buy your basket?

362
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,677
Also pathetic, but that I can live with...

363
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,929
where that pathetic
is truly pathetic-pathetic...

364
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,224
and only you can save me
from the double pathetic. Please.

365
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,561
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Hurry up.

366
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,484
- $45.50.
- $46.

367
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,152
- $46.50.
- $47.

368
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,864
- Go on.
- $47, are you kidding?

369
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,448
- Luke.
- $47.50.

370
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,659
For two stale Pop-Tarts and a Slim Jim?

371
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,911
You're not getting the whole
saving me thing.

372
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:01,373
- Fine. $48.
- $48.50.

373
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,001
- $49.
- $49.50.

374
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,712
$52.50.

375
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,214
What? We're just supposed to go to $50.

376
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,091
- I have a life.
- $52.50. Going once.

377
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,718
That's my job.

378
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:16,889
- $52.50 going once, $52.50 going twice.
- Please, God.

379
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,391
- Sold for $52.50.
- Yes!

380
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,854
Sorry, don't feel bad. I'm totally into
Dungeons & Dragons. You've skated.

381
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:27,149
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
concludes the basket bidding.

382
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:31,904
Victors, come claim your prizes
and your dates. Let the lunching begin!

383
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,491
- You rock.
- Thank you.

384
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,701
- Welcome.
- What do we do now?

385
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:38,994
- I guess we eat.
- This?

386
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,954
- Yeah.
- I have to buy and eat it?

387
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,290
The basket of botulism
does come with my company.

388
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,209
You don't eat with your mouth open,
do you?

389
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,920
Women don't eat. We look at food
and jump on the treadmill.

390
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,004
All right, let's go.

391
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:53,133
- You know, there's nothing there.
- Yes, I know.

392
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,637
- You going after him?
- Not right now.

393
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,514
So, then, shall we?

394
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,935
Fine. Come on.

395
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,900
- Yeah, I think so.
- I can't wait to eat.

396
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,404
- Kirk, I've been looking all over for you.
- Any idea what this is?

397
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,282
Yeah, it's a pineapple-cranberry chutney.

398
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,619
Listen, I'd like to talk to you
about this basket.

399
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,872
As you know, Sookie made it,
and since we are seeing each other...

400
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:26,375
naturally, she assumed
that I would bid on it.

401
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,419
Where are the carrot sticks?
Every lunch has carrot sticks.

402
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,422
But, see, I was a little upset
about a fight we had...

403
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,258
and so I didn't bid on the basket.

404
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,052
I love carrot sticks.
Especially the crinkle-cut kind.

405
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,889
However, we just made up,
and now I'd like to have lunch with Sookie.

406
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,683
So...

407
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,811
I need the basket.

408
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,646
This is my basket.

409
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,691
I'd like you to give it to me,
so I can have lunch with Sookie.

410
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:54,820
I bought it. The rules are, whoever
bids the highest gets the basket.

411
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,446
Yes, I understand the rules, but...

412
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,782
I bid the highest,
I bought the basket, I get it.

413
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:02,995
Okay, Kirk, I'll pay you for it.
I'll give you $45.

414
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,873
- That's $10 more than you paid for it.
- No.

415
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,750
- Okay. $50.
- No.

416
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,379
Kirk, this is insane!
I'll buy you another basket.

417
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,298
I don't need you to buy me another basket.

418
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,342
I won this one. You can't just come by
and take it away.

419
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:20,345
Just because you have a girlfriend
who made a basket for you...

420
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:23,724
doesn't give you the right
to bully those who don't have girlfriends...

421
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,393
- to make them a basket.
- I wasn't trying to bully you.

422
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,937
Not this year, not last year,
not the year before that.

423
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,357
- My mother didn't even make one for me.
- That's very sad.

424
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,818
She made one for my brothers
and sisters, but not me.

425
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,821
- That's terrible, Kirk.
- Twelve brothers and sisters.

426
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,282
The only one without a basket, me.

427
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,493
Okay, Kirk, what's it gonna take?

428
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,995
- $250.
- You're kidding me!

429
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,123
- Twelve brothers and sisters.
- Will you take a check?

430
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,000
With two forms of ID.

431
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,670
I swear, you'd better be as pathetic
as you sound.

432
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,047
Trust me.

433
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,675
- What time is it?
- 3:00.

434
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,094
I don't understand.
Henry should have called by now.

435
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:04,056
- Give me some change.
- There.

436
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:10,229
- Oh, my God! It's not working.
- Great.

437
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,981
- Can I have his lunch now?
- I'll be right back.

438
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,900
We're supposed to be eating
on the ground.

439
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:15,943
Says who?

440
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,904
Every picture of a picnic
shows people eating on the ground.

441
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,241
Every time I have seen a picture
of people eating on the ground...

442
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:25,369
I've thought,'What the hell
are you doing sitting on the ground?'

443
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,663
Spring for some beach chairs,
you cheapskates.

444
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,083
- Lorelai, do you have your cell phone?
- Yeah, is everything okay?

445
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,584
- I just need to make a call.
- Here.

446
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,419
I'll be right back!

447
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,380
Where are you going?

448
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,591
I am going to the diner, I am going
to get us some edible food...

449
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,885
and I'm gonna bring it back here
for us to eat.

450
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,805
That is so not the point of today.
I made this. I am insulted.

451
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,349
- I will now proceed to pout.
- I'll bring back brownies.

452
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,852
The pouting has left the building.

453
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,115
- Hello?
- Hello, Henry?

454
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,243
- I've been trying to call you.
- I know. The pay phone is broken.

455
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,579
I thought the number was wrong, so I...

456
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,206
- What? You what?
- I called your house...

457
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,250
- and your mother answered.
- What did you say?

458
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,294
I asked for you, and then she asked why.

459
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,504
I said because. She said because why?

460
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:21,466
I got nervous and tried to sell her
a subscription to The Wall Street Journal.

461
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,968
Were you successful?

462
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,095
- Lane.
- Sorry. But she doesn't know, right?

463
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,598
- I guess not.
- Then we're still good.

464
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,766
- Can you meet me now?
- I don't know.

465
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,769
It's later than we planned,
but we still have a little time...

466
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,980
- and I saved your lunch from David.
- David?

467
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,107
- My cousin. The decoy.
- Right.

468
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,903
We'll rendezvous where I told you.
Drive by, honk twice, go around the block.

469
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,821
The second time you pass, I'll jump in.

470
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,908
- Do you want me to slow down?
- Yeah, of course.

471
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,786
- Not to a total stop, but...
- Lane, I don't think this is gonna work.

472
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,914
- What?
- This. You, me.

473
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,499
Are you breaking up with me?

474
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,417
How can I? I've never been out with you.

475
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,045
Yeah, but that's what today
was supposed to be. A date.

476
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:01,006
A date where we need a secret plan
and a two-honk drive-by...

477
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,383
- and a decoy cousin?
- Well, yeah.

478
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,637
Lane, I like you, but I want to be able
to pick you up...

479
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,098
stop the car, and take you out.
And I want to be able to call you.

480
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,183
At your house.

481
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,101
I'm gonna tell my mother. I promise.

482
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,020
- When?
- Soon.

483
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:19,483
Yeah. Look, I've got prom coming up...

484
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:22,611
and my friends and I
are gonna rent a limo to take us there...

485
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,030
and I want to go,
and I want to take a date.

486
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,033
I'm sure I can figure something out.
Maybe Rory can...

487
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,952
I asked somebody else.

488
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:36,250
I'm sorry, I just figured
you'd never be able to go and...

489
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,127
It's okay. You should've asked
someone else.

490
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,671
I do like you, Lane.

491
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:43,799
Okay, well, thank you. I appreciate that.

492
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,592
- I have to go.
- Lane.

493
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,476
David came by here 15 minutes ago!
Said you ran off somewhere.

494
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,811
- Where did you run?
- Nowhere.

495
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,021
Who is he? The boy you ran off to see?

496
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,441
The one who calls here pretending
to work for The Wall Street Journal.

497
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:04,194
- There's no boy!
- You know the rules. No boys!

498
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,071
Not unless I approve, and I don't!

499
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:07,990
- How do you know?
- I know!

500
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,034
You're sneaking, you're lying.
Something's wrong with this boy.

501
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,454
There's nothing wrong!
He's perfect and he likes me...

502
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,248
and I was so afraid to tell you that...

503
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,001
that he's taking somebody else
to the prom! And I blew it.

504
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,545
- You go upstairs and calm down!
- Fine!

505
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,005
- Now!
- Fine!

506
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,550
That is not calming down!

507
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,720
- Where do you want to eat?
- Don't care.

508
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:30,888
Okay.

509
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:34,224
- Where are you going?
- Thought you didn't care.

510
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,226
I'm not jumping in the lake.

511
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,562
No underwater dining. Got it.

512
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,819
- Now what?
- Now we sit.

513
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,279
- Here?
- Yep.

514
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,407
On the bridge?
That's where we're going to eat?

515
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,702
- Okay.
- I like this place.

516
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,581
Wow, a place in Stars Hollow
you actually like. I'm stunned.

517
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,374
It's got some good memories.

518
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,084
- See right over there?
- Yep.

519
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:03,462
That's where Luke pushed me in.

520
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:04,922
- That's nice.
- It is.

521
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,465
- So why'd you do it?
- Do what?

522
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,884
- Outbid Dean like that.
- I don't know.

523
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,596
I guess it started as a joke just to bug him,
but then he just got so mad...

524
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:15,307
and he's so tall, and I just was...

525
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:20,103
looking at him and he's standing there
all tall and mad, and I don't know...

526
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,397
- it was really funny.
- It wasn't funny.

527
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:26,443
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I didn't intend to do it.

528
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,113
Does that make you feel any better?

529
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,282
I just don't want to be in a fight with Dean.

530
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:35,452
I'm sorry about that.
You want to push me in the lake?

531
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:38,455
- It's cathartic, I hear.
- Maybe in a little bit.

532
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:39,790
Whenever.

533
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:42,876
- So when do we open this thing?
- Go ahead.

534
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:49,758
Wow, not one thing in here
that I would remotely consider eating.

535
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,719
I didn't make it for you. I made it for Dean.

536
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:56,849
- And Dean would have eaten this?
- Yes, he would have.

537
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:08,193
- Dean is an idiot.
- Dean never would have fallen for that.

538
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,824
I can't believe
he wouldn't take your check.

539
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,951
Well, apparently,
I don't look like my picture.

540
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:18,328
- He's a loon.
- Yeah. It's okay.

541
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm paying him off in weekly installments
in crinkle-cut carrot sticks.

542
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,835
- I'm glad we made up.
- Yeah, me, too.

543
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,840
And, you know, if you still wanted
to talk about, you know...

544
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:33,218
what we were talking about,
we could talk about it now.

545
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,805
- No.
- Excuse me?

546
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:40,309
- I don't know. I'm having second thoughts.
- You are?

547
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:43,020
Yeah, I mean, living together,
big deal, right?

548
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:47,399
Oh, right. Big deal. Who cares?

549
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,861
Not me. No sirree Bob.

550
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:56,700
So, I'm sorry, you don't think
we should live together anymore?

551
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,535
- Nope.
- Okay.

552
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,996
I think we should get married.

553
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,414
What?

554
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:06,126
I think we should get married.

555
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:09,546
- But...
- Soon.

556
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,216
- Are you pregnant?
- What do you say?

557
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,388
- Sookie?
- Yes!

558
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:22,935
I say yes! Oh, my God,
we're getting married!

559
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,525
You do know that this means
we'll have to live together?

560
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,860
- Yes, I do.
- Okay, good.

561
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,909
You know your burgers
actually taste better outside?

562
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,453
Good, the next time the roof
in the diner's leaking...

563
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:44,039
I'll just rip the stupid thing off.

564
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:47,584
This is nice, huh? Come on. Admit it.

565
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:48,710
- Never.
- What?

566
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:51,672
You'd much rather be sitting
out here than inside working.

567
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:54,424
- Diner's probably on fire by now.
- You are stubborn.

568
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,385
- I'm stubborn?
- Yeah, you're stubborn.

569
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,928
From Miss Flexibility over here?

570
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,305
- I can be flexible.
- Please.

571
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,766
As long as everything
is exactly the way I want it...

572
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,935
- I'm totally flexible.
- My mistake.

573
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,019
Do you want a fry?

574
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,479
- You want a carrot?
- Impossible.

575
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,231
Right back at you.

576
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,068
- So let me ask you something.
- Napkin, please.

577
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:16,238
- Who did you want to get your basket?
- What?

578
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,699
Before you knew
Patty put you on the dating game...

579
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,451
you did pack this disgusting lunch
and bring it out here.

580
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,078
So who did you want to get it?

581
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:26,123
Well, last year, Roy Wilkins bought it...

582
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:29,209
and I got my sprinklers fixed for half price.

583
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,795
And this year my rain gutters
are completely clogged...

584
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:34,339
and I thought if I could get
the Collins kid to bite...

585
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,133
- I'd get that taken care of.
- Practical.

586
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,635
- I thought so.
- So the participation in this thing...

587
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:41,388
- was for home improvement reasons?
- Yes.

588
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,308
And I don't know, it's a nice concept.

589
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:46,101
What is?

590
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:51,106
Just having someone who you love,
or have some kind of crazy crush on...

591
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:55,736
bid on your basket and then share
a romantic lunch. It's a nice concept.

592
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:58,030
Well, I'm sure someday you'll manage...

593
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:01,033
to find the right guy
and drag him out to this thing...

594
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:04,453
make him buy your stupid basket,
then you'll be sitting here with him.

595
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,205
Yeah. Someday.

596
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,919
- You know what?
- What?

597
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,338
This is nice.

598
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:16,882
I have to talk to you.

599
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,886
- Yeah, okay. I'll be right back.
- I'll be right here.

600
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,354
- How are you doing?
- I'm not great.

601
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,023
Dean, it's just a silly town thing.

602
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:37,027
I've been telling myself that,
and I tried to forget about it, but I can't.

603
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,111
I'm worried about Rory.

604
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:40,030
She shouldn't be hanging out
with this guy.

605
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:42,783
- Today was kind of...
- It's got nothing to do with today.

606
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,786
Yes, it has a little to do with today,
but it's more than that.

607
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,413
Ever since I met him,
I had this feeling he was bad news.

608
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:52,125
- Jess has a few issues.
- One issue is that he's a complete jerk.

609
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:54,253
He's always getting in fights at school...

610
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:57,548
that is, when he bothers to show up at all,
and he just...

611
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,341
I don't know. Now this thing with Rory.

612
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,885
- It's like he's always around.
- You sound jealous.

613
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:05,931
I'm not jealous. He just...
She has to be nice to everyone, you know?

614
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,558
I know, but, hon, that's Rory.

615
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:11,311
He's gonna get her into trouble.
I can feel it. I just know it.

616
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:14,189
He doesn't care about her.
He's using her to drive me crazy.

617
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:16,358
- Dean, you love Rory, right?
- Yeah.

618
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,027
So part of love is trust.
You have to trust her.

619
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,405
- I do trust her. It's...
- Him. I know.

620
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:24,283
But flying off the handle
is not gonna get you what you want.

621
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:27,619
She cares about you, she's not going to do
anything to mess things up.

622
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:30,122
- I know this.
- I hope you're right.

623
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,212
- Ten.
- Ten?

624
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:41,675
But I didn't understand a word of it.
So I had to reread it when I was 15.

625
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,468
I've yet to make it through it.

626
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:45,804
Really? Try it. The Fountainhead is classic.

627
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:48,098
But Ayn Rand is a political nut.

628
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,934
Nobody could write a 40-page monologue
the way she could.

629
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:53,979
Okay, tomorrow I will try again,
and you will...

630
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,524
Give the painful Ernest Hemingway
another chance. Yes, I promise.

631
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:01,153
You know, Ernest only has lovely things
to say about you.

632
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:04,406
- Why are you only nice to me?
- Excuse me?

633
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,619
An hour ago you were screwing with Dean,
and now you're nice to me.

634
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,871
You see, it's the screwing with Dean...

635
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:14,750
that's an important step to getting here,
so that I could be nice to you.

636
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,169
- So it was a plan?
- What?

637
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,339
The whole bidding on my basket.
It was a plan.

638
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,549
Okay, I'm officially starving.

639
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,219
- And officially evasive.
- Come on. I'll get you a pizza.

640
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,221
- Answer my question.
- Do you like pepperoni?

641
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:30,641
- You're not going to, are you?
- We could just get it on half.

642
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,894
- Okay. I give. Let's go.
- If you insist.

643
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,835
Where have you been?
I thought Taylor auctioned you off.

644
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:01,839
No, I just went to get some pizza,
and I wandered around the bookstore.

645
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,882
- Here.
- What's this?

646
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,718
- You wanted to read The Children's Hour.
- I did? When?

647
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:09,888
When we were watching Julia,
and Jane Fonda was Lillian Hellman.

648
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:12,391
Yeah, and I made
the Hellmann's mayonnaise joke.

649
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,810
- Which no one ever needs to hear again.
- Right.

650
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,104
- Well, thanks.
- You're welcome.

651
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,481
- So who where you with?
- What?

652
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:21,358
Pizza, book-buying.
Did you have company?

653
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,068
- Yeah.
- Who?

654
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:25,737
- Jess.
- Jess?

655
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,239
- Yeah.
- Right.

656
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:30,909
- So I'll be in my room.
- Okay. Good.

657
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:41,545
- So how was the picnic?
- Fine.

658
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,797
Good. Did you get
the Dean issue resolved?

659
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:47,593
Not yet. He's coming over and we're gonna
smooth things over, hopefully.

660
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:50,929
Yeah, well, smoothing's good.
I love the smoothing.

661
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:53,182
So how is it with Jess?

662
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:55,058
- Fine.
- Obviously.

663
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,229
With the pizza and the books...
So good. I'm glad.

664
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,273
- What?
- What what?

665
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,108
You look like you have something to say.

666
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,444
I have nothing to say.
I never have anything to say.

667
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,947
- Yes, that is your reputation.
- It's... I don't know.

668
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:11,700
I'm surprised that you're
hanging out with him.

669
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:12,826
Why?

670
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,954
- He just doesn't seem like the nicest kid.
- You don't know him.

671
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,498
No, I guess not.

672
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,791
You're judging him
by that one time he came here.

673
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:22,127
Which, by the way,
was not a rousing success.

674
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,880
He had just moved here.
He was mad at his mom.

675
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:27,716
Trust me, he's got a really good side
to him. You'll see it.

676
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,384
- Good, I can't wait.
- Mom.

677
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,303
I'm sorry, I just...

678
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:35,766
I don't know, from the things I've seen,
and the things I hear...

679
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:36,934
Like what things?

680
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:40,812
The vandalism. The stealing.
The cutting school. The fighting.

681
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,774
- How do you know about the fighting?
- Well, Dean told me.

682
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,275
- Dean?
- Yes.

683
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:48,403
- You've been discussing this with Dean?
- He discussed it with me.

684
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:51,365
- When?
- Today. He's really upset about this.

685
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:52,950
So he went running to my mother?

686
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,244
- He needed to talk.
- He could've talked to me.

687
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,955
- He couldn't. You were with Jess.
- You're taking his side?

688
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,415
I'm not taking sides. I'm Swiss, babe.

689
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:04,670
- I wasn't off with Jess. Jess outbid him.
- I know.

690
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:08,298
The rule is that if one person
outbids someone else, then...

691
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,967
Rory, this is not about the rule.

692
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,554
This is about Dean being concerned
that you're hanging out with someone...

693
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,597
- who could get you hurt.
- How could he?

694
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:19,059
In the short time he's been here,
he's managed to make a lot of enemies.

695
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,854
- When did I move to Salem?
- People are concerned about you.

696
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:25,691
You're young and naive and you think
that everyone has some good inside...

697
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:29,027
- if you give them a chance.
- So you're saying that Jess is no good.

698
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:32,739
I've known guys like Jess. He seems cool
because he's got a dangerous vibe...

699
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:34,783
and this problem with authority...

700
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:37,077
and he's seen
a lot of Sylvester Stallone movies.

701
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,413
- Oh, my God.
- But guys like this get into trouble.

702
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:43,000
Which, if you hang out with him,
gets you into trouble. I don't want that.

703
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:46,628
I'm sorry, are we talking about Dean still,
or are we talking about you?

704
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,506
- I've been there, okay? You haven't.
- Been where?

705
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:51,967
We got pizza. We looked at some books.

706
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,511
God, I can't even believe
I'm having this conversation.

707
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:58,473
With you, of all people. I don't even
want to talk about this anymore.

708
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:00,809
- Rory!
- No, I'm going for a walk.

709
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:05,480
- Dean is gonna be here any minute.
- He probably wants to talk to you anyhow.

710
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,528
A cigar club?

711
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,907
Can you imagine
a more disgusting organization to join?

712
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,825
Your grandfather now pays money...

713
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:19,161
to sit in an enclosed room
with a bunch of men...

714
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,038
and blow smoke in each other's faces.

715
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,458
Twice a week he comes home
smelling like a flophouse.

716
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,089
So I finally just confronted him.

717
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:34,968
I said, 'Richard, I know you're going
through a transitional period here...

718
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:37,137
'and I encourage your trying out
new things...

719
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:40,599
'but this seems
completely out of character for you. '

720
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:45,395
- I'm sorry, am I boring you?
- No, you're not.

721
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:46,980
Sorry, Grandma.

722
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:50,067
- So how are things at the Inn?
- Fine. The same.

723
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:54,196
- And, Rory, how's that boyfriend of yours?
- Apparently very chatty.

724
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,406
That's nice.

725
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:59,284
Lorelai, anything new with you?

726
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:03,121
No, nothing. It's been pretty quiet
around the house lately.

727
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,833
Well, sometimes quiet could be nice.

728
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,210
Soothing.

729
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,255
You can hear yourself think.

730
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:15,342
All right, what's going on with you two?

731
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,010
- Nothing.
- It's not nothing.

732
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:20,722
You've been both sitting here, not saying
a word, not looking at each other.

733
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,140
- Are you in a fight?
- I'm not.

734
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,767
- Please.
- Please, what?

735
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:28,272
- You have been freezing me out all week.
- I haven't had anything to say.

736
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,650
- Who is it?
- No one.

737
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,861
- Why won't you tell me?
- 'Cause it's no one.

738
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:35,904
- Is it Jess?
- You're kidding, right?

739
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:37,865
- Jess? Who's Jess?
- I'm not kidding.

740
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:41,660
- Why would you assume that it's Jess?
- Why won't you tell me who it is?

741
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:43,495
- Who's Jess?
- Luke's nephew.

742
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:45,247
It's not Jess. It's Dean.

743
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,042
You want to read it? Wait, no, Dean
will probably tell you all about it later.

744
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:50,127
That's not funny.

745
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,671
- All week you've been...
- We're not gonna get into this.

746
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:56,592
Getting into what? Is it about this Jess,
the thing you're not getting into?

747
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:59,595
- You never liked Dean at the beginning.
- I didn't know him.

748
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,556
- And now you don't like Jess?
- That's because I know him.

749
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,641
Are you dating Jess?
What happened to Dean?

750
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,519
- I'm not dating Jess.
- But he's trying to weasel his way in.

751
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:09,688
- He's not trying to weasel his way.
- In where?

752
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,816
In Rory's world.
He has his eye on her, and he's trouble.

753
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:15,360
- He's not trouble.
- Yes, he is.

754
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:20,115
If your mother thinks he isn't appropriate
company, then you need to listen to her.

755
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,658
There. Thank you, Mom.

756
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,953
Excuse me, but I don't feel very hungry
right now.

757
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,858
Kim's Antiques.
We're closed. Call tomorrow.

758
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,902
- Mrs. Kim, it's Rory.
- It's after 9:00.

759
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,612
- I know.
- Lane can't talk after 9:00.

760
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:02,908
I promise to never again call after 9:00,
but can I please talk to her now?

761
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,284
Just this once?

762
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,871
- Okay. Just this once.
- Thank you.

763
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,669
- Lane?
- What?

764
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:14,711
Phone.

765
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,922
- But it's after 9:00.
- It's okay, it's Rory.

766
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:19,049
I don't want to talk right now.

767
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:22,553
Rory, Lane's not feeling well.
She needs to call you tomorrow.

768
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:26,181
- Okay, thanks anyhow.
- Yes. Goodbye.

769
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,404
- It's early for you to be in bed.
- I'm tired.

770
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:44,032
- Come downstairs and have some tea.
- No, thank you.

771
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,952
I know you're upset,
but I have these rules for a reason.

772
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:49,037
I'm your mother.
I know what's best for you.

773
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,873
Can we talk about this tomorrow, please?

774
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:55,002
This is exactly why I make these rules.
You're too young, too vulnerable.

775
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:58,255
American boys have different values.
They don't understand respect.

776
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:02,092
You get hurt. I do all of this so you
don't get hurt, and now you are hurt.

777
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:05,596
I don't like this at all. Who is he?
This boy who hurt you?

778
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,139
Henry Cho.

779
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,266
Cho sounds Korean.

780
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:10,684
- It is Korean.
- He was Korean?

781
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:14,021
Yes, and he was smart
and wonderful and cute...

782
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,815
- And you're sure he was Korean?
- He's gonna be a doctor.

783
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:20,110
He goes to church.
He's a counselor at Bible camp.

784
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:22,738
- And he liked me.
- A doctor!

785
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:26,241
I'm so stupid.
I should have just told you and I didn't.

786
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:29,161
Now he's gone, and I'm just stupid.

787
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:33,373
- Maybe I can call his mother.
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.

788
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,380
You're sure he was Korean?

789
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:44,301
I swear, Mom, there's just something
about that kid that...

790
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:48,222
I don't know, I hate it because he's
Luke's nephew, and Rory likes him, but...

791
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:49,723
You are her mother, Lorelai.

792
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,518
You must set boundaries
and restrictions. It's your job.

793
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:55,479
I wanted to like him, but I couldn't,
and Rory can't see it.

794
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,605
Well, she's young.

795
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,649
- She won't take my word for it.
- She's young.

796
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,859
I don't know what to do.
Maybe I'm overreacting.

797
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:04,321
Lorelei, listen to me.
Now, I don't say this to you very often...

798
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:07,658
but on this matter,
I happen to agree with you 100%.

799
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:13,080
- Gee. Thanks, Mom.
- I know Rory's a good girl...

800
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:17,084
but good girls can go bad with
the wrong influences. We all know that.

801
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,837
No, I don't think Rory's
actually gonna go bad.

802
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,505
Don't back down, Lorelai.

803
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,341
You took a stand, and you are completely
in the right here.

804
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:26,927
You absolutely must keep her
from that boy.

805
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,514
If you need to change her curfew,
lock her up, throw away the key...

806
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,517
whatever it takes to ensure
she doesn't go astray, you do it.

807
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:37,187
Her judgment cannot be trusted here.
She's a young girl and knows nothing.

808
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:41,233
You are her eyes and her ears
and her brain, for as long as it takes...

809
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:45,112
to make sure she doesn't make
ridiculous choices in her life.

810
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:46,864
Yeah.

811
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,409
Would you excuse me for a sec?

812
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,461
- Can I come in?
- It's not my house. I can't stop you.

813
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,381
Just listen to me for one second, okay?

814
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:08,135
- No sighing. Just let me talk.
- Go ahead.

815
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:15,309
I don't want to lock you up
and throw away the key.

816
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:16,768
Well, good.

817
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,938
Your judgment means something,
especially to me.

818
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,774
I can't be your eyes and your ears
and your brain.

819
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:25,068
I'm trying really hard
to connect the dots here.

820
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,570
I got spooked.

821
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,698
It violates the fabulous 'cool-mom'
clause we're supposed to have.

822
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,284
- But I did, and I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

823
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,995
Now, I am concerned about Jess.

824
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,747
- You shouldn't be.
- But I am.

825
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,042
However, you are a smart girl,
a good judge of character...

826
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:44,046
and the fact that he seems to like you
gives him a couple of brownie points.

827
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:47,716
You're not a little kid.
I don't think you ever were a little kid.

828
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,760
I was, for about a month.

829
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,680
If you think he's a decent guy,
I have to respect your judgment.

830
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:55,098
Thank you.

831
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:58,227
- But I'm asking you to be careful.
- I will.

832
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,187
- Really careful.
- I will.

833
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,398
- Boy-in-the-plastic-bubble kind of careful.
- I promise.

834
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:06,985
You have to cut Dean some slack.
He's so crazy about you.

835
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,613
He didn't mean anything
by coming to me, he just wigged.

836
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:10,906
I know.

837
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:14,827
- Is our fight over?
- Fight over.

838
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,286
Good.

839
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:25,003
- You still don't look okay.
- My mother agreed with me tonight.

840
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:28,006
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

841
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:35,013
- I need a shower.
- Don't be so dramatic.

842
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:38,350
- 'I agree with you 100%.'
- Go upstairs.

843
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:41,436
- Find a movie. I'll be down in a minute.
- Okay.

844
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,148
'I agree with you 100%.'
I may have to shave my head also!

845
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:05,627
- Hello?
- Hi.

846
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:08,005
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

847
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,757
- Nothing. You?
- Nothing.

848
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:12,176
Why'd you call?

849
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:15,345
- I wanted to...
- I'm glad you called.

850
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,722
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

851
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:17,806
Why?

852
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,226
'Cause maybe you could explain
what this crazy woman is talking about.

853
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,562
- The Fountainhead.
- Yes.

854
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:27,941
- Your fault. And you will pay.
- I promise, commit to it one more time...

855
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:30,903
and if it still is awful for you,
I will make it up to you.

856
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:33,197
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

857
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:36,783
Okay. I'm gonna hold you to that.

858
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:17,407
English
