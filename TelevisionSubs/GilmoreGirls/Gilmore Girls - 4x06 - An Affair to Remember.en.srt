1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:04,211
- It's simply disgraceful. 
- For years, we've had peace in the neighborhood.

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:05,813
I knew the Richmonds were going to be trouble

3
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:07,271
when they missed the block party last month.

4
00:00:07,856 --> 00:00:11,548
I don't understand. They gave out full-size candy bars for Halloween. So what?

5
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:15,009
Not full-size candy bars, Lorelai - king-size candy bars.

6
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:17,765
We've been giving out full-size candy bars for years now.

7
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,707
And then those people move in and throw the entire balance of the neighborhood off.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,986
- They made everybody look ridiculous. 
- It's very embarrassing.

9
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:24,374
I think we have to do something about this -

10
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:26,073
maybe go to the homeowners association.

11
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:28,874
Two Halloweens ago, someone painted the Duprees' Chihuahua orange

12
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:31,306
and nobody went to the homeowners association then.

13
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:34,413
- Well, everybody hated Taco. 
- I think you're making a little too much of this.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,993
I saw Mae Richmond at Bay Wellington's two weeks before Halloween.

15
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:40,880
She had ample time to bring it up then, and nothing - not a word.

16
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:43,390
I think it might be time to go after their ball machine.

17
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:45,008
Their ball machine?

18
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:47,059
They have a ball machine on their tennis court

19
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:50,077
that is extraordinarily loud and unpredictable.

20
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,083
Flying, thumping balls all over the place.

21
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:54,202
- Flying, thumping what all over the place? 
- Balls.

22
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:58,898
- You are four. 
- And balls are funny.

23
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:02,217
Don't worry, Emily. If the homeowners association doesn't do anything,

24
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:04,504
we'll take this to the neighbors, get a petition going.

25
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,464
Or if that doesn't work, you could throw some hoods on

26
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:09,834
and burn a full-size Mars bar on their front lawn.

27
00:01:09,932 --> 00:01:11,738
King-size, Lorelai - king-size.

28
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,454
So, how's work, Grandpa?

29
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,752
- Look how smoothly she changes the subject. 
- Work is lovely, Rory.

30
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,472
- How's school? 
- Crazy.

31
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,893
- She's taking too many courses. 
- I am not.

32
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,789
- How many are you taking? 
- Five.

33
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:24,427
- Is five a lot? 
- It's not a lot

34
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,306
It is a lot.

35
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:28,102
I took five courses when I was a freshman. Rory takes after me.

36
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,358
- I like to be busy. 
- Idle hands are the devil's playthings.

37
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,103
- That's actually the title of one of her classes. 
- Please don't worry about me.

38
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,895
She says to the mother and the grandmother.

39
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:37,016
Are you done?

40
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,644
Oh, yes, thank you.

41
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,634
Good, because we have mini lemon bundt cakes for dessert.

42
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:43,504
What?

43
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,463
Well, they're serving full-size bundt cakes over at the Richmonds' house.

44
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,183
- She's done. 
- Oh, no, I have a carrot.

45
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,081
She's done.

46
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,170
Bet the Richmonds would have let me eat my carrot.

47
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:58,957
- All right, this should do it. 
- May we please get this over with?

48
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:02,122
- Patience is a virtue, Richard. 
- And time is fleeting, Emily.

49
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,590
You're starting a new partnership. You need new photographs,

50
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:07,299
- especially with that new look. 
- I thought I'd give a beard a try.

51
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:10,165
Well, I like it. All right, Helmut, we're all set here.

52
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:13,284
Okay. Important men doing important things.

53
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:18,365
Good. One more time. We're going to sign, and...

54
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:19,899
We're done.

55
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,905
Thank you, Helmut. That was wonderful.

56
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,220
And now we sign the real papers.

57
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:28,372
- I'm feeling historic. You? 
- Oh, yes.

58
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,435
It's Gettysburg all over again.

59
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:34,716
Thank you.

60
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:37,712
Important men doing important things.

61
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,773
Now that makes it official.

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,719
Jason.

63
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:44,763
- Let's give 'em hell. 
- You bet.

64
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,426
Oh, I should have had Helmut get the handshake.

65
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:48,146
The signing was fine, Emily.

66
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,020
Sorry about the photo session.

67
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:51,981
Oh, no, that's okay. I think it's a cute idea.

68
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:56,229
Yes, and when the financial papers call for an official photo, it'll be downright darling.

69
00:03:56,394 --> 00:04:00,356
I learned long ago, Jason, when it comes to things like this, Emily is always right.

70
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,359
- I am sure she is. 
- Thank you both.

71
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:04,674
Jason, how's your time? Would you like to join us for dinner?

72
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:07,658
Oh, I'd love to, Emily, but I should get these papers up to my lawyer's office.

73
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:09,625
- Next week? 
- Consider it an open invitation.

74
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,397
Thank you. Richard, I'll see you tomorrow morning.

75
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:12,246
Yes, you will.

76
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,637
"I think it's cute."

77
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:19,368
He's young, Emily.

78
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:22,757
Yes, well, a good smack on that scruffy face of his would age him up a bit.

79
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,797
All right, let's discuss the launch party. Do you have any sort of particular feel in mind?

80
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:29,291
Well, I'll leave that to your discretion. Just make sure it's dignified.

81
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:30,959
We probably shouldn't go too fancy.

82
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:35,634
Maybe we'll do one of those vodka bars - caviar, a Russian theme.

83
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:38,337
- I love that it's okay to be Russian again. 
- It sounds lovely.

84
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,115
- How's the 23rd? 
- Perfect.

85
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,622
- And I want you to get a new suit. 
- I don't need a new suit.

86
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:44,457
And find out what Jason's going to wear.

87
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:46,791
I don't want the two of you showing up looking like the Bobbsey twins.

88
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,220
Oh, yes, that would be embarrassing.

89
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,704
I'll need a guest list.

90
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,590
A Russian theme. I like that.

91
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:57,462
The conquering peoples impose their own values

92
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:59,749
on the subjugated peoples through education,

93
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,977
and quite often through the appointment

94
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,144
of a priesthood from among their own ranks.

95
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,857
This means we should not assume that the system of values

96
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:09,504
has in some way evolved in a region.

97
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,868
It is almost always imposed with the explicit purpose

98
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,264
of keeping power in the hands of the powerful.

99
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:19,037
Something to think about until next week, when we will burst more of your illusions...

100
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,994
which brings me to a bit of bad news.

101
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:23,921
There was an error in the syllabus you received.

102
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:27,725
The dates were wrong, which means that all of your reading has been pushed up one week.

103
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:31,863
I apologize for this cruel little life experience, but what can I do?

104
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,162
I just found out my in-laws are moving back to town.

105
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:36,035
None of us are immune.

106
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:37,638
I'll see you all Tuesday.

107
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:45,077
So, we were thinking maybe two horses to start with.

108
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:46,977
See, it's so charming with the overhang here.

109
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:48,718
- You want me to turn this into stables? 
- Yes.

110
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:51,806
- Without a magic wand or some sort of fairy dust? 
- Preferably, yes.

111
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:55,645
- Let me take a look inside. 
- We'd like to keep the existing structure, please.

112
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:58,056
Lorelai, I'm all set up as soon as you're ready.

113
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,449
- Be right there, Kirk. 
- Okie dokie.

114
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,887
- How attached are you gonna get to these horses? 
- What?

115
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:05,449
- You gonna name 'em, feed 'em apples, braid their tails? 
- Why, Tom?

116
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:08,850
The roof's about to cave in so I can stay within our budget,

117
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:10,723
but then I'd just call 'em all Trigger.

118
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,782
Just tell me how much more it's gonna cost. 

119
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:14,671
- Hey, you're here. 
- I'm always here.

120
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:17,569
Listen, I want to talk to you about something very exciting.

121
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:19,290
Very exciting. I love very exciting.

122
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,737
This morning I got a call from your mother.

123
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:24,435
- This is the very exciting? 
- Yes!

124
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:28,071
She doing a launch party for your father's new business and she wants us to do the catering.

125
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:30,339
- Us? 
- Us!

126
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:31,046
- Did you say us? 
- Yes.

127
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,012
- To her. Did you say "us" to her? 
- Yes.

128
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,526
- So she knows about us? 
- Yes, she knows about us, I think.

129
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,948
- What does she know about us? 
- That we have a catering business?

130
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:39,371
- Yes. 
- Oh, man!

131
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:41,173
What? Did I do something bad?

132
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,671
No, nothing, nothing. It's my fault. I forgot to tell her.

133
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:46,145
How could you forget to tell her?

134
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:48,869
Well, I've only seen her forty or fifty times since we started the business.

135
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:51,137
Now what did she say exactly?

136
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,231
She asked me to cater, and I said we'd love to,

137
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:56,134
and then she said, "we?" so I said you and I had started a company,

138
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:58,186
so it'd be the both of us together, and she said fine.

139
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,061
Was there a pause before "fine" or was it just "fine"?

140
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:02,703
- I don't remember. I just remember the "fine." 
- She's mad.

141
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,433
- I swear she didn't sound mad. 
- Okay.

142
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:06,977
- Good. 
- Now let's talk about how much I can't do this.

143
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:09,964
Look, I knew it would be a thing working for your mother, but it's perfect timing.

144
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:12,732
This is probably the last job we'll be able to take before I have the baby.

145
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:15,524
- Something else will come along. 
- Not that pays like your mother does.

146
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:16,876
You know why she pays so much?

147
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:19,169
So she can torture you and you won't throw knives at her.

148
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,485
Look, you already know the house.

149
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:22,947
Decorating, planning - it's gonna be a snap for you.

150
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:26,491
I bet you can spend ninety percent of the evening in the kitchen,

151
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:28,372
then we get to take home the pretty, pretty money.

152
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:29,982
- Sookie. 
- Pretty, pretty money.

153
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:32,235
Aren't you a big fat wad of pretty money?

154
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,328
- Fine. 
- Really?

155
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:37,248
- Shouldn't ask again. 
- Accepting and moving on.

156
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,236
- Excuse me, Lorelai. 
- Oh, my God, Kirk, I forgot you were here.

157
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,205
If I had a nickel for every time I heard that.

158
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:44,431
I'm very, very sorry. You have my full attention.

159
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:49,438
I'm gonna go. We'll talk tomorrow about the details.

160
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:51,871
All right, Kirk, show me what you got.

161
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:54,165
If you'll just follow me, I would like to present you

162
00:07:54,252 --> 00:07:56,688
with my new line of one-of-a-kind mailboxes.

163
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:59,131
Wow. They look very nice, Kirk.

164
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:02,997
And whimsical. They say to the world, "I'll take my mail with a smile."

165
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,256
Yes, they do say that.

166
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:06,647
And since you are one of our preferred customers,

167
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:08,649
with the purchase of one of our mailboxes,

168
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,641
I'll throw in a carved-duck doorstop and a garlic peeler.

169
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:16,042
Wow, that's quite an offer, Kirk, but I think it's a little early for me to pick a mailbox.

170
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:18,065
We haven't even settled on a color for the inn yet.

171
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,846
Well, whimsy goes with everything.

172
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,459
Kirk, I promise, just as soon as...

173
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:25,188
- is that Condoleezza Rice? 
- Yes, it is.

174
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,032
I'm a fan, and her big mouth is perfect for shoving mail in.

175
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:32,620
- I'll have to think about it. 
- Fair enough.

176
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:36,159
So, I hear you're running a catering business now.

177
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:38,218
Oh, yeah, just temporarily.

178
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:40,525
- You guys any good? 
- Not bad.

179
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:45,124
And how much would one have to pay for your culinary services?

180
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:48,083
It depends, the type of food, number of people, kind of venue.

181
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:50,511
Simple food, two guests, my mother's living room.

182
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:51,172
Really?

183
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:53,095
I have a visitor coming in from out of town

184
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:55,600
and I thought it would be nice to serve her a catered meal.

185
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,261
Her?

186
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:58,805
Actually, she was my brother's ex-girlfriend - Lulu.

187
00:08:58,907 --> 00:08:59,707
Good name.

188
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,345
I had sort of a crush on her for a while, and she's coming home to visit her mother,

189
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:05,721
- and she called me. 
- Kirk, you have a date.

190
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,132
- No, just an appointment to take Lulu to dinner. 
- That's a date.

191
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:12,881
I don't have high hopes for it, if that's what you're thinking.

192
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,462
Kirk, it's very sweet,

193
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:17,417
but are you sure you want to have dinner in your living room?

194
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,941
Well, the breakfast nook doesn't seem festive enough.

195
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:22,776
Right, but while you're having dinner in your living room, where will your mother be?

196
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,153
- Probably in the living room. 
- Is that what you really want?

197
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:28,164
- To have dinner with your mother watching? 
- I could ask her to face the wall.

198
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,112
Or you could take Lulu out to a restaurant.

199
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,485
- Which one? 
- Well, what does she like?

200
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:34,666
I don't know. Should I call my brother and find out?

201
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,628
I think if he knew, she'd probably still be with him.

202
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,984
I just really want it to be nice.

203
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:39,934
Just take her someplace where you're comfortable.

204
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,536
It doesn't have to be fancy. If you like it, she'll like it.

205
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,683
Just not one attached to a bowling alley.

206
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:47,902
That narrows it down a bit. I'll figure something out.

207
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:49,105
Good. You'll see - it'll be great.

208
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:52,566
Do you think I could stop by tomorrow with some wardrobe choices for you to pick out?

209
00:09:52,657 --> 00:09:55,889
Kirk, you can dress yourself. Just look nice.

210
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,850
You know, not too fancy. Clean.

211
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:00,456
No jeans.

212
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:03,778
Oh, maybe a sport coat.

213
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,476
- Eleven sound good? 
- Perfect.

214
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,037
A trampoline. That's new.

215
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:15,324
Helps with my shin splints.

216
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,113
Wow. Squeaky.

217
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:19,963
Yup.

218
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:22,306
- Phone. 
- Thanks.

219
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:29,732
Paris, can you get the phone?

220
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:32,343
Paris?

221
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:36,260
- Don't answer it. 
- Why not?

222
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:37,719
It's Jamie and we're fighting.

223
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:39,977
Well, does he know you're fighting? 'Cause he's not hanging up.

224
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,133
Oh, he knows. Trust me, he knows.

225
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:49,597
- You're seriously not gonna answer that? 
- Nope.

226
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,027
- Paris, come on. 
- Fine.

227
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,315
There.

228
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,637
- Why are you and Jamie fighting? 
- Because he's wrong.

229
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:01,286
- Oh, okay. 
- He won't listen to me.

230
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:03,177
You won't listen to me!

231
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:06,151
He's in love with the sound of his own voice.

232
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,717
You'd think he was already president and I don't want to be Hillary.

233
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:11,184
I don't want to wait for a hundred years while he does his thing

234
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:13,401
so by the time I get my chance, I'm too old to enjoy it.

235
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:15,757
- Well, I don't think Hillary's too old to enjoy it. 
- Fine. Be on his side.

236
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,257
I'm not on his side. I'm on her side.

237
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:18,900
Don't answer it.

238
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:21,122
- Paris, I have to study! 
- Go ahead.

239
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:22,796
- I can't! 
- Why not?

240
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,764
The phone.

241
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:25,495
Don't, Rory! I mean it!

242
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:29,283
Hello? Hi, Jamie. Yes, she is here.

243
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,355
Paris, you're acting stupid, okay? You love Jamie,

244
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:36,021
so just get on the phone and work it out so that I can study, okay?

245
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:38,044
What?

246
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,379
No, I haven't thought about what you said.

247
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,834
Because I'm very busy, Jamie, and contrary to your beliefs,

248
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,732
I have better things to occupy my time with than thinking about you.

249
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:48,744
Or what you said.

250
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:51,539
Or what you meant or what you want

251
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,750
or anything about you or concerning you.

252
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:58,349
Have him call you back on your cell phone. Then you can talk to him outside.

253
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,073
- It's nice outside. There are birds and trees. 
- My cell phone is dead.

254
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,696
- Then take mine. 
- What's your phone plan?

255
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,997
Why?

256
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:06,768
'Cause I'm not gonna borrow your phone and get slammed with a massive charge

257
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:08,405
- because your phone plan sucks. 
- Paris!

258
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,983
Jamie, I'm going to call you back on Rory's cell.

259
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:13,469
Yes, I am.

260
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,978
- Yes, I am! 
- Yes, she is!

261
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:17,248
- Okay, bye. 
- Here.

262
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,501
- I'll be back. 
- Take your time.

263
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,346
- Tanna, I'm trying to study. 
- Okay.

264
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,941
- I can hear the TV through the wall. 
- Okay.

265
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:46,432
It's distracting.

266
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:50,139
- Are you telling me to turn it off? 
- I'm not telling...

267
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:52,668
You can, you know, because your grandma paid for the TV.

268
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,044
- I'm not telling you to turn the TV off. 
- Because you can.

269
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:58,127
- The TV belongs to all of us. 
- If it's a matter of volume,

270
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:00,788
I could press my ear to the speaker and then I could turn it really low.

271
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:01,491
Never mind.

272
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,943
The problem there is that the speakers for the TV are mounted up

273
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,164
in the corner of the ceiling, but perhaps if I got a ladder.

274
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:08,145
Never mind, Tanna.

275
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,971
Are you sure you don't want me to turn it off?

276
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:21,536
Try this one.

277
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:24,454
Sookie, I love you, I love your cooking, but I swear if you make me eat

278
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,217
one more bite of broccoli tart, I will beat you to death with it.

279
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:29,911
Your mother is the pickiest woman I have ever catered for.

280
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:32,266
She has impeccable taste, the highest standards,

281
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,939
and she can smell an inferior tart a mile away.

282
00:13:35,123 --> 00:13:37,238
Depending on how long it's been left out, we all can.

283
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,168
- You know, she still hasn't called yet. 
- She will.

284
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:42,026
But she was supposed to call about the details a couple of days ago.

285
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:42,926
She will, Sookie.

286
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,761
But it's coming up and we still don't know if she wants a fish course or a cheese course.

287
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,050
We'll make a fish-cheese combo course just to be sure.

288
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:50,729
- Lorelai. 
- Why do I have to call her?

289
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:54,375
Because technically you're doing the organizing, and I've got batter hands.

290
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,105
Oh, ask her about the foie gras. Is it too expected?

291
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:01,266
'Cause I can make it with a, you know, cherry compote.

292
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:03,627
Okay. You know what to say.

293
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:07,631
- Hello, Mom. 
- Lorelai, hello. How nice to hear from you.

294
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,380
- How are you doing? 
- Well, I'm just fine, thank you for asking.

295
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,274
- Good, I'm glad to hear it. 
- And I'm glad to report it.

296
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:15,690
So the reason I'm calling is we haven't heard from you yet,

297
00:14:15,798 --> 00:14:18,347
and we really need to nail down some of the details of the party.

298
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:20,667
- "We" haven't heard from you yet? 
- Yes, we - me and Sookie.

299
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:24,339
- Ah, yes, the Independence Catering Company. 
- So, anyhow...

300
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,701
You know, a few years ago, there was a company called Independent Catering.

301
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:31,592
They were all the rage until they catered the Kirov benefit for diabetes

302
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,187
that sent 300 people to the hospital with a vicious case of food poisoning.

303
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:37,839
Well, needless to say, they went out of business immediately,

304
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:39,750
and I believe one of them left town without packing.

305
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:42,156
Oh, well, that's a good story. Hans Christian Anderson?

306
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:45,478
You know, some people could mistake the Independence Catering Company

307
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:47,550
with the Independent Catering Company,

308
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:49,523
and that would just be a shame for you, wouldn't it?

309
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:53,092
Now if I'd known what you were going to name your company, I could have warned you.

310
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:55,754
- Mom, I swear, I tried to tell you. 
- You did?

311
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:59,163
Yes, I did. I sent you a flier. Didn't you get my flier?

312
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:01,217
No, I did not get your flier.

313
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:04,642
Oh, well, I sent it, and to be honest with you,

314
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:07,213
I was a little hurt that you didn't call to congratulate me,

315
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,061
but now that I know you didn't get it, I forgive you.

316
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,595
- When did you send a flier? 
- Last week.

317
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:14,974
- What did it say? 
- Oh, you know... come and get it.

318
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:17,396
You wrote "come and get it" on your business flier?

319
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:21,917
No, it was your basic "Introducing the Independence Catering Company", flier.

320
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:25,778
You know, it had our phone number, our address, and an amusing caricature of us.

321
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,461
- Well, that sounds like a very nice flier. 
- Oh, it was.

322
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:31,026
Do you have an extra one? You can bring it with you on Friday night.

323
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:32,496
Sure.

324
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:35,511
Because it's very unusual these days for things to get lost in the mail.

325
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:37,524
You don't think you got the address wrong, do you?

326
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,085
- Mom, the party? 
- All right.

327
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:44,061
I'm going to want a mixture of white, off-white, and cream-colored linen.

328
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,451
A simple bone china with a gold or deep-blue stripe will work.

329
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:49,510
Okay, got it.

330
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:53,396
I'm going with tapers cut in half so that people can see each other across the table.

331
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,389
We'll need white and sterling roses, but not too high or formal.

332
00:15:57,505 --> 00:15:59,150
- Do you have a florist? 
- I have a florist.

333
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,951
- Does he have a flier? 
- Do you want clear or silver vases?

334
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,926
- You must think I'm a complete idiot. 
- No, Mom, I don't.

335
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,109
There is no flier.

336
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:09,278
You're making it up to cover for the fact that you once again

337
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:11,925
neglected to tell me about an important event in your life.

338
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,181
- Mom, I swear there's a flier. 
- Shame on you for swearing there's a flier.

339
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,666
That's the worst possible thing you could do.

340
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:20,758
Liv Tyler grew up her entire life thinking Todd Rundgren was her real father.

341
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,969
You think that might knock this out of first place?

342
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,650
I tell you, if I saw this kind of behavior from some other company I was hiring,

343
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:28,811
- I would fire them on the spot. 
- Then fire us, Mom.

344
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:30,245
Excuse me?

345
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:31,873
You are not hiring your daughter and her friend,

346
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,566
you are hiring a professional catering company. This is not a favor,

347
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:37,879
it is a business transaction, and I must insist that you treat us

348
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,824
exactly as you would any other person off the street.

349
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,861
- As you wish. 
- Thank you.

350
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:45,416
Now I'm sorry, but we're very busy with preparations for your event,

351
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,494
so I'm gonna have to hang up now. Goodbye, Mother.

352
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:48,513
Goodbye.

353
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,314
Horrible woman!

354
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,978
You forgot to ask about the menu.

355
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:57,034
My dorm room has turned into a "Three Stooges" movie.

356
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,198
Shove Pop Tarts under the door in two hours please.

357
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:00,198
Honey...

358
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:02,040
You quiched my room.

359
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,082
- They're not quiche. They're broccoli tarts. 
- Well, then you tarted up my room.

360
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:06,977
I'm sorry, honey, I didn't know you were coming home today.

361
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:08,952
Sookie's just trying some things out for Grandma's party.

362
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:11,376
How am I supposed to study when it smells like broccoli?

363
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,294
- Well, study in the living room. 
- This is not living room study.

364
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:17,202
This is serious bedroom study. I have a ton of work to do.

365
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:20,806
Hey, here's a crazy thought - isn't there someplace at Yale you can study?

366
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,022
- Don't they have like a hundred libraries? 
- Yes, but they don't have that right vibe.

367
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:27,022
They're too quiet and too big and drafty. Very, very drafty.

368
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:29,694
- At least they don't smell like quiche. 
- Enough with the quiche, okay?

369
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:31,865
I can't believe I came all the way home and there's nowhere to work.

370
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,600
- It's just temporary. 
- 'Til the sewing machine comes.

371
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:38,082
Oh, hey... you know how many kids in India would love to come home

372
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:40,335
to a room full of quiche? Sorry - tarts.

373
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:43,626
- Tarts are totally different. 
- I know, honey. I know.

374
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:48,141
Have a seat, Kirk. I'll be right there.

375
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:49,167
Caesar.

376
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,293
You know what the key to a truly successful tuna melt is?

377
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,235
- What? 
- Tuna.

378
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:56,026
- That's not tuna? 
- No, it's turkey.

379
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:57,363
Give me the plate. I'll do it again.

380
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:00,788
Don't get exasperated with me. I'm not the one that made the wrong sandwich.

381
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,346
What are you doing, Kirk?

382
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,654
Say I was Tom Cruise. Where would you seat me?

383
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:19,001
In an acting class.

384
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,878
No, I mean, which do you consider the best seat in the house?

385
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,552
- I don't know. 
- How are the acoustics here?

386
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,215
- What? 
- The bathrooms are right over there.

387
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:27,730
One good loud flush and the entire mood is spoiled.

388
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:30,787
I don't have time to kill you right now, Kirk. Come back in a couple of hours.

389
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,234
All right, I'll just reserve these three tables and decide later.

390
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:36,296
- Reserve these three... 
- For Wednesday night, eight o'clock.

391
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:39,059
- We don't take reservations, Kirk. 
- But this is a special occasion.

392
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:42,619
And Lorelai told me to go somewhere I'm comfortable, and I'm comfortable here.

393
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:43,362
You are?

394
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:48,021
Well, not at this moment, but previously I have been comfortable here.

395
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:49,608
- Please? 
- What's the occasion?

396
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,137
I have a date with a young lady.

397
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:54,744
You really felt the need to add the "with a young lady" part?

398
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,783
Kinda.

399
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:58,773
Okay, you can have one table for eight o'clock.

400
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,610
- Thank you. Here. 
- What's this?

401
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:03,187
It's a diagram of how I would like the table set up.

402
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:08,255
See - little flowers by her plate, and the champagne bucket over here

403
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:10,640
so I don't accidentally knock it off the table with my elbow.

404
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,629
- I don't sell champagne, Kirk. 
- Why not?

405
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:14,830
- Because this is a diner. 
- Good champagne goes with everything.

406
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:17,098
- Get your own champagne, Kirk. 
- But what about the flowers?

407
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,520
- Kirk. 
- Okay, fine.

408
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:20,241
I'll get the champagne and the flowers.

409
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,327
Now, let's say the date goes well. How much for the place upstairs?

410
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,014
- You mean my apartment? 
- Yes.

411
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:29,002
- Bye, Kirk. 
- Okay, see you later.

412
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:33,077
- Excuse me, is that good? 
- Yes.

413
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:34,024
And what is that?

414
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:35,560
Meat loaf.

415
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:39,702
Okay, so, this meat loaf, is it a romantic food for you? I mean, is it getting you hot?

416
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:40,434
Kirk!

417
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:41,730
Good talking to you.

418
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:51,289
I can't believe we're doing this.

419
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:54,326
Well, you did tell her to treat us like any other catering service.

420
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:57,663
"I'd like you to do a test meal, Lorelai. After all, you are a new company."

421
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,758
She must be so happy right now.

422
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:02,937
She's probably been cackling into her magic mirror all morning.

423
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,874
It's going to be a breeze. You wait and see.

424
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:07,310
Three hours of bowing and scraping.

425
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:10,465
We are not going to be bowing and scraping. We're going to be serving and delighting.

426
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,394
Anything to humiliate me, anything at all.

427
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,765
Wow! You grew up here?

428
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,580
- I swear, if she makes me wear a uniform... 
- This is Citizen Kane's house.

429
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,635
- Drape one of those napkins over my arm. 
- Is there a moat?

430
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:25,132
Just help me out here, okay? Run interference whenever you can.

431
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,136
I promise.

432
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:30,985
- May I help you? 
- Hi. We're the caterers. We're here for...

433
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:32,419
The servants' entrance is around back.

434
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:35,839
Was that a maid?

435
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:36,950
Come on.

436
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:41,257
What are all those tennis balls doing over here?

437
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:51,756
Irish studies suck, German studies suck, everything here sucks, sucks, sucks!

438
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:55,403
That yoga's really working for you, Glenn.

439
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,179
Don't get that, I mean it! Do not touch that phone!

440
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,130
Oh, great, I'm glad you got that. It's been bugging me for the last...

441
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:05,031
- Is this the off-white or the cream? 
- The off-white.

442
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,303
The cream is more creamy.

443
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:11,377
I cut those myself so they could be adjusted either way.

444
00:22:11,472 --> 00:22:12,854
I mean, they could be adjusted smaller.

445
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:15,685
Taller would be tougher once they're cut, but,

446
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:18,173
if they tell a lie, they'll shoot right back up.

447
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,345
- I assume you'll have servers. 
- Yes, we will.

448
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:23,453
I assume you'll instruct your servers to omit the Pinocchio humor.

449
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,302
Yes, we will.

450
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:26,193
Okay, here we go.

451
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:30,150
Now, we would start off with either the roasted asparagus

452
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:32,034
with the Parmesan or the trio of winter soups -

453
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:35,065
tomato basil, butternut squash, and Catalonian garlic.

454
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:38,039
- Very ambitious. 
- And very tasty.

455
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,374
I'll tell the servers not to do that either.

456
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,420
- Lorelai? 
- Yes?

457
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,450
- My napkin. 
- Oh, well, yes.

458
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:55,437
Napkin, yes, your napkin. I got it.

459
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,996
- Do you want me to just tuck it in your shirt there or... 
- My lap will be fine.

460
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:01,371
Okay. There you go.

461
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:04,638
Feel free to spill anything you want down there. You are covered.

462
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,526
- What is the next course? 
- Lobster potpie.

463
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,537
- You may bring it out now. 
- Okay.

464
00:23:35,835 --> 00:23:38,379
- Sookie, how far along are you? 
- Eight months.

465
00:23:38,676 --> 00:23:42,455
Lorelai, there doesn't seem to be any reason for a pregnant woman in her eighth month

466
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:44,369
to be running back and forth to the kitchen, does there?

467
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:45,804
No, there doesn't.

468
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:48,982
You should take my plate. Otherwise, you'll have no place to put the potpie.

469
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:50,775
Oh, I can think of a place.

470
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:52,766
- What was that? 
- Plates going bye-bye.

471
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:59,709
Okay, when I give the signal,

472
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:02,463
you run in and distract her and I'll take her down. Got it?

473
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:08,711
Here we go - Sookie's famous lobster potpie.

474
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:15,514
- Very nice crust. 
- Thank you.

475
00:24:22,536 --> 00:24:26,576
Well, Sookie, I must say your food is as accomplished as I remember it.

476
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:27,824
Oh, thank you, Emily.

477
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:30,625
And I think after we fine-tune the presentation,

478
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,087
we'll have ourselves a very nice dinner party.

479
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:36,154
- So we got the job? 
- Yes, you got the job.

480
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:40,584
We got the job. Thank you. You will not be disappointed.

481
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:44,130
No, I will not. The event starts at 7:30,

482
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:45,816
I would like you to be here at four o'clock.

483
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,340
I'm going to make a Xerox copy of my notes here

484
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:50,281
so the two of you can peruse it on the way home.

485
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:57,254
We did it, we got the job! What a score! We landed a whale.

486
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,782
Yeah, we always had the job, Sookie. The whale was just toying with us.

487
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:03,859
She was swatting us with her tail and hosing us down with her blowhole

488
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:08,437
because that is the whale's M.O. - humiliate and rip apart every other fish in the sea

489
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:11,662
until there's nothing left but a bloody pile of chum.

490
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,135
Boy, you really hate whales, don't you?

491
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:20,965
It's amazing. Out of the blue, bam! It was right there.

492
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:23,162
Well, things always happen when you least expect it.

493
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:26,725
- I have to tell you, this tree is perfect. 
- All girls think their tree is perfect.

494
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:29,617
It fits my back completely, and there's plenty of grass,

495
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,209
and it's in a great area - just far enough away from anything major

496
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,666
so there's not a lot of noise but still not in Siberia.

497
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:38,192
Hey, can it cook? 'Cause I can get it a great gig with a crazy woman.

498
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:41,994
- Grandma's not crazy. She's specific. 
- Well, at least one of us is happy.

499
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,471
- And thank God it's me. 
- My feelings exactly.

500
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:47,441
You have no idea how much studying I got done today.

501
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:50,185
- Seriously, ask me anything. 
- Okay.

502
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:53,488
How'd I get shanghaied into catering a party for my mother?

503
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,865
You keep repeating yourself.

504
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:59,063
Well, as soon as I hear you talking about a study shrub, I'll know it's time to move on.

505
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,282
Okay, fine, I have to go.

506
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,964
Yeah? Gonna go shopping for a nice yellow ribbon?

507
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:04,983
- Have some chili fries for me. 
- I will.

508
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,033
Cheeseburger, onion rings, and a list of people

509
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,632
who killed their parents and got away with it. I'm looking for heroes.

510
00:26:11,714 --> 00:26:13,558
- How'd the tasting go? 
- We got the job.

511
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,791
- Would have been pathetic if you hadn't. 
- I can't do this.

512
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:18,033
- It's a gig. 
- Yes, it is a gig.

513
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:21,582
It's Prince opening for the Rolling Stones. That's the kind of gig it is.

514
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,006
- Luke... 
- Yeah?

515
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:26,732
- What's Kirk doing? 
- Practicing.

516
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,338
- For what? 
- His date.

517
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,461
He's doing a test run - talking, eating, making conversation.

518
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:35,411
Then he's gonna go home and review the tape and adjust from there.

519
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:38,854
Boy! You ever think about how many different ways

520
00:26:38,995 --> 00:26:41,760
- Kirk could get kicked out of the Army? 
- What a poor slob.

521
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,084
- He's pathetic. 
- He likes a girl. That's sweet.

522
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:47,703
All day long, I have this crazy person sitting in my diner ordering everything off the menu,

523
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:51,815
by the way, to see which meal has less crumb-to-sweater ratio.

524
00:26:51,938 --> 00:26:54,646
Well, if he's bugging you that much, you can ask him to leave.

525
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,449
You ask him to leave. It's your fault he's here.

526
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:58,102
How is it my fault? I'm not going out with him.

527
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:00,268
You're the one that told him to find someplace he felt comfortable.

528
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,836
How did I know he felt comfortable here?

529
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,741
I don't know. All I know is that you talked to him,

530
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:05,965
and now he's over there talking to a camera.

531
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:07,589
Oh, come on, Luke. Give him a break.

532
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:09,467
He wants the date to go well.

533
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:12,695
I mean, it's all any of us wants -

534
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:17,532
to find a nice person to hang out with 'til we drop dead. Not a lot to ask.

535
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:18,378
I guess.

536
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:22,069
And look on the positive side - if Kirk's date goes well, he'll be occupied,

537
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:23,851
and you'll be seeing a lot less of him at the diner.

538
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:26,734
Cut! Okay, that sucked!

539
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:29,947
Let's just go again right away.

540
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,883
Focus! Focus.

541
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:36,365
I'll have his monogrammed booth installed tomorrow.

542
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:42,792
All right, I think this should be everyone.

543
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:44,138
You've double-checked it?

544
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:46,728
I have double-checked it, but I'm sure you will also double-check it.

545
00:27:46,877 --> 00:27:47,728
You know I will.

546
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,174
So I am entirely confident that no one will be left out.

547
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,169
- This is very nice. 
- Isn't it, though?

548
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:55,509
It's a florist Lorelai found. We're using him for the party.

549
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,296
Oh, I think that will be perfect.

550
00:27:57,405 --> 00:28:00,020
It has to be perfect. These are important people we're trying to impress.

551
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:03,267
- Richard, Emily. 
- Jason, what a pleasant surprise.

552
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,663
Richard, you should have told me Jason was coming over.

553
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:07,024
I would have had something prepared.

554
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,118
Oh, please, Emily, I've gained ten pounds since I came into this house.

555
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:12,227
Men always say that and it's never true.

556
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:14,004
I just dropped by for the keys to the office.

557
00:28:14,117 --> 00:28:15,873
Ah, that's right. Forgot to give you the keys.

558
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:18,826
Oh, my apologies, Jason. Here you go.

559
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,006
Thank you. Sorry to interrupt your evening. I'll see you tomorrow.

560
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,600
Oh, Jason, I'm going to need your guest list as soon as possible.

561
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,438
- My guest list? 
- To the launch party.

562
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:31,068
Oh, Richard, you did remember to ask Jason for his list, didn't you?

563
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,758
Emily, I am a very busy man.

564
00:28:32,902 --> 00:28:35,600
Oh, honestly, Richard, that's what you have a secretary for.

565
00:28:36,168 --> 00:28:38,103
Jason, I apologize for my husband.

566
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,924
The official launch party for your company is next week.

567
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,043
I've got the entire thing organized. All I need is your guest list.

568
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:45,451
You organized a launch party.

569
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:47,565
Yes, and trust me when I tell you that there is no one

570
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:51,687
who can throw together a more elegant event at the drop of a hat than Emily Gilmore.

571
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,109
True, and thank you, and you still forgot to tell him.

572
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,803
Well, Emily, I really appreciate the thought,

573
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:58,138
but I'm not so sure a launch party is the way to go.

574
00:28:58,312 --> 00:28:59,090
What do you mean?

575
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,127
Jason, it's traditional to do something for our clients. They appreciate it.

576
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,634
It gives us a chance to talk to them one-on-one, develop relationships.

577
00:29:05,772 --> 00:29:08,650
It's the extra little things that set you apart in business, Jason.

578
00:29:08,758 --> 00:29:10,534
I couldn't agree more, and that is why

579
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:13,873
- I've organized a trip to Atlantic City. 
- What?

580
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:17,287
You know, get everybody out, away from business, away from their spouses,

581
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:20,473
away from stuffy cocktail-party music and floral arrangements.

582
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:24,404
Have a little crazy fun - you know, good food, lots to drink,

583
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:26,201
maybe a little gambling, a show, and trust me,

584
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:28,474
nothing bonds two businessmen together more than one of them

585
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:30,978
finding the other hung over with a hooker in their bed the next morning.

586
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:32,632
- What? 
- Just a figure of speech, Emily.

587
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:36,063
You cannot be serious. These are dignified men and women.

588
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:38,760
- There are mobsters in Atlantic City. 
- Let's hope so.

589
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:41,468
- Talk to him. 
- Well, Jason, I'm not so sure this...

590
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:43,914
Richard, this is the kind of thing that could set us apart from the other companies.

591
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:45,502
It's different, maybe a little crazy,

592
00:29:45,565 --> 00:29:48,955
but they will remember it and they will tell their friends about it.

593
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,793
Yes, I suppose they will.

594
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:53,895
Every other company in town is throwing a dignified cocktail party.

595
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:59,292
Believe me, right now my mother has twelve caterers throttling every sturgeon they can find

596
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:01,253
to get fine caviar for my father's clients.

597
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:04,345
Let's not give our clients canap�s, Richard.

598
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:07,069
- Let's give 'em some fun. 
- Well, it is different.

599
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:10,157
- You can't be serious. 
- Well, it's good to change with the times.

600
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:12,967
You're running an insurance company, not a rap label.

601
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,312
People aren't looking to you to give them a good time.

602
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,462
They are looking to you to protect their livelihood.

603
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:19,102
Now let's think about this for a moment.

604
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:23,766
I mean, how far along is this party? Is it too late to cancel?

605
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:25,998
No, it's not too late to cancel.

606
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:27,028
All right.

607
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:30,494
Jason, we'll try it your way. Atlantic City it is.

608
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:33,544
I think it's a good move, Richard. And Emily, thank you again for the offer.

609
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:37,113
- But see, now you can just hang out and relax. 
- My two favorite things.

610
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,600
- All right, see you tomorrow. 
- See you tomorrow.

611
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,387
Excuse me, you're sitting under my tree.

612
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:04,240
- What? 
- My study tree, this is my study tree.

613
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:05,765
What the hell's a study tree?

614
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,047
- Okay. See, I have roommates... 
- So do I.

615
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,865
Yes, but I have Paris and I have Tanna

616
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:12,939
and I have Janet, and Janet squeaks...

617
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,937
Look, I'm busy, okay?

618
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:17,899
Yes, I see you're very busy with your "Trucker's Monthly" there,

619
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,002
but I finally found a great place to study, and you're sitting on it.

620
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:22,564
There's a million trees on campus.

621
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:25,734
But this one fits my back perfectly so I don't get tired, and the light is right,

622
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:29,087
and it's just far enough away from anything busy so that the noise level is perfect,

623
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,734
and it's quiet but not Unabomber, and...

624
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:35,696
and anyhow, I was just hoping that maybe

625
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,379
you would consider giving me back my tree.

626
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:39,189
No.

627
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,278
Well...

628
00:31:58,312 --> 00:31:58,989
After you.

629
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,522
Wow, this place seems nice.

630
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:04,256
Yes, diners are apparently all the rage nowadays.

631
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:05,435
Really?

632
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,616
Very hip. Very, very hip.

633
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:09,727
- Excuse me. 
- Yes?

634
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,399
I believe I have reservations for two. The name's Kirk.

635
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,981
Kirk, yes. Okay. Follow me.

636
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:20,185
- How's this? 
- Very satisfactory. Thank you.

637
00:32:20,754 --> 00:32:23,257
- There's more where that came from. 
- It's my lucky night.

638
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:28,660
- Wow, I'm getting the fancy treatment. 
- Well, you did show up.

639
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:30,302
Yes, I did.

640
00:32:32,157 --> 00:32:33,780
I hear the meat loaf is excellent here.

641
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:40,241
Coming, coming, coming.

642
00:32:44,352 --> 00:32:44,859
Mom.

643
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:47,363
- Were you asleep? 
- No.

644
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:50,102
- Then why are you in your pajamas? 
- These aren't pajamas.

645
00:32:50,189 --> 00:32:51,074
You wear that in public?

646
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:53,108
Hi, Mom. Would you like to come in?

647
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,712
You have the word "juicy" on your rear end.

648
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,512
Well, if I had known you were coming over, I would have changed.

649
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,930
Into what, a brassiere with the word "tasty" on it?

650
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:06,855
Hey, Mom, what can I do for you?

651
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:10,218
- I have to talk to you about something. 
- Is everything okay?

652
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:14,494
I'm afraid you aren't going to be catering the launch party after all.

653
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:15,907
What? Why?

654
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,015
Your father and I just decided to go a different way, that's all.

655
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:20,254
A different way?

656
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,696
Now, of course, I realize you've already put out some money.

657
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,885
Yeah, we have.

658
00:33:24,022 --> 00:33:26,992
Of course, I will reimburse you for all expenses. Just give me the receipts.

659
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:28,119
Great.

660
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,059
That's it. That's all I came to tell you.

661
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:33,197
Okay, well, thanks for the notice.

662
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:35,394
You don't have to take that tone with me, Lorelai.

663
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:38,763
Really, I don't? After you made us do that ridiculous tasting at the house?

664
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:40,673
You told me to treat you like any other company.

665
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:44,139
Oh, but you sat there like the Queen of England, making us jump through hoops

666
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:47,590
and taking ridiculous notes and for what - so you could fire us?

667
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:49,996
Is this payback for me not telling you about the business?

668
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:53,765
Because, I have to say, Mom, even for you, it seems a little extreme.

669
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:56,040
- I understand you're upset. 
- Yes, I'm upset!

670
00:33:56,156 --> 00:33:59,730
We needed that money, Mom. And I knew that humiliation was part of the package,

671
00:33:59,847 --> 00:34:01,983
but I did it because I had to,

672
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:05,141
and - just you abruptly firing us is completely wrong!

673
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:06,529
I agree, it is wrong.

674
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:09,426
Well, okay, then...

675
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,703
as long as you agree it's wrong... what? Okay.

676
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,420
I'm sorry, Lorelai. I really am.

677
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:18,992
I thought your table was lovely.

678
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:21,039
I thought the food was wonderful.

679
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,532
I was really looking forward to this party.

680
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,415
I think it might have been the best one I ever put on.

681
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:28,407
So, then, what happened?

682
00:34:28,915 --> 00:34:31,131
Oh, you know, times change, Lorelai.

683
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,130
Things that were once considered proper and elegant

684
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:36,083
are now considered stuffy and out-of-date.

685
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:37,146
Like what?

686
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:41,033
Like canap�s and cocktail parties and the people who plan them.

687
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:44,268
- Mom, what are you talking about? 
- Nothing. It's not important.

688
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:45,338
Mom, come on.

689
00:34:47,638 --> 00:34:51,114
Jason decided to take the clients to Atlantic City instead.

690
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,321
He thinks that's what they would prefer to do.

691
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,329
He's probably right anyhow. What do I know?

692
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:57,161
Did he know all the work you put into this?

693
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:58,574
It's really not important, Lorelai.

694
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:00,622
I do this for your father.

695
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:03,965
I have done this for your father for the last 36 years.

696
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,736
If he thinks that Jason's right, then it's fine with me.

697
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,987
And after all, now I don't have to worry about a party.

698
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,470
I can just relax and hang out.

699
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:13,836
Mom.

700
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:15,373
Anyhow, I have to go.

701
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,653
I'm wasting all my hanging-out time sitting here talking about this silly party.

702
00:35:20,442 --> 00:35:22,403
Send me those receipts and I'll get you a check.

703
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:25,009
Okay, well, great.

704
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:27,844
- Apologize to Sookie for me, will you? 
- Sure.

705
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:29,426
We'll see you girls Friday night.

706
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:41,634
Oh, my gosh, that's so funny.

707
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:46,416
That's amazing, you sound just like him.

708
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:57,393
- Luke. 
- Jeez! Kirk, what are you doing?

709
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:59,747
- I need your help. 
- I'm filling the coffee here.

710
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:01,864
- Look behind me. 
- What am I looking at, Kirk?

711
00:36:02,063 --> 00:36:04,131
- Is she still there? 
- Who?

712
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:06,661
- Lulu. Is Lulu still there? 
- You mean your date?

713
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:08,555
Yes, Lulu, my date. Who else would I mean?

714
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:11,279
- Catch up, man. Time is of the essence. 
- Yes, she's still there.

715
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:14,059
- Are you sure? 
- Yes, I'm sure, now get out from behind my counter.

716
00:36:14,228 --> 00:36:15,845
I don't know what to do.

717
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:19,445
What are you talking about? I just looked over there and everything seemed fine.

718
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:21,380
- Exactly. Everything seemed fine. 
- So?

719
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:23,014
- Doesn't that seem weird to you? 
- No.

720
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,216
- Really? 
- Yes, a little, but so what?

721
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:29,245
- Why question it? Go back over there. 
- I can't. I don't understand what's happening.

722
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:31,580
I mean, she was looking at me. Directly at me.

723
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:34,852
At first I thought I had something on my lip, but I brushed and brushed and nothing.

724
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:37,514
- She was just looking at me. 
- Well, that's good.

725
00:36:37,622 --> 00:36:40,024
And I have prepared several small-talk subjects for the evening

726
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:42,317
- and I haven't used one of them. 
- You're making too much of this.

727
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,195
This is not how it's supposed to go. I'm supposed to take her out,

728
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:47,755
we're supposed to exhaust my prepared subjects immediately,

729
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:49,414
and then the minute I get up and go to the bathroom,

730
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:52,306
she is supposed to sneak out and leave me here humiliated.

731
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,954
Now I have been to the bathroom three times, and I have to tell you,

732
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:57,396
I did not have to go, and every time I came back to the table,

733
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,562
she was there and she was smiling, and...

734
00:36:59,691 --> 00:37:02,531
hey, did you see her touch my arm? What the hell was that all about?

735
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:05,722
- I think that means she likes you. 
- Shut up! You take that back!

736
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:09,653
Kirk, Kirk, I am not gonna fight with you over you not believing that this girl likes you

737
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,848
because, to be honest with you, I'm a little fuzzy on the "why" myself,

738
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:16,023
- but the bottom line is she does. 
- She does?

739
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:19,360
Yes, she's laughing and smiling, and buckle up, cowboy,

740
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:21,371
because I think she might actually touch you again.

741
00:37:21,465 --> 00:37:22,039
You think?

742
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:25,100
There's a frightening chance she might, so my advice to you

743
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:28,556
is to go back over there and continue doing what you've been doing.

744
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:30,989
I was doing my Jon Cryer from "Pretty in Pink" impression.

745
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,130
- Duckie? 
- Yes, Duckie.

746
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,498
Were you near the end of the movie yet?

747
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:35,483
No, just getting to the "Try a Little Tenderness" moment.

748
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:38,577
You've got plenty of ammo left. Go on. Go back over there.

749
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:41,535
- You think she likes me? 
- I think she likes you.

750
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:43,046
You think she likes me.

751
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:48,530
God help us one and all.

752
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:52,104
No, just leave another message that I called.

753
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:53,537
Thank you.

754
00:37:54,193 --> 00:37:56,128
Number 42, see ya.

755
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,704
You don't have to throw them all out, Sookie.

756
00:37:58,801 --> 00:38:00,883
- I didn't. I've got twenty in the freezer. 
- Great.

757
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,378
- And so do you. 
- Even better.

758
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:04,130
I already had that money spent.

759
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:07,243
It was going towards a down payment on a safer car.

760
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,987
Now little Davey will have to fend for himself rolling around in the back of Daddy's truck.

761
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:12,410
- Mom? 
- Kitchen.

762
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:14,996
"Hold on, Davey! Daddy's coming to a sudden stop."

763
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,083
- You're being dramatic. 
- But I'm so disappointed.

764
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:20,632
I mean, all that planning, all that time, all that broccoli.

765
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,147
- I lost my tree. 
- What?

766
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:25,227
My tree, my study tree - it's gone. Someone stole it.

767
00:38:25,496 --> 00:38:27,862
- Someone stole a tree? 
- No, the tree's still there,

768
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:30,826
but when I went there today, there was this guy sitting there reading trucking magazines

769
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:32,987
and he would not give it up, so now I'm back where I started.

770
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:34,022
You'll figure something out.

771
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:36,714
Yes, I will figure out what my alternate profession will be

772
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:39,376
because now I can't study, I'm gonna flunk out of Yale

773
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:41,943
and I'm gonna have to give up all hope of being a foreign correspondent.

774
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,682
- This sucks. 
- You're telling me?

775
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:46,956
- I'm eating broccoli tarts for the next four years. 
- Well, what am I gonna do?

776
00:38:47,113 --> 00:38:48,900
- You are gonna suck it up. 
- What?

777
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:51,363
You're in college now, Rory. If your study plan doesn't work,

778
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,867
then come up with another one. Just figure it out,

779
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:55,832
but stop complaining because you're not two.

780
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:58,433
And Sookie, in pioneer times, kids traveled across the country

781
00:38:58,521 --> 00:39:00,262
in covered wagons and survived.

782
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:02,823
Somehow I think little Davey will live without his minivan.

783
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:05,649
- Mom, why are you mad? 
- I have something I have to do.

784
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:09,325
I'll be back in a little while. And have these damn tarts out of here by the time I get home!

785
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:12,958
Grab a fork.

786
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:18,033
Well, hello, Digger Stiles.

787
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,414
Lorelai Gilmore, you sure grew up good.

788
00:39:20,537 --> 00:39:23,527
Oh, did I, Digger? Thanks. Listen, why didn't you return my calls?

789
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,665
- 'Cause I hadn't seen you yet. 
- Four times. You never called me back.

790
00:39:26,752 --> 00:39:29,149
- I'll call you back now. What's your number? 
- 976-bite-me.

791
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:30,505
Okay, did you get that, Ms. Lomay?

792
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,431
Because I know how much you like having numbers in your files.

793
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:33,650
- We need to talk. 
- In my office?

794
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:34,479
Great.

795
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:36,675
- You know what? You can go. 
- All right.

796
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:38,518
- Goodnight, Mr. Stiles. 
- Goodnight.

797
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:40,905
- Would you like something to drink? 
- Oh, no, thanks.

798
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,272
- So how you been? 
- Great. You?

799
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:43,982
- No complaints. 
- Okay, small talk over.

800
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:48,595
I want you to know something - you can't just waltz into people's lives and take over.

801
00:39:48,657 --> 00:39:50,796
I don't waltz at all. It's embarrassing and a little gay.

802
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:53,811
You know, people were hired for this party, people who were counting on this money.

803
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:55,343
- What party? 
- Launch party.

804
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:57,007
- Oh, that. 
- Yes, that.

805
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,638
And I want to tell you something else - my mother has been planning

806
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:03,654
these stupid parties for years, and it was completely out of line for you

807
00:40:03,729 --> 00:40:07,201
to walk in there and just crap all over the whole thing

808
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,429
and make her feel obsolete and useless.

809
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:13,089
Hold on there. I never knew about the party. They never told me about the party.

810
00:40:13,186 --> 00:40:14,932
Of course they never told you about the party

811
00:40:15,025 --> 00:40:16,607
because they're inconsiderate and self-centered,

812
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:19,238
and they have been that way for many years, so they have dibs.

813
00:40:19,372 --> 00:40:22,069
But the minute you found out about the party, you should have canceled your plans.

814
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:24,952
It was too late for that. And I never called your mother obsolete,

815
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:27,159
- I just called cocktail parties obsolete. 
- Same thing.

816
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:31,409
- I don't see how. 
- Jason, my mother is a corporate wife.

817
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:35,842
Her job is putting these parties on, and you put her out of work.

818
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:37,834
You know that, your mother does the same thing.

819
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:41,562
Imagine if you took these functions away from her. What would she have left?

820
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:42,626
More time with the pool boy?

821
00:40:42,714 --> 00:40:45,663
You embarrassed my mother and made her feel small.

822
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:49,150
You unceremoniously canceled something she had been working on for days.

823
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:50,388
But I didn't know.

824
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:52,339
And then she had to come to my house and fire me!

825
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:55,704
- Fire you? Why would she fire you? 
- Because I was the caterer.

826
00:40:55,775 --> 00:40:57,035
Get out of town!

827
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,411
Yes, I have a partner in a small catering company.

828
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:01,133
- You cook? 
- I plan.

829
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:04,422
I had no idea how much chaos my little weekend was causing.

830
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:06,793
No, you didn't, because you didn't think. You never thought.

831
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:09,994
Back in summer camp, you never thought. "Hey, if I stand up in this canoe,

832
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:13,076
maybe it'll tip over." That was the extent of your thought process.

833
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,707
- You're still mad about that. 
- I was fully dressed.

834
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:18,155
- I remember, green T-shirt, no bra. 
- What?

835
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:21,120
Trust me, I was the hero of cabin five for the rest of the summer.

836
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,331
- You will apologize to my mother. 
- Absolutely.

837
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:25,495
- And you will let her throw that party. 
- Sorry.

838
00:41:25,645 --> 00:41:26,884
- Digger! 
- Umlauts!

839
00:41:26,996 --> 00:41:29,286
The party is off. Now this is business. I will apologize to Emily,

840
00:41:29,383 --> 00:41:32,921
- but that is the best I can do. 
- I can't believe you just called me Umlauts.

841
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,465
You called me Digger three times before I called you Umlauts once.

842
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:37,887
- I think that shows great self-control. 
- Let my mother have her party!

843
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:40,862
No, I can't do it, but what I can do is take you out to dinner tomorrow night.

844
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:44,180
I'm sorry, how do those two thoughts even coincide?

845
00:41:44,262 --> 00:41:46,479
You'd have to be in my head, but trust me, there was a track.

846
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,779
- I am not having dinner with you. 
- Why not?

847
00:41:48,977 --> 00:41:53,150
Because you just had me fired. You just insulted my mother.

848
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:54,993
It's interesting, I didn't know you and your mother were so close.

849
00:41:55,091 --> 00:41:56,982
- We're not. 
- You're being awfully protective of her.

850
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,439
Well, every family has a Fredo.

851
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,569
Yeah, and Fredo's family put two in the back of his head.

852
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,228
My relationship with my mother is none of your business.

853
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:03,477
- Then have dinner with me. 
- No!

854
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,594
- Why not? 
- Because.

855
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:06,918
Because your mother would hate it.

856
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:08,591
Yes, my mother would hate it.

857
00:42:10,856 --> 00:42:11,459
A lot.

858
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,896
You suck.

859
00:42:27,941 --> 00:42:28,790
Excuse me.

860
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,371
- Remember me? 
- I got here first.

861
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:34,607
I know. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry about the other day.

862
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:38,666
I got a little wound up because I do that sometimes.

863
00:42:38,748 --> 00:42:42,472
I get too structured and too serious and I just have to adjust, you know,

864
00:42:42,636 --> 00:42:46,219
because we're in college and college is about change,

865
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:48,963
and you have my study tree, so yeah, I just...

866
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:52,523
I have to be okay with that and just learn to kind of go with the flow.

867
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:57,146
So I just wanted to tell you that, and I'm sorry if I interrupted you again.

868
00:42:57,448 --> 00:42:58,073
That's okay.

869
00:43:01,615 --> 00:43:03,371
I'll give you twenty bucks for the tree.

870
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:06,762
- You're gonna pay me for the tree? 
- Go with the flow, man.

871
00:43:07,078 --> 00:43:07,549
You're on.
