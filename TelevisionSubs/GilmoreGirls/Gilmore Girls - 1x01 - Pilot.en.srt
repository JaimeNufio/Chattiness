1
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,677
Please, Luke.

2
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,514
How many cups
have you had this morning?

3
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:57,053
- None.
- Plus?

4
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,088
Five, but yours is better.

5
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:01,455
- You have a problem.
- Yes, I do.

6
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:05,325
- Junkie.
- Angel.

7
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:07,495
You've got wings, baby.

8
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,289
Luke's. Yeah.

9
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:18,205
You make that look really good.

10
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:21,768
It is really good.
It's the best coffee in town.

11
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:24,470
- Yeah? I'll have to get a cup.
- Good plan.

12
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:26,035
I've never been here before.

13
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:28,911
Just passing through
on my way to Hartford.

14
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:31,245
You're a regular Jack Kerouac.

15
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:36,584
- Mind if I sit down?
- Actually, I'm meeting someone...

16
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:38,317
- I'm Joey.
- Okay.

17
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:40,888
You don't have a name?

18
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,483
I do have a name.
I just am really meeting someone.

19
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,756
So I guess I should get going.

20
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,353
- So soon?
- What?

21
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:50,263
I'm just screwing with your mind.
It's nice to meet you.

22
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:54,428
- Enjoy Hartford.
- Enjoy your coffee, mystery woman.

23
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:56,570
I like that.

24
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:02,206
- Hey, it's freezing.
- What do you need? Hot tea, coffee?

25
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:03,608
Lip gloss.

26
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:08,848
I have vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
and toasted marshmallow.

27
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,247
Anything in there
not resembling a breakfast cereal?

28
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,310
Yes. It has no smell,
but it changes colors with your mood.

29
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:18,722
- RuPaul doesn't need this much makeup.
- You're crabby.

30
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:21,851
I'm sorry. I lost my Macy Gray CD,
and I need caffeine.

31
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,758
- I have your CD.
- Thief.

32
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,456
Sorry, and I will get you some coffee.

33
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:33,803
What? It's not for me.
It's for Rory, I swear.

34
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,031
- You're shameless.
- Look, Officer Krupke...

35
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:38,630
she's right at that table, right over there.

36
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:43,770
He's got quite a pair, this guy. Thanks.

37
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:48,544
- I've never been through here before.
- You have, too.

38
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:50,243
Hi.

39
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,115
- You really like my table, don't you?
- I was just...

40
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:55,347
Getting to know my daughter.

41
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,219
Are you my new daddy?

42
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,886
You don't look old enough
to have a daughter.

43
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,222
I mean it.

44
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:05,355
And you don't look like a daughter.

45
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:08,466
That's possibly very sweet of you. Thanks.

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,391
So, daughter.

47
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:16,830
- You know, I am traveling with a friend.
- She's 16.

48
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,002
- Bye.
- Drive safe.

49
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:36,063
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

50
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,229
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

51
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,804
No, I'm sorry. We're completely booked.

52
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,774
We have a wedding party here.

53
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,903
No, there is really nothing I can do.

54
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,804
Yes, I'm sure. Positive.

55
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:55,242
No, I don't have to look, ma'am.
Yes, of course I'll look.

56
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:01,347
No, I'm sorry. We're completely booked.

57
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:02,754
No, don't move.

58
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:06,488
Just ignore the tiny woman
pushing the 200-pound instrument around.

59
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:10,653
This is good. I like this.
Maybe after this I'll bench-press a piano.

60
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:13,355
That's it, lady. Tie your shoe now.

61
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:15,334
Don't worry. I'll wait.

62
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:17,762
- Hi, Drella.
- Hi.

63
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:21,932
I was just wondering,
could you be nicer to the guests?

64
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:25,207
I'm sorry. Did you not want a harp player?

65
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:28,177
- Yes, I did.
- Did you not want a great harp player?

66
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:33,239
- Yes, I did.
- I am a great harp player.

67
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:35,512
And this is my great harp, okay?

68
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:38,384
So if you just want someone
to be nice to the guests...

69
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:41,390
get a harmonica player.
Some guy who whistles through his nose.

70
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,721
Okay? Capisce?

71
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:47,784
And that is a great spot for a table.
The decorator's a genius.

72
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,691
Madame, you have no idea
how desperately I'd like to help...

73
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,291
but I'd have to build a room
for you myself...

74
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:56,528
and I'm not a man
who works with his hands.

75
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:58,663
So the best I can do is suggest...

76
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:02,299
that you please try for another weekend.
Any weekend.

77
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:08,107
Good. Fine. The 21st. Hold on, I'll look.

78
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:12,414
No, I'm sorry. We're completely booked.

79
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:20,522
- Has the plumber attended to Room 4 yet?
- He was here. He did nothing. It's $100.

80
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:25,660
Hi, Marco. Lorelai.

81
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,094
Talk to me about Room 4.
What was wrong with it?

82
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,965
I thought you replaced that already.

83
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:35,468
Because you told me you did.
I never forget anything.

84
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:37,300
So this one's on you, right?

85
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:39,772
Pleasure doing business with you.

86
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,034
- What is your offspring doing?
- I need stamps. Can I have these?

87
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,543
- No.
- Take them.

88
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,477
- What's with the muumuu?
- Stop.

89
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:50,073
You couldn't find one made of metal,
in case anyone has x-ray eyes?

90
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:51,913
And now we say goodbye.

91
00:06:51,985 --> 00:06:54,782
Have Michel look at your French paper
before you go.

92
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,081
Excuse me?

93
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:57,588
- That would be great.
- No.

94
00:06:57,656 --> 00:07:01,182
Come on, Michel.
I'll tell all the ladies what a stud you are.

95
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:03,686
I believe that memo has already been sent.

96
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:04,989
Please, Michel.

97
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:08,225
Pretty please with sucre on top?
I will stop talking like this.

98
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:11,198
Leave it. I'll look at it if I get a chance.

99
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:15,033
It's due tomorrow.
And pay special attention to the grammar.

100
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:20,333
I despise you.

101
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:30,850
When are you gonna let your parents know
that you listen to the evil rock music?

102
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,318
You're an American teenager,
for God's sake.

103
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:35,115
If my parents still get upset...

104
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,622
over the obscene portion size
of American food...

105
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,989
I seriously doubt I'm going to make
any inroads with Eminem.

106
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,525
- I have to go to that.
- The hayride? You're kidding.

107
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:47,563
My parents set me up
with the son of a business associate.

108
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,997
He's gonna be a doctor.

109
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,125
- How old is he?
- Sixteen.

110
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,899
So he's gonna be a doctor in 100 years.

111
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:55,904
My parents like to plan ahead.

112
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:59,838
- You have to go to the hayride with him?
- And his older brother.

113
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,743
- Now you're kidding.
- Koreans never joke about future doctors.

114
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,914
I guess you're not going?

115
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:09,781
No. I'm still fuzzy on what's fun
about sitting in the cold for two hours...

116
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:14,116
- with a bundle of sticks up your butt.
- Don't expect me to clear it up for you.

117
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:21,293
For those of you who have not finished
the final chapters of Huckleberry Finn...

118
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:23,453
you may use this time to do so.

119
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,965
For those of you who have,
you can start on your essay now.

120
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:30,194
Whichever task you choose, do it silently.

121
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:48,150
- Maybe it's a love letter.
- Or her diary.

122
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:50,114
Could be a slam book.

123
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:55,885
It's the assignment.

124
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:17,933
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

125
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,708
Tell it to the tip jar.

126
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,405
Take the bags up to 314.

127
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:26,040
Make sure the drapes are closed
and there's extra soap...

128
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:28,277
and she wants her pillow mints now.

129
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:33,146
- Sookie!
- I'm okay.

130
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:37,118
What did you do now?
Why weren't you watching her?

131
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:38,624
No estabas cuidandola?

132
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:42,129
No. She's this. Bad food in the head.

133
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:46,391
- I need you to be more careful.
- I know. I'm sorry.

134
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,366
I fixed the peach sauce.

135
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:51,199
- That's blood. Why are you bleeding?
- My stitches opened.

136
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:54,068
I was using too much maple syrup.
It strangled the fruit.

137
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,803
- When did you get stitches?
- Friday night. Radish roses.

138
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:58,002
Okay, stop moving.

139
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:00,874
You gotta taste the sauce
while it's still warm.

140
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:03,642
Sookie, I need you to be more careful.

141
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:06,548
I need there to be fewer accidents.

142
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:12,489
Dear God Almighty, that's incredible!

143
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:15,251
I'll put it on the waffles tomorrow morning
for breakfast.

144
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:17,885
- I wanna take a bath in that sauce.
- I will make more.

145
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:22,590
Someday when we open our own inn,
diabetics will line up to eat this sauce.

146
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,757
Won't that be great?

147
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:28,699
The key to someday achieving that dream
is for you to stay alive long enough...

148
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,101
so we can actually open an inn,
you understand?

149
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,401
- Yes, I understand.
- All right.

150
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,971
Now let's get you up and to the doctor
on three. One, two, three.

151
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,067
What?

152
00:10:39,145 --> 00:10:42,409
Stepped on my thumb. I'm fine.
On three. Okay.

153
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:47,109
- Was it a good color, at least?
- It had sparkles in it.

154
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:50,854
And it smelled like bubble gum
when it dried.

155
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:53,322
There's no way Mark Twain
could compete with that.

156
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,586
Mom, we're home!

157
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,593
- Did you hear something?
- I'm not sure.

158
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:03,462
Mom, are you here?

159
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:05,831
We're open. Everything's half off.

160
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:07,493
We have contact.

161
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,431
- Mom!
- Lane?

162
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,436
Mom, where are you?

163
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,500
- Lane, where are you?
- Back here.

164
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:18,141
Over here.

165
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:21,345
I think she's that way.

166
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,512
- Are we closer?
- I'm by the table.

167
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,582
She's kidding, right?

168
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,721
Look, we'll meet you in the kitchen.

169
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,517
- What?
- The kitchen!

170
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,357
- Who's that?
- It's Rory, Mom.

171
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,493
I could hear the disappointment from here.

172
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:40,029
Come on. Stop it.

173
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:43,156
It sucks that after all these years
your mom still hates me.

174
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,758
- She doesn't hate you.
- She hates my mother.

175
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:48,962
- She doesn't trust unmarried women.
- You're unmarried.

176
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:52,369
I'm hayriding with a future proctologist.
I have potential.

177
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:56,968
Go upstairs. Tea is ready. I have muffins.
No dairy, no sugar, no wheat.

178
00:11:57,046 --> 00:12:00,014
You have to soak them in tea
to make them soft enough to bite...

179
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:01,548
but they're very healthy.

180
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,179
How was school?

181
00:12:04,252 --> 00:12:06,378
None of the girls get pregnant, drop out?

182
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,217
Not that we know of.

183
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:11,448
Though come to think of it,
Joanna Posner was glowing a little.

184
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:13,958
- What?
- Nothing, Mama. She's just kidding.

185
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:17,458
- Boys don't like funny girls.
- Noted.

186
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:19,988
Hello! Anybody here?

187
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,965
We're here. We're coming.

188
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,331
Have the muffins
made from sprouted wheat.

189
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:25,892
Only good 24 hour.

190
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,437
Everything's half off!

191
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:29,199
- Where are you?
- Over here!

192
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:31,104
- Where?
- By the chair!

193
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:32,539
What chair?

194
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,401
- Careful!
- I'm okay.

195
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:36,535
Peppers.

196
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:37,909
Mike.

197
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:42,348
Hello, little vegetables.
Come with me. I got it.

198
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:44,578
- Where's my glaze?
- In the counter.

199
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,916
On the counter. On, not in the counter.

200
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:49,285
Okay, good. All right.

201
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:52,324
My sauce. That's pretty good.

202
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,954
Hello. A little bit of green. Okay.

203
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:59,622
Hello, my little babies. You like that?

204
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:01,325
A little bit of juice.

205
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:04,234
You're very pretty. Okay.

206
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:12,667
It's here. It happened. She did it.

207
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,472
I'm gonna need a longer sentence.

208
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,876
The Chilton School. Rory got in.

209
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:20,008
- Oh, my God!
- I know. Look.

210
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,677
"We are happy to inform you we have
a vacancy at Chilton Preparatory..."

211
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:26,585
"starting immediately.
Due to Rory's excellent credentials..."

212
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,918
"and your enthusiastic pursuit
of her enrolment..."

213
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,924
I offered to do the principal to get her in.

214
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:34,860
"...we'd be happy to accept her once
the first semester's tuition is received."

215
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:36,793
This is very exciting.

216
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,661
- Is something burning?
- My bangs. Earlier. Go on.

217
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:44,865
She can finally go to Harvard
like she's always wanted...

218
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:48,269
get the education I never got,
and do all the things I never got to do.

219
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:49,672
Then I can resent her for it...

220
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:53,609
and we can finally have
a normal mother-daughter relationship.

221
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:55,571
Mom?

222
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:01,541
- You're happy.
- Yeah.

223
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,420
- Did you do something slutty?
- I'm not that happy.

224
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:08,583
Here.

225
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,682
- What's going on?
- Open it.

226
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:17,728
- I'm gonna be in a Britney Spears video?
- You're going to Chilton! Sorry.

227
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,856
Mom?

228
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:21,527
You did it, babe. You got in.

229
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,827
How did this happen?
You didn't with the principal, did you?

230
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,396
No. That was a joke.

231
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:30,136
They have an open spot.
You're gonna start on Monday.

232
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,802
- Really?
- Really.

233
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:35,310
I don't believe this.
My God, I'm going to Chilton?

234
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:37,680
Sookie, I'm going to Chilton!

235
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,241
I'll make cookies.
Protestants love oatmeal.

236
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,081
I have to call Lane.

237
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,620
- I love you.
- I love you.

238
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:51,583
My girl's going to Chilton.

239
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:53,960
Yeah, I know. Rory's going to Chilton!

240
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:15,039
Michel, the phone.

241
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:17,339
It rings.

242
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:20,546
- Can you answer it?
- No.

243
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:24,782
People are particularly stupid today.
I can't talk to any more of them.

244
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:30,016
You know who's really nice to talk to?
The people at the unemployment agency.

245
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:34,291
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

246
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:38,092
No, I'm sorry, we're completely booked.

247
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,588
I'm holding for Miss Bell.
I've been trying to get ahold of her all day.

248
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:44,459
Lorelai Gilmore.

249
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,763
Hi.

250
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:53,101
Yeah, my daughter Rory
has just been accepted.

251
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:55,300
Thank you.

252
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:58,574
And I got the invoice
for your enrolment fee.

253
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:02,072
That is a lot of zeroes behind that five.

254
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:07,643
Okay, I guess what I'm wondering is...

255
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:11,281
if you couldn't take, say, part of it now,
just to get her going?

256
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:17,694
But she's supposed to start Monday.

257
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:20,926
It just doesn't give me a lot of time
to pull a bank job.

258
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:24,098
Never mind. I was just kidding.

259
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:26,737
No, a bank job is robbing a bank, but...

260
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:36,170
No. I don't want you to give up her space.

261
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:39,474
I'll have to figure it out.

262
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:45,311
Okay. No, thank you.
It's been a real treat talking to you.

263
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:47,945
Yeah. Bye-bye.

264
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:00,022
What do I do?

265
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,930
You can have anything I own.
My car. Sell my car.

266
00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:05,766
Sweetie, no one wants your car.

267
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:08,798
There's something I haven't thought of.

268
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:12,502
There's something out there staring me
right in the face. I haven't seen it.

269
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:15,340
- You might consider calling...
- No.

270
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,005
- But I don't think you have...
- Stop.

271
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:18,513
You can at least go and...

272
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,745
Okay, can I say one more thing?
I think it's your only option.

273
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:25,685
There are several chapters
from a Stephen King novel I'd reenact...

274
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:27,723
before I'd resort to that option.

275
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,349
- Okay, dropped.
- Thank you.

276
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:33,117
Mom, so what do you think?

277
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,990
It makes you look smart.

278
00:17:35,063 --> 00:17:38,122
Okay, no more wine for you. Mom?

279
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,157
You look like you were swallowed
by a kilt.

280
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:43,760
Fine, you could hem it.

281
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:45,838
A little, only a little.

282
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,736
Okay. Or I could hem it a lot.

283
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:50,001
No, I don't want it to be too short.

284
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:52,839
I can't believe tomorrow's my last day
at Stars Hollow High.

285
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:53,935
I know.

286
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:56,776
- Today I was so excited, I dressed for gym.
- You're kidding!

287
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:59,782
- And I played volleyball.
- With other people?

288
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:02,717
And I learned all this time
I was avoiding group sports...

289
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:04,549
was very smart, because I suck at them.

290
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:06,179
You got that from me.

291
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,384
- Where's your pate?
- At Zsa Zsa Gabor's house.

292
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:11,052
I'm going to the store,
because you have nothing.

293
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:14,220
- Do you feel like duck?
- Lf it's made with chicken, absolutely.

294
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:16,264
- I'll be back.
- Bye.

295
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:19,859
All right, this will give you an idea.

296
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:23,165
- Go see how you like it.
- Okay.

297
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,272
I love being a private school girl.

298
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:10,805
Hi, Mom.

299
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:14,413
Lorelai! My goodness, this is a surprise.

300
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,572
Is it Easter already?

301
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,183
No, I just finished up my business class,
and I thought I would stop by.

302
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:22,981
- To see me?
- Yes.

303
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,313
Isn't that nice.

304
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:28,017
- Come in.
- Thanks.

305
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,657
- The place looks great.
- It hasn't changed.

306
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:38,535
There you go.

307
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:43,166
How are the girls at the bridge club?

308
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,466
Old.

309
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:47,802
Good.

310
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:56,148
You said you were taking
a business class?

311
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:59,980
Yeah. I'm taking a business class
at the college twice a week.

312
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:01,315
I'm sure I told you.

313
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:03,878
If you're sure, then you must have.

314
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:10,294
- Would you like some tea?
- I would love some coffee.

315
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:13,331
- Emily, I'm home.
- We're in here.

316
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,260
Hi, Dad.

317
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:18,935
What is it, Christmas already?

318
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,129
Lorelai was taking a business class
at the college today...

319
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,174
and decided to drop in to see us.

320
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:25,571
What business class?

321
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,770
- She told us about it, dear. Remember?
- No.

322
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:34,578
Actually, I came here for a reason.

323
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,914
Dad, would you mind sitting down
for a minute?

324
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,543
- You need money.
- I have a situation.

325
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,521
- You need money.
- Dad, just please let me get this out, okay?

326
00:20:44,926 --> 00:20:47,655
Rory has been accepted to Chilton.

327
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:51,822
Chilton? That's a wonderful school.

328
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:53,693
It's only five minutes from here.

329
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:57,201
That's right, it is.
She can start as early as Monday.

330
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,399
The problem is that they want me
to put down an enrolment fee...

331
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:03,337
plus the first semester's tuition.

332
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:06,467
I have to do that immediately
or she loses her spot.

333
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:08,769
So you need money.

334
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:11,138
Yeah.

335
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:15,345
But it's not for me, it's for Rory.

336
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,148
I intend to pay you back, every cent.
I don't ask for favors. You know that.

337
00:21:19,221 --> 00:21:21,086
Yes, we know.

338
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,251
I'll get the checkbook.

339
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:27,727
Thank you. You have no idea. Thank you.

340
00:21:28,063 --> 00:21:30,553
- On one condition.
- So close.

341
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,799
Since we are now financially involved
in your life...

342
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,926
I want to be actively involved in your life.

343
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:40,732
What does that mean, Mother?

344
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,501
- I want a weekly dinner.
- What?

345
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,073
Friday nights, you and Rory
will have dinner here.

346
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:48,168
Mom.

347
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:50,646
And you have to call us once a week...

348
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:53,615
to give us an update
on her schooling and your life.

349
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:56,812
That's it. That's the condition.

350
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:59,513
If you agree,
you'll come to dinner tomorrow night...

351
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:00,850
and leave here with the check.

352
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:03,915
Otherwise, I'm sorry, we can't help you.

353
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:10,723
I don't want her to know
that I borrowed money from you.

354
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,291
Can that just be between us?

355
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,300
Does 7:00 work for you?

356
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,198
Perfect.

357
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,778
And we get to wear uniforms.

358
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:39,645
No more people checking you out
to see what you're wearing...

359
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:43,209
'cause everyone's dressed alike
in boring clothes, just there to learn.

360
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:46,311
Okay, there's academic-minded,
and then there's Amish.

361
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,186
- Funny.
- Thank you.

362
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:51,654
- I told my mom you're changing schools.
- Was she thrilled?

363
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:54,218
The party's on Friday. I got to go.

364
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,158
I have to have a pre-hayride cup of tea
with a future doctor.

365
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,496
- How do I look, Korean?
- Spitting image.

366
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:02,558
- Good. Bye.
- Bye.

367
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:12,333
God!

368
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:16,645
You're like Ruth Gordon,
just standing there with the tannis root.

369
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:19,684
- Make a noise.
- Rosemary's Baby.

370
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:27,750
- Yeah.
- That's a great movie.

371
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:30,557
You've got good taste.

372
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:33,953
Are you moving?

373
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:36,228
No, just my books are.

374
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,699
My family just moved here from Chicago.

375
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:43,101
Chicago. Windy. Oprah.

376
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,162
Yeah, that's the place.

377
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,672
I'm Dean.

378
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:49,236
Hi.

379
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:53,836
Rory. Me. That's me.

380
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:58,742
- Lorelai, technically.
- Lorelai. I like that.

381
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,643
It's my mother's name, too.
She named me after herself.

382
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:05,316
She was in the hospital thinking about
how men name boys after themselves...

383
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:08,086
so why couldn't women?
She says her feminism took over.

384
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,594
Personally, I think a lot of Demerol
also went into that decision.

385
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:14,897
I never talk this much.

386
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:17,489
I better go.

387
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:20,399
- Sure.
- I have to go look for a job.

388
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:21,901
Okay, good.

389
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,438
- You should check with Miss Patty.
- What?

390
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:31,035
About the job.
You should check with Miss Patty.

391
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:33,910
She teaches dance.
She was actually on Broadway once.

392
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:36,915
I don't really dance much.

393
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:40,486
No, she just knows everything
that's going on in town.

394
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:42,846
She'll know if someone's looking.

395
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,358
Great. Thanks.

396
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:54,021
- What are you doing now?
- Nothing much.

397
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,032
I should throw this away at some point.

398
00:24:58,102 --> 00:25:01,194
Maybe you could show me
where this Miss Patty's place is.

399
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:04,898
Yeah, I guess so.
I really don't have anything important to...

400
00:25:05,408 --> 00:25:06,738
Let's go.

401
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:18,011
- Have you lived here all your life?
- Yes. Pretty much.

402
00:25:18,087 --> 00:25:20,815
- I was actually born in Hartford.
- That's not far.

403
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:23,047
- Thirty minutes with no traffic.
- Really?

404
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:25,147
- I timed it.
- Okay, then.

405
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,061
- Do you like cake?
- What?

406
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,991
They make really good cakes here.

407
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,332
They're very round.

408
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,268
Okay, I'll remember that.

409
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,534
Good. Make a note.

410
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:48,277
You wouldn't want to forget
where the round cakes are.

411
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:51,010
How are you liking Moby Dick?

412
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:52,843
- It's really good.
- Yeah?

413
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:55,349
- Yeah, it's my first Melville.
- Cool.

414
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:59,410
I know it's cliche to pick Moby Dick
as your first Melville, but...

415
00:26:00,522 --> 00:26:03,286
How did you know
I was reading Moby Dick?

416
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:07,592
- I've been watching you.
- Watching me?

417
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:12,064
Not in a creepy I'm-watching-you
sort of way. I've noticed you.

418
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:14,062
- Me?
- Yeah.

419
00:26:14,634 --> 00:26:15,760
When?

420
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:17,932
Every day.

421
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:22,730
After school, you come out
and sit under that tree, and you read.

422
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:26,299
Last week it was Madame Bovary.
This week it's Moby Dick.

423
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:30,104
- But why would you...
- Because you're nice to look at...

424
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,808
and because you've got
unbelievable concentration.

425
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:34,140
What?

426
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,412
Last Friday, two guys were tossing a ball...

427
00:26:36,486 --> 00:26:38,613
and one guy nailed the other
right in the face.

428
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:41,213
It was a mess. Blood everywhere,
the nurse came out...

429
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:44,691
the place was in chaos,
his girlfriend was freaking out...

430
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,922
and you just sat there and read.
You never even looked up.

431
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:52,864
I thought, "I've never seen anyone read
so intensely before in my entire life."

432
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:55,159
"I have to meet that girl."

433
00:26:55,903 --> 00:27:00,066
Maybe I just didn't look up
because I'm unbelievably self-centered.

434
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:02,864
Maybe, but I doubt it.

435
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:09,570
- Did I ask you if you like cake?
- Yeah, you did.

436
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:14,111
'Cause they have
really good cake back there.

437
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:28,355
You were late getting home tonight.

438
00:27:28,698 --> 00:27:30,927
Yeah, I went to the library.

439
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:36,627
We're having dinner
with the grandparents tomorrow night.

440
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:38,967
We are? But it's September.

441
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:41,967
- So?
- So what holiday is in September?

442
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:44,704
Look, it's not a holiday thing.
It's just dinner, okay?

443
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:46,210
Fine. Sorry.

444
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,680
Red meat can kill you. Enjoy.

445
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:01,483
I finished hemming your skirt today.

446
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:07,221
A grunt of acknowledgement
might be nice.

447
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:09,561
Why are we going to dinner
tomorrow night?

448
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:11,793
What if I had plans?
You didn't even ask me.

449
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:13,960
- Lf you had plans, I'd have known.
- How?

450
00:28:14,037 --> 00:28:15,435
You would've told me.

451
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,734
I don't tell you everything.
I have my own things.

452
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,934
- Fine, you have things.
- That's right. I have things.

453
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:24,341
- I had dibs on being the bitch tonight.
- Just tonight?

454
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,076
What the hell is wrong with you?

455
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:31,810
I'm not sure I want to go to Chilton.

456
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,879
- What?
- The timing is just really bad.

457
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:36,981
The timing is bad?

458
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:40,651
And the bus ride to and from Hartford,
it's 30 minutes each way.

459
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,726
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

460
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:45,456
I don't think we should be spending
that money right now.

461
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,760
I know Chilton's
got to be costing you a lot.

462
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,690
You've no idea.

463
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:52,495
Your money should be going
into buying an inn with Sookie.

464
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:54,559
What about college? What about Harvard?

465
00:28:54,638 --> 00:28:57,902
We don't know I can't get into Harvard
if I stay where I am.

466
00:28:58,408 --> 00:29:00,307
Enough of the crazy talk, okay?

467
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:03,674
I appreciate your concern,
but I have this covered.

468
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:05,974
- I still don't want to go.
- Why?

469
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:09,015
- Because I don't.
- I have to get out of here.

470
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:14,917
We have to pay first.

471
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:47,080
One, two, three. It's a waltz, ladies.
Susie, do you have to tinkle?

472
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:48,877
Then uncross your legs, darling.

473
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:52,476
Rory, I think I found a job
for your male friend.

474
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:54,315
What male friend?

475
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:56,220
They need a stock boy at the supermarket.

476
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,348
I already talked
to Taylor Doose about him.

477
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:00,017
Just send him around tomorrow.

478
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:02,822
- Okay, thanks.
- What male friend?

479
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,392
He's very cute. You have good taste.

480
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,229
Hands in the air, not in the nose.

481
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,663
You'll have to walk faster than that.

482
00:30:13,738 --> 00:30:16,968
You'll have to turn into frigging Flo Jo
to get away from me.

483
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,635
This is about a boy. Of course!

484
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:27,677
I can't believe I didn't see it.
All this talk about money and bus rides.

485
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,309
You've got a guy,
and you don't wanna leave school.

486
00:30:30,386 --> 00:30:32,319
- I'm going to bed.
- God, I'm so dense.

487
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:35,549
It should've been my first thought.
After all, you're me.

488
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,951
- I'm not you.
- Really?

489
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:41,427
Someone ready to throw important
life experiences out to be with a guy?

490
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:43,986
- It sounds like me to me.
- Whatever.

491
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:45,961
- Who is he?
- There's no guy.

492
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:48,728
Dark hair, romantic eyes,
looks a little dangerous?

493
00:30:48,802 --> 00:30:51,361
- This conversation's over.
- Tattoos are good, too.

494
00:30:51,438 --> 00:30:54,065
I don't wanna change schools
because of all the reasons...

495
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,834
I've already told you a thousand times.

496
00:30:55,908 --> 00:30:58,808
If you don't want to believe me,
that's fine. Goodnight.

497
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:00,434
Does he have a motorcycle?

498
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:04,345
If you're going to throw your life away,
he'd better have a motorcycle!

499
00:31:08,852 --> 00:31:11,945
- I think that went pretty well, don't you?
- Thanks for the knock.

500
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:14,421
Listen, can we just start all over, okay?

501
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:18,893
You tell me all about the guy,
and I promise not to let my head explode.

502
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:22,386
Rory, please talk to me.

503
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:25,726
Okay, I'll talk.

504
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,892
Don't get me wrong, guys are great.

505
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,936
I am a huge fan of guys.

506
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:33,830
You don't get knocked up at 16
being indifferent to guys.

507
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:37,271
Babe, guys are always gonna be there.
This school isn't.

508
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:40,506
It's more important.
It has to be more important.

509
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,674
I'm going to sleep.

510
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:48,709
You've always been the sensible one
in this house.

511
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:51,311
I need you to remember that feeling now.

512
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:54,288
You will kick your own butt later
if you blow this.

513
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:56,757
- It's my butt.
- Good comeback.

514
00:31:57,093 --> 00:31:59,755
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Rory, come on.

515
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:03,764
I don't want to talk about this.
Could you please just leave me alone?

516
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,561
Okay. Fine.

517
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,832
We've always had a democracy
in this house.

518
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:15,500
We never did anything
unless we both agreed.

519
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:19,033
But now I guess I'm gonna have to play
the mom card.

520
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:22,508
You are going to Chilton
whether you want to or not.

521
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:25,775
Monday morning, you will be there.
End of story.

522
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,878
- We'll see.
- Yeah, we will.

523
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,904
Okay. One, two...

524
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:03,074
- I swear I don't know what happened.
- It's not important.

525
00:33:03,144 --> 00:33:06,111
I've made that dish a hundred times.
It never exploded.

526
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,745
- Please forget it.
- God, I killed a Viking.

527
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:13,308
You should fire me
or make me pay the cost of a new stove...

528
00:33:13,385 --> 00:33:15,284
- out of my paycheck.
- Whatever you want.

529
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:17,913
I can't afford a new stove.
Those things are expensive.

530
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,516
Sookie, please, I am begging you,
pull yourself together.

531
00:33:21,594 --> 00:33:24,926
I got no sleep last night, and I think
I put my contacts in backwards.

532
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:28,825
- Rory's still mad at you?
- I'm not so crazy about her, either.

533
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,458
It was a fight.
Mothers and daughters fight.

534
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:34,128
No, we don't fight. We never fight.

535
00:33:34,203 --> 00:33:36,534
You told me to tell you
when your daughter arrived.

536
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:40,473
- She's here, and she's sitting in my chair.
- Hold on just a minute.

537
00:33:44,113 --> 00:33:46,273
And you are the one left standing.

538
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:48,815
Life is a funny thing, no?

539
00:33:51,652 --> 00:33:54,780
No muumuu today.
You know what's weird? I kind of miss it.

540
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:56,481
You left me a note to meet you here.

541
00:33:56,557 --> 00:34:00,390
I thought you might want to work
a couple hours, make a little extra cash.

542
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,427
- Fine.
- You're not gonna give me...

543
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:04,724
the Mommie Dearest treatment forever,
are you?

544
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:08,323
You wanted me here, I'm here.
Should I do something or what?

545
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,891
Yeah, go home. Dinner's at 7:00.
Be ready to go.

546
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,802
- Fine.
- Fine.

547
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:20,140
My chair.

548
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:36,919
Do we go in or do we just stand here
reenacting The Little Match Girl?

549
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,654
Look, I know we're having a thing here,
and I know you hate me...

550
00:34:43,729 --> 00:34:45,663
but be civil, at least through dinner...

551
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:48,824
and then on the way home
you can pull a Menendez. Deal?

552
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,192
Fine.

553
00:34:57,676 --> 00:35:00,109
- Hi, Grandma.
- You're right on time.

554
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:02,145
Yeah, no traffic at all.

555
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:07,506
I can't tell you what a treat it is
to have you girls here.

556
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:10,448
We're excited, too.

557
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:14,510
Is that a collector's cup,
or can I throw it away for you?

558
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,319
- In the kitchen, please.
- Sorry.

559
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:23,256
- I want to hear all about Chilton.
- I haven't actually started yet.

560
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:30,933
- Richard, look who's here.
- Rory.

561
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:34,903
- You're tall.
- I guess.

562
00:35:35,407 --> 00:35:37,397
- What's your height?
- 5'7".

563
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:40,841
- That's tall. She's tall.
- Hi, Dad.

564
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:44,946
- Lorelai, your daughter's tall.
- I know. It's freakish.

565
00:35:45,016 --> 00:35:47,415
We're thinking of having her
studied at MIT.

566
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:51,220
- Champagne, anyone?
- That's fancy.

567
00:35:51,854 --> 00:35:54,550
It's not every day
I have my girls here for dinner...

568
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:56,523
on a day the banks are open.

569
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:59,492
A toast: To Rory entering Chilton...

570
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:01,585
and an exciting new phase in her life.

571
00:36:01,997 --> 00:36:03,429
Hear, hear.

572
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,565
Let's sit, everyone.

573
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:12,136
This is just wonderful.

574
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:16,504
An education is the most important thing
in the world, next to family.

575
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:17,837
And pie.

576
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,204
Joke.

577
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:43,824
- Rory, how do you like the lamb?
- It's good.

578
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:46,025
- Too dry?
- No, it's perfect.

579
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:49,592
The potatoes could use
a little salt, though.

580
00:36:49,704 --> 00:36:51,068
Excuse me?

581
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:54,333
So, Grandpa, how's the insurance biz?

582
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:58,838
People die, we pay.
People crash cars, we pay.

583
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:03,075
- People lose a foot, we pay.
- At least you have your new slogan.

584
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:07,042
- How are things at the motel?
- The inn? They're great.

585
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:10,354
Lorelai's the executive manager now.
Isn't that wonderful?

586
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:13,115
Speaking of which,
Christopher called yesterday.

587
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:16,217
Speaking of which?
How is that a speaking of which?

588
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:18,124
He's doing very well in California.

589
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:20,355
His internet start-up
goes public next month.

590
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:23,695
This could mean big things for him.
Very talented man, your father.

591
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:26,825
- She knows.
- He always was a smart one, that boy.

592
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,228
You must take after him.

593
00:37:29,304 --> 00:37:33,535
Speaking of which,
I'm going to get a Coke. Or a knife.

594
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,224
Hi, how are you doing?

595
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:02,392
- I think I'm going to go talk to her.
- No. I'll go.

596
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,432
You stay
and keep your grandfather company.

597
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:11,564
Lorelai, come back to the table.

598
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,800
Is it going to be like this
every Friday night?

599
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:15,866
I come over
and let the two of you attack me?

600
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:17,809
- You're being very dramatic.
- Dramatic?

601
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,177
- Were you at that table just now?
- Yes, I was.

602
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:22,579
You took what your father said
the wrong way.

603
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,174
The wrong way?
How could I have taken it the wrong way?

604
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:27,811
- What was open to interpretation?
- Keep your voice down.

605
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,344
No, Mother. I can't take it anymore.
Tonight has been like a nightmare.

606
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:34,050
You're dripping all over the floor.

607
00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:36,185
Why do you pounce
on every single thing I say?

608
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:39,355
That's absurd.
You've barely uttered a word all night.

609
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:41,364
- That's not true.
- You said "pie."

610
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:43,696
- Come on.
- You did. All I heard you say was "pie."

611
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,293
Why bring up Christopher?
Was that really necessary?

612
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,735
- He likes Christopher.
- Isn't that interesting?

613
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:51,535
Because, as I remember,
when Christopher got me pregnant...

614
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:53,166
Dad didn't like him so much.

615
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:57,407
You were 16. What were we supposed
to do, throw you a party?

616
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,914
We were disappointed.
The two of you had such bright futures.

617
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:05,214
Yes. And by not getting married,
we got to keep those bright futures.

618
00:39:05,421 --> 00:39:09,856
When you get pregnant, you get married.
A child needs a mother and a father.

619
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,358
Do you think Christopher
would have his own company now...

620
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:15,895
if we were married?
You think he'd be anything at all?

621
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,827
Yes, I do. Your father would've put him...

622
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:21,298
in the insurance business,
and you'd be living a lovely life right now.

623
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,630
He didn't want
to be in the insurance business.

624
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:26,397
And I am living a lovely life right now.

625
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:29,234
- That's right. Far away from us.
- Here we go.

626
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:32,538
You took that girl
and completely shut us out of your life.

627
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,373
- You wanted to control me.
- You were still a child.

628
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:38,470
I stopped being a child
the minute the strip turned pink, okay?

629
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:41,710
I had to figure out how to live.
I found a good job.

630
00:39:41,784 --> 00:39:44,719
As a maid. With all your brains and talent.

631
00:39:44,787 --> 00:39:47,311
I worked my way up. I run the place now.

632
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,449
I built a life on my own
with no help from anyone.

633
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:54,084
Yes, and think of where you would've been
if you'd accepted a little help.

634
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,095
And where Rory would have been?

635
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:59,859
But no, you were always too proud
to accept anything from anyone.

636
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:03,197
I wasn't too proud to come here
to you two...

637
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,702
begging for money
for my kid's school, was I?

638
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:06,999
No, you certainly weren't.

639
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:10,599
But you're too proud to let her know
where you got it from, aren't you?

640
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:15,374
Fine, you have your precious pride,
and I have my weekly dinners.

641
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,207
Isn't that nice? We both win.

642
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:39,225
Mom?

643
00:40:40,268 --> 00:40:42,098
I'm okay. I just...

644
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:45,336
Do I look shorter? Because I feel shorter.

645
00:40:46,773 --> 00:40:49,332
How about I buy you a cup of coffee?

646
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:57,907
You drive, though, 'cause I don't think
my feet will reach the pedals.

647
00:40:59,618 --> 00:41:03,849
- Nice dinner at the grandparents' house.
- Yeah. Her dishes have never been cleaner.

648
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:06,616
You and Grandma
seemed to have a nice talk.

649
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,817
- How much did you hear?
- Not much.

650
00:41:08,892 --> 00:41:09,950
Snippets.

651
00:41:10,027 --> 00:41:11,960
- Little snippets.
- So basically everything?

652
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:14,724
- Basically, yes.
- The best-laid plans.

653
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,568
I think it was really brave of you
to ask them for money.

654
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:26,204
I so do not want to talk about it.

655
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:29,870
How many meals is it gonna take
till we're off the hook?

656
00:41:29,944 --> 00:41:33,640
I think the deli spread
at my funeral will be the last one.

657
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,718
Wait, does that mean...

658
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:43,346
Can't let a perfectly good plaid skirt
go to waste.

659
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:46,013
Honey, you won't be sorry.

660
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:54,426
You look nice. Really nice.

661
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:59,891
I had a meeting earlier at the bank.
They like collars.

662
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,366
You look nice, too.

663
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:05,236
I had a flagellation to go to.

664
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:09,240
- What'll you have?
- Coffee, in a vat.

665
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:13,740
I'll have coffee also. And chili fries.

666
00:42:14,482 --> 00:42:17,381
That's quite a refined palate you got there.

667
00:42:21,154 --> 00:42:23,748
Behold the healing powers of a bath.

668
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28,456
Tell me about the guy.

669
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:31,758
You know what's really special
about our relationship?

670
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:34,492
The total understanding about the need
for one's privacy.

671
00:42:34,566 --> 00:42:36,965
You really understand boundaries.

672
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:39,335
- So tell me about the guy.
- Mom!

673
00:42:39,403 --> 00:42:42,302
- Is he dreamy?
- That's so Nick at Nite.

674
00:42:42,405 --> 00:42:44,873
- I'm gonna find out anyway.
- Really? How?

675
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:46,870
I'll spy.

676
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:49,100
Coffee.

677
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:51,441
Fries.

678
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:56,808
I can't stand it. This is so unhealthy.
Rory, please, put down that cup of coffee.

679
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:59,408
You do not want to grow up
to be like your mom.

680
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:01,078
Sorry. Too late.

681
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:11,495
- Tell me about the guy.
- Check, please.

682
00:43:11,564 --> 00:43:14,532
- Are you embarrassed to bring him home?
- I'm not embarrassed.

683
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:17,533
- Does he talk at all?
- No, Mom, he's a mime.
