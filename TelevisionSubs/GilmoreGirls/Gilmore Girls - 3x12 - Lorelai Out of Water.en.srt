1
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:45,760
Well.

2
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:47,239
I�d say three years.

3
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:48,642
I�d say more like four.

4
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,172
What? It has not been four years

5
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:51,816
since we�ve stepped foot inside our own garage.

6
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:52,970
It was when we got the Jeep.

7
00:00:53,246 --> 00:00:55,150
That wasn�t... yes, it was.

8
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,279
And even then, I think we only got as far as opening the door

9
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,713
before something flew out and scared you.

10
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:01,019
Yes, it scared me while you stood by calmly

11
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,995
like Dr. Dolittle chatting with the bat.

12
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:04,260
It was a bat, wasn�t it?

13
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:06,098
Wearing an OzzFest T-shit, I believe.

14
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:07,959
Will the man never be able to live that down?

15
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:10,536
Joe Namath will forever be wearing pantyhose.

16
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:11,494
True, very true.

17
00:01:11,693 --> 00:01:13,905
So, what do we do about the bat cave?

18
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:16,435
We did promise Lane that her band could rehearse here.

19
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:17,317
Yes, we did.

20
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:19,759
And they�ll probably need to actually get in there to do so.

21
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:21,812
So I guess we�re going in.

22
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:22,671
I guess we are.

23
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:23,502
All right.

24
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:25,488
On three...

25
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:27,556
one, two,

26
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:29,436
three.

27
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:31,627
What, what is it?

28
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:33,168
Those are the boxes from our attic

29
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,222
that you were supposed to give away two years ago.

30
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:35,918
What?

31
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:38,484
I spent three days boxing all the stuff in the attic

32
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:40,660
and you were going to call a charity and get someone to pick �em up.

33
00:01:40,772 --> 00:01:42,386
I made an appointment, the guy didn�t show.

34
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:43,997
- He didn�t?
- No, I don�t think.

35
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:45,539
Unbelievable.

36
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:47,941
Look, I got bored after sitting there two hours,

37
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,204
so I left a note saying the stuff was in the garage

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,247
and he could leave a receipt, and I went to get some coffee.

39
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:55,032
These guys aren�t just allowed to go into someone�s garage.

40
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,455
The note said it was okay.

41
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:58,713
How did he know that the note was authentic?

42
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:00,639
I wrote it on Powerpuff Girls stationery.

43
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,089
Who�d he think was setting him up, Hello Kitty?

44
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:03,901
I can�t believe how much junk we have.

45
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:06,702
Hey, these are souvenirs from our life�s journey, girly girl.

46
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:08,586
This is not junk. Okay, this is junk,

47
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,188
and that over there is junk.

48
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:12,355
All right, basically everything I�m looking at is, yeah, junk.

49
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:13,455
We�re pack rats.

50
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:16,194
We�re Sanford and Son. Yuck, bye bye.

51
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,514
- Wait!
- What?

52
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:19,856
- Hug-a-World!
- What?

53
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:22,018
Hug-a-World, it�s my Hug-a-World.

54
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,777
- Where�s the world?
- It�s faded.

55
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:25,457
Oh, wait, I can see something.

56
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:26,311
Canada.

57
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:28,484
Canada, nice. Okay.

58
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:29,952
- What are you doing?
- I�m throwing it out.

59
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,014
You can�t throw out Hug-a-World.

60
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:33,640
I�m not throwing out Hug-a-World, I�m throwing out Hug-a-Canada.

61
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,998
I learned my seven continents on Hug-a-World, don�t you remember?

62
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:39,011
We used to squeeze it as tight as we could

63
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:40,717
and then wherever our pinkies would end up,

64
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,159
that�s where we were going to go together when I grew up.

65
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:45,703
Yes, many a trip to Uzbekistan was planned that way.

66
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,289
We can clean him up and keep him, can�t we?

67
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:48,878
Throw him outside and I�ll see what I can do.

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,635
Thank you.

69
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:51,930
If I clean up Hug-a-World,

70
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,696
does that cancel out me not getting rid of the boxers?

71
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,950
I�ll consider it a wash.

72
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,557
How about if I chase it and bring it back?

73
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,118
- What?
- Hug-a-World would like to see the world.

74
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:00,092
It�s moving.

75
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,124
There�s something living there besides Canadians.

76
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:03,726
I hugged it, I hugged it really tight.

77
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,223
- Yes, you did.
- I have to shower!

78
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:07,418
Hey, what about the rest of the garage?

79
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:08,402
Rory!

80
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:12,626
Hey, how �bout if Lane�s band rehearses in the kitchen?

81
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:13,778
We don�t use that either.

82
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:18,365
Can I take...

83
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,091
Can I take...

84
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:24,992
What can I get...

85
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:26,805
That�s it.

86
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:33,799
I specifically requested a carved arch above the door.

87
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:35,278
It�s a blueprint, Taylor.

88
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:36,979
Yes, Tom, I know it�s a blueprint.

89
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:38,567
- Taylor!
- One second, Luke.

90
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:41,535
I know it�s a blueprint, Tom, but if I don�t see a carved archway here,

91
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:43,805
then I don�t expect to see a carved archway there,

92
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,956
and if I don�t see an archway there,

93
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:47,026
then you won�t see a paycheck here. Are we clear?

94
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,715
Get away from my saw, Taylor.

95
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:51,019
What the hell is going on?

96
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:53,661
I�m renovating your building. You know that very well.

97
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,293
I also know that the renovation is supposed to be going on over there

98
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,095
inside the building.

99
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:00,732
There is plenty of room to move around if you turn sideways.

100
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:01,793
I�m gonna punch you in the nose.

101
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:04,005
I have every right to make the necessary renovations

102
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,917
to the building that I am paying good money to lease.

103
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,069
Taylor, if any other person in this town pulled a stunt

104
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,219
like this in front of your market, you�d have them arrested.

105
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:13,502
I have acquired all the necessary permits

106
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,956
to do exactly what I�m doing, and all of this

107
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:19,846
has been looked over and approved by the town magistrate.

108
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,097
You�re the town magistrate!

109
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:23,702
And as such, if you have any complaints about me,

110
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,084
you may take them up with me.

111
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:26,457
Get him away from my saw.

112
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:27,792
Get him away from my diner.

113
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,538
By the way, Luke, I noticed you hadn�t returned

114
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:31,660
any of my lawyer�s calls about the lease agreement.

115
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,272
Now we have to set up an appointment

116
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,018
to see that those papers get signed.

117
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:36,904
Forget it. I�m not going through any lawyer.

118
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,975
You want those papers signed, you pick them up and you walk them over to me.

119
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:42,172
- Then, I�ll sign them.
- Luke, this is business.

120
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:44,583
It needs to be done properly and legally.

121
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,563
It�s a standard lease form, Taylor. I bought it at Office Depot.

122
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:50,691
All the more reason to have a professional take a little looksee, huh?

123
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:53,058
I mean, there�s a reason they say good lawyers

124
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:55,280
- make for good neighbors.
- Who the hell said that?

125
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:57,030
Oh, everybody says that.

126
00:05:57,405 --> 00:05:58,849
Okay, now back to work.

127
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,833
Tom, let�s take another look at this archway, shall we?

128
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,692
Get away from my saw, Taylor.

129
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:09,924
I already talked to the neighbors.

130
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,704
Just make sure you keep the doors closed, and the music must stop by eight.

131
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:14,209
Don�t worry, I have to be home by six.

132
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,887
We�ll be done by eight, don�t you worry.

133
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:18,014
I won�t.

134
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,945
Okay, okay, okay,

135
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:21,900
Lorelai, okay.

136
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:24,715
So, Rory showed you the key.

137
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:27,388
You�re welcome to anything in the kitchen, which is nothing,

138
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,872
but the water�s yours for the taking. Just replace the bottle if it�s out.

139
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,417
You ask, I will obey.

140
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:33,611
- Super.
- I�m out!

141
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,146
He�s out! I�ll get you some more!

142
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:36,493
Oh, no, no, don�t worry about it. I�ll get it.

143
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,011
Oh, excuse me. Do you need any help?

144
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:40,728
No.

145
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,737
Do you need any help, please?

146
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:43,043
I�m good, Pamela Des Barres.

147
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:43,963
When did you turn on Mommy?

148
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:45,536
- What? He�s cute.
- Rory.

149
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:47,061
And you know, if you latch on now,

150
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:49,775
you�re totally entitled to half of everything when he dumps you after he�s famous.

151
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:52,412
Okay, since you don�t need any help,

152
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,676
simply a new place to live, I�m gonna just go.

153
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:56,969
- Listen... 
- You�re back, okay, hi.

154
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:59,175
We�re gonna be playing a gig next month,

155
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,666
and I think you�d really get into it.

156
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:02,187
Oh, well,

157
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,814
I�d love to get into it, Zach, but see,

158
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,149
I have this medical condition

159
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:09,111
where I can�t listen to music.

160
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:09,867
You can�t?

161
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:14,127
No. My ears, the hollow tubey thing inside

162
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:17,296
is very tiny and it will literally explode

163
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,483
if I listen to anything loud and musical.

164
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:21,066
- That sucks.
- I know.

165
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:23,502
Thanks for the invite, I�m sure it�s gonna be great.

166
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:26,872
So, you guys have a good rehearsal.

167
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:29,427
I�m gonna go on inside and write to Tipper.

168
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:30,881
Great gal. See you guys later.

169
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:31,731
Bye Pam.

170
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:33,323
She is some kind of fine.

171
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:34,952
Zach, some help would be great.

172
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:35,981
Relax.

173
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:38,387
I still can�t believe you guys are letting us rehearse here.

174
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:39,750
You can thank us in the liner notes.

175
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,002
Right under our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

176
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:43,001
That�s some good billing.

177
00:07:43,216 --> 00:07:45,248
So, are you guys actually playing a gig next month?

178
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:46,677
Abby Berland�s birthday party.

179
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,953
Her parents are letting her have a band.

180
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:48,884
That�d be great.

181
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:50,686
Cross your fingers she doesn�t wreck the car again

182
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:52,514
and her mother doesn�t cancel it before we get to play.

183
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:53,616
I�ll hide the keys myself.

184
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:54,813
Okay, I�m done.

185
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:56,488
- Me too.
- Let�s do this.

186
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,113
Listen, Lane, we need to talk a sec.

187
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:00,830
Sure.

188
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:03,160
Now that we finally have a real rehearsal space,

189
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,813
we can get serious about the sound.

190
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:05,458
Absolutely.

191
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:07,809
Which means that I�m gonna need you to really step it up a little.

192
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,435
I mean, you�ve got the potential, but you�re sloppy.

193
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:13,128
I need a clean roll on the toms but powerful, like Moon.

194
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:15,751
I know you�re a girl, but I need you to play like a guy.

195
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:17,972
- I understand.
- And if you can�t, if that�s too hard...

196
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:19,816
No, that�s not too hard. I�ll be better, I promise.

197
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,714
Okay, please take this the way it�s intended,

198
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:27,271
but I am going to kick Dave

199
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,094
in the shins repeatedly for the next hour and a half.

200
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:30,527
- Why?
- Why?

201
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:32,530
Did you hear the way he was talking to you?

202
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,842
"Play like a guy, Lane." Well, cry like a girl, Dave!

203
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,254
What? Why are you smiling like that?

204
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,077
- He fooled you.
- What?

205
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,558
We thought the other guys might be catching on about me and Dave 

206
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,034
so we came up with this plan.

207
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:46,196
That he become a jerk?

208
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:49,263
Yes. If the other guys see him talking down to me like that,

209
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,809
they will totally be thrown off track.

210
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,165
Okay, but doesn�t it bother you to hear him talk to you like that?

211
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,669
No way. Believe me, he knows I play better, harder, Moonier

212
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,114
than any guy they could possibly find, plus I smell better.

213
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:00,584
Okay, as long as you�re fine with it.

214
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:01,720
I am, I�m fine with it.

215
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:04,086
And also Lane, I need four strong downbeats,

216
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,211
not two strong ones and two whatever ones.

217
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,602
You set the tone, Lane. If you suck, we suck.

218
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:11,971
God, he�s wonderful.

219
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,152
Okay, now this is the Sumatra blend.

220
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,544
It�s supposed to be a little sharper than the Colombian.

221
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:22,458
You know, this is pretty much

222
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,127
what I thought heaven would look like.

223
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:26,140
There might have been a unicorn in the corner,

224
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:28,095
but basically � yeah, this is it.

225
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:33,106
So I�ve had fifteen of these tiny coffees.

226
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:34,049
Yes, you have.

227
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:36,922
And you�re telling me that all this tasting is completely free?

228
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,275
- Yes.
- So I�m a cheap date.

229
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,912
Well, the tasting is free,

230
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:42,791
but I have to promise to stock my coffee chain from this warehouse,

231
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:45,187
so actually this date is costing me about eleven thousand dollars a month.

232
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,549
Geez, I hope I�m worth it.

233
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:47,618
So far, so good.

234
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,599
So you were telling me about Hillary and Jeff.

235
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,664
Right. Well, they live with their mom,

236
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,010
but I get them quite a bit.

237
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:56,702
They both recently started soccer because apparently it�s the law.

238
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,297
I know. Rory�s still got an outstanding warrant on that one.

239
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,978
- So, how old are they?
- Six and nine.

240
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:01,915
Good ages.

241
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:03,871
Haven�t really hit a bad one yet.

242
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:06,836
Me either. Although, with Rory, I think it�s gonna be forty-three.

243
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:08,459
- Really?
- Not sure why,

244
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,809
just have a feeling that�s the year she�s getting the mohawk

245
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,575
We like sharper.

246
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:16,038
When you guys open your coffee place, this must be on the menu.

247
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,681
Yeah?

248
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,407
That�s sharper.

249
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:22,576
So, let�s see, we�ve covered work, kids...

250
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,562
shall we move onto hobbies?

251
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:26,462
- Not a hobby guy.
- Hallelujah.

252
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:27,609
Most of the time I�m working,

253
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,700
with the kids, or I�m charming the chicks with the coffee.

254
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,353
And then a few times a year, I�ll go camping or fishing.

255
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,626
- I actually really love that stuff.
- Oh yeah?

256
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,040
Absolutely. How about you?

257
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:39,779
Ah, there�s a reason they call it the great outdoors, right?

258
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:42,438
I was actually thinking of doing a little fishing this Saturday.

259
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:43,681
Oh, that sounds like fun.

260
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:46,713
This great place, beautiful, perfect fishing. You wanna come?

261
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,509
I�d love to take you.

262
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:50,492
Oh, yeah, sure.

263
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,371
That would be nice.

264
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,517
Great, it�s a date.

265
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,288
Yes, it is a date. It is a fishing date.

266
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:58,341
Ready to try another?

267
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:01,336
I hear there�s one from Peru that comes with a Surgeon�s General warning.

268
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:03,165
Hey, if that last one didn�t kill me, nothing will.

269
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:04,363
Be right back.

270
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:14,193
Rory! Rory!

271
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,872
The numbers are all adding up,

272
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,934
the planets are aligning, and I am going to my senior prom!

273
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:20,030
- What?
- Yes!

274
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,079
- How?
- Because I am brilliant.

275
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:24,209
See, my mom was in a good mood today

276
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:25,376
because she made a big sale �

277
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:28,034
a dining room table and eight chairs, none of which matched,

278
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:29,790
that have been hanging around the shop since I was four.

279
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:30,905
Oh, I�m gonna miss those.

280
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,215
Get over it. Anyway, I sat her down

281
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,626
and I told her that I really wanted to go to the prom.

282
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:37,583
And I know she doesn�t approve of such things,

283
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:39,908
but if she lets me go, we will do it her way.

284
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,787
But her way would be not to let you go.

285
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,358
Yes, she said that also.

286
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:46,594
But then I went on to clarify that if she lets me go,

287
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:49,052
she would get full dress approval, full chaperone approval,

288
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:51,045
I promise not to actually dance at the prom,

289
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:53,219
and whatever boy I go with will be required

290
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:54,808
to attend at least four family dinners

291
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,718
before she signs off on him being my escort.

292
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,323
Nice move on using the word escort instead of the word date.

293
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,025
The subliminal is half the battle, Rory.

294
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:01,889
Go on, go on.

295
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:05,616
So, she sat there, took it all in, and after a really long pause,

296
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:08,202
she looks at me and says, "Maybe."

297
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:11,250
You got a maybe from Mrs. Kim.

298
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:13,368
I got a maybe from Mrs. Kim.

299
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:18,586
Okay, let�s start with base.

300
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:21,536
Right. Now, we are talking Dave taking you to the prom, right?

301
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:23,292
Of course. My mom loves him.

302
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:25,043
Last week she let him sit in our pew.

303
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:26,499
- No.
- She made me move.

304
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,388
You�ve been replaced.

305
00:12:27,443 --> 00:12:29,692
I�d be offended if I weren�t so busy doing a happy dance.

306
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,579
It�s all working out so perfectly.

307
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:34,234
By the time she says yes,

308
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,573
she�ll love him even more and then when I say I wanna go

309
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,703
to the prom with him, it�ll be like she picked him out herself.

310
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:41,879
You are brilliant. Hey, Kirk, is this waterproof?

311
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,973
- Water-resistant.
- Thanks.

312
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:46,323
You know, she asked Dave to play at the wedding this weekend.

313
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,944
I thought I was the only non-Korean allowed at the Kim family weddings.

314
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:51,141
Don�t be hurt. You have been to so many of these weddings,

315
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,790
you are an honorary member of the clan now.

316
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,829
I appreciate that.

317
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:57,064
So, tell me, your cousin getting married Saturday, what�s his story?

318
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:59,733
James. Very quiet, kind of skulky,

319
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,745
couldn�t meet anyone here, so his family arranged

320
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,665
to have a girl shipped over from the old country.

321
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:05,156
I hope they cut air holes in the box.

322
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,822
She doesn�t speak a word of English and she�s never met him.

323
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:09,877
Then she�s gonna need some sparkles.

324
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:11,099
Okay, I think that�s it.

325
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,986
Let�s go.

326
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:14,552
Can you imagine marrying someone you didn�t know?

327
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:17,174
Are you kidding? Used clothes still skeeve me out a little.

328
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:18,279
Will this be all?

329
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,385
Yes. I like your display Kirk.

330
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:21,449
It is fun, isn�t it?

331
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:24,379
Okay, that�s $40.42.

332
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:25,612
Here.

333
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:28,931
I�m also including a few samples,

334
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:30,912
a facial scrub and a honey mask.

335
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:32,673
Very soothing, very healing.

336
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:33,558
That�s very nice.

337
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:35,524
Thank you for coming,

338
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:39,115
and call me and tell me how you like that mask.

339
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:39,873
We will.

340
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:44,261
Okay, the wedding�s at four,

341
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,072
so how about you come over at one and we�ll get her ready?

342
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,712
Deal.

343
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:48,418
You know, Rory, I feel good.

344
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,139
I feel like everything�s going my way this time.

345
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:50,900
I hope so.

346
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:53,427
No, it is, I can feel it. Lane Kim is going to her prom.

347
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:54,126
Maybe.

348
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:57,635
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

349
00:13:57,722 --> 00:13:59,380
- Oh, come on.
- Sure, I fish.

350
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:01,929
I also bodysurf and walk on the moon without a space suit.

351
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:03,738
You were trying to impress him.

352
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:05,688
What ugh? You like him.

353
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,941
I like him, but I�m not sixteen.

354
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:09,463
I don�t lie to guys to make them like me.

355
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,506
I just got stuck when he said fishing and camping,

356
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,357
and I was trying to be nice and not say, "Fishing?

357
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,939
Great � cold, wet, and smelly.

358
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,361
My three favorite things after those witches from Macbeth."

359
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:19,996
Honey, we all do it.

360
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,869
When Jackson and I first started dating,

361
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,340
we went to this pickling festival, and he wore a shirt with a giant frog on it.

362
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:28,372
So I�m trying to make conversation and I say, "Hey, cute frog."

363
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,575
And he says, "You like frogs?"

364
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,265
and I say, "I love frogs!"

365
00:14:31,356 --> 00:14:34,608
So, for our six-month anniversary, he gives me a frog figurine.

366
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,906
And then when Christmas came, he gave me another frog figurine.

367
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:40,768
And then he told his family what to get me, and all of a sudden...

368
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,652
- Your frog collection!
- I�m the frog girl.

369
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,608
You never told him you don�t love frogs?

370
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:47,060
No. He has the best time buying them for me,

371
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,300
so I just let him buy them.

372
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:49,451
That�s sweet.

373
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,087
Maybe I could go fishing. Maybe. Once.

374
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,127
Tell me about Alex.

375
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,026
Well, he owns an iron company.

376
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:58,751
They do gates and statues, big fancy stuff.

377
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,932
He�s divorced, he has two kids he�s crazy about.

378
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,698
He�s nice, he drinks a lot of coffee.

379
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:04,210
It�s all good, it all works.

380
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:05,054
So?

381
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,437
So... I�m going fishing.

382
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:09,723
I�m the fish girl.

383
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,201
Frog girl welcomes you to the club!

384
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,212
I don�t know what to do. It�s time to break up, but he seems so happy.

385
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,195
You could date his brother.

386
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:21,004
I guess, but that�s so �been there, done that.�

387
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,929
- We could switch.
- Isn�t that how I got him?

388
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:26,015
Oh yeah. Wow, it really is time to go to college.

389
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:27,730
- Rory, where is Paris?
- I don�t know.

390
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,473
- She�s almost fifteen minutes late.
- Is she?

391
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,495
All right. Well, perhaps we should start without her.

392
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:32,862
You can convene the meeting.

393
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:37,182
If everyone will take their seats, we can call this meeting to order.

394
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,795
- All right, since Paris isn�t here... 
- Paris is here.

395
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,191
Couldn�t wait to jump in there and take over, could you?

396
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:43,554
Tell it to the Timex salesman.

397
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,429
My gavel, please?

398
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:47,730
I call this meeting to order.

399
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,128
I already did that.

400
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:52,212
Sorry I�m late, but I had some very important business to attend to.

401
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,355
Business which I must now, unfortunately, share with all of you.

402
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:57,522
At the beginning of this year, when we were sworn in

403
00:15:57,602 --> 00:16:00,481
as your government representatives, we placed our hand on a bible

404
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:02,569
and we took an oath. An oath that stated

405
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:05,141
that our behavior would be ethically and morally upstanding

406
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:07,275
for as long as we were serving in public office.

407
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:10,194
And that is why it saddens me greatly today to inform you

408
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:12,642
that one of our own has forsaken that holy oath.

409
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:14,347
I hate anything that starts with a speech.

410
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:15,710
What are you talking about, Paris?

411
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:18,741
I hold in my hand evidence accusing one Rory Gilmore

412
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:20,641
of committing high crimes and misdemeanors.

413
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,335
- What?
- Paris, what�s going on here?

414
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:25,110
Miss Gilmore has been conspiring with the various factions

415
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:27,670
of this school to weaken the efficacy of this administration.

416
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,159
You�re really pathetic, you know that?

417
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:31,418
You�ll have your chance to address these charges when I�m done.

418
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,356
What charges?

419
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,055
First on the list, espionage.

420
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:35,237
Espionage?

421
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:37,905
Gathering privileged information and divulging it to the enemy.

422
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:39,221
What privileged information?

423
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,075
Prom colors are green and pink, pass it on?

424
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:43,850
Next on our list, the most serious crime � treason.

425
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,724
I�m sorry I talked about Jamie.

426
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:47,798
And having a big mouth. That�s going on the list also.

427
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:49,595
I can�t believe you�re taking all of this out on me.

428
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:50,523
What about Francie?

429
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:52,084
Francie was not my second in command.

430
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:54,899
Francie was not privy to the innermost workings of my personal life.

431
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:56,769
That is, not until you made her privy.

432
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:58,730
Everyone in school saw you walking with Jamie, Paris.

433
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,408
- I�m still talking.
- She already knew!

434
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:01,131
Enough!

435
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:02,304
We�ve heard enough.

436
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:04,583
I move to put to a vote the impeachment of Rory Gilmore.

437
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:06,436
Miss Gellar, I�m sorry,

438
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:08,130
but we do not impeach here at Chilton.

439
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,046
- Why not?
- Because this is a student government.

440
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,150
Well, then, I�d like to put to a vote a resolution

441
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:14,157
to instate the ability to impeach.

442
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,488
- No.
- Then she should resign.

443
00:17:15,663 --> 00:17:17,978
I�m not going to resign. You have the problem, you resign.

444
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,135
- No, you resign!
- No, you resign!

445
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,710
- No, you resign!
- No one is resigning.

446
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:24,614
Maybe I�ll stay with him �til Friday and see how it goes.

447
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:25,724
That sounds fair.

448
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:27,527
You two can take this argument somewhere else.

449
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,755
This is student council.

450
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,525
Real school matters are the only things that matter here.

451
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:33,718
Now, Paris, move on.

452
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,650
The swimming pool needs re-plastering.

453
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,699
Ideas for fundraising, please.

454
00:17:46,575 --> 00:17:47,221
Excuse me?

455
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,318
Hi, I�m looking for a Mr. Lucas Danes.

456
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:51,526
- Oh, Lucas. 
- What?

457
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,519
IRS.

458
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,330
I�m not IRS. I�m not IRS.

459
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:57,594
- I�m Luke Danes.
- Luke Danes, sorry.

460
00:17:57,936 --> 00:18:01,107
Hello Luke Danes, I�m Nicole Leahy, I�m Taylor Doose�s attorney.

461
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:02,380
Oh, geez.

462
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,171
- He wanted me to bring... 
- Yeah, the lease agreements, yes, I know.

463
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:06,734
I told him to walk them over here,

464
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:09,042
but hey, what�s the fun of being Taylor, right?

465
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:12,243
I�m sorry if this is a bad time. It certainly won�t take me very long.

466
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,343
I�m fine, whatever. Let�s get this over with.

467
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:15,832
- No problem.
- You want some coffee?

468
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,132
Yeah, sounds great.

469
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:22,806
I really just need to witness your signature, is all. It�s actually just a formality.

470
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:25,826
In other words, completely ridiculous and unnecessary.

471
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:29,984
Mr. Doose really likes things to be formal.

472
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:32,509
And neat. And in triplicate.

473
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,291
He just loves things in triplicate.

474
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:38,329
That�s a really good cup of coffee.

475
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,227
Thanks.

476
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:44,225
So, tell me something, what�s it like being Taylor�s lawyer?

477
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:47,307
Well, actually, I�m not exactly Mr. Doose�s lawyer.

478
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,437
Or only lawyer. He�s one of our select clients,

479
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:52,167
so all of our attorneys deal with him or a rotating basis, it�s my month.

480
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:53,344
My condolences.

481
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,590
Yeah, my father always told me that which does not kill you makes you stronger.

482
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:58,183
You�re gonna be really stronger.

483
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,405
He�s not that bad.

484
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:02,161
Seriously, if you run into someone pinned underneath a truck, pick it up.

485
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,589
It�s gonna be a piece of cake.

486
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,631
Okay, looks like that�s the whole nine yards.

487
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:09,857
Great. You and Mr. Doose are officially in business together.

488
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:12,447
Oh, I�m so sorry, I meant that as a good thing.

489
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:13,221
It�s okay.

490
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:15,714
I will let you get back to work. Let me...

491
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,675
No, no, on me.

492
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:21,470
Tell you what. It�s business, let�s let Mr. Doose pay for it.

493
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:22,560
Even better.

494
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:28,996
That was an interesting show.

495
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,236
What are you yammering about?

496
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,844
Guess Gloria Allred wants to go slumming.

497
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:32,648
Shut up.

498
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,663
- She was totally coming onto you.
- She was not.

499
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,005
Couldn�t you hear her panting when you were signing those things?

500
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:37,803
Didn�t see it.

501
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:39,047
She laughed at your jokes,

502
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:41,086
and we both know there�s gotta be some ulterior motive

503
00:19:41,172 --> 00:19:42,279
when people laugh at your jokes.

504
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:43,990
Okay, whatever. Even if there was something,

505
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:47,045
which I�m not saying there was, she�s a suit. Not my type.

506
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:49,196
Yeah, especially since she�s not a monk.

507
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,639
Oh, I don�t go out that much, is that what that�s supposed to mean?

508
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:53,701
Take a look at a calendar. When was the last time you went out on a date?

509
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:55,955
- A year, two years ago?
- Last month, wiseass.

510
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:58,510
- I went out with Joanna Cooper.
- You gave her a ride home.

511
00:19:58,576 --> 00:19:59,986
A ride home is the end of a date.

512
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:02,366
- Only if you go on a date first.
- I�m not gonna discuss this with you.

513
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,608
Suit yourself. I have to go meet Rory anyhow.

514
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:06,548
See, I�m gonna go pick her up,

515
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:09,298
spend a few hours actually being with her, then give her a ride home.

516
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,794
That�s called the end of a date.

517
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:13,692
Or I could stay open a few hours later which means you�re here �til ten.

518
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,693
That�s also called the end of a date.

519
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,092
- Hopeless.
- Bye now.

520
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:33,241
Hey, got any good stories?

521
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:35,412
Nope, sorry.

522
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,692
Ah, nothing?

523
00:20:36,923 --> 00:20:38,736
No crazy, colorful uncle?

524
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,610
- Best friend with a funny name?
- Jeff Smith?

525
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,214
Skeletons in the family closet? War wounds?

526
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:45,550
Funny shaped scars?

527
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,905
It really throws you off when Rory�s late, doesn�t it?

528
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:48,930
Big time.

529
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,730
Oh, yay, thank God!

530
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,752
Sorry. Didn�t Luke keep you company?

531
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,248
Oh, he tried, but really, he�s got nothing.

532
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:56,058
Thank you.

533
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,008
So what�s with all the books?

534
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,094
We are going to fish.

535
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,594
- With these?
- Yes.

536
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:04,480
So we throw them in and try to knock the fish out?

537
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:07,164
I went to the library and got of all their best informational books on fishing.

538
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,342
You�re serious.

539
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:09,488
You wanna learn to fish or not?

540
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:10,880
Exciting, huh?

541
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,483
Oh, I can barely keep still.

542
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:15,600
Chapter 1, technique. For deep water fishing, an angler �

543
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:17,368
- What�s an angler?
- That would be you.

544
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,848
Oh, better remember that. Okay.

545
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:21,183
For deep water fishing, an angler � me, again �

546
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,470
can choose a wire line using a downrigger or a vertical jig.

547
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:27,225
Whatever your technique, the other successful clue to attracting fish

548
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,694
is the appropriate lure.

549
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:31,618
Ooh, what about the sequined top I wore to the Christmas party?

550
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:33,589
Yes, I think that�s exactly what he�s talking about.

551
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:36,543
For bottom feeders, consider smaller, darker patterned lures

552
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,703
� simple, yet elegant � while in areas where the forage fish are cicso,

553
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,807
you�re limited to the larger, more flashy baits.

554
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:45,863
I am telling you right now, the larger flashy baits are just gonna make me look cheap.

555
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,640
Okay, let�s review � what do we know so far?

556
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:50,891
I need flashy baits if I�m going to invest in cisco,

557
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,721
unless I choose to cast a troll in my downrigger.

558
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:55,631
Hey, that�s good.

559
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:56,962
Doing a little studying?

560
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:58,392
My mom�s leaning how to fish.

561
00:21:58,602 --> 00:22:00,210
- You�re what?
- I�m learning how to fish.

562
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,519
Oh, sorry, wrong inflection � you�re what?

563
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:03,261
Go away.

564
00:22:03,374 --> 00:22:04,746
Why are you learning how to fish?

565
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,077
It�s just something I wanted to do.

566
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:09,292
Some friends of mine fish, and I thought if they can do it I can do it.

567
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:12,099
And what if I am a really great fisher?

568
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,224
Yeah, I mean, what if that�s my calling,

569
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:15,453
the thing that I am meant to do?

570
00:22:15,678 --> 00:22:18,397
And all this time I�ve been sitting here with the gift to fish

571
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,707
and I am squandering it.

572
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,729
It�s like if Mozart walked right by the piano store

573
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:23,896
and never played a note.

574
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:25,720
So you�re gonna fish to fulfill your destiny?

575
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:26,379
That�s right.

576
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:29,555
And you�re gonna learn to fish to fulfill your destiny from a book?

577
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:30,118
Yes.

578
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,192
- And you sanctioned this?
- Yes.

579
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:33,984
Okay, Thelma, Louise, possibly there�s another way to learn to fish.

580
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:36,150
- The Fishing Channel.
- I fish.

581
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:39,575
Oh yeah, we�ve seen those boots thingies outside drying off.

582
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:41,100
Those would be called waders.

583
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:43,902
And I�m sure I�ll be reading about waders soon in one of these cliffhangers here.

584
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,600
If you want, I can show you a few things, get you started,

585
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:50,318
make sure you don�t strangle yourself with your own line, the basics.

586
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,423
Are you sure you don�t mind?

587
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,713
I can come over tomorrow after work.

588
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:53,875
Great, thank you.

589
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,726
Just for the record, I don�t wanna learn that.

590
00:22:57,849 --> 00:22:58,479
Got it.

591
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,680
I got a note that I was supposed to come see Headmaster Charleston.

592
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:09,210
I�ll let him know you�re both here.

593
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:10,660
- Both? 
- Both.

594
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:12,868
Both.

595
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,235
- Take a seat, please.
- Yes, ma�am.

596
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:18,923
So what this time, trying to have me deported?

597
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:20,855
Oh, yeah, like I�m the one who called this meeting.

598
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,196
I certainly didn�t call this meeting.

599
00:23:22,314 --> 00:23:24,055
Save the act for Sundance, you little snitch.

600
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:24,982
I didn�t snitch.

601
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,425
Said the weak-kneed turncoat.

602
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,796
- Nixon�s bad seed.
- Daughter of Judas.

603
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:32,632
Ladies, come in please.

604
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:36,758
Have a seat.

605
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:43,584
Chilton student council president and vice president in my office...

606
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:46,083
not what I would�ve expected, I must tell you.

607
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:49,425
There�s been quite a stir about you two the past several days.

608
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:53,610
The school is buzzing with the talk of your clashes in student council meetings,

609
00:23:53,738 --> 00:23:55,572
your face-offs in the cafeteria,

610
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:58,059
a screaming match at the school newspaper�s office.

611
00:23:58,177 --> 00:23:59,569
Excuse me, Headmaster Charleston,

612
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,603
in regards to the incident at the Franklin,

613
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,101
Ms. Gilmore submitted a piece that was quite poorly researched.

614
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:05,734
- It was not poorly researched.
- I had to re-edit it

615
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:08,473
- and Ms. Gilmore took it very badly.
- There was nothing wrong with the piece.

616
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,194
And in regards to the student council meeting...

617
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,249
Oh, you mean the one where you tried to impeach me

618
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,251
because you haven�t been properly diagnosed yet?

619
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,749
If you�ll just allow me access to my briefs...

620
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,245
You know what, you want me to quit?

621
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:20,680
Fine, I�ll quit. I never wanted this stupid job in the first place.

622
00:24:20,774 --> 00:24:21,829
Who forced you to take it then?

623
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:24,737
You did, because you didn�t think you�d get elected unless I ran with you.

624
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,416
- That�s not true!
- It�s completely true!

625
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,501
- Shut up!
- No, you shut up!

626
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:30,251
Enough! This behavior will stop this instant.

627
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:33,799
It is disgraceful, especially from the political leaders of this campus.

628
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:37,547
Now, I�d like to know what is actually driving this recent rash of infighting.

629
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:41,679
Oh, goody, I get to guess.

630
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:45,197
Let�s see, perhaps you�re arguing over the same boy?

631
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,782
Sure, we�re girls, so we could only be arguing about a boy, right?

632
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:50,533
Sexist, white-haired...

633
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,138
- Paris, are you muttering?
- No, sorry.

634
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:56,303
All right, if it isn�t a boy, perhaps it�s a popularity thing.

635
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,381
Someone didn�t get invited to someone else�s party?

636
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:01,817
Or perhaps this is a power struggle of some sort.

637
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,214
No? Well, then I�ll stop guessing and start lecturing.

638
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:09,631
Ms. Gilmore, you will not be quitting the student council, is that clear?

639
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:11,475
Yes, sir.

640
00:25:11,572 --> 00:25:12,786
The student body has elected you

641
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:14,639
and therefore you will fulfill your commitment.

642
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:17,757
And in the future, I would advise you to think long and hard

643
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:20,082
about accepting any responsibility if you intend to run away

644
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:21,859
from it at the first sign of conflict.

645
00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:25,922
And Ms. Gellar, you worked very hard to get to the position you hold in this school,

646
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:29,257
and yet now you are willing to throw all that away on petty vendettas

647
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,447
and childish antics. Indeed, it makes me wonder...

648
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:35,069
if you two can�t resolve your issues in this sheltered

649
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,605
� some would say pampered � environment,

650
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:39,908
how on Earth will you ever survive in college?

651
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,708
As student council officers, you represent Chilton

652
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:45,376
to those inside and outside these hallowed halls.

653
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:47,966
Right now, the world sees us as a group of sniveling,

654
00:25:48,053 --> 00:25:49,795
spiteful, vindictive individuals,

655
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:54,229
not really what I�d hoped for, nor is that how I portrayed the two of you

656
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,738
in my personal letter of recommendation to Harvard.

657
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,681
I would hate to have to write a second letter to the university

658
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,776
correcting my errors in judgment.

659
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:03,907
However, I�ve done it before.

660
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:05,832
Am I making myself clear?

661
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:06,886
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

662
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:09,074
Delightful. You may see yourselves out.

663
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,090
Well, that was delightful, wasn�t it?

664
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:22,611
I�m not sure which is more embarrassing

665
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:25,955
� having Charleston yell at us or knowing we actually had

666
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:27,962
a "shut up/no, you shut up" fight in front of him.

667
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:34,741
So, what do you think, Paris? Do you feel as completely rotten as I do?

668
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:36,819
No.

669
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:48,274
Let�s go.

670
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:52,723
Hello, sailor, bait your hook for you?

671
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:54,783
- You look ridiculous.
- I look adorable.

672
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:58,069
No one ever told me that if you fish, you get to buy an outfit.

673
00:26:58,135 --> 00:27:00,092
I�ll do just about anything if I can buy an outfit.

674
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,668
I�ll just let that go by because we have a lot to do here.

675
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,265
Okay, wait. I�ll just get my purse before we go.

676
00:27:04,337 --> 00:27:04,992
Go where?

677
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:05,832
To the lake.

678
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:07,128
You�re not ready for the lake.

679
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:08,279
Then what am I ready for?

680
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:11,648
You�re putting me in the kiddie lake?

681
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,933
Gotta crawl before you can walk.

682
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:15,453
Oh, this is not at all embarrassing. There�s not even fish in it.

683
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:17,193
Trout.

684
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:19,774
Hey! Aw, they�re so cute!

685
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,324
Hello, hi boys.

686
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:25,242
And look, they�re all "ooh" like they�re singing in a little trout choir.

687
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:26,573
I wouldn�t get too attached.

688
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,197
- Hi Gomer.
- There you go.

689
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,885
- Oh, don�t be scared Pinky.
- And now there�s Pinky.

690
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:32,723
Pinky Dowdy from fourth grade.

691
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:34,823
See her eyes darting back and forth, all panicked?

692
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:35,928
She got that way from dodge ball.

693
00:27:36,015 --> 00:27:37,711
It�s okay, Pinky, nobody�s gonna hurt you.

694
00:27:37,814 --> 00:27:39,722
Hey Pete, stop crowding Pinky.

695
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:42,139
It�s okay, Pinky, just go over there behind Cheryl.

696
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:44,822
Okay, now that everybody knows each other, take this.

697
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:46,343
- What�s that?
- That�s your rod and reel.

698
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,724
Rod and reel. I don�t know if the guys are gonna like this.

699
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:51,782
We can skip the lesson and just take the trout out for some beers.

700
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:54,117
- It�s up to you, really.
- No, I�m going to learn.

701
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:57,378
Okay. I already went ahead and threaded your line

702
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,035
through the guides here, and put a hook on it.

703
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:01,771
- What kind of bait is that?
- It�s a cork.

704
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:03,767
Remind me not to let you cater any of my parties.

705
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,110
It�s to cover the hook.

706
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:07,609
Okay, now, this little metal thing is the bail.

707
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,496
It�s very important. It keeps your line on the spool here.

708
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,689
Line on the spool, got it.

709
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,702
Okay, take the rod in your right hand,

710
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:17,311
and you press your right index finger on the line, holding it against the pole.

711
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:19,840
With your left hand, slide the bail over.

712
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:23,426
Now don�t let go of your index finger or all the line will spin off your spool.

713
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:27,342
Now, pull the pole back over your shoulder

714
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,749
to the ten o�clock position.

715
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,239
Oh, great, now I gotta go buy a watch.

716
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:33,184
You flip your wrist forward to two o�clock,

717
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,102
at the same time releasing your index finger,

718
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,252
casting your line out into the lake

719
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:41,803
in front of you. Now, you try.

720
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:45,144
Okay. Now, I do something with my right hand,

721
00:28:45,238 --> 00:28:48,879
my right index finger, and with the bail and a spool,

722
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,415
and pull the thingy...

723
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,441
Oh! Now, that would�ve been embarrassing if I weren�t dressed like this.

724
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,889
Oh, you released at eleven, you�re supposed to release at two o�clock.

725
00:28:55,974 --> 00:28:56,718
Try again.

726
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,485
Ah! Hey, I made it in the pool, I made it in the pool!

727
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:05,314
I see that.

728
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:06,860
- Why aren�t you excited?
- I�m very excited.

729
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:07,935
Jump around or something.

730
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:09,436
All right, you know, you�re going in the pool.

731
00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:11,162
- Fine.
- All right, what do you think?

732
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:12,677
Ready to take the cork off and try your luck?

733
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:14,501
I�m ready, but they�re not.

734
00:29:14,741 --> 00:29:15,474
No problem.

735
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,158
Man, you need a lot of stuff for fishing.

736
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,633
Normally, you don�t bring your own lake.

737
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:22,678
Right, right.

738
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,500
So, tell me why you�re doing this.

739
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,632
Because you told me to.

740
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:27,941
I mean, tell me why you�re learning to fish.

741
00:29:28,105 --> 00:29:30,241
Oh. I told you, some of my friends are going.

742
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:31,291
What friends? Sookie?

743
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,805
- What?
- Is Sookie going fishing?

744
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,378
- Well...
- Or Rory...

745
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:37,038
did Rory suddenly get the overwhelming urge to dig for worms

746
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,970
and stand in the middle of a lake at five a.m.?

747
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:40,297
Yes?

748
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:44,362
Okay, fine, I met this guy.

749
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:46,887
And he�s kind of an outdoorsy guy.

750
00:29:46,974 --> 00:29:49,099
- Oh, just your type.
- No, not exactly,

751
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,812
but he�s nice and he was talking about fishing,

752
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:54,525
and I think I said something like, �Oh, hey, that sounds great�,

753
00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:56,445
and so he invited me and here I am.

754
00:29:57,051 --> 00:29:57,829
I got it.

755
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:01,296
Sorry I didn�t tell you.

756
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:02,800
Why didn�t you tell me?

757
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,761
I don�t know. I just felt stupid

758
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:07,183
getting rooked into the thing in the first place, and then...

759
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:11,438
plus, you don�t wanna hear about my personal life.

760
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,758
So this�ll be your first date or...

761
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:18,986
- Second.
- Second date.

762
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:21,100
He took me to this coffee tasting place.

763
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:23,168
Coffee tasting, just your type.

764
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,434
- I think that�s great.
- Thank you.

765
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,201
- Yeah. When are you going?
- Sunday morning.

766
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,527
It�s hard to be a fisher woman without your own pole.

767
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,893
You can borrow one of mine if you want.

768
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:35,621
Really?

769
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:37,650
Yeah, I got an extra little tackle box, too... if you want.

770
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:38,954
- That would be great.
- Yeah.

771
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:42,784
Can you do me one more favor?

772
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:43,875
Sure.

773
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:45,156
Put a cork on your hook.

774
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:46,723
Sure.

775
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,447
Could you please just make some coffee?

776
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:57,634
I�m not doing anything for you ever.

777
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,684
Don�t be mad.

778
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:01,244
You set my alarm for 5:15 a.m.

779
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,723
I know, and I did it for purely practical reasons.

780
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:04,470
Which are?

781
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:06,681
My alarm is just not as reliable as your scream.

782
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:08,288
You will pay.

783
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:10,062
That�s fine, honey. Now, coffee?

784
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,132
I am writing this in my ledger of all the crummy things

785
00:31:13,193 --> 00:31:15,294
you�ve done over the years, and when I leave this house,

786
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:17,306
mark my words � you will pay!

787
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:19,445
Oh great.

788
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,580
It�s 5:30 a.m., and I have no coffee in my system.

789
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:30,763
Coffee and donuts.

790
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:32,806
Ah, I like you. Come on in.

791
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:36,835
Right in here.

792
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:39,769
- This is Rory.
- Hi, I�m Alex.

793
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,610
Nice to meet you. Would�ve been nicer in the daylight, but...

794
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:44,321
Okay, let�s get going. It�s not like the fish

795
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:45,503
are gonna wait for us all day, right?

796
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:47,956
I�ll take that coffee now.

797
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:49,374
Thank you.

798
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:52,181
I got it, I got it.

799
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:55,708
Your mom�s never been fishing before, has she?

800
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,764
Oh, no, she�s a well-seasoned fish killer.

801
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,554
I made lunch reservations at the Shahaela Lodge

802
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,617
and Spa afterward. Think she�ll like that?

803
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:07,050
- She�ll love that.
- Good. Go back to sleep.

804
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,247
Min Jae, you lost weight. Look good, not so fat.

805
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:19,190
Thank you.

806
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:25,462
- What is that?
- The bride�s thirsty.

807
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,512
Regulate the water.

808
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,970
Once the dress is on, that�s it � must remain standing.

809
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:34,597
Hi.

810
00:32:35,063 --> 00:32:37,065
Hi, and hi.

811
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,822
This will not be the mental image

812
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,338
you carry around of me the rest of the week.

813
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:41,187
No, it won�t.

814
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:43,839
Hold on, I just saw the back. Yes, it will.

815
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:45,615
Why aren�t you upstairs?

816
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,547
It�s not right to leave the bride alone on her wedding day.

817
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:49,186
Rory�s up there, Mama,

818
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:51,096
and I�m going up there right now.

819
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:52,954
Dave Rygalski was just wondering where to set up.

820
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,239
David, hello.

821
00:32:54,378 --> 00:32:56,073
Hello, Mrs. Kim. The place looks wonderful.

822
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:59,002
Thank you. Come, sit here.

823
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:00,864
This is Ho Kyung, she�ll sing with you.

824
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,851
Watch the high notes, she�s a runner.

825
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,262
How�s it going?

826
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:21,570
I like it, but I�m not the one getting married.

827
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:24,735
Your hair, do you like it?

828
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:29,733
Too much for me.

829
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:32,570
Oh, I found the Mrs. Kim-approved makeup in the drawer,

830
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:33,599
but let me tell you,

831
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:35,831
since the last wedding, it has developed a smell.

832
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:37,066
A what? Oh boy.

833
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:38,141
As I said, a smell.

834
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:40,333
Well, I�ve got the good stuff right here,

835
00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:44,797
right next to the Peggy Lee.

836
00:33:44,874 --> 00:33:46,133
- Seems appropriate.
- I thought so.

837
00:33:46,877 --> 00:33:48,387
- Shall we?
- The foot stool.

838
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:52,743
All set. So, Dave�s here.

839
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,880
He is, huh?

840
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:56,825
I still can�t believe he�s willing to do all this just to go out with me.

841
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:59,928
Well, hey, where else can he find a decent, pretty, smart girl

842
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:02,765
who can recite the entire encyclopedia of rock in 5/8 time?

843
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:03,718
Nowhere, I guess.

844
00:34:03,865 --> 00:34:05,315
I�m really happy for you guys.

845
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,650
Thanks. I�m really happy for you and Jess, too.

846
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:10,476
Thanks. You know it�s okay, right?

847
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:12,970
- Not following.
- It�s okay not to like Jess.

848
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,334
- I said I was happy for you.
- I know.

849
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:17,281
God, I�m such a jerk.

850
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:20,747
You�re not. Look, we�re not always going to like the same things.

851
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:23,609
Like, you like Smashing Pumpkins and I don�t.

852
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:25,453
But that�s only �cause you�re close-minded and blind.

853
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:27,070
What can I say? They�re not my angst.

854
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,503
Besides, it�s not like I don�t want to like Jess.

855
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:32,360
I can�t help it. As your best friend, I�m very protective of you.

856
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:34,279
You could try giving him a second chance.

857
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:35,156
I could.

858
00:34:36,431 --> 00:34:37,746
I should. I will.

859
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:41,597
Hey, maybe we can all go out sometime together as a group,

860
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,558
you know, you, me, Dave, Jess.

861
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:45,110
Absolutely, we should do that sometime.

862
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:45,831
Great.

863
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:46,922
Incoming!

864
00:34:49,794 --> 00:34:50,957
What�s going on in here?

865
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,139
- Nothing, Mama.
- I fell off my chair.

866
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:54,275
Oh, well, don�t.

867
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,299
Yes, ma�am.

868
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:56,907
She looks very beautiful.

869
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:58,485
Must�ve gotten a good night sleep.

870
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,767
How many people do you think have gotten married here over the years?

871
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:10,199
I counted once off the guest book � forty-six.

872
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:13,768
Wow. What happened to that one, Min Cha?

873
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,135
She married a real mean guy.

874
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:17,296
Wan Nam. Didn�t I tell you about them?

875
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:17,909
No.

876
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:20,670
Min Cha put up with seven years of Wan Nam

877
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,907
telling her she was stupid and ordering her to cook all his meals.

878
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:28,305
Then one day, he was in the kitchen looking for his lunch and she just snapped.

879
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:30,158
Took a carrot peeler and turned on him.

880
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,136
A carrot peeler?

881
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,734
You can get those things pretty sharp.

882
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:34,982
Anyway, she just came at him and started peeling.

883
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,324
The neighbors called the police.

884
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,736
They showed up and Wan Nam was just standing there all peeled.

885
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:39,430
What happened?

886
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,421
He didn�t press charges, but now he makes all his own meals,

887
00:35:42,502 --> 00:35:44,009
sleeps in a locked separate room,

888
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,964
and keeps the cutting board by his bed for protection.

889
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:46,947
Still married, though.

890
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,748
Everybody�s still married. It�s like a factory system here.

891
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:51,899
They all come to the weddings, find a spouse,

892
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,465
get married and stay that way �til they die.

893
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:55,242
They mate for life, like the loons.

894
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,909
You know, this may be the last wedding for a long time, though.

895
00:35:58,018 --> 00:35:58,699
How come?

896
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:00,941
All my cousins in their twenties and thirties are married.

897
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:02,156
James was the last one.

898
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:04,617
Wow. It feels like we�ve had at least

899
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,324
two of these every year since I can remember.

900
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:07,798
Elementary school, when we met.

901
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,066
Elementary school, when we met, yeah.

902
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:12,063
Well, we do have some distant relatives left.

903
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:13,533
Maybe we can go to one of those weddings.

904
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,246
You know, when we come home from college on break or something.

905
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:18,264
We should definitely keep the makeup.

906
00:36:18,403 --> 00:36:19,283
We definitely should.

907
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:21,740
And who knows, maybe the next Kim wedding we do makeup for will be yours.

908
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,880
Too scary, don�t freak me out.

909
00:36:24,035 --> 00:36:24,658
Sorry.

910
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,271
So, what do you think, eye shadow?

911
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:28,288
Why not? Let�s do it.

912
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:30,901
Peeled to death,

913
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,708
that�s a bad way to go.

914
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:51,959
Here you go. We�ll top that off for ya.

915
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:57,849
Coffee over here.

916
00:36:58,905 --> 00:36:59,624
Where you going?

917
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:05,652
Miss Leahy?

918
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:08,156
Yeah? Mr. Danes, how are you?

919
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:09,861
Good, good, and it�s Luke.

920
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,257
Okay, Luke. What can I do for you?

921
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,920
I wouldn�t cross there.

922
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:15,185
Why not?

923
00:37:15,325 --> 00:37:18,749
Taylor�s a stickler about jaywalking and he�s town magistrate.

924
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:20,614
I�d hate for you to be disbarred.

925
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:24,162
That would be a bad way to end a career, thank you.

926
00:37:24,305 --> 00:37:25,538
Sure. So...

927
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,427
did the lease forms all work out? I mean, was my signature okay?

928
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:36,415
�Cause sometimes I�m in a kind of a hurry and my hand just takes off without me.

929
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:38,612
Your signature seemed very steady.

930
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,316
Good, good, �cause you never know.

931
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:43,702
- Well...
- Listen...

932
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,105
I was thinking about that cup of coffee you had at my place the other day.

933
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:53,737
I felt bad making Taylor pay for it � not that I ever feel bad sticking it to Taylor.

934
00:37:54,173 --> 00:37:57,172
I just thought it might get you in trouble with a client.

935
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,871
I�d hate to see you disbarred again.

936
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,098
To be honest, I actually paid for the coffee myself.

937
00:38:02,202 --> 00:38:06,021
Oh, then at least let me pay you back for it.

938
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,527
You wanna give me seventy-five cents?

939
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:10,441
No, no, what I meant was...

940
00:38:12,442 --> 00:38:13,784
Ah, what the hell?

941
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:17,434
Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?

942
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:20,210
- Yeah.
- Really?

943
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:21,863
I�d love to have dinner with you.

944
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:23,277
Great. Okay...

945
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:25,411
well, I have your card.

946
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:27,260
Why don�t I give you a call this week

947
00:38:27,486 --> 00:38:29,298
and we�ll make that happen.

948
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:31,531
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, sounds good.

949
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,675
So, see ya. Watch those crosswalks.

950
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,104
Thanks, I will.

951
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:43,128
- Shut up.
- I said nothing.

952
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:44,240
Well, don�t.

953
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,299
And do you vow to uphold the principles

954
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:03,308
of the seventh commandment as set out in Exodus 20:14?

955
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:04,076
I do.

956
00:39:14,634 --> 00:39:17,634
And so, in the Glory of God,

957
00:39:17,783 --> 00:39:21,755
I pronounce you husband and wife.

958
00:39:37,522 --> 00:39:38,331
That was nice.

959
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,322
Yeah, it was really nice

960
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:42,898
Reception at Elks Lodge. Two hundred guests.

961
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:44,459
Food goes fast. Let�s move.

962
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:47,783
I can�t believe that�s the last time I�ll hear your mom say that.

963
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:50,117
So, are you coming to the reception?

964
00:39:50,353 --> 00:39:52,754
Oh, no, I was actually going to...

965
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:55,053
- Go meet Jess.
- Yeah. Are you mad?

966
00:39:55,273 --> 00:39:58,636
No. You know, he can come to the reception with you if...

967
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,423
He�s not really the reception kind of guy, is he?

968
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:03,031
Not really. Not yet, anyway.

969
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,556
- We�ll work on that.
- Yes, we will.

970
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,410
Okay, tell him hi for me.

971
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:08,479
I will. Tell Dave hi for me.

972
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:09,964
- I will. 
- Bye.

973
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:10,871
Bye.

974
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:18,495
- Lane!
- Yes, Mama.

975
00:40:19,113 --> 00:40:20,117
This is Young Chui.

976
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:23,241
He will take you to the prom.

977
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:24,480
What?

978
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,300
Young Chui works for his father who builds Adventist hospitals.

979
00:40:27,496 --> 00:40:30,512
Young Chui will go to college at Loma Linda University.

980
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:34,157
Then he will return to work for his father building Adventist hospitals.

981
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:38,228
Now, put your coat on. Young Chui and his parents will drive you to Elks Lodge.

982
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:40,901
Mama!

983
00:40:42,514 --> 00:40:43,651
I�m sure you�re very nice.

984
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:48,617
Not a bus stop, door�s that way.

985
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:51,455
- I have to talk to you.
- Get your coat, we have to go.

986
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:52,167
No.

987
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:53,558
No?

988
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,233
I can�t go to the prom with Young Chui.

989
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,900
Why not? I thought you wanted to go to the prom.

990
00:40:58,054 --> 00:40:59,267
Yes, I do wanna go to the prom.

991
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:02,043
I thought you say I could approve the boy you go to the prom with.

992
00:41:02,483 --> 00:41:03,813
I did say that, but...

993
00:41:03,942 --> 00:41:05,197
I found the boy, I approve the boy,

994
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:06,498
now you go to the prom with the boy.

995
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,854
Mama, I�m sure Young Chui�s very nice

996
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:13,425
and I�m so grateful you�re letting me go to the prom, but the thing is...

997
00:41:13,646 --> 00:41:14,684
I like someone else.

998
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:17,056
- Someone else?
- Yes.

999
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:18,140
Someone else who?

1000
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:20,768
Someone else who�s been a good friend to this family.

1001
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:23,702
Who�s proven himself to be of high moral character,

1002
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,580
someone who you yourself feels is worthy.

1003
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:28,249
So worthy, in fact, you let him sit in our pew at church.

1004
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:30,502
Who � who did I let sit in our pew?

1005
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:31,775
Dave Rygalski.

1006
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:33,214
The guitar player?

1007
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:34,557
I know, crazy, right?

1008
00:41:34,746 --> 00:41:37,864
I can hardly believe it myself because, to be quite honest with you,

1009
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:41,274
when I first met him, when you hired him to play at Thanksgiving,

1010
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:43,840
I just didn�t like him at all. He bugged me, actually.

1011
00:41:43,947 --> 00:41:46,539
But the more you liked him and trusted him,

1012
00:41:46,656 --> 00:41:50,578
the more I saw the good in him, the God in him, actually,

1013
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,493
and now I�m convinced...

1014
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:55,017
he�s the boy I want to take me to prom.

1015
00:41:56,282 --> 00:41:57,368
He�s not Korean.

1016
00:42:04,137 --> 00:42:07,915
Lane? Hey, Lane? Is everything all right?

1017
00:42:08,945 --> 00:42:10,168
You�re not Korean.

1018
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,010
I�m home!

1019
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:27,614
Upstairs, bathroom!

1020
00:42:35,924 --> 00:42:36,604
Hey.

1021
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:39,457
- Oh, no.
- Isn�t she cute?

1022
00:42:39,564 --> 00:42:40,297
What happened?

1023
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,579
The cork fell off my hook and Jayne Mansfield over here bit.

1024
00:42:42,662 --> 00:42:43,481
Jayne Mansfield.

1025
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:46,169
Not the brightest fish in the pond, but she�s awfully pretty.

1026
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:47,669
- You caught a fish.
- Yes.

1027
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:48,975
- And you brought it home.
- Yes.

1028
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:49,994
How are you gonna take a bath?

1029
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,049
I don�t know.

1030
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,128
- How long is it gonna live?
- Hard to say.

1031
00:42:53,245 --> 00:42:54,147
What are you gonna feed it?

1032
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:55,676
See, this is why I don�t fish.

1033
00:42:55,846 --> 00:42:56,967
She is kinda cute.

1034
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:58,494
And she has a great tail swish.

1035
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:00,890
So, other than bringing home a pet, how was fishing?

1036
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:04,531
Good. The lake was beautiful, snowy and sparkly,

1037
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,870
and right down the road from the Shahaela Lodge and Spa.

1038
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:07,741
I knew that.

1039
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:08,899
How could you already know that?

1040
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:10,168
Alex told me when you guys left.

1041
00:43:10,312 --> 00:43:12,610
Two dates with this guy and you�re already in cahoots with each other.

1042
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:14,321
Ah, what can I say? I�m wily.

1043
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:16,538
So, are you going out with him again?

1044
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,706
Camping?

1045
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:21,003
Good. So do you think maybe we should try to rehabilitate her

1046
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,319
and send her back into the wild?

1047
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:24,780
Unfortunately, I think she�s already domesticated.

1048
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,070
- Baths and scented candles.
- We�ll just have to keep her.

1049
00:43:27,198 --> 00:43:28,596
Maybe we can train her to do tricks.

1050
00:43:28,704 --> 00:43:30,178
Tomorrow. Night Jayne.

1051
00:43:30,297 --> 00:43:31,131
Night Jayne.
