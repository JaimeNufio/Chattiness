1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,087
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,591
- You have a formal coming up?
- Yeah, but I don't think I'm gonna go.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,092
Nonsense. Of course you're going.

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,763
I just don't want you to miss on
any experience because you're too afraid.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,307
I'm afraid? Of what?

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,059
Of asking Dean.

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,144
Are you asking me
to go to a dance with you?

8
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,270
No.

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,522
Yes.

10
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,816
- Bye, Grandma. Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,906
- What do you know about this boy?
- I know that Rory likes him...

12
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,493
and that his parole officer has high hopes
for his rehabilitation.

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,620
- Hey.
- What?

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,999
- Thank you for tonight. It was perfect.
- You're welcome.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,797
- Lorelai, get up. Right now!
- What?

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,131
Rory's not home.

17
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,175
Have you been here all night?

18
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,259
Oh, no.

19
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,428
- Please let me come with you.
- No!

20
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,013
I have to go home.

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,349
Let's be calm
until we know what happened.

22
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,684
They were out all night!

23
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,061
- She'll get pregnant.
- No, she's not.

24
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,439
She's smart and careful, and I trust her.
She's gonna be fine.

25
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,943
If you can't accept or believe that,
then I don't want you in this house!

26
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,655
Do you have any idea what it's like
to wake up with my mother here...

27
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,699
and find out that you never came home?

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,575
So all this is about Grandma being here?

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,703
No, it's about
the feeling of complete terror...

30
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,705
when you're not in bed in the morning!

31
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,831
Nothing happened!

32
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,708
It's a different terror when I find out...

33
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,626
that you spent the night with some guy!

34
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,337
I'm sorry that I screwed up,
and that you got yelled at...

35
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,090
but I didn't do anything. And you know it!

36
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,226
People, please pay attention!

37
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:45,564
Now, I want my before Mary over here
and my after Mary over here.

38
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,066
Wise men, shepherd,
line up for the processional.

39
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,193
I only have half a donkey?

40
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,904
I need the rest of the donkey.

41
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,408
- Hold still, Kirk.
- You stuck me.

42
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,993
- Did not.
- Did, too.

43
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,828
Okay, be quiet now.

44
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,254
Taylor, the Baby Jesus
is missing an arm again.

45
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,380
What?

46
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,175
- I was getting it out of the trunk and...
- Let me see that.

47
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,345
For Pete's sake. Okay, listen up!
The arm is missing!

48
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,639
I repeat, the arm is missing!

49
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,351
Maybe it's time to get a new Baby Jesus.
One that's a boy.

50
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,772
- It's a doll. No one can tell.
- It has a bow.

51
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:31,526
This has been the Baby Jesus
in every Christmas Pageant since 1965.

52
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,070
- Were you here in 1965?
- No, I wasn't.

53
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,614
Find the arm.

54
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,080
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

55
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,292
- You're flinching.
- You stuck me once and might do it again.

56
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,211
You know what? You're done.

57
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,132
- I swear, I've looked twice.
- Look again.

58
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,842
Taylor, come quickly.

59
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,553
Our before Mary's
about to become an after.

60
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,931
Who else in town is knocked up?

61
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,488
- Find the arm?
- Nope.

62
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,748
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

63
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,895
- Hey, I thought we were meeting at Luke's.
- We were?

64
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,982
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I forgot.

65
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,027
Let me guess.
You and Lorelai haven't made up yet?

66
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,194
Nope.

67
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,031
Things are still very Miracle Worker
at my house.

68
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,533
God, how did everything
get so screwed up?

69
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,286
You staying out all night with Dean
had a part in it.

70
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,913
And my grandmother being there
to witness it didn't help.

71
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,874
- Never does.
- It sucks.

72
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,252
Things were good.
School was good, Dean was good.

73
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,255
Now my mother and I are barely speaking.

74
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,507
Mom and Grandma are barely speaking.

75
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,552
- Dean's new name is Narcolepsy Boy.
- How's he taking it?

76
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,596
I haven't talked to him since it happened.

77
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,890
- That's four days ago.
- I know.

78
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,476
- Has he called?
- I told him not to.

79
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,770
- And he listened?
- No.

80
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,438
Good boy.

81
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,900
I really need to talk about
something else now.

82
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,277
- You went shopping.
- Yes, I did.

83
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,155
I got a mooing cow-shaped timer
for Sookie...

84
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,908
some Cardio Salsa tapes for Michel,
a book for Dean.

85
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,243
- You got Dean a book?
- Yeah, Metamorphosis.

86
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,579
It's Kafka.

87
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,290
- Very romantic.
- I think it is romantic.

88
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,959
I know I've always dreamed
that some guy would get me...

89
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,128
a really confusing Czechoslovakian novel.

90
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,713
I think he'll appreciate it.

91
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,716
- A book sends the wrong message.
- What are you talking about?

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,844
Look at what a gift says
to the other person, not to you.

93
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,388
Remember two years ago,
I got my mom that perfume?

94
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,098
- Yeah.
- Okay.

95
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,811
To me that said, 'Mom, you work hard.
You deserve something fancy. '

96
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,606
To my mother, it said,
'Mom, here's some smelly sex juice...

97
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,233
'the kind I use to lure boys with. '

98
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,818
And resulted in me being sent to
Bible camp all summer.

99
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,821
- Yeah, but...
- Imagine that you actually gave Dean...

100
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,200
something really romantic,
and he gave you a football.

101
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:11,162
Your hypothetical romantic present
is saying that you really like him...

102
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,873
and his present is saying,
'Let's just be friends. '

103
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,169
- You're saying that this book...
- Is a Czechoslovakian football, yes.

104
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,005
Then what do I get him?

105
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,884
You should find out what he's giving you,
and then gauge your gift accordingly.

106
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,011
But doesn't that take the fun out of it?

107
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,888
Gift-giving is serious business.

108
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:33,101
If you don't believe me, try spending
a month at Korean Bible Camp.

109
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,688
Yes, right there.

110
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,232
Now flip the elf and the fairy.

111
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,235
- Which one's the fairy?
- The one with the wand.

112
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,070
What are you doing?

113
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,489
- Isn't this a wand?
- No, that is a staff.

114
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,367
- This isn't a fairy?
- That is Little Bo Peep.

115
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,870
- You don't wanna move her?
- I would prefer that you didn't.

116
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,958
- So, we're still looking for a fairy.
- The search continues.

117
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,462
- No chance you're gonna help me?
- None whatsoever.

118
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,301
Independence Inn. Lorelai speaking.

119
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,720
Mom, hello.

120
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,306
I wanted to talk about
the Christmas dinner this Friday.

121
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,224
- Christmas dinner.
- You forgot.

122
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,435
There's been a lot going on around here.

123
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,604
Your shindig's not high
on my list of things to obsess about.

124
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,692
I'm sorry if the timing's bad, but the world
does not always revolve around you.

125
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,943
Thanks for the tip.

126
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,237
Cocktails are at 6:00. Dinner is at 8:00.

127
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,698
- I probably won't be there for cocktails.
- Why not?

128
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,784
- Because I have to work.
- You can't leave work early?

129
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,244
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

130
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,912
It's not in my job description.

131
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,497
Then don't come.

132
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,416
- What?
- Don't come.

133
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,377
This is obviously
an enormous burden for you.

134
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,713
- Yeah, but...
- Just send Rory.

135
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,134
You're telling me not to come to
the Christmas party?

136
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,677
You're obviously too busy.

137
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,472
I had the German measles in fifth grade.

138
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,807
I still had to show up
to the Christmas party.

139
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,559
Let's be honest here.

140
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,271
I'm not too happy with you right now,
and I assume you're not happy with me.

141
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:04,776
My polka-dot dress matched my face,
and still I had to sit through 12 courses.

142
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,071
I am tired of forcing you
to do all those terrible things...

143
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,614
that infringe upon your life.

144
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,992
And I do not have the energy to pretend
that the way you treated me...

145
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,494
was in any way acceptable.

146
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,662
So you're uninviting me
to Christmas dinner?

147
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,039
Yes, I am.

148
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,540
- Fine.
- Fine.

149
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,043
- Anything else?
- I believe that's all.

150
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,253
Great, Mom.
It's been swell talking to you.

151
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,214
- Goodbye, Lorelai.
- Bye.

152
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,302
- This one?
- No.

153
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,144
I wish you'd change your mind.

154
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,355
It's not my mind
that needs to be changed.

155
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,774
- I don't think she meant it.
- She meant it.

156
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,818
Maybe she thinks she meant it
at the time...

157
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,529
but I bet she won't mean it
when I show up without you.

158
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,366
Without a map to follow that reasoning,
I say, 'Take a hat, it's cold outside. '

159
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:57,370
- You just wanna hold a grudge.
- Yes, it burns more calories.

160
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,871
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

161
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,707
How do you think your grandma
got those legs of hers?

162
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,210
She's not exactly a StairMaster gal.

163
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,171
Never saw her on the running track.

164
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,092
I don't remember the Country Club
organizing a Tae-Bo class.

165
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,593
Fine, forget it.

166
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,137
Should I put your name
on Grandma's present?

167
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,891
Yes. Sign it 'The innkeeper
formerly known as her daughter. '

168
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,143
- You know what I think?
- What?

169
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,771
I think you're acting a little immature.

170
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,897
I'm not acting.

171
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,526
What about the apple tarts?
You wait all year for those apple tarts.

172
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,529
I can live without the apple tarts.

173
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,864
You've made up songs
after eating five of them...

174
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,617
with lyrics that contradict
that last statement.

175
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,412
- You have to go. You're late.
- You really won't come?

176
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,790
Is somebody speaking? It couldn't be Rory.
She's halfway to Hartford.

177
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,458
Fine, I'm going.

178
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,212
Drive carefully. Watch out for ice.

179
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,216
Bring me back one of those tarts.

180
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,276
- Hi, Grandma.
- Rory, come in. You look lovely.

181
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,111
This is from me and Mom.

182
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,656
Aren't you thoughtful?
I'll just put it under the tree.

183
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,783
Mom actually picked it out.

184
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,661
- Do you know Holland Prescott?
- I met her last year.

185
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,247
- Holland, look who's here.
- Hello, Rory.

186
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,001
- That's not my proposal.
- Yes, I know. Henry toned it down a little.

187
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:31,422
- Henry did? He is a toddler.
- He thought your take was conservative.

188
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,717
- And a moron!
- Be very careful.

189
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,969
This man may be our boss one day.

190
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,555
- That will never happen.
- All right.

191
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:40,765
Have you heard something?

192
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,600
Richard, Alan, look who's here.

193
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,143
- Hello.
- Hi.

194
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,187
- Where's your mother?
- She...

195
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,316
- Over by the apple tarts, I assume.
- Lorelai couldn't come tonight.

196
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,902
- She couldn't?
- No, she had to work.

197
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,988
Speaking of which,
I'm gonna give that man a call.

198
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,032
You're getting yourself all worked up.

199
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,368
As long as I've been with this company,
it's been run by gentlemen.

200
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,954
Revising a man's work
without so much as a phone call...

201
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,832
- would have been unheard of.
- It's a new world out there.

202
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,877
Please stop all this shoptalk.
We're here to celebrate.

203
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,547
- I'm gonna call that man.
- It's past midnight in London.

204
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,216
Even better.

205
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,469
Grandma, could I talk to you
alone, please?

206
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,012
You need something to drink.

207
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,139
I wanna apologize about the other night.

208
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,851
- Please, this is a party.
- I messed up. It's my fault.

209
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,895
This isn't the time or place
to discuss this.

210
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,856
- Your mother should've taught you that.
- Don't be mad at her.

211
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,441
I'm not mad at anyone.

212
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,276
Go back in and join the party.

213
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,363
And take this to Gigi on your way back.

214
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,661
Yes, Joe, I know it's Friday night,
but I ordered my pizza an hour ago.

215
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,539
No, I did not hear about the delivery van.

216
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,837
I am very sorry to hear that.
Was it a fairly new van?

217
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:57,967
Great. As with most tragedies in life...

218
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,719
there comes a time
when you need to pick up and move on.

219
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,806
So what's the next phase
of the delivery saga?

220
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,939
How long until your brother's back
with the Razor scooter?

221
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,695
Just call me when he gets there.

222
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,238
Bye, Joe.

223
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,097
- Hi there. How you doing?
- Fine.

224
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,850
Good. Shouldn't you have
a squeegee with you?

225
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,436
- I was...
- Looking for Rory? She's not here.

226
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,687
Okay.

227
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,231
- I'll tell her you tapped.
- Thanks.

228
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,736
Something else?

229
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,031
I wanted to say
that things got all messed up.

230
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,158
- Yes, they did.
- And I'm sorry.

231
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,703
- But nothing happened.
- Okay, I have to go.

232
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,247
We sat down,
and we were reading this book...

233
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,916
and then we fell asleep.

234
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,835
Pick a more interesting book next time.

235
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:03,050
So am I public enemy number one
with you?

236
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,135
Number one? I don't know.

237
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,137
Would you settle for top five?

238
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,974
I'm still hot for that crazy bomber guy
who's been living in a cave for a year.

239
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,519
Please, just tell me where I stand.

240
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,355
I don't know where you stand, okay?

241
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,191
All I know is my 16-year-old
didn't come home one night.

242
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:20,734
You had something to do with that.

243
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,320
- I told you, nothing happened.
- I heard.

244
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,823
You can hate me,
but you have to believe me.

245
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,741
I wouldn't let anything happen to her.

246
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,785
- You happened to her.
- I won't hurt her.

247
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:33,163
- You know, I was 16 when I had Rory.
- I know.

248
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,374
That is the same age she is now.

249
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:36,834
She wants to go to Harvard.

250
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,504
She will, and if she doesn't,
it won't be because of me.

251
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,634
I don't hate you.

252
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,262
- No?
- No.

253
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,224
Though I did imagine 20 ways
to remove your head from your body.

254
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:56,353
Which one looked the best?

255
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,730
Hedge clippers. Dull ones.

256
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,316
Sure, you wouldn't want it to go quick.

257
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,609
Exactly.

258
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,615
Okay, I'm gonna go.

259
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,247
We have a really nice front door.

260
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:18,125
You might wanna use it sometimes.

261
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,543
Got it.

262
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,420
See you.

263
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,909
- Henry, you ring on three.
- I thought it was two.

264
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:55,412
- Chuck rings on two. You ring on three.
- I'm on one.

265
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,041
- Are you sure?
- Nope. Sorry, you're right. I'm two.

266
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,627
From the top. One, two.

267
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,849
- Rory coming?
- No.

268
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,434
- She on a date?
- No.

269
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:19,353
Good. So you forbid her
to see the bag boy.

270
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,937
I'd rather not talk about it.

271
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,733
- Just tell me you forbid her to see him.
- I did not.

272
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,151
Are you crazy?

273
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,821
He's moving up to produce,
so he's become quite a catch.

274
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,865
- That kid is trouble.
- Can I order?

275
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:33,700
First time I saw him, I thought that.

276
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,119
I'm the one who told you
I thought he was trouble.

277
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,454
You told me I was crazy.

278
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:39,414
You are crazy, and he is trouble.

279
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,376
He is not trouble.
He's 6'2', he's beautiful...

280
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,169
and he's in love with my daughter.

281
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,545
- Trouble.
- Big time.

282
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,506
I'll get you a burger.

283
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,924
Wait.

284
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:50,634
Can I see a menu?

285
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,469
- You need to see a menu?
- Yes.

286
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,347
- You come here every day.
- But I usually order the same thing.

287
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,516
Tonight I'm in the mood for
something different.

288
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:00,060
- A menu.
- Piece of paper, list of food offered.

289
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,187
Here.

290
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,027
It's not in Japanese.

291
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,656
Don't you have any kind of holiday special,
something festive?

292
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:15,534
I just got some Grey Poupon. It's French.

293
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,496
Tonight's my parents'
big Christmas celebration.

294
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:23,792
There's good food,
these amazing apple tarts, big tree.

295
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:28,130
It's the only holiday I actually enjoy
going over there for, and this year...

296
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,256
I'm uninvited.

297
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,175
Why would anybody
celebrate Christmas two weeks early?

298
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,052
Did you hear that I was uninvited?

299
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,138
To your parents' fake Christmas party?
I did.

300
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,889
- Do you care?
- Obviously you do.

301
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes, I do. And I don't know why.

302
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,727
You liked going,
Rory's there without you...

303
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,896
you and Rory aren't getting along
right now...

304
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,442
and you feel bad at being separated
at a time you usually share together.

305
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,863
Did I mention you come here
every damn day?

306
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,657
- I'll have a burger.
- Coming right up.

307
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,039
Emily, you've outdone yourself yet again.

308
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,835
Yes, I can't imagine the hours you spent
slaving over a hot stove.

309
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,254
- You're teasing me, Alan.
- It's delicious.

310
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:12,424
A compliment for my chef
is a compliment for me. Thank you.

311
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:15,760
I, for one, would like to know
where Henry is at this hour.

312
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,347
Probably gallivanting around London
like a bull out to stud.

313
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,891
Richard, please.

314
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:24,102
How's he supposed to negotiate
the contract tomorrow...

315
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,646
if he's been out at all hours
with some cheap tramp?

316
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,356
Knowing Henry, she wasn't cheap.

317
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,277
This is wildly inappropriate dinner
conversation in front of a young lady.

318
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,448
- Is it unbearably hot in here?
- Don't loosen your tie at the table.

319
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,326
What are your plans
for the Christmas holidays, Rory?

320
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,036
I'll just be hanging out with my mom.

321
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,706
It's a shame she couldn't come.
She's always such a kick.

322
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:48,543
Lorelai wasn't feeling well,
so I suggested she stay home.

323
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,796
It is hot in here.
I'm gonna lower the thermostat.

324
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,008
- Poor thing. What's wrong with her?
- She has a touch of the flu.

325
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:58,845
- Forget the thermostat.
- I thought you said she was working.

326
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,641
She was supposed to work,
but then she caught the flu.

327
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,143
Tell her we missed her.

328
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,269
I will.

329
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,981
For heaven's sake.

330
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,908
- What did you do?
- You wanted something festive.

331
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:23,036
- You made me a Santa burger.
- It's no big deal.

332
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,121
He has a hat and everything.

333
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,165
Yeah, I just cut a piece of Wonder Bread...

334
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:29,626
poured on some ketchup,
piped on some cream cheese.

335
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:33,380
No one ever made me something
quite this disgusting before.

336
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,131
- I thank you.
- You're welcome.

337
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,509
- What?
- Outside.

338
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:40,762
- It's like the North Pole out there.
- This sign isn't a decoration.

339
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:44,015
- Nothing in here is a decoration.
- It disturbs the other customers.

340
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,434
Really? Maybe we should take a vote.

341
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,604
Who thinks we shouldn't use
cell phones in here?

342
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:53,733
Screw democracy.

343
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,445
Perfect. Now I have to check my voicemail.

344
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,323
What's going on?

345
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,742
We were caroling around town
and we got chilly.

346
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,704
We thought we could trade you a song
for some hot chocolate.

347
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,040
- You want free hot chocolate?
- We'll sing for it, any tune you like.

348
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,543
- And then I give you free hot chocolate?
- Yeah.

349
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,628
You can have your hot chocolate,
pay for it...

350
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,672
then go next door
and sing for marshmallows.

351
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:17,757
- Oh, my God.
- These are your neighbors...

352
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,551
Shut up, Taylor. What's going on?

353
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:22,387
- My father's in the hospital.
- What?

354
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,556
He collapsed or something. I don't know.

355
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,434
I need to call a cab. Where's the phone?

356
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,145
Can anybody give me...
I'm holding a phone.

357
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,939
- Calm down.
- I can't. I need a cab.

358
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,524
What's the number? God.

359
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:39,112
It's something cabs, or cabs something.
1-800-CABS?

360
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,573
Can somebody tell me
the damn number of the cab guy?

361
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:42,615
I'll drive you.

362
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,493
But there's food, and people,
and a burger with a face.

363
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,747
Everybody out, we're closed.
Let's go! Food's on me.

364
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,250
Put on your coat and get your stuff.

365
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,086
Taylor, have your hot chocolate,
then lock up.

366
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,380
Come on, my truck's out back.

367
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,385
- Luke, I'm...
- I know. Let's go.

368
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:15,773
- Look.
- Relax.

369
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,152
- We're being passed by senior citizens.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

370
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,486
Bye, Grandma.

371
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,738
There's ice on the road.

372
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:25,575
- Those people aren't being safe.
- At least they're getting somewhere.

373
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:29,287
You've checked it five times.
I've listened to it twice. It's not changing.

374
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,290
'Grandpa's in the hospital. Please come. '
No details, no info.

375
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,418
- Who taught her to leave messages?
- I'm sure she was in a hurry.

376
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:38,171
I need details.
Why is he in the hospital? How bad is it?

377
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:41,841
What are the circumstances
involving him being in the hospital?

378
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,385
We'll be there very soon,
and you'll know everything.

379
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,304
- What if he's dead?
- He's not dead.

380
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,639
- How do you know?
- I know.

381
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,141
You're psychic now?
You're suddenly getting visions...

382
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,978
while you drive at 20 miles an hour
in the oldest truck known to man?

383
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,106
I'm sorry. You're killing yourself
to get me there...

384
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,400
- and I'm yelling at you. I don't mean it.
- I know.

385
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,569
I feel like this is one of those moments...

386
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,823
where I should be remembering
all the great times I had with my dad.

387
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:09,160
The time he took me shopping
for a Barbie...

388
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,454
or to the circus, or fishing.

389
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:15,333
- My mind is a complete blank.
- I'm sure it happened.

390
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,460
No, it didn't. We never did any of that.

391
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:20,088
He went to work, came home,
read the paper, went to bed.

392
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:22,465
I snuck out the window. Simple.

393
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:24,717
He was a very by-the-numbers guy.

394
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,804
I was never very good with numbers.

395
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,056
I'm sure he loves you.

396
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,268
My dad is not a bad guy.

397
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,895
I'm sure he's not.

398
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,564
He lived his life the way
he thought he was supposed to.

399
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,568
He followed the rules taught to him
by his non-fishing, non-Barbie-buying dad.

400
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,153
He worked hard.

401
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,407
He bought a nice house.
He provided for my mom.

402
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,492
All he asked in return...

403
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:52,662
was for his daughter
to wear white dresses and go to cotillion...

404
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:55,206
and want the same life that he had.

405
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,001
What a disappointment it must have been
for him to get me.

406
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:02,004
I can't imagine anyone seeing you
as a disappointment.

407
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:05,591
I bet you'd buy a Barbie for your daughter.

408
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:09,387
I'd probably give her the cash
to buy it herself...

409
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,639
and then meet her by the baseball cards.

410
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,809
- You'll make a great dad.
- You make a great mom.

411
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:24,068
It's just the daughter part
I don't have down yet.

412
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:29,407
Okay, hold on.

413
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,201
That Camaro is dust.

414
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:43,588
- But why can't I see him?
- They're running some tests.

415
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:46,382
- I'd like to meet the doctor.
- You will.

416
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,259
Some strange man
is working on my husband.

417
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,386
- I have a right to meet this person.
- You will.

418
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,763
- I wanna see the room you'll put him in.
- You will.

419
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:55,725
Stop saying, 'You will. '
Put a proper sentence together.

420
00:23:55,808 --> 00:23:58,186
Ma'am, please wait here.

421
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:06,777
- Did you find out anything?
- Please. They run this place like the CIA.

422
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:10,907
Joshua, thank God.
This place is infuriating.

423
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,535
It's all right. I'm gonna check on him now.
Have you filled out the forms?

424
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,787
I don't care about forms,
I wanna see my husband.

425
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,623
- Is she being obstinate?
- Very.

426
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:22,084
Let me see what's going on,
and we'll take it from there.

427
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,296
And there he goes, through the doors.

428
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:28,674
- Maybe I should call Mom again.
- Never mind, I'm sure she's very busy.

429
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,802
- That's not true...
- Go get your grandfather a paper.

430
00:24:32,178 --> 00:24:33,971
The Wall Street Journal or Barron's.

431
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,474
He'll want something to read
when he gets to his room.

432
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:39,018
Okay, can I get you anything?
Maybe a coffee?

433
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:40,811
No, dear, I'm fine.

434
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:02,333
We're not here. Speak if you must.

435
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:18,683
- Ms. Gilmore, I need you to...
- It's not Ms. Gilmore, it's Mrs. Gilmore.

436
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:21,143
I am not a Cosmo woman.

437
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:24,230
I know this is difficult,
but if you don't fill out these forms...

438
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:25,856
You'll do what?

439
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:28,401
I'd like to hear
in your most condescending tone...

440
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:31,654
what my punishment will be
for not filling out these forms.

441
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:35,908
Are there bamboo shoots involved?
Some dark, deep hole in the ground?

442
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,702
Rats nibbling at my toes?

443
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:42,206
Okay, we're supposed to follow
the blue line around the corner...

444
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:44,291
and then we should be...

445
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,753
Where's The Scarecrow
when you need him?

446
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:51,799
- We have to ask someone else.
- No! We just have to pick one!

447
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:54,885
We can't just
wander around here aimlessly.

448
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:57,513
Somewhere in this hospital
are my mother and my father.

449
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:59,265
I know I don't get along with them...

450
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:02,351
but there has to be some sort of intuition,
some blood bond...

451
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,937
- that will somehow lead me to them.
- That's crazy.

452
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,024
- My great-uncle founded this hospital...
- And that's Emily.

453
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:11,819
...you insensitive paper peddler!
His portrait is hanging in the lobby.

454
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:14,363
It's right above the sign
that says 'Founder'!

455
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:19,702
What's going on? How is he?

456
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,662
You came.

457
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:25,082
- Of course I came. How's Dad?
- That's what I'm trying to find out.

458
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:28,002
But this woman keeps pestering me
with idiotic questions...

459
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:30,588
like what's the number
of my insurance policy.

460
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:34,216
- I need to get this information.
- You need to get sensitivity training.

461
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,260
What if I fill out this information...

462
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,971
and you can go find someone
who can tell us how my dad is?

463
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:40,681
- I'm not...
- Or I can go...

464
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,810
and you can stay here and continue
to discuss this with my mother.

465
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:48,731
- I'll go.
- Thank you.

466
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:55,112
- You got rid of her.
- Yes. Tell me what happened.

467
00:26:55,362 --> 00:26:57,198
- That was amazing.
- Mom, please.

468
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:58,699
I don't know what happened.

469
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,453
He was hot, and he went to turn down
the thermostat, and then...

470
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,455
- Were you on a date?
- What?

471
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,790
- You have an escort.
- No, it's Luke.

472
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:09,251
Which is her way of saying
we weren't on a date.

473
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,962
- I didn't mean it like that.
- How am I supposed to know?

474
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:14,673
- It's Friday night. You're here with a man.
- With Luke.

475
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:17,134
It's not insane to assume
a date was involved.

476
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,930
You're right, it's entirely possible
that I was out on a date.

477
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:22,014
Just not with me.

478
00:27:22,097 --> 00:27:25,643
I was eating at Luke's, I got the message.
He gave me a ride. End of story.

479
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:28,020
- Is Dr. Reynolds here?
- Joshua got here a while ago.

480
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:30,731
He was supposed to be back
the minute he knew something.

481
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:31,815
Let's go find him.

482
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:34,109
You can't find him. You can't find anyone.

483
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:36,570
Everyone keeps disappearing
behind those doors.

484
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,322
Come on, let's go.

485
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:44,161
I didn't know you could do that.

486
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,871
I'll wait here.

487
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:53,837
I gave your mom a ride.
We weren't on a date.

488
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:55,798
Okay.

489
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:58,676
She and your grandmother went back
to find a doctor.

490
00:27:58,717 --> 00:28:00,719
Did they find out anything else
about Grandpa?

491
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:03,681
I don't think so.
Give your mom some time back there.

492
00:28:03,722 --> 00:28:05,891
I bet she'll find something out.

493
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,477
- Thanks for bringing her.
- You're welcome.

494
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,853
You okay?

495
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:14,316
- I don't want him to die.
- You tell him that when you see him.

496
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,360
People like to hear that.

497
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:24,285
It was horrible. It happened so fast.

498
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,080
He'll come out of the testing room
any minute, so hang in there.

499
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,331
Where's Grandma?

500
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,959
Kicking some patient
out of the room with the good view.

501
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,961
- Really?
- I hope they get him unhooked fast.

502
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:36,380
Otherwise he'll go without
the life-support machine.

503
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:39,174
- How long before they bring him back?
- Very soon.

504
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:42,094
- I'd like to do something.
- Like rollerblade?

505
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:45,055
Like get some coffee
or make phone calls...

506
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:47,307
or do something
that isn't standing here waiting.

507
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:50,102
Okay. As partial as I am to the phone...

508
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:52,021
I'm voting for the get coffee idea.

509
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:53,439
Okay, good.

510
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:56,442
- Luke, tea?
- Peppermint, preferably.

511
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,193
I'll be right back.

512
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,615
He's gonna be fine.

513
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:06,201
- I was just getting to know him.
- I know.

514
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:08,579
- I don't want him to...
- He's not.

515
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:10,748
Go get your coffee.

516
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,797
- Oh, man.
- You were very brave for her.

517
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:21,759
It's my turn.

518
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:23,343
This sucks.

519
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,262
Come on, you gotta think positive here.

520
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:27,306
Bright side, good thoughts.

521
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:29,141
Rainbows, unicorns.

522
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:32,936
Clowns. Little, cute...

523
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,731
furry...

524
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:37,941
- Okay, I'm out.
- Thank God.

525
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:41,570
We've secured him the room...

526
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:43,906
but the pillows
are completely unacceptable.

527
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:46,825
I'm gonna see if I can find some down ones
and some slippers.

528
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:48,410
We'll be here.

529
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:55,125
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just not real big on hospitals.

530
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:59,171
The smell, people being wheeled by
with tubes sticking out of them.

531
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:01,131
Drainage fluids, gaping holes.

532
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:04,468
- Listen, why don't you go home?
- You want me to go?

533
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,553
- You don't look so good.
- Thanks.

534
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:09,139
That's not what I meant.
You always look good.

535
00:30:09,223 --> 00:30:12,142
- Yeah?
- I meant you always look healthy.

536
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:13,310
Okay.

537
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:15,813
But you don't look so healthy now.
You look...

538
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:16,939
- Unhealthy.
- Yes.

539
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:18,106
Okay.

540
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:20,359
What?

541
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:23,320
So I said you look good.
We're not in fifth grade.

542
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:25,405
'You look good. ' Big deal.

543
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,910
Stop staring at me.

544
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:37,501
See? That's what you get for being cocky.

545
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:46,969
How is he?

546
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:50,305
- He's a little groggy right now.
- What's going on? How were the tests?

547
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:53,183
The doctor'll have to tell you that.
I'm just a transport guy.

548
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:54,601
When is the doctor coming out?

549
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:58,021
I'm not sure, but you can go on
with your dad until he gets here.

550
00:30:58,063 --> 00:30:59,982
- Go ahead. I'm good.
- That's okay.

551
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,859
I'm gonna go find my mom and Rory
and tell them he's back.

552
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:05,445
- I can tell them when they get here.
- That's okay.

553
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,864
I think they'd like to know now.

554
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:11,201
- You almost ran me over.
- Good thing we're in a hospital.

555
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:13,954
- Where were you going?
- To find you. They brought Dad up.

556
00:31:14,037 --> 00:31:15,205
- When?
- Just now.

557
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:18,375
- How is he? Did you talk to him?
- No, I was coming to find you.

558
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:22,129
- Come on.
- Go ahead, I'm gonna go find Rory.

559
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:23,463
- Fine.
- Okay.

560
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,340
I could look for Rory.

561
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:27,718
- No, that's okay. I'll do it.
- I thought so.

562
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,344
Look, it's Rory.

563
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:32,347
The coffee machine was jammed,
so I got chicken soup and PEZ.

564
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:34,725
- I was coming to look for you.
- Is everything okay?

565
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:37,561
They just brought Grandpa back up.
He's in Room 202.

566
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:41,189
- Come on.
- You go ahead. I have to make a call.

567
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,567
- Hurry up.
- I'll meet you there.

568
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,402
- Who are you gonna go find now?
- Stop.

569
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:47,404
How about Jimmy Hoffa?
That'll keep you busy.

570
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:50,073
- Stop.
- You can't avoid going in there forever.

571
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:52,367
I'm not avoiding anything.
I'm gonna find coffee.

572
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,619
- The machine's jammed.
- There are other machines.

573
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:58,040
- Admit you're afraid.
- You've no idea what you're talking about.

574
00:31:58,123 --> 00:31:59,750
- The truth hurts.
- You know what hurts?

575
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,252
Having a screwdriver
jammed in the side of your head.

576
00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:03,378
What?

577
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,796
Oh, my God!

578
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:10,302
'Year-end optimism
in recent earnings reports...

579
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:14,097
'have pushed shares of
the telecommunications giant above $65.'

580
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,099
Rubbish.

581
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:20,437
'However, some experts say
that the stock is dangerously overvalued. '

582
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:24,191
How are we doing?

583
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,777
We're done with the front page
of The Financial Times...

584
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,322
- and all of The Wall Street Journal.
- Very good progress.

585
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:33,116
Why don't you
save the rest of the paper till later?

586
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,284
Okay.

587
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:39,039
If I hug you is it gonna hurt?

588
00:32:39,122 --> 00:32:40,916
Pain is part of life.

589
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,714
This little girl likes you.

590
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:49,758
She has good taste.

591
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:58,141
- Where's Mom?
- Looking for coffee.

592
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:01,061
- What are you doing?
- Staring at my shoes.

593
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,313
Okay, carry on.

594
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:12,155
I finally found you decent pillows.
They're not down, but they give a little.

595
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,908
- We need to talk.
- Can you lift your head at all?

596
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:17,327
- This is serious.
- Just a little.

597
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:21,665
There is a key in my top desk drawer.

598
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:24,167
- Better, yes?
- It's to the safe.

599
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:25,293
One more time.

600
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:28,672
All of our stock information is in there...

601
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:31,550
plus all of the insurance information.

602
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:34,302
If I could just find you
some different sheets.

603
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:38,181
Our will is in my lower left drawer.
Dennis has a copy if there's a problem.

604
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:40,141
I could get Dava to bring some from home.

605
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:42,727
Emily, this is serious.
We have to be practical.

606
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:44,437
I'm gonna have Dava get those sheets.

607
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:46,690
- Listen to me. If I die...
- No!

608
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:51,152
Richard Gilmore, there may be
many things happening in this hospital...

609
00:33:51,236 --> 00:33:53,029
but your dying is not one of them.

610
00:33:53,071 --> 00:33:54,155
- But...
- No!

611
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:57,492
I did not sign on to your dying,
and it is not going to happen.

612
00:33:57,534 --> 00:34:00,161
Not tonight, not for a very long time.

613
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:02,497
In fact, I demand to go first.

614
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:04,749
Do I make myself clear?

615
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,459
Yes, Emily.

616
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:09,045
You may go first.

617
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:10,672
Good.

618
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:13,341
I'm gonna get you those sheets.

619
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:27,063
No luck?

620
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:29,316
I think I'm wearing it down.

621
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,026
You're pathetic.

622
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:34,779
- Is the doctor back?
- Not yet.

623
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:39,200
- You had a visitor tonight.
- Yeah? Who?

624
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:41,953
- Narcolepsy Boy.
- Dean came over?

625
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:43,163
Yeah.

626
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:46,166
He pulled the old
tapping-on-the-window bit.

627
00:34:46,624 --> 00:34:49,669
- Were you mean?
- Excuse me, I am never mean.

628
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:51,212
You were mean.

629
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:53,757
- He told me nothing happened.
- Nothing did.

630
00:34:53,798 --> 00:34:56,217
- I know.
- You do? Really?

631
00:34:56,343 --> 00:35:00,680
There are only two things
that I totally trust in this entire world:

632
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,267
The fact that I'll never be able to
understand what Charo is saying...

633
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:07,103
no matter how long
she lives in this country...

634
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:08,438
and you.

635
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:10,190
Hopefully not in that order.

636
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:13,401
You have to understand
the major panic factor that went on there.

637
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:16,196
I really do, and I'm so sorry.

638
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:18,907
Nothing like that will happen again,
I swear.

639
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:21,284
- Don't swear.
- Why not?

640
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:23,870
- Because you are your mother's daughter.
- Meaning?

641
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:25,413
It means things can happen...

642
00:35:25,497 --> 00:35:27,832
even when you
don't really mean for them to happen.

643
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,417
They will not happen.

644
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:31,586
Okay.

645
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:34,631
I hated going to that party tonight
without you.

646
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:37,634
I hated you going to that party tonight
without me.

647
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:41,471
- How were the apple tarts?
- Grandma didn't make them this year.

648
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:43,014
- Really?
- Yeah.

649
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:44,641
- That's weird.
- I know.

650
00:35:44,724 --> 00:35:46,267
- Are you lying?
- Through my teeth.

651
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:47,435
Good girl.

652
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:54,109
- Hello.
- Hi.

653
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:59,989
- Lf you don't mind, I think I need to just...
- Sure. Sit, please.

654
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:03,868
- How is he?
- You know, he's...

655
00:36:06,371 --> 00:36:07,831
I don't know.

656
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,793
That's a nice tie.

657
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:14,003
It's Brooks Brothers.

658
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:16,840
It was bothering him tonight.

659
00:36:16,923 --> 00:36:20,468
I told him not to loosen it.
I wanted him to look nice for our guests.

660
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:22,053
So he didn't.

661
00:36:22,846 --> 00:36:24,264
And then...

662
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:29,060
The paramedics took it off him
on the way here.

663
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:32,063
I just haven't been able to put it down yet.

664
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:35,149
I must sound crazy.

665
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:40,780
I've kept my father's entire store
just the way he left it.

666
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:44,200
- Really?
- I turned it into a diner.

667
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:48,788
But I kept all his stuff on the walls,
his pictures in the office.

668
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:51,165
Even the Hardware sign.

669
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:55,920
I'm sure he would've appreciated having
his life's work being honored like that.

670
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:58,548
He would have called me a damn fool.

671
00:37:03,636 --> 00:37:06,556
I don't know what Lorelai's told you
about her father.

672
00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:08,641
I can certainly imagine...

673
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:11,561
But he's a very good man.

674
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:14,230
He always did the right thing
for his family.

675
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:16,232
That's what she told me.

676
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:22,363
What exactly is going on
between the two of you?

677
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:24,407
Nothing.

678
00:37:25,158 --> 00:37:26,409
Really.

679
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:30,538
We're friends, that's it.

680
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:34,083
You're idiots, the both of you.

681
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:38,421
- There you are. Where have you been?
- Coffee hunt.

682
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:41,424
- What's going on?
- Your mother called me an idiot.

683
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:43,217
You must've sucked up good.

684
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,303
I'm gonna go wash my face.

685
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:57,440
So what you gonna do?

686
00:38:02,278 --> 00:38:05,990
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- I'll be here.

687
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:53,579
...I've heard for such a long time.
How are you doing, darling?

688
00:38:54,956 --> 00:38:58,709
It looks like we're going to be
stuck with you for a while longer.

689
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:00,419
It was just a touch of angina.

690
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:03,422
- But you have to watch your diet.
- That's gonna be important.

691
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:05,633
No more red meat, heavy desserts.

692
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:09,345
- You're gonna have to exercise regularly.
- Golf doesn't count.

693
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:10,513
Can he go home?

694
00:39:10,596 --> 00:39:13,182
We'd like to keep him overnight though,
just to be sure.

695
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:16,811
- But he's fine.
- As long as he does what he's told, yes.

696
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:22,108
I heard. Everything's okay.

697
00:39:22,191 --> 00:39:25,528
Yeah. They're gonna keep him overnight...

698
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,865
but he's gonna be fine.

699
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:35,413
Okay. See, here's where the guy...

700
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:39,375
is supposed to give the girl
his handkerchief, but I don't have one.

701
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:43,880
And plus, I find the practice
a little revolting, so...

702
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,257
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

703
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:48,009
- Yeah.
- All right.

704
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:50,386
I got this for you.

705
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:53,890
- Where did you get that?
- Nurses' lounge.

706
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:58,144
What? You're not the only one
who can flirt.

707
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:00,855
The door was open.

708
00:40:01,939 --> 00:40:04,442
- Thank you.
- Anything else I can do?

709
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:08,237
- Could you take Rory home?
- Yeah, sure.

710
00:40:08,446 --> 00:40:10,031
What about you?

711
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:12,909
I'm gonna stick around here for a while...

712
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,952
and make sure everything's settled.

713
00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:18,289
- You take her, and I'll drive the jeep back.
- Okay.

714
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:21,667
- He's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

715
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:25,880
I think it was those financial papers
that really did the trick.

716
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:29,550
Luke's gonna take you home.
I'm gonna hang out here for a while.

717
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:31,844
- I'll stay, too.
- No, go. Call Dean.

718
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:35,681
Talk mushy and then spend an hour
arguing over who's gonna hang up first.

719
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:38,017
- You're gross.
- I'll call you later.

720
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,896
Okay. Tell him goodbye for me,
and tell him I'll come back tomorrow.

721
00:40:41,937 --> 00:40:43,773
- Okay, I will.
- Bye.

722
00:40:46,942 --> 00:40:49,403
Walk fast and look straight ahead.

723
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:02,208
- Thanks.
- I'll call you.

724
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:07,254
- He's almost asleep.
- Good.

725
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:12,593
- Where's Rory?
- I sent her home with Luke.

726
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,303
What about you?

727
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:18,474
I thought I'd stick around
in case anybody needed anything.

728
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:20,726
- Really?
- Not you.

729
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,395
You obviously don't need anything.

730
00:41:22,478 --> 00:41:25,564
But somebody somewhere in this hospital
might need something...

731
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:28,818
and I'm gonna be the person
who gets it for them.

732
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:32,446
Would you like to go to the cafeteria
for something to eat?

733
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:35,157
Yes, maybe somebody in the cafeteria
will need something.

734
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:36,242
Oh, dear.

735
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:38,536
And won't they feel lucky
when they see me?

736
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:42,289
'I needed something, and there you were. '
It's gonna be a great moment.

737
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:57,221
- Hello.
- Hey, how's your dad?

738
00:41:57,304 --> 00:41:58,556
Better...

739
00:41:58,973 --> 00:42:02,518
though he says life is not life
unless it includes a steak.

740
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:05,813
- How come you're not out with everyone?
- I have some things to do.

741
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:09,358
- Right. Anyway, this is for you.
- What's it for?

742
00:42:09,775 --> 00:42:12,653
Just thank you, Christmas, whatever.

743
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:16,407
- Christmas isn't for two weeks.
- Do we really have to do this again?

744
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,911
I just thought, God forbid...

745
00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:25,457
something happens to that one,
you might need a spare. Here.

746
00:42:33,966 --> 00:42:35,968
Does that look wrong.

747
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:39,555
There.

748
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:42,850
Turn out the lights.

749
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:46,228
For what? It's not even
the real procession. It's just the rehearsal.

750
00:42:46,312 --> 00:42:48,564
So? It's pretty.

751
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:51,567
Why do they need to rehearse it?
It's the same thing every year.

752
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,527
Come on, Luke, please?

753
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:02,953
It's hard to imagine
living somewhere else, isn't it?

754
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,914
Thanks for the hat.

755
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:06,957
You're welcome.

756
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,084
Looks good on you.

757
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:11,086
Good how?

758
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:13,881
Just watch the procession.
