1
00:00:00,121 --> 00:00:02,721
Hey, punch me in the stomach.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,332
What ?

3
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:05,057
Real quick --
Jab, jab. Not too hard.

4
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:06,647
Just enough to cause a
little internal bleeding.

5
00:00:06,676 --> 00:00:07,800
That sounds pretty hard.

6
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:08,780
Yeah, true.

7
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,177
Plus, internal bleeding is internal,
which means it can't be proven.

8
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:14,450
And unless my mother sees blood,
there's no way she's gonna let you

9
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:15,681
take me to the hospital.
You're right.

10
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,705
You're gonna have to punch me in
the face. Real quick, jab, jab.

11
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:19,433
I am not going to
punch you in the face.

12
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:20,850
Why? I'll heal.

13
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:22,928
And I'd much rather spend the
night in the germy emergency room

14
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:25,463
getting 8 to 10 stitches
than go in there for dinner.

15
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:27,170
Plus, it'll give me
a really groovy scar.

16
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:29,080
- I've always wanted a groovy scar.
- Mom.

17
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,709
What? It'd be such a
great conversation piece.

18
00:00:30,743 --> 00:00:32,042
"Where did you get
that groovy scar?"

19
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:34,525
"Oh, my daughter dropkicked
me for no apparent reason."

20
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,430
She's totally psycho.

21
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:36,676
Oh, so now I'm dropkicking you?

22
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,765
Giving you options. You didn't
like the whole jab, jab thing.

23
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,874
We haven't had dinner
with them in three weeks.

24
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:42,121
Suck it up. We're going in.

25
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:43,763
Hey, you didn't make it through
the last dinner, which means

26
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:46,229
technically, you've had four weeks,
which means you owe me one.

27
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:48,577
- I stayed for cocktail hour.
- That's the best part.

28
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,121
I can't help that it's
at the beginning.

29
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,942
Okay, fine,
then you stay through dessert,

30
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:53,754
and I'll leave early to
go spend time with Logan.

31
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,510
- Oh, I miss Logan.
- Yeah, me too.

32
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,515
Let's talk about him
for four or five hours.

33
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,406
- We're going inside.
- No! Gonna be horrible.

34
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:00,458
They're always horrible.

35
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:03,336
No, it's gonna be horribler
because of the whole Luke thing.

36
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:05,887
Doesn't your mom already kind of
know because of the house debacle?

37
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:07,900
No, she suspects,
but she doesn't know know.

38
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:08,908
I'm gonna have to tell them.

39
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,746
Well, just tell them real quick,
like ripping a band-aid off.

40
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,318
Like ripping a band-aid off
that's been superglued, stapled,

41
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:15,890
and surgically
embedded in my arm.

42
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:18,478
Just tell them,
and then we can move on.

43
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,676
We can talk about more pleasant things,
like the middle east.

44
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,199
I don't know how they're
gonna come at me, you know.

45
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:24,513
I know they're gonna come at me,
but I don't know how.

46
00:01:24,527 --> 00:01:27,023
I mean, it could be guilt,
pity, anger, contempt.

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,081
They have so many options.

48
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:30,631
In all likelihood, it will be
a combination of all of those.

49
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,309
I don't want the whole
night to be about Luke.

50
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,729
It won't be. Don't worry.

51
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:36,231
Just put it out there,
and then when they attack you,

52
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,312
whatever angle they're coming from,
I will deflect.

53
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:40,011
- How will you deflect?
- Well, I don't know.

54
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,834
Maybe I will talk
about Bangalore.

55
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:43,327
You know a lot about Bangalore?

56
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:45,764
Don't you?
Bangalore? Outsourcing?

57
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,624
You know, when you call customer
service, you're almost always talking

58
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,098
to some nice dude in India
who speaks perfect english.

59
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:51,165
Don't you read Time magazine?

60
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,804
It doesn't seem like
a rich subject area.

61
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,338
- Yeah.
- No! Uhh!

62
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:57,185
Oh, I know. You tell them
you're converting to judaism,

63
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,374
and that will throw the
friday-night-dinner thing in jeopardy.

64
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:00,937
There you go.

65
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:03,313
Hello.

66
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:04,677
- Hi.
- Hello.

67
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,997
Come in. May I take your coats?

68
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,634
Well, okay. Here you go.

69
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:12,002
- That's a pretty dress.
- Thank you.

70
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:13,470
Oh.

71
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,534
- You okay there?
- I'm fine.

72
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:16,635
Right this way.

73
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:17,951
- Weird.
- So weird.

74
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:19,236
- It's a child, right?
- Pretty sure.

75
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:21,335
Maybe mom has run out of
adults who will work for her.

76
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,303
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

77
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:24,941
Good  evening, Rory. Lorelai.

78
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:26,322
Hi, grandma. Hi, grandpa.

79
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:29,314
Well done, Charlotte. C.C. guest
couldn't have done it better herself.

80
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:30,857
Thank you, Mrs. Gilmore.

81
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:34,751
Lorelai, Rory, allow me to
introduce Charlotte Courtwright.

82
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:37,350
Charlotte, this is Lorelai
Gilmore and Rory Gilmore,

83
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:38,836
my granddaughter
and her mother.

84
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:39,874
It's a pleasure to meet you.

85
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,467
Oh, a pleasure.

86
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,204
Hi.

87
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,252
Charlotte's grandparents, Arthur and
Beverly, are dear friends of ours.

88
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:48,563
In fact, it was the Courtwrights who
put us up for membership at blackledge.

89
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:49,568
Isn't that right, Richard?

90
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:51,412
Indeed it is,
although I have a feeling

91
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:54,539
Arthur did that just so he could
humiliate me on the links every sunday.

92
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,965
Hell of a golfer,
your grandfather.

93
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:59,045
Yes, he used to be scratch,
but now he's a 3.

94
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,115
You know, "Charlotte's web"
is one of my favorite books.

95
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,948
Spiders talking to pigs.
What could be better then that?

96
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,532
Can I offer anyone a cocktail?

97
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,946
Uh... okay. Sure.
Is that legal?

98
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:08,674
She'll have a
martini with a twist.

99
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,139
Scotch on the
rocks for Richard.

100
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,587
"G" and "T" for me. Rory?

101
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:13,094
Just a club soda, please.

102
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,569
Would you like that straight
up or on the rocks?

103
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,594
Straight up. Thanks.

104
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,141
You're never too young to
learn to make a martini.

105
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:22,310
Who is that?

106
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:23,855
I told you.

107
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,232
It's the Courtwrights'
granddaughter, Charlotte.

108
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,171
Why is she taking our coats
and pouring us drinks?

109
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:29,734
Did you win her
in a poker game?

110
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:32,439
Your mother has been dragooned
by her colleagues at the D.A.R.

111
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:35,172
to lend her expertise to this
year's summer cotillion.

112
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:36,937
It's been quite
a responsibility.

113
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:40,083
But Eliza Appleton insisted that
there was simply no one she knew

114
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:42,680
who was better suited to preparing
these girls for society living.

115
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:44,015
I could hardly say no.

116
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:44,674
Here we are.

117
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,026
- Oh. Thank you, Charlotte.
- Thank you.

118
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:49,492
- Martini straight up.
- Oh. Thanks.

119
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:50,393
Thank you.

120
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,606
So, nothing for you?
You driving tonight?

121
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,632
Oh, Lorelai, I'm only 10.

122
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:57,680
In any case, Charlotte missed last
week's session on table manners,

123
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,375
so we've decided to make
tonight's dinner a makeup class.

124
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,706
I'm awfully sorry about that,
Mrs. Gilmore.

125
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:06,120
My grandparents took me to a
Count Basie tribute at Tanglewood.

126
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,202
Charlotte, you might have noticed
that the ice cubes in my glass

127
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:09,353
have already melted.

128
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:12,451
There's a whole ice bucket up there.
There's no need to be so stingy.

129
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:13,935
I'm sorry.

130
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,121
For future reference.
It's obvious too late now.

131
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,159
This is your chance.
Get out while you still can.

132
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,328
I can show you all the
good escape routes.

133
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:25,838
Mrs. Gilmore warned me you'd
be full of smart remarks.

134
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:22,309
Now, tonight we'll be dining
with service � la russe,

135
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,439
which has nothing to do with russians --
thank god --

136
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:27,361
because in my experience, their
table manners are nothing to emulate.

137
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:30,967
All it means is that the servers
will be passing each course in turn

138
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:32,993
instead of plopping all the
food on the table at once,

139
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:34,642
like some mukluk picnic.

140
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:37,172
Now, it is the duty of the gentleman
to help a lady to her seat.

141
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:38,633
- Richard, would you?
- It is my pleasure.

142
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:39,602
We can seat ourselves.

143
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:42,957
Yeah, seating us is more of a privilege,
not a duty.

144
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,761
Now, immediately upon sitting,

145
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:47,377
one should place one's
napkin in one's lap.

146
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,378
And, mind you,
no need for a flourish.

147
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,797
The ability to use a napkin
is nothing to brag about.

148
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:54,541
The table looks
beautiful, grandma.

149
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:55,454
Well, thank you, Rory.

150
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:56,814
What's with all the forks?

151
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,780
Every piece of silverware
has a purpose.

152
00:05:58,797 --> 00:06:02,070
You simply work from the outermost
utensil in towards your plate.

153
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:03,527
Can you name each
of these forks?

154
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,905
Each one of these forks
is gonna take 20 minutes.

155
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:07,507
And then the fish fork,

156
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:09,409
and then the entr�e fork,

157
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:11,977
and then --
is this the dessert?

158
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,338
Oh, wait --
it's for the roast course, isn't it?

159
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:16,102
Exactly.  Very good, Charlotte.

160
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,847
Hey, you're gonna wow
them at your cotillion.

161
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:19,245
Did you ever attend
a cotillion?

162
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:22,076
No, I haven't, actually,
but I had a coming-out party.

163
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,820
And I totally
supported her decision.

164
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:25,690
She shouldn't have to
hide her love for women.

165
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:27,925
Lorelai, there's nothing
funny about being a lesbian.

166
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:29,642
I'm sure you'll have
fun at your cotillion.

167
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:31,571
I'm very much looking
forward to it.

168
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:34,417
Oh, don't get too excited.
Cotillions are not fun parties.

169
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,285
They're boring rituals to train
a whole new generation of snobs.

170
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,685
And how exactly would you know?

171
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,591
Lorelai never actually
attended a cotillion.

172
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:44,498
You don't have to jump off the Empire
State Building to know it's gonna hurt.

173
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:46,801
Um, this looks delicious,
Mrs. Gilmore.

174
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:48,889
It's just a simple
potage au cresson.

175
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:50,913
I thought you were gonna
rip off the band-aid.

176
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,416
The kid threw me off. I'm looking
for an opening. I'll find it.

177
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,721
...to ladle the broth
away from our bodies.

178
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,145
Rory, how has the summer
been treating you so far?

179
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,360
It's treating me very well so far,
thank you.

180
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:02,759
Are you relaxing in preparation
for your senior year?

181
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:04,272
Well, I've been doing
some part-time work.

182
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,727
Paris opened this business,
a tutoring business,

183
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:09,012
and it prepares people
for the S.A.T.s.

184
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,399
It's kind of like the
princeton review but meaner.

185
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,876
Sounds very enterprising.

186
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,467
And what about your
social calendar?

187
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,513
Do you have anything
particularly exciting planned?

188
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:19,246
Not really.
Logan's in London, so...

189
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,996
Logan is Rory's boyfriend.
He's a Huntzberger.

190
00:07:22,202 --> 00:07:23,838
How is Logan enjoying London?

191
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:26,054
I think he likes it.
He's working a lot

192
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,942
and meeting different department heads,
getting situated,

193
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:30,589
learning to talk british,
you know.

194
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:33,524
Lorelai, how's summer with you?
Anything new?

195
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:37,120
Um... we planted some
pansies at the Dragonfly,

196
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:39,039
in the back there.
They look good.

197
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:43,468
And, um,
I finally bought a new dvd player.

198
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:45,360
And...

199
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,748
Luke and I broke up.

200
00:07:47,762 --> 00:07:49,637
Did you? That's too bad.

201
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,221
Now, Charlotte,
when the conversation lags,

202
00:07:57,236 --> 00:08:00,311
a good guest ought to be prepared
to introduce a new topic.

203
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:02,823
Keep it light --
no politics, no religion.

204
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:04,004
My little trick?

205
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:05,347
Just think of things
that you've read

206
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,762
in the middle three sections of
the sunday New York Times --

207
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,910
Travel, arts and leisure,
sunday styles --

208
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:11,712
And forget the rest
of the paper exists.

209
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,409
Look, it's all right.

210
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,519
- What is?
- We can talk about the breakup.

211
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:17,689
I'm sure you have
thoughts on the subject,

212
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:20,181
and why don't we get it
all out in the open now

213
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:22,360
so we can move on
with our lives?

214
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:23,653
I've moved on.

215
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,707
Richard, anything
you'd like to add?

216
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,529
I can't think of a thing.

217
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,064
All right, then.

218
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:30,857
Isn't it interesting
how they're renovating

219
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:32,860
so many of the old
paradores in Spain?

220
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:35,256
It's funny you should mention that
because last week at the club,

221
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,110
Chick Walsh told me
that he and Mary

222
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:39,901
stayed at this extraordinary
old castle near Madrid.

223
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:42,153
Where was it? Um, uh, Lerma.

224
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,717
Lerma? How nice.

225
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,826
Excuse me. Uh, what's going on?

226
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,497
Why are we talking about Lerma?

227
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,546
- It's a town in Spain.
- Yes, I understand geography,

228
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,878
but why are you avoiding
the subject of my breakup?

229
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:54,726
Honestly, Lorelai, I see no point
in continuing this conversation.

230
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,480
We couldn't possibly say anything right,
so why say anything at all?

231
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,564
That's not true.

232
00:08:58,578 --> 00:08:59,723
It absolutely is.

233
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,275
You could say something.
You could try.

234
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,830
You could say,
"I'm sorry, Lorelai.

235
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,354
This must be a very
hard time for you."

236
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:06,023
Well, I am sorry, Lorelai.

237
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,777
I'm sure this is a very
hard time for you.

238
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:08,911
That's it? That's all?

239
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,561
I just said what
you said to say.

240
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:12,640
You don't have anything
of your own to add?

241
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:14,414
I'm  sure whatever Luke did --

242
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,594
See? It's so interesting,
because you blame it on him,

243
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:17,820
and you don't even
know the whole story.

244
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:18,426
Mom...

245
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:19,631
I knew we couldn't
talk about this.

246
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,168
I should have claimed
I had laryngitis.

247
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:23,776
Lorelai, your mother is
simply expressing our regrets

248
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,436
that you've ended your
relationship with Luke.

249
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:27,123
I hardly see how
that's offensive.

250
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:28,800
Fine.

251
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,120
Only that's not true.
You never liked Luke.

252
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,651
You never showed him
anything but total contempt.

253
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,993
That's not true.
I played golf with Luke.

254
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:37,779
Once.

255
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,447
We were planning on buying
the two of you a house.

256
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:42,402
Doesn't the fact that we were willing
to spend an enormous amount of money

257
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,195
on a wedding present
count for anything?

258
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,125
So, that's what
you're mad about?

259
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:47,309
You're mad about the enormous amount
of money you might have wasted?

260
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:47,914
Mom!

261
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:49,218
That's not what I was saying.

262
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,330
Well, you implied it.

263
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:52,958
- Lorelai, this--
- Bangalore! Bangalore!

264
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:54,620
Bangalore.

265
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,678
- Hi.
- Morning, Ace.

266
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:05,380
Thanks.

267
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:06,578
How's your day going?

268
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:09,378
My day hasn't started yet.
How was your yesterday?

269
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:11,141
I'm still sleepy.

270
00:10:11,158 --> 00:10:12,506
I can let you go back to sleep.

271
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,356
No, no, I'm up.

272
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,553
I'm up.

273
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,107
What  happened yesterday?

274
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:18,852
My yesterday or your yesterday?

275
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:19,639
Either one.

276
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:21,921
Let's see...
I had a scone for breakfast --

277
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,810
not as dry as monday's, but I still
think there's room for improvement.

278
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,416
And then I went into a meeting with
about 18 different department heads,

279
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,990
all of whom I believe
are named Nigel,

280
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:31,511
and that meeting lasted
for about nine hours.

281
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:32,864
Was it a cranberry scone?

282
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:33,842
Blueberry.

283
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:35,196
Those are my favorite kind.

284
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,943
Your turn.

285
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,534
Well, I'm tutoring
this new kid, Benji.

286
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:42,024
And, oh, it was really funny
because he kept misusing this word.

287
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:44,297
I don't remember what word it was,
but it'll come to me.

288
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:46,818
Anyway, he kept misusing it,
and I didn't want to correct him

289
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,488
'cause I didn't want
him to feel embarrassed.

290
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,347
But then he messed up
on the work sheet,

291
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:53,821
and then he realized all by himself
that he had misused the word.

292
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:56,409
I guess it wasn't
funny "ha ha."

293
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,788
It was more funny "you
had to be there."

294
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:00,188
That's okay.

295
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:02,213
Are you working?

296
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:03,621
Just I.M.'ing.

297
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,478
If you have to go --

298
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,350
No, I just have to let my assistant
know I'm on the phone with you

299
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:09,722
so I'll be 2 minutes
late to the meeting.

300
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,198
I don't want you to be
late for your meeting.

301
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:12,876
It's no problem. I don't mind.

302
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:15,687
Well, now I feel like I have really to
come up with something great to talk about.

303
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,095
No pressure.

304
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,020
- What?
- Nothing.

305
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,345
Now you really do have to go.

306
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,148
Well, yeah.

307
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:24,432
"Philanthropic."

308
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:25,286
What?

309
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:27,778
Philanthropic, that was the
word that Benji kept misusing.

310
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:28,998
He kept saying "philantropic."

311
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:30,390
He thought it meant
"tropical." It was funny.

312
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,576
- I'll call you tonight.
- My tonight or your tonight?

313
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:33,737
Got to go, Ace.

314
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:35,414
Okay. Bye.

315
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,645
Are you enjoying
your breakfast?

316
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:52,419
I don't know if
I like pop-tarts.

317
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:54,078
Did you fall on your head
while you were sleeping?

318
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,369
I don't know. Do I like this?
Is this something I like?

319
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,681
So, you fell on your head,
and now you have

320
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,890
some kind of very specific amnesia.
Is that it?

321
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:03,389
I mean, last night I was dreading mom
and dad's reaction to the breakup, right?

322
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:05,231
Right. Dread, dread.
I remember.

323
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:07,504
Then they didn't react --
not one bit.

324
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,509
It's almost like the absence
of their reaction was worse

325
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,455
than any freak-out
they could have had.

326
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,480
Okay. Sure.

327
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:14,266
Then  I thought, "why?

328
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:17,255
Why do I care if they freak out?
I mean, what do I get out of it?"

329
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,317
And then I thought,
"maybe their freak-outs

330
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:21,553
are like some kind of compass for me,
you know,

331
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,661
like, I know I'm doing what I want
to do if it freaks them out."

332
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:26,973
And then I thought,
"what if I don't want to do

333
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:28,917
what I want to do
because I want to do it,

334
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:30,914
but because they
don't want me to?"

335
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:31,614
Huh?

336
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:33,731
I mean, what if I don't like
what I like because I like it,

337
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,478
but because my mother
doesn't like it

338
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:36,734
and doesn't want me to like it?

339
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:40,025
What if I don't actually
like the music that I like

340
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,709
or the movies or the
clothes or the men?

341
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:44,942
What if I don't like
what I seem to like?

342
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,340
- Ah, hence the pop-tart.
- Yes. Hence.

343
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:49,424
I can remember the first
time I had a pop-tart.

344
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:51,150
It was at my friend
Erica Catcha's house,

345
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:52,654
and she said,
"do you want a pop-tart?"

346
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,794
And I knew my
mother would recoil

347
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,374
at the very idea of
me having a pop-tart.

348
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:58,954
I could just picture her.
"A pop-tart?!"

349
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:00,470
And so, I had one.

350
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:03,184
And I opened the
little silver wrapper,

351
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,642
and I took a bite,

352
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:07,434
and I thought nothing
had ever tasted so good.

353
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:10,963
I thought it tasted
like freedom.

354
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:13,313
It tasted like I
was my own person.

355
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,883
The pop-tart tasted
like freedom

356
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:18,109
and rebellion and independence.

357
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:20,437
Wow. That's some pop-tart.
What flavor was that?

358
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:23,575
But now I think I don't
know if I like pop-tarts.

359
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,955
What if I don't like pop-tarts?

360
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,172
Would I like pop-tarts

361
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,764
if Richard and Emily had served
me pop-tarts on a silver platter

362
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:30,921
and demanded I eat every bite?
I don't know.

363
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,474
Hey, where are
all the pop-tarts?

364
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:33,556
I've been experimenting.

365
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:34,670
You ate all the pop-tarts?

366
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:36,714
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't know if I like them!

367
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,745
Well, I hope you didn't
eat all the froot loops.

368
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,008
Hey, how was last
night's conversation?

369
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,108
- Eh.
- Eh-eh?

370
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,190
It's just these
transatlantic phone calls.

371
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:47,022
I don't know if it's the
"trans" or the "atlantic"

372
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:48,674
or the fact that it's
2:00 in the morning,

373
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:50,503
but Helen Keller
and Stephen Hawking

374
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:52,184
could have a more
connected conversation.

375
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,210
Helen Keller's dead.

376
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,673
Yeah, well, even dead,
she could do better.

377
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,918
It's just so awkward and pausy.

378
00:13:57,932 --> 00:13:59,472
And I feel like the
more I try to connect,

379
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,978
the more disconnected I feel.

380
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:02,617
And I just feel like
I'm working so hard,

381
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:04,833
but maybe I shouldn't be
having to work so hard.

382
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,200
And then I feel self-conscious,
but I shouldn't feel self-conscious,

383
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:09,280
so then I feel
self-conscious about that.

384
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,094
I don't know,
maybe it's just the salt in the ocean.

385
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:12,965
It corrodes conversations
or something.

386
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,054
Yeah. It sounds like the salt.

387
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:17,176
- Hey!
- I like pop-tarts.

388
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:29,204
Here you go, ladies.

389
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:31,131
It's the ceilings.
They're vaulted now, aren't they?

390
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,263
The ceilings aren't vaulted.

391
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:33,480
I got it, it's the curly fries.

392
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:35,783
You never used to have curly
fries here before, did you, Luke?

393
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,230
Always had curly fries.

394
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:39,446
I'm telling you,
something's different about the place.

395
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:42,084
Nothing. Nothing has changed.
It's exactly the same.

396
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:43,598
He must have done
something to the windows

397
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:45,016
'cause the light is
much better now.

398
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:47,309
Yeah, it's a lot less
gloomy than it used to be.

399
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:49,094
An identical level
of gloom, people.

400
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:51,098
I got it. You got new chairs.

401
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:53,035
I knew my butt felt
more comfortable.

402
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:54,817
Yeah, your butt feels
exactly the same, Babette.

403
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:58,204
Now, would you two can it?
I didn't change a damn thing.

404
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,314
- Hey, Rory.
- Hi, Luke.

405
00:15:03,338 --> 00:15:04,714
How's it going?

406
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:07,113
Good. I'm good. And you?

407
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:07,986
Doing good.

408
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:09,694
Glad to hear that.

409
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:11,554
Congratulations on
the reopening.

410
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:14,774
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Back to normal, I guess.

411
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,222
- New hat?
- Yeah.

412
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:19,186
So, I didn't think you were
gonna make it back this summer.

413
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:22,286
Oh, I wasn't, but then I did.

414
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:24,451
- Things change.
- Yeah.

415
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,110
So, you want a table?

416
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:30,736
No, I think I'll just take some coffee
and a muffin to go, if you have it.

417
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,556
- I have it.
- It's the curtains!

418
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:33,956
Yeah, those curtains
have always been here.

419
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:36,162
I know. I'm just saying you
used to have more curtains.

420
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:38,271
No, I never had more curtains.

421
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,976
- Hi.
- Lane, hey, come over here.

422
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,232
Hey. So? How did it go?

423
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,815
Was it hard? Did he freak out?

424
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:48,936
What are you talking about?

425
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:51,076
Zach... and the pregnancy.

426
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:53,011
Oh. That.
I haven't told him yet.

427
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:53,868
Really?

428
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:56,282
Yeah, I was,
but now I'm thinking I'm gonna wait.

429
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:58,173
Okay. For how long?

430
00:15:58,187 --> 00:15:59,651
I don't know. A couple years?

431
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:00,368
Lane!

432
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:02,345
I'm gonna tell him eventually,
just not yet.

433
00:16:02,357 --> 00:16:04,962
Besides, a lot of people
wait a full 12 weeks

434
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:06,276
before they tell anyone
they're pregnant.

435
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:07,446
Not the husband.

436
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:10,332
I just need a little more
time to adjust, you know?

437
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:13,448
I kind of want to process this
by myself a little longer.

438
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:15,550
You can wait as
long as you want.

439
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:17,516
You can wait until the baby
comes out and have her tell him.

440
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,033
- Her?
- Or him.

441
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,979
It could be a him?
Oh, god, I'm not ready for a him!

442
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:23,116
- Maybe it'll be a her.
- Who's ready for a her?!

443
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:26,367
You are. And Zach is.
You guys can do this.

444
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:27,546
Hey, you want to tell him?

445
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:29,675
One coffee. One muffin.

446
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,711
One employee
sitting at a table.

447
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:32,755
Sorry, Luke.

448
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:34,788
- Thanks, Luke. See you later.
- See you later.

449
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:37,369
- New mugs!
- Hey! Same mugs.

450
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:42,500
Wow. Somebody's
all fancy-pants.

451
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:44,302
I've never seen your
hair up like that.

452
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:46,212
I'm just trying out a new look,
seeing if I like it,

453
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:47,908
serving no master but myself.

454
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:50,509
Are you gonna try pigtails, too?
Because that's kind of my thing.

455
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:51,676
It's freeing, really.

456
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:54,966
I never realized how my mother
influenced my every decision,

457
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,712
even decisions that don't
seem like decisions,

458
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:57,843
like tying my shoes.

459
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:00,250
I mean, I've always been a fan
of the bunny ears, you know?

460
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:02,898
And this morning I
decided not to bunny-ear,

461
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:03,780
and you know what happened?

462
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:04,383
No.

463
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,385
Turns out bunny ears take a lot
longer than the regular way.

464
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,025
I saved like three
seconds this morning.

465
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,763
What does your mother have
to do with bunny ears?

466
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,296
My mother is everywhere --

467
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:14,264
in my shoes,
in my clothes, in my food.

468
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:15,661
- Your mother is here.
- In my Inn.

469
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:17,686
What do you mean? What are you
talking about? Why is my mother here?

470
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,287
She's here to taste
the menu for the tea.

471
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:21,908
Why doesn't she know
what I'm talking about?

472
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:22,760
What tea?

473
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:24,295
I thought you were
going to tell her.

474
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,012
What tea?

475
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,414
I was going to tell her.

476
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:29,127
Then I considered what it would
be like if I did not tell her,

477
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:31,028
and I thought it
might be more fun.

478
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,676
- I was right.
- What tea?

479
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,653
Lorelai, do you normally keep
your guests waiting like that?

480
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:36,426
It's very rude. Hello, Sookie.

481
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:38,317
Hi, Mrs. Gilmore. Welcome.

482
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:39,714
What tea?

483
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:41,250
There's no need to
shout, Lorelai.

484
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:43,331
I'm bringing the girls here
friday for afternoon tea

485
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:44,749
as part of their
etiquette training.

486
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:46,179
Here? Why are you
bringing them here?

487
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:47,657
Actually, I was going to
take them into the city

488
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,152
for high tea at the Pierre.

489
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,484
But the ma�tre d' at the
Pierre apparently believes

490
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:54,992
that proper high tea includes
club sandwiches and a juice bar,

491
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,793
and I simply couldn't subject
these impressionable young girls

492
00:17:57,806 --> 00:17:59,425
to such tasteless effrontery.

493
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,008
Do they even have
tea at a cotillion?

494
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,225
Don't be absurd.

495
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:05,064
As long as I have them under my wing,
I feel that it is my duty

496
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,082
to offer them as much of
my expertise as possible.

497
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,386
Last week we went
to the symphony

498
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,475
and the hopper
exhibit at the Met.

499
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,496
This week it's high tea and
"Rigoletto" at Lincoln Center.

500
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,706
Have you done that thing
where they walk around

501
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:18,863
with books on their heads?
That's always a good one.

502
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:20,524
Sookie, these are
simply divine.

503
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:23,072
It's the lemon zest.
It makes all the difference.

504
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:25,856
Although, we definitely shouldn't
serve the spinach quiche.

505
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,138
Some of the girls have braces,
and their mothers would never forgive me

506
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,814
if they spent the evening
with hideous green smiles.

507
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:34,379
Perhaps shrimp salad or a more
traditional cream cheese and cucumber

508
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:35,388
would be more appropriate?

509
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:37,067
Yum. Cucumber.

510
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:39,328
Is that peanut
butter and jelly?

511
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:41,536
Yes. I just thought since
the girls were only 10

512
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:44,231
that they'd enjoy it more than
the smoked-salmon sandwiches.

513
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:45,938
They're 10.
They're not animals.

514
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:49,362
This is a proper tea, Sookie.
I'm not interested in circus food.

515
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:50,829
Stings, don't it?

516
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,314
I'd like to see the room we'll be using.
If the lighting isn't right,

517
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,856
we may have to make
some adjustments.

518
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,600
Right this way.

519
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,691
I like your hair
like that, Lorelai.

520
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:06,699
It's a good sentence,
but you want to make sure

521
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:08,235
never to end with
a preposition.

522
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,520
If she ended the sentence
with a preposition,

523
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:11,111
how could it have
been a good sentence?

524
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:12,408
Sounds like a
terrible sentence.

525
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:13,594
- Oh, I just--
- You were just coddling her,

526
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:15,303
that's what you were just doing.
You want to prop her up on your knee

527
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:17,057
and burp her, too,
maybe buy her a pony?

528
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,666
I'm not paying you to make her feel
better about her incompetence.

529
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:21,248
If she can't construct
a proper sentence,

530
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:23,492
how is she gonna pass the
essay section of the S.A.T.?

531
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:24,521
- Well --
- That was rhetorical!

532
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,179
Why don't you go
slower, Dalton?

533
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:32,142
'Cause you haven't been on the same page
for the last 20 minutes or anything.

534
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:35,097
Okay, "doctor is
to hospital as,

535
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:36,802
"'A,' sports fan is to stadium,

536
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,195
'B,' ice is to freezer,

537
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,709
'C' professor is to college,

538
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,483
or, 'D,' criminal is to jail?"

539
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:43,956
Um, "A," sports
fan is to stadium?

540
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:46,633
It's actually "C,"
professor is to college.

541
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:47,882
When you're doing
this kind of analogy,

542
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:49,452
you have to be a
little more specific

543
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:51,582
than just filling in the
blank with "is found in."

544
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,061
A doctor works in a hospital,

545
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:55,331
just as a professor
works in a college.

546
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:56,360
Make sense?

547
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:57,308
You're really smart.

548
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,622
Thanks. That's
very sweet, Eric.

549
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,030
And you're just as smart.
I promise.

550
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:01,326
Are you kidding me with this?

551
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,322
That's it! Pencils down.
That means you, Casanova.

552
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,076
Time is up! Everyone out.

553
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,877
Unless your parents want to
start paying for overtime,

554
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,959
which for many of you
might be a good idea.

555
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:11,051
Not so fast, employees.

556
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,979
Today's work was
shoddy at best.

557
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,232
Between the overt coddling and
the inappropriate flirting,

558
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,919
I feel like I'm
running a bordello.

559
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,585
Gilmore, do you see any of my
students falling in love with me?

560
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,486
No. And you know why?
Because you don't fall in love

561
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:23,430
with people that make you
want to crap your pants.

562
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,063
I want to see terror
in their eyes!

563
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:28,045
Fear is a great motivator, people.
Use it.

564
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,887
What are you standing
around here for? Go!

565
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,364
Dismissed.

566
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:34,605
Okay, I'm not your
boss anymore.

567
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,948
We can do five minutes
of friend time.

568
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,298
I appreciate the offer,
but I have to make a phone call, so...

569
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:39,536
- Logan?
- Yep.

570
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:40,444
How's that going?

571
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,461
It's good, you know? It's fine.

572
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,986
- So, it's awful?
- No.

573
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,517
Because you downgraded from good
to fine in under two seconds,

574
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:47,677
so I figured I'd
cut to the chase.

575
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,677
Not awful.
It's just hard because of the distance.

576
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,451
Uh-huh. How's the sex?

577
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:55,328
Um, well,
seeing as he's in London and I'm here,

578
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,208
the sex is pretty
much nonexistent.

579
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,339
You've got a phone. Use it.

580
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:01,255
What? You mean...

581
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:02,838
I can't do that.

582
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:04,172
I talk to my mother
on that phone.

583
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:05,554
Okay, what about texting?

584
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:06,954
No. No, thank you.

585
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,766
Why not? You say stuff when
you're together, don't you?

586
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:10,041
Yeah. I guess. Sometimes.

587
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:12,140
So, text it. Texting is great.

588
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:13,828
And you can do it while
you're doing other things.

589
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:15,212
Doyle and I are
doing it right now.

590
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:16,523
What?

591
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:18,585
Oh, my god!

592
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,111
Don't worry. This is advanced.

593
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,297
Right now, all you're looking
to do is create some intimacy.

594
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:23,275
Stick to the basics.

595
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:24,569
I don't have any basics.

596
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:25,432
Write what you know.

597
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:27,037
Thanks, Paris.
I'll figure something out.

598
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,351
Doyle thinks it's a great idea.

599
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:29,788
Okay, can you not talk
about me on that thing

600
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:31,361
when you're doing
that with him?

601
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,243
Sorry.

602
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,615
Jeez.

603
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:39,684
I'm telling you, man,
she's totally avoiding me.

604
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:41,563
She won't even talk to me.
She'll barely look at me.

605
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:43,245
It's over. She's divorcing me.

606
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:44,855
I'll admit it,
it's not the best marriage I've seen,

607
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:46,333
although I only have my
parents to compare it to,

608
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:47,503
and they're unusually happy.

609
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:50,130
We were happy once,
and then that stupid honeymoon happened.

610
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:52,461
And ever since we came home,
it's like she's a different person.

611
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,245
- Maybe it was the parasite.
- What do you mean?

612
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:56,037
You know, maybe the parasite
like got into her brain

613
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,534
and ate away the part that
was in love with you.

614
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,088
I just can't believe it's over.

615
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:00,947
I mean, we haven't even written
our thank-you notes yet.

616
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:01,860
I was gonna say.

617
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:03,603
Hey man,
I already told you we like the bowl.

618
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:05,531
Doesn't mean I don't
deserve a note.

619
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,688
It's all gonna be okay, Zach.

620
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,517
I'm here for you, man.
I got your back.

621
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:13,809
Hey, that's nice.

622
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:16,243
Yeah, the pain is
totally helping my music.

623
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:19,292
We need to talk.

624
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:20,532
Okay.

625
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:22,188
Let's talk.

626
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:23,754
Alone?

627
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:27,598
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Brian.

628
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:29,747
I'm pregnant.

629
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:36,412
With a baby?

630
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:38,607
Yes, pregnant with a baby.

631
00:22:38,622 --> 00:22:40,269
But how? When?

632
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:42,770
On a beach in Mexico,
about three weeks ago.

633
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:43,914
I'm pretty sure you were there.

634
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,525
But we only did it once.

635
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:47,700
Once is really all it takes.

636
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,357
- Where are you going?
- Brian must be freaking out!

637
00:22:57,474 --> 00:22:59,100
Good afternoon, Lorelai.

638
00:22:59,114 --> 00:23:01,621
Oh, my goodness.

639
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:03,271
Is the library ready for us?

640
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:05,180
Yes, the tables are set,
and the tea is brewed,

641
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:06,560
and I've hired some
extra poor people

642
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,776
for the girls to look down on.

643
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,758
She's the one I told you about --
a regular Imogene Coca.

644
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:14,176
Oh, my god, I love them.

645
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,629
They are like madame
Alexander dolls come to life.

646
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:22,210
All right, ladies, chins up,
tummies in, and glide.

647
00:23:28,412 --> 00:23:30,554
Now, remember, ladies,
the dress you'll be wearing

648
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:33,952
at the cotillion on saturday
will have much fuller skirts.

649
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:36,166
Several of you may be
working with a crinoline,

650
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,564
so sitting will be an entirely
different experience.

651
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:40,940
What is the rule of thumb
we can always apply?

652
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:41,641
Tiffany?

653
00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:42,928
Bottoms out.

654
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,289
That's right.

655
00:23:44,302 --> 00:23:46,753
Bottoms, sit.

656
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:47,558
Very good.

657
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:50,070
Such elegance,
such a sense of decorum,

658
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:51,893
manners, grace, charm --

659
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:54,628
everything my childhood
could have been but wasn't.

660
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,854
Oh, to go back and do it right.

661
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:57,992
Hey, that's cool!

662
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:00,698
Caroline, we do not grab or
grope our dinner partners.

663
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:02,578
Sorry, Mrs. Gilmore.

664
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:05,926
Always maintain proper
spacing and distance.

665
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:08,265
It's all coming back to me.
Proper spacing and distance.

666
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,522
Other kids were
hugged and kissed.

667
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:11,948
I was taught to maintain
proper spacing and distance.

668
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,967
...in which case,
the utensil rule still applies.

669
00:24:14,981 --> 00:24:18,774
No utensil, once used,
may ever touch the table again.

670
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,529
Imagine leaving a ring
of raspberry preserves

671
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,303
on a set of fine linens.

672
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:24,952
Granted, these linens
aren't the best.

673
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:28,798
But at the cotillion on saturday,
everything will be of the highest quality.

674
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:32,711
All right, ladies,
choose your first sandwich.

675
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:35,167
- Take me.
- Oh, Michel!

676
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,449
Take me to the cotillion.
I have to be there.

677
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,714
I want to go back
and do it right.

678
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:40,278
- No, forget it.
- I insist.

679
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,803
You must take me.
You have no choice.

680
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:43,539
I have no choice?
Do you know me?

681
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:45,062
I'm not going to my
mother's cotillion.

682
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:46,309
You owe me.

683
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:48,813
- What? I do not.
- Oh, yes, you do.

684
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:50,741
Last november,
when you were going out of town

685
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,520
and nervous about boarding
Paul Anka for the first time,

686
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:55,844
you forced me,
against my better judgment,

687
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:57,970
to have Paul Anka over
to my home for the day

688
00:24:57,985 --> 00:24:59,871
so he could acclimate
to other dogs.

689
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:02,613
Well, not only did he
traumatize my poor chows,

690
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:05,279
but somehow he managed
to get into my closet,

691
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,609
the door of which
was firmly closed...

692
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:08,944
I know.
I don't know how he does that.

693
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,935
...and proceeded to poop
in my Prada loafers.

694
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:13,268
Well, he knows good quality.

695
00:25:13,284 --> 00:25:15,014
When I returned
your foul creature

696
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:16,521
and told you about
what happened,

697
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:19,685
you apologized profusely
and then wrote an I.O.U.

698
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:23,443
on several little post-its,
thinking it was all so clever.

699
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:25,488
Gosh, I don't remember that.

700
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:27,704
I thought as much.

701
00:25:27,718 --> 00:25:31,404
...on the seat of your chair. Do not
leave it carelessly strewn about the table.

702
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:32,995
Caroline?

703
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:35,586
Caroline!

704
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,183
"I"..."O"..."U"...

705
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:45,503
"one"..."big"..."favor."

706
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,391
Can't prove I wrote that.

707
00:25:47,405 --> 00:25:49,088
"Lorelai Gilmore."

708
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:50,566
- Ohh! I'll buy you a car.
- No.

709
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,062
- A house.
- Pick me up at 7:00.

710
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:52,647
Michel!

711
00:25:52,661 --> 00:25:55,199
And wear your hair like
you had it the other day.

712
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,189
Good nap, babe?

713
00:25:58,204 --> 00:25:59,743
Yeah, I was really out of it.

714
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,663
I'm so tired all the time.
It's weird.

715
00:26:01,678 --> 00:26:03,158
Huh. Must be the heat.

716
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:05,612
Yeah, right, I guess that could
have something to do with it.

717
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:06,437
Beer?

718
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:08,932
No, I don't think I'll be
drinking beer for a while.

719
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:11,791
Oh, that's cool.
Going a little straightedge.

720
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,406
But we probably should be
drinking more calcium,

721
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:17,293
so maybe I should keep an extra
gallon of milk around the house.

722
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,322
No problemo.

723
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,219
And I may start having
cravings soon --

724
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:22,339
Oh man!
You know what I'm craving right now?

725
00:26:22,353 --> 00:26:24,688
Pizza bagels. Those are definitely
going on the grocery list.

726
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:26,194
- Want some of those?
- Sure.

727
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,626
Do you like that, mountain ninja?
Do you like the taste of my broadsword?

728
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:31,336
Well, I'm off to see Rory.

729
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:33,081
Have fun.

730
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:44,283
Yikes. Oh, no.

731
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:45,750
- Whoa!
- That's disgusting.

732
00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:47,707
- Wow.
- No way! No way!

733
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,162
I can't write this
stuff to Logan.

734
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:51,063
I can barely read it to myself.
I'm bright red.

735
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,720
Did you notice no one
ever gives details

736
00:26:52,735 --> 00:26:54,140
when they tell you
about childbirth?

737
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:58,015
It's because the details are
gross and scary and unacceptable.

738
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:58,925
Like what?

739
00:26:58,939 --> 00:27:00,709
Well, apparently,
in about three months,

740
00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:03,454
I can look forward to
dark spots on my face

741
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,152
because it's not enough
to just get fat.

742
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:06,964
It's not fat. It's a baby.

743
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:08,707
A baby that will
shoot out of my body

744
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:11,078
despite the fact that it's
obviously much too large.

745
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,437
I didn't think this through
when we were dating.

746
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:14,569
I was all into the fact that
Zach was big and manly,

747
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,352
which means I'm gonna have a big,
manly baby,

748
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:17,264
and I'm a small woman.

749
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:19,029
I never thought of
Zach as big and manly.

750
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:20,263
Compared to Henry Lee?

751
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,875
Remember when my mom wanted
me to date Henry Lee?

752
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:22,940
He was like yea high.

753
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:24,898
I would have had tiny,
little, yea-high babies.

754
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,057
Yeah, but he was
your second cousin.

755
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:28,197
I think you would have had other
problems with those babies.

756
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:29,605
Whatever. I'm not doing it.

757
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:31,551
This baby is just gonna have
to find another way out

758
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:33,452
or stay in there forever.
I really don't care.

759
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:36,233
Don't worry about that part. Just keep
taking things one step at a time.

760
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:38,294
- You're doing great.
- How? How am I doing great?

761
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,473
You told Zach.
That was a very significant step.

762
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:42,783
Yeah, I told him,
but I'm pretty sure he forgot.

763
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,895
What do you mean he forgot?

764
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:46,993
I don't know how things get lost
in the recesses of Zach's brain,

765
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:47,913
but I think he forgot.

766
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:50,301
Well, maybe he's just taking
time to process all of this.

767
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:51,317
You needed some time.

768
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:53,764
I am growing a human
being inside my body.

769
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:56,124
I deserve time. Ugh!

770
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:58,626
Okay, what about this?

771
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:00,056
"Where is the chair you sit in?

772
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:02,483
Where is your favorite comb,
your toothbrush, your nail file?

773
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:05,031
Trot them out,
that I may devour them at one gulp."

774
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:06,153
You want to eat his toothbrush?

775
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:09,012
No, I'm trying to convey
that I miss him very much.

776
00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:10,767
Sounds like you miss
his toiletry kit.

777
00:28:10,783 --> 00:28:13,500
It's supposed to be
metaphorical and evocative.

778
00:28:13,514 --> 00:28:14,440
It's Henry Miller.

779
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:15,928
Henry Miller has better
stuff than that.

780
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:18,710
Believe me,
that is not why they banned his books.

781
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:20,051
Well, I'm not gonna write,

782
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,168
"Our hands groped frantically
for the burning flesh."

783
00:28:23,183 --> 00:28:24,128
Oh, that's better.

784
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:26,439
That's way hotter than
the eating-his-comb thing.

785
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,024
Oh really?

786
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,189
Why not? Go for it. Why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

787
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:30,592
I'm just worried, you know?

788
00:28:30,604 --> 00:28:32,980
I mean, we talk to each
other on the phone every day,

789
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:36,155
but I just don't think that that's
enough to keep this relationship going.

790
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:38,504
I guess I never realized how
important the other stuff was.

791
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:39,520
The sex stuff?

792
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:40,669
And the holding-hands

793
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,837
and the falling-asleep-
next-to-each-other stuff.

794
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:46,081
I mean, that's where the crazy intimacy
comes from, and without those options,

795
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:49,418
when they're just taken away from
you 'cause someone moves to London...

796
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:51,583
Desperate measures.

797
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:54,298
Burn that flesh, sister.

798
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,702
Okay.

799
00:28:57,716 --> 00:28:59,411
Here it goes.

800
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:02,987
I think I'm gonna puke.

801
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:05,316
Join me. That's all I'll be
doing for the next two months.

802
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,985
Oh, and did I mention
the extra hair

803
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:10,236
that may start to grow on my chin?
Can't wait for that magic.

804
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,962
Ooh, wow, quick response.
I think you did good.

805
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:13,814
It's not him.

806
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:14,696
Hi, dad.

807
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,240
Hey, kiddo. What are you up to?

808
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,946
Um, just reading. Reading the books.
What are you doing?

809
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,163
Just drinking the coffee,

810
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:21,342
thinking I haven't
seen you in a while.

811
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:22,668
I know. I miss you.

812
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:25,360
Me too. So, maybe we could have
dinner tomorrow night if you're free.

813
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:26,828
- Tomorrow night?
- Only if you're free.

814
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:28,612
I'm free.
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

815
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:29,533
- Yeah?
- Sure.

816
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,768
Great. That's great.
I'll pick you up about 7:00.

817
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:32,687
Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.

818
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:33,907
Bye, Rory.

819
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,978
Maybe I'll look
good with a beard.

820
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:43,089
Whoa! Can I keep this?

821
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:44,401
First, help me find
something to wear tonight.

822
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:45,843
Then you can steal whatever you want,
except that --

823
00:29:45,874 --> 00:29:47,012
I'm getting buried in that.

824
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:49,283
I just don't understand why
you're going to this cotillion.

825
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,028
Does Michel have compromising photographs
of you, that I don't know about,

826
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,869
like some snapshots
from your perm year?

827
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:56,380
No, but he does have post-its.

828
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,453
Word to the wise. Don't
ever put anything in writing,

829
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:01,406
'cause even when it's on florescent
sticky paper, it's still binding.

830
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:05,110
You are so wise and
awesome and generous.

831
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:06,690
Yeah, you can steal
anything you want

832
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,051
if you go to the
cotillion for me.

833
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:09,990
- Can't.
- Why? You don't have any work.

834
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:11,532
You don't have a
boyfriend to play with.

835
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:13,432
You barely have anyone
to hang out with at all.

836
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:15,572
Keep going. You're really making
me want to do you a favor here.

837
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,488
I can't tonight because
I have plans with dad.

838
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,618
Your dad?

839
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:22,026
I'm not in the habit of calling
other people's dads "dad."

840
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,514
Yeah, my dad.

841
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:26,140
He called and asked me if I
wanted to have dinner with him.

842
00:30:26,153 --> 00:30:27,043
Is that a problem?

843
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:29,708
No, of course not.
I just didn't realize you were talking.

844
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:31,106
I haven't talked to him at all,

845
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:32,296
which is why I was
happy he called,

846
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,204
because we were talking
all the time before.

847
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:35,213
Yeah, I know.

848
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:36,573
I mean,
just because you guys aren't talking,

849
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:38,386
it doesn't mean I'm not
allowed to talk to him, right?

850
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,470
We are not not talking.

851
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:42,692
We're just not
talking right now.

852
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:43,401
Okay.

853
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,782
Listen, I think it's great that
you're having dinner with your dad.

854
00:30:45,816 --> 00:30:47,307
- Good.
- Good.

855
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:48,438
What is with that thing?

856
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:50,098
I sent Logan a text
message yesterday,

857
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,766
and he still hasn't
written me back.

858
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,193
Plus, we missed our
last two phone calls

859
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,563
'cause he keeps getting dragged
into this boring meetings.

860
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:56,972
If he hasn't sent you anything back,
it's probably

861
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,547
'cause he just
hasn't had time yet.

862
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,935
Yeah, that's probably it.

863
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,931
Can I wear this
to the cotillion?

864
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:10,007
Something wrong with
your dinner, babe?

865
00:31:10,022 --> 00:31:11,098
If your bagel's
a little frozen,

866
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,604
I can microwave that
bad boy for you.

867
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:15,195
It's not that.
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

868
00:31:15,211 --> 00:31:18,128
Yeah, I've been
feeling queasy, too.

869
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:19,866
I'm telling you,
it's got to be the heat.

870
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,017
Do you want to go to
a movie or something?

871
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:22,666
Cool down with some free A.C.?

872
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,044
I have a better idea.
Why don't we talk?

873
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:27,837
Sure. What do you
want to talk about?

874
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,352
The baby.

875
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:34,473
I'm cool with the
whole baby thing.

876
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:35,682
- You are?
- Yeah.

877
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,157
So, you're not worried at all?

878
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:38,863
Nope, no worries on this end.

879
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,794
I see.

880
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:41,989
I think Brian might be
freaking out a little bit,

881
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:43,603
but that's his problem.

882
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:46,701
Really? I didn't know
Brian was concerned.

883
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:47,821
Well, sure.

884
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:50,451
I mean, he was just getting used
to the idea of us getting married,

885
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:52,866
and I don't think he was
expecting a baby yet.

886
00:31:52,882 --> 00:31:55,648
But it's a lot for
the guy to take in.

887
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:58,112
Absolutely. You know,
maybe I should talk to Brian about this

888
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:00,808
because it sounds like he
and I are on the same page.

889
00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:01,747
What do you mean?

890
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:03,472
Well, I'm glad you're fine
with the whole baby thing,

891
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,170
but I'm kind of freaking out.

892
00:32:05,186 --> 00:32:06,091
You are?

893
00:32:06,105 --> 00:32:08,756
Totally. Zach, this is not how
I expected our life to go --

894
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:12,776
be married for like a day and then suddenly
having to take on this new responsibility.

895
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:15,357
Bringing a child into this world,
it's so...

896
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,860
- It's major, right?
- It's very major.

897
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:20,111
So, you're not all psyched
about being knocked up?

898
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:21,895
Are you kidding?
This baby sucks!

899
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,861
Yeah! This baby totally sucks!

900
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:25,338
- It does.
- It so does.

901
00:32:25,352 --> 00:32:27,583
- Do you know what afterbirth is?
- No.

902
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:30,471
- Dude.
- I know.

903
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:32,877
You know how the baby is
connected to you by that hose

904
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:34,230
and I'm supposed
to cut that hose?

905
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:35,535
No way I'm cutting that hose.

906
00:32:35,548 --> 00:32:37,153
No way I'm letting
you in the room

907
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:38,096
when that thing
comes out of me.

908
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:40,107
Oh, man, you are so awesome.
I love you so much.

909
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:42,025
I love you, too.

910
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:45,295
It's like you don't even care.

911
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,868
I care about you,
just not this.

912
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:49,432
After all the trouble I went through
picking out the perfect flower for you.

913
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:51,357
It's kind of big, don't you think?
It's like wearing a tree on my arm.

914
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,074
- It is an orchid.
- It's scratchy.

915
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:55,241
Could have got me something,
a simple boutonniere. But no.

916
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,976
- I'm so humiliated.
- Hey, I have an idea.

917
00:32:56,992 --> 00:32:59,010
Why don't we go back to the flower
store, and I'll get you something?

918
00:32:59,045 --> 00:32:59,904
It'll take 2 seconds.

919
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:02,427
Forget it.
We're late enough as it is.

920
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:05,821
Yes, I can die now.

921
00:33:05,835 --> 00:33:06,875
Me too.

922
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:08,418
Look at that girl. Poor thing.

923
00:33:08,432 --> 00:33:11,238
Oh, why did someone force her
to wear those exercise shoes?

924
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,906
She'd probably rather be home,
in jeans, climbing a tree.

925
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,959
She looks perfectly
happy to me.

926
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,307
You know what I see when
I look at this room?

927
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:20,512
A bunch of kids whose outfits
cost more than my car?

928
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:24,376
No, these are not kids.
They are perfect, tiny adults.

929
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:27,648
We are standing amongst the next
generation of movers and shakers.

930
00:33:27,664 --> 00:33:29,635
The future president
of the united states

931
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:31,648
may be in this room
with us tonight.

932
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:33,249
You're very odd.

933
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:35,376
- Lorelai, you're here.
- I am.

934
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:36,885
Hello, Emily.

935
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:40,661
Oh, Emily, may I just say that
what you have created here tonight

936
00:33:40,677 --> 00:33:43,310
is nothing short of perfection?

937
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:47,194
This --
this is a kind of nirvana on earth.

938
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:50,310
Thank you, Michel.
It's very kind of you to say.

939
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:53,168
I'm sorry. What on earth
are those musicians playing?

940
00:33:53,184 --> 00:33:54,397
It sounds lovely.

941
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:56,868
Are those violinists on speed?

942
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,050
Excuse me.

943
00:33:58,065 --> 00:33:59,297
Hey, I'm gonna get some punch.
You want some?

944
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,365
Oh, no, thank you very much.
I'm much too excited for punch.

945
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:04,697
My throat closes off
when I'm excited,

946
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:07,525
so swallowing punch would be
very difficult right now.

947
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,743
Okay.

948
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:12,715
- Lorelai.
- Charlotte, hi.

949
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:14,850
I'm having the most
wonderful time.

950
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:16,760
Grandmother, grandfather,
it's my pleasure

951
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,543
to introduce you to
Lorelai Gilmore.

952
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,176
Lorelai, these are
my grandparents --

953
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:21,641
Beverly and Arthur Courtwright.

954
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:23,744
Ah, the famous Lorelai.

955
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:26,274
Famous? I have to catch
up on my us weeklies.

956
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:28,019
Charlotte told us
you were a card.

957
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:30,887
She also told us that you were
a delightful dining companion,

958
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,814
like Noel Coward and Slim
Keith rolled into one.

959
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,509
Oh, well,
she's delightful, too,

960
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:37,226
like Shirley Temple
and mother Teresa

961
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,659
and someone with very good
table manners rolled into one.

962
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:42,877
It's starting.
The dancing is starting.

963
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:44,266
We should get the camera.

964
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,278
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah.

965
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:47,794
Lorelai, did I tell you?

966
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,463
Margot, Caroline,
and I are doing a hip-hop dance,

967
00:34:50,475 --> 00:34:52,100
and it's gonna be so funny.

968
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:53,672
We rehearsed it
in the bathroom.

969
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,288
The whole thing ends up with us
somersaulting towards the band.

970
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,043
Wow! That's really great.

971
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,167
Are you gonna come dance?

972
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,450
Oh, no. It's just for the kids.

973
00:35:02,463 --> 00:35:04,375
Oh, come on.
Everybody is dancing.

974
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,841
Pardon me.
Would you like to dance, Charlotte?

975
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:08,846
I would be delighted, Toby.

976
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,077
People seem to be
enjoying themselves.

977
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:24,593
Yeah. They really do,
don't they?

978
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:26,032
Want to dance?

979
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,344
Me? No. Are you serious?

980
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,899
I never joke about dancing.

981
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:30,548
- No, I'll pass.
- You cannot pass.

982
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,900
This is still my night,
and I'd like to dance with you.

983
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:36,592
Besides, Charlotte insisted that
I get you out on the dance floor,

984
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:39,025
so that it's two against one --
you lose.

985
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,367
- Now, let's go.
- Oh!

986
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:42,900
Well...

987
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:56,922
I see you're having
a terrible time.

988
00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:58,265
The worst.

989
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:04,292
So, do you want the rest of this key
lime pie or should I take it with me?

990
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:05,665
I don't know how you
ordered key lime pie

991
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:07,227
when there was chocolate
brownie on the menu.

992
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,732
Because you'd already
ordered a chocolate brownie.

993
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,297
But just the one.

994
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,753
Maybe we should give
it to Paul Anka.

995
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,315
After all, the doggie bag was
invented with him in mind.

996
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,859
Seems only fair he
should benefit.

997
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,961
Ther's no way he's
gonna eat that.

998
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:20,749
- I told you.
- Hey.

999
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:21,872
Hi, mom.

1000
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:23,522
Hey, we were just
splitting up the food.

1001
00:36:23,537 --> 00:36:25,171
I'm... on my way out.

1002
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,149
Oh. Take your time.

1003
00:36:27,448 --> 00:36:29,997
Is that key lime
pie on the floor?

1004
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,366
Is that a corsage on your arm?

1005
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,267
Oh, this? Yeah.
Subtle, isn't it?

1006
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:36,611
If by "subtle," you mean "weird and
giant," then, yeah, super subtle.

1007
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:40,103
Okay, I think I'm gonna take
Paul Anka for his walk.

1008
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,196
Thanks for dinner, dad.

1009
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:42,751
Yeah, thanks, kiddo.

1010
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:44,142
Come on.

1011
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,547
Go on.

1012
00:36:47,712 --> 00:36:49,261
Oh, thanks.

1013
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:52,361
Did you guys have fun?

1014
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:53,711
It was good, really good.

1015
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:55,689
First time I ever saw
her order a drink.

1016
00:36:55,702 --> 00:36:56,809
Strange, right?

1017
00:36:56,824 --> 00:36:58,334
Very strange.

1018
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,702
Anyway, I should be going.

1019
00:37:01,716 --> 00:37:03,072
I'm sorry I didn't
call you back.

1020
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,498
- It's okay.
- I was going to. I just...

1021
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:07,657
I understand.
Don't worry about it.

1022
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,023
Do you want some
coffee or anything?

1023
00:37:11,036 --> 00:37:12,702
- Sure.
- Okay.

1024
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:22,407
Actually, you know what?
I can't.

1025
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,438
Oh. Okay.

1026
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,104
I can't just sit here
and have coffee with you.

1027
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:29,381
Okay.

1028
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,056
I love you.

1029
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:34,222
I know the other night didn't
mean for you what it did for me,

1030
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:37,111
but I don't regret it and I haven't stopped
thinking about it since it happened --

1031
00:37:37,144 --> 00:37:39,766
not just because it was great,

1032
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,588
which it was...

1033
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,523
but because it was right.
It was so right, Lore,

1034
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:46,374
and you may not see that right now,
but I do.

1035
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,194
And if I have to wait until
we're both 80 years old

1036
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:51,553
for you to see it,
then I'll wait.

1037
00:37:51,692 --> 00:37:53,922
I'm not going anywhere.
This is it for me.

1038
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:56,241
You're it for me.

1039
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:58,735
And I can't pretend to
feel any less than I do.

1040
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:00,759
I'm sorry. I-I --

1041
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:03,244
I just can't.

1042
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:27,431
Ace.

1043
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:29,279
Hey, how's it going?

1044
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,934
It's 4:45 in the morning.
Are you okay? Did something happen?

1045
00:38:32,948 --> 00:38:36,396
Not really. Um, I just --

1046
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,727
I sent you a text
the other day.

1047
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:41,776
Yeah, I know.
I texted you back.

1048
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:42,689
No, you didn't.

1049
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:44,204
Yes, I did. Check your phone.

1050
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:45,738
I don't have any missed calls.

1051
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:48,741
Oh, wait, there's a little envelope
thingy in the bottom corner.

1052
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:49,794
Get out of town.

1053
00:38:49,808 --> 00:38:52,317
It went directly to my saved messages.
Why would it do that?

1054
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:55,167
- I couldn't tell you.
- Ooh, wow.

1055
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:57,573
Whoa, yours is really good.

1056
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:59,856
Okay, well, sorry to wake you.

1057
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:01,321
I'll talk to you
in a few hours.

1058
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:03,069
Whoa, wait a minute.
Where do you think you're going?

1059
00:39:03,102 --> 00:39:04,353
Um, to sleep?

1060
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:06,443
No, I don't think so.
You woke me up.

1061
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:07,662
I'm up. Text me back.

1062
00:39:07,676 --> 00:39:09,300
You want me to
text you back now?

1063
00:39:09,316 --> 00:39:10,588
You started this.

1064
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:13,510
I know,
but I don't have my books with me.

1065
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:14,989
You don't need your books, Ace.

1066
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:17,404
- Logan --
- I miss you, Rory.

1067
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:19,171
- You do?
- Yeah.

1068
00:39:19,186 --> 00:39:20,789
I miss you, too.

1069
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:22,871
I can't text you with
you on the phone.

1070
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:24,060
Okay, so hang up.

1071
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:26,131
- I'm gonna hang up now.
- Okay.

1072
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:29,317
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

1073
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,801
Hi, Chris.
