1
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:06,472
Luke, hello?

2
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:08,485
Luke!

3
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:10,158
My door is chained!

4
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:12,743
Especially funny,
since I don't have a chain on my door.

5
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:14,296
- Luke!
- Lorelai?

6
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:15,446
No.

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,441
Land shark.

8
00:00:16,513 --> 00:00:17,553
Candygram.

9
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:18,983
Here's Johnny.

10
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,159
Luke, open the door!

11
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:22,041
Stay there.

12
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:23,597
Oh, oh, okay.

13
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:25,245
God.

14
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:29,021
Ow. Ow, I have a cramp. Luke, I have a cramp.

15
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:30,066
Sorry.

16
00:00:30,772 --> 00:00:32,229
I'm permanently stuck like this.

17
00:00:32,307 --> 00:00:34,401
Get your arm out of the way
so I can unchain the door.

18
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:36,751
Sure. Just yell "stand up!"
to the guy in the wheelchair.

19
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:38,836
I chained it earlier to test the door. Here.

20
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:41,148
Oh, what an odd reward system you have.

21
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,345
Come with me.

22
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:43,493
What's going on?

23
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,781
We... are celebrating.

24
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:47,065
Celebrating what?

25
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,172
Listen.

26
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:50,512
Are you cooking?

27
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:51,353
Is that listening?

28
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:52,118
Well, I'm hungry.

29
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:53,245
Focus.

30
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:54,919
- I'm hungry.
- Shh.

31
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:55,930
Fine.

32
00:00:58,527 --> 00:00:59,602
I don't hear anything.

33
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:00,881
Exactly.

34
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:02,773
Okay, Simon, Garfunkel.

35
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:03,725
It's done.

36
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:05,780
- What's done?
- The house. It's done.

37
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:07,055
No, it was supposed to take another week.

38
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:10,605
I know. I paid Tom a bonus to get
the guys out of here early.

39
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:12,767
And he finished everything?

40
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:16,732
Yep! No more banging or sawing,
no more paint cans lying around,

41
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,087
cigarette butts in the potted plants.

42
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,113
Well, they didn't put the light-socket
covers back on.

43
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:22,681
They'll have to come back to
put the light-socket c--

44
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:24,479
Light-socket covers are on.

45
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,197
What about the skinny, tiny,
molding in the closet?

46
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,923
They have to fix the skinny,
tiny molding in the closet.

47
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:29,688
Skinny, tiny molding is done.

48
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,741
Well, I'm sure they did not
pick up all their tools.

49
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:34,339
They'll have to come back
and pick up their tools.

50
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:35,693
You're not happy they're gone.

51
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:38,411
No, I am. I just wanted to say "goodbye."

52
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:39,092
Goodbye?

53
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:42,380
I wanted to have a "we're done" party,
buy them some pizza.

54
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:43,928
More pizza.

55
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:45,936
And I had going-away presents for them.

56
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:49,150
I gave them a present-- a $2,000
going-away present.

57
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:50,663
That's got to bring some smiles.

58
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:52,304
But I bought paper hats and noisemakers.

59
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:55,398
The place was covered with dust.
You were woken up at 6:00 a.m.

60
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,730
every morning by the hammering.
I thought you'd be happy.

61
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,225
I am. I'm just sad at the same time.

62
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:01,397
You've never been with a woman before?

63
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:03,250
Okay, fine.

64
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,486
I've got another surprise for you.

65
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:06,626
- What?
- Upstairs.

66
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:07,779
- Where?
- Bedroom.

67
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:10,774
Upstairs in the bedroom?
Whatever could it be?

68
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,259
Close your eyes.

69
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:17,811
I'm not scared of it anymore.

70
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:19,602
Would you please just close your eyes?

71
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:20,530
Okay.

72
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,691
You ready?

73
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:29,739
Ready.

74
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:31,582
Take a look.

75
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:35,891
Wow! What is this?

76
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:40,550
This is my grandmother's bedroom set.

77
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:43,142
It's in perfect shape. Can you imagine?

78
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,715
Wow!

79
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:46,658
Look at all the cherubs.

80
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:48,870
People have been trying to
buy it off me for years,

81
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:54,116
but I always felt that I would eventually
find the perfect place to put it, you know?

82
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:57,142
And then the room was done
and just sitting there,

83
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,926
and I remembered the day you came
down to that storage unit,

84
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:02,159
and you saw the furniture,
and you said you liked it.

85
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:02,979
I did?

86
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:06,541
Yeah. And since I've been looking for
a place to put it, I figured--

87
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:08,202
When did I come to your storage unit?

88
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,337
Five years ago.
You needed to borrow that space heater.

89
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,243
Oh, right.

90
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,690
And look-- I haven't had a chance to
put these up. Aren't they great?

91
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:16,056
Yes. Yes, they are.

92
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,933
I was tempted to get them reframed,
but it just didn't seem right.

93
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:23,721
Oh. I've got one big eye. That's fun.

94
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,092
That's the original glass.
You can't find that anymore.

95
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:29,707
So, you sure you like it?

96
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:31,950
- I love it.
- Great. Okay.

97
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:36,165
Well, let's get downstairs,
'cause I am making risotto.

98
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:40,224
I just love it.

99
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:55,560
Sumatra, please get my granddaughter a plate.

100
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:58,229
That's all right, Sumatra.
I'm just going up to my room.

101
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:02,358
Sumatra, please tell my granddaughter
that all food is to be
consumed in the dining room.

102
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,291
Sumatra, please tell my grandmother-- what?

103
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:05,900
That's the rule in this house, Rory.

104
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:07,453
I'm late for community service.

105
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:10,877
Food is meant to be consumed in
the dining room or not at all.

106
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:13,029
What about when you take your
tea outside on the patio?

107
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:14,431
That is in the afternoon.

108
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:17,778
This is the morning, and in the morning you
eat at the table in the dining room.

109
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,873
Fine. I'll be back this afternoon.

110
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:26,689
If you expect that muffin to fly back to the
kitchen, you'd better go get it a cape.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,779
Hey.

112
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,378
- I have to go to China.
- Enjoy your flight.

113
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,683
I need inspiration. I need ideas.

114
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,223
I'm tapped-out, boring.

115
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:41,574
You know what's on the menu tonight?

116
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:42,051
What?

117
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,894
Goose with oyster stuffing.

118
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:44,866
What?

119
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:47,167
I know. But that's all I could come up with.

120
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:50,670
And the only reason I thought of that was
because Davey just learned "duck duck goose,"

121
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:53,042
and the ducks looked puny, so there you go.

122
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:54,843
Say hi to Yao Ming for me.

123
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:56,106
Will do. What is this?

124
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:58,173
This is a formal invitation, written by me

125
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:00,340
on the Dragonfly notepad
about five minutes ago,

126
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,424
inviting you and Jackson to a housewarming
dinner at my newly completed pad.

127
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:05,891
- It's done.
- It's done.

128
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,144
Saturday night.

129
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:10,103
I've heard it's all right for fighting.
Get a little action in.

130
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:14,234
Wow. Your house is done. This is so exciting!
How does it look?

131
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:16,005
It, uh, looks great.

132
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:18,062
- It, uh, does?
- Yeah.

133
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:18,941
Why do you hate it?

134
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:20,748
I don't hate it. It's beautiful.

135
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:25,839
It's just-- what if Jackson brought home a
set of his grandmother's pots and pans?

136
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:28,810
Now, obviously, you need some pots and pans,
and these are free and all,

137
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,478
but they're really old.

138
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:34,000
You don't want to hurt Jackson's
feelings 'cause he feels very
sentimental about the pans,

139
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:37,285
but they've got fat cherubs carved all over
them, and you just don't want them.

140
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:40,516
Do the cherubs interfere with the cooking
function, or are they just decorative?

141
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:44,089
Decorative is a wildly generous description,
but function's fine.

142
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,426
What happened to my old pots and pans?

143
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,584
Gone. Thrown out.

144
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:47,683
Can I get them back?

145
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:49,421
Babette's nephew, Gary, is sleeping on them.

146
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:50,330
Sleeping on them?

147
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:51,902
We're not talking about pans, Sookie.

148
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,006
What are you talking about?

149
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:55,581
I'm talking about Luke's grandmother's
bedroom furniture

150
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:57,480
that he set up in my brand-new bedroom.

151
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:59,360
And he loves this furniture.

152
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:00,181
And you don't?

153
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:02,080
No, I don't, but it shouldn't matter, right?

154
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:02,590
Why not?

155
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,006
Look at everything Luke has done for me.

156
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,053
He bought the Twickham house and then
un-bought the Twickham house,

157
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,834
and then he almost bought it again,
and then he decided to live at my house

158
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,363
because I wanted to live at my house.

159
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,550
Yeah, he did.

160
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,874
He has turned his whole life
upside down for me.

161
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,212
He does everything in his power to make
me happy and give me what I want,

162
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:19,216
so can't I give him this one thing?

163
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:20,212
Yes, you can.

164
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,424
No, I can't.

165
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,299
The bed is small and really low--

166
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:26,698
just perfect for tiny, shrunken limbs
that can't be too far off the ground.

167
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:29,770
And then he has this ancient dresser with
the original fun-house mirror in it

168
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:33,310
so that when I wake up every morning-- and
I am at my most visually vulnerable--

169
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:36,019
I'll look in there and think
I'm that kid from "Mask."

170
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,725
You can replace the mirror.

171
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,804
No. He loves the mirror and
the bed and the dresser--

172
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,493
oh, and the paintings,
did I tell you about the paintings?

173
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:42,686
- No.
- Of sailboats?

174
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:47,921
There's six of them. Six sailboats waiting
to sail me away to an old-folks home,

175
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:50,724
then, when the wind's right,
drop me off at the pearly gates.

176
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:52,189
I'm hateful and selfish.

177
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:53,078
No, you're not.

178
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:54,795
I just want my new house to be perfect.

179
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:56,859
Half that crap in there was hand-me-downs
to begin with.

180
00:07:56,933 --> 00:08:00,120
I had that old bed that Mia let me
snag from the Independence Inn.

181
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,597
I just wanted something new.

182
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,136
- You have to tell him.
- I can't tell him.

183
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:04,050
Maybe it's not so bad.

184
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:06,508
Well, you'll see for yourself
on Saturday night. 7:30?

185
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:07,868
Aye, aye, captain.

186
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:13,389
Emily, sorry to be so late.

187
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,770
Benson wouldn't stop talking.

188
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:20,051
The car will be here in 20 minutes
to take me to the airport.

189
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:23,195
Remember, I'm not going to
be back until Tuesday,

190
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:26,968
so you're going to have to deal
with Alijandro yourself.

191
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,856
I will leave you the check.

192
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,422
All you have to do is hand it to him and
tell him that if there are any problems

193
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:36,624
I will be back to talk to him on Wednesday.

194
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:39,266
I hope you told the maid to pack my raincoat.

195
00:08:39,357 --> 00:08:42,279
Forecasts are predicting
armageddon, apparently.

196
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,088
Now, I have a stopover in Las Vegas.

197
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:48,304
Is there anything that you
want me to bring you back?

198
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,950
Your safe return, darling, is all I need.

199
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,558
Who the hell are you?

200
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:55,105
If I knew that, I could dismiss my therapist,
couldn't I?

201
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,595
Though she's very hot.

202
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:57,523
I'm Colin McCrea.

203
00:08:57,592 --> 00:08:58,489
How wonderful for you.

204
00:08:58,563 --> 00:08:59,822
What are you doing in my house?

205
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:02,661
Put that box down.
Both of you. Explain yourselves.

206
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:05,478
Mr. Gilmore, I'm Colin McCrea.
You know my father, Andrew McCrea.

207
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,257
Yes, I know Andrew McCrea.
What are you doing in my house?

208
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,261
Where's Mrs. Gilmore?

209
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:10,612
Don't know, mate. Rory let us in.

210
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,014
We came over to help her move her stuff.

211
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:13,180
Where?

212
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:14,653
To her new place of residence.

213
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:16,553
What do you mean?

214
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:17,482
Rory's moving out?

215
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,733
I hope so. Otherwise, she'll have
nothing to wear tomorrow.

216
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:22,878
That's preposterous! A person doesn't
just move out without a word.

217
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,239
Where is she? Rory!

218
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:25,479
She already left.

219
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:26,735
I want an explanation.

220
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,707
We'll have her call you.

221
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:30,601
You're-- What are you doing with that?
That's my tennis racket.

222
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:32,943
I told you she didn't point
to the closet on the right.

223
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:34,877
Then I have no idea what closet
she was pointing to.

224
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:37,005
I suppose these humidors aren't hers, either.

225
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,113
Pity.

226
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,402
Any chance you're sick of them?

227
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,923
I promise to give them a nice home

228
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,498
and show them a picture of you
every year at Christmas.

229
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:47,842
Very tall man, that one.

230
00:09:58,305 --> 00:09:59,257
They're going to get cold.

231
00:09:59,339 --> 00:09:59,938
Are they different?

232
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:01,450
- Different than what?
- They seem different.

233
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,000
They're nachos. Now eat them.

234
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:04,741
You used baked chips.

235
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:05,600
What?

236
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:08,524
You did, didn't you?
You used baked chips and low-fat cheese.

237
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:11,541
I did not use low-fat cheese.

238
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:13,392
- How can you tell?
- How could you lie?

239
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:14,624
They taste the same!

240
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:16,067
Oh, the trust, Luke.

241
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,481
How are we going to make it if you're
trying to keep me healthy?

242
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,687
Fine. Forget it. Die at 60.

243
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:22,388
Bring me a donut while I wait.

244
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,029
Hey, Lane. Yoo-hoo! Lane!

245
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:28,717
Whoo! Lane, seriously.

246
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:30,328
I'm landing planes over here.

247
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:33,056
Lorelai. Hey.

248
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:34,559
Hey. Fill me up here.

249
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:37,506
So, how's it going?

250
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:38,365
Good.

251
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:40,282
Good.
I haven't seen you the last couple days.

252
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,908
I've been working the lunch shift.

253
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,008
Oh.

254
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,890
Something wrong?

255
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,582
Wrong?

256
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:49,806
Yeah, you're giving me a Valerie Cherish.
"I don't wanna see that!"

257
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,312
It's a great show. You should watch it.

258
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:53,330
- I will.
- It's canceled.

259
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,550
- Oh, sorry.
- Well, it's not your fault, so...

260
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,728
Wow, what's going on here?

261
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:01,756
Usually when I come in, you say hi, I say hi,

262
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:04,760
and you tell me what's going on in your life,
and I tell you what's going on in my life.

263
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:08,282
It's not curing the bird flu or anything,
but it's been a nice tradition.

264
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:10,469
Rory moved in with me.

265
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:13,619
She... but why? What happened?

266
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:15,906
I don't know.
We haven't had the in-depth conversation yet.

267
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:19,635
She just said she moved out of
her grandparents' house and
needed a place to crash.

268
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:20,753
Wow, that's pretty big.

269
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:21,578
Yeah.

270
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,022
And she didn't tell me if I could
say anything to you, so
I just assumed I shouldn't.

271
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,575
Right, I get it. I heard nothing.

272
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,162
So, it's nice of you to let her crash.

273
00:11:30,244 --> 00:11:32,333
She's small.
How much room can she take up, right?

274
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:33,232
Did she bring her books?

275
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,328
Good point.

276
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,400
Are you okay?

277
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:38,062
Me? Sure. I'm fine.

278
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:39,560
A little curious, but I'm fine.

279
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,248
- Well, when I know more...
- Right.

280
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,442
- Okay.
- Okay.

281
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,508
- Okay.
- Okay.

282
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:55,334
Lunch is served.

283
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,416
Such service.

284
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,485
I'm just in it for the tips.

285
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:58,899
Underwear first, then pants.

286
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:01,048
What a shame I'm away from my snare drum.

287
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,787
- Want a soda?
- Please. Soda me.

288
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,135
Shampoo's looking low.

289
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:05,361
I'll get more tomorrow.

290
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:08,623
Four people in the house sure makes
the shampoo go away faster.

291
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:10,066
I brought my own shampoo, Zach.

292
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,716
Hey, not a judgment, just an observation.

293
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,728
Two paper towels, huh?

294
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,113
Relax, Zach.

295
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:17,729
Hey, it's cool.

296
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:20,328
Paper towels don't grow on trees.
They cost money.

297
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:22,677
Use two a day for a month,
that's like 60 paper towels.

298
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,257
You're looking at 24 rolls per year.

299
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,666
I'm not staying that long, Zach.

300
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:28,900
Hey, Lane's casa es su casa, apparently.

301
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,714
Oh, cool! Don't have to strain
myself by lifting a full box.

302
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,326
Excellent.

303
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,889
I'm not staying that long, Zach.

304
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,392
She's not staying that long, Zach.

305
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:37,573
A couple of days, tops.

306
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:39,145
Yeah? Remember Don?

307
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:42,895
He came for a couple days, tops, once.
Six weeks later, he's still here.

308
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,885
Ate all my cheese nips,
but when I confronted him with the box,

309
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,138
he said they were just settling.

310
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,899
Dude had cheese-nip breath as he
told me they were just settling.

311
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:52,891
Oh, my God, Zach, I am not staying that long.

312
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:53,786
Hello.

313
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,342
Rory Gilmore, please.

314
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,562
This is Rory Gilmore.

315
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:59,647
Rory, this is Stuart Woltz of
the Stamford Eagle Gazette.

316
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:03,487
Mr. Woltz, yes.
Thank you so much for calling me back.

317
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:05,415
No problem. I got your message.

318
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:08,516
I'll be happy to give you a reference.
I'll even make it a great one.

319
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:09,280
Really?

320
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:12,670
Look, I don't really know what happened with
you and Mitchum, but from me to you,

321
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,115
you're a sharp kid,
and you got a lot going for you.

322
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,057
Anybody would be lucky to have
you working for them.

323
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:18,126
Thank you so much.

324
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:20,046
I know this'll shock you,
but you're not the first person

325
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,931
who couldn't get along with Herr Huntzberger.

326
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,083
It's a pretty big club, actually. Ignore him.

327
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:25,395
I plan on doing just that.

328
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:29,553
Good. Okay, so,
just have whoever you want call me,
and I'll sing your praises.

329
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:31,112
Sorry I can't hire you at the gazette,

330
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:33,309
but we don't have any openings
right now anyhow, so...

331
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,590
That's okay. The reference will be plenty.

332
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,774
Good luck, Rory.

333
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:38,714
I expect to hear great things
about you someday.

334
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:41,648
I promise not to let you down.
Goodbye, Mr. Woltz.

335
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:43,138
Yes!

336
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:44,392
Good news?

337
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:46,096
References are now officially in order,

338
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:50,192
which is a relief because I've already
sent out 125,000 resumés.

339
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:54,600
Oh, listen-- I forgot to tell you.
I may have done something stupid.

340
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:55,375
What?

341
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:58,569
Well, I kind of told Lorelai
that you moved in here.

342
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:00,326
I'm sorry? "Moved in here"?

343
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,252
Zach, there must be something
else you can do.

344
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:03,321
When did you see my mom?

345
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:05,559
This morning at Luke's. I'm sorry.

346
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:09,049
I didn't know what to say, if you wanted
her to know or didn't want her to know.

347
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,616
It's fine that she knows.

348
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,708
Oh, good.

349
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:13,595
It's time to get dressed
and hit the pavement.

350
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:14,389
Wait.

351
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:15,378
Your sandwich.

352
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,349
Thank you.

353
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:20,616
Sure, just leave your computer plugged in,
sucking up all our energy.

354
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:21,516
Zach.

355
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:23,785
What? I'm just writing a song.

356
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,545
I can't believe you didn't do
anything to the kitchen.

357
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:30,432
What are you talking about?
Look at the brand-new napkin holder.

358
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:32,673
It used to be a cow.
Now it's a much bigger cow.

359
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,076
Fine. Forget it.

360
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,566
Chicken and dumplings going in.

361
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,157
You do know the pile of burgers
sitting in the refrigerator

362
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:39,804
is intended for human consumption.

363
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,480
I never go anywhere without a casserole.

364
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:43,332
Must make dining out rather awkward.

365
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:46,040
Look, if by some chance Luke
happens to burn the chicken

366
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,251
or overcook the burgers,
then we won't starve.

367
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,925
If everything turns out perfect,
then you can freeze the casserole

368
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,791
and eat it for the rest of your life.

369
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:55,079
- Perfect plan.
- Forget it.

370
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,372
There is no shame in using
a charcoal chimney.

371
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,128
It's a gadget. I don't do gadgets.

372
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:00,433
It takes twice as long.

373
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:01,692
You got someplace to be?

374
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,314
No, you just go right ahead and
rub those sticks together.

375
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:05,916
I'll just go learn a language or something.

376
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:07,124
Bernardo. Riff.

377
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,311
And a real man doesn't use
a charcoal chimney.

378
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:11,028
Oh, so now I'm not a real man?

379
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:12,986
He is too. I have pictures to prove it.

380
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:13,989
Do you have a spray bottle?

381
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,755
For what?

382
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:17,118
To spray the flames down
if they get too high.

383
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:18,384
Or do you just use a hose?

384
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:20,453
No, he blows them out with his man-breath.

385
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:22,634
And then he challenges them to
an arm-wrestling contest.

386
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:25,643
And then he insults the flame's mother
and sleeps with its girlfriend.

387
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,612
And the next time you come back,
you better be carrying food!

388
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:32,438
Okay, boys are busy.
The chicken's in the oven.

389
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,282
- Show me the bedroom set.
- Sookie.

390
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:35,959
I want to see the creepy granny bed.

391
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,497
Oh, I'm trying to rise above it.

392
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:39,134
Rise above it later. Let's go.

393
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,612
Here it is.

394
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:44,382
Huh.

395
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:45,672
It's terrible, right?

396
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,973
- Well, it's...
- Terrible?

397
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,507
- ...Really terrible.
- I told you.

398
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:52,637
Ow. Oh, my god.

399
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:55,414
You can't sleep in this.

400
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,306
Don't worry,
I won't-- I'm convinced it's haunted,

401
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:58,742
and one night Luke will come
back from the bathroom

402
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:01,388
and find nothing but a bloody hook
hanging from the cherubs.

403
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:03,512
Oh, my god. I just saw the cherubs.

404
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:07,177
Okay, let's think-- maybe
if you stripped the wood.

405
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:08,428
And lit a match?

406
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,452
Throw on a little gasoline.

407
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:11,420
I can't tell him I hate it.

408
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,335
Yeah, you have to. It's horrible.

409
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:15,440
Yes, but Luke loves this furniture.

410
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:17,394
Right. Luke loves this furniture.

411
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,055
Luke loves this furniture.

412
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,649
Luke loves this furniture?

413
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:21,223
Yes.

414
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,569
Has he seen it?

415
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:24,436
Has he seen this?

416
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:27,454
And that-- has he seen that?

417
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:29,016
Come on.

418
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:33,880
Oh, now, I know he hasn't seen that.

419
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:38,493
I'm going to check on the chicken.

420
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:41,397
Hey, Lore-- haven't said that in a while.

421
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,460
- Is that--
- Anyway, hope you're good.

422
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:47,266
Hope Rory is good.
I wanted to talk to you-- nothing terrifying.

423
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:50,836
I think I have good news. In fact,
I know I have good news.

424
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:53,214
Anyhow I'm hoping you'll call me back and--

425
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:55,409
Hey. How's the food coming? I'm starving.

426
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:56,356
Who was that?

427
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,938
It sounded like Christopher.

428
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,057
Bye-bye.

429
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,154
If you knew who it was, why'd you ask?

430
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:04,547
Were you going to tell me he called?

431
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,250
Luke, yes.

432
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:07,574
Then why'd you turn the machine
off when I walked in?

433
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:10,295
- It was a reflex.
- Reflex?

434
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:13,432
Yeah, I panicked. I didn't think.
I looked up, and you were standing there.

435
00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:14,866
How long has this been going on?

436
00:17:14,948 --> 00:17:15,368
What?

437
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:17,335
You talking to Christopher.
It's just talking, right?

438
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:22,155
Yes-- no, no. No talking, no anything.
There's nothing going on.

439
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:22,901
Fine.

440
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:24,156
Are you leaving?

441
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,598
Burgers are done.

442
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:26,699
Let's talk about this.

443
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:28,705
I don't want to argue in front of guests.

444
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:32,310
Last time we were over,
Sookie breast-fed Martha during appetizers.
We owe them.

445
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:35,422
I won't discuss this with people
in the house. It's rude.

446
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:39,057
No, it's rude to silently sulk through dinner
and make them feel uncomfortable

447
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,487
because they know we're fighting and
we're pretending we're not fighting.

448
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:44,208
We're not fighting... yet.

449
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,018
So, we're standing in a giant pile of manure,
and I am screaming,

450
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,756
"I asked for extra fish heads!"

451
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:58,443
And he's like, "no,
you did not ask for extra fish heads."

452
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:01,061
Oh, I tell you-- it was hilarious!

453
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:04,526
And of course all the celery
guys are staring,

454
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:06,901
and then "tomato" George-- we
call him "tomato" George.

455
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:10,292
He's got a loy of extra time on his hands
right now 'cause tomatoes are out of season.

456
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:12,515
Anyhow, he steps in and says,

457
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:16,128
"I don't want to hear another
thing about the fish heads."

458
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,399
He's from Kansas.

459
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:21,033
The burgers are delicious, Luke.

460
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,483
Oh, yeah, I like them burnt.

461
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,085
You can't get anyone to really
burn a burger anymore.

462
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:26,951
The chicken and dumplings are good, too.

463
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,021
What?

464
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:32,047
Nice snort.

465
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:33,017
I didn't snort.

466
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:34,880
People in Kansas talk funny.

467
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,157
Did I miss something?

468
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,075
Always, honey.

469
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,187
It's nothing, Jackson.

470
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,929
Oh. I bet I know what's going on.

471
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:45,373
Nothing's going on, Jackson.

472
00:18:45,463 --> 00:18:46,517
Oh, yes, it is.

473
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,877
It is not lost on me that the burgers with
my world-famous rub are almost gone,

474
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:54,087
while your butter burgers are still
sitting there on the plate.

475
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:55,330
You a little humbled now, my friend?

476
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,019
Jackson.

477
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:59,182
My burgers are better-- admit it!
I demand satisfaction.

478
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,242
Sorry.
He's just so excited to be around grown-ups.

479
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:02,838
Hey.

480
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,291
No, it's fine.
He's right-- his burgers are better.

481
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:06,371
Thank you.

482
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:08,411
I crown thee burger king.

483
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:09,788
I can admit it.

484
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,697
I have no trouble telling someone something

485
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:14,582
no matter how uncomfortable
it might make them.

486
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:18,057
Wow. They'll be debating the subtle
complexities of that comment for years.

487
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,645
Okay, I did miss something.

488
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,483
- Lorelai and Luke are fighting.
- We're not fighting.

489
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:22,876
No, we don't fight in front of company.

490
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:24,380
- It's rude.
- We wouldn't want to be rude.

491
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:25,538
It's fine. Just eat.

492
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,245
What's that?

493
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,162
Chicken and dumplings?

494
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:28,414
Who the hell made chicken and dumplings?

495
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,406
Sookie, our guest,
who we don't want to be rude to.

496
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:31,728
I'm not the one who started this.

497
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:34,108
I'm sorry. Are we talking about this now?

498
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:37,003
- You knew how I'd feel.
- You have no reason to be upset.

499
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,487
- I don't? You were hiding--
- I wasn't hiding anything.

500
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:42,970
- You hung up the phone just as I
came-- - Didn't let me explain.
I was about to tell you.

501
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:45,831
At that moment,
it was not appropriate to talk about it--

502
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:48,364
So you'd rather just sit and stew
and be mad for no reason?

503
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,795
So, it was just a weird coincidence
that I walk in

504
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:52,808
and Christopher happens to
be leaving a message,

505
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:56,409
and it happens to be the first time you've
had contact with him in a month?

506
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:59,864
In a year, Luke! The last time I saw
him was the last time you saw him!

507
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:01,260
Well, I don't believe in coincidences.

508
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:02,410
This is not fair!

509
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,203
I have a right to expect a little
honesty from my fiancé!

510
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:07,014
You want honesty? I'll give you honesty.

511
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,286
I hate that bedroom set.
It's old and creepy, and I hate it.

512
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,263
You told me you loved it.

513
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:15,238
I have absolutely no memory of coming
to your storage unit five years ago

514
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:17,119
and telling you I love that furniture.

515
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:20,359
Thank you very much for your honesty
about my grandmother's furniture.

516
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:22,754
Too bad you're not more forthcoming
about the other men in your life.

517
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:27,020
Oh, my god. Enjoy Wisteria Lane,
you major drama queen.

518
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:28,099
I'm done.

519
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:32,365
Wrap yourself in a towel and trip
over a hedge on your way out!

520
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:35,568
Are you okay?

521
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:36,929
I'm fine.

522
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,230
I'm sorry, you guys.

523
00:20:39,386 --> 00:20:41,708
Give Paul Anka the burger.

524
00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:45,887
Was it because I brought up my meat rub?

525
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:47,948
Yes, it was.

526
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,517
Come in.

527
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:00,279
Okay, see...

528
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:06,668
Once we're married, you're not going to be
able to run away to your clubhouse anymore.

529
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:10,532
You're going to have to join a rotisserie
baseball league with the rest of the men.

530
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:12,444
When we're married, huh?

531
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,339
Gee, when's that going to be?

532
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,419
I brought you something to eat.

533
00:21:17,516 --> 00:21:20,702
You're going to need sustenance if we're
going to go another 10 rounds.

534
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,704
I'm never going to be okay with
Christopher being in your life.

535
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:30,141
I'm always going to have
Christopher in my life.

536
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:31,917
Yeah.

537
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:37,348
He is... Rory's father. I can't change that.

538
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:44,700
Today was the first day I heard Christopher's
voice in a year, and I would have told you.

539
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,122
We can't hide things from each other.

540
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:48,043
I know.

541
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:52,031
I'm not going to like it when Christopher
calls, but we have to
tell each other everything.

542
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:52,903
Agreed.

543
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:54,533
That's the only way this is going to work.

544
00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:55,670
I know.

545
00:21:58,187 --> 00:21:59,756
You really hate the bedroom set?

546
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:01,933
Oh, I really hate the bedroom set.

547
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:04,494
But I'm sorry I told you like that.

548
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:05,853
Yeah, well...

549
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:10,085
So, how are Sookie and Jackson doing?

550
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:14,385
I think they enjoyed watching a show for once
that didn't have La-La playing the guitar.

551
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:16,489
Come here.

552
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:23,204
I want a barbie and a pony and roller skates

553
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:26,200
and roller skates for the
Barbie and for the pony.

554
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:33,430
No secrets?

555
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:35,118
Cross my heart and hope to die.

556
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,572
Oh, I hate that saying.

557
00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:37,941
No secrets.

558
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:44,712
- Luke.
- Yeah?

559
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:49,206
When I was in fifth grade, I told everybody
Erik Estrada was my boyfriend

560
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:51,870
and that we used to make
out on his motorcycle.

561
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:56,362
Stamford Eagle Gazette.

562
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:57,820
I'll transfer you.

563
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,519
Stamford Eagle Gazette.

564
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,100
I'll transfer you.

565
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:03,002
Stamford Eagle Gazette.

566
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:04,350
I'll transfer you.

567
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,106
Stamford Eagle Gazette.

568
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:06,990
I'll transfer you.

569
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:07,933
Did Bergman call?

570
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:09,319
Stamford Eagle Gazette.

571
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:11,822
Try the New York Times.

572
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:12,759
What?

573
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,613
Trust me. You want the times.

574
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:15,962
What are you pointing to?

575
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,055
She's pointing at me.

576
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:18,174
Stamford Eagle Gazette.

577
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,356
Rory Gilmore.

578
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:20,754
As you live and breathe.

579
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,940
Uh... I'm sorry. Did we--

580
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:24,287
No, we didn't have an appointment.

581
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:27,289
I thought I would come down here
and talk to you about a job.

582
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:27,944
A job?

583
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:29,959
A beginning staff writer job, to be exact.

584
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,983
I think maybe we got our
signals crossed earlier.

585
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:33,980
I thought I was clear.
I don't have any jobs available.

586
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:35,089
No, you were very clear.

587
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,156
You said you didn't have any jobs available,
and I heard you.

588
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,907
I have excellent hearing,
among my many other qualifications,

589
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:42,096
which I have listed here on my resumé,

590
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,528
and my portfolio-- samples of all my writing,

591
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:48,526
all my work from the Yale Daily News,

592
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:51,394
plus a couple spec pieces that
I've just recently finished,

593
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,990
ideas, potential pitches, theater reviews.

594
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:55,774
Well, I'm sure this is all--

595
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:57,472
I know this is very spur-of-the-moment,

596
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,148
but I thought you could find a minute
to sit down and talk with me.

597
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:01,107
About what?

598
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,333
About a job.

599
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:04,759
But I don't have any job openings.

600
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,825
I know, but earlier,
when we were on the phone,

601
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:09,230
you were so positive and optimistic.

602
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:10,927
You said so many complimentary things.

603
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,897
I mean, frankly, you made me sound great,

604
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:15,431
so great that I thought,
"hey, you should hire that girl."

605
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:19,202
I know most of the staff,
the rhythm of this place, how it runs--

606
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:20,206
I know where you keep the pens.

607
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:23,388
I have personally fixed the copier in that
coffee room on more than 10 occasions,

608
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,220
but the bottom line is... Mitchum was wrong.

609
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:30,169
I am a very good writer,
and I have great organizational skills,

610
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,341
yes, but I know how to come at an article.

611
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,150
I have a point of view, a voice, and--

612
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:37,388
big selling point-- I am a huge bargain.

613
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:39,841
Rory, these are wonderful points,
but I have nothing at this moment.

614
00:24:39,924 --> 00:24:42,255
If you could sit down and talk with me,
I bet we could work that out.

615
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:44,421
I have no time to sit and talk to you today.
I'm sorry.

616
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,670
Look, I have sent my resumé
to several other papers.

617
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:48,499
I'm not worried about finding a position.

618
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,455
I'm worried about finding the right position,
the right place for me.

619
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,135
I think this is the right place for me.

620
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:56,135
Well, it's not the right place for you,
because there is no place for you.

621
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,464
I have no job openings.

622
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,716
Give me 10 minutes of your time,
and I bet I can change your mind.

623
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,722
I don't have 10 minutes.

624
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:01,892
I would be invaluable to you here.

625
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:03,428
If I gave you a job, I'd have to fire Harry.

626
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:04,461
- Five minutes.
- Sorry.

627
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:05,518
That's okay.

628
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:06,511
I can wait.

629
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,062
Steaks and eggs, tuna melt.

630
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:16,447
I ordered onions on this.

631
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,400
Yes, you did. I'll be right back.

632
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:19,863
Caesar, I got onions coming.

633
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,189
This is not rare/medium-rare.
It's more like just rare.

634
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,847
Caesar, onions. Gimme.

635
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:25,301
Add a little medium to this rare.

636
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,247
The stove is going blinky.

637
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:28,209
No excuses. Let's go, go, go.

638
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:34,697
Cobb salad, no avocado, no bacon,
no blue cheese, Italian dressing on the side.

639
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,354
- Something to drink?
- Iced tea, two lemons.

640
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:40,144
Got it. Caesar, cobb salad, no cobb,
just turkey. Where's that burger?

641
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,440
- The stove is going--
- Blinky, I know. Use the broiler.

642
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:43,795
Luke Danes?

643
00:25:44,372 --> 00:25:45,652
Excuse me. Are you Luke Danes?

644
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:47,993
Yeah, grab a seat.
I'll be with you in a moment.

645
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:50,487
Iced tea, two lemons.

646
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,067
- But I didn't--
- You're Luke Danes.

647
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,394
Yes, kid, I'm Luke Danes.

648
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:55,864
What the hell are you wearing?

649
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:56,621
A bike helmet.

650
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:57,443
For what kind of bike?

651
00:25:57,531 --> 00:25:58,205
A schwinn.

652
00:25:58,295 --> 00:25:59,329
Okay.

653
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,008
When you fall off your bike,
you fall on your face.

654
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,167
You could lose your teeth or hurt your neck.

655
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:04,564
Whatever. What do you want to eat?

656
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:06,445
- Nothing.
- Then I need the stool space.

657
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:07,559
You told me to sit here.

658
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:08,903
I thought you were going to order something.

659
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,656
- Burger, rare!
- Where's my onions?

660
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,863
- I forgot the onions.
- Get my onions!

661
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:17,830
Look, kid, whatever you're selling--

662
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,787
I'm not selling anything.

663
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:21,543
I know, but I'm working.
Will you take that thing off?

664
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:22,541
Okay...

665
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,170
it takes a minute.

666
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,523
Okay...

667
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:31,082
it's off.

668
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:31,987
Can I talk to you now?

669
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:32,789
Talk fast.

670
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:33,687
I need your hair.

671
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:34,440
Excuse me?

672
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:35,375
With the roots.

673
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,014
For what?

674
00:26:36,103 --> 00:26:39,705
I go to Martin Van Buren middle school
over on Woodbridge-- do you know it?

675
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:40,277
No.

676
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:42,991
Well, every year Samuel Polotsky
wins the science fair.

677
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:46,019
Now, it's very important that I beat
him this year because I hate him.

678
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:47,676
This year I have the perfect project.

679
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,662
I'm going to take hair samples
from three men, run DNA tests,

680
00:26:50,738 --> 00:26:52,368
and figure out which one's my father.

681
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:53,468
What?

682
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:55,086
My uncle works for a lab in Hartford.

683
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,776
So he's going to oversee me,
but I'll be doing the work myself.

684
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,799
I'm sorry. Did you say your father?

685
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,135
See, science fairs have gotten
so political lately.

686
00:27:02,215 --> 00:27:04,763
It's no longer the simple act
of science being appreciated.

687
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:07,652
There's got to be a twist, a gimmick,
something flashy.

688
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:08,940
I figure this is perfect--

689
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:12,456
real science, DNA testing,
with a flash of human drama.

690
00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:13,539
"Who's my daddy?"

691
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,763
Huh? Catchy, right?

692
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:15,936
I don't understand. I'm not--

693
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,117
I have the other two samples.
This is my last stop.

694
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:20,443
I go to the lab tomorrow,
and the fair's on the 16th.

695
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,559
And if I win,
there's going to be a banquet on the 18th,

696
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:26,420
and you get to choose any two
kinds of spaghetti you want.

697
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,307
There's going to be at least 10 options,
though I know what I'm getting--

698
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:32,055
split order, half mushroom,
half muenster cheese.

699
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:32,647
No.

700
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:33,525
Yes, that's what I'm getting.

701
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:35,900
No. I mean, no. I'm-- ow!

702
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:37,782
Thanks.

703
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:40,403
Wish me luck!

704
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:50,068
We can't print the letters, Harry.

705
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:52,901
What if they're true? What if Gonzalez
really is taking these payoffs?

706
00:27:52,982 --> 00:27:55,138
It would make the city-council
elections interesting.

707
00:27:55,232 --> 00:27:56,871
We have no idea who's making
these accusations.

708
00:27:56,944 --> 00:28:00,062
It could be a hoax,
kids with too much time on their hands,
no dates for the prom.

709
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,817
It could be a rival candidate.
Wouldn't that be fun?

710
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:02,810
Yes, it would be fun.

711
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,856
Then let's have some fun.

712
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:05,199
- Hey, Rory.
- Hi, Harry.

713
00:28:05,276 --> 00:28:06,653
Okay, so, we don't print the letters,

714
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,507
but if we can track down the
person who's sending them.

715
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:08,950
How?

716
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,567
We do a paper analysis,
rummage through trash cans.

717
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:12,211
Very dignified.

718
00:28:12,306 --> 00:28:14,824
Or call the guy,
tell him we know he's sending the letters--

719
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:16,900
lie-- see if we can smoke him out.

720
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:19,977
You know, you can use language-analysis
software to ID an author

721
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:22,993
by comparing his writing style
to known writing samples.

722
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:23,573
What?

723
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:26,711
That's how Joe Klein was unmasked as
the author of "primary colors."

724
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:28,265
Hell, it's worth a try.

725
00:28:28,336 --> 00:28:29,021
Great.

726
00:28:29,984 --> 00:28:30,827
Good idea, Rory.

727
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:31,584
Thanks, boss.

728
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:32,538
I'm not your boss.

729
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:34,392
Not yet, boss,
but give me five minutes of your time.

730
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:35,343
I don't have five minutes.

731
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:36,644
Okay, I can wait.

732
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,767
Oh, boy.

733
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:39,109
You know where to find me.

734
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:45,310
More books.

735
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:47,520
What is wrong with people?

736
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:50,003
Don't they know the written word is dead?

737
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,790
Uh, books are back. Oprah says.

738
00:28:51,881 --> 00:28:53,087
Did we order the new box slips yet?

739
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,980
Yes, and the envelopes.

740
00:28:55,078 --> 00:28:57,082
And the linen-delivery service
has been replaced

741
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:59,753
by one that actually has trucks that turn on.

742
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:04,211
And I hired a horse whisperer because cletus
has been acting very needy lately,

743
00:29:04,302 --> 00:29:05,724
and I get enough of that from you.

744
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:06,858
Well, you're just perfect.

745
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:10,975
And I got a call from someone who
wanted a job reference for Rory.

746
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:11,891
What?

747
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,587
Don't worry. I said nice things.

748
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:16,926
I did not mention how she used to
steal stamps and sit in my chair.

749
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:19,948
I said she was very responsible
and a hard worker,

750
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,306
and now you owe me the weekend off.

751
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,360
A job reference?

752
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:23,459
- Yes.
- From who?

753
00:29:23,574 --> 00:29:24,151
Excuse me?

754
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:25,947
Who was calling? Who was inquiring?
Who was asking?

755
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:27,471
Someone who needed to hire someone.

756
00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:29,323
- What kind of job was it?
- I don't know.

757
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:30,416
What was the name of the company?

758
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:32,106
He told me but I do not remember.

759
00:29:32,192 --> 00:29:33,339
- Michel.
- What?

760
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,577
I'm not an answering machine.
I do not have "Sony" stamped on my forehead.

761
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:37,432
Michel--

762
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:38,608
Forget it.

763
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,710
Hello?

764
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:42,483
Lorelai, your mother's missing.

765
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:43,299
What?

766
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:46,260
I came home from Seattle,
and she wasn't here.

767
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,909
The bed doesn't look like it's been slept in.

768
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,689
You have maids, dad.
They probably made the bed.

769
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,198
Your mother fired the maid.

770
00:29:51,285 --> 00:29:53,212
As far as I know,
a new one hasn't been hired yet.

771
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,803
Plus, I haven't heard from her in two days.

772
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,263
I had a couple of phone calls yesterday,
but they were fuzzy.

773
00:29:58,341 --> 00:30:00,349
I couldn't hear the other person,
and then they hung up.

774
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:01,979
Well, that could have been mom.

775
00:30:02,085 --> 00:30:03,707
Rory's moved out. Did you know this?

776
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:05,209
Yes, I heard. What happened?

777
00:30:05,308 --> 00:30:06,636
I don't know what happened.

778
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:11,234
I came home the other day and two strange
boys were in my house moving Rory's things.

779
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:12,779
She didn't even tell me she was going.

780
00:30:12,863 --> 00:30:14,183
Did she and mom have a fight?

781
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:16,406
How would I know?
I don't know where your mother is.

782
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:17,636
Did you call her cell?

783
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,942
No, I did not call her cell.

784
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:23,546
In addition to losing my wife,
I lost all control of my faculties.

785
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:25,025
Of course I called her cell!

786
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:27,809
Well, I don't know what to tell you, Dad.
I haven't heard from mom or Rory.

787
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:28,984
I'm calling the club.

788
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:31,352
If you hear anything,
you must call me immediately.

789
00:30:31,442 --> 00:30:32,549
- I will.
- Don't be smart.

790
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:34,974
I'm not being smart.
If I hear anything, I'll call.

791
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:35,948
Fine.

792
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:41,827
Hey.

793
00:30:42,302 --> 00:30:43,253
What's wrong?

794
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:44,766
Is something wrong?

795
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:47,551
Are you upset? Did Luke bring home
his great-aunt's living room set?

796
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,308
I don't want coffee.

797
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:51,553
Okay, well, that's your choice.

798
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:52,891
Something's going on, Sookie.

799
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:54,162
- What?
- I don't know.

800
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,947
Rory moved out, and my mother is AWOL.

801
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:58,323
They must have had a fight or something.

802
00:30:58,402 --> 00:31:00,202
Something happened there, something big,

803
00:31:00,273 --> 00:31:02,473
and of course I don't have
Rory's cellphone number

804
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:05,371
because I had to give her space like a big,
stupid idiot.

805
00:31:05,455 --> 00:31:07,972
I should have my head examined.
Remind me to have my head examined.

806
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:09,215
Rory moved out?

807
00:31:09,306 --> 00:31:12,929
And my mother is missing,
and my father's a basket case,
and I don't know what to think.

808
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:16,513
Hi, mom, it's Lorelai. You have got to
call me when you get this message.

809
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:19,356
Dad is frantic,
and we don't know where you are,

810
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:21,574
so just call my cellphone
as soon as possible.

811
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,388
We just want to know that
everything's all right.

812
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:24,316
Okay, bye.

813
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:25,557
What do you think all that's about?

814
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:27,361
I don't know, but I'm going to go find out.

815
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:43,428
- Hey, Lorelai.
- Hey. Brian, I'm looking for Rory.

816
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:44,706
Oh, she's not here.

817
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:45,868
She is staying here, right?

818
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:46,407
Right.

819
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:49,412
And if you see her, you might want to mention
that we're mysteriously out of dish soap.

820
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:50,571
We're also out of sponges.

821
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,453
We are?
You didn't tell me we were out of sponges.

822
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:53,530
Lorelai, come on.

823
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:54,411
Come on what, Zach?

824
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:56,052
I'm just saying-- she's your daughter.

825
00:31:56,138 --> 00:31:57,776
Maybe you should chip in a little rent.

826
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,645
Zach, didn't you guys use my garage
as rehearsal space, rent
free, for about two years?

827
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:02,500
Three, actually.

828
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:03,965
Three years. Thank you, Brian.

829
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,537
So, I'll tell you what, Zach.
Why don't I give you $40 for Rory,

830
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:09,640
and you can give me $1,200 for the garage?
What do you think? We got a deal?

831
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:13,252
Hey, whoa, relax. I was just joking.
We're cool.

832
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:14,194
You want to come in and wait?

833
00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:15,789
I'm good. Thanks for the offer.

834
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,664
Hello? Mom, thank god.

835
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,065
Have you called dad?

836
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,012
Where are you?

837
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,973
What? What are you--

838
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:26,461
Okay, just stay there, mom.

839
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:28,818
Now, what was the hangar number again?

840
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:31,034
Mom?

841
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:32,568
I'm in the cockpit!

842
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:35,836
Add that to the list of things I never
thought I'd hear my mother say.

843
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,704
Hello, Lorelai. What are you doing here?

844
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:39,521
Oh, I was just in the neighborhood, you know.

845
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:40,836
How about you? What are you doing here?

846
00:32:40,945 --> 00:32:41,974
I'm looking at a plane.

847
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:43,031
Because?

848
00:32:43,114 --> 00:32:46,525
Because you don't buy a plane without
looking at it first. I'm not Elvis.

849
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,462
My mistake. I thought you were.

850
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,261
I apologize for sending those policemen
badges for Christmas.

851
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:53,041
Mom, dad is pretty worried about you.

852
00:32:53,126 --> 00:32:53,874
He is?

853
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:55,621
Yes, he said you didn't come home last night.

854
00:32:55,698 --> 00:32:56,621
I didn't?

855
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,645
He said the bed hadn't been slept in,
and you're between maids.

856
00:32:59,735 --> 00:33:01,048
For heaven's sake-- I did that.

857
00:33:01,135 --> 00:33:03,543
People don't even think I can make a bed?
I can make a bed.

858
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,925
I usually wind up remaking the
bed after the maid makes it

859
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:07,818
because she made it wrong the first place.

860
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:09,567
I wonder if these seats
could be moved around.

861
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:10,497
- Mom.
- Yes?

862
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:12,394
You're not going to buy a plane.

863
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,294
Tell your father I'm fine and
I'll be home in an hour.

864
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:15,881
Mom.

865
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:18,246
If you're not going to leave, then help.

866
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:19,922
Hold this up to the window.

867
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:22,401
This plane is a time-share.

868
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:24,368
We'll share it with three other people.

869
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:28,574
The pilot is always on call, which means we
can go anywhere we want at the drop of a hat.

870
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,158
Where would you want to go
at the drop of a hat?

871
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,496
Anywhere, everywhere.

872
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,070
I could travel with your
father when he works.

873
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:34,196
You can do that now.

874
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:37,108
I can join him later if I don't
want to leave when he leaves.

875
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,586
You can do that now.

876
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:40,403
Well, you and Luke can borrow it.

877
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:44,380
You can take it up to Maine for lobster
rolls or down to Florida for some sun.

878
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:47,027
This fabric is just horrible.
It all has to go.

879
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:48,787
Mom, you can't replace the fabric.

880
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:51,284
"Mom, you can't replace the fabric, mom,
you can't buy a plane."

881
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:53,630
It's a time-share.
You have to share it with three other people.

882
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,847
Then I'll buy the whole damn plane myself!

883
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,726
Okay, sorry.

884
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:59,927
You know what? I am tired of all this.
I am tired of your attitude toward me.

885
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,274
You look at me as a thing of amusement...

886
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:02,044
I don't.

887
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:03,751
...Something to be pitied, to feel sorry for.

888
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:05,803
"Poor, out-of-touch Emily. She has nothing.

889
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:08,155
She lives to organize parties
and frivolous affairs.

890
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,640
Who would want to do that? To be that?"

891
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:11,009
Mom, I've never thought that.

892
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,140
If I want a plane, I'll buy a plane!

893
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:14,826
Okay, good, go for it.

894
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,365
It's my fault that Rory dropped out of Yale.

895
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,822
It's my fault that she didn't go back.

896
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:20,442
It's my fault that she's with Logan,
that she's not happy.

897
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:21,741
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

898
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:22,779
It's not your fault.

899
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,741
That's right-- it's not my fault!

900
00:34:24,836 --> 00:34:26,718
I did nothing but take care of her.

901
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:29,933
I bought her clothes. I got her a job.
I guided her.

902
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:34,389
I threw parties for her and introduced her
to new people, new things, and she just...

903
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:38,052
The way she talked to me-- you
would have been very proud.

904
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:39,959
- No.
- Oh, yes.

905
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:42,205
She looked at me just like you used to,

906
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:46,727
with that defiant, "who are you to be
telling me what to do?" sort of look.

907
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,184
Then she left--

908
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:51,550
packed her things and moved out when
I wasn't even there to see her go.

909
00:34:51,748 --> 00:34:53,714
No "thank you." No "goodbye."

910
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:56,271
You would have been very, very proud.

911
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:57,311
Mom.

912
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,433
Just let me buy my plane, Lorelai.

913
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:02,310
Let me be frivolous and shallow,
won't you, please?

914
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:04,311
Okay.

915
00:35:11,357 --> 00:35:13,280
It's not the same, mom,

916
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:14,884
what happened with Rory.

917
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:16,567
It's not the same.

918
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:20,856
I lost her like I lost you.
It feels remarkably similar to me.

919
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:23,479
You didn't lose her like you lost me.

920
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,946
She was never supposed to be
there in the first place.

921
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:27,851
She was always supposed to be at school.

922
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:30,367
She just went back where she belonged.

923
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,996
And you didn't lose me.

924
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:48,603
Take that up with Mr. Abramson.

925
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:49,556
Hold, please.

926
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:50,849
Three sugars, nonfat milk.

927
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,268
Thank you, sweetheart.

928
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,628
God, you make good coffee.

929
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:56,220
I've had years of training.

930
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:57,317
You got someone on hold.

931
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,270
Right.

932
00:35:58,368 --> 00:36:00,488
Thank you for calling. How may I help you?

933
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:01,978
Rory Gilmore.

934
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:03,086
Yes, boss?

935
00:36:03,185 --> 00:36:04,405
Is this your portfolio?

936
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:07,053
Part of it.
I've got more here if you need it.

937
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:08,677
Clippings and pitches...

938
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:11,873
You do not go into other people's offices
and leave things on their desks.

939
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:12,663
I know. I'm sorry.

940
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,769
I'm the editor of this paper, for god's sake.
My office is private.

941
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:16,578
And very tidy.

942
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,052
Stay out of my office.

943
00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:23,259
Five minutes.

944
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:24,304
You read it?

945
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,367
I don't see you moving.

946
00:36:25,442 --> 00:36:26,644
Did you like it?

947
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,601
I remember something about
you being a bargain?

948
00:36:28,671 --> 00:36:31,216
Oh, thank you, boss.
You won't be sorry, boss.

949
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:33,824
Hey, you're not going to have to fire Harry,
are you?

950
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:20,399
Hi.

951
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:21,559
Hi.

952
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,723
What are you doing here?

953
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:26,821
Oh, I just came down to see the potato clock.

954
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:27,851
Hmm.

955
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:29,542
It's amazing a potato can do that.

956
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:31,546
Potatoes are extraordinary.

957
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,125
So, I guess, uh...

958
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,520
Yeah. It's you.

959
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,149
And you're sure?

960
00:37:38,243 --> 00:37:39,171
Absolutely.

961
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,444
You want to see my report?

962
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:42,510
Uh, yeah.

963
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:44,724
Oh. It's big.

964
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:50,829
Wow, you... sure wrote a lot of...
things here.

965
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,736
Hey, wait. There's a word in here I know.

966
00:37:56,488 --> 00:37:59,297
So, you're, uh... smart, huh?

967
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:00,626
I've never been tested.

968
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,747
But you... you did all this,
so you must be smart.

969
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:11,057
April Nardini? So, your last name is Nardini?

970
00:38:11,137 --> 00:38:11,785
Yes.

971
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,583
So, your mom is...

972
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,352
Anna.

973
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:17,415
Yes.

974
00:38:17,513 --> 00:38:20,272
Oh, Anna. Wow.

975
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:21,864
I haven't seen Anna in--

976
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,218
- About 12 years?
- Yeah.

977
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:27,339
So, uh... how is she? Is she good?

978
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:28,093
Yes.

979
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:29,763
Well, you know, that's...

980
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,677
Anna Nardini.

981
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:36,713
Oh, boy. Uh, I think I... I have to sit down.

982
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:38,619
- You want my stool.
- Yeah, thanks.

983
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:43,424
Thanks-- I'm just a little overwhelmed here.

984
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,368
You want a Capri Sun?

985
00:38:44,444 --> 00:38:45,950
No, that's okay.

986
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:51,552
So, I'm your father.

987
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:52,171
Yes.

988
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:53,849
I didn't know about you.

989
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:54,592
I know.

990
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:57,207
If I did, I would have, uh...

991
00:38:57,928 --> 00:39:00,306
Yeah, it's-- it's me. Hi.

992
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:03,016
I think I'm better now.

993
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:03,642
Are you sure?

994
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:05,557
Yeah. That's fine.

995
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:06,731
Okay.

996
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:11,521
So, sorry you didn't win.

997
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:12,404
It's okay.

998
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:14,063
I feel a little responsible.

999
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,070
The solar pizza oven took first.
Environmentalism is very in right now.

1000
00:39:18,157 --> 00:39:19,550
Right, well...

1001
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:22,994
Oh. Here.

1002
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,661
Oh, you can keep it. I've got copies.

1003
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:26,310
Okay, thanks.

1004
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,834
So, you want to get some
ice cream or something?

1005
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:35,689
I can't. The winners have to
give a presentation at 6:00.

1006
00:39:35,786 --> 00:39:36,886
Right.

1007
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:39,822
Should I stay?

1008
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,968
Why?

1009
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:42,449
Right. Okay.

1010
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:45,049
So, I guess...

1011
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:46,530
I'll go.

1012
00:39:46,632 --> 00:39:48,450
Okay. Thanks for coming by.

1013
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:49,855
Yeah. Thanks for the report.

1014
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,309
I'll pick up a scientific dictionary
on the way home, see if I
can figure out what it says.

1015
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:55,589
Norton makes a good one.

1016
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:58,014
Norton-- got it. Okay. Okay.

1017
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:02,448
Okay.

1018
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,114
There are some graham crusts that
people are not pre-baking

1019
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:24,776
before the cheesecake batter goes in.
So, this is getting to exactly--

1020
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,936
Hey. Paul Anka.

1021
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:41,495
Fetch.

1022
00:40:43,937 --> 00:40:46,670
Ah, that's it. Let it get a head start.

1023
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:49,458
Yes, hello?

1024
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:50,530
- Mom?
- Rory?

1025
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:52,421
- I got a job!
- What? Where?

1026
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:55,332
At the Stamford Gazette. It pays less
than I'll spend on gas to get there,

1027
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:57,381
but it's a job-- a writing job.

1028
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:58,064
Yes!

1029
00:40:58,135 --> 00:40:59,249
And I'm going back to Yale.

1030
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:01,926
I already called them and I talked
to my dean, and it's all arranged.

1031
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:04,898
I just have to find someplace to live,
but I'll figure it out.

1032
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:06,921
- And this is what you want?
- Yes.

1033
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:08,122
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1034
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:08,965
Oh, Rory!

1035
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:10,257
I moved out of grandma's house.

1036
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,454
Yeah, I know, I heard.

1037
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:13,259
- Are you home?
- Oh, no, I'm not.

1038
00:41:13,343 --> 00:41:14,890
Okay, I know you're home,
but can I come over?

1039
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,091
Yes! Yes! Come over!

1040
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:19,349
'Cause I'm staying at Lane's,
and I don't know if you want me to, but--

1041
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:21,876
Tell Lane you're moving out and get
your butt over here right now.

1042
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:24,064
Well, okay, if you insist.

1043
00:41:27,956 --> 00:41:29,579
Oh, my god.

1044
00:41:29,677 --> 00:41:30,217
What?

1045
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:33,014
You look just so much more
silver than I remembered.

1046
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:36,334
Now, come on. Is it too much to expect
after a lengthy separation

1047
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:38,979
to get some sort of heartfelt greeting?

1048
00:41:42,781 --> 00:41:44,182
Oh, I'm sorry.

1049
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,420
You're sorry? I'm sorry.

1050
00:41:46,512 --> 00:41:48,320
I was so mixed-up.

1051
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,099
I should have pulled you out of there.

1052
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:51,190
I was stupid.

1053
00:41:51,281 --> 00:41:52,507
No, I was stupid.

1054
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:53,728
I was more stupid.

1055
00:41:53,821 --> 00:41:56,473
Oh, boy. Time to get you back to Yale.

1056
00:41:56,577 --> 00:41:57,905
I love you, mom.

1057
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,593
Oh... kid, you have no idea.

1058
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:08,134
Rory's back.

1059
00:42:08,223 --> 00:42:08,614
What?

1060
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:09,678
She's back.

1061
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,192
She's back at home, she's back at school,

1062
00:42:12,277 --> 00:42:14,646
she got a job, and she did it all on her own.

1063
00:42:14,755 --> 00:42:18,752
She's at Lane's picking up her things, and
then we're going to pull a major all-nighter.

1064
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:21,808
We need burgers, fries, onions rings,
and anything else you can think of.

1065
00:42:21,877 --> 00:42:25,906
Oh-- I'm going to go next door and pick
up some ice cream at Taylor's.

1066
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,305
She's back.

1067
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,136
We can set the date.

1068
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:32,150
We can get married now because Rory's back.

1069
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,919
Don't skimp on the fries.
We don't want to lose her again.
