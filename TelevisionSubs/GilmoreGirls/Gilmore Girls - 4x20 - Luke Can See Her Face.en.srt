1
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:31,934
Hello?

2
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,424
- They know. 
- Who knows?

3
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:36,835
The cats -- they know that I've broken up with Jason and that I'm alone

4
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,174
and they've decided it's time for me to become a crazy cat lady.

5
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,641
- What are you talking about? 
- There's a cat on my doorstep.

6
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:43,418
Well, that's better than a bun in your oven.

7
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:45,049
It's just sitting there, staring at me,

8
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:46,327
like he knew this moment was coming.

9
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:47,704
It's still there. Why is it still there?

10
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:51,422
Mom, it's a stray. It's passing through. It's hanging out. Relax.

11
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:54,119
Move away from the window and go back to bed.

12
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,546
It's not fair. We just broke up. It just happened.

13
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,972
I'm still young. It's still possible that I'm gonna have a successful relationship.

14
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:03,017
- You don't know. My eggs are still viable. 
- Are you yelling at me or the cat?

15
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:05,579
The cat. I think he flipped me off with his tail. I'm Babette.

16
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,447
- Babette's not single. 
- Whose side are you on?

17
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:08,828
- Circle the wagons. 
- Sorry.

18
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,810
Everyone knows. They can see it in my face.

19
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,483
"She's single again. She couldn't make it work again.

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,586
She picked the wrong guy again." Hey, do not lick yourself in front of me.

21
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:19,750
Mom, I need you to get a grip. You're tired, you're stressed out,

22
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:22,136
- and you're not seeing things clearly. 
- Oh, my God!

23
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:23,723
- What? 
- There are two of them.

24
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:26,944
- They're not even easing me into this, those bastards. 
- I give up.

25
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:29,898
I guess I need to start collecting newspapers and magazines,

26
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:32,248
find a blue bathrobe, lose my front teeth.

27
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:35,606
Well, obviously, you've got a busy day ahead of you, so I'm gonna let you go.

28
00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:37,736
Yarn balls. I need to find some yarn balls.

29
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:38,304
Bye.

30
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,939
Hey, I am a young, desirable woman.

31
00:01:50,808 --> 00:02:54,011
Michel, curtains. Tom, banister and mud-sink valve.

32
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:06,580
Sylvie, horse feed. Jackson, garden stone.

33
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:08,741
Sookie, too much salt in gazpacho.

34
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:15,489
Oh, boy.

35
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:27,352
- What are you doing? 
- I need coffee.

36
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:29,451
It's 5:00 in the morning. Make coffee at your own house.

37
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:30,598
I did. I drank it all.

38
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:33,501
You drank all the coffee in your house before five in the morning?

39
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,498
- Big gulps, lots of sugar. 
- Alright, get up.

40
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,125
And just a little bit of cream 'cause it makes it cold.

41
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:38,928
Keep moving.

42
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:43,264
I can't sleep. I can't turn my mind off.

43
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,389
It keeps running and thinking and making lists.

44
00:03:45,978 --> 00:03:49,164
Maybe if you drank a little less coffee, you'd make a little less lists.

45
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,744
Oh, I can't stop drinking the coffee. I stop drinking coffee,

46
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:56,491
I stop doing the standing and walking and the words putting-into-sentence doing.

47
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:57,785
I'll make you some coffee.

48
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:04,032
If I could move, I would hug you. In fact, in my mind, I am hugging you,

49
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:07,851
and also, I'm telling the plumbers that there's no water pressure in rooms 10, 12, and 15.

50
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:10,206
- I'm making you some oatmeal. 
- I don't like oatmeal.

51
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,507
You've got to eat something healthy.

52
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:13,575
Oh, man, I'm so completely stressed.

53
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:15,906
I can't remember what I'm doing from one moment to the next.

54
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,732
- It's never gonna get done. 
- It will get done.

55
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,211
No, it won't get done, and the inn won't open,

56
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,736
and then I'll go broke. How do you do it?

57
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:22,654
Do what? Go broke?

58
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,758
No -- run this place, handle all the stress?

59
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:26,559
- The place isn't stressful. 
- It's not?

60
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:28,695
Well, actually, at this moment, it is a little.

61
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:33,150
Maybe I can't handle it. Do you think I can handle it?

62
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:34,762
- I already told you you could handle it. 
- When?

63
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:36,816
- Quite a while ago. 
- Did I believe you?

64
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:38,673
Apparently, you didn't even listen to me.

65
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,994
Oh, hey. I want you to take a tour of the inn.

66
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,896
Why don't I just wait till the place is repossessed? Then I can see it at public auction.

67
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:46,676
How can you be so mean to me when I only managed to line one of my eyes?

68
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:47,521
I apologize.

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,829
Seriously, I want to give you an official investors tour.

70
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:52,207
You should see the place. It's looking really good.

71
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:55,657
I heard the water pressure sucks in rooms 10, 12, and 15.

72
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:57,725
- What do you say? 
- You eat the oatmeal, I'll take the tour.

73
00:04:57,853 --> 00:05:00,767
Fine, I'll eat it. But I'm making a face the entire time.

74
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:01,893
Looking forward to it.

75
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:05,032
Oh, hey, Kirk.

76
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,988
Something wrong?

77
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,507
- I wanted to sit there. 
- Seriously?

78
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:18,016
Of course seriously. Why do you think I'm here this early?

79
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:19,255
I wanted to get that table.

80
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:21,426
Every single other table in here is empty.

81
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,450
Except the one I want.

82
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:24,207
Fine.

83
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:26,962
You have to understand that on days when Lulu is working,

84
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,183
- I have very little in my life. 
- I know, Kirk.

85
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:32,470
This table is a small thing, but it makes me happy.

86
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:34,216
It gives me a sense of power over my life,

87
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:37,294
a little control in a world where very little is controllable.

88
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:38,599
- Kirk. 
- What?

89
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:39,864
I moved. Your table's free.

90
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,193
Oh. Well... thanks.

91
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:43,944
You're welcome.

92
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,867
Boy, the light over here is excellent.

93
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,587
Is this your voice?

94
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,280
Michel, curtains. Tom, banister and mud-sink valve.

95
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,768
Yes, that's my voice. I left myself a couple of messages last night.

96
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:00,513
You left yourself 25 messages last night,

97
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:04,251
and the funny thing is, you didn't listen to any of the messages.

98
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:07,384
- I listened to the messages. 
- Just hand them to me, please.

99
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:10,097
Every day that you breathe, you make my life harder.

100
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:13,378
- Got a solution for you, Michel. 
- And when is the desk coming?

101
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:17,409
I don't find the whole conducting-business-on-the-floor thing amusing anymore!

102
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:22,016
I want a desk and a chair and a bell.

103
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:23,475
Where the hell is my bell?!

104
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:25,775
Hi. You came by.

105
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,473
- You told me I had to. 
- I'm so glad you're here.

106
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,525
Wow. The staircase is beautiful.

107
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:33,153
- Hey, Tom. 
- Luke.

108
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:34,530
Yeah, nice work here.

109
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:38,667
- But you used glue. I thought with a banister... 
- Oh, are you gonna kibitz?

110
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:39,164
What?

111
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:41,590
Guys who know a little about construction -- they build a birdbath,

112
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,679
install a towel bar -- makes them think they know something,

113
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,788
so they come in, they kibitz, offer a lot of free advice on things

114
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:49,399
they don't know anything about. I got a low tolerance for that right now.

115
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:52,676
- I'm not gonna kibitz. 
- Okay. And stop touching my banister.

116
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:55,640
He won't let me touch the banister either.

117
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:58,282
Hey, you want to see the kitchen? The stove is a thing of beauty.

118
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,775
We're thinking of just ordering out for everything so we never have to use it.

119
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,978
Great idea. And I wasn't gonna kibitz.

120
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,943
Exciting, isn't it?

121
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:09,532
Ohh. Lorelai, great. I've been looking for you.

122
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,388
- Hi, Luke. 
- Hey, Sookie.

123
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:14,676
- Nice kitchen. Did you use the original tiles? 
- I don't know. Ask Tom.

124
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,459
- Never mind. 
- What's up?

125
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,325
Lorelai, I would like to introduce you to Shel Sausman.

126
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:20,877
Shel, this is Lorelai Gilmore.

127
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:24,620
- It is really nice to meet you. 
- Well, it's nice to meet you, too.

128
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:27,779
- Shel is going to be our poultry supplier. 
- Oh, that's great.

129
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:31,751
He sells only free-range, hormone-free, and he's recently divorced.

130
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:34,706
Oh, well, I assume that one doesn't have anything to do with the other.

131
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,280
You're funny. She's funny.

132
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:41,049
You know, they say pretty women usually aren't funny

133
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,512
because they never had to be. Were you a fat child?

134
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:47,496
I'm gonna go out and check with Michel on something,

135
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:49,964
and you guys just talk till I get back.

136
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:51,561
Hey, what do you need to talk to Michel about?

137
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,461
- Tablecloth supplies. 
- I can do that.

138
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,754
Michel likes me better. Talk! Just talk!

139
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,340
- Listen, Lorelai... 
- Shel, have you met Luke?

140
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:00,960
Hey, Luke... Get up!

141
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,180
- Shel, this is Luke. 
- Nice to meet you.

142
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:07,976
- Yeah, you too. 
- Luke is my... special friend.

143
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:13,368
I have to tell you, renovating this place has been a real nightmare.

144
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:17,402
I just don't know how I would have gotten through it without him.

145
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:20,495
- Have I said thank you to you recently? 
- No.

146
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:23,807
- Oh. Well, thank you. 
- You're welcome.

147
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:27,698
Well, it was nice meeting you both. I'm just gonna go say goodbye to Sookie.

148
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,071
- Oh. Bye, Shel. 
- Bye, Shel.

149
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:31,364
- Don't touch my stomach. 
- You put my hand there.

150
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:33,269
She's trying to set me up with Shel, the poultry guy?

151
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,501
Why would she do that? I just broke up with someone.

152
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:38,563
We'd been dating for a few months now.

153
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,156
I figured there was someone in the picture.

154
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,052
You did? How?

155
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:44,308
Just clues. You know, you never dressed weather-appropriate, that kind of thing.

156
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:46,540
- Well I can bundle on up now. 
- I'm sorry.

157
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,803
- Cats came to my house today. 
- Really.

158
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,491
Because they know I'm a loser and I'm destined to be alone.

159
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,395
You're not destined to be alone. You have Shel.

160
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:55,500
Why is it so hard?

161
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:57,220
What, relationships? Look who you're asking.

162
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,028
- At least you got married. 
- At least you had a kid.

163
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:02,494
It makes me sad sometimes. Does it make you sad?

164
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:04,296
I don't know. Maybe.

165
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:06,739
I see Dr. Phil books in our future.

166
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:09,585
Unless they stock them at Home Depot, they're not likely to cross my path.

167
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:12,709
All this sad talk is putting a serious damper on my stressing.

168
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,516
The place is great.

169
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,010
- Do you think I can do this? 
- I already told you you can do this,

170
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:19,319
and I already told you that I already told you you can do this.

171
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,181
- You're making me long for Shel. 
- You'd never want for chicken.

172
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:26,517
Isn't political writing just another form of propaganda?

173
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:30,597
Absolutely not. Political writing confronts your assumptions.

174
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:32,940
- Propaganda can do that. 
- No, it cannot.

175
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:36,721
Propaganda merely reinforces what that person wishes to be told.

176
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:38,754
That means the definition is determined by the audience.

177
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:41,483
- That's one way of looking at it, yes. 
- You can't do that.

178
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,797
You can't define literature in terms of the audience.

179
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:46,470
Far be it from me to expect reason and common sense

180
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:49,835
to triumph above youthful omniscience, so for today,

181
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:52,056
we shall stop until next week.

182
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,333
- Rory, hi. 
- Stop it.

183
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,874
You know, I thought I would do some laundry tonight,

184
00:09:56,946 --> 00:10:00,020
and I don't quite have a full load of whites, so if you have some whites, toss them in.

185
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:02,077
I don't want to be your beard anymore, Paris.

186
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:03,310
Why don't you just go talk to Asher?

187
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,082
I don't take his class. People will get suspicious.

188
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:07,668
What, is he taking confession or something? You can't go.

189
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:10,380
Paris, come on. You know, I'm not gonna be in this class forever,

190
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:12,726
which means next year you're gonna have to find some other idiot

191
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:14,084
to stand here until the coast is clear.

192
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:16,341
That's alright. It's all going to be coming out eventually.

193
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:18,414
Asher asked me to go to Oxford with him this summer.

194
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:23,314
Oxford? Really? Oxford? That's -- wow. Oxford.

195
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:26,013
So, this is really getting serious.

196
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:28,624
There's now travel involved and as soon as news of the trip gets around,

197
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,344
- then I guess the secret is out. 
- I guess so.

198
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,418
Oh, crap. Pretend you have to see him in his office.

199
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:34,332
You were confused on the last point he made.

200
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:37,849
You were gonna ask him after class, but Toby from "American Splendor" wouldn't stop yapping and you couldn't.

201
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:40,186
I feel my mouth moving, something's coming out and yet...

202
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:41,296
Walk faster. We'll miss him.

203
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,883
- Did you find what you need? 
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

204
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:53,768
- What are you doing? 
- I have to ring them up.

205
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:57,704
I'll just tell you the prices. This one is $24.99.

206
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,154
- That high? 
- They're your prices.

207
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:00,726
- Can I just see the book? 
- I'm reading you the book.

208
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:03,967
It says right here. Oh, wait -- that's the Canadian price. $14.99.

209
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,216
Will you just let me scan the book?

210
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,766
When you scan the book, do you see the title?

211
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:08,903
- Yes. 
- Then no.

212
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,802
Luke, come on. What do you got there, porn?

213
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:11,928
- You sell porn? 
- No!

214
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:13,414
You think I brought my own porn in here to buy?

215
00:11:13,512 --> 00:11:15,676
I don't know what you're doing. I just need to scan the books.

216
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,150
This should cover it.

217
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,803
A hundred bucks? That's way too much.

218
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,094
Take it.

219
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:27,678
Bag.

220
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:58,623
- Love! 
- Jeez!

221
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:00,542
You want it? You can have it.

222
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:05,638
And not compromised, stifling, soul-killing love, but open, honest, life-affirming love.

223
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,551
But how do you get it? How do you get this love?

224
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:10,168
If I knew that, what the hell would I need you for?

225
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:13,323
It's going to take work. It's going to take introspection.

226
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:16,616
You're gonna have to learn new things -- how to be your own best friend,

227
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:19,610
how to treat your damaged psyche with a little kindness,

228
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:22,319
how to say, "hey, pal, you're worth it.

229
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:25,217
You mean something to someone, and you deserve love."

230
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:29,693
That is the key. If you crave love, then you deserve love.

231
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:34,302
Say that to yourself. If I crave love, I deserve love.

232
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,518
Now, how did that feel coming out? I'll bet it was hard.

233
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:43,445
I'll bet you felt ridiculous. Some of you may even have been incapable of saying it at all.

234
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:45,759
- Try again. 
- I'm not incapable.

235
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,997
I just haven't been hit in the head with the Oprah stick lately.

236
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,166
Trust me, my friend -- it will get easier,

237
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,215
until one day, you turn around, and you are not alone.

238
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,888
Ready to begin the journey? It's going to be one hell of a ride.

239
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:01,447
Okay, let's go. Open up your workbook to page one.

240
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,051
It doesn't get lower than this.

241
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:11,128
You know Dean, we appreciate you working late all this week.

242
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:12,649
Hey, I appreciate the extra cash.

243
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:18,419
Oh. The wire snapped. I can fix it.

244
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:21,610
- He's like a superhero. 
- He's like Super Mr. Fix-it man.

245
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,923
- We'll work on a name. 
- Your tool belt would glow.

246
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:24,896
I can't wait.

247
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:28,829
Hey, what did you think of the onion soup I made today?

248
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:31,071
- Oh, it was good. 
- Good enough for the opening?

249
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,709
No, we have to serve your critically acclaimed zucchini soup for the opening.

250
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:38,874
I know, but Jackson has some concerns about the zucchini crop,

251
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,680
- so I want to have a backup. 
- No, Sookie.

252
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:43,138
We've got to serve the zucchini soup. People are expecting it.

253
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:44,460
The zucchini have got to be there.

254
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,564
Well then, I'll just tell Jackson he has to have them.

255
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:49,093
- Dean, come on. 
- Lindsay, I'm working.

256
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:51,515
- Are you? How shocking. 
- What do you want me to do?

257
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:53,574
We're supposed to go out with Erika and David tonight.

258
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:55,924
- I can't! 
- So why would you say you could?!

259
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:58,489
Lindsay, I told you, if there was a chance for some extra hours...

260
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,097
- Oh, come on! 
- that I was gonna take it.

261
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:01,572
We never do anything, Dean.

262
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:04,106
We need money! God! You know that, Lindsay!

263
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:08,012
You are so incredibly selfish. You never think about me -- never.

264
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:10,112
You want a town house? You want a new car?

265
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:13,885
- We need money to pay for these things. 
- I sit at home all day waiting for you.

266
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:16,742
You never call during the day, like you always promise you will.

267
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,657
- God, Lindsay! 
- I'm bored, Dean.

268
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:23,158
Don't you care about that? I want to go out with my husband. Hello! We're married here!

269
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:25,379
I'll be done in a couple of hours. If you want to...

270
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,386
- I'm going out with Erika and David. 
- Fine. Go.

271
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,833
- When will you be home? 
- When I get home.

272
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,960
- That's nice, Lindsay. That's real nice. 
- Whatever, Dean.

273
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:41,830
Complete the following sentence -- I feel angry because...

274
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:43,535
I am listening to this tape.

275
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:47,846
- I feel hopeful because... 
- This tape must end eventually.

276
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:50,032
I feel helpless because...

277
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:52,358
I wonder if anyone's ever kicked an audiotape's ass.

278
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:54,487
Jeez. Hold on.

279
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,142
- What are you doing here? 
- Look how happy he is to see me.

280
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:05,290
- I just didn't expect it, that's all. 
- Oh, my brother.

281
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,743
- You remember T.J., right? 
- I'm still here.

282
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:09,832
- How you doin', T.J.? 
- How am I doing? 

283
00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:11,679
Lizzie, I don't know. How am I doing?

284
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:14,148
He's doing great! 'Cause we're getting married.

285
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:16,867
- Married? Really? 
- And we're doing it right here next week.

286
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:17,579
Wow, that's fast.

287
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:19,969
I know but we wanted to do it before the circuit got going

288
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:23,291
so all our friends could come. It gonna be so beautiful. Wait till you see.

289
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,426
- You ever been to a Renaissance wedding? 
- No, I haven't.

290
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,232
Oh, it's great -- horses, costumes, really big turkey legs. You're gonna love it.

291
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,800
- Okay, you gotta slow down here. 
- No way. You slow down and you die.

292
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:34,474
- When did this happen? 
- Last week.

293
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:37,643
T.J. asked me, I said yes, we made a few phone calls,

294
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:41,202
and here we are, grabbing life by the ping-pongs, as T.J. says.

295
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:42,799
Hey, there's gonna be a bachelor party, too.

296
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,955
My brother's coming down, got a couple of friends dropping in.

297
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:46,767
It's going to be a blast. You have to go.

298
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,778
- Oh, sure, if you want me to. 
- Want you to? Of course I want you to.

299
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,875
What are you talking about? I want you to be my best man also.

300
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:53,982
- You're kidding. 
- Of course I am.

301
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,773
You'd be like 800th on the list.

302
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:58,373
But you can come to the bachelor party if you want.

303
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:00,095
Are you happy for me? Say you're happy for me.

304
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:03,391
Sure, I'm happy for you. Of course I'll go to your bachelor party.

305
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:05,742
Good. Keeping up appearances that we like each other --

306
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:07,949
- very classy for the wedding. 
- T.J., come on.

307
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:10,504
Okay, I'm going to get some beer.

308
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,156
Where's he going? He doesn't know where to go.

309
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,805
He's got a nose for these things.

310
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:17,922
Oh, wait till you see this wedding.

311
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,837
Oh, my God. It's unbelievable.

312
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:23,442
- I'm wearing a white dress... 
- That is unbelievable.

313
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:26,776
Oh, stop it. It's about a zillion years old with flowing sleeves.

314
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:29,274
I'm like Vanessa Redgrave in "Camelot."

315
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:32,705
Seriously, I love myself in this dress.

316
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,790
Sounds like a good dress.

317
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:36,888
I'm so excited. I'm getting married... again.

318
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:41,505
So, how are you gonna do this so quickly?

319
00:16:42,212 --> 00:16:46,267
Well, we're gonna have the ceremony right out there in the square.

320
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:48,842
We've got our Renaissance Fair buds all pitching in.

321
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:53,348
We got the Scotch-egg guy to cater it and T.J.'s gonna write the vows.

322
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:54,762
- You won't have to do a thing. 
- Oh, sure.

323
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,661
I swear -- everything's taken care of.

324
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:58,818
- Carrie's gonna be my maid of honor. 
- Terrific.

325
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:00,778
- She's a good friend. 
- To one and all.

326
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:02,524
- So, does Jess know? 
- He knows.

327
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:04,218
- Did he take it well? 
- Took it like Jess.

328
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:04,890
Meaning?

329
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,986
- He's not coming. 
- Why not?

330
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:10,147
- He's young, he's busy. 
- Busy doing what?

331
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,304
I don't know. It's okay.

332
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:14,089
I just thought -- but it's no biggie.

333
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,126
- I mean, hey, I got you there, right? 
- Yeah, you do.

334
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,487
- Are you gonna dress up? 
- Absolutely.

335
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,638
- As a minstrel? 
- Sure.

336
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:22,804
Who's the guy who jumps around in bells and a pointy hat?

337
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,586
- The court jester. 
- Yes, the court jester.

338
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:25,744
I will come as a court jester.

339
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:28,088
You're a good brother.

340
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:31,709
You got any of that terrible peach pie you make? I'm starving.

341
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:35,716
- Hello. 
- Did you bring the Nutter Butters?

342
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:37,545
Well, I'm fine, Mother. I missed you, too.

343
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:40,485
- Ah, we have achieved culinary perfection. 
- What's with the carrots?

344
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,552
I was afraid you weren't eating right at school.

345
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:44,733
- Marshmallow? 
- Thank you.

346
00:17:45,574 --> 00:17:47,407
Oh, man, I've missed Al's Chinese night.

347
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,925
Oh, he's got a new thing now -- chicken chow mein sandwich.

348
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:51,426
- Oh, Al. 
- Oh, Al.

349
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:54,492
So what exactly was Grandma's excuse for canceling Friday night dinner?

350
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:57,104
- That Dad was traveling and she had a function. 
- It was that generic?

351
00:17:57,216 --> 00:17:59,980
She put no thought into it, and it was muffled, but at the end of the call,

352
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,823
I do believe I heard a knock and someone yelling, "turndown service."

353
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:04,963
- Living in a hotel. 
- And hiding it.

354
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,454
Poor Grandma. We should talk to them.

355
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,204
- "We"? 
- Well, you. I'm a child.

356
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,676
Talking is not my parents' thing.

357
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:13,048
It would humiliate them if they knew that we knew that they are...

358
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:15,290
- whatever they are. 
- So, we do nothing?

359
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,785
I guess we wait until one of them cracks.

360
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,936
Okay. Man, how many tapes are we watching tonight?

361
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:21,681
Well, every time I started watching something that I thought you would like,

362
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,915
I stopped watching it and I saved it for when we could watch it together,

363
00:18:24,988 --> 00:18:26,821
so I watched the first 10 minutes of 12 movies.

364
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,310
So which one are we gonna watch?

365
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:31,481
The absolute funniest movie known to man --

366
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,229
- "Fatso." 
- I'm loving the title.

367
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:37,281
- Anne Bancroft wrote and directed it. 
- Well, Annie Sullivan, look at you go.

368
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,100
So how's everything at the inn coming along?

369
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:43,917
Everyone's freaking out because I got a million things to do,

370
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:46,697
but we finally got the pictures up, and the beds were delivered today.

371
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,764
Oh, I forgot -- a little bit of gossip.

372
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:52,205
- Oh. What? 
- No, it's not fun gossip.

373
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:53,103
What? What?

374
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:55,969
Well, Sookie and I overheard Dean and Lindsay having a major fight.

375
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:59,174
- It was ugly. 
- Really? About what?

376
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:01,996
Well, she was mad because he was working late to make some extra cash,

377
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,064
and she wanted to go out, and it got heated and vicious,

378
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:07,130
and the whole thing ended with a "Whatever, Dean."

379
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:08,739
- That sounds bad. 
- It wasn't good.

380
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:11,001
- Maybe they'll make up. 
- I hope so.

381
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,804
Yeah, me too.

382
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:15,743
Fat! Fat! Fat!

383
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:18,415
- This is the greatest thing I've ever seen. 
- Kiss for Mommy.

384
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:34,257
Hey, neighbor, the guys next door just ran out of crack to sell,

385
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:37,451
so they sent me over to borrow a cup. Hey, nice place.

386
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,798
You put those holes there yourself?

387
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:41,798
What are you doing here?

388
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:43,898
- Just wanted to see how you were doing. 
- Doing great.

389
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,233
Great, you're doing great. Wow, you're doing great.

390
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:47,983
I'm not doing great, and I have running water.

391
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:50,421
- The place is fine. 
- Fine. Not great? What happened to great?

392
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:53,355
- All this and no housewarming gift. 
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

393
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,326
I just thought you were going absolutely nowhere with your life.

394
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:59,064
Glad I'm wrong. Hey, which filthy mattress is yours?

395
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,006
Right there.

396
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:02,423
Oh. Well, you got the good corner, with a view of the mold.

397
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:05,770
Yeah, I won the toss. Now, if you don't mind, I've got places to be.

398
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,293
Let's get down to it. Liz told me you weren't coming to the wedding.

399
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,742
- No way you're here about that. 
- I am here about that.

400
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:12,771
- Why? 
- Why?

401
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,911
Your mother's getting married, and you're not coming.

402
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,897
No biggie. I'll just catch the next one.

403
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,037
- Jess, this guy is different. 
- Come on.

404
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:21,228
Well he could be different. He seems different.

405
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:23,395
- Jeez, man. 
- I've seen him with Liz.

406
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:27,532
They seem to work. We need to support this thing to give it a chance.

407
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:28,478
No, we don't.

408
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:31,480
- You are gonna regret this. 
- I doubt it.

409
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:32,922
No, you are.

410
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:35,176
If you ever manage to grow up and get yourself together

411
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:39,077
and drop this selfish self-destructive behavior that you are so fond of, if that ever happens,

412
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,812
you are gonna look back on this moment and you are gonna feel

413
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:44,877
like a big steaming mound of crap that you missed this.

414
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:46,173
This could have been a turning point.

415
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:48,488
You could have witnessed something good for your mother who, yes,

416
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:52,312
has screwed up a bit in her life but now seems to have found something to make her happy,

417
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:54,555
and you miss that, you refuse to be a part of that,

418
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:56,281
you are gonna be very sorry.

419
00:20:57,996 --> 00:20:59,332
What, are you a drug dealer now?

420
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:01,800
I'm a messenger. I gotta go. Hey, Todd, it's 4:00.

421
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:03,633
You owe me.

422
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,562
I was there for you when no one else was,

423
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,732
and I want you there... and you owe me.

424
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,417
I gotta go.

425
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:10,514
So do I.

426
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:12,838
I'm going first.

427
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:14,641
Hey, Todd.

428
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:22,347
No, Roy, I know what I'm talking about. I'm looking for stalks of wheat,

429
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:23,950
not processed wheat, stalks.

430
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:27,767
That's putting it another way. I need bare-ass stalks. Sorry.

431
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:32,182
I know you can't eat it like that. I just need it for decoration.

432
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:35,275
No, I'm not going poofy on you, damn it! Sorry.

433
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:39,632
I just need to know whether you have it or not. No? Okay, whatever. Thanks.

434
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:42,750
Is there no wheat left in this country? What happened to Kansas?

435
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:46,145
- Isn't Kansas lousy with wheat? 
- I do recall Toto running through fields of it.

436
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:47,649
- Coffee to go, please. 
- That I can get.

437
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,160
- Why do you need wheat? 
- Liz's wedding.

438
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,029
- Liz is getting married? 
- She and T.J.

439
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,345
- Did I know this? 
- I guess not.

440
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,951
- In New York? 
- Here in the square, a Renaissance thing.

441
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:58,341
- Could I be a little more behind? 
- I got sucked in, just like always.

442
00:21:58,428 --> 00:22:01,074
First day, their cellphone died, so I let them use the phone.

443
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:04,259
Then I offered to make the call 'cause I happened to know the person they were calling,

444
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,661
and I had to go pick something up because I couldn't find T.J. to do it.

445
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:10,009
And kapow, I'm hunting down wheat stalks and looking for local pewter craftsmen.

446
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,899
Do you have any idea where I can find myrtle?

447
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:13,614
- Did you check the bingo parlor? 
- The plant.

448
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:16,031
Hey, don't add stuff from your to-do list to my to-do list.

449
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,609
- Sorry. Here's your coffee. 
- Thank you.

450
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,357
So, I can't believe I didn't know about this wedding.

451
00:22:20,394 --> 00:22:22,200
- I'm caught up on everything now, right? 
- I'd say so.

452
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:24,321
I'm not paying for a motel, so I'm staying with you.

453
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,195
Liar!

454
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:28,835
I wasn't sure he was coming. I went to see him in New York.

455
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,976
You went to New York? I needed things picked up in New York.

456
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:33,342
Hey, don't add stuff from your to-do list to my to-do list.

457
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:34,734
- Sorry. 
- It's okay.

458
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:35,631
I should go.

459
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,527
Hey, do you know that if the entire population of China walked by,

460
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:42,098
the line would never end because of the rate of population increase?

461
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,748
No, I didn't.

462
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,138
That's my list -- every Chinese person in the world.

463
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,290
- Scary. 
- Scary.

464
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:49,608
What do you think? Friday night good?

465
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,567
- I'm busy, Glenn. 
- You're never busy on Friday nights.

466
00:22:52,628 --> 00:22:56,116
You always eat dinner early on Fridays and watch TV and go to bed around 10:30.

467
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,484
You're spying on me?!

468
00:22:57,754 --> 00:22:59,832
Close your blinds if you're gonna be so sensitive.

469
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:01,907
Hello?

470
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:03,621
Paris, slow down.

471
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:05,137
Where are you?

472
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:09,084
Stop saying "the hospital." There are tons of hospitals. Which hospital?

473
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:13,569
- Ah, you're here. 
- I do show up occasionally.

474
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:14,798
The place looks the same.

475
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:16,237
Is that your dinner?

476
00:23:16,683 --> 00:23:18,521
Couldn't book my usual table at Le Cirque.

477
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:19,340
Right.

478
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:22,894
I wasn't sure what food I could eat.

479
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,793
Eat what you like. Start with the expired stuff.

480
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:26,839
Maybe I'll go out.

481
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:29,115
I'm hearing a good buzz about a chow mein sandwich.

482
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:32,797
What's on the playlist these days? I'm guessing Jethro Tull or Jethro Tull.

483
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,455
- Just stay away from that. 
- What's with you?

484
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,937
Never mind. Look, eat my food, use my shower. Just don't go poking around my stuff.

485
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,405
- Mr. Sensitive. 
- Whatever. Enjoy your evening.

486
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:41,443
Don't wait up.

487
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:50,071
You're a road in need of some repair.

488
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:54,562
If your score is between 30 and 40 points, then you're a road laden with potholes

489
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:57,863
and you need a double striping. And if your score is 40 or above,

490
00:23:57,997 --> 00:24:01,064
it's jackhammer time because your road is impassable.

491
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:01,759
Yikes.

492
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:03,158
Chapter 7.

493
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:07,105
Men, a question -- what is fantasy?

494
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:11,831
The answer -- fantasy is the imaginative fulfillment of your heart's desire.

495
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,360
And one of the most common fantasies for single men

496
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:16,864
is the fantasy of your ultimate companion.

497
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,119
Yada yada yada.

498
00:24:18,738 --> 00:24:21,944
Story time. I had a friend -- let's call him Phillip --

499
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:25,287
who couldn't make up his mind amongst three different women that he liked.

500
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:28,937
I developed a test for him... and for you.

501
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:29,805
Oh, goody.

502
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:33,828
Whose phone calls or visits are never unwanted or too long?

503
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:35,722
Do you see her face?

504
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:40,104
Who would you most like to have in your life to ward off moments of loneliness?

505
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:41,696
Do you see her face?

506
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:46,077
When you travel, who would make your travels more enjoyable?

507
00:24:46,816 --> 00:24:48,041
Do you see her face?

508
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,988
When you're in pain, who would you most like to comfort you?

509
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:53,672
Do you see her face?

510
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:56,918
When something wonderful happens in your life

511
00:24:57,118 --> 00:25:00,036
-- a promotion at work, a successful refinancing --

512
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:02,297
who do you want to share the news with?

513
00:25:03,196 --> 00:25:04,363
Do you see her face?

514
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:07,317
Whose face appears to you, my friend?

515
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,396
Whose face?

516
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:21,971
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I'm not sure which floor to go to.

517
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,793
I've been getting conflicting advice.

518
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:28,202
A friend of mine is here, but she didn't say exactly where, so I'm just wondering...

519
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:30,675
Why do I have to say everything twice? Why?

520
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:33,542
I don't want my time wasted that way. You don't want your time wasted that way.

521
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:36,373
Lives are dependent on you very people not wasting your time.

522
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,724
I came here because of your reputation.

523
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,362
Don't make me destroy that reputation.

524
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,381
Miss, you have to lower your voice.

525
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:43,941
That is Professor Asher Fleming in there, of Yale University.

526
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:47,596
He's an important man, and you're acting like you're about to sell his spleen to UCLA.

527
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:49,020
The procedures are the procedures.

528
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,349
Oh, really? I thought the procedures were a hat.

529
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:53,187
Hit me with some more lame tautology, Socrates.

530
00:25:53,372 --> 00:25:56,659
That's enough. Now, calm down, take a seat, and let us continue our work.

531
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:59,939
Oh, you men, always telling us to calm down. Me, Hillary, Martha,

532
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:02,250
the second we make a squeak, you're pushing us onto the fainting couch.

533
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,601
- Honey, please. 
- Paris.

534
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:05,905
Asher asked for a moistened towel 20 minutes ago,

535
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:07,576
and no one's brought him a moistened towel.

536
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:10,607
This man is an award-winning novelist, a sought-after lecturer.

537
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,985
He deserves a moistened towel! Give me a towel! I'll moisten the damn thing myself!

538
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:15,669
Paris, come on. Fill me in here.

539
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:18,076
Stat! Stat! Do you not know what "stat" means?

540
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:21,091
- They say it on all the hospital shows. 
- Come on, Paris. What's happening?

541
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,674
- It's Asher. 
- I know, what's happening?

542
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:25,034
We were out getting some gelato and he dropped his spoon,

543
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:28,136
and when I picked it up, he started to lean on me like he was about to fall,

544
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:30,794
- and he was having these pains. 
- Oh my God.

545
00:26:30,907 --> 00:26:32,608
So we sat down, and he said he was fine,

546
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,270
but I got worried because he looked so pale,

547
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:37,778
so I rushed him here to this chop shop masquerading as a hospital,

548
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:39,232
and I can't get anyone to help him.

549
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:41,526
This is a really good hospital. They know what they're doing.

550
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:43,103
- He wanted a towel. 
- They'll get him one.

551
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,515
And they wouldn't let me see even him because I'm not a blood relative.

552
00:26:45,694 --> 00:26:47,563
He's got two grown kids. Where are they?

553
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:50,035
I mean, you put food on their table, a roof over their heads,

554
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,161
- and this is how they repay you? 
- What's doctor saying? Is it serious?

555
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:56,496
It wasn't a heart attack. It was angina or something. I think he's gonna be fine.

556
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,675
- Good. 
- But...

557
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:58,509
But what?

558
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,959
The wobbly, the look on his face, the angina...

559
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:04,269
- he's old. 
- What?

560
00:27:04,402 --> 00:27:06,225
Asher. He has pains, he wobbles.

561
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,072
I spotted him through the curtain when the doctor came out,

562
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:12,659
and he was just lying on that bed all alone, and he had his eyes open

563
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:14,299
and was just staring at the ceiling.

564
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,503
- He looked so close to death. 
- He's not that close.

565
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:18,529
He's closer than me.

566
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:22,215
An anvil could hit you on the head tomorrow, and he could live another 40 years.

567
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:25,185
I'm 19. I should be rollicking. Asher doesn't rollick.

568
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:27,796
Well he probably didn't rollick when he was younger either. He's British.

569
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,895
You should have seen the way he was staring at the ceiling,

570
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:32,362
- like he was looking at God. 
- He wasn't looking at God.

571
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:34,533
You've probably been laughing at me all these months.

572
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:36,065
- Paris, no, I haven't. 
- I'm in a hospital.

573
00:27:36,162 --> 00:27:39,367
I should be at a discotheque. Are kids still into the discotheque?

574
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:42,198
Paris, come on. Let's go get you something to drink. Let the hospital do their work.

575
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,003
He orders old gelato.

576
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,236
- Old gelato? 
- Vanilla. It's a very old flavor.

577
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:49,848
Oh, I hate these pillows with a passion.

578
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:51,712
- They look good. 
- Good, not great?

579
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,324
- They look great. 
- Great, not fabulous?

580
00:27:53,544 --> 00:27:55,126
- Fabulous. 
- Fabulous, not mondo-fabulous?

581
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,842
- Come on. 
- They look good to me.

582
00:27:56,985 --> 00:27:58,030
- Good, not great? 
- Lorelai.

583
00:27:58,152 --> 00:27:58,879
Twenty-eight to go.

584
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:01,614
Does it bother you that the word "laundry" is misspelled?

585
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:05,521
No! I proofed these pages a million times.

586
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:09,785
That breaks my heart. L-a-u-n-d-r-y. That's right.

587
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:13,350
- No, it's d-r-i-e. 
- No, laundry -- l-a-u-n-d-r-y.

588
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:15,737
- There's a "u?" There's no "u." 
- There's a "u" but no "y."

589
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,415
There's a "y" but no "i-e," and a "u."

590
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:19,238
- Or a "u." 
- No, no. There's a "u."

591
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:22,171
There's no "i-e." It's a "y" -- this is giving me a headache.

592
00:28:22,443 --> 00:28:24,439
Does "consomm�" have two m's?

593
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:27,132
- Hey, Abbott, just assemble the books. 
- It's getting late.

594
00:28:27,394 --> 00:28:29,841
- How late can you stay, Sookie? 
- As late as you want --

595
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:32,750
Davey's with his grandparents, and Jackson's sleeping with the zucchini tonight.

596
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:35,550
- What's that, farm jargon? 
- No, he's sleeping with the zucchini.

597
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,389
But what does that mean, sleeping with the zucchini?

598
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:39,554
It means he's sleeping with the zucchini.

599
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:42,393
Sookie, fill me in here. Where's Jackson?

600
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:45,345
Well, he checked the forecast today, and there's a potential cold front

601
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,464
coming in from Canada, and he knows how important

602
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,231
the zucchini is for opening day menu, so...

603
00:28:49,364 --> 00:28:51,238
Are you saying that "sleeping with the zucchini" means...

604
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,522
He's sleeping with the zucchini.

605
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,255
She's said it four times. You're very slow tonight.

606
00:28:56,383 --> 00:28:57,243
Oh my God.

607
00:28:57,531 --> 00:29:00,464
Well, you said to do whatever it takes to make sure we have fresh zucchini.

608
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,154
- Within the realm of reason. 
- Oh. Now you add that.

609
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,994
- Where are you going? 
- To the zucchini patch.

610
00:29:07,198 --> 00:29:09,353
- All of us or... 
- Michel!

611
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:14,754
- Boys, we have arrived. 
- You said it, brother, my brother.

612
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:19,936
- Stomachache? 
- I'm fine.

613
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:22,604
- Check out the fresh nooks. 
- Nice and fresh.

614
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:24,451
- Not your scene? 
- Not really.

615
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:25,459
Mine neither.

616
00:29:26,274 --> 00:29:29,398
This is for the guys. These days, there's nothing I'd rather do in the world

617
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:30,790
than spoon with your sister.

618
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,431
- Stomach again? 
- That time, yeah.

619
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:36,346
Let's grab seats before they're all taken.

620
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,566
- Lap dance? 
- Oh, no, thanks.

621
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,915
- I'm just here for a bachelor party. 
- That's kind of why I'm here, too.

622
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,881
Well, thanks for the offer, but, no, thank you.

623
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:50,579
But thank you. It was nice. Thanks. Thank you.

624
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,455
Thank you.

625
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,998
Luke, come on. You should get a lap dance.

626
00:29:55,111 --> 00:29:56,596
- I'm fine. 
- Are you gonna stand all night?

627
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:59,324
If I stand, there's no lap to dance on. Everything will be easier.

628
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,485
- Wow. That's something there. 
- What's is?

629
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:05,525
What you just said about your lap. The fact is, there is no such thing as a lap.

630
00:30:05,642 --> 00:30:06,743
- Come on. 
- Think about it --

631
00:30:06,912 --> 00:30:10,215
it's there when you're sitting, but it's gone when you stand, so where does it go?

632
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:14,404
It doesn't go anywhere, meaning... it never was.

633
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,372
So a lap is just an illusion.

634
00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:20,086
Whoa. The way his mind works.

635
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:21,418
Oh, it's something else.

636
00:30:22,283 --> 00:30:25,181
- Where have you been? 
- Bathroom. It's best to use it before the puking starts.

637
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:27,587
You left me hanging with the Lords of Flatbush here.

638
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:28,345
Sorry.

639
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:34,274
- Aren't you gonna sit? 
- He doesn't want to make a lap.

640
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,784
- A lap is an illusion. 
- What?

641
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:38,257
- Don't get him started. 
- Hey, I want to talk to you later.

642
00:30:38,396 --> 00:30:39,752
I always enjoy a good palaver.

643
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:41,038
We'll talk.

644
00:30:52,138 --> 00:30:53,878
Thanks for the drink. I owe you.

645
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:55,097
You don't owe me anything.

646
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:57,320
- You can go in now. 
- Thank you.

647
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,258
Well, I think I'm going to go talk to him.

648
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:03,868
And have the talk -- a real talk.

649
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:06,648
- Oh. Now? 
- This can't go on. It's too weird.

650
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:09,762
- Tonight's been sort of an eye-opener. 
- Well, it's up to you.

651
00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:12,828
We're supposed to leave for England in two weeks. I shouldn't string him along.

652
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:16,370
Right. Now is good, and to do it is good... for a number of reasons.

653
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:17,123
What reasons?

654
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:19,960
I just meant all the reasons that you already know.

655
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,346
- Wait for me -- take me home? 
- Yeah. I'll be right out here.

656
00:31:25,823 --> 00:31:26,386
Asher?

657
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:27,495
Paris?

658
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:29,443
Come, come.

659
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:33,825
- You needn't have stayed. 
- Oh, no.

660
00:31:34,383 --> 00:31:37,711
- I mean, I had the keys. 
- Then it was very convenient that you did stay.

661
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,574
- Did you ever get your towel? 
- Five of them.

662
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:42,160
And I'm very grateful. Thank you, angel.

663
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:45,473
- Yes? 
- Are you feeling better?

664
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:48,070
- Oh, I'm feeling much better. 
- Good, good. I'm glad.

665
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:51,101
I mean, you read all these awful stories in the paper --

666
00:31:51,198 --> 00:31:54,504
you know, a guy comes in with a stomachache, and they amputate his foot.

667
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:55,186
Paris...

668
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:57,367
come sit down.

669
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,324
You know, a hospital seems a wonderful place

670
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:08,360
to discuss something serious, doesn't it?

671
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:09,584
I guess.

672
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:14,531
I want you to know that I'm grateful for every moment

673
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:16,377
that we've spent together this past year.

674
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:19,071
You're wonderful company.

675
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:24,053
- I don't think I've said that enough. 
- No. You have.

676
00:32:24,514 --> 00:32:29,101
You know, I've had other relationships like this.

677
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,586
You may have heard talk.

678
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:33,771
Oh, I rarely listen to anything anybody says.

679
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:37,191
I didn't want you to think that I was hiding anything.

680
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:39,546
- I want to be honest with you. 
- Thank you.

681
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,954
There's something very unique about you, Paris,

682
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:46,079
quite out of the ordinary.

683
00:32:46,822 --> 00:32:48,435
A lot of people have said I'm not ordinary.

684
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,087
You know, I'm going to be very busy at Oxford.

685
00:32:58,531 --> 00:33:01,562
I've been writing down all the places that I wanted to take you,

686
00:33:01,674 --> 00:33:05,771
things you should see, but I'm afraid there's not enough time.

687
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,112
So, I was thinking of going alone. Oh, I'd like you to go,

688
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:13,630
but I don't want you to be bored.

689
00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:15,437
You've been writing down places?

690
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:16,933
I'd forgotten how many there were.

691
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:21,827
So, if you want to reassess,

692
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:24,826
- I will completely understand. 
- Do you...

693
00:33:26,056 --> 00:33:29,312
- want to reassess? 
- No. I don't want to go alone,

694
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,760
and I don't want to go with anyone else.

695
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:34,341
But, then, I'm selfish.

696
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:36,244
I get to be.

697
00:33:37,296 --> 00:33:39,185
After all, I'm... old.

698
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,635
You're not so old.

699
00:33:47,581 --> 00:33:49,285
Hi. I'm looking for Asher Fleming.

700
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:51,846
He's getting dressed. He should be out in a minute.

701
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:53,002
Thank you.

702
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:01,795
He'll be all yours in a minute, girlfriend.

703
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:06,566
- Miss Gilmore. 
- Hello, Professor.

704
00:34:07,017 --> 00:34:07,904
- You ready? 
- That's okay.

705
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,119
I'm going to go with Asher. We're going to do some more planning for England.

706
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:12,511
England? But I thought...

707
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,195
- Andrea, what brought you here? 
- Mom called.

708
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:17,936
Paris, Rory, this is my granddaughter, Andrea.

709
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:23,194
Hey, there. Wow. It's really nice to meet you.

710
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,313
I'm gonna be going home now because there's no rest for the wicked.

711
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:28,700
- So I'll see you at home. 
- See you there.

712
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:32,576
I'll just see you in class there, Asher -- Professor.

713
00:34:32,961 --> 00:34:35,004
It's really nice meeting you. Bye.

714
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:41,082
I love mud, I love wrestling, I love girls. This is everything I love.

715
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:42,499
In one neat package.

716
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,688
Here's our boy. You having a good time?

717
00:34:46,882 --> 00:34:48,213
Oh, I'm having a gay old time.

718
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:51,444
You know, you read so much, I'm thinking of nicknaming you "Reads."

719
00:34:51,691 --> 00:34:53,200
- Good one. 
- Tough guy, huh?

720
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:53,804
What?

721
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:56,768
Listen, your mom has this thought she hasn't shared with you

722
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:58,561
because she's afraid you wouldn't be into it.

723
00:34:58,689 --> 00:34:59,538
Oh yeah?

724
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,121
She'd like you to walk her down the aisle.

725
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,121
Usually it's the father that would do that, but he's worm food.

726
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,058
I knew that.

727
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,865
So, what do you say?

728
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:09,571
- I don't think so. 
- She really wants you to.

729
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:10,650
I really don't want to.

730
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:12,805
- I'd like it, too. 
- Oh, you too?

731
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:14,059
- Yeah. 
- I don't think so.

732
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,128
It's a really short aisle. It'll be over in a flash.

733
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:18,571
- Get Luke to do it. 
- She wants you to do it.

734
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:20,418
I guess we're at a stalemate.

735
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,390
I don't think we're at a stalemate.

736
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:27,161
There's girls wallowing around in slimy dirt, and you're looking at me?

737
00:35:27,345 --> 00:35:29,398
- I don't want to tell your mom no. 
- Then I'll tell her.

738
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:30,888
I don't want you telling her either.

739
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,250
Want to pitch in for a telegram?

740
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:38,594
Knock it off! Knock it off! Come on, knock it off!

741
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,159
That's it. This whole group out.

742
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:46,275
Best bachelor party ever!

743
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:51,410
Oh, my God. I hate nature.

744
00:35:52,588 --> 00:35:53,556
Jackson!

745
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:56,135
- What are you doing here? 
- What are you doing here?

746
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,875
I'm sleeping with the zucchini. Didn't you tell her that I was sleeping with the zucchini?

747
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:00,785
She had a little trouble grasping that concept.

748
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:02,981
I do not want you to sleep with the zucchini.

749
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:05,229
- You said it was important. 
- They are.

750
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:07,231
And to keep them safe, no matter what it takes.

751
00:36:07,594 --> 00:36:10,261
- And there's a possibility of a cold front. 
- I told her about the cold front.

752
00:36:10,354 --> 00:36:11,311
That's why you have heaters.

753
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,482
But the heaters could fail, so I'm here to service them.

754
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:15,464
- So technically, you're sleeping with the heaters? 
- I guess so.

755
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,757
- But I don't want you to do that either. 
- It's cold.

756
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,186
Sit down here. It's warm down here.

757
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:21,701
Jackson, I love you. I love that you're doing this,

758
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:25,335
but I also feel like I should call the guys with butterfly nets to come get you...

759
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,593
- and me and all of us. 
- Well...

760
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:29,902
- I'm so sorry, guys. 
- For what?

761
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:31,694
For freaking out about dumb things like zucchini

762
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:35,365
and not realizing that people would respond in very loving and nutty ways.

763
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:38,316
This is not the way to do this. We're too stressed out. We're not having fun.

764
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:41,043
This whole inn experience is flying by.

765
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:43,767
- Tonight it stops. 
- Sounds good to me.

766
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:46,337
- It is nice and warm here. 
- Here's what we do.

767
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:48,667
We each have to drop something off our list -- something big --

768
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,782
and the others get to pick for the person,

769
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:53,777
and the person cannot refuse a reasonable request to drop something.

770
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:55,533
- Like a game. 
- And we all win.

771
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,756
You're dropping the pillows.

772
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:59,056
- Okay, the pillows are history. 
- Good.

773
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,881
Okay, you are dropping two desserts off the menu.

774
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:03,848
A selection of six is all people need.

775
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:05,666
- I'll second that. 
- I can live with that.

776
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:08,963
And Michel, you're no longer asking for 10 references from every person we're hiring.

777
00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:11,876
But they are all such imbeciles. How else will we know?

778
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,254
- We're capping it at three. 
- Five.

779
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:14,866
- Four. 
- I guess four's okay.

780
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:17,042
It really is comfortable here.

781
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,721
- I'm actually relieved about the pillows. 
- You'll do them later.

782
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:21,282
Are you guys seeing these stars?

783
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,494
Oh, wow, beautiful.

784
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,637
I haven't looked at the stars in ages.

785
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,751
That's another rule. We all have to look at the stars more often.

786
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:31,957
- Done. 
- I'm very comfortable.

787
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:32,731
Me too.

788
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:57,803
Tonight I got into a fight at a strip club with my nephew.

789
00:37:58,644 --> 00:37:59,241
A fight.

790
00:38:00,307 --> 00:38:02,233
I haven't been in a fight since sixth grade.

791
00:38:02,524 --> 00:38:04,516
Vince Williams called me a doodyhead.

792
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:05,948
I took it very personally.

793
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:09,989
But you know what? Tonight was good. Tonight something happened to me.

794
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,077
I achieved this great sense of calm.

795
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:16,015
No more anger, no more frustration.

796
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:19,640
Live and let live. You are who you are.

797
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:22,943
I cannot change that, and I'm gonna stop trying.

798
00:38:23,946 --> 00:38:25,027
I wish I'd felt this earlier.

799
00:38:26,108 --> 00:38:27,658
Then I wouldn't have dragged you down here.

800
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:29,194
I apologize for that.

801
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:33,147
But, I mean, if you really hate your mother that much,

802
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:38,083
then you shouldn't be here, you shouldn't walk her down the aisle,

803
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:39,313
and you shouldn't go to her wedding.

804
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,314
- I don't hate my mother. 
- You don't?

805
00:38:42,522 --> 00:38:44,779
Well, then, I don't get it.

806
00:38:44,944 --> 00:38:47,401
Why weren't you coming -- because of me? You hate me that much?

807
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:50,729
I don't hate you.

808
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:56,453
- I came here because of you. 
- Stop that.

809
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:58,046
You said it was important to you. Remember?

810
00:38:58,195 --> 00:39:00,641
- I remember. I didn't think you were listening. 
- I was listening.

811
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:02,859
So, you don't hate your mom, you don't hate me, so...

812
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:04,770
why weren't you coming?

813
00:39:07,098 --> 00:39:10,845
No. Rory still? That's ancient history. You haven't seen her in a year.

814
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,288
I saw her when I was here a few months ago.

815
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:14,896
I didn't know that. So, what happened?

816
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:18,474
Nothing. I told her...

817
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:21,162
What?

818
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:23,665
I told her I loved her.

819
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:27,624
- What did she say? 
- Nothing.

820
00:39:27,896 --> 00:39:29,411
What, you just said it and walked away?

821
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,562
No. I got in my car and left.

822
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,118
- You just dropped the bomb and ran? 
- I drove.

823
00:39:33,215 --> 00:39:34,536
You didn't want stick around to see what she said?

824
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:37,326
No. And obviously, she had nothing to say.

825
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:37,879
How do you know?

826
00:39:38,038 --> 00:39:41,770
She could have contacted me anytime in the last three months, but she didn't.

827
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:43,732
What are you talking about? You change your phone number weekly.

828
00:39:44,402 --> 00:39:48,002
- The ball was in her court. 
- Oh, Jess, come on.

829
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,076
You did this completely wrong.

830
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:56,312
Open two-way communication is the foundation of love, and you cut that off.

831
00:39:56,901 --> 00:39:59,394
I had this friend -- let's call him Phillip --

832
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:02,907
who thought expressing intimacy was a favor to his partner,

833
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:07,924
but expressions of intimacy should be given freely and frequently.

834
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,637
He loved Judy, but he used his love as a bargaining tool.

835
00:40:10,746 --> 00:40:13,448
- Who the hell is Judy? 
- Phillip's wife. We call her Judy.

836
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,318
- I wasn't bargaining. 
- You were bargaining.

837
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:18,231
You had expectations out of line with what you deserved. You don't nurture.

838
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:20,065
Where are you getting this junk?

839
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:23,428
- Life. I've lived. 
- What, in a Bette Midler movie?

840
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:25,876
- I'm just trying to help you out. 
- Oh, please.

841
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:29,040
- You are the most dysfunctional person I know. 
- Not anymore.

842
00:40:29,172 --> 00:40:31,327
Your marriage to Nicole -- nothing but weird.

843
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,098
- I'm better now. 
- Yeah, right. Right.

844
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:38,250
Oh, man. We're just a couple of losers.

845
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:40,069
Well, things change, my friend.

846
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:41,291
Oh, yeah?

847
00:40:42,735 --> 00:40:43,487
Stay tuned.

848
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:52,377
You really told her you loved her? 

849
00:41:02,676 --> 00:41:06,177
- Sook, Sook. 
- Where are we?

850
00:41:06,276 --> 00:41:07,839
Michel, wake up.

851
00:41:08,044 --> 00:41:09,702
Hon, wake up.

852
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,416
- What happened? 
- We slept with the zucchini.

853
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,361
We slept with the zucchini?

854
00:41:14,562 --> 00:41:15,641
We slept with the zucchini.

855
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:17,941
I slept good. I mean, really good.

856
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:18,703
Me too.

857
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,388
That's the best night's sleep I've had in weeks.

858
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:22,989
My back isn't hurting. It's perfect now.

859
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:24,592
It's like a magic zucchini patch.

860
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:27,209
- How are the zucchini? 
- They can't wait to be soup.

861
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:36,460
Luke, hi.

862
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:38,053
Hey. Where are you coming from?

863
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:40,316
Oh, you know, the zucchini patch.

864
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,617
It's a long story. No, it's short.

865
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:45,666
- I slept in the zucchini patch. 
- Okay.

866
00:41:47,981 --> 00:41:49,455
So, what are you doing here?

867
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,431
- Well, I wanted to talk to you. 
- Okay.

868
00:41:51,682 --> 00:41:54,318
- I got that wedding coming up, Liz's wedding. 
- I know.

869
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:58,354
I know you're busy with your to-do list and all, but I think you could use a little break.

870
00:41:58,523 --> 00:41:59,900
Oh, I could use a little break.

871
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:02,265
- Take a break with me. Come to the wedding. 
- Really?

872
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:04,278
It should be fun. There'll be turkey legs.

873
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:05,511
- Oh, well, sure. 
- Yes?

874
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,184
- Yes. 
- Good. Yes, good.

875
00:42:10,053 --> 00:42:10,790
All right, then.

876
00:42:11,286 --> 00:42:14,384
I'll meet you at your house. We'll walk over together, okay?

877
00:42:14,502 --> 00:42:15,336
- Great. 
- Okay.

878
00:42:15,685 --> 00:42:17,201
- Good. I'll see you then. 
- Or before then.

879
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:19,434
- Either way is good. 
- Yeah, me too.

880
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,256
Oh, and you don't have to wear a fruity outfit.

881
00:42:23,506 --> 00:42:25,781
- Oh, I'm gonna be a little fruity. 
- That's good, too.

882
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:45,760
What is it with you?

883
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:57,680
Here. I'm done with them. Enjoy.
