1
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:15,690
Mmm, very good. Not too spicy.

2
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:18,101
I pack it very tightly.
It strangles the spice.

3
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,352
Well, it's perfect,
and we're doing very good on time.

4
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,886
At 4:00, we move on to dumplings.

5
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:24,674
I'm going to open another window.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,247
Boy, there's a lot of activity down here.

7
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:29,546
It's going very well.

8
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:31,791
Your aunt Joon is a wizard with the kimchi.

9
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,457
Well, is there anything I can do to help?

10
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,695
No, go back upstairs.

11
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:36,687
Read the bible passages I've underlined.

12
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:43,148
Enough!

13
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,376
Back to work! Back to work, all of you!

14
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:49,008
And she will have children
in the proper time!

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,894
- You, upstairs.
- But, mama--

16
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:52,710
You come down, cooking stops. Up.

17
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,905
But it's hot up there, mama,
and you know what rises with the hot air?

18
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:58,223
The smell of 10 pounds of kimchi.
I'm getting woozy.

19
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,733
Well, pull your sweater over your face.
Just get back upstairs.

20
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:05,180
Vera Wang calling.

21
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:06,927
Wow, you can almost see that smell.

22
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:08,350
- Is that the dress?
- It is indeed.

23
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:10,862
Wonderful. Lane, the dress. Well, come on,
let's see it.

24
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,116
Okay.

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,204
Hold that thought.

26
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:16,607
You couldn't have set it on fire?

27
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:18,448
Dude, there's not enough lighter
fluid in the world.

28
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:20,307
I hope you made a matching blindfold

29
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:22,481
so Zach doesn't have to
actually see me in it.

30
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,434
Now, come on. You're gonna look beautiful.

31
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:26,480
You have a very pretty face,
and you have hands and feet.

32
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,205
For some guys,
the stuff in between is just annoying.

33
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:33,181
Mama, are you okay?

34
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:34,691
Yes, fine.

35
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,363
What are you doing here?

36
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,992
- I brought the dress.
- What dress?

37
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:40,429
My wedding dress, mama.

38
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,500
Oh, yes.

39
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,832
I was just about to show it to you.

40
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,404
Right. Go ahead.

41
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:47,047
Um, now, there were a couple of stains on it,

42
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:50,510
just probably from age,
so I had to make a few minor adjustments,

43
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,759
but I think you'll see, all in all,

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,505
that the integrity of the dress
has remained intact.

45
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:01,302
Fine. How much do I owe you?

46
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:04,809
Uh, nothing. Um, consider it a wedding gift.

47
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,798
Okay. I have to go back to work.
I will see you and Luke at the wedding.

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,604
Yes, you will. I mean, you'll see me.

49
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:11,192
Luke is out of town,
but I'm gonna take pictures

50
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:13,532
and make him feel really bad he missed it.
It's the thing we do.

51
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,285
Whatever. Goodbye.

52
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:18,688
Did she see it?

53
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,460
I held it up right in front of her face.

54
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,854
But she didn't yell. It's got a waist,
and she didn't yell.

55
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:25,942
Well, don't question it. Take the
dress upstairs and hide it till
you're walking down the aisle.

56
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:27,359
And even then, walk fast.

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,027
- Thank you.
- Okay.

58
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:32,641
Lorelai, wait! Come back!

59
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:35,030
What do you mean Luke's out of town?!

60
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:38,212
Uh, well, I mean, Luke's left town.
He's gone far away from town.

61
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:39,647
Town's there, and Luke's over here.

62
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:40,952
He's not coming to the wedding with you?

63
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:41,518
No.

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,287
You mean you're coming alone, unescorted?

65
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,311
- Well, Rory will be there.
- No, she won't like it.

66
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:48,341
You can't come alone.
An unmarried woman of a certain age,

67
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:50,360
unescorted, wearing the clothes
you tend to wear--

68
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,768
people will think things, bad things--

69
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:52,367
Like what?

70
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:54,150
Like you're a tramp and possibly for sale.

71
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,362
Wow, suddenly "Footloose"
not seeming so silly.

72
00:02:56,363 --> 00:02:57,239
What are we gonna do?

73
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,271
Well, I guess first of all,
we should agree on a price.

74
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:01,537
You have to find someone to bring you.
You have to find a man.

75
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:03,918
In one day? Are you kidding me?
It took me this long to find Luke.

76
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,632
My daughter wants you at her wedding, fine.

77
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:08,500
But if you're to come,
then you need to come with a man.

78
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,090
And Kirk does not count!

79
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:15,412
Lorelai Gilmore-- disappointing
mothers since 1968.

80
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:14,829
Phones are ringing, people. Answer them.

81
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,467
Who knows,
It could be someone calling with a story.
Wouldn't that be neat?

82
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:20,683
Aah, I thought I told her to
cut the second paragraph.

83
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:23,113
Stacy, I thought I told you,
cut the second paragraph.

84
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:24,007
I forgot.

85
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:25,290
Good work, Stacy.

86
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,039
- A.K., time?
- 3:15.

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,750
Okay, everyone,
just to remind you that I am leaving at 3:00,
which is 15 minutes ago,

88
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:33,430
so if anyone needs anything from me,
too bad till Monday.

89
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:34,738
My pro-tenure piece.

90
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:35,751
Okay, thank you.

91
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:37,407
- And my anti-tenure piece.
- Paris, come on.

92
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,782
- Just hear me out.
- No.

93
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,822
When I first started writing,
I believed passionately

94
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,540
that tenure was a reward for excellent
service and a way for a school

95
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,638
to attract the very best teachers
from all over the country.

96
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,562
Let's go with that.

97
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:49,431
But once I finished writing,
I started thinking about the
other side of the argument--

98
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:51,884
money and employment for the rest
of your life, no matter what?

99
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:53,830
Where is the incentive to
keep the standards high?

100
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,425
I mean, remember professor Leavers?

101
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:58,337
He got tenured and lost all interest.
Just sat there, dowdy and sleepy.

102
00:04:58,338 --> 00:04:59,631
It was like being taught by Jimmy Kimmel.

103
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,013
Anti-tenure-- stamp it, ship it.

104
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:02,460
I was thinking,
maybe you could print both pieces.

105
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,509
- What?
- Side-by-side, like a point/counterpoint.

106
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,886
You want me to print a point/counterpoint

107
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:07,504
where both points are written
by the same person?

108
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:08,428
Bold, huh?

109
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:10,433
You have five minutes to pick a side.
A.K., time?

110
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:11,649
3:17.

111
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,143
Ooh, how very "all the president's
men." Exciting.

112
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:17,606
Aha, just the girl we were looking for.

113
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:18,709
We have a wonderful idea.

114
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,044
- We are going to Costa Rica.
- What?

115
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:23,508
We're gonna fly out tonight and meet the guys
at the end of their river-rafting trip.

116
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,664
We thought we set up a fabulous camp,
dress up like natives--

117
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:28,010
in grass skirts and coconut
bras and meet the boys

118
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:29,927
with food, fresh booze, and shaving cream.
What do you think?

119
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:31,576
I think you should double-check
your guidebooks,

120
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,058
'cause I don't think Costa Rican natives
wear grass skirts and coconut bras.

121
00:05:35,057 --> 00:05:37,514
Oh, who cares?
There's only a small window of time

122
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:39,028
where a girl can pull off a coconut bra.

123
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,574
Well, thanks for the invite, but I can't.

124
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:41,511
What? Why?

125
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:43,668
Don't you want to see Logan after
six days without a shower?

126
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:44,496
Or styling gel?

127
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:47,138
I have a wedding to go to,
and I'm leaving in a minute to head home.

128
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,265
Logan will be very disappointed.

129
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,634
Well, I'll hide the soap and the kiehl's,
and we can re-enact it when he gets back.

130
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,633
Hmm, I'm feeling a chill from the north.

131
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,554
Okay, well, if you change your mind,
and please, change your mind,

132
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:57,809
call my cell. We leave at ten.

133
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,194
Have a safe flight.

134
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,647
Woodward, Bernstein.

135
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:05,989
Okay, and that's it. Layout's done.

136
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,500
- A.K?
- 3:20.

137
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:11,314
I'm Audi.
Jill, approve Paris' piece when it's in.

138
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:14,199
I can't pick a side. Either way I look at it,
I'm right.

139
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,868
I'll see you Monday, Paris.

140
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:21,859
You know, I hear the weather's supposed
to be beautiful tomorrow.

141
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,665
How big a wedding do you think it will be?

142
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,446
I don't know.

143
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,253
I hope it's a big wedding.
I love big weddings.

144
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,089
What time are you picking me up tomorrow?

145
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,427
- Noon.
- Oh, noon is fine.

146
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:32,754
That will give me plenty
of time to get ready.

147
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:35,140
You know,
I hope you don't stay out too late tonight.

148
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,633
You'll be tired for tomorrow.

149
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:37,717
I will not be tired.

150
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:40,021
I wouldn't drink too much,
either-- you'll be puffy.

151
00:06:40,022 --> 00:06:42,341
Okay, I'll keep it to half
a box of wine, max.

152
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:45,394
I'm just saying,
tomorrow is a very special day.

153
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:46,884
You need to be perfect.

154
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,337
Okay, I'm not getting married, Michel.

155
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:51,375
I know that, but you are going to be with me,

156
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,464
and I'm going to look fantastic,

157
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:56,880
and you know that who you are with is
always a reflection of yourself,

158
00:06:56,881 --> 00:07:00,737
and I don't want my reflection to look like
Judy Garland, the Mark Herron years.

159
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:01,767
Michel, stop.

160
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:04,487
Now, I'm going to be wearing
my blue pinstripes,

161
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:06,555
so if you wear something in an ice blue or--

162
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:11,031
Oh, yes, silver, that would look amazing.

163
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,105
No one would take their eyes off of us.

164
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:14,712
And how delighted the bride will be.

165
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:16,153
Now let's discuss dancing.

166
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:19,875
As you know,
I'm a fabulous dancer-- Deney Terrio level--

167
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,855
and I intend to dance a lot.

168
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:25,757
It's what I do at parties to compensate
for the elevated calorie intake.

169
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,012
I just shake it all off.

170
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,279
Well, I promise to duck.

171
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,691
I don't understand your attitude. After all,
these are your friends.

172
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:33,060
I don't even know them.

173
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,569
- Lorelai!
- Yeah?

174
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,383
Lorelai! Help! Lorelai...

175
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:38,929
Oh, my God. Problem.

176
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,423
- Something went very, very wrong.
- Wrong with what?

177
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:45,477
Remember the dirty cookies I was baking
for the bachelorette gift baskets?

178
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:47,635
Well, they expanded in the oven.

179
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,132
Expanded? What do you mean?

180
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,605
- Oh, dear!
- I know.

181
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:51,948
Hello, Tommy Lee.

182
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,250
I don't know what happened. Too much yeast.

183
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:56,219
Well, I cannot put those in the bags

184
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,137
with the shiny tiaras and the bubble wands.

185
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:01,529
I know, I know. I know.
I'll go try and figure something out.

186
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,635
Okay.

187
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:05,620
- Hello?
- Hey, Lor, you got a minute?

188
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,957
You see? This is what you're up against.

189
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,064
Yes, I have a minute.

190
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,733
I just got Rory one of those sidekicks.

191
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:14,352
Actually, I got it a couple of days ago,
so she already has it.

192
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:16,849
And then I realized it's one of those
things I should have run past you.

193
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,252
So I'm running it past you now. Is that okay?

194
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:21,564
'Cause if it's not, I can take it back.

195
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:25,164
I'll just say I read something in consumer
reports about radiation levels.

196
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:28,143
Chris, honey, we're way past the point
where you have to get my permission

197
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:29,937
to buy your own daughter a gift.

198
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:30,561
We are?

199
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:31,822
Yes. Didn't you get the memo?

200
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,468
Well, you know what a mess my desk is.

201
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,246
I think it's nice that you
bought Rory a gift.

202
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:35,864
Good.

203
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:38,067
- So, how are you?
- I'm great.

204
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,537
Yeah? How's G.G?

205
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:42,609
She's-- well, hold on a sec.

206
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,672
- You hear that?
- No.

207
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:47,611
- Exactly.
- Oh, come on. It's naptime.

208
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,343
Not until 4:00, my friend.

209
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,887
Then she's holding her breath
until you buy her a Porsche.

210
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:54,061
She is in her room playing with her toys,

211
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:56,055
shining her halo as we speak.

212
00:08:56,056 --> 00:08:58,207
Well, well, well,
look who's cracking the whip.

213
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,431
I got to tell you,
that "no" word is pretty awesome.

214
00:09:00,432 --> 00:09:02,874
I can't wait to try out
the "you're grounded."

215
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,228
So...

216
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,271
Anyway...

217
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:10,385
- Lane, I'm here, and I--
- Move!

218
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:13,323
- Lane, hi, I--
- Coming through!

219
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:14,596
Am I here early?

220
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,126
Sorry. Hi, glad you're here.

221
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:18,249
What's going on? And where's all your stuff?

222
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,364
My grandma's coming.

223
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:20,797
Jeez, how big is she?

224
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:23,752
She hasn't been out of Korea in 45 years
because she refuses to travel,

225
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:25,501
so we figured there's no way she'd come,

226
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,038
but she called today, and she's coming.

227
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,317
So, that's nice, right?

228
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,002
- Help me!
- Coming!

229
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,526
Whoa, big Buddha!

230
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,482
- Save the commentary. Grab the feet.
- Okay.

231
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:37,747
Be careful. Don't let it drop.

232
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:39,008
What happens if it drops?

233
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:39,888
It breaks.

234
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:41,498
Oh, you ask a stupid question...

235
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,780
Down, here.

236
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:46,786
I'll have the boys next door
bring the other one in.

237
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,575
Did you get the crucifixes
out of the kitchen?

238
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:50,404
- No.
- Go, both of you! Go! Go!

239
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:51,092
Going!

240
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:53,376
And don't forget the Christ's-feet tea towel!

241
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:56,746
Okay, seriously, you have got to fill me in,
or I got to call my life line.

242
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:57,664
What is with the Buddha?

243
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,214
Apparently my grandmother's a Buddhist.

244
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:01,395
Go hide these in your room.

245
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,479
- Closet?
- Uh, floorboards!

246
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,869
I don't understand.
So your grandma's Buddhist.

247
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,871
Why are we--

248
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:12,022
- Oh, my God. She doesn't know.
- No.

249
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:14,748
Your mother's mother does not know
she's a seventh-day Adventist.

250
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,758
And it would be a very big
deal if she found out.

251
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,664
That is so weird.

252
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:19,275
Tell me about it. I just discovered today

253
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:21,909
that I am simply the latest link
in a chain of Kim women

254
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,798
who hide their real lives under floorboards
away from their mothers.

255
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,096
- Lane, she's here!
- I want all boys!

256
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:28,439
Praise Buddha!

257
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:36,298
- That's your mom's mom?
- Yep.

258
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,609
I see the resemblance.

259
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:27,880
What was that all about?

260
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:31,050
Three complaints, two insults,
and a hefty dose of religious guilt.

261
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:32,116
What are they doing now?

262
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,983
Their ritual of 108 bows.

263
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,081
Should be called 108 "ows."

264
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,386
Oh, my mother would have liked that one.

265
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:41,301
It's kind of hypnotizing if you
stare at it long enough.

266
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,331
Oh, shoot, we have to go.

267
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:47,826
Uh, mama?

268
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:54,160
Mama, we have to go-- the bachelorette party.

269
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:56,046
We're meeting the others at Doose's.

270
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,449
80 to go.

271
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,910
Okay, so, I'll see you later. Bye.

272
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:19,600
Ladies, ladies, please,
I need your attention.
This is a very serious subject here.

273
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:22,608
Now, I need to do a quick check to make
sure we have got all of our supplies.

274
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,911
Rory, read off the list.

275
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:25,133
- Beer.
- Check.

276
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:26,429
- More beer.
- Check.

277
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,397
- Pretzels, and beer.
- Check.

278
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:32,523
Various chocolately treats, alternative
alcohol for those who
don't like beer, and beer.

279
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:33,160
Check.

280
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,377
List complete, sarge.

281
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,221
Excellent. Now we are about to commence
the first leg of our evening.

282
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:40,376
Our dear friend Lane is about to get married,

283
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:43,238
and it is our job to make sure
we give her one night

284
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,868
and one headache she will never forget.

285
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:45,735
Hear, hear!

286
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:48,108
And our first stop is the black, white,
and read bookstore,

287
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:50,819
where we will sneak in our booze, our treats,
and proceed to get drunk

288
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,105
and watch tonight's feature,
"American Gigolo."

289
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,989
Featuring a little full-frontal
from Mr. Gere himself.

290
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,472
All right, let's go to the movies!

291
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:01,103
Wait for me!

292
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,295
Sorry I'm late.

293
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:03,965
I had to wait for the two Mrs. Kims to sleep

294
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,193
before I can climb down tree to meet you.

295
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:08,682
Luckily all that bowing makes
them sleep like dogs.

296
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:10,203
It's okay, Kyon. We were just leaving.

297
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:14,633
Oh good. I had to get out of house.
Stinks of kimchi and incense.
You can't breathe.

298
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:17,806
There's Buddhas everywhere staring at you.

299
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,812
What?

300
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:23,642
When did you start double dressing
and-- Avril Lavigne?!

301
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:26,141
Avril Lavigne rocks. You are such a snob.

302
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:28,305
If it's not Joy Division, you no like it.

303
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,261
Well, you can't dance to Joy Division.

304
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,216
You're crazy! My whole family's crazy.

305
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:36,860
Well, welcome to the club.
We'll get sweatshirts.

306
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:39,921
Hmm, secret admirer?

307
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:43,334
It's dad. He gave me this thing as a gift,
you know.

308
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:45,497
However, he also got himself one,
and since then,

309
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:48,514
he has been texting me every five minutes.
It's insane.

310
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,561
You should have told him no
when he ran this past you.

311
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,025
It's nice you have a real daddy/daughter
thing going on here.

312
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:57,002
Oh, yeah,
he's shopping for celery at the supermarket.
They're running a special.

313
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,115
He's just excited.

314
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:00,761
Yeah, well,
now he's in the canned-peas aisle.

315
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:03,473
Apparently he doesn't like peas,
but he does like pea soup.

316
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,224
Interesting, no? No!

317
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:06,303
All right, give me that.

318
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:10,854
Um, okay. "Your daughter is about to see
Richard Gere's penis. Enjoy your celery."

319
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:12,803
That should shut him up for a while.

320
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,957
That's got to be some sort of record.

321
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:24,674
I don't understand.
I checked the time of the movie twice.

322
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:26,817
Well, the paper probably
printed it wrong again.

323
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:28,262
We could've just gone in.

324
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:31,353
No, too risky.
No way to know if we'd missed the money shot.

325
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:34,611
"American Gigolo" without the
"gigo-down-low" is pointless.

326
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,073
So, what should we do now?

327
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:39,174
Uh, well, we could kill some
time till the next showing.

328
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,714
Sure. That's only 45 minutes.

329
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:41,720
So, where should we go?

330
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:42,567
We could get some coffee.

331
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:43,660
"Partay."

332
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:46,913
Well, maybe we could play a game.
I do that with the kids and time flies

333
00:14:46,914 --> 00:14:49,306
I don't really think peek-a-boo's
gonna fly, Sookie.

334
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:51,696
Well, we could make it more adult, you know?

335
00:14:51,697 --> 00:14:53,273
Peek-a-boo, take a shot.

336
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:54,449
That could be fun.

337
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,403
- Hey!
- Hey!

338
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:58,189
Didn't expect to see you guys here.

339
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,672
We were gonna see "American
Gigolo," but we missed it.

340
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:02,493
I swear, I checked the time twice.

341
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:03,472
We believe you, Sookie.

342
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:04,489
What are you guys doing here?

343
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,784
We just came from Dell's bar.

344
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:08,033
It closed early 'cause it's
Dell's wedding anniversary.

345
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,828
Dell's is closed? Shoot.

346
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:11,240
We were gonna go there after the movie.

347
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,589
Well, we could go to the Chimney Sweep.

348
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,767
- No, it burnt down last week.
- Kind of ironic.

349
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:17,366
We could drive over to Beacon falls,
anything open there?

350
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:17,829
No.

351
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,235
We could go to my aunt's house.
She's got a rec room with a record player.

352
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:22,371
No way. That's completely lame.

353
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:23,850
Which one's "American Gigolo"?

354
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,765
Is that the one where you see
Richard Gere's Johnson?

355
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:27,974
'Cause that seems a little weird
for a bachelor party.

356
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:30,774
- No, we are not doing this.
- Doing what?

357
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:35,056
We are supposed to be getting wild at
separate bachelor and bachelorette parties!

358
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:37,315
We cannot be bumping into each
other all night long.

359
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:38,492
Lady's right.

360
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:42,429
Come on, men.
Let's go find something wild to do.

361
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,855
Yeah!

362
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,620
You guys, we are looking pathetic now,
all right?

363
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:49,575
We are young,
temporarily single girls on the prowl.

364
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:52,478
There's plenty to do tonight that
we can be mortified about.

365
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,139
Well, the t-shirts and tiaras are a start.

366
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,607
Exactly. All right, ladies, come on.
Let's go find us some fun.

367
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:58,931
Yeah!

368
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,393
Five more seconds.

369
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:09,885
That's it. Anyone?

370
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:10,901
- Nope.
- Nope.

371
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,124
Let's do it.

372
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,954
Hi. Are you Brian's aunt?

373
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:20,541
Oh, you must be Lane.

374
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,568
The boys are downstairs in the rec room.

375
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:23,922
Sounds like they have foosball.

376
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,311
Foosball's fun.

377
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:27,858
Bachelorettes in the house!

378
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,264
Hey, boys!

379
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:33,985
Hey, look, there's a moose head.

380
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:40,418
Dad's feet are two different sizes.

381
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:44,055
Oh, for the love of-- hey,
which one says, "hi, I'm not a whore.
Enjoy your day"?

382
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:45,464
- The pink one.
- Thanks.

383
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:47,294
Do not talk. We're going to be late.

384
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,906
I talk fast. It's my gift.

385
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:52,559
- Hello?
- I just got tickets to Céline Dion.

386
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,017
- What?
- My friend Tessa just called

387
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:59,827
and told me she has front-row tickets to
Céline Dion, and I'm going with her.

388
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:01,038
Well, that's great.

389
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,693
I have been waiting forever to
get this close to Céline.

390
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:08,247
Oh, my god, I'm shaking like a leaf.

391
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:11,238
What should I wear?
What would Céline like me in?

392
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,279
I don't know, Michel,
but I'm on my way to pick you up, so...

393
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,424
Oh, no. Don't bother.
I'm not going to the wedding.

394
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,275
What? Why not?

395
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:19,023
Because I'm going to Céline Dion-- hello!

396
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:20,825
What have I been saying to you?

397
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:22,214
No, Michel, you have to go to the wedding.

398
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,295
Sorry, I cannot.

399
00:17:23,296 --> 00:17:24,787
Well, you've already seen Céline Dion.

400
00:17:24,788 --> 00:17:27,924
Only five times, and never in the front row.

401
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:32,135
I was in the balcony with the riffraff
and the people who sneak in pot.

402
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:34,204
Michel, you have to go. I need an escort.

403
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:36,793
Find someone there-- that's why
single women go to weddings.

404
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:38,423
I am not single. I'm engaged.

405
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,780
Lorelai, I'm sorry. In the future,
I owe you some kind of a favor,

406
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:42,919
but tonight you're on your own.

407
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,228
- Michel--
- I must go.

408
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,489
I'll bring you a mouse pad. Bye-bye.

409
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:51,476
Michel is going to the Céline Dion concert.

410
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,798
- Bummer.
- What am I supposed to do now?

411
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,984
Mrs. Kim made it very clear not
to show up without a guy.

412
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:59,249
This is ridiculous. Even when I have a man,

413
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,403
I'm still the girl who doesn't have a man.

414
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:02,722
This sucks!

415
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:04,368
I've known Lane since she was a little kid.

416
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,913
She's spent more time at our
house than at her own,

417
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:10,121
and now I'm gonna miss her wedding?
Fracking Céline Dion!

418
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,996
You want me to see if dad can go with you?

419
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:12,653
What?

420
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:14,421
I've got him right here.
He's turning left on main,

421
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:17,219
and he found a buffalo-head nickel
in his glove compartment.

422
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,671
No, I don't know. It's Saturday.
I'm sure he's busy.

423
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:22,329
He just left the hardware store,
and now he's parked on the side of the road

424
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,973
trying to decide how many tacos he wants.

425
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:27,105
I vote three,
'cause two just never seems enough.

426
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,401
Okay, fine, so he's not busy,
but the wedding is starting in 45 minutes.

427
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:31,564
He can be here in 20.

428
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:32,637
Seriously?

429
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:35,463
Wow-- four tacos. Quite a man, my father.

430
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:37,775
So, what do you think?
Should I pull the trigger?

431
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:40,044
Tell him to bring me a taco.

432
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:41,349
Will do.

433
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,457
- T.P.T.D.I--
- What does that mean?

434
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,836
"Totally Psyched To Do It."

435
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,126
He's making up his own acronyms?

436
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,371
Yeah, and he just learned how
to make the happy face.

437
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:51,536
Sorry, kid, what can I say?
He was really hot in high school.

438
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:02,068
- Hey.
- Hi!

439
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:02,944
Sorry I'm late.

440
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:04,417
Forget it. I can't believe you're doing this.

441
00:19:04,418 --> 00:19:06,207
My pleasure. You look great. Do I look okay?

442
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,644
This is the jacket I had with me in the car.

443
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,698
- Yeah, you look fine.
- Hey, check it out-- buffalo-head nickel.

444
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:11,388
- Oh, great. Let's go.
- Go where?

445
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:14,103
Uh, excuse me. Hi, Mrs. Kim.

446
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:16,111
I'd like you to meet Christopher Hyden.

447
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,273
He's Rory's father and a man.

448
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:20,251
Did that really need clarification?

449
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,705
She instructed me to bring a man today.

450
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,148
I just wanted to show her that
I can take direction well.

451
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:28,702
You never know who knows Spielberg.

452
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:30,090
Why did you have to bring a man?

453
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:33,025
Because an unmarried woman, alone,
of a certain age,

454
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:37,049
dressed the way I dress apparently
is Korean for Jenna Jameson.

455
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,193
Where's Luke?

456
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:40,331
Out of town with his kid.

457
00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:43,239
Oh, well, then, lucky me.
I always wanted to meet Jenna Jameson.

458
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,261
There they are.

459
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:45,552
Yes, all nice and proper.

460
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:47,965
Hey. This is very impressive.

461
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:48,930
It's a Buddhist wedding.

462
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:49,942
Is the Dalai Lama coming?

463
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:51,111
Yes, he's having the chicken.

464
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:52,739
Oh, it must be starting.
You guys should stand over there.

465
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,040
- Okay, we wait for you.
- Did you not get it?
"He's having the chicken."

466
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,625
Dalai Lama's a vegetarian.
So he's not having the chicken.

467
00:19:57,626 --> 00:20:00,070
Sorry, should I have texted
it to you instead?

468
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:25,713
The universal sounds of family.

469
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:03,959
Go!

470
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:07,187
What the hell is happening?!

471
00:22:07,188 --> 00:22:08,173
Are there bulls coming out of there?

472
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:09,479
We would've heard the china breaking.

473
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,966
- My God!
- Why aren't you running?

474
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,250
Why should we be running?

475
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:13,723
- To get to the church.
- For what?

476
00:22:13,724 --> 00:22:15,377
- For the wedding.
- I thought this was the wedding.

477
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:17,692
This was the grandmother's wedding.
Now we do the mother's wedding.

478
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:18,669
Why do we have to run?

479
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,068
Because there's 58 seats and 62 Koreans.

480
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:22,431
Oh, boy! Go!

481
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,057
Don't slow down!

482
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:26,277
- My shoes are slippery!
- Suck it up!

483
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,187
Hey! Hi, Christopher!

484
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:29,476
Chris, you remember Sookie and Jackson?

485
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:31,472
- Yeah, nice to see you again.
- You too.

486
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:33,168
- Nice day for a wedding.
- Beautiful.

487
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:34,114
Perfect weather.

488
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:36,973
- Why are we running?
- 58 seats, 62 Koreans.

489
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:38,916
- Fight for me, baby!
- I'm on it!

490
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:41,440
What do you see? Do you see anything open?

491
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:43,388
We'll take two and two! Two and two is fine.

492
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:45,658
- We can find four together.
- I don't think we can.

493
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,321
I see something. Patty, Patty!

494
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:50,371
Oh, hi, honey. What a pretty dress.

495
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,693
Oh, the things you can pull
off with that body.

496
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:53,540
These all taken?

497
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,691
Oh, no, I just thought I'd save some in case.
Here, come sit.

498
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:59,771
It's a mad house in here.
How did you get all these seats together?

499
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:01,309
Honey, I've been here all night.

500
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,607
You're kidding. Why?

501
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:06,096
58 seats and 62 Koreans? Please.

502
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:07,471
Carrot sticks?

503
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:10,513
God, look at me. I look like a bride.

504
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,041
You are a bride.

505
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,576
I feel so weird.

506
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:14,727
I want a picture.

507
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:15,861
Of me feeling weird?

508
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,978
No, of me standing next to you
while you're feeling weird.

509
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:26,335
Everything all right?

510
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:28,324
Uh, yeah, Mrs. Kim. Everything's fine.

511
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,174
Hmm. The dress looks different.

512
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,556
Really? Does it?

513
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:33,688
Everything looks different through
the eyes of a bride.

514
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:35,327
Rory, can you excuse us a moment?

515
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:36,872
Sure. I'll be right outside.

516
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,850
Mama, is something wrong? 'Cause the dress--

517
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,653
Forget the dress. Sit down, please.

518
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:46,857
Uh... Lane, I have something very
upsetting to talk to you about.

519
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:47,803
Oh, what?

520
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:49,894
It concerns the wedding night.

521
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:50,781
Oh, boy.

522
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:52,229
Yes, "oh, boy."

523
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,018
Marriage is a job, Lane.

524
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:57,149
There are rewards that come with this job,
but there are also sacrifices.

525
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,830
There are things you're going to have to do.

526
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:00,603
- Things.
- Terrible things.

527
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:02,659
- Mama, you don't have to--
- You need to hear this.

528
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,231
You need to know what to expect.
It will start early.

529
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:07,703
- What will?
- The man's expectations.

530
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:09,610
It starts early-- at the wedding, actually.

531
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:11,882
At the wedding,
you're going to have to kiss him.

532
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:12,418
Mama--

533
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,383
You will then be expected to share a bed
tonight, and when you're in that bed,

534
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:16,914
- you're expected to--
- Mama, please.

535
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,918
You're going to have to do
it with this boy, Lane.

536
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,884
You're just going to have to do it.

537
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:24,386
Hopefully, if you're lucky like me,
you'll only have to do it once.

538
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:15,070
You know, I remember the day I met Lane.

539
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:17,251
It was Rory's first day of kindergarten,

540
00:25:17,252 --> 00:25:20,017
and she insisted on wearing my
"Chico and the Man" t-shirt,

541
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,582
which I thought would either
elicit confused shrugs

542
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:25,502
or label her as a weird '70s-sitcom kid.

543
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:28,705
And we walked in the classroom,
and Lane came running up to her

544
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:30,334
and offered to share her crayons with her.

545
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:33,208
And I was so grateful,
'cause I thought even if Lane turned out

546
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:37,363
to be a psycho, bad-seed, serial-killer kid,
at least Rory had a friend.

547
00:25:37,364 --> 00:25:39,513
Who knew it would turn out to
be a lifelong friendship?

548
00:25:39,514 --> 00:25:43,315
Well, there're young. There's plenty
of time for them to have
a stupid fight to screw it up.

549
00:25:49,223 --> 00:25:51,653
This is the first one of Rory's
friends to get married.

550
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:52,933
Yeah.

551
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,126
You know, Rory could be next.

552
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,003
Yeah.

553
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,557
That's just the way I like them-- short
and in a language I can't understand.

554
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:27,833
I thought it was beautiful.
What an elegant dress.

555
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,750
Oh, yeah, the dress did look nice, didn't it?

556
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:30,984
I'm gonna go call the babysitter.

557
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:33,182
I'll go with you.
We have this new babysitter.

558
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:37,547
She's 17, sweet as can be, perfect student,
references up the wazoo.

559
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:39,480
She seems absolutely perfect in every way.

560
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:40,767
Well, she's probably a crackhead.

561
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,472
Thank you. I'm calling right now.

562
00:26:42,473 --> 00:26:43,646
I'll go with you.

563
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:46,065
- Let's go find the bar.
- Right behind you.

564
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:49,145
It was awesome, man.
Just flowed right down to the ground.

565
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:52,456
Majorly comfortable.
There's a reason Buddhists are so peaceful.
You have to see it.

566
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:54,857
I'm just happy to have another
married guy around.

567
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:58,074
Hey, just 'cause I'm married now doesn't mean
we're gonna have any Dr. Phil moments.

568
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,640
Just wait, my friend--

569
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:02,157
wait till the first time you don't
bring home the dry cleaning.

570
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:05,194
Dude, this is my day.
Can we not talk about dry cleaning?

571
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:06,979
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

572
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,456
So this robe, it must be made of silk,
'cause it is so soft.

573
00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:11,550
Silk, huh?

574
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,175
Bet it's hand-wash only.

575
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:14,795
That definitely was not the bar.

576
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:15,844
Maybe it's over there.

577
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:17,349
No, that's the gift table.

578
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,747
Did we try behind the church?

579
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:20,854
Twice. There has to be a bar.

580
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:24,233
We called Darla, if that is her real name,
and apparently, everything's fine.

581
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:26,482
- Hey, where's the bar?
- We just wonder that ourselves.

582
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:29,840
There you guys are. I was very proud of the
lack of heckling coming from your section.

583
00:27:29,841 --> 00:27:31,729
Yeah, yeah, we're real good.
Now, where's the bar?

584
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,789
Shh! Don't say that so loud.

585
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,251
What, no, no way. No bar? Are you kidding?

586
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:37,983
- Mom.
- What, they don't have to drink it.

587
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,188
Well, if we can't drink,
might as well go get something to eat.

588
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:45,600
That food is not for you.

589
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:46,708
What?

590
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:48,935
Hold on-- is this the "not
married" thing again?

591
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,440
Did you tell them I'm engaged?

592
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:52,541
Engaged has got to be worth a sparerib.

593
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,442
What the hell are they doing?

594
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:10,065
Well, there's something you
don't see every day.

595
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,407
Wow, we just made it.

596
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:17,203
Ah, yes. They really cleaned us out.

597
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:18,587
Let's see the bag.

598
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:19,572
Nice hog.

599
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,556
I can't believe your friends
gave me all this money.

600
00:28:21,557 --> 00:28:23,978
They're good people.
They know you're a good girl.

601
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:26,051
Lester chin probably stiffed you.

602
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:26,977
That's okay.

603
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:29,240
I can take those checks home,
put them in the safe for you.

604
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,636
Sure, that'd be great.

605
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:32,748
- It was a very nice ceremony--
- It was.

606
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:34,349
- The second one.
- I know.

607
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:37,700
Thank you for doing two ceremonies.
It was very important to your grandmother.

608
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:40,508
It was fun. It made my wedding
seem a little more special.

609
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:42,497
Well, it's good you see it that way.

610
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:45,066
Well, all my guests are gone. I'm going home.

611
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:45,982
Are you sure?

612
00:28:45,983 --> 00:28:48,849
Yes, I'm very tired.
I'm going to go home and go straight to bed.

613
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,178
Okay.

614
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:52,032
I'm going to wear earplugs tonight--

615
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,673
the good ones that expand in your ears--

616
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:55,682
so I won't be able to hear anything
that might be going on

617
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:58,720
out in the street at all hours of the night.

618
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:01,095
Thank you, mama, for everything.

619
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:02,989
And look at it this way.
You're not losing a daughter.

620
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,100
You're gaining a son...
who likes to wear a dress.

621
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:09,451
He had better make you happy.

622
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:10,767
He will.

623
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:14,731
Don't let him take pictures in that thing.

624
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:23,935
We're on, boys!

625
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,576
Excuse me, where do you want it, sir?

626
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:28,582
Close, dude-- really, really close.

627
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,315
Roger, Wilco. Drop it and stack it, boys.

628
00:29:31,802 --> 00:29:34,771
Excuse me. Hold on a second.
There's something wrong with your dress here.

629
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,715
Here, let me just-- got it.

630
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:38,221
Yes!

631
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:40,039
My wife's got legs!

632
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,637
So, let's get this party started!

633
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:13,504
Two Manhattans, extra cherries.

634
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:15,584
Excuse me, Rory.

635
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:16,408
Yeah, Kirk?

636
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,080
I have to ask you something.

637
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:19,903
Do you think he's yummy enough?

638
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,614
- Who?
- Troy.

639
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,340
The bartender?

640
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:26,992
Yes. See, I put this company together
for the sole purpose

641
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:31,125
of bringing truly yummy bartenders to
the lonely women of Stars Hollow,

642
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:32,684
but they really have to be yummy.

643
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:36,477
I'm talking mouth-watering,
tasty morsels of manhood--

644
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:38,614
which, by the way,
was the original name of the business,

645
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:40,465
but it was already taken
by a firm in Woodbridge.

646
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:41,350
- Really?
- Yeah.

647
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:43,166
Now, when I first met Troy,

648
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:46,079
I thought he was the epitome of yummy,
you know?

649
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,799
But now I see him in the moonlight,
I'm not so sure.

650
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,465
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, Kirk.
I think Troy's plenty yummy.

651
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,640
- You do?
- Yeah, I really do.

652
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,860
Can I go now?

653
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:57,298
Yes, thank you. Enjoy your evening.

654
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,972
Yes, hi. Is Sookie or Jackson there?

655
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,237
No. All right.
Well, just tell them Lorelai called.

656
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:11,287
Thank you.

657
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:12,175
Well?

658
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:13,422
She didn't sound drunk at all.

659
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:15,258
But she sounded like there
was a guy there, right?

660
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:15,977
No.

661
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:17,286
What about a pimp? Did you hear a pimp?

662
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,152
Yes, I heard a pimp,
but he sounded like he had a heart of gold.

663
00:31:20,153 --> 00:31:22,365
I don't understand. She's too perfect.

664
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:23,657
- Who's too perfect?
- You are.

665
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:25,137
Ooh, extra cherries. Cheers.

666
00:31:25,138 --> 00:31:26,110
Cheers.

667
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:28,103
Rory, your father has something
he wants to tell you.

668
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:30,819
Yes, I just want to apologize
for my sidekick stalking.

669
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,865
I realize now that I have a problem.

670
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:34,814
Which is the first step to recovery.

671
00:31:34,815 --> 00:31:37,392
The second step is that he's now
given the sidekick to me.

672
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:38,706
- No.
- Yes!

673
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:39,931
That's worse.

674
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,526
"Hi, Rory. What are you doing?
What do you wearing? What are you thinking?

675
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,433
What about now? Do you miss me?
Do you think I'm pretty?

676
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:45,530
Where do babies come from?"

677
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:46,581
Thanks a lot, mister.

678
00:31:46,582 --> 00:31:48,325
- Hi.
- Hi!

679
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:49,165
Hello, there.

680
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,455
Kudos on the hot dogs, by the way.

681
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:51,376
Zach's idea.

682
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:52,795
Lane came up with the fries, though.

683
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:54,102
You're so perfect together.

684
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:55,072
You having fun?

685
00:31:55,073 --> 00:31:56,750
Yes, a little too much fun.

686
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:58,151
We actually thought we should make the rounds

687
00:31:58,152 --> 00:32:00,726
before we're too toasted
to remember who you are.

688
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:01,866
Who are you?

689
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:04,021
Zach, this is my dad, Christopher.
This is Zach.

690
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,646
Congratulations, man. Nice weddings.

691
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:06,637
Thanks, dude.

692
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:08,930
Hey, I want to take a picture of
everyone with Lane and Zach.

693
00:32:08,931 --> 00:32:10,319
Oh, God, I hate the paparazzi.

694
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,794
Come on! Get in the picture. Say "cheese."

695
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:13,984
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

696
00:32:13,985 --> 00:32:15,117
Thank you.

697
00:32:15,118 --> 00:32:18,273
Okay. We should go.
We have six more tables to hit.

698
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:21,476
If we forget to say it later,
we are really glad you came.

699
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:23,021
- Later.
- Bye.

700
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:24,342
I'm out.

701
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:25,423
Let me see the picture.

702
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:26,594
No, you'll delete it.

703
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:27,640
Not if it's good.

704
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,361
You erase every picture I take of you.

705
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:30,829
No, only the ones where I look like Rhoda.

706
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,769
- You never look like Rhoda.
- Occasionally, I look like Rhoda.

707
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,064
Fine, here.

708
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,106
Wow, you have a lot of pictures.

709
00:32:36,107 --> 00:32:37,523
I like proof, okay?

710
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,285
- Wait, go back.
- What?

711
00:32:39,286 --> 00:32:40,782
Flip back. Who's that?

712
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,780
That's me with April.

713
00:32:45,102 --> 00:32:46,606
When did you meet April?

714
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:49,910
Um, when I went to Philadelphia
for Jess' open house.

715
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:51,512
Jess? Philadelphia?

716
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:52,912
What am I missing here?

717
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:55,605
Nothing. Jess' work had an open house,
I was invited,

718
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,997
and I went,
and Luke showed up there with April.
It was a total fluke.

719
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:01,230
God, I didn't know you were seeing Jess.

720
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,296
Well, I'm not seeing him. We're just friends.

721
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:04,608
Does Logan know you went to see Jess?

722
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,676
No, Logan was in Costa Rica.

723
00:33:06,947 --> 00:33:09,037
I swear, nothing happened there.

724
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,833
Okay. Met April,
took a picture together like you're pals.

725
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:16,207
I swear, mom, it was a crazy coincidence.

726
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:19,724
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I just...
I felt so weird about it.

727
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:21,499
Oh, sure, I get it.

728
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:24,479
Look, it's not like Luke was trying
to introduce her to me.

729
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,092
I walked in, they were there.

730
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:28,381
Yeah, right. Okay, fluke.

731
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,251
Are you okay?

732
00:33:29,252 --> 00:33:30,531
I'm fine.

733
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:33,115
I'm gonna get another drink.
Do you want anything?

734
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:35,048
Okay, I'll be right back.

735
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:42,113
What's up, Stars Hollow?

736
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:44,285
Who likes my robe?

737
00:33:45,783 --> 00:33:48,776
Thanks. I'm liking it myself.

738
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:55,728
Okay, tonight is not only the night I married
the coolest girl on the planet.

739
00:33:56,086 --> 00:34:02,191
It is also the world premiere of
the newly reunited Hep Alien.

740
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:06,858
It feels great to be back.

741
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:23,005
# I thought love was only
true in fairy tales #

742
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:27,071
# Meant for someone else but not for me #

743
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:31,319
# Love was out to get me #

744
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,855
# That's the way it seemed #

745
00:34:34,211 --> 00:34:37,867
# Disappointment haunted all of my dreams #

746
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,534
# And then I saw her face #

747
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:43,392
# Now I'm a believer #

748
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:45,348
# Not a trace #

749
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:48,291
# Of doubt in my mind #

750
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:51,561
# I'm in love, ooh #

751
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:56,511
# I'm a believer,
I couldn't leave her if I tried #

752
00:34:58,254 --> 00:35:00,228
Kirk, I swear, nothing happened!

753
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:01,569
I know what I saw!

754
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,116
He put fruit in your drink-- lots of fruit!

755
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:06,511
I asked him for the fruit. I was hungry.

756
00:35:06,512 --> 00:35:08,805
Attention, partygoers and revelers,

757
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,058
as I have just recently fired
all of the yummy bartenders,

758
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:14,804
from now on, the bar is serve-yourself.

759
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:16,953
- Kirk!
- Too yummy!

760
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:18,106
Way too yummy!

761
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:21,249
Kirk, this is crazy!
Why are you acting like this?

762
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,593
Boy, I tell you, if you have to get married,
this is the way to do it.

763
00:35:24,594 --> 00:35:27,395
"Have to get married"? Oh, my,
so cynical and jaded.

764
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:29,117
Well, we can't all be cool like Zach.

765
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:30,301
I think they're really happy.

766
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:32,074
Good. That's the way it's supposed to be.

767
00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:33,418
I'm glad I came to this thing tonight.

768
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:34,349
Me too.

769
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,644
So, where's Logan?

770
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:37,779
Oh, uh, he's in Costa Rica.

771
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,457
Costa Rica? Work, play?

772
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,670
Play, always play.

773
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:41,943
Really? What's he doing?

774
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:46,286
Oh, he's gonna jump off something
and raft down somewhere,

775
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:49,354
climb up a thing, swing around on a vine,
stuff like that.

776
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,607
Listen, I want you to know that I like him.

777
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:55,971
I like him, and I like you,
and I like you and him together.

778
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:57,224
Well, good.

779
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:59,479
I just want you to know that I approve.

780
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:01,336
Dad, it's not like we're getting married.

781
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:04,164
But if that changes,
I just want you to know...

782
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:06,381
- That you approve.
- Yes.

783
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:11,337
You know,
it's been a while since I partied like this.
I used to be much better at that.

784
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:14,083
Well, maybe Logan can give you
some tips when he gets back.

785
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:23,205
Hi. I'm Brian Fuller,
bass player for Hep Alien and best man.

786
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,757
All right,
I want to say a few words about Zach.

787
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:28,984
I've known Zach for most of my life.

788
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:31,192
I've been his roommate and friend,
and I just have to say,

789
00:36:31,193 --> 00:36:35,201
I think Lane has something very,
very wrong with her.

790
00:36:36,398 --> 00:36:38,237
Time for the toast. Excuse me a minute.

791
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,595
Absolutely.

792
00:36:40,604 --> 00:36:42,000
We are doing shots.

793
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:44,347
- For 20, apparently.
- Pass the salt.

794
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:48,728
Uh, you know, I'm a respectable man, Lorelai,
an upstanding citizen-- I'm a father.

795
00:36:48,729 --> 00:36:50,757
I know. This is how you became one.

796
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:51,950
Well, you got me there.

797
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:54,344
In closing, Lane,
if you ever want to see a picture of Zach

798
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,752
trying to shove 14 ping-pong balls
in his mouth, I have it.

799
00:36:57,753 --> 00:37:01,009
To Lane and Zach,
may they stay together forever...

800
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,929
otherwise, Hep Alien is screwed.

801
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,850
- To Lane and Zach!
- To Lane and Zach!

802
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:07,359
- To Lane and Zach!
- To Lane and Zach!

803
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,132
- Great toast, Bri.
- Yes, excellent.

804
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,992
Seriously, dude, I need those pictures back.

805
00:37:13,993 --> 00:37:16,772
Hi, everyone, I'm Rory Gilmore.
I'm the maid of honor.

806
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:18,385
- To Rory!
- To Rory!

807
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:23,555
I'm not one for speeches, and I don't have
any incriminating pictures of Lane to share,

808
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:25,998
but I do have this letter.

809
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:31,540
This letter was written in
1995 by one Lane Kim.

810
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:35,727
It was slipped into my hands during a
spelling test in Miss Mellon's class.

811
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:38,685
I was so shocked by its contents that
I missed the word automobile--

812
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:41,656
o-t-t-o-mobile. That's right, Lane.
I remember.

813
00:37:41,657 --> 00:37:45,171
I will now share with you the
contents of this letter.

814
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:49,137
"Dear Rory, how was your lunch?

815
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:50,362
Mine was bad.

816
00:37:50,363 --> 00:37:51,652
Did you have ham again?

817
00:37:51,653 --> 00:37:54,989
If you did, I am sorry, but mine was worse.

818
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,507
I thought you should know
that today at recess

819
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,623
I decided that I'm going
to marry Alex Backus.

820
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:04,494
He has a very nice head, and his ears don't
stick out like Ronnione Winston's do.

821
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:07,290
I will love him forever, no matter what.

822
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,191
See you at brownies. Love, Lane."

823
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:11,970
I just thought that Zach should
know that in your heart,

824
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:16,268
he will always be second place to Alex
Backus and his well-proportioned ears.

825
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:17,199
It's true.

826
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,285
Come on, you're behind.

827
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:20,128
Oh, I'm gonna sit this one out.

828
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:21,227
Well, that's fun.

829
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:24,264
But the bottom line is, I love you, Lane.
Congratulations.

830
00:38:24,265 --> 00:38:26,668
- To the bride and groom.
- To the bride and groom!

831
00:38:26,669 --> 00:38:27,954
Bride and groom!

832
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:31,703
Where you going?

833
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:33,410
I want to give a toast.

834
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:36,311
Congratulations.

835
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:43,854
Hello.

836
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,979
Everybody, hello.

837
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:51,609
Some of you know me as Lorelai Gilmore,

838
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,858
and some of you know me as Cher.

839
00:38:55,522 --> 00:39:00,641
But either way,
I wanted to say a few words about our girl.

840
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,842
I have known Lane forever,

841
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:08,749
and I'm just so incredibly happy
that she has gotten married.

842
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:18,043
I mean, I am just so happy that
this adorable 22-year-old girl

843
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:23,133
has gotten married, because it's amazing,
you know?

844
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:25,855
It's really hard to get married.

845
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:28,454
Believe me, I should know.

846
00:39:28,455 --> 00:39:31,677
I mean, seriously, because Lane is married,

847
00:39:31,678 --> 00:39:35,004
and next thing, it'll be my daughter,

848
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:39,201
and then my granddaughter, but not me.

849
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,862
I'm not getting married.

850
00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:44,051
No, it ain't for me. It's not in the cards.

851
00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:47,311
But, hey, do you know what date
I'm not getting married?

852
00:39:47,312 --> 00:39:49,070
June 3rd.

853
00:39:49,071 --> 00:39:51,173
Do not save the date.

854
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:53,884
Do you hear me?
Do whatever you want on June 3rd,

855
00:39:53,885 --> 00:39:56,500
because there's nothing at
all happening on that day.

856
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:58,077
If there's anything you need
to book or anything,

857
00:39:58,078 --> 00:40:01,341
it's totally safe to book it on June 3rd.

858
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:05,226
So, congratulations, Lane and Zach.

859
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:07,866
Who else here had eight shots of tequila?
Anybody?

860
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:10,480
Hands... no?

861
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:13,632
Oh, my gosh, who misses the yummy bartenders?

862
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:17,043
I know, me too. They were so great.

863
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:22,052
I was gonna ask them to not work
on June 3rd on my not wedding.

864
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,143
I just thought that would be so fun.

865
00:40:24,144 --> 00:40:28,001
Hi, Chris. Hi, Rory. Hi.

866
00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:29,483
How about some coffee?

867
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:32,571
What? Okay.
Well, I guess we're going over here.

868
00:40:34,587 --> 00:40:36,547
Totally perfect wedding.

869
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,191
Get her over to the couch.

870
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,717
Man, I must say,
when your mom does something, she commits.

871
00:40:45,718 --> 00:40:47,985
Just prop her up. I'm gonna make some coffee.

872
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:51,136
Hon, if the two gallons we poured down her
throat at the wedding didn't do anything,

873
00:40:51,137 --> 00:40:53,251
I'm not sure what two more cups will.

874
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:57,131
Hey, no one knows how to wrangle the
powers of coffee like a Gilmore.

875
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:59,650
Just prop her up.
She hates to get pillow face.

876
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:01,515
Pillow face. Got it.

877
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:08,370
Hello?

878
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,694
Logan's hurt.

879
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:12,399
What? What do you mean? Is he all right?

880
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,246
I don't know. That was Colin.
And the line was bad.

881
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:18,154
Something happened on their trip. They're
airlifting him to a hospital in New York.

882
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:18,904
Oh, boy.

883
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:20,864
I got to go.
I want to be there when he arrives.

884
00:41:20,865 --> 00:41:22,414
Yes, go. I can take care of your mom.

885
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:24,432
Leave her a note that I'll call
her from the hospital.

886
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:26,563
- I will. Go.
- I'm going.

887
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:32,285
All right, Calamity Jane,
let's get you to bed.

888
00:41:34,168 --> 00:41:35,264
No.

889
00:41:35,265 --> 00:41:36,626
Yes.

890
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:52,603
Hello?

891
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:54,920
Hey.

892
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,040
What time is it?

893
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:02,677
Yeah.

894
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:06,086
I, uh... um...

895
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:09,435
No, Luke, it's fine. I'm glad you called.

896
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,504
Yep, the wedding was great.

897
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,253
She looked beautiful.
