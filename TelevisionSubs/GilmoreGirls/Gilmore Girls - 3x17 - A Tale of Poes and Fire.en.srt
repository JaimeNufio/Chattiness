1
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:06,218
Okay, let's see.

2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:09,894
Looks like Harvard definitely has the smallest class sizes.

3
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:11,779
Okay, we've got our first entry here.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,930
It's a pro for Harvard.

5
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:15,005
Whoa, those are not the final official pro/con lists.

6
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:16,003
Why? What's wrong with them?

7
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:17,482
The lines are crooked, the printing's all sloppy.

8
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,552
Harvard, Princeton and Yale cannot see them looking like that.

9
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,303
They're not going to see our pro/con lists.

10
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:23,590
What if they subpoena them?

11
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:25,060
Then I'll roll �em up in a ball and eat �em.

12
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:27,400
Oh, a big pro for Yale �

13
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:30,284
they have 1100 members of the maintenance staff.

14
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,328
Clean, clean, clean.

15
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:33,330
All three of these places probably have the same number.

16
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,726
But Yale must be crowing about it for some reason.

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,094
Princeton might only have two.

18
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:38,173
- Two? 
- Yeah.

19
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,509
You think there're a total of two guys cleaning all of Princeton?

20
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,073
Write "Princeton's stinking filthy" in big letters.

21
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:44,544
Yeah, I'm pretending to write it as we speak.

22
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:46,986
Good morning, ladies. May I interest you in a shirt?

23
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:49,424
Oh, Kirk. You're not selling your laundry again, are ya?

24
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:51,773
No, these are part of my latest money-making endeavor.

25
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:55,219
I'm going to print daily T-shirts featuring a humorous topical headline

26
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:56,582
of something I witness around town.

27
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:57,319
Neat.

28
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,997
I got the idea when I read about something a man was doing in Portland.

29
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:00,790
What was he doing?

30
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:03,498
He was printing daily T-shirts featuring a humorous topical headline

31
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:04,764
of something he witnessed around town.

32
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:06,355
- Is that today's? 
- Sure is.

33
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,008
"Babette ate oatmeal."

34
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:12,296
- I'm keeping it real. 
- It's good.

35
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:13,258
It paints a picture.

36
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:15,607
I can just see her... eating oatmeal.

37
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,907
They're $14.95. How many can I put you down for?

38
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:19,034
No solicitors, Kirk.

39
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:20,765
How about if I cut you in for a piece of the action?

40
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:22,470
How about I toss the shirts out the door first

41
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:23,688
so you can have something to land on?

42
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:24,472
Got it.

43
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:27,360
What's with the lists?

44
00:01:27,743 --> 00:01:30,769
You ready? My Rory, our Rory, Stars Hollow's Rory...

45
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:32,705
got into Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.

46
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:35,567
Wow, I can't believe it.

47
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:37,252
I feel like I...

48
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:45,373
Oh, I'm not good at hugging.

49
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:47,094
Oh, I thought it worked.

50
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,635
Thanks. Man, this is big, right?

51
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:49,612
Very big.

52
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:50,975
But what's with all the pro/con lists?

53
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,120
That's how we make our important decisions, you know that.

54
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:54,785
But you know what it's gonna be, Harvard.

55
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,740
- Probably. 
- But not necessarily.

56
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:58,221
But Harvard's all you've talked about for years.

57
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,284
Who knew she'd be wanted by everyone?

58
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:02,701
Hey, which school best teaches how to make an important life decision

59
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:04,176
without doing a stupid pro/con list?

60
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:06,314
Whichever one it is, add it to the pro column.

61
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:08,778
Do not mock the sciencificity of our selection process.

62
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:09,828
I've gotta head to school.

63
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:11,604
Hey, why go anymore? You're in college.

64
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:13,689
- Let's go truffle hunting or something. 
- Maybe after I graduate.

65
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:16,925
All right, but if all the good truffles are gone, don't say I didn't warn you.

66
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:17,646
Bye.

67
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:20,873
I can't believe how great that is, all three.

68
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,275
They have good taste.

69
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,456
Well... you know, Jess also...

70
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,529
It's so tiny compared to this, it's gonna sound dumb.

71
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:28,522
What? Tell me.

72
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,612
You know how Jess works at Wal-Mart.

73
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:31,389
Yes, I do.

74
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:33,407
It seems he was actually chosen

75
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,203
- Employee of the Month. 
- Really?

76
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:37,355
I knew it would sound tiny.

77
00:02:37,484 --> 00:02:40,475
No, Luke, that's not tiny. That's really good.

78
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:42,531
Yeah. I mean, there's probably hundreds of people

79
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,072
working at that branch, and they singled him out.

80
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:48,267
Yeah, it shows he can work hard and get along with people and all that.

81
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:50,325
You should be proud. Did you tell him you're proud?

82
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,656
he didn't even tell me about it.

83
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:54,555
I got a letter addressed to the family of Jess Mariano

84
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,130
inviting me down to some little ceremony they're having.

85
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,849
- Are you going? 
- Oh, he'd hate it if I was there.

86
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:02,641
You know, seeing him participating in some corporate ceremony like that,

87
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,404
being called upstanding and responsible, it would kill him.

88
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,365
- Yeah, I'm going. 
- Good boy.

89
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:08,879
Hey Sookie, Sookie... where's Sookie?

90
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:09,741
Down here.

91
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:11,680
- Down where? Marco? 
- Polo.

92
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:14,154
Why are you down there?

93
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,867
Papaya won't eat, so I'm pretending to eat out of her bowl

94
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:19,008
so she'll copy me.

95
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,278
Sookie, you named the cat?

96
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,499
She looks like a Papaya, doesn't she?

97
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:23,862
But it's a stray.

98
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,524
You'll get close to it and it'll wander off and you'll be sad.

99
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,908
I'm keeping my distance.

100
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:30,293
Come on, Papaya. Lap, lap...

101
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:33,058
All right, we're getting you up here. Come on.

102
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:36,986
Oh boy, being a cat is hard on the knees.

103
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:38,126
Since when are you a cat person?

104
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,376
Ever since I got pregnant,

105
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:41,548
I've become very nurturing toward all living things.

106
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:42,556
Jackson, too.

107
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:43,821
Both your bodies are changing.

108
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:46,339
Yesterday... it was awful.

109
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,377
Jackson moved a table and just kind of nicked this spider.

110
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,111
He didn't see the little thing, and just clipped one of its legs.

111
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:55,326
And it was having trouble walking and we were so upset,

112
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,471
but Jackson made a new leg for it out of a paper clip,

113
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,927
but jamming the clip into the spider killed it instantly.

114
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,111
Little Satchmo.

115
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:03,334
You named the spider Satchmo?

116
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:04,435
After Jackson's uncle.

117
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:05,766
I'm sure he'll be very touched.

118
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,117
- Maybe if I wore ears! 
- What?

119
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:13,145
Papaya! Look at Mommy, l

120
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:15,823
Look at Mommy, look at Mommy.

121
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:21,440
Oh, is this everyone from the Edgar Allen Poe Society?

122
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:23,115
If you mean the I-should-be-sterilized-

123
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:25,239
so-that-my-disturbing-idiosyncrasies-aren't-passed-

124
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:26,954
onto-the-next-generation society,

125
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:28,341
then yes, that's them.

126
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:30,011
Hi, welcome to the Independence Inn.

127
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,305
Thank you. We're Jim and Milly Hatlestad.

128
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:36,034
Okay, I've got you right here.

129
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:38,040
Once again, welcome,

130
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,174
and let me assure you there are no human body parts

131
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:44,138
buried in the floor of your room to keep you awake tonight. Sound good?

132
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,525
I guess.

133
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,153
Room 8.

134
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,385
The Tell-Tale Heart. That's a Poe story. Did they not get that?

135
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:55,357
The Hatlestads are not with the Poe Society.

136
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:56,867
Why didn't you tell me that?

137
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:58,822
If I had thought to, I still would not have.

138
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,756
Hi, my name is Larson, I'm checking in.

139
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,856
- Poe Society, right? 
- That's me.

140
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,314
Good. Well, welcome to the Independence Inn.

141
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,436
There will be a complimentary cask of amontillado on the table in your room,

142
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:13,390
and if you're expecting your friends Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether,

143
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:14,792
I'll send up another one.

144
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,850
You said you were with the Poe Society.

145
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,899
Yeah, but it's just a hobby.

146
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,515
- We're not Trekkies. 
- No, no, I didn't mean to imply...

147
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,417
I mean, you're not freaks, no way. Here, room six.

148
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:26,340
Thank you.

149
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,776
You might want to stop trying to cute things up.

150
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:31,188
I hear that.

151
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:33,554
Hello sir.

152
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,087
Hello everybody. Hope you're having a good day today.

153
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,314
You folks know we do this every month,

154
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,755
just a little get together to honor our new Employee of the Month.

155
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,668
Nothing fancy, just a quick �thanks' and a �way to go.'

156
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,030
Oh, and there's two hundred bucks in it.

157
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,840
I think that's how we got our honoree to even show up to this thing.

158
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:54,441
You know him as a trooper, our Mr. Reliable.

159
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,846
The first time this young man sat down on that forklift,

160
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,591
well, it was like an extension of himself.

161
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,835
And yeah, he's not one for small talk,

162
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,638
but this boy's production is out of sight.

163
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:04,194
It's Jess Mariano everybody.

164
00:07:07,231 --> 00:07:08,486
Would you like to say anything Jess?

165
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:09,600
Nope.

166
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:11,091
That's our Jess.

167
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:14,230
Give him another hand folks, and have a good one.

168
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:18,188
What are you doing here?

169
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:20,523
- I'm so proud of my boy. 
- Stop it.

170
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:22,991
Do you have a tissue because I think I'm gonna be emotional.

171
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:24,388
I mean it, stop, now.

172
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:26,611
It came with cash, it's the only reason I'm here.

173
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,604
Don't forget the plaque.

174
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:30,538
You should hang that over your bed, shine a little spotlight over it.

175
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,787
I gotta get back to work.

176
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:34,328
Yeah, the forklift's going �where's the extension of me?'

177
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,584
Hey. Saw you jawboning with our boy there.

178
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:39,881
- I'm Bill Borden. 
- Luke Danes, I'm Jess' uncle.

179
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,797
- Nice meeting you. 
- Yeah, so he's doing good, huh?

180
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:44,019
Wish I had a dozen more Jesses. He's my go-to guy.

181
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:44,911
That's great to hear.

182
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:46,955
Works like a dog on his regular shift,

183
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,294
and if someone calls in sick � and they always do �

184
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:52,074
Jess is there even if he's already done forty hours that week.

185
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,181
Wow, I am so... forty hours? He never works forty hours.

186
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,220
More like forty-five, that's what I'm saying. Good boy, that one.

187
00:07:57,328 --> 00:08:00,384
Wait, how is that possible? He's got school, he works for me, it can't be forty.

188
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:02,837
Well, I can't say I sign every time card,

189
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,076
but I'm pretty sure it's at least that.

190
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:06,338
- Maybe I'm mistaken. 
- Yeah, maybe.

191
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:08,946
Oh, thought you might like this. A little keepsake for ya.

192
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:09,923
Great, thanks.

193
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:19,396
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,

194
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:23,692
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,

195
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:27,958
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said,

196
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:30,265
"art sure no craven."

197
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:32,003
That Poe was downright funalicious.

198
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,708
He was a troubled man.

199
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:37,344
He enjoyed a little bit too much of the hmm-hmm.

200
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:39,433
Mime?

201
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,937
You know what I meant.

202
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,761
Oh, mime. That reminds me �

203
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,480
Yale, best drama school bar none.

204
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:46,678
Put that in the pro column.

205
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:47,952
I'm not taking drama.

206
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,764
No, but it means you'll have the best on-campus productions.

207
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,703
You'll get to see the next Meryl Streep all goofy and eighteen

208
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,924
and doing crap like, "Hey, name an occupation!"

209
00:08:57,073 --> 00:09:00,119
"Plumber!" "Name a farm tool now!"

210
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:03,804
"Tractor!" "Hey, I'm a tractor doing... plumbing."

211
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,212
That's what the do at the Yale drama school?

212
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,445
So I've heard. Oh, that's weird.

213
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,464
- What? 
- Over there.

214
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:13,328
- A second Poe? 
- It's like a Poe story in itself.

215
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:15,555
- The Case of the Two Poes. 
- The Messrs Poe and Poe.

216
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:16,467
Oh, that's good.

217
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,524
Oh, hey, there's Dean. Hey, is that...

218
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,794
That's Lindsay.

219
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:27,338
Oh, I think she's ready to go to the ghetto on you.

220
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,150
Well, I don't have a problem with her.

221
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,779
She's really nice.

222
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,248
And, you know, once she...

223
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,853
Bought you a magnet shaped like Mark Twain's head?

224
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:37,374
Yes, I've heard the anecdote.

225
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,341
Sorry.

226
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:40,145
I think she should just mellow.

227
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,321
I mean, you've both moved on. What's the problem?

228
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,571
But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust,

229
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:48,859
spoke only that one word...

230
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,425
I don't remember The Raven being this long.

231
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,829
It could've used some editing.

232
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,702
Oh, hey, did you put drama school on the Yale pro list?

233
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,192
- Nope. 
- Come on, do it, we'll forget.

234
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,301
- I don't have a pen. 
- Aw, jeez.

235
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:02,182
- Hey, psst. Hi, Nicole. 
- Hi, Lorelai.

236
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:03,991
Hey, how long is this thing?

237
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,541
He's got at least five nevermores to go.

238
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:06,664
Ah, jeez.

239
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:07,968
- Do you got a pen? 
- No.

240
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:10,273
- Come on, cough it up. 
- I don't have a pen.

241
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,592
You've got a restaurant. Where's the pen you take orders with?

242
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:15,690
I wasn't anticipating taking orders at the Poe reading.

243
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,795
There goes your Boy Scout badge.

244
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:18,634
Mom.

245
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:24,952
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy...

246
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:26,192
Busted by a Poe.

247
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,892
Hope he doesn't put a curse on us.

248
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:31,553
Or complain when he goes back to being Fred Larson, Tampa dentist.

249
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:32,378
Hey, Lorelai.

250
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,142
Oh, you're an angel, thanks.

251
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,088
- I'll need it back. 
- Yeah, sure.

252
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,831
Looks like Nicole's got a little Lindsay attitude going.

253
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:42,301
Not really. Really?

254
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:46,371
Hey, how many nevermores do you think he's got to go?

255
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:47,570
We're guessing four.

256
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:51,681
Poor Edgar Allen Poe, he suffered so much.

257
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,672
And now we gotta suffer along with him.

258
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:55,916
Yale drama, got it.

259
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:59,570
Rory, why do you waste your time on those pro/con lists?

260
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,004
It's going to be Harvard, we all know it.

261
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:03,857
- I know. 
- If the list says it is.

262
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:04,881
Right.

263
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:07,590
When you were six and took my cheerleading class,

264
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:10,888
you wouldn't even cheer for any other school than Harvard.

265
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:13,325
That's true. That is true.

266
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,639
Then the list will reflect it.

267
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:17,656
And my soul from out that shadow

268
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:19,694
that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted...

269
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,855
nevermore.

270
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:25,732
- Excellent. Bravo, bravo. 
- Very nice.

271
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:28,014
That was wonderful, wasn't it?

272
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,138
Thank you very much for that rendition.

273
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:32,397
Thank you.

274
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,731
What's with the Poes?

275
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:37,486
They look upset.

276
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,387
- Wanna hear the scoop? 
- Please.

277
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:40,888
I was here when they both arrived.

278
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,351
They got their signals crossed.

279
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,394
They were supposed to perform different things,

280
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,775
they both came to do The Raven.

281
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:48,475
If the Poes start fighting,

282
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:50,411
does that punch a hole in the space/time continuum?

283
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,099
And throw us into a universe where everything

284
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,964
is the exact opposite of what it is here?

285
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,838
Cool. There'll be funny sitcoms there.

286
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:58,070
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special treat for you.

287
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:02,884
It'll allow you to compare and contrast interpretations of Poe's most famous work.

288
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:03,621
Oh no.

289
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:05,716
- Compare and contrast? 
- That can only mean...

290
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:09,432
Please enjoy this second recitation of The Raven.

291
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,224
- Do we bolt? 
- Do we dare?

292
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,123
At least if I'd brought a flask, we could've played the nevermore drinking game.

293
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:19,561
Oh, maybe this is what drove Poe to the bottle.

294
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:20,441
His own work.

295
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:22,244
Once upon a midnight dreary

296
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:24,630
while I pondered weak and weary,

297
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:27,562
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,

298
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:30,006
while I nodded, nearly napping...

299
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,434
Weird vibe in here.

300
00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:34,224
- Very Poe. 
- Very Poe.

301
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,366
Well, that was pretty good.

302
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:42,068
Oh, come on. You can't do that thing where you complain,

303
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:44,988
then when you walk out you reassess based on the relief you're feeling that it's over.

304
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:47,347
I was able to compare and contrast between readings.

305
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,253
I was able to nap for twenty minutes.

306
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,971
- Good evening, ladies. 
- Oh, hi Poe.

307
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:53,179
- Good job in there. 
- I thank you.

308
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,078
Young miss, do correct me, but I heard tell

309
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,402
that you are considering attending Harvard University.

310
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:01,152
- I am. 
- I myself attended West Point.

311
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:05,955
I'm embarrassed to say that I was court-martialed in 1832 and forced to leave.

312
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,948
Excuse me, but I was expelled from West Point in 1831, not 1832.

313
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,845
No, I do believe it was 1832. It was an election year.

314
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,093
It was not an election year.

315
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:17,803
President Jackson was to serve five more years

316
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:20,409
I'm sure it was '32. I'm sad to say

317
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:23,082
it was the same year my older brother William passed away.

318
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:24,930
Okay, that's not right either, Fred.

319
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,297
Fred? I don't know this Fred you speak of.

320
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:29,426
Oh, knock it off. I'm tired.

321
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,240
- Will you excuse me? 
- Yeah.

322
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:34,889
Poes are very testy people.

323
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:37,357
I've got your latest topical T-shirts here, people.

324
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,102
Brand new topical T-shirts for sale.

325
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:40,251
What's this one say?

326
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:43,128
- "Faux Poes foes." 
- Very clever, Kirk.

327
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:44,408
It was an inspiration.

328
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:47,471
But they're not selling much better than the "Babette ate oatmeal" shirts.

329
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,806
Keep the dream, Kirk.

330
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:49,820
Hey guys.

331
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,226
Oh, hi. Mom, this is Lindsay.

332
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:55,243
The Mark Twain magnet-head girl!

333
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:56,200
The what?

334
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:57,767
You don't know the anecdote? You're the star.

335
00:13:57,982 --> 00:14:00,200
- The anecdote? 
- It's nothing, really.

336
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:05,530
It's the field trip we took to Mark Twain's house in the fourth grade,

337
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:08,545
and I wanted this magnet and you lent me the money and I got the magnet.

338
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,521
She usually tells it better.

339
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,098
I kinda remember.

340
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,247
So, congratulations on Harvard.

341
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:17,515
Oh, yeah, thanks.

342
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,605
I got into Southern Connecticut State.

343
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,268
- Oh, that's great. 
- It is. That's great, Dean.

344
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:24,095
You're... wow.

345
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:26,508
- Yeah, thanks. 
- I've gotta get home.

346
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,858
And I gotta take her, so I'll see you guys.

347
00:14:29,006 --> 00:14:30,040
- See ya. 
- Bye.

348
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,425
So you say she was nice?

349
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:35,377
Was, I guess, being the operative word.

350
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:36,882
So are we going?

351
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,053
No, you go on ahead, I'll catch up.

352
00:14:39,242 --> 00:14:41,132
Okay. Try and make it home in time for Charlie Rose.

353
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,082
Billy Joel's on, and he might cry or something.

354
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:48,161
So, how was Jess' Employee of the Month thing?

355
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:49,564
- Oh, it was okay. 
- Just okay?

356
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:51,403
- There was punch. 
- So the punch wasn't good?

357
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:53,977
No, it was just... the manager came up afterwards

358
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:55,724
when Jess was gone and he was talking about

359
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:58,183
how Jess is working forty, forty-five hours a week.

360
00:14:58,367 --> 00:14:59,963
- What? That's full time. 
- That's what I said.

361
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:01,429
How does he swing it?

362
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:04,542
He must be pulling double shifts on the weekends. It's all I can think of.

363
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,368
No, he's pretty much duding it with Rory on the weekends.

364
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:09,370
Then he must be getting up super early on weekday mornings and going in.

365
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:10,614
Have you ever seen him do that?

366
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:11,889
No, but I don't trail him either.

367
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,074
Yeah, but you sleep in the same room with him.

368
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:16,585
Oh, the manager must be getting Jess confused with somebody else.

369
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:18,570
- Or... 
- Or what?

370
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:21,219
- I don't wanna say, forget it. 
- No, say it, go ahead.

371
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,994
Or he's working when he should be in school.

372
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,861
- Impossible, no way. 
- Why?

373
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:29,375
Because he knows the rules � he's gotta graduate to stay living with me.

374
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:32,381
He's going, he's getting everything done, he's doing his work.

375
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:34,044
You've seen this work he's doing?

376
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:36,773
Not for awhile, but I just know that he is.

377
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:41,186
No, no way he's cutting school, it's suicide, no way.

378
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:42,774
- I shouldn't have brought it up. 
- Ah, that's okay.

379
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,144
- Okay. 
- Goodnight.

380
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:49,410
Say, how can I have a career as a Poe?

381
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:52,641
It's not a career, this is just an event that we do.

382
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,136
I write technical manuals for a living.

383
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:58,955
Yes, but how can I have a career as a Poe?

384
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,033
Mom. Mom, wake up.

385
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:09,062
What?

386
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,044
Mom, it's Tobin at the inn, something's wrong.

387
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:11,883
What's wrong?

388
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,297
The fire alarm's going off.

389
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:16,399
That stupid alarm. It's always doing that.

390
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:19,676
Tell him if he doesn't smell smoke, to reset it, and tell him he's fired

391
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:22,037
and I'm gonna kick his ass around the lobby for waking me up.

392
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:23,060
He sounds freaked.

393
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:27,490
Tobin, what?

394
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,087
Oh my God...

395
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:32,893
Okay. Get dressed.

396
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,309
- What is it? 
- Get dressed, get dressed.

397
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:42,088
We've got the first engine laddering the roof,

398
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:45,523
first engine. Yeah, and we need PD for traffic control.

399
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:48,872
- Ah, Lorelai, thank God. 
- Hey, what's going on?

400
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,491
- This is Lorelai Gilmore. 
- What's going on?

401
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:52,657
- In a minute, ma'am. 
- Yeah, Mom, let him do his thing.

402
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:55,765
You're right. Sookie, Michel, is everyone out?

403
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:56,731
- Yes. 
- Are you sure?

404
00:16:56,865 --> 00:16:57,977
- Yes. 
- Yes. We're sure,

405
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,814
the fire department's sure, we did a head count.

406
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:01,688
We need to double check, triple check.

407
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:05,330
Julio! He doesn't start �til six but sometimes he comes here early

408
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:08,350
because his sister-in-law Rita gives him a ride on her way to work in Salisbury.

409
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:13,244
Ah, Julio. Ah, I'm so glad to see you, you beautiful man.

410
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:18,621
- Ma'am, I'm Chief Baker. 
- Oh, I'm sorry I jumped on ya.

411
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:21,259
That's okay. The good news is that this is almost out.

412
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,505
The structure's stable, and you're probably gonna be able

413
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:26,517
to get back in in about 24 hours.

414
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:30,015
Excellent. Twenty-four hours, the structure's stable, thank you.

415
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:30,875
That's okay.

416
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,313
The statue of you is going up just as soon as we get back in.

417
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,919
- Eighty feet tall. 
- I'm looking forward to it.

418
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,504
- Here we go guys, phase two. 
- Loving the pace here.

419
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:40,941
We need food, we need computers with Internet,

420
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:42,938
we need phones. Michel, I need this on you stat.

421
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:43,891
Hurry, hurry.

422
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:45,657
- Rory? 
- Yeah?

423
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:48,698
Help the guests with the kids, make sure they're not freaked out.

424
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,454
Gather them up and entertain them for awhile so the adults can catch their breath.

425
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:54,618
Right. I have never entertained kids � how do I do that?

426
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:57,220
Take your socks off and do a puppet show.

427
00:17:57,353 --> 00:17:58,781
You've clearly never entertained kids either.

428
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,128
It's all I can think of. Get cracking.

429
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,096
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:03,502
Hi everybody. Good morning, and whoa,

431
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:04,920
talk about your change of plans here.

432
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:08,616
Unfortunately, you can't get your stuff out for at least a day.

433
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:11,172
However, if you wanna get home immediately,

434
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,896
we will check planes, trains, whatever you need.

435
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:16,364
We will send your stuff to you later as soon as we get it.

436
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:21,197
But if you can't get home yet, we will provide everything short of anything illegal,

437
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:25,028
and that's gonna start with the best breakfast of your lives.

438
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,584
Sookie, go to the market and get whatever food and supplies we need for breakfast.

439
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:31,361
Going.

440
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:37,843
- Hey, who are you on with? 
- The Cheshire Cat Inn.

441
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,838
Ah, great, find people places to sleep. Excellent.

442
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:45,661
Yes, my name is Michel Gerard, I used to work at the Independence Inn

443
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:48,663
and I was wondering if there were any positions available.

444
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:53,199
Phones, computer, I'm on it.

445
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:59,005
- Morning. 
- What, what is this?

446
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,260
- Phase two. 
- Phase two?

447
00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:01,775
Into the back, guys. March!

448
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,178
Hold on, those guys can't go back there.

449
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:05,913
Oh, we're in luck, lots of empty tables. Go on and take your seats, guys.

450
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,265
- Lorelai, what is this? 
- We had a fire.

451
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:08,689
- Fire, where? 
- Weston's Bakery.

452
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,583
- You're kidding. 
- They'll have fresh blueberries.

453
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:12,174
Perfect. Weston's, hurry.

454
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,373
Where... Weston's caught fire?

455
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:14,884
- No, the inn. 
- Your inn?

456
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,337
Just move all of Luke's stuff aside, we don't need it.

457
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:18,217
Hey, wait a minute.

458
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:20,261
Everyone's fine, the inn's still standing, we're into phase two.

459
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:22,559
- What is phase two? 
- Just shove it aside.

460
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,156
- What are you doing? 
- Making breakfast.

461
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,817
You can't make breakfast here.

462
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,353
Got any plates that aren't cracked?

463
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:28,535
You're the one that's cracked.

464
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,993
Nice thing to say to a pregnant woman.

465
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:31,535
You're pregnant?

466
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,688
Could you be any farther behind?

467
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:35,820
Yo, Caesar, help my guys and there's a twenty in it for you.

468
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:37,941
We both can't be making different stuff at the same time.

469
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:38,817
You know, you're right.

470
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:40,891
Listen, all you people who were here before we invaded,

471
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:42,528
are you willing to cancel your current orders

472
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:45,023
for Sookie's famous blueberry-lemon pancakes,

473
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:46,818
Belgian waffles or bananas foster?

474
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:48,248
- Sure. 
- Sounds good.

475
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:50,983
Okay, pull all of Luke's stuff off the grill and let's get cooking!

476
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:51,868
I'm an island.

477
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:53,220
Luke, I'm sorry about all this,

478
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,811
but I'm not anticipating the inn catching fire ever again,

479
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:57,582
so it's a one time only thing, okay?

480
00:19:57,936 --> 00:19:59,548
- Like I have a choice? 
- You do.

481
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,911
Say the word and we go.

482
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:02,851
Stay, cook, eat. I'll be upstairs.

483
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:03,794
You're a doll.

484
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,838
No, get rid of it! Dump it, dump it! I don't wanna see it!

485
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:13,128
"Where are you going? I told you to take out the garbage!"

486
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:16,824
"Nag, nag, nag. I wanna watch football and sit in my reclining chair."

487
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,744
"Get back here or I'm gonna get you..."

488
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:20,552
Oh, hey, guys, hold on a second.

489
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:21,607
No, keep going.

490
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:23,742
Oh, calm down there, little scooter. I'll be right back.

491
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,401
Hey Shari Lewis, how's the show going?

492
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:26,814
- Oh, they're riveted. 
- Good.

493
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,559
Yeah, but I stink. I keep repeating the same stuff over and over again.

494
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,362
Must be working.

495
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:32,319
But I named them Mr. and Mrs. Sock Puppet.

496
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:34,613
- I put no energy into this. 
- Come back, Rory.

497
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:37,126
You would think that a lame-o sock puppet show would bore them to tears.

498
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:39,477
It's your narrative skills. I mean, is he gonna take the garbage out,

499
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:41,464
is he not gonna take the garbage out? I'm on the edge of my seat.

500
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:43,706
Yeah, but they won't let me stop and I have to get to school eventually.

501
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:47,270
Okay. Hey, guys, go on over to the diner

502
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,205
and have breakfast with your families,

503
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:52,252
and then ask the nice man in the baseball hat

504
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:54,381
and the flannel shirt to do sock puppets for you.

505
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:57,198
And if he says no, just ask him louder � it's part of the game!

506
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:58,939
- Oh boy! 
- Go!

507
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,325
You're cruel and they love you.

508
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:01,828
Come check in at Patty's with me.

509
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:05,421
I love computers, I just know nothing about �em.

510
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:08,113
What does pushing that F3 button do?

511
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:09,783
Annoy me to no end.

512
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:11,152
What about the F4?

513
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:15,969
Hello, this is the Independence Inn emergency headquarters.

514
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,975
I'm Miss patty, I'll be assisting you today.

515
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,183
How may I help you?

516
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:23,788
The printer will be here in half an hour, I'll let him know.

517
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:26,728
Thank you. Goodbye. The printer will...

518
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:29,185
I heard, and you've got to shorten your greeting.

519
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:30,019
What?

520
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:31,802
You do not need to recite the Gettysburg Address

521
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:33,348
every time you answer the phone.

522
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:36,123
I was Ricardo Montalban's receptionist for six months

523
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:38,196
- and he never complained. 
- Who?

524
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,024
Don't make me hit you.

525
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,253
You all set up here?

526
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:44,556
Computer with Internet, phones forwarded here, printer on the way.

527
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:47,531
- I'm the receptionist. 
- And I'm learning the computer.

528
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:50,593
And I'm looking for my cyanide capsule � have you seen it?

529
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:52,180
It's nice of you to help guys, thanks.

530
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,183
Now, at least half the Poe group needs to stay another night,

531
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:55,559
so we're gonna need to find places to put them up.

532
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:57,243
Everything is booked.

533
00:21:57,424 --> 00:21:59,773
You checked the Cheshire Cat, the Maiden's Teacup,

534
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,551
the Cookie House, the Sugarbear Inn?

535
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,555
Every place that sounds like Glinda the Good Witch threw up, yes � all booked.

536
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:07,306
Then, we're gonna have to take people in.

537
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:09,338
I can take a couple in, sweetie.

538
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,564
I can, too. We got cots. Ooh-hoo-hoo, we got cots.

539
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:14,259
- Great. Michel? 
- Forget it.

540
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,050
The Poes are weird. I'd fear being killed in my sleep.

541
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:19,497
Plus, I don't like strangers using my toilet.

542
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,148
I bet the Kims could put people up. And Taylor. And Al.

543
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,052
And we've got our couch and my room.

544
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:25,783
Nope.

545
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:26,240
What?

546
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:27,357
They can have my room, not yours.

547
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:29,441
- No, hon, mine's fine. 
- Mom, no, mine.

548
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,550
You are stressed out enough without losing your room.

549
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:34,146
You need your rest, so you keep your bed, period.

550
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:34,991
I'll look selfish.

551
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:37,146
If anyone calls you that, I'll kick their sorry butts.

552
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:38,735
Okay, your room under protest.

553
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:41,868
Hey Michel, I just hit F4

554
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:45,192
and the num lock key and the one with the little apple on it

555
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,223
and it's freaking out like it's on acid or something.

556
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:49,558
Oy vey.

557
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:51,202
I got it.

558
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:52,498
Yeah?

559
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,873
You need to say more than that.

560
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:56,354
Make up your mind.

561
00:22:56,461 --> 00:22:58,807
I've gotta go, but page me if there's any news or anything.

562
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:00,731
Okay. You mean, like if Michel kills Babette

563
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:03,067
and then Patty then himself in a bizarre murder-murder-suicide pact?

564
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:04,030
Amongst other things.

565
00:23:08,084 --> 00:23:09,666
- We had a fire. 
- I know.

566
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:13,182
Bye.

567
00:23:15,108 --> 00:23:17,938
It'll be the last midterm of your high school careers,

568
00:23:17,994 --> 00:23:19,593
so rejoice over that if nothing else.

569
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:22,660
Now, before you go, I just wanna mention that it looks

570
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:25,967
like another banner year for Chilton grads seeking top colleges.

571
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:28,434
I wanna congratulate all of those who have heard

572
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:31,186
and advise patience for all of you who have not.

573
00:23:31,216 --> 00:23:34,328
No one has escaped from Chilton without going onto another terrific school

574
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,900
if that is his or her goal.

575
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:36,607
Good to hear.

576
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,342
And I know that at least one of you has been accepted to Harvard.

577
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:42,230
It's an immense honor, that. Congratulations.

578
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:45,665
Have you guys heard from Paris?

579
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:46,544
- Heard what? 
- Anything?

580
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:47,508
She's not here?

581
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:48,938
She's been gone for five days.

582
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:50,754
Didn't notice.

583
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,790
Although, it did seem like there was a lot more air in here.

584
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:10,038
Come back for the tray later, Nanny.

585
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:12,613
It's not Nanny, Paris. It's Rory. Can I come in?

586
00:24:13,683 --> 00:24:14,482
I guess.

587
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:19,746
Hi. I brought a bunch of school stuff from the past few days.

588
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:21,635
If there's anything missing, I can bring it over later.

589
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:23,944
Thank you.

590
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,528
No offense, but my soap's starting.

591
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:29,382
So, you're sick, huh?

592
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:30,708
You know what's wrong.

593
00:24:30,954 --> 00:24:32,024
You of all people.

594
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,053
That's Martin. His sister-in-law got kidnapped

595
00:24:36,162 --> 00:24:38,219
and he thinks his former lover is behind it.

596
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:39,265
Juicy.

597
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,590
So, don't you have an announcement?

598
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,493
What do you mean?

599
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:42,455
Did you get in?

600
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:44,302
- You know, we don't have to... 
- I know you did.

601
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,978
You've got that Harvard glow about you, the glow of destiny.

602
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:49,499
- Paris. 
- Just tell me.

603
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:50,893
I got in.

604
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:54,302
Amanda and Richard. I'm so over them.

605
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:56,677
So you've been incommunicado lately.

606
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:59,376
I've had Nanny hold all my calls, and the mail.

607
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:02,321
My parents are away, so I've been totally Howard Hughes-ing it.

608
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,542
- So did you tell them about Harvard? 
- No.

609
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:05,956
- Don't you think you should? 
- No.

610
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,342
- Well, don't you think they'll find out? 
- How?

611
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:10,145
You not moving out might be a tip-off.

612
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,654
I'll get an apartment in Cambridge, buy a Harvard sweatshirt,

613
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,790
talk about Mira Sorvino a lot. It's doable.

614
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:17,539
I did tell my mother about having sex with Jamie,

615
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:19,663
and her only reaction was to talk about how my father

616
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:21,410
hasn't pleased her in fifteen years.

617
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:23,115
- Yikes. 
- Like I couldn't tell.

618
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:24,605
And what's going on with your boyfriend?

619
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,833
I haven't called him either.

620
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:28,476
So the only people in your life right now work at General Hospital?

621
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:31,124
This isn't General Hospital. I don't deserve General Hospital.

622
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,960
Okay, you've got to stop doing this.

623
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:36,135
What happened? Harvard was my destiny.

624
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,904
I was flipping through Harvard class schedules when you were still delighting

625
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,692
to The Adventures of Gumby and Pokie.

626
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:42,306
I was more of a Pee Wee Herman kind of gal.

627
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:44,861
It's partly my parents' fault, they didn't brand me properly.

628
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:47,277
I should've been at the 92nd Street Y or Brick Church.

629
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:49,874
- Prep schools? 
- Pre-schools. It decides everything.

630
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:52,945
But I'm not totally blameless.

631
00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:55,926
I found a spot in my interview that I'm sure doomed me.

632
00:25:56,094 --> 00:25:57,636
You recorded your Harvard interview?

633
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,356
The plan was to archive everything,

634
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:01,696
then donate it to the university upon my demise.

635
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:04,763
Little did I expect that my demise would come this early.

636
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:06,571
... shouldn't even be taken into account.

637
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:09,294
This dovetails nicely into my feelings about population control.

638
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:11,301
It's a little hot in here, can we do something about that?

639
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:13,729
Anyway, population control has been dramatically successful

640
00:26:13,776 --> 00:26:16,544
in most European countries to the detriment of some, especially Italy,

641
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:18,282
- which is experiencing a marked drop...
- Do you think this has 

642
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:20,214
- anything to do with...
- just let me finish my thought here.

643
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,215
- But Paris... 
- Please!

644
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:26,028
Well, you said please, that's very polite.

645
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:27,635
I sound like a meth addict.

646
00:26:28,194 --> 00:26:30,559
I might as well record the new Justin Timberlake over this.

647
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:33,559
I hate that you're torturing yourself like this, in bed like this.

648
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:36,663
Proust wrote all three thousand pages of In Search of Lost Time in bed.

649
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,097
If it's good enough for him.

650
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:43,984
Bed is not a life plan, and you, my friend, need a life plan, so here it is.

651
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:45,363
You need to tell your parents about Harvard.

652
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:47,114
You need to start taking calls from people.

653
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:50,160
You need to check the mail so that you can see the other millions of universities

654
00:26:50,273 --> 00:26:51,809
that have no doubt accepted you

655
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:54,865
and that are probably dying to be in the Paris Gellar business.

656
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,410
You need to call your boyfriend back because he's going to be worried about you

657
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,921
and because none of this is his fault,

658
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:01,050
and you need to start by getting the hell out of bed.

659
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:03,448
You did not just say "be in the Paris Gellar business."

660
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:04,482
You know what I meant.

661
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,161
There is no alternative to Harvard.

662
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:08,947
Except Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Stanford,

663
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:10,539
Sarah Lawrence, et cetera, et cetera.

664
00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:13,058
Well, maybe you're right.

665
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,441
I'm unquestionably right.

666
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:16,018
But I'm not jumping up this second.

667
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:17,118
You don't have to rush it.

668
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:18,660
And I'm going to have to keep watching this,

669
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,556
at least until Adriana's wrongful conviction for aggravated assault is overturned.

670
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:24,379
- I understand. 
- Thanks.

671
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:33,303
You've got your remote, your water, your comic books.

672
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:35,389
Looks like we've got you all set up here, Fred Junior.

673
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:36,427
Yes, ma'am.

674
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,741
Oh, ma'am. You make me feel old. Stop it.

675
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,207
- Yes, ma'am. 
- No, I mean it, stop it.

676
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:41,015
Okay.

677
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:43,171
I think we're out of toothpaste.

678
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:45,685
Oh, sorry, Fred. Below the sink there's plenty more.

679
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,544
Oh, thank you. This is kind of fun.

680
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,111
Oh, it's fun having you guys.

681
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,209
I would've done that.

682
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:57,429
- I feel weird now. 
- Why?

683
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,198
About other people sleeping in my bed.

684
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:01,706
Oh, honey, don't worry. Fred and his wife don't seem...

685
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:02,428
Don't seem what?

686
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:04,062
Like they're feeling extremely romantic.

687
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:06,397
Oh, God, that didn't even cross my mind.

688
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:08,475
You're kidding! That's all I would've thought of.

689
00:28:08,547 --> 00:28:10,452
I'm thinking about it now, thank you very much.

690
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,905
Got all your stuff for Lane's?

691
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:13,257
Yeah, it wasn't a hard packing job.

692
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:18,398
Wow, these have really changed.

693
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:19,080
What have?

694
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,594
The pro/con lists. In all the hubbub, they slipped my mind.

695
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:24,947
Yale.

696
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:26,554
- What about it? 
- Yale.

697
00:28:26,735 --> 00:28:27,809
- What do you mean? 
- Yale.

698
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:28,634
Stop saying Yale.

699
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,212
It has double the pros of the other two.

700
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,302
I wouldn't say double.

701
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:34,544
Triple over filthy, dirty Princeton. It's kicking butt.

702
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,192
But I'm not done collecting my data yet.

703
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,373
You have a document the length of Nicholas Nickleby here.

704
00:28:38,486 --> 00:28:39,710
- Looks like you're done. 
- But...

705
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:40,646
What?

706
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:41,984
- Look at my wall. 
- So?

707
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:43,104
So that wall says something.

708
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:45,024
Yeah, it says the Harvard merchandising department

709
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:46,627
made a nice chunk of change off of us.

710
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,766
But how can I go to Yale with my wall looking like this?

711
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,073
It's a wall.

712
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,893
Look, honey, Luke was right.

713
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:55,900
The pro/con lists have to come to an end eventually.

714
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:58,639
But Luke also reminded us that it was supposed to be Harvard

715
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:00,861
regardless of a list. Everyone thinks that.

716
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:03,268
I don't. I don't.

717
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:06,238
I know I'm the one who said no to Yale loudly and a lot,

718
00:29:06,341 --> 00:29:08,675
but not anymore. Really, I just want what's right.

719
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,734
I know, but it has to be right for both of us.

720
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:14,026
If it's right for you, it's really right for me.

721
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,509
But I don't want you to hate the place I'm going.

722
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:17,645
Never.

723
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:21,087
Oh. Are you not ready for us yet?

724
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:22,233
Oh, no, we're ready for you, Fred.

725
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:24,379
- We hate to put you out. 
- No, it's perfectly okay.

726
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:26,642
I'm guessing you two are gonna fall sound asleep

727
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:27,917
the minute your heads hit that pillow.

728
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,341
Oh yeah, we're exhausted.

729
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:30,539
Have a good night.

730
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,628
Yeah, guys, yell if you need anything.

731
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,942
I don't wanna hear you yelling for any other reason.

732
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:39,443
Ah. So where's Jess tonight?

733
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:40,313
Working.

734
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:41,680
He works a lot, doesn't he?

735
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:43,212
- He's saving a lot, too. 
- Good.

736
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:45,392
He wants a better car. The one he's got keeps stalling.

737
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:47,231
And he's still working at Luke's, too, right?

738
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,885
So is he down to part-time at school?

739
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:50,550
What do you mean?

740
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:51,614
Getting work credit or something?

741
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,062
- No, he's going full time. 
- Oh yeah?

742
00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:54,221
Why do you say that?

743
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,478
I don't know. It's just, Wal-Mart, working at Luke's,

744
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:59,637
squiring you around town... it just seems like a lot of his time's accounted for.

745
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,000
That's crazy. He's a senior, he's going to school full time.

746
00:30:02,244 --> 00:30:03,780
- Just wondering. 
- Rest.

747
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:04,691
I'll try.

748
00:30:04,906 --> 00:30:06,560
And don't start the sock puppets with Fred Junior

749
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:08,142
or he'll never let you stop. Bye.

750
00:30:08,562 --> 00:30:09,202
Bye.

751
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:15,101
Excitement here never stops, Fred Junior.

752
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:19,914
Hi there.

753
00:30:20,073 --> 00:30:22,470
The Hatlestads, hi. I thought you went home.

754
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:25,321
Well, breakfast was so great and the town's so nice,

755
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,211
and you made staying over sound so fun,

756
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:29,013
that we decided to take you up on it.

757
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,966
- Is that okay? 
- It's more than okay.

758
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:34,225
Come on in, �cause you're staying here.

759
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:35,178
Thank you.

760
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,621
Your bedroom's right upstairs, you can't miss it.

761
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:41,946
Terrific, thanks.

762
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:44,584
How much room you take up on that couch there, Fred Junior?

763
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:46,513
- Pretty much all of it. 
- That's what I figured.

764
00:30:50,554 --> 00:30:52,310
So, who do you have staying in your room?

765
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:53,329
The second Poe and his wife.

766
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:55,464
For your sake, I hope they are very, very tired.

767
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:56,375
Why?

768
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,511
Nothing. I shouldn't have said anything.

769
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:02,197
- Hello? 
- I'm a nomad.

770
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,154
What?

771
00:31:03,354 --> 00:31:04,492
I am the lonely wanderer.

772
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,908
Hank Williams would be too sad to write a song about me.

773
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,718
Where are you?

774
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:09,473
I'm a Bedouin. I'm homeless!

775
00:31:09,586 --> 00:31:10,984
Okay, stop with that. Where are you?

776
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:13,493
I'm walking aimlessly around town.

777
00:31:13,651 --> 00:31:14,405
Why?

778
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:16,760
- The Hatlestads showed up. 
- But they went home.

779
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:21,030
Apparently I made the whole emergency fire accommodations sound so fun

780
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:22,945
- that they had second thoughts. 
- You're a terrific salesman.

781
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:24,723
And a terrific idiot.

782
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,062
So where are you right this second?

783
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:29,032
Oh, I'm in the middle of the street, a.k.a. my bedroom.

784
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:29,878
Mom.

785
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:31,936
I'm by the school, Luke's, that area.

786
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:33,222
Luke's, good. Go there.

787
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,151
- It's closed. 
- But Luke is upstairs.

788
00:31:35,595 --> 00:31:37,169
- Ask him if you can stay. 
- But...

789
00:31:37,256 --> 00:31:38,244
I bet the answer's yes.

790
00:31:38,383 --> 00:31:39,832
He'll make me eat a veggie burger!

791
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:41,911
- Get moving. 
- Fine. Bye.

792
00:31:42,096 --> 00:31:42,760
Bye.

793
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:46,897
Luke!

794
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:51,561
Luke!

795
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,418
Stella!

796
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:01,307
Who is that?

797
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:02,632
Lorelai.

798
00:32:02,842 --> 00:32:03,778
What are you doing down there?

799
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:06,185
Enjoying some air, getting some exercise, and freezing.

800
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,322
Well, go home.

801
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:10,620
Home? I have no home. Hunted, despised.

802
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:11,429
What?

803
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:12,811
It's from Ed Wood, the movie.

804
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,164
Have you gone bonkers?

805
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:17,594
People are bunking at my place and I need somewhere to stay.

806
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:20,047
And it just occurred to you now to look for a place?

807
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,280
The stupid Hatlestads showed up.

808
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:23,047
Who?

809
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,242
Pipe down out there!

810
00:32:26,523 --> 00:32:28,378
Go back to bed, Mrs. Slutsky!

811
00:32:28,505 --> 00:32:30,660
Don't talk to me that way, young man!

812
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,102
- Throw your keys down. 
- I will not!

813
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:34,962
No, Luke, Mrs. Slutsky.

814
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,125
I'll just come down.

815
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,013
- Do something! 
- Ditto.

816
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:39,206
- I'm coming down. 
- Okay.

817
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:45,378
My inn caught fire.

818
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:49,246
Hurry, Luke.

819
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,987
No, Young Chui, it was right to break up with her.

820
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:57,106
Why stay in a relationship when it's not going anywhere?

821
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:59,174
Life's too short, exactly...

822
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:02,882
No, I told you a joke last night, I need more time to come up with another one...

823
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,488
Look, it's getting late. I got my math test tomorrow, I better go...

824
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,677
Yeah, I'll call you to tell you how it went... Okay, night.

825
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:12,903
So Young Chui and his girlfriend are broken up, huh?

826
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:14,756
Yeah, and good riddance. She was very waspy.

827
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:16,486
What about you and Young Chui? Are you broken up?

828
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:19,371
No, my mom still thinks we're the perfect young Korean couple.

829
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:20,824
Weren't you supposed to be broken up by now?

830
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:22,791
Yeah, but Young Chui thinks it isn't time yet.

831
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:25,848
Why? This is a fake relationship. You were never really going out.

832
00:33:25,986 --> 00:33:28,900
I don't know. I bring it up every night and he just changes the subject.

833
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:30,042
You talk every night?

834
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:31,879
Pretty much. He's a little needy right now.

835
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:32,950
That's a lot of talking.

836
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,100
- Well, we're friends. 
- Just friends?

837
00:33:35,612 --> 00:33:36,580
What are you getting at?

838
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:39,708
Just that he's calling you every night and he keeps putting off your break-up,

839
00:33:39,837 --> 00:33:42,253
so God knows when you'll be able to date Dave Rygalski.

840
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:46,785
He's asking you to tell him jokes and to let him know how your math test went...

841
00:33:47,056 --> 00:33:47,798
So?

842
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:50,522
So... it sounds like he's in love with you.

843
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:54,117
No. No. Young Chui is not in love with me.

844
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,384
And it's not for you to take an innocent friendship like Young Chui and I have,

845
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,486
with its air of innocence and its... innocence.

846
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:02,662
Oh my God, he loves me.

847
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,547
That stupid boy's fallen in love with me!

848
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:06,302
It's not stupid. You're a catch.

849
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:09,611
But not his catch, I'm Dave's catch. I've already been caught.

850
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:11,096
You probably need to be more direct.

851
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:13,856
That fool. And I can't break up with him

852
00:34:13,937 --> 00:34:16,089
or my mom will never let me date. It's gotta come from him.

853
00:34:16,462 --> 00:34:17,245
What do I do?

854
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:20,420
Just a second?

855
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:28,880
- Bizarro day, huh? 
- Wouldn't wanna repeat it.

856
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:30,937
- The inn's still closed? 
- Just �til tomorrow.

857
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,827
What caused it?

858
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:33,877
They're not sure. Something electrical, probably.

859
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,075
That's usually the culprit.

860
00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:38,874
- Something the matter? 
- No.

861
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:39,888
Good.

862
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,196
- So how was school? 
- Same ol', same ol'.

863
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:43,159
You're still doing okay?

864
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:44,910
Doing my reading, writing, and arithmetic.

865
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:46,635
And you're still going, right?

866
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:48,642
What? Where's this coming from?

867
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:50,211
- There's been speculation. 
- From who?

868
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:53,011
My mom asked whether you're going full time to school.

869
00:34:53,278 --> 00:34:54,537
- Your mom? 
- Yeah.

870
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:55,893
Why's she so interested?

871
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:57,363
Because you're dating her daughter.

872
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:59,628
Oh, great, what else does she think I did?

873
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,037
Start the fire, put Phil Spector up to it?

874
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:03,359
I told her yes, you were going.

875
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:05,705
As they say on the Family Feud, good answer.

876
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,074
- So, I didn't lie to her? 
- No.

877
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:09,550
No?

878
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:12,090
Look, don't worry, I got it under control.

879
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:14,142
- Jess. 
- I'm going enough.

880
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:17,532
I've been picking up some extra shifts here and there, but I'm fine.

881
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:18,956
It's Mickey Mouse stuff anyway.

882
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:22,130
What it takes the others hours to learn, it takes me minutes.

883
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:24,009
- Well, if you're behind... 
- I'm not behind.

884
00:35:24,147 --> 00:35:26,145
But if you get behind, I can help you catch up.

885
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,096
Got it covered.

886
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,925
- If you say so. 
- I do.

887
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:29,927
Okay.

888
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:31,187
So how �bout you come out?

889
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,443
What's this?

890
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:34,194
He was just leaving, Mama.

891
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:35,413
Why is he here at all?

892
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:36,815
He came to borrow something.

893
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:38,249
Here.

894
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:43,706
Thank you.

895
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:46,416
- Baseball bat? 
- Cricket.

896
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:47,368
Night.

897
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:53,405
Oh, don't do that.

898
00:35:54,096 --> 00:35:54,844
Don't do what?

899
00:35:54,993 --> 00:35:57,649
Don't pull the sheet back after I pull it. I need more for this side.

900
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:03,993
- You pulled it back again. 
- Okay, I need it for my side.

901
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:05,376
- I need it to tuck in. 
- Same here.

902
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:07,624
- I always tuck it in on this side. 
- Let's tuck it in on both sides.

903
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:08,895
You tuck a bed in on both sides?

904
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,302
Yes, and then I slip down into it like I'm in a straitjacket or something.

905
00:36:11,393 --> 00:36:12,493
Oh, you must feel right at home there.

906
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:13,877
I so set you up for that.

907
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:15,050
Fine, tuck it in on your side.

908
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:18,392
You know, I really should take the couch.

909
00:36:18,495 --> 00:36:20,088
Me taking the bed doesn't feel right.

910
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:21,464
- Oh, now, come on. 
- What?

911
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:23,108
You browbeat me into giving you the bed

912
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:25,295
and pretending you don't want it now isn't working.

913
00:36:25,443 --> 00:36:27,251
I'm pretending to try to be polite.

914
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:29,294
I'm fine with the couch. You're the one that's exhausted.

915
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:30,932
You know, I'm actually not.

916
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:33,794
- Really? 
- I'm, like, strangely exhilarated.

917
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,595
I mean, as awful as what happened today was,

918
00:36:36,832 --> 00:36:38,665
I'm happy with how I handled it.

919
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,779
You know, you never know how you're gonna react in situations

920
00:36:40,887 --> 00:36:44,640
like this until something happens and I think I did pretty well.

921
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:45,961
Yeah, I do, too.

922
00:36:49,802 --> 00:36:50,442
Hello?

923
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:52,499
Hey, Nicole, hi...

924
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:54,609
Yeah, I'm good...

925
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:58,392
Oh, not much. There was a fire at the local inn out here and...

926
00:36:58,874 --> 00:37:00,400
Yeah, the one she works at, yeah...

927
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:01,556
Everybody's fine.

928
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,795
Yeah, just a lot of chaos for awhile.

929
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,520
So how was your thing today?

930
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:07,369
All right, fill me in tomorrow...

931
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:08,515
Seven's good...

932
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:09,673
Okay...

933
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,218
Okay, yeah... Goodnight.

934
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:14,179
That was Nicole.

935
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:15,966
So I heard. Why didn't you tell her I was here?

936
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:17,226
Didn't come up.

937
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,222
You mean, she didn't out of the clear blue

938
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:21,998
and for no reason ask you if I was sleeping over?

939
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:23,913
Just didn't seem necessary.

940
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:27,456
You have nothing to hide here. You just took in a refugee.

941
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,569
I know there's nothing to hide. It's just that...

942
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:32,283
- you've kinda become a... 
- Become what?

943
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:35,223
A sore point with me and Nicole.

944
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:36,427
What, how?

945
00:37:36,592 --> 00:37:38,531
On our first date, I was a little nervous

946
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,210
and I wasn't having any luck coming up with topics,

947
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:43,345
so I was just kinda blabbing a lot.

948
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:44,772
And then she ordered extra fries at dinner,

949
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:48,582
so it reminded me of you and I told her a quick story about you and French fries,

950
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:53,108
and that seemed fine. And then later, she ordered a third cup of coffee...

951
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:54,189
Oh, Luke.

952
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,278
And I mentioned you and your coffee thing,

953
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:59,488
and I noticed that Nicole kind of reacted a little,

954
00:37:59,638 --> 00:38:03,882
and ever since then, she's been a little sensitive to the issue.

955
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:04,993
Of course she is, Luke.

956
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:06,949
You don't talk about another woman on a first date.

957
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:08,085
Even if it's just a friend?

958
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:09,729
- They don't exist. 
- Come on.

959
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:11,337
Not on a first date.

960
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:13,728
No other women exist on a first date, not even my mother?

961
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:16,457
Do you really think talking about your mother on a first date is wise?

962
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,189
Not really.

963
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,541
You can maybe mention a sister, maybe.

964
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,987
And then you move on really, really quickly.

965
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,324
This is why I hate dating.

966
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:25,716
Unless you wanna be Mountain Man all your life,

967
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:27,845
you've got to abide by the rules and customs.

968
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,293
Sorry, I have to get up super early tomorrow.

969
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:31,700
- No problem. What time? 
- Six.

970
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:34,292
I get up at quarter to five every morning.

971
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:35,996
Why in the world would you get up that early?

972
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,742
I don't know, to run my business?

973
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,217
Well, change businesses.

974
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,303
- Ooh, wow, total d�j� vu. 
- Really?

975
00:38:43,497 --> 00:38:44,558
It's the alarm clock.

976
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:51,152
I had a dream once that you set eighteen alarm clocks to get me up,

977
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:52,500
which is not a bad way to get me up.

978
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:53,293
Where were we?

979
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,557
We were at my house.

980
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,586
I got up, I went downstairs for coffee,

981
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:02,360
and you talked to my stomach.

982
00:39:02,612 --> 00:39:03,733
Why on earth I do that?

983
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:05,402
Because I was pregnant.

984
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,904
- Twins. 
- Mine?

985
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:11,010
What am I, dream tramp? Of course yours.

986
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:12,452
We were married?

987
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:13,590
Yeah.

988
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,789
- Did I not mention that? 
- No.

989
00:39:20,702 --> 00:39:23,814
You know, you shouldn't drink coffee when you're pregnant.

990
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:26,042
True.

991
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:29,571
It's probably why Rory's a caffeine addict.

992
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:31,261
Right, you're right.

993
00:39:31,777 --> 00:39:32,924
Dream go beyond that?

994
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:37,251
No. Yyou talked to my stomach and then you ki...

995
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:41,460
- Well, no. 
- Oh, okay. Well...

996
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:46,257
- Night. 
- Yeah, night.

997
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,831
Luke and Sookie have worked things out.

998
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:15,564
There does seem to be a grudging respect thing going on.

999
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:18,592
Get the ricotta fritters started, guys. I wanna serve those first.

1000
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,619
We making the Cajun Eggs Benedict again?

1001
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,489
- I don't know, we could. 
- Let's do it, it was good.

1002
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:23,943
The Cajun was all your doing.

1003
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:26,538
Only because I knocked the cayenne pepper into your hollandaise.

1004
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:28,434
How do you think they invented the Reese's cup

1005
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:30,898
and penicillin, my friend? We can win the Nobel here.

1006
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:34,389
- Morning. 
- You're up early.

1007
00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:35,883
Gotta catch me that worm. See ya.

1008
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,179
- Where you off to? 
- School.

1009
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:39,483
- This early? 
- I got a lab project going on.

1010
00:40:39,725 --> 00:40:41,034
Me and my team are meeting early.

1011
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,387
Have a good day.

1012
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:43,421
If I have a choice.

1013
00:40:44,438 --> 00:40:45,372
Good morning.

1014
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:46,795
- Talk to you later. 
- Later.

1015
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:49,227
By the way, your boyfriend snores.

1016
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:50,742
Didn't need to know that.

1017
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:52,084
Hello...

1018
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:54,354
It is?...

1019
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:57,850
I love you, I love you...

1020
00:40:58,521 --> 00:40:59,176
Thanks.

1021
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:00,359
We're open.

1022
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:02,585
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please.

1023
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,014
That was just Chief Baker on the phone who told me

1024
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:07,395
in that deep sexy voice of his that the inn is officially reopened.

1025
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:13,692
Right now it's just me and the staffers, but soon, very soon,

1026
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:15,396
you will have your stuff back and you can go home.

1027
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:18,264
Thank you, Lorelai. Listen, from our group,

1028
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:20,307
we want to give you this.

1029
00:41:20,496 --> 00:41:24,946
Oh, well, that's the nicest dead bird I've ever gotten. Thanks, Fred.

1030
00:41:25,135 --> 00:41:26,165
It's from all of us.

1031
00:41:26,493 --> 00:41:28,525
Right. Thank you Poe Society.

1032
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:29,707
Coming Sookie?

1033
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:30,845
I'm coming.

1034
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,931
Okay, you need to caramelize the hazelnuts for the brioche French toast,

1035
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:36,800
add some Madeira to the pear-poaching liquid

1036
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,043
and add some chives to the cream for the sheared eggs.

1037
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:40,522
Don't burn anything, got it.

1038
00:41:40,722 --> 00:41:41,669
I've gotta change for school.

1039
00:41:41,884 --> 00:41:42,770
Go, go, we'll see you later.

1040
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,276
Let's go.

1041
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:47,050
Ah, here they are.

1042
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:48,663
Hi, Michel. Hi, Chief.

1043
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:50,333
Don't we love our chief?

1044
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:51,991
I bet he can beat up all the other chiefs.

1045
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:53,590
- For sure he can. 
- Can we get on with this?

1046
00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:55,187
Let me just unlock the door here.

1047
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:58,444
Michel, the first thing I wanna do is get into all the rooms

1048
00:41:58,597 --> 00:42:01,413
and get all the guests' stuff into the lobby and organized for them to pick up.

1049
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:03,610
Sookie, go to the kitchen and let me know what's what.

1050
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:04,844
Maybe we can open for dinner.

1051
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:06,123
- Dinner? 
- Yeah.

1052
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:08,106
Anyone give you a heads up about what's inside?

1053
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:08,780
No.

1054
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:11,320
You might wanna wait �til you get inside to make your plans.

1055
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,205
And go slow.

1056
