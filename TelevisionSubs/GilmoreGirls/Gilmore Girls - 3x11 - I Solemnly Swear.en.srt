1
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:13,143
- Hi. 
- Good evening.

2
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,736
- May I take your coats? 
- Oh, sure, thanks.

3
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:17,133
That’s the most absurd thing I’ve ever heard.

4
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:18,438
Your mother’s in the living room.

5
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,908
So last chance to run, huh?

6
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:20,956
Excuse me?

7
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:22,068
Just ignore her.

8
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:25,340
Of course I said it.

9
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:28,843
I can’t imagine who would take jackbooted as a compliment.

10
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:32,422
I will not apologize. Every time she went to the pantry,

11
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,004
I thought she was marching on Poland.

12
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:38,213
Oh, I see, because I want things a certain way, I’m unreasonable?

13
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:40,911
Why, that is the most absurd...

14
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:43,298
I want to see this document. Fax it to me immediately.

15
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:44,572
Fax it to me immediately?

16
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,202
She’s part of the electronic age.

17
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:48,382
Tomorrow morning is completely unacceptable.

18
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:52,233
It’s unacceptable because I’m paying you three hundred dollars an hour.

19
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:55,438
So turn that little near-luxury car around, go back to your office,

20
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,378
and fax me that libelous scrap of paper.

21
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:59,103
Ask him if he can pick up some ice cream, too.

22
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,612
Tell your wife to tape your daughter’s recital.

23
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:03,820
Unbelievable.

24
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:05,008
- Hi Mom. 
- Hi Grandma.

25
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,975
When did you two get here?

26
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:08,361
Sometime between the second absurd and the third unbelievable.

27
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:11,137
I apologize. That call caught me off guard.

28
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,904
Is everything all right, Grandma?

29
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:14,209
- Everything’s fine. 
- Are you sure?

30
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:15,714
- I’m sure. 
- You look peeved.

31
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:17,543
- I’m not peeved. 
- You look peeved.

32
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:20,031
Kindly stop making me say the word peeved.

33
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:21,608
Mom, spill it. What’s wrong?

34
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,834
That was our lawyer calling to inform me

35
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,551
that one of our former maids is suing for wrongful termination.

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,301
You might at least act surprised.

37
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:32,678
It’s not the first time, is it?

38
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,255
- It most certainly is. 
- Really?

39
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:35,734
Yes, Lorelai, really.

40
00:02:35,838 --> 00:02:36,902
Well, then, I’m surprised.

41
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:38,736
It’s beyond surprising, it’s outrageous.

42
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,866
What did Grandpa say?

43
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,255
Your Grandfather’s still in London

44
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:42,723
helping his mother close down her house.

45
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,040
Of course he’d be gone when this happens.

46
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:45,602
I think he planned it that way.

47
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:46,564
Which maid was it?

48
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,500
Gerta, the one from Hamburg, Germany.

49
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:49,452
Which one was she?

50
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,086
You remember – she was the one

51
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:52,954
you made all those Hamburg/hamburger jokes to.

52
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:55,028
- God, I beat that dead horse. 
- With glee.

53
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,599
- She was the clomper. 
- The clomper?

54
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,900
She’d be upstairs making the beds

55
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,919
and it’d sound like a Munich beer hall rally.

56
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,209
- That’s why you fired her? 
- Yes.

57
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,200
- Because she made noise when she walked? 
- Yes.

58
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:06,017
- Was she a good maid otherwise? 
- What?

59
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,634
Besides the clomping, was she polite,

60
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:10,308
on time, made sure the little fork went on the outside?

61
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:11,762
Have you been listening to me?

62
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,758
She was not performing her duties as I wished them to be performed.

63
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,185
Everything else is beside the point.

64
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,818
I guess it’s always something, isn’t it?

65
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:18,740
What’s that supposed to mean?

66
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:20,220
It means you always seem to find the one thing

67
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,033
about a maid that negates all of her good qualities.

68
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:25,116
I mean, at a certain point, isn’t it just easier to let a couple things slide?

69
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,188
- I see. So it’s my fault? 
- I didn’t say that.

70
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,454
No, Lorelai, you did.

71
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,743
For years, I’ve been listening to you and your father

72
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,738
and everyone else go on and on about how demanding I am,

73
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:35,515
how I have to have things a certain way.

74
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:37,911
Well, guess what? I pay to have them that way.

75
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,938
I pay more than anyone else pays their maids,

76
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,883
and when things are not the way I want, that means I’m not getting what I paid for.

77
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,256
Why is that so hard to understand?

78
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:45,868
It isn’t hard to understand, it’s just...

79
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:48,525
If you pay for first class and the airline sticks you in coach,

80
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,061
people expect you to be upset.

81
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:52,559
No one calls you demanding or unreasonable.

82
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,351
And yet here is this woman whom I pay more than she can get anywhere else in Hartford,

83
00:03:56,457 --> 00:04:00,020
whose severance package could finance a summer cruise down the Rhine,

84
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:02,678
dragging me into court saying that I was unfair.

85
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,742
Why? Because having paid for one thing,

86
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,040
I’m not content with something else? That makes me unfair?

87
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,593
Well, then, so be it. Let someone else pay first class and ride in steerage, not me.

88
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,656
Excuse me, Mrs. Gilmore, dinner’s ready

89
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:15,187
Thank you, Brooke, we’ll be right there.

90
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,420
Wait, wait, wait.

91
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:19,596
Do you hear that?

92
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,352
- Hear what? 
- Exactly.

93
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,079
You know, next time I want some grapefruit,

94
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,533
I’m just gonna ask for a kazoo

95
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,903
because you can only seem to get me the most bizarre opposite.

96
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:26,953
What is your problem?

97
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:28,315
I need you to... What?

98
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:31,266
Oh, it started. You were supposed to call me.

99
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:32,156
Stop talking.

100
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:34,661
I understand perfectly. You wanna be a dictator.

101
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:35,895
Oh, come off it.

102
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,324
Commandant St. James says, "Brussels sprouts!

103
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:40,037
You will bring me the Brussels sprouts."

104
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:42,336
I’m trying to plan a menu here, Jackson!

105
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,939
Fill me in, please.

106
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:46,360
Jackson brought pea tendrils instead of Brussels sprouts.

107
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,096
Aren’t we Evil Knievel?

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,253
- Coffee? 
- Oh, please.

109
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,522
Pea tendrils are too delicate to serve with the lamb shank!

110
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:52,913
I don’t think that they are.

111
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,608
Where are the Brussels sprouts?

112
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:56,759
I looked at the stalks, they weren’t good enough.

113
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,259
You always do this to me.

114
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:01,034
Doesn’t it matter that I care so much about the quality of the produce

115
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:03,830
that I sell you that I’d be willing to risk an enormous argument

116
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:05,931
- just to save your dinner. 
- What?

117
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:07,645
- Oops, that was dumb. 
- Save my dinner?

118
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:08,756
You know what I meant.

119
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,506
Yes, my dinner is out standing on a ledge.

120
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:13,883
- Oh no! What’s gonna happen? 
- Sookie.

121
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,167
Oh wait! What’s that?

122
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,794
It’s a bird, it’s a plane,

123
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,617
it’s Super Jackson and his atomic pea tendrils!

124
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:21,533
You wanna get another produce guy?

125
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,170
- Maybe I should! 
- Well, go ahead!

126
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:25,394
- Don’t tempt me! 
- That’s it, I am leaving.

127
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,456
Go! And take the tendrils with you!

128
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:28,368
Fine!

129
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:31,460
- See you tonight? 
- I love you.

130
00:06:32,068 --> 00:06:33,488
And it always ends with a hug.

131
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,372
Okay, what do you need?

132
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,419
The new insurance policies you ordered.

133
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:39,746
Good. Now the inspector’s supposed to be coming by

134
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:42,342
to check the place out tomorrow, so you’re gonna have to show him around.

135
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:43,073
What?

136
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:44,395
You’re covering for me, remember?

137
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:45,791
Oh, yes, that’s right.

138
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,569
Tomorrow the two of you go back to school.

139
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,971
It’s not school, it’s a one-day course at the learning center.

140
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,052
How to run an inn.

141
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,452
Yes, amazing you’ve been able to fake it so long.

142
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,750
This is specific to opening small inns, bed and breakfasts.

143
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:58,455
I see. Order half of everything.

144
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:00,247
There – you owe me seventy-five dollars.

145
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:01,962
Why are you being such a snob about this?

146
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:02,945
You went to hotel school.

147
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:04,927
I attended the Ecole Hôtelière de Genève.

148
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:06,838
Wow, that’s gotta make one hell of a sweatshirt.

149
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,705
It was one of the premiere hotel schools in the world.

150
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:12,223
You two, on the other hand, are going to take a two-hour course at the Radisson.

151
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:15,230
Jackson’s taken a lot of courses through The Learning Center

152
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,508
and he loves it. He took beekeeping...

153
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,670
Jackson keeps bees?

154
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,273
No, it turned out he was allergic.

155
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:24,022
One stung his lip and his whole head blew up to three times his normal size.

156
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:26,028
Please tell me you have pictures.

157
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:28,798
He also took a course in how to buy foreclosed real estate,

158
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,827
and how to write a diary.

159
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:31,323
How do you not know how to write a diary?

160
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:33,100
- He’s a searcher. 
- Yes, he is.

161
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:35,675
Plus, I think he was really lonely before we got together

162
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,046
and he didn’t live near a good bar.

163
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,211
Yes, well, I predict that tomorrow will be a complete waste of time and money,

164
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,223
and I will be here to laugh at you when you return.

165
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,401
Thanks for your support.

166
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:46,059
Forget him. Opening our own is a huge step,

167
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:47,764
and anything that might help is worth trying.

168
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:48,987
Exactly partner.

169
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:51,645
Now tell me you got pictures of Jackson and his giant head.

170
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:52,904
I’ll bring ‘em in tomorrow.

171
00:07:58,486 --> 00:07:59,187
Hey Paris.

172
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:01,291
Have you looked over the votes for commencement speaker?

173
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:04,195
Are the ones for Princess Diana’s butler jokes or real?

174
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:05,690
I’d say jokes.

175
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:07,436
- What about the ones for Dr. Phil? 
- I think real.

176
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,622
I knew that suggestion box was a bad idea.

177
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:12,877
Watch Choate get Joan Didion while we’re being read "Eloise at the Plaza."

178
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,528
Listen, before the others get here,

179
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,494
we should probably decide what we’re going to do.

180
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,340
About what?

181
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:19,127
About the prom coup Francie staged last week.

182
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,426
You mean booking Wadsworth Mansion?

183
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,137
Using all of the money reserved for the telescope

184
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,622
that we wanted to buy for the senior gift.

185
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:26,090
Why does one pinhead always have to vote for Jerry Garcia?

186
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,354
I’m not sure if the deposit check has been sent yet, but...

187
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:29,792
- I already took care of that. 
- What?

188
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:32,655
Wadsworth Mansion is owned by the Connecticut Daughters of the Mayflower.

189
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:36,367
Most of those biddies couldn’t negotiate an icy sidewalk much less a contract.

190
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:39,511
Took me about five minutes on the phone to get them down to half their asking price.

191
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:40,187
You’re kidding.

192
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,864
There was no way I was letting the class gift be a stupid tree

193
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,108
just so Ginger Spice can have her Barbie dream prom.

194
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:46,152
She’s a sneak.

195
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,765
She’s not smart enough to be a sneak.

196
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:49,179
Anyone can call a meeting.

197
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,630
It’s that loser Mr. Hunter that let her get away with it.

198
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:53,166
She kind of forced him into it.

199
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,368
You can’t force a teacher into something, Rory.

200
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,192
No, it was Hunter.

201
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:59,189
He’s been jealous of me since I got into office.

202
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:02,491
Whenever I announce I have a new motion to introduce, he flinches.

203
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,697
Actually, physically tightens up for a moment.

204
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:06,131
- It’s creepy. 
- Yeah, but...

205
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:08,010
Well, out fearless leaders at work already.

206
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,132
I feel so safe.

207
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:12,081
- That girl bugs me. 
- Relax, she’s harmless.

208
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:13,217
Paris, Rory.

209
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:15,312
Paris, Rory. Bed wetter.

210
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:16,972
- Shall we sit? 
- Fine, let’s sit.

211
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:22,121
I call this meeting of the student council to order.

212
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,638
- Is the secretary ready? 
- I am.

213
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:27,672
Then let’s proceed.

214
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:31,979
First of all, I’d like to apologize for missing last week’s somewhat impromptu meeting.

215
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:35,072
As most of you know, its scheduling was somewhat unorthodox

216
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,201
since the meeting was a supplementary meeting,

217
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,588
which was a concept invented by me.

218
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,080
So the fact that anyone would hold a meeting invented

219
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,562
by a certain person without that certain person seems, well...

220
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:47,287
let’s see, what’s the word?

221
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:49,940
Mutinous, insulting, underhanded,

222
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,804
and in the end, fruitless,

223
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:54,969
since I managed to re-negotiate the rental fee for the Wadsworth Mansion

224
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,869
so that we’ll be able to have the prom

225
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:59,741
and give the school a respectable senior gift

226
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:01,599
in the form of a telescope.

227
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:03,433
Any questions, Mr. Christian?

228
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,846
I mean, Mr. Hunter.

229
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:06,439
No.

230
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:08,860
Good. So, now that that’s out of the way,

231
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,437
let’s move onto other business.

232
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:11,593
Francie?

233
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:13,314
As you know, Health Week is coming up.

234
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,389
We have speakers lined up to discuss everything

235
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:18,875
from heart disease and exercise to the dangers of sun damage and fried food.

236
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:20,611
Everyone’s booked and ready to go.

237
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:24,195
The only thing left to figure out is where to set up the sign-up table

238
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:25,958
for the annual blood drive.

239
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,618
- Geez! 
- What’s the matter?

240
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,139
She hates the word blood.

241
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:30,500
Give me a heart attack.

242
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,164
Just keep your hands on your ears.

243
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:33,275
Tell me when it’s over.

244
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,667
As I was saying before the freak-out,

245
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:38,375
we need to figure out where to place the sign up table for the blood drive.

246
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:40,325
- I can still here her. 
- Hum to yourself.

247
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:41,294
Continue, please.

248
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:43,225
I am proposing putting it in the cafeteria.

249
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,375
It’s got easy access, maximum exposure,

250
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:48,718
and almost ninety percent of the student body visits the cafeteria every day.

251
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:49,778
It’s the perfect location.

252
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:50,798
- Well? 
- No.

253
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:51,744
Excuse me?

254
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:53,930
You can’t set up in the cafeteria. It’s a fire hazard.

255
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:54,658
It is?

256
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,686
Yes, it’s a fire hazard. You’ll have to find another place.

257
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:58,862
- You’re kidding. 
- I never kid about fire safety.

258
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:02,350
Rory, I actually know the fire codes for the cafeteria,

259
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:04,691
and as long as we don’t cram more than three hundred people in there,

260
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:07,013
we can start an opium den and the fire department wouldn’t care.

261
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,861
A, Francie, I think they would care,

262
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,865
and B, I’m not talking about numbers.

263
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,113
You set up that table, get people thinking about blood,

264
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:15,003
someone smells smoke, and the next thing you know,

265
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:18,254
fifty stampeding teenagers are using your body to lever open a door.

266
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:19,399
I won’t allow that.

267
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:21,049
This is Xanadu-level of insane.

268
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,075
You do realize you’re opposing the blood drive?

269
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,324
No, I’m opposing the blood drive in the cafeteria.

270
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:26,573
Is it really that big a deal?

271
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:28,789
It’s the rules, Paris, the rules of common decency,

272
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:30,731
and I’ll be damned if I let Francie ignore those rules.

273
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:33,353
Well, okay, motion denied.

274
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,459
The senior class president will come up with an alternate plan

275
00:11:36,548 --> 00:11:38,785
for the location of the sign-up table for the blood drive.

276
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,418
Now Louise, poke John Williams over there

277
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:43,275
and tell her she can cut the score, we’re moving on.

278
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,751
Advertising space in the yearbook is only fifty percent sold as of right now.

279
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,210
What are we doing to do about this?

280
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:51,223
Roger, yes?

281
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:58,176
Dinner!

282
00:11:58,313 --> 00:11:59,148
Over here.

283
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:03,021
We are so in luck. It was international grab bag night at Al’s.

284
00:12:03,112 --> 00:12:04,400
Cool. Did you peek?

285
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,254
And ruin the whole point of the mystery dinner? I think not. Pick.

286
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,625
- That one. 
- Okay. I love this.

287
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,258
It’s food and a game all in one.

288
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:13,481
- Now we open them at the same time. 
- I know the rules.

289
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,443
And do not jump the gun.

290
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,839
There’s a lot of pressure associated with international grab bag night.

291
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,425
I am your mother, it is my responsibility to give you structure.

292
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:21,474
Now, on three – one, two, three.

293
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,648
Moroccan.

294
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:26,245
You always say Moroccan.

295
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,662
And sooner or later, I will be right. What’s yours?

296
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,570
Pan-Asian, with a hint of English Colonial,

297
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,225
and a few South African influences.

298
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:34,592
Way to hedge your bet. Kitchen?

299
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,800
Just let me check the machine.

300
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:39,983
Ms. Gilmore, it’s Bob Merrimam, your mother’s lawyer.

301
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:42,871
I’m calling about the little matter of this lawsuit she’s involved in.

302
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:46,122
We’d like it if you could give a deposition on her behalf. It shouldn’t be a big deal.

303
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:49,138
If you could just call me tomorrow with some times that would be convenient for you,

304
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:50,566
- I can set something up... 
- Oh, no!

305
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:53,014
- What? 
- No, no, no, no, no.

306
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:54,121
- Hello? 
- No.

307
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:55,989
- Who is this? 
- I am not giving a deposition.

308
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:57,326
Of course you are, don’t be ridiculous.

309
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,457
Please leave me out of this.

310
00:12:58,596 --> 00:13:01,924
I see. So you’re just going to let this lead-footed teutonic chambermaid

311
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:05,022
drag your mother into a public forum and humiliate her, is that it?

312
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,517
- Is that what I’m hearing? 
- Mom.

313
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:09,000
Her lawyer knows we asked for this deposition.

314
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:10,588
How do you think it’s going to look

315
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,409
when you refuse to testify for your own mother?

316
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:13,726
Like it’s none of my business.

317
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:16,122
Oh, and I’m sure the twelve rocket scientists they assemble

318
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:17,904
as a jury of my peers will see it that way.

319
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:20,080
Honestly, Mom, I doubt they’ll be able to find twelve people

320
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:22,006
in the state of Connecticut who haven’t been fired by you.

321
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:23,920
I can’t believe my own daughter won’t come to my defense.

322
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,277
I’m not gonna lie for you.

323
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:27,935
I just want you to tell them how I treat my maids.

324
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,333
I’m not gonna lie for you.

325
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,837
All you have to do is tell them I treat the help fairly.

326
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:33,357
I’m not gonna lie for you.

327
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:36,864
Lorelai, there is something called family loyalty.

328
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:39,092
It means when someone is in trouble, you help them,

329
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:41,554
as I have helped you several times over the years.

330
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:44,780
The very least you could do in return is spend half an hour

331
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,665
saying something kind about your mother.

332
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:48,504
Fine.

333
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:50,428
Thank you. Your devotion is touching.

334
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:53,500
I have to give a deposition.

335
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,671
I don’t think this is Moroccan – or at least not recently.

336
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:57,562
Want some of mine?

337
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,794
- Nope. 
- Yikes.

338
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,065
- Luke’s? 
- Let’s go.

339
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:07,904
I can’t stress enough the value of a good paint job.

340
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:10,685
One of the first decisions you’ll have to make

341
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:15,190
when you open your inn is whether to employ your housekeepers individually

342
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:18,647
or contract out to a housekeeping service.

343
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:22,088
If you use a service, you will be assured of having

344
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:26,998
a replacement housekeeper if one should call in sick or quit suddenly.

345
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:28,754
But you’ll pay two dollars more an hour

346
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:31,361
and they’ll be loyal to the service, not to you.

347
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:34,615
However, you’ll probably end up paying a bit more

348
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:37,023
than if you hired them individually.

349
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:38,456
I can’t believe you’re taking notes.

350
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:42,419
He has said nothing in the last two hours that we didn’t already know,

351
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:44,469
and he’s saying it really condescendingly.

352
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:47,090
So in addition to being bored, I’m getting hostile,

353
00:14:47,197 --> 00:14:50,034
and a little insecure ‘cause you’re studying and I’m not.

354
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,929
- Pick a color. 
- Pink!

355
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:53,536
- ‘Cause you’re a girl. 
- Exactly.

356
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,487
P–i–n–k.

357
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:56,495
- Pick a number. 
- Five.

358
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,891
You will marry Shaun Cassidy and cheat with David.

359
00:15:00,202 --> 00:15:01,134
Well, good for me.

360
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:02,250
My turn.

361
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,175
Some of us are here to learn.

362
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:06,823
- Sorry. 
- Yeah, sorry.

363
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:08,952
We had a cootie catcher...

364
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:09,968
- We’re sorry. 
- Sorry.

365
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:14,073
As I was saying, the points we’ve covered should get you started,

366
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:17,678
but remember, it’s a long process,

367
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,578
so don’t get discouraged.

368
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:24,570
I’m sure one day I’ll be staying in each and every one of you inns.

369
00:15:24,694 --> 00:15:25,734
He’s not staying in our inn.

370
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,377
Now don’t run off just yet. We’ve got one final treat.

371
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,219
I’d like to introduce you all to John Mattern.

372
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:35,723
Hello everyone.

373
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:38,083
I’m very pleased to be here addressing you today.

374
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,626
I asked Brian if I could just have a few minutes at the end of today

375
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,996
to show you all some opportunities

376
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:46,982
that I think you’re going to find really exciting.

377
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:48,508
I know that I do.

378
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:49,854
If we could.

379
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:56,500
Now this is a lovely property that has just become available right outside of Litchfield.

380
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,036
It’s a sales pitch?

381
00:15:58,211 --> 00:15:59,926
They spend two hours telling us nothing,

382
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:01,994
then try to sell us lame property?

383
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:03,950
We already know the place we’re buying.

384
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,902
- I know. 
- So what do we do?

385
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,937
I’m crushing your head, I’m crushing your head. Let’s go.

386
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:13,608
A perfectly restorable sun porch wraps around the entire main structure.

387
00:16:13,762 --> 00:16:16,367
Let’s step inside this diamond in the rough.

388
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:18,380
Unbelievably shocking.

389
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,940
That we could work at an inn for so long and learn so little.

390
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:22,359
We must be some kind of dumb.

391
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:24,350
Who would ever have thought that all inns need doors?

392
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:25,793
- Not me. 
- And floors.

393
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:27,433
Doors and floors, we can’t afford that.

394
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:30,289
Well, we better, otherwise our guests will fall right through to China.

395
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,082
I can just imagine the phone calls.

396
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,950
What was Jackson thinking saying these courses were good?

397
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,734
Please, you’re asking me? The man took a course in diary writing.

398
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:39,127
Thank God – food.

399
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:40,514
So, is it worth it if we can make up

400
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:42,476
our seventy-five dollar admission fee in cookies?

401
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,323
considering that in the past hour, I uttered the phrase,

402
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,816
"My God, I should’ve listened to Michel,"

403
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,813
these better be the best damn cookies in the world.

404
00:16:50,161 --> 00:16:51,702
And they taste like feet.

405
00:16:51,856 --> 00:16:54,074
Oh, well, even their cookies suck.

406
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,456
Stand by, I’m going in for coffee.

407
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,776
Sookie? Sookie St. James?

408
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,392
It’s Joe... Joe Mastoni from the Deerhill Lodge.

409
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:02,828
Oh my God, Joe! Joe!

410
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:06,117
Joe from the Deerhill Lodge! It’s Joe from the Deerhill Lodge!

411
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:08,057
How are you? Sorry.

412
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,030
Well, come here.

413
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:13,357
Oh! Lorelai, this is Joe. Joe, Lorelai.

414
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:15,902
Nice to meet you. This is Alex, my partner.

415
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,043
Business partner.

416
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,450
Oh, clarification duly noted. Nice to meet you.

417
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,805
Joe and I worked together one summer up in the Berkshires.

418
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:23,915
Oh, God, we had a wild time that summer, didn’t we?

419
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:25,456
You had a wild time, huh? Do tell.

420
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,319
We’d all work fourteen hours straight,

421
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:29,573
party ‘til dawn, then pile in Joe’s van

422
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:33,131
and wake up in New Hampshire or Maine with just enough time

423
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:34,591
to get back for the next shift.

424
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,029
We had a real interesting crew.

425
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,739
Sookie, me, Feldman, Mellon, Bung...

426
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:40,381
- Bung? 
- He was the grill man.

427
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,251
He had been up there for a couple years already,

428
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:43,930
but Joe and I were both in prep.

429
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,661
And I repeat - Bung?

430
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:48,298
Don’t look at me. I’m still wondering if Mellon’s a man or a woman.

431
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:50,013
You know, I promised myself after that summer,

432
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:52,831
I would never chop small green things en masse ever again.

433
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:56,245
Or drink all the leftover wine on an empty stomach.

434
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:57,585
Let me see your hands.

435
00:17:58,318 --> 00:18:00,269
Hey, nice blisters.

436
00:18:00,489 --> 00:18:03,018
Let me see yours. Ooh, not bad, not bad.

437
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:05,641
I’m more careful about using the towels with the hot stuff these days.

438
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:07,140
- Sissy. 
- Yeah, yeah.

439
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:08,247
So what are you doing here?

440
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:11,371
Lorelai and I are opening an inn together, so we came for a class.

441
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,240
Really? Alex and I are here for a class

442
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:14,694
about opening your own coffee place.

443
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,946
- Chain of coffee places, actually. 
- That’s great.

444
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,989
We’ll see. It’s pretty new territory for us.

445
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:20,643
Joe at least knows the food industry.

446
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:22,984
I’m coming from ironworks, so I basically know what the security gate

447
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:24,642
you pull down at the end of the night should be made of.

448
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:27,069
Don’t listen to him. Alex is an incredible businessman.

449
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,000
That’s true.

450
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:29,885
So far, we’ve got the business model planned out,

451
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:31,980
there’s a couple of prime locations we’re interested in.

452
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:34,683
The only thing left to do besides build the place is pick a name.

453
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:37,176
Oh, little tip, don’t choose anything cute.

454
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:39,523
- Like Jitters. 
- Or Spill the Beans.

455
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:41,437
- Or Higher Ground. 
- Or The Mudhouse.

456
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:44,007
- Actually, I kinda like that. 
- Oh, me too. We call dibs.

457
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:45,390
I thought you were opening an inn.

458
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,961
Well, we wanna keep our options open.

459
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:48,570
Hey, did you hear about Feldman’s restaurant?

460
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:50,439
The Feldster opened a restaurant?

461
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:52,639
Okay, I know I’m repeating myself, but the Feldster?

462
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:54,448
I can’t believe he opened his own place.

463
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,788
He spent the whole summer getting stoned in the walk-in.

464
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,753
- He was our baker. 
- Right, that figures.

465
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:00,705
Baker, getting baked, I’m there.

466
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,752
Oh, congratulations. You still can’t have The Mudhouse.

467
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,954
Hey, you remember the last reception we catered?

468
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:07,467
The parakeets, everyone dressed as knights and ladies.

469
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:08,416
Oh God!

470
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:09,988
Old friends, huh?

471
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:11,816
Yeah, there’s nothing like ‘em.

472
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:15,743
I never did figure out how Bung got into a fight with the bride.

473
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:18,498
One minute everything was fine, the next he’s beaning her with the ice sculpture.

474
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:21,908
Hey, remember the time you and Fat Sal got locked in the freezer overnight?

475
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:23,362
Fat Sal?

476
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,049
- Work with me here. 
- Oh, Fat Sal, yes, right.

477
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:29,111
Then Feldman got into a fight with the bride’s mother.

478
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:31,671
That’s right! He went after the whole bridal party.

479
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,654
And you remember how me and the Bruiser –

480
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,499
Never liked that guy.

481
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,799
We found you and Fat Sal in the morning

482
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:37,443
and you were frozen together like bacon.

483
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:38,764
Yeah. You know, I still can’t eat bacon.

484
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:39,450
Well...

485
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:41,032
And you remember what Feldman told the cops?

486
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:42,763
Oh, yeah!

487
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:46,030
And then before Bruiser and I would let you out,

488
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:47,841
we made you and Fat Sal kiss.

489
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:49,394
I’m not sure I remember that.

490
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:51,580
You know, I actually don’t remember

491
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:53,080
what Feldman told the cops.

492
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,292
He tried to pretend he didn’t speak English, remember?

493
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:57,806
That’s right, oh my God! The flooginshorts!

494
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,404
Yes, the flooginshorts!

495
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,876
Oh, great. Now we have to make up our own language?

496
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:03,147
This is getting exhausting.

497
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:05,323
You know, Feldman’s restaurant’s right here in Hartford.

498
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:06,434
No, really?

499
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:08,667
Yeah. We should swing by one night and bust his chops.

500
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,539
Hey, yeah, we could keep sending back plate after plate

501
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,649
until he gets so angry he comes out.

502
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:14,612
Let’s make a plan.

503
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:16,987
Sure. Call me at the Independence Inn, that’s where we work.

504
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,425
- For now. 
- Sounds great.

505
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,647
- I’m so glad we ran into each other. 
- Me too.

506
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,859
And it was nice meeting you, Lorelai. Good luck with everything.

507
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:23,910
Thanks, you too.

508
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:25,419
I’m really glad we got a chance to catch up.

509
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:27,868
Oh, yeah. Hey, if you see Fat Sal, give him a kiss for me.

510
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,214
- I’ll do that. 
- Okay.

511
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:29,998
Bye.

512
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,618
Wait, so you and that guy knew each other, too? What a coincidence!

513
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,647
Come on, honey.

514
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,905
How many times do I have to tell them?

515
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:47,130
You can’t put a two-inch ladle of gravy into a one-inch potato crater.

516
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:51,155
You either need a smaller ladle or a bigger crater – otherwise, you get this.

517
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:52,709
- Gravy on your asparagus. 
- Yes. 

518
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:56,209
Paris, the cafeteria workers serve hundreds of students a day.

519
00:20:56,245 --> 00:20:57,648
A little gravy spillage is natural.

520
00:20:57,745 --> 00:21:01,401
I see. So I should just sit quietly and shovel in whatever slop

521
00:21:01,503 --> 00:21:03,673
they throw my way like some inmate in the chow line

522
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,343
at Leavenworth doing twenty to life?

523
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:06,434
I don’t think so.

524
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:08,006
I’ll save your seat.

525
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:38,327
They took my tray. I can’t believe they took my tray.

526
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,964
All I did was go up there and tell them I wanted some new asparagus,

527
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:42,111
and they took my tray.

528
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,414
Well, I also told them to buy a slightly looser hair net,

529
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:47,062
one that wouldn’t squish the part of the brain

530
00:21:47,134 --> 00:21:48,547
that can judge depth and measurements,

531
00:21:48,614 --> 00:21:50,221
and then they took my tray, but still...

532
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:52,551
Now what?

533
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,188
You gonna eat that?

534
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,140
Good, you’re here.

535
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:24,768
We need to talk.

536
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:27,472
We have three classes together, we couldn’t talk then?

537
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:28,757
I thought alone would be better.

538
00:22:29,524 --> 00:22:31,198
Besides, you picked the place.

539
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,310
What do you want?

540
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:34,871
- I want a truce. 
- Excuse me?

541
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,340
A truce, you know, no more fighty fighty.

542
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,296
I don’t believe you.

543
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:40,985
Look,

544
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:44,802
this is not the way I wanted things to work out, honestly.

545
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:46,797
Yes, the hemline thing bugged me,

546
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:49,607
and yes, Paris is not my idea of a secret sister,

547
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:51,748
but I never intended for things to go so far.

548
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:52,852
- No? 
- No.

549
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:54,666
I mean, it’s my senior year, too.

550
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:57,108
Why would I want to spend the whole time scheming and fighting?

551
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:58,235
It’s too exhausting.

552
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:00,297
I wanna stop this war, this vendetta,

553
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:03,769
this Sicilian thing. It must end.

554
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:05,275
This seems awful sudden.

555
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:07,138
Yes, well, my time is precious,

556
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:08,915
so if I’m not gonna truly commit to a grudge,

557
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:11,036
I’d like to move on and put that energy somewhere else.

558
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,515
Come on, what do you say?

559
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:14,881
Friends, sort of?

560
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:17,553
Friends... sort of.

561
00:23:18,352 --> 00:23:19,181
Shake.

562
00:23:29,018 --> 00:23:30,212
Stop doing that.

563
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:40,308
Okay, so you’ll come in early and set up the conference room

564
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,741
- for the group from Michigan. 
- Yes, I will.

565
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:44,195
Okay. Now, Sookie’s on top of the menu.

566
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:46,284
Let’s make sure the, uh, dining room’s open for a late lunch,

567
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:48,111
and we need to confirm the number of rooms they’ll need.

568
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:50,293
Yes, I have all of this written down on a notepad

569
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,771
right next to my self-help book,

570
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:53,873
"Why Don’t People Think You Know What The Hell You’re Doing?"

571
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:57,421
Sorry. I’m just a little stressed at this whole stupid deposition thing.

572
00:23:57,528 --> 00:23:58,853
Relax, it’s very easy.

573
00:23:58,993 --> 00:24:01,384
It is? You’ve done it?

574
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:03,422
- Once, it was nothing. 
- Why were you deposed?

575
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,281
My neighbor had this dog,

576
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:08,474
a frisky little scamp that used to love to yap to his friends all night long.

577
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,200
It was so cute. Then one day he disappeared.

578
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:12,752
I told the police what I knew,

579
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:16,894
but sadly the adorable little chatterbox was never found. It was tragic.

580
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,616
- You got rid of a dog? 
- No.

581
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,209
How could you get rid of a dog?

582
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:24,416
I will gladly show you the transcript from the lawyer

583
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:26,330
and the results of the lie detector test.

584
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:28,286
- You’re heinous. 
- And very well rested.

585
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:30,150
Lorelai, hi.

586
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:32,188
- Remember me? 
- Of course I do.

587
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:33,391
Nice to see you again, Joe.

588
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:34,902
This is a beautiful place you have here.

589
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,755
Ah, well, you know... keeps the rain off.

590
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:39,053
Right. So, is Sookie around?

591
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:41,876
Oh, yeah, she is. Right through there in the kitchen.

592
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:43,161
Thank you.

593
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:46,249
Here, give me those. I’ll file them with the rest.

594
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,450
Ah, stop that!

595
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:53,074
- Hey, I’ll just be a minute. 
- Oh no, don’t rush.

596
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:54,626
I was almost finished with the dinner prep,

597
00:24:54,718 --> 00:24:57,017
and then I changed my mind about two of the appetizers.

598
00:24:57,124 --> 00:24:58,695
Sounds like old times. Though, I gotta say,

599
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:01,050
this place is a long way from the sweatbox at the Deerhill.

600
00:25:01,153 --> 00:25:03,023
Yeah, we’ve upgraded a lot in the past few years.

601
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:06,525
We just got a refrigerated prep table and we replaced the two vertical mixers.

602
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:08,369
But you still got the old fifty-two inch Viking.

603
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:10,903
I know. I just like how big it is. I blew it up once.

604
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:14,656
But I had them rebuild it. I refuse to cook on anything else.

605
00:25:14,794 --> 00:25:17,113
- Stick with what you know. 
- Exactly. Taste this.

606
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:21,165
- Maybe a bit more brandy. 
- I knew you’d say that.

607
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:22,393
Well, people like brandy.

608
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:24,667
- You mean you like brandy. 
- And I’m people.

609
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:27,292
We always had a good time together, didn’t we?

610
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:29,582
- Yeah, it was a good group. 
- You always made it better.

611
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:32,290
‘Cause I kept you fools from driving off the side of a mountain.

612
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:33,294
Very true.

613
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,117
You know, I’m really glad we ran into each other.

614
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,961
- It’s not often you get a second chance. 
- What do you mean?

615
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:39,003
I can’t tell you how many times I kicked myself

616
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,596
for not asking you out that summer.

617
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:42,259
It just seemed like every time I got close,

618
00:25:42,337 --> 00:25:44,779
we’d end up talking about the best way to make calves liver or something.

619
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:46,290
Sautéed with caramelized onions.

620
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:48,696
Exactly. Then when I saw you at the Learning Center,

621
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,621
it was like fate was saying, "Here you go, man.

622
00:25:50,703 --> 00:25:51,936
Try not to screw it up again."

623
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:54,150
I guess things just had to happen in their own time.

624
00:25:54,277 --> 00:25:55,429
In their own time.

625
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:57,836
Could you just...

626
00:25:58,215 --> 00:26:00,472
stir... yeah, I’ll be back.

627
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:04,890
Oh, no, sir, I’m afraid we don’t offer a complimentary breakfast.

628
00:26:05,183 --> 00:26:06,217
He thinks it’s a date.

629
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,763
Yes, sir, I realize the Ramada does.

630
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,652
Lorelai!

631
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:13,227
Well, if you like, I could recommend a few places in town.

632
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:16,151
Okay... sure.

633
00:26:16,254 --> 00:26:18,132
Why don’t you talk to your wife and call me back.

634
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:19,690
Okay, bye.

635
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:22,285
Hey, Shields and Yarnell, what’s going on?

636
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:23,638
- He thinks it’s a date. 
- What?

637
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,293
- Joe, he thinks this is a date. 
- Is he crazy?

638
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:28,785
Exactly. You were there – it’s not a date, is it?

639
00:26:28,974 --> 00:26:31,872
No. The two of you were gonna go bust Feldster’s chops.

640
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,146
Busting chops is not a date.

641
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,400
That’s what I thought, but he keeps saying how he liked me back then

642
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:37,069
and how this is his second chance.

643
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:39,537
- He’s liked you for ten years? 
- Yes.

644
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:42,655
Wow. That is some serious Great Gatsby pining.

645
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:44,576
- I know. 
- You’re his Daisy.

646
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:46,470
I am? I’m his Daisy.

647
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,876
- I’m someone’s Daisy. 
- It’s very flattering.

648
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,231
It is very flattering. But I didn’t bring it on, did I? I mean, did I flirt?

649
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:54,354
No, you did not flirt. You were talking about Bung.

650
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:57,582
Right. And you can’t flirt when talking about Bung, it’s impossible.

651
00:26:57,698 --> 00:26:59,184
He read something into it because he wanted to.

652
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:01,252
Oh my God, what’s Jackson’s gonna say?

653
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:03,351
Sookie, it’s a misunderstanding. Jackson will be fine.

654
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,098
Just go in there and explain it to Joe.

655
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:06,214
But what do I tell him?

656
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:07,796
He’s waited ten years for this.

657
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,471
How do you hand out that kind of rejection?

658
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:11,652
I could tell him I’ve become a lesbian!

659
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:13,490
Yeah, or "I’m married" might work.

660
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,378
Right, I’m married, good, that’s very good.

661
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,205
It’s gonna be fine. Joe’s a nice guy with good taste.

662
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,853
- I’m his Daisy. 
- Be happy later.

663
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:21,760
Right.

664
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:22,952
I’m going in.

665
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:24,846
Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.

666
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:29,349
So, at the risk of seeming like Joe the drunken chef,

667
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:31,283
I added some more Port to the Cumberland sauce.

668
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:32,569
Now, just promise to try it.

669
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:33,884
Joe, we need to talk.

670
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:35,446
Wow, you’ve mellowed.

671
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,181
In the old days, you would’ve just called me an idiot and just dumped it in the trash.

672
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:41,032
It’s not that, it’s... you put in more Port?

673
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:44,314
This is a pheasant sauce, not the punch bowl at a frat party.

674
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,439
- Just try it. 
- No, no, no...

675
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:48,170
that’s not what I meant to say. It’s just...

676
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:50,731
there’s been a misunderstanding.

677
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:53,535
I thought this thing tonight was just a friends thing,

678
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:56,025
you know, not like a date thing.

679
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:58,432
Not that going out with you would be bad.

680
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,344
Except it would be... very, very bad.

681
00:28:01,855 --> 00:28:05,082
But only because I’m married! I meant to say that first.

682
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:07,433
See? Last May, I just...

683
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,045
Where’s my... oh, hang on.

684
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,062
See, this was supposed to be...

685
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:14,621
when I hold my hand up, ‘cause otherwise, "Whatcha doin’?", right?

686
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:18,631
Okay, here. I take it off when I’m cooking,

687
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:21,631
but, look, there it is, right where it should be, on my finger.

688
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:23,551
- You’re married. 
- Yes, I am.

689
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:25,558
I hope that’s okay.

690
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,862
Hey, if your husband’s good with it, who am I to complain?

691
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:29,899
- You’re not mad? 
- Why would I be mad?

692
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,386
Because you thought this was a date.

693
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:34,150
I’m not mad. Feeling a little stupid, but not mad.

694
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,922
Here, let me give you some money.

695
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:37,294
I didn’t spend any money.

696
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:39,301
Well, let me give you some money anyway.

697
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:40,545
Look, the only way I’ll be mad

698
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:42,630
is if you throw that sauce out before you try it, okay?

699
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:47,406
Tell you what, why don’t we make a plan to harass Feldman some other time?

700
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:49,855
You can bring your husband and I’ll see if I can get a real date.

701
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,503
That’d be fun.

702
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:53,644
Come on, I’ll walk you out.

703
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:54,498
You know,

704
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:56,977
we could even get some of the old gang together.

705
00:28:57,124 --> 00:28:57,985
I’ll drive.

706
00:29:00,428 --> 00:29:02,649
I guess this’ll teach me not to wait ten years next time.

707
00:29:03,296 --> 00:29:04,529
Anyway, I’ll give you a call.

708
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,619
Bye Joe.

709
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,938
See, he’s smiling.

710
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,411
I knew it was nothing to get worked up over.

711
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:13,623
You obviously let him down very well,

712
00:29:14,324 --> 00:29:16,680
and now maybe you guys can be friends.

713
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:17,873
I’m a whore!

714
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:22,076
This is silly. I know how to answer a question.

715
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:23,566
This is your first deposition.

716
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,185
Grandma’s lawyers just want you to be prepared.

717
00:29:25,353 --> 00:29:26,772
Sample questions, great.

718
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,783
It’s bad enough I have to give a deposition, now I have to study for it?

719
00:29:29,926 --> 00:29:31,601
- Shall we begin? 
- Go ahead.

720
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,806
Please describe how your mother runs her household.

721
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:37,289
Okay. Well, do you remember the rowing scene in Ben Hur?

722
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:39,272
- Mom. 
- I’m sorry, did that reference date me?

723
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:40,693
Should I have gone with the "Express Yourself" video?

724
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:41,421
Shall we stop?

725
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:43,381
Sorry, ask me another.

726
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:46,259
Would you say your mother is an easy woman to get along with?

727
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:47,360
No. Next.

728
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:48,630
You’re not taking this seriously.

729
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:50,570
I am taking this seriously.

730
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:51,815
You can’t say that.

731
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,826
Oh, wow, so you want me to lie.

732
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,296
No, you don’t have to lie.

733
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,314
It’s all about how you present the truth.

734
00:29:58,513 --> 00:29:59,998
For example, you could have said,

735
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:01,893
"My mother is a perfectionist."

736
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,816
And do you promise to visit Mommy in jail?

737
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:05,742
Yes, I do.

738
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,580
Okay, then. My mother is a perfectionist.

739
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,543
Very good.

740
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,937
Oh, hey. Where you going?

741
00:30:10,198 --> 00:30:13,152
Oh, well, I’m going to Doose’s because we are out of food.

742
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:14,304
How can you be out of food?

743
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:17,790
Well, it starts with the words, "Hey Jess, you do the ordering this week, okay?"

744
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:20,371
and it ends with me selling Kirk a lettuce sandwich.

745
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,180
We’ve eaten those.

746
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:23,623
I’m gonna go pick up some stuff to hold us over ‘til tomorrow.

747
00:30:23,715 --> 00:30:25,179
- Well, get some burgers. 
- And tater tots.

748
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:26,859
- And pickles. 
- Okay, hold on a sec.

749
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:29,301
Burgers, tater tots, pickles.

750
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:30,657
- You want cheese on the burger? 
- Cheddar.

751
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:31,933
- And swiss. 
- Dessert?

752
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:33,244
Do we have to decide right now?

753
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:34,626
I would seriously advise it.

754
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:35,917
- Pie. 
- Cherry.

755
00:30:36,393 --> 00:30:38,185
And whipped cream. And dental floss.

756
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:39,797
And paper towels. And People magazine.

757
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:41,452
We’re really hungry.

758
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:59,138
Paris, good, I so need to talk to you.

759
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:02,531
Are you lost?

760
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:08,799
Listen, first of all, I really wanna commend you on your job as president so far.

761
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:09,998
Thank you.

762
00:31:10,192 --> 00:31:12,997
The way you’ve negotiated on some of those convoluted school issues –

763
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:15,512
mind blowing. I watch in awe.

764
00:31:16,435 --> 00:31:18,404
And that’s why this is so hard,

765
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:20,709
because I have major respect for you,

766
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:24,247
and the last thing I ever want is for you to get the wrong impression about my loyalties.

767
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:25,313
What are you talking about?

768
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:28,502
These were shoved in my locker this morning,

769
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:30,816
and I didn’t know what to do, so I thought to myself,

770
00:31:30,935 --> 00:31:33,955
‘I’ll just show them to Paris and I’ll explain and she’ll understand.’

771
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:35,486
Explain what? What is this?

772
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:39,035
Rory came to me and said she wanted to talk about some things...

773
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:43,191
you know, policy, the prom, the senior gift, et cetera.

774
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:45,873
So of course I said, "why don’t we talk about them

775
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,670
at the student council meeting with Paris?"

776
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,928
And she said she wanted to do this without Paris.

777
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:52,848
She said Paris is just too wrapped up in that boyfriend of hers

778
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,316
to care about any of this. I didn’t know what to do,

779
00:31:55,427 --> 00:31:59,559
so I went, and then I found these, and I’m just so upset.

780
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:03,048
I mean, I would never intentionally do anything behind your back, Paris.

781
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,449
And I promise, the next time Rory tries to get me to,

782
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:08,101
I’m just gonna say, ‘Talk to the hand’, you know what I mean?

783
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:09,883
Yes, I know what you mean.

784
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,090
Are you mad? Say you’re not mad.

785
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:14,409
I just couldn’t live if I thought you were mad.

786
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:15,695
No, I’m not mad.

787
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:22,157
Well, thank God for that.

788
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:27,270
Okay class, we will begin in five minutes.

789
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,665
Does your helmet smell?

790
00:32:31,112 --> 00:32:32,478
I always get one that smells.

791
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:34,946
You’d think the brain trust behind P.E. could come up

792
00:32:35,014 --> 00:32:37,301
with some sport that didn’t give you helmet hair all afternoon.

793
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,366
- Like badminton. 
- Or striptease aerobics.

794
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,137
- What? 
- It’s really big in L.A.

795
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:43,303
You just go through the motions, you don’t actually have to strip.

796
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:45,079
Do the other people in the gym throw money at you?

797
00:32:45,177 --> 00:32:46,437
Fine, mock, but tell me this –

798
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:47,843
have you ever seen an overweight stripper?

799
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,656
The word no seems so wildly inadequate all of a sudden.

800
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:52,900
- Hey, where have you been? 
- Washing my hands.

801
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:55,894
All right everyone, take your places.

802
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:59,001
We will warm up with your counter-sixte-riposte-quarte.

803
00:32:59,252 --> 00:33:00,702
Melanie, please lead the group.

804
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:02,679
Oh my God, there’s a hair in mine.

805
00:33:02,945 --> 00:33:05,130
Just close your eyes and think of England, honey.

806
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:06,758
Doesn’t it seem strange to be practicing a sport

807
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,695
whose original purpose was to kill people?

808
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:11,859
It’s like if high schools of the future had teams in artillery

809
00:33:11,962 --> 00:33:13,769
or high altitude bombing or something.

810
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,823
Beginning salute.

811
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:16,888
En garde.

812
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:18,751
Right side advance.

813
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:19,826
You okay?

814
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:21,536
- Right side retreat. 
- Why do you ask?

815
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:23,282
- And lunge. 
- You just seem weird.

816
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:24,399
Left side advance.

817
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:27,292
- Easy there, Paris. 
- Left side retreat.

818
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,982
We’re fencing Rory, not playing patty cake.

819
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:29,934
And lunge.

820
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:31,685
You know, it’s interesting how you think you know someone.

821
00:33:31,783 --> 00:33:33,288
Right side, quarte lunge.

822
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,150
Trust a person, rely on a person, then turn around one day

823
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:37,988
and realize you’d been had. Ever experience that?

824
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:38,875
Ripost.

825
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,789
- Paris. 
- I hate being had.

826
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:41,818
Why are you telling me this?

827
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,102
You’re not supposed to be parrying that hard.

828
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:45,029
Gee, I’m sorry.

829
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,451
Maybe I should turn around so you can just stick it directly into my back.

830
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,478
- What are you talking about? 
- I saw the pictures.

831
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,373
- What pictures? 
- You know what pictures.

832
00:33:51,485 --> 00:33:52,776
Obviously I don’t know what pictures.

833
00:33:53,027 --> 00:33:55,208
- The pictures of you and Francie. 
- Me and Francie?

834
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:57,281
You and Francie in the parking garage talking about me.

835
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,935
- Paris, I... 
- Don’t make that face at me!

836
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:00,113
What face? I’m wearing a mask.

837
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,929
The "I’m Rory, don’t you want to pet me?" face.

838
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:03,524
I know you two have been meeting behind my back.

839
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,314
- We haven’t. We met once. 
- Aha, you admit it.

840
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:08,583
- Yes, but it wasn’t what you think. 
- Brutus!

841
00:34:19,923 --> 00:34:21,787
Paris, you have to listen to me.

842
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:24,420
Francie wanted to meet, she said she wanted to call a truce.

843
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,992
She took those pictures of us,

844
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:28,244
she’s setting me up, she’s trying to manipulate you.

845
00:34:28,377 --> 00:34:29,263
Of course she is.

846
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:31,368
You think I don’t know when someone’s trying to manipulate me?

847
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,306
But that doesn’t change the fact that you met with her behind my back.

848
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:37,138
I was trying to help you.

849
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,913
You were? You mean, in between betraying me

850
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:41,997
and selling me out, you were trying to help me?

851
00:34:42,244 --> 00:34:44,291
Gee, you are quite the Renaissance woman, aren’t you?

852
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,365
- Stop it! 
- Make me!

853
00:34:49,386 --> 00:34:50,333
Come back here, Gilmore!

854
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,736
Come back and fight like a man.

855
00:35:00,462 --> 00:35:03,322
And the worst part is, you told her about Jamie.

856
00:35:03,523 --> 00:35:06,215
I can’t believe I ever considered you my best friend.

857
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:16,892
I still can’t believe it.

858
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,659
I can’t believe I got sucked in like that.

859
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:20,159
That Francie is pure evil,

860
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:21,536
so she’ll probably wind up president.

861
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,001
Paris is so upset.

862
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,511
She totally thinks I betrayed her.

863
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,375
- She’ll calm down. 
- Paris has never calmed down.

864
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:27,347
She’ll calm down.

865
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,954
I can’t believe I was her best friend. I feel awful.

866
00:35:30,118 --> 00:35:31,055
Look, I’ll tell you what.

867
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,093
If you wanna make things right, just go back to school tomorrow

868
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,593
- and let her stab you. 
- Great idea.

869
00:35:34,808 --> 00:35:36,242
I’m nothing if not full of suggestions.

870
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:37,311
Or full of something.

871
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:39,109
- Hey Grandma. 
- Hi Mom.

872
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:40,149
Come in, it’s cold.

873
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:42,837
Do you want me to talk to her? You know, arrange a sit-down?

874
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:44,496
- No, thanks. 
- Come on.

875
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:46,426
We’ll have it in an Italian restaurant.

876
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:48,710
You’ll get up, go to the bathroom – thanks –

877
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:51,142
and come out shooting, and then I’ll send you to Italy.

878
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:52,426
I do wanna go to Italy.

879
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:54,147
Two birds with one stone, my friend.

880
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,286
Is everything okay, Mom?

881
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,186
Of course it’s okay. Why wouldn’t it be okay?

882
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,414
I don’t know. You just seem a little quiet.

883
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:03,399
Do I? I guess I do.

884
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:05,966
I don’t really have a lot to say, actually.

885
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:08,868
I know, why don’t I read to you instead.

886
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:10,216
What’s that?

887
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:12,069
This? Nothing, just your deposition.

888
00:36:12,223 --> 00:36:13,508
My... how did you get –

889
00:36:14,065 --> 00:36:16,186
Listen, it’s fun. Okay.

890
00:36:16,856 --> 00:36:19,708
"Question – Would you say your mother is a tolerant woman?"

891
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:20,660
Oh boy.

892
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:22,990
"Answer – Um, well, sure."

893
00:36:23,216 --> 00:36:24,577
What? I said you were.

894
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:25,715
You said sure.

895
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:27,102
Which to most people means yes.

896
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,222
Yes, to most people, it does, but I’ve heard you say sure,

897
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,881
and your sure is always sarcastic.

898
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:32,817
I do not have a sarcastic sure...

899
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:34,174
Do I?

900
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:36,354
Pick spot on carpet and stare.

901
00:36:36,472 --> 00:36:39,192
"Question – Why has your mother dismissed maids in the past?"

902
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,065
- Mom. 
- "Answer – Different reasons."

903
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:42,382
Well, that’s true, right?

904
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:43,599
"Can you expand on that?

905
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:46,713
Answer – Gee, how much time do you have?"

906
00:36:46,897 --> 00:36:47,789
Okay, see...

907
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:50,978
"I mean, if you guys have a lunch or an afternoon squash game or something...

908
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:52,806
you look like the kind of guys who play squash.

909
00:36:52,914 --> 00:36:54,491
And hey, why's it called squash?

910
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:57,302
Is it something to do with the fruit? Or vegetable, right?

911
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,652
A squash is a vegetable, though if you ask me,

912
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,066
it's gross no matter what you call it.

913
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:04,885
Well, anyway, what I'm saying is you might want to clear your afternoon."

914
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:07,958
I was flustered. He was using lawyer tricks.

915
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:09,279
By asking you to expand?

916
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:10,302
Now you decide to pipe in?

917
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:12,100
Didn’t I tell you this was important, Lorelai?

918
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:12,962
Yes, you did.

919
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,515
So, in spite of the fact that I told you it was important,

920
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:16,857
you couldn’t find it in your heart to put aside

921
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:20,130
your personal antagonism toward me for one day and help me out.

922
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,492
Mom, this is not fair.

923
00:37:21,597 --> 00:37:23,457
I said a lot of nice things about you in there.

924
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,492
Oh really?

925
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:27,434
"Would you say your mother sets impossible goals

926
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,622
which people cannot help but fail to reach,

927
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:33,575
thereby reinforcing her already formed opinion of their deficiencies?

928
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:35,821
Answer – Only for her daughter."

929
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,722
Okay, not there, but keep flipping.

930
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:40,031
I’m sorry to interrupt, but dinner is ready Mrs. Gilmore.

931
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,219
Dinner, hey! Dinner’s ready.

932
00:37:42,478 --> 00:37:44,573
Who’s hungry besides me?

933
00:37:46,774 --> 00:37:48,761
I’d keep it warm. We’re gonna be here awhile.

934
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:50,226
Okay, go ahead.

935
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,237
"Would you call your mother an extremely critical woman?

936
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,819
Long pause."

937
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:56,339
Why was there a long pause, Lorelai?

938
00:37:56,993 --> 00:37:59,959
Because I was deliberately trying to hurt you, Mom.

939
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,654
"On a scale from one to ten,

940
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:04,531
what would you rate your mother in terms of compassion for others’ feelings?"

941
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:05,802
Wanna guess what she said?

942
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:07,461
- No, thank you. 
- Mom.

943
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:10,687
Hang on a second, Lorelai. I just want to skip to the Ben Hur reference.

944
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,260
Yeah, I did.

945
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,166
Sookie, I’m home. I got the...

946
00:38:59,283 --> 00:39:00,880
- Surprise! 
- What is this?

947
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:03,800
- I made you dinner. 
- It smells terrific.

948
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,584
Lamb chops with Sicilian olives, rosemary and garlic,

949
00:39:06,728 --> 00:39:08,464
a warm potato and chorizo salad.

950
00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:10,885
I love lamb chops with Sicilian olives

951
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:13,759
and garlic, and a warm potato and chorizo salad.

952
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:14,471
I know.

953
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,734
- What’s that? 
- Beef jerky.

954
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:17,782
You made beef jerky for me.

955
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:20,389
And there’s cornbread, and fried marshmallow pie for dessert.

956
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:21,884
And you have CCR on.

957
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:23,058
Well, you like CCR.

958
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,647
I know I like CCR, you don’t like CCR.

959
00:39:25,816 --> 00:39:28,162
Sometimes I like CCR, and tonight I like CCR.

960
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,917
- You cheated on me! 
- No.

961
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,605
- Oh my God. 
- I just flirted accidentally!

962
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:35,679
- Turn it off. 
- Let me explain.

963
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,629
Every time I hear it now, it’ll remind me that my wife cheated on me.

964
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:40,327
Flirted – accidentally!

965
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:42,883
You ruined Creedence for me!

966
00:39:45,546 --> 00:39:46,502
I’m going to bed.

967
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:48,202
At nine-thirty?

968
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,333
Yeah, well, going a whole day without talking to anyone

969
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,659
is a lot more tiring than you think.

970
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:52,601
I hate those girls.

971
00:39:52,894 --> 00:39:56,119
It’s fine. It was the first lunch that didn’t start with a recitation

972
00:39:56,216 --> 00:39:57,962
of the calorie content of everything on the table,

973
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,385
so actually it was kind of a relief.

974
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:00,385
I hate them anyhow.

975
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:01,827
- Night. 
- Night babe.

976
00:40:09,446 --> 00:40:10,221
Hello?

977
00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:11,797
Lorelai, it’s Alex Lesman.

978
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:13,398
We met at The Learning Center the other day.

979
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,668
My friend accidentally asked your friend out on a date.

980
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:17,654
- Right, hi. 
- How are ya?

981
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:19,396
- I’m good. 
- Fat Sal sends his love.

982
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:20,656
Right back at him.

983
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:22,191
Look, I know this must seem kind of out of the blue.

984
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:23,615
You’re probably wondering how I got your number.

985
00:40:23,815 --> 00:40:24,783
Information?

986
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,635
No, that would’ve been far too logical.

987
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:28,909
I actually called your inn. I was gonna leave a message,

988
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:30,922
but this French guy just gave me your home number.

989
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,406
Said I shouldn’t worry about calling too late,

990
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:34,255
that you usually stay up ‘til three, four in the morning.

991
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:36,421
Yeah, don’t worry about him, he’s getting fired tomorrow.

992
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,389
So, what’s up?

993
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,955
Well, I was wondering something.

994
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:42,535
On weekends, I like to go to different coffee shops,

995
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:44,336
try their coffee, look at what they’re doing.

996
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:46,800
See if there’s anything you can steal and possibly disguise as your own?

997
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:49,463
Exactly, kind of a low-rent corporate espionage.

998
00:40:49,605 --> 00:40:53,072
Anyway, sometimes I’ll hit two coffee shops that have surprisingly similar product,

999
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:55,483
and I for the life of me cannot decide which one is better.

1000
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:56,994
- Bummer. 
- Yes, bummer,

1001
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:59,222
so I thought it would really help to have another person there

1002
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:01,244
who could help me make these crucial evaluations.

1003
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:03,732
Interesting solution to a fascinating problem.

1004
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:05,719
So I was wondering what you were doing this Saturday.

1005
00:41:05,884 --> 00:41:07,174
You know, it’s funny you should ask me this,

1006
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:10,020
because I just happen to be one of the world’s foremost coffee experts.

1007
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,033
Really?

1008
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:12,683
Oh, yeah, it’s basically just me

1009
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:14,341
and this guy named Chuckles in Brazil.

1010
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:15,442
Sounds like fate.

1011
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:16,682
So, what do you say?

1012
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:18,295
- Sure. 
- Great.

1013
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,998
Just to be on the safe side, you do know this is a date, right?

1014
00:41:21,142 --> 00:41:23,206
- Oh, yeah, I got that. 
- Good.

1015
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:25,494
So, you guys come up with a name for your place yet?

1016
00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:27,705
Right now, the top contender is Sludge.

1017
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,104
Excuse me?

1018
00:41:29,335 --> 00:41:31,417
Moving on, my partner likes Regular Joe.

1019
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:33,764
Then again, his name is Joe.

1020
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:35,218
Well, fancy that.

1021
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,772
So, still won’t let go of The Mudhouse, huh?

1022
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:40,061
Afraid not. What else you got?

1023
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:43,020
Well, okay, how about Black Liquid Hope Sold Here?

1024
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:45,903
See, now you’re making some progress.
