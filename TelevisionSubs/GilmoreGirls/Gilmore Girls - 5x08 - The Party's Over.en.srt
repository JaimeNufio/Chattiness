1
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:38,042
I smell meat, is that meat?

2
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,018
Why, yes, miss, it is meat.

3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,841
Oh, he called me miss. There's meat and a miss, I'm happy.

4
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:43,992
What's the occasion?

5
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,119
Well, I thought we might like some appetizers with our cocktails tonight.

6
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:49,169
Would we ever.

7
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:50,904
The first batch is ready, sir.

8
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:52,497
Wonderful, on the table please.

9
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:55,405
Mm, God it smells good.

10
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:57,617
- I love a good steak on a stick.
- Me, too.

11
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,622
- We should form a club.
- Steak-On-A-Stick club.

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,393
We could have t-shirts made up.

13
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:03,357
Grandpa, I've never seen you wear a t-shirt.

14
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,731
Well, I've just never found a proper occasion.

15
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:08,385
- Hmm. To the proper occasion.
- I'll drink to that.

16
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:10,919
I knew I smelled something, you're barbecuing!

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,764
So what?

18
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:16,074
So what? The agreement was the girls have drinks with you and dinners with me!

19
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:18,220
We are having drinks. Drinks and appetizers.

20
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:20,509
Those are not appetizers! Those are skewers!

21
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:22,864
- Little skewers.
- Little tiny skewers.

22
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:25,086
- This is not tiny!
- Mom, that's mine!

23
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:29,536
This is a main course and a cheap way of cheating me out of my dinner.

24
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:31,441
You are the most paranoid woman I've ever met.

25
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:32,695
I highly doubt that.

26
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:36,054
You were the one who designated the drinks portion of the evening to me.

27
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,834
- You love drinks.
- Drinks last one hour at most.

28
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:41,962
Then you get the dinner portion, which can last several hours.

29
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:44,717
Especially the way you structure things. You get more time.

30
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:48,091
I should at least be able to serve appetizers with my drinks.

31
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:51,347
Fine. I'll leave. Have you drinks and your appetizers.

32
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,439
You two better be hungry when you get inside, or else!

33
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:58,812
- Or else!
- Sounds serious.

34
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,989
- So, one more?
- Well, two more at the most.

35
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,483
Yeah, 'cause she was really mad.

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,623
- Something wrong?
- No, why, why?

37
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:13,788
- You're not eating.
- No, I am eating.

38
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,636
- You've taken two bites.
- Two really big bites.

39
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:19,124
- Rory's taken none.
- I did, you just missed it.

40
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,352
- You're full.
- No!

41
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:24,152
He can't stick to a simple agreement! He makes deals all the time in business,

42
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:27,506
but "drinks there, dinner here", somehow that's too difficult for him to manage.

43
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:29,620
- He was just...
- He was trying to upstage me.

44
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:33,179
He was trying to make his part of the evening the "fun" part. He's a child.

45
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,269
A spoiled four-year-old. I should take his dump truck away and send him to bed without supper.

46
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:41,222
- Or, as he calls it, appetizers.
- Mom, seriously, we are starving.

47
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,504
Look. Mmm, wow. Eat some carrots, eat some carrots.

48
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:46,392
Carrots. Delicious.

49
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,538
Well, if you're both that hungry, you must want more.

50
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:52,000
Olga! Good timing! The girls are famished. Load 'em up.

51
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,542
- Lorelai!
- What? It's not me!

52
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:57,314
It's me, Grandma. I'm sorry.

53
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:01,988
I have to take this. Promise I'll be quick.

54
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,062
Hello?

55
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:05,976
Hi. No, now's fine.

56
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,687
- Who's she talking to?
- How should I know?

57
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:10,283
Well, you're the one who taught her to leave her cell phone on at the dinner table.

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,958
That's for safety, Mom. In case someone forces her to eat five chickens and she has to call 911.

59
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,827
- She's talking to a boy, isn't she?
- I don't know.

60
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:19,776
She certainly sounds like she's talking to a boy. Does she have a new boyfriend?

61
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:20,395
Mom!

62
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:22,453
- Did she finally meet someone at Yale?
- I don't know.

63
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,738
Oh, of course you know!

64
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:26,281
Because I'm the one who taught her to leave her cell phone on at the dinner table?

65
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:28,238
Sorry, Grandma. That won't happen again.

66
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:29,544
That's all right.

67
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:32,320
So, who were you talking to?

68
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:33,549
Dean, you remember Dean?

69
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,888
- The boy who made you the car?
- Yep.

70
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:37,471
I didn't know you were still seeing him.

71
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:40,695
Umm, well, we got back together recently.

72
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,494
Really?

73
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:44,034
Well, that's a surprise, isn't it, Lorelai?

74
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:45,672
I know. I'm floored!

75
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:49,563
He's been working crazy shifts lately and I've had so much schoolwork

76
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:52,266
that we keep missing each other, so I told him to call me tonight.

77
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:53,434
Well thank you for telling me.

78
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:57,331
I'm just glad I got to hear it from you and didn't have to pick it up on the street somewhere.

79
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,084
'Cause you hang out on the street so often, Mom, you and Melrose Larry Green.

80
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,639
- So, are you happy with this Dean?
- Yes, I am.

81
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:07,494
Well, good. Now eat up, we have the fish course coming.

82
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:10,438
- Fish course?
- Yes, Olga makes a mean pickled herring.

83
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:13,224
Oh. Well. What a delightful skill.

84
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:18,666
Grandma's mean.

85
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,625
If it flew, swam or crawled on this earth we just ate it.

86
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:24,195
I can't breathe. Ow! What was that for?

87
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,474
- 'Cause you told my mother about Dean.
- What do you mean?

88
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:30,714
Well, I was totally covering for you with the phone call, and then you waltz back in and just tell her?

89
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:33,227
- My arm is swelling up!
- You were totally off the hook.

90
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:34,989
I was very skillfully covering for you.

91
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:38,420
Well, not skillfully, but there was a certain aplomb to my evasiveness.

92
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:41,092
I'm not going to lie to Grandma about Dean. Why should I?

93
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:42,065
Because she's her.

94
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:44,988
Mom, I am with Dean. She's already met him, Grandpa's already met him,

95
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,907
what is the problem besides this permanent welt on my arm?

96
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:48,992
All right, fine.

97
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:52,115
You know, I'm actually hungry.

98
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,262
We need to talk.

99
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:07,697
The man at table three wants to send an orange juice to the woman at table four.

100
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:08,885
As long as he's paying.

101
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:13,841
- If someone who wants to eat comes in here...
- I'm outie, I got it.

102
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:16,171
Hey, Lane.

103
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:17,969
Hi! Oh, potential hookup at table four!

104
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:21,014
Oh, wow, diner love. "Over easy" takes on a whole new meaning.

105
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,529
- Hey, Liz!
- Hey!

106
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,390
- I didn't know you were back!
- Yeah, just cruised in.

107
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,856
- Well how are you? How's TJ?
- He's great. He's gotten taller.

108
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:32,907
- I'm so glad to hear it.
- So you and my brother, uh?

109
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,282
- Yeah, well...
- I'm so jazzed. I want private details.

110
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,654
Tell her nothing.

111
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:40,690
Really, nothing? Not even about your Canadian mountie hat?

112
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,522
Liz, you have been sitting there for over an hour.

113
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,274
- I know. I'm almost done.
- Whatcha doing?

114
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,741
TJ and I are thinking about buying a winter place, you know,

115
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,963
something nice for when the Renaissance Fair season's over.

116
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,581
- You're moving to Stars Hollow?
- No.

117
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:54,920
Thinking about it. There's some great places for sale around here.

118
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:56,347
They're not for sale, they've all been sold.

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,018
Plus there's a few stores around here that are willing to sell my jewelry on consignment.

120
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:02,937
And I'd like a house, you know, with a fence and a lawn...

121
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,841
No lawns in Stars Hollow, we had them taken out.

122
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,766
Hey, how much did you pay for your house?

123
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:09,425
Oh, don't ask her that. You can't ask people questions like that.

124
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,094
- Why not?
- 'Cause you can't!

125
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:13,726
Don't tell her how much you paid for your house. You don't want to live here.

126
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,685
- Yes I do.
- It's too quiet for you.

127
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:17,785
- I like quiet.
- You do not like quiet.

128
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:22,655
TJ does not like quiet. He likes monster trucks, and baboons that get really mad at the zoo.

129
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,288
That's true, he does like that.

130
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,643
Luke, stop. You're going to like living so close to your family.

131
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:30,202
Yes, I've seen how much you enjoy living so close to yours. What can I get you?

132
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,969
Hmm. Nothing looks good.

133
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:33,433
- I'll make you a burger.
- I don't want a burger.

134
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,054
Make her your gumbo. Oh, he makes the most amazing gumbo.

135
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,674
- You make gumbo?
- And great Mexican food.

136
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:41,379
- Really?
- Makes his own tortillas.

137
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,662
Gotta make your own tortillas. The ones in the package are crap.

138
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:48,311
And garlic soup, and paella... He was really into lasagna for a while, got obsessed.

139
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:52,255
Made hundreds of lasagnas trying to find the perfect recipe. He wore an apron -

140
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:54,338
Okay! Liz, you don't even live here yet.

141
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:58,818
Fine. I gotta bail anyhow. TJ's meeting me at the realtor's office.

142
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,342
- Lorelai, it was great seeing you again.
- You too!

143
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:03,236
- Later, bro.
- Uh-huh.

144
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,022
- You've been holding out on me.
- What?

145
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,823
- Um, paella, gumbo, lasagna king?
- You know, I have many talents, okay?

146
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:15,637
I know. I mean, the way you keep that mountie hat perfectly balanced the entire time we're -

147
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:19,161
Okay, so, if you keep making mountie hat jokes, you're going to eventually believe

148
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:21,269
that there's an actual mountie hat.

149
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:23,416
Well, I'm very impressed. Or at least I would be,

150
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:26,906
if I had any proof of these extraordinary cooking skills of yours.

151
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:30,065
Okay. I'm going to cook you the most amazing meal of your life.

152
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,539
- This weekend?
- Stop making the mountie jokes and you're on.

153
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,710
- Deal. Blueberry muffin to go?
- You got it.

154
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:41,248
You're still picturing me in a mountie hat, aren't you?

155
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:43,976
- How do I look?
- Mm, I'll tell you this weekend.

156
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,800
You cannot put those flyers here!

157
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,213
I'm surprised that my mother told you that you could, but you can't!

158
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:54,832
So, go stand on a street corner like I had to do, ages six through fourteen!

159
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:56,552
Go!

160
00:08:57,627 --> 00:08:58,241
What?

161
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,683
- I'm so hungry.
- What?

162
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:06,075
It's flaxseed muffin month. Flaxseed muffin in the morning, flaxseed muffin at night.

163
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,364
I'm having trouble lifting my toothbrush.

164
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,798
Okay, come here.

165
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:12,195
- Not fast, please.
- Sit.

166
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,711
She made a lot of food with flaxseed. It lasts a very long time.

167
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:19,565
There.

168
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:21,312
- What's this?
- Fries.

169
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:24,789
But Mrs. Kim, she says that fries are the devil's starchy fingers.

170
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:27,768
They're hot and delicious and they don't have any flaxseed in them.

171
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:30,549
But they are a gateway food. They lead into harder things.

172
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:34,081
Pizza, movie popcorn, deep fried Snickers bar...

173
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,418
Oooh.

174
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,991
Oh, my.

175
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,257
Welcome to America.

176
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:47,753
So now I've got three days to do this comparative religion paper,

177
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,970
and the teaching fellow who runs our group spends all his time explaining to us

178
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,053
how much he disagrees with the professor, and - what are you looking at?

179
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,635
That guy over there is staring at me.

180
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,522
- Which guy?
- The one in the Santa Claus red sweater.

181
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:02,908
- Professor Prady?
- Shh! He'll hear you.

182
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:05,719
- You think Professor Prady is looking at you?
- He is more than looking at me.

183
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:08,673
God, this is so annoying. Ever since word leaked out about me and Asher,

184
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:11,058
every faculty member over fifty thinks I'm easy.

185
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,600
Paris, I don't think Prady's hitting on you.

186
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:15,569
You are so naive. He's practically licking his lips.

187
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:18,779
You sleep with one old guy, and suddenly you're Catherine Zeta-Jones.

188
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,331
- Hello?
- Rory, it's your grandmother.

189
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:26,936
- Oh, hey, Grandma.
- Your grandfather is here also.

190
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:30,049
- Hello, Rory. How are you?
- Fine, Grandpa, and you?

191
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:31,922
We're wonderful, thank you for asking.

192
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,605
Rory, we're sorry to bother you at school,

193
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:40,279
but next Friday your grandfather and I agreed to host a little Yale alumni event at our house.

194
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:42,215
It completely slipped our minds the other night.

195
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,164
So we'll have to cancel our usual Friday night dinner.

196
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,109
Oh. That's okay.

197
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:49,844
However, we were wondering if maybe you'd like to come.

198
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:50,447
Me?

199
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,951
The alumni always like to meet the next generation of Elis,

200
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:56,879
and plus, we'd love to be able to show you off to all of our friends,

201
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,624
- wouldn't we, Emily?
- Yes, we would!

202
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:02,223
You might even make a few connections that could come in handy somewhere down the road.

203
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:05,638
Please come! We'd hate to miss our weekly Rory fix.

204
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:07,845
And I promise you, there won't be any chicken.

205
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:09,064
Or steak on a stick.

206
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:11,665
Well, sure. I'd love to come.

207
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:14,087
Wonderful. Your grandmother and I are thrilled.

208
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:15,490
Is it fancy? What should I wear?

209
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,088
Oh, just pick out a pretty little dress.

210
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,529
- And bring that face.
- Well, the face comes with the package.

211
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:23,503
Oh, and I know you usually come at seven, but could you make it at six instead?

212
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:25,136
- Six is fine.
- We'll see you Friday.

213
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:26,109
See you Friday.

214
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:27,690
What's going on Friday?

215
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:29,709
My grandparents are having a party.

216
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:33,149
Damn it. Dean Treadwell just came in.

217
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,679
He's been throwing sex daggers out his eyes at me all week.

218
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:50,040
Chili fries, extra cheese and onions.

219
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:51,703
Thank you.

220
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:56,379
- Didn't you just say grace?
- Yes, but that was for the soda.

221
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:01,294
Kyon, tip, if you pray over every single thing you eat you might never be able to leave the table.

222
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:03,351
Breakfast will run into lunch which will run into dinner.

223
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:05,036
I'm telling God I'm thankful!

224
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,720
He gets it. Do a blanket thank you and move on.

225
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:12,071
We've got free passes to Tory's band on Saturday.

226
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:14,063
- No! Seriously?
- Totally seriously.

227
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,643
All we have to do is carry the equipment and we are in.

228
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,813
Okay, cool, you're jazzed. So I'll tell him it's a go?

229
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,754
- It's a total go.
- You free for dinner tonight?

230
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:24,078
- We'll discuss it when I get home.
- Okay. Bye.

231
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:28,927
- Ladies and gentlemen, I am in escrow.
- You're what?

232
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,310
- I am in escrow, I've got the paperwork to prove it.
- What is he talking about?

233
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:35,009
- We bought a house!
- Beautiful. White.

234
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:37,984
- You just started looking.
- I know, we bought the first home we saw.

235
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:38,860
Oh, Liz.

236
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:42,547
No, I'm telling you, I walked into this place, and just felt it.

237
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:43,740
- Felt what?
- The vibe.

238
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:47,481
That's right, she felt the vibe and now I'm in escrow.

239
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,545
Did you at least have an inspector look at this place?

240
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:51,794
Hey, we don't need some guy with a clipboard to tell us

241
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:54,875
what we already knew, which was this white house was for us!

242
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,594
Please don't be worried about this, the place is great.

243
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,019
It's on a corner, it's got room for a pool, it's air-conditioner ready,

244
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:06,154
it's landscaper ready, it's lawn ready, and it's got three bedrooms, if you build on two.

245
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:08,105
- It's got a roof, right?
- Of course it's got a roof.

246
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,164
And as soon as we replace it it won't leak as much.

247
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,468
- Just be happy, okay?
- Oh, sure.

248
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:15,919
That's right, buddy, smile, man, 'cause I'm in escrow!

249
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:18,888
Coffee! On the house! You like that, on the house?

250
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,813
You're paying for coffee for the entire diner?

251
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:23,251
What am I, made of money? I'm in escrow!

252
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:26,152
Throw in the coffee, buddy, we're celebrating.

253
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:28,154
I got it.

254
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:30,428
You're not really bugged we're moving here, are you?

255
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:34,770
- Does he even know what escrow means?
- I doubt it, but he's so happy.

256
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,605
I'm in escrow. Give it up, sister, I'm in escrow.

257
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:42,926
- So, you're off the hook.
- Off the hook, for what?

258
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:46,752
Friday night. Grandma and Grandpa are having a party for their Yale alumni friends.

259
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,352
- Really? This is news!
- So you're free as a bird.

260
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:53,463
Wo-ow, Friday night without my mother! I don't know if I can deal!

261
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:57,677
You might have to come over and force-feed me pickled herring and tell me what a disappointment I am.

262
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:59,884
- Hey, you want to go to the movies?
- Can't, I'm going to the party.

263
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,307
- What?
- They asked me to.

264
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:04,015
- Huh. Okay. I can get you out of it.
- Mom...

265
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:06,755
Whoop, hold on, just a moment. Let me formulate a plan.

266
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:09,013
I don't need to formulate a plan, I want to go.

267
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:11,736
You don't want to go, you feel obligated to go. That's very different.

268
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,836
Mom, they're giving the party together.

269
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:17,025
Ooh, I got it. Transfer to Harvard, then you won't be invited.

270
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,949
- Are you listening?
- Rory, they're just manipulating you.

271
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:23,759
Yes! Exactly! Them. Both of them, together.

272
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:26,359
They called me together. They were on the speakerphone together,

273
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:29,692
which means that they were in the same room, at the same time, together.

274
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:32,504
- So what you're saying is, they were together?
- Exactly!

275
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:35,335
- Whose antennae are up besides mine?
- Maybe they made up.

276
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,069
- They would have told us.
- They didn't tell us they broke up.

277
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:41,407
Yes, but that's because it looked bad. They didn't tell people I was pregnant 'till my eighth month.

278
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:43,953
My mother kept getting numbers for fat farms from her friends.

279
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:46,323
They sounded so happy. They sounded like they used to.

280
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:48,222
- Are you sure you want to go?
- I'm sure.

281
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,259
All right. Don't let Grandpa and his cronies make you sing Whiffenpoof songs all night.

282
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:52,964
I won't.

283
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:55,205
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to see you on Friday.

284
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,682
Well, how about I come by after? I can stay the night and then you can take me shopping on Saturday.

285
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,956
- Ah, the lucky girl.
- Okay. Bye.

286
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:08,093
Hey, Amir! Where's this month's Guitar magazine? I wasn't done reading it yet.

287
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,092
- You buy it, then you read.
- What kind of bogus system is that?

288
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:13,705
It's the bogus system called this is a magazine stand,

289
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:16,468
where people come to buy, not hang out and read for free!

290
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:19,014
That's a long freaking name for your bogus system, buddy.

291
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,923
You! You dirty, filthy devil boy!

292
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,040
You will pay for this. You will burn in hellfire for this!

293
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:29,111
You will swim in the sludge with Satan's hell-dogs, and feed them your innards for eternity!

294
00:15:29,173 --> 00:15:30,617
Ah, is this about the magazine?

295
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:34,672
She's an innocent girl. And you are a wild pig of filth!

296
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:37,785
I know! I know all you do! You think you can hide from me?

297
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:41,481
That you can carry on your dirty, filthy schemes without me finding out?

298
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:45,403
- I'm really, really lost right now.
- I heard about it! Kyon told me.

299
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:50,356
She told me about your hands on Lane. You put your hands on Lane!

300
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:54,036
My Lane! And before God, I swear that you will be punished.

301
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:58,566
Because that is what happens to all swine that walk up tall!

302
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:05,694
Okay. So, we have today for your dining pleasure a choice of sandwiches.

303
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,092
All fairly fresh, though slightly dented so as to afford me the eighty percent employee discount

304
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:12,273
that Taylor throws in with the paycheck.

305
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:14,612
He's a heck of a humanitarian, that Taylor.

306
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,305
Ah, we have a battered chicken salad, a bruised tuna salad,

307
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:27,418
a ham that survived the creamed corn assault of 2004, and something grey.

308
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,294
Toss that.

309
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:29,276
Gotcha.

310
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:33,301
Well, this is a very nice spread you've assembled here.

311
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,522
Well, when you're dating an Ivy League girl, you have to pull out all the stops.

312
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:41,417
- Chip pieces?
- Yes, please.

313
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:45,440
- I'm glad we got to do this today.
- Me too.

314
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,645
We haven't been able to see each other much lately.

315
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:52,347
Well, we're here now, right?

316
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:53,678
Yeah. Right.

317
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,628
- Hey, did you ever read my story?
- Which story?

318
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,812
The one about the Life and Death Brigade.

319
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:01,800
Uh, yeah, I did.

320
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:03,176
You like it?

321
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:06,797
I did like it. I like everything you write.

322
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,234
Do you think I painted the picture interestingly enough?

323
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:12,301
Because I tried to be objective, to a certain extent,

324
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:16,822
but it is a feature piece, so I wanted to have some human spark, you know?

325
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:17,984
I thought it was good.

326
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:20,954
- Nothing specific, though?
- Hey, you're the writer.

327
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:25,094
I can't critique these things. I just know that I read it and I was interested.

328
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:27,025
Well that's what counts.

329
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,920
- Okay, so, let's talk about tonight.
- Let's talk about tonight.

330
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,597
Okay. I'm going over to my grandparent's at six.

331
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:39,442
I figure I'll go in, make the rounds, say hello, eat a cheese puff,

332
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,078
then you can meet me outside the house at eight-thirty

333
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,300
and we can hit a movie in Hartford or something.

334
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:48,179
I don't want you ducking out of your grandparent's party early if it's going to be a big thing.

335
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,270
Hey, don't you want to get together with me?

336
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,812
- You know I do.
- Okay then.

337
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,121
No more talk, it's settled. Eight-thirty, out front,

338
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:56,866
I'll be the one in the party dress with the jeans and a purse.

339
00:17:57,357 --> 00:18:01,561
I'll have to take a pretty big purse, but desperate times call for desperate actions.

340
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,759
- Deal?
- Deal.

341
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:04,028
How long have we got?

342
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:06,849
Uh, fourteen minutes till my lunch break's over.

343
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,242
Okay then. Cheers.

344
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:14,941
- Bonjour.
- What's all this?

345
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:18,334
This is as close as you're going to get to me cleaning up tonight.

346
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,333
- Hi.
- Hi.

347
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:25,483
Man, something smells crazy good in here. Oh my God, what are you making?

348
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:29,204
Lamb and artichoke stew, penne with pesto and potatoes,

349
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:34,304
roasted garlic with rosemary focaccia, tomatoes stuffed with bread crumbs and goat cheese,

350
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:38,474
and ricotta cheesecake with amaretto cookies to go with your coffee.

351
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:40,255
- You're the perfect man.
- Thank you.

352
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,192
I used to think it was Kelsey Grammer, but it's not. It's you.

353
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:45,908
Finally, I'm one-upping Grammer. You want some wine?

354
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:46,730
Yes, please.

355
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:54,549
Okay, so I brought a little ambience and a little Clooney.

356
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:55,229
George?

357
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:56,228
Rosemary.

358
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:59,556
Oh my God, this is so great.

359
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:02,255
I mean, besides the fact that it's an evening of you,

360
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,209
it's also the first Friday in many many moons that I'm not at my parent's house

361
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,295
and that knowledge is giving me a really warm, fuzzy feeling right about now.

362
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:13,968
Meaning that if, by some chance, your meal winds up sucking, I might not even notice.

363
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,677
Excellent to know. To the warm and fuzzies.

364
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,432
- Perfect.
- Oh, I'm down to the artichokes.

365
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,233
You know, it may have choked Artie, but it ain't going to choke me.

366
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,851
Some Little Rascals humor there for ya.

367
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:28,494
- I know.
- You know?

368
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:30,999
You are the perfect man.

369
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,531
Just move them so people can navigate around them comfortably.

370
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:38,719
Not that far apart, not that far apart! Good Lord, if someone needs that much room

371
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:41,254
to get around a chair they shouldn't be at a party, they should be on a treadmill.

372
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:42,862
- Hey, Grandma.
- Rory!

373
00:19:43,035 --> 00:19:46,850
Oh, look at you! Will you look at her?

374
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:50,203
I said look at her! Isn't she beautiful?

375
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:51,990
Yes, very beautiful.

376
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,613
I love this dress, very elegant!

377
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:58,319
- Thanks, Grandma. The place looks wonderful!
- Oh, there's too much blue.

378
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:00,485
It's Yale alumni, there can't be too much blue.

379
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:05,090
Emily, I noticed the bartenders weren't planning on using proper martini glasses.

380
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:08,570
Well, Rory, how lovely you look tonight.

381
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:10,966
Doesn't she? This dress is divine.

382
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:14,464
But you know what? My hairdresser's upstairs in my bedroom right now,

383
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,997
why don't you go on up and have here do a little something with your hair?

384
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,517
- My hair?
- Just for kicks.

385
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:21,744
- Come on, I'll take you up. Richard, could you...
- I have it all under control.

386
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,768
Thank you. Come on!

387
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:28,983
Oh, you're home. Do you want to talk about dinner?

388
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:32,445
Um, sure, or about how your mom totally attacked me today.

389
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,116
What?

390
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:36,914
I'm standing out on the street in broad daylight, and, like, out of nowhere, bam!

391
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:41,496
- She was in my face, crazy and screaming!
- Zach! Slow down, I don't understand.

392
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:44,088
She cursed me, Lane! What's not to understand?

393
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:49,069
She went on and on about burning in hellfire and swimming in Satan's sludge,

394
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:52,443
and hell-dogs eating me, and I gotta tell you, it sounded bad.

395
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:55,003
- I don't understand. Why would she?
- 'Cause she knows, okay?

396
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,958
She knows everything! She sees everything, you know that.

397
00:20:58,045 --> 00:20:59,314
She doesn't know everything, Zach.

398
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,807
Well, she knows about you and me, and she's sending me to hell for it,

399
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,677
and I've got to tell you this is not cool. This is not rock and roll.

400
00:21:04,757 --> 00:21:07,046
- I know, I'm sorry.
- I don't do parents.

401
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:11,173
I'm not that guy. Nobody brings me home to Mom for a reason, okay?

402
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:15,893
I'm a total backseat, in the closet, jump out the window dude, all the way.

403
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,301
I just don't understand how she found out. I mean, it's not like she's ever seen us together, or...

404
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:22,262
I know who told her.

405
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,451
I can't do this crazy scary short chick screaming at me on the street.

406
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:31,431
Zach, I'm sorry. I promise, it will never happen again! I will take care of it.

407
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:33,250
What about the hellhounds?

408
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,851
I will take care of the hellhounds too.

409
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:39,470
'Cause Hellhounds is a cool band name but the positive imagery stops there.

410
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:42,226
- I got it. It's done.
- Okay. Fine.

411
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:44,770
I've gotta go walk by a church or something.

412
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:49,174
- Hey, this is the same stuff from the diner.
- Yep.

413
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:52,005
- Pilfering silverware from the diner!
- It's my diner.

414
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:56,055
Yes, but it's wrong. You should have boundaries in your life, leave work at work.

415
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:58,947
You need a work life and a home life and the silverware is your work life.

416
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,863
I'm so telling Dr. Phil on you.

417
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:05,021
Luke! You in there? Open up! Luke!

418
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,670
- What the...
- You're home! Good!

419
00:22:10,022 --> 00:22:12,814
- Don't come in!
- Your sister, Luke. Your sister.

420
00:22:12,922 --> 00:22:14,237
TJ, this is really...

421
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,026
Do you know how many people told me not to get married? They said women make you crazy,

422
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:21,737
they burrow in your head and you can't get them out!

423
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:24,855
- Women suck! Oh, hey, Lorelai.
- How are you doing, TJ.

424
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:29,346
- I'm assuming you guys had a fight.
- Not just a fight, a whammo monster of a fight.

425
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:32,490
It was like Jake Lamotta and I was that blonde chick he was married to.

426
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:36,303
- You'll make up. Bye.
- I mean you'd think I took a shot at the Pope,

427
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:39,903
the way she talked to me. I'm sorry, I didn't hear her when she asked for the beer,

428
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:42,667
and preset station numbers are there for a reason!

429
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:46,114
Okay, look at the table and the candles, okay? This is not a good time.

430
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:49,918
- You're telling me? I'm in escrow!
- Okay. Hold on. Go stir the sauce.

431
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,652
- Me? But, I can't cook.
- It's not cooking, it's stirring.

432
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:56,798
No, I'm not good with big spoons, unless there's ice cream on the end - okay.

433
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,957
TJ, what is this all about?

434
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,688
She's crazy, man, she goes nuts! And she yells at me like...

435
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:09,881
there's a register that her voice reaches when she yells that only a freaking dog can hear,

436
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:14,167
but her face is so twisted and contorted that you know she's hit that register,

437
00:23:14,238 --> 00:23:17,756
and it's amazing! It should be on the Discovery Channel or something.

438
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,413
Um, excuse me. How fast am I supposed to be stirring here?

439
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:25,201
Just keep it from sticking. I am really sorry you had a fight, but you're married now.

440
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:28,891
You can't run out every time you have a disagreement. Now, go on back.

441
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:30,474
- I can't go back!
- TJ!

442
00:23:30,555 --> 00:23:33,980
- I'm not ready, it's all too fresh!
- It's bubbling and turning brown.

443
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,414
- It's fine.
- Well, what constitutes sticking?

444
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,994
- You can't ruin it.
- I can, I have powers.

445
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,967
Once the Barefoot Contessa was making a souffl� and when it fell,

446
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,553
she looked out the TV and said, Gilmore, was that you?�

447
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:47,256
- You've gotta go, man!
- Just let me hang out here.

448
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,762
- No!
- Just for a little while!

449
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,361
Right in here, in the corner. Very quiet. You won't notice me at all.

450
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:53,879
Churchmouse, buddy.

451
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,941
- I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome.
- I got it.

452
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,397
He just needs a minute.

453
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:18,899
Oh, yes, that's very nice. I love the lashes.

454
00:24:18,982 --> 00:24:21,885
- Grandma, this is really nice, but -
- Just a little more cheeks.

455
00:24:21,988 --> 00:24:23,739
Shouldn't we be getting down to the party?

456
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:25,940
Yes. One more minute now.

457
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:31,127
Let's see here, this might do it.

458
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:32,684
Grandma, I couldn't...

459
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:38,422
Diamond necklaces were invented to be worn, they're doing nobody any good just sitting in a box.

460
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:40,148
Perfect, do you like it?

461
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:43,798
- Well, yes it's beautiful, but...
- It needs earrings! I agree!

462
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:46,517
No, it's fine on it's own, really!

463
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:50,245
Your grandfather bought me these earrings on our first trip to Denmark.

464
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:53,301
He swears he bought them off the ne'er-do-well brother of the king

465
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:55,329
who stole them from the queen - have you ever heard such a thing?

466
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:56,123
No.

467
00:24:56,222 --> 00:25:01,862
Ah, I have a wonderful idea! Have you ever worn a tiara?

468
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:03,977
Well, when I was four...

469
00:25:06,624 --> 00:25:08,190
You look like a princess.

470
00:25:08,698 --> 00:25:12,547
Grandma, are you sure you want me wearing all this stuff?

471
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:15,912
They must be very expensive, and if something should happen...

472
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,596
Nothing's going to happen, and yes.

473
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:21,733
You look exactly the way I want my granddaughter to look to all our guests. Shall we?

474
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:24,410
- Okay.
- It's going to be a wonderful evening.

475
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:31,769
Everyone, here's Rory!

476
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:37,846
- You look absolutely royal.
- Well, it's probably the crown.

477
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:40,877
- Emily, you did a fine job.
- Thank you, Richard.

478
00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:45,378
Oh, uh, Rory, I'd like you to meet Min and Argus Head and their son Andrew.

479
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:47,001
Andrew, this is my granddaughter Rory.

480
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,541
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

481
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:50,764
Andrew will be at Yale Law next semester.

482
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,194
- Isn't that wonderful?
- It is, especially if you want to be a lawyer.

483
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:59,192
Well, we need to make the rounds. You two can talk more later.

484
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:00,672
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

485
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:04,383
Rory, we'd like you to meet Deanna and Chase Anderson and their son Donnan.

486
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:05,883
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

487
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:08,378
Donnan is going to run his father's shipping business one day.

488
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:12,006
Our own Aristotle Onassis with infinitely better table manners.

489
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,431
Nothing's written in stone yet.

490
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:15,909
We'll see what kind of pension plan the company has, and then...

491
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:21,233
Rory's going to be a journalist. Take the world by storm, the two of you should talk later.

492
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:22,820
- Definitely.
- Okay, well...

493
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:27,229
Oh, Rory, Bunny and Napoleon Barnes and their son Kip.

494
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,569
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi, Kip. It's nice to meet you.

495
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:31,582
Kip is captain of the polo team.

496
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:34,253
Hell of a player. Give those Windsor boys a run for their money.

497
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,888
William and Harry are good guys. Decent horsemen, terrible bridge players.

498
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:42,887
Um, Kip, will you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to my grandparents.

499
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:44,760
It was nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Barnes.

500
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:46,971
- Make sure you two talk later.
- Yes, ma'am.

501
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:49,737
- Yes, Rory?
- Are you enjoying the party?

502
00:26:49,853 --> 00:26:52,102
The party is very nice, Grandma. I was just wondering,

503
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,026
do your alumni friends have any daughters?

504
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,526
Daughters? What do you mean?

505
00:26:56,638 --> 00:27:01,917
Well, I was just noticing that there are a lot of boys here but not that many girls.

506
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:05,753
Really? I hadn't noticed. Did you notice, Emily?

507
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:08,743
Why no, I haven't. Huh, well.

508
00:27:08,814 --> 00:27:11,737
I will have to pay more attention to the guest list next time, won't I, Richard?

509
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:12,706
Yes, you will.

510
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:16,080
I promise you, we will throw another party just for our friends with girls.

511
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:18,639
- But in the meantime...
- Ah, the Campbell boy is here.

512
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:21,455
Oh, good, let's go. Campbell, like the soup!

513
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:28,034
Oh my God, this is good. I mean this is seriously good.

514
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:29,056
Glad you like it.

515
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:32,033
How you doing, TJ?

516
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,655
I just need a minute.

517
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:38,049
- He said that thirty-five minutes ago.
- Well, he's not crying now, so...

518
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:40,585
- I want him to leave.
- I know. He will.

519
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,189
Sure there's nothing I can do for you?

520
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:45,787
Just thirty seconds. That should do it.

521
00:27:46,092 --> 00:27:47,828
Would you like something to eat, TJ?

522
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:49,959
Why are you asking him if he wants something to eat?

523
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:52,257
He's been sitting there for half an hour, he might be hungry.

524
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:54,802
He said thirty seconds. You're going to make the thirty seconds go longer.

525
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,947
- TJ, we've got plenty.
- That's very kind of you, Lorelai.

526
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:01,100
I appreciate it. Being in escrow and everything.

527
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:03,266
But I don't want to interrupt your evening.

528
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:07,264
As soon as I gather myself I'll be going. Ten more minutes?

529
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:14,268
Look, you can go A.M.G. but you're still going stock Mercedes.

530
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:19,117
Okay, are you seriously knocking 493 horses at 6100 rpm�s

531
00:28:19,173 --> 00:28:22,477
coming out of a 5.5 litre, 24 valve V-8?

532
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:24,710
Okay, well, let's say you go with the SL-55.

533
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:28,016
Um, I'm sorry. Would you all excuse me for just a...

534
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:31,676
Yeah, sure. So the SL-55. Look, at least go aftermarket on its ass.

535
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,545
I told you.

536
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:50,508
You told me what?

537
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,688
Whatever has happened at that party you got rooked into tonight. I told you.

538
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,613
Do you want to hear or do you just want to gloat?

539
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:57,026
Well, I'm a multi-tasker.

540
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:59,878
So I get here, and Grandma immediately whisks me upstairs

541
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,483
where her hairdresser and makeup artist are waiting to make a new me.

542
00:29:03,554 --> 00:29:04,967
'Cause the old you was so last season.

543
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,023
Then I come downstairs to find that the guests are all Yale friends

544
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,379
of Grandma and Grandpa's and their sons.

545
00:29:10,503 --> 00:29:13,887
- What?
- No girls! All boys, and me!

546
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,606
- You're kidding.
- Nope. I feel like I'm being auctioned off.

547
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:19,780
- They suck, my parents suck.
- This is a very silly picture.

548
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,649
They know you're with Dean, 'cause by the way you told them.

549
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:23,544
It's okay, I just thought you'd like to know.

550
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,680
- Do you have a pencil?
- Why?

551
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:27,607
'Cause there are twelve ways out of that house that they don't know about.

552
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:31,239
Write this down. First, the basement. It's a little dusty, but almost foolproof.

553
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,900
If you can't get there, grab a screwdriver

554
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:36,395
and jimmy the back of my mother's closet. There's a false back.

555
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,249
- Mom...
- And if they haven't trimmed the trees yet,

556
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:42,201
the second guest bathroom window opens out onto the massive elm

557
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:43,424
and you can shimmy right down.

558
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:46,045
I am not going to shimmy. I don't need to sneak out, it's fine.

559
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:48,827
Dean is picking me up at eight thirty, I can manage till then.

560
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:51,093
- They played you, kid.
- Yeah, I know.

561
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,387
- I hate that they did that.
- Well, it's done.

562
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:56,818
Okay, I should go. In this crowd they will definitely notice me missing.

563
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:58,405
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, hun.

564
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:02,363
- What's the matter?
- Nothing a little patricide won't solve.

565
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,397
Oh, hello, I'd like to speak to Richard or Emily.

566
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:10,181
- Que?
- I'd like to speak to Richard and Emily Gilmore.

567
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:11,215
No comprendo.

568
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:15,470
Is there someone there who speaks English? I hear English in the background.

569
00:30:16,443 --> 00:30:18,297
Oh, right there! I heard the word salmon.

570
00:30:18,353 --> 00:30:20,839
Could you pass the phone to the person who said "salmon"?

571
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:25,819
- Is he here?
- Yes. Get him out, please!

572
00:30:27,073 --> 00:30:29,776
Emily Gilmore. Senora Emily Gilmore?

573
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:33,058
- TJ, come on, let's go.
- I cannot deal with you right now.

574
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,115
- You can't just barge in here like this.
- I did not barge!

575
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:39,519
- Do not accuse me of barging!
- You are ruining their evening!

576
00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:42,637
No, I am not! I'm just sitting here, I'm not saying anything!

577
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,725
Okay, you two just go downstairs and talk! Please!

578
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:47,757
You are unbelievable, you know that?

579
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,585
I do, as a matter of fact.

580
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,007
I hadn't even come out of the bedroom and you'd gone!

581
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:54,736
I wasn't gonna stick around so you could yell at me!

582
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,366
Okay! This is enough!

583
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:59,529
The both of you just have to shut up right now, I've got neighbors!

584
00:30:59,611 --> 00:31:01,467
- You don't even have your shoes on!
- I've got shoes on!

585
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:03,050
You've got my shoes on!

586
00:31:03,164 --> 00:31:07,204
Oh, so I guess all that "what's mine is yours" was just a bunch of crap also!

587
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:11,571
You know what? I am fed up with you and the drama, I can't take it!

588
00:31:11,673 --> 00:31:15,108
My head's going to explode from all your freaking scenes and your tantrums!

589
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,807
- My tantrums?
- I cannot look at you.

590
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:20,977
Liz, what are you - Go get her out of there!

591
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:25,292
Nope, that's exactly what she wants!

592
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:27,504
Okay, never mind. I'll call back. Bye.

593
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:29,551
- TJ!
- Damn.

594
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,356
I had almost gotten myself together. Now I have to start all over!

595
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:35,651
- She's in the bathroom.
- Okay.

596
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:38,272
You go try to calm him down and I'll go see if I can talk to her.

597
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:40,361
You were right. Having family near is fun!

598
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:43,470
Rory?

599
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,960
I'm Jordan. Your grandmother sent me over here.

600
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,253
Apparently we're made for each other.

601
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,085
Oh, gee. Well, how convenient.

602
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:54,932
There's nothing like having your family play matchmaker.

603
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,497
- How old are you?
- Me? I'm, um, almost twenty.

604
00:31:58,578 --> 00:32:00,753
All right, good. Just making sure everything's legal.

605
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:03,540
- You need a drink?
- No, not a drink.

606
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:07,133
- Why? Get a little crazy when you drink?
- Yes. That's it.

607
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:10,938
- I'd like to see that.
- Rory. There you are, I've been looking everywhere for you.

608
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:13,697
I'm late, I'm sorry, don't be mad. Logan Huntzberger.

609
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,072
- Uh, Jordan Chase.
- Good to meet you, thanks for keeping my girl busy.

610
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:19,391
If you hadn't, she would've noticed exactly how late I am

611
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:22,044
and then she mighta left and that would have been very, very bad.

612
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:26,032
- Excuse me, I'm sorry - you're with her?
- Going on a year and a half.

613
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:29,237
Great. What the hell am I doing here?

614
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,743
- Oh, thank you.
- You looked cornered.

615
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,992
- I was.
- Well, glad to be of service.

616
00:32:35,297 --> 00:32:38,447
- Man, I hate these parties.
- Not really my bag either.

617
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,730
But at least the bar is stocked, and I must say your grandmother has excellent food.

618
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:43,287
Wait, my grandmother?

619
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:47,275
- Logan? How are you, son?
- I'm very well, sir, and yourself?

620
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:50,393
Oh, I'm fit as a fiddle! It's good to see you. Are your parents here?

621
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:53,298
Wandering around here somewhere. Mom is obsessed with Emily's new draperies.

622
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,332
Ah, yes. Emily has exquisite taste in fabrics.

623
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,871
All right, Rory. Since I see that you are in capable hands

624
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,220
I will make another round and end up at the bar.

625
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:04,251
- It's been good to see you, Richard.
- Good to see you, Logan.

626
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:07,146
You know my grandparents.

627
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:09,090
My folks are good friends with Richard and Emily.

628
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:14,666
Okay, so. Lesson One in coping with painfully boring parties, form a sub-party.

629
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:16,479
- Where are you going?
- Finn!

630
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:18,722
- Finn's here?
- Finn!

631
00:33:20,023 --> 00:33:22,025
- You rang?
- Time for a change of venue.

632
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:23,294
Oh, fantastic.

633
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:25,742
Do I know you?

634
00:33:32,294 --> 00:33:33,308
Is my mother here?

635
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:35,511
No, she's at Mrs. Cho's house.

636
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:39,299
Mrs. Cho thinks that she lost some weight, and Mrs. Kim went to give it back to her.

637
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:42,125
Good. Why did you rat me out to my mother?

638
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,865
- Rat you out?
- You told her about Zach.

639
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:46,165
The boy you hugged?

640
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:50,235
Yes! You told her, I'm just a little mystified as to why you would do that.

641
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,069
Mrs. Kim has taken me in.

642
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:55,740
No, I took you in. You came to me, starving, and I gave you fries.

643
00:33:55,822 --> 00:33:57,845
- You did like the fries, right?
- Very, very much.

644
00:33:57,901 --> 00:34:00,885
Okay, so that is we what we call in America a bonding thing.

645
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:04,720
I gave you the fries and you are not supposed to tell on me to my mother!

646
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,879
- What am I supposed to do?
- Nothing. You say nothing, you do nothing.

647
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:09,492
- But she would know!
- She would know what?

648
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:13,348
She would know I lied, she would know I'm ungrateful and I keep a secret from her!

649
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:14,607
- How would she know?
- She know!

650
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,132
No, she no know! She is not magic!

651
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,031
Yes she is! She read thoughts and hand gestures!

652
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,543
Come here.

653
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,635
If you want, I can help you.

654
00:34:26,742 --> 00:34:27,628
Help me?

655
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:29,808
What do you do every Sunday between noon and four?

656
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:30,910
- I study.
- And then?

657
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:36,018
And then I wait for Mrs. Kim to get home from her Crochet for Christ group with her sister.

658
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,010
Okay. And what do you do while you're waiting?

659
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,931
Nothing. I sit quietly.

660
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:42,774
Okay. Now wouldn't you rather, let's say, watch some television

661
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:44,093
while you're waiting for my mother to get home?

662
00:34:44,155 --> 00:34:45,501
- Oh, I cannot!
- Why?

663
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:47,815
Mrs. Kim does not want me to watch the television!

664
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:48,738
And how would she know?

665
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:53,176
Because, there's a little machine in the television set that will tell her what I watch!

666
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:54,621
- Ha!
- What ha?

667
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:58,072
- That machine does not exist.
- It does not?

668
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,667
Nope. It took me fifteen years to figure it out, but that's the truth.

669
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:02,035
So she cannot know?

670
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,633
She also cannot smell fast food on you even after you've showered.

671
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:06,411
She can't?

672
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,165
And she can't tell how many times you've opened your bible by staring at your palm.

673
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,270
My head spins!

674
00:35:11,374 --> 00:35:14,558
And you don't have to hand out all those religious flyers she gives you.

675
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:18,219
Just post enough of them around here regular route home and she'll think the job is done.

676
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,745
I think I need to lie down.

677
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:23,036
It's a whole new world, Kyon.

678
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:25,618
A world I fought long and hard to figure out

679
00:35:25,672 --> 00:35:28,782
and I'm willing to pass all my knowledge on to you.

680
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:35,079
So, I can eat fries, watch TV if I get home early from not giving out my flyers?

681
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:38,474
I wouldn't bring the fries into the house. She has a really good nose.

682
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,034
But you're thinking big, and I respect that.

683
00:35:41,796 --> 00:35:43,663
I can watch the TV!

684
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:47,107
Stick with me, kid, and I'll have you wearing lip gloss within a month.

685
00:35:48,803 --> 00:35:52,277
Emily and Richard Gilmore! Oh, come on!

686
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:54,801
I know you speak English. I heard you yell "salmon" earlier.

687
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,281
My mother put you up to this.

688
00:35:58,057 --> 00:35:58,852
Fine.

689
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:02,082
What are they doing in there?

690
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:04,263
Um, fighting?

691
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:06,987
And how long can you fight in an eight by ten room?

692
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,987
Well, maybe they're not fighting. Maybe they're having angry make-up sex.

693
00:36:10,054 --> 00:36:12,337
Now that makes me feel much better, thank you.

694
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:16,377
- Sorry about dinner.
- Aw, dinner was great.

695
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:18,477
It was delicious and interactive...

696
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,013
Okay, I don't know how long this is going to continue.

697
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,726
Well, we could set fire to the place. Smoke 'em out.

698
00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:29,136
Listen, you don't have to sit here. I'll deal with this. You go home.

699
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:30,257
Are you sure?

700
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,895
Yep. They are my family. Yippee. I'll deal with it.

701
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:42,924
You take this and go home, and we will try again tomorrow.

702
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:49,315
Wow! My own cheesecake. No man's ever given me a whole cheesecake before.

703
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:50,344
You remember that.

704
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,799
Hey, maybe when I get home I'll stir something, seeing as I'm so good at it.

705
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:56,621
Thanks for dinner.

706
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:06,949
Thank you for not being related to me.

707
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:11,176
- That came out wrong.
- No, I got it.

708
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:14,541
Goodnight.

709
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:15,780
'Night.

710
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:26,277
Gilmore, your grandfather has apalling taste in Scotch.

711
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:28,748
I think you should go on inside and tell him!

712
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,740
If he hasn't learned by now I certainly can't teach him.

713
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:33,992
Colin, make sure you refill that bottle with something, we don't want Ace over here to get busted.

714
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:35,087
I know. I know.

715
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:36,879
- Refill?
- Sure, why not?

716
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:40,987
Because drinking is bad. It's very, very bad and we're bad for doing it.

717
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:42,599
Spank me.

718
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:45,795
I think the hangover tomorrow will be punishment enough.

719
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:47,514
She hasn't had enough champagne, Logan.

720
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,754
Hey, listen, I forgot to tell you, I read the article.

721
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,931
- You did?
- Yep, not bad.

722
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:55,450
- Thank you.
- Caught the spirit of the thing, I'll give you that.

723
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:57,646
- But?
- No, no buts. You've got a good style.

724
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,822
There were a few too many similes in it for my taste,

725
00:37:59,873 --> 00:38:02,551
but it definitely had a Joseph Mitchell thing going for it, I like that.

726
00:38:02,623 --> 00:38:04,313
I'm surprised you even bothered to read it.

727
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,445
Are you? Hmm. So, who's it going to be?

728
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:09,422
What?

729
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:12,125
Well, this shindig's an obvious meat market, I've got the feeling

730
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:14,840
that your grandparents are expecting you to choose someone tonight, so...

731
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:16,857
- Oh, well...
- Me. Pick me.

732
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:17,921
No, pick me!

733
00:38:19,192 --> 00:38:21,290
- But I'm exotic!
- So's the Asian Bird flu.

734
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,445
Wow. A room full of guys and still extremely slim pickings.

735
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:28,843
Well, I don't know. It's a tough choice, maybe I should let my boyfriend help me choose.

736
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:30,205
- You have a boyfriend?
- I'm crushed.

737
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:32,315
- Ain't it always the way?
- Do Richard and Emily know about this?

738
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:34,567
- Yeah, they do.
- They're just trying to make sure you got a backup?

739
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:38,458
- No, they're just - oh no, what time is it?
- It's crying time.

740
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,408
- Eight forty five.
- Dean is meeting me at eight-thirty!

741
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:43,148
- Where?
- Here, out front!

742
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:45,338
- Dean, is this the boyfriend?
- Yes, the boyfriend!

743
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,912
- Well, we got to see this guy.
- What?

744
00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:50,429
See who the man is who's won your heart. Got to make sure he's good enough. Let's go, boys!

745
00:38:50,648 --> 00:38:52,849
- But - hey!
- Coming?

746
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:05,682
Dean, hi. I'm sorry, have you been waiting long?

747
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:09,178
I didn't have a watch and we were in the pool house. These are some friends.

748
00:39:09,261 --> 00:39:11,263
They go to Yale with me and they know my grandparents.

749
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:13,234
The party was so boring so we...

750
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,135
Is that a new shirt? 'Cause I like it.

751
00:39:20,115 --> 00:39:23,176
- What am I doing here, Rory?
- You're picking me up.

752
00:39:25,558 --> 00:39:30,192
I don't belong here. Not anymore.

753
00:39:33,524 --> 00:39:34,558
Do I?

754
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:36,658
Dean.

755
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,133
You look good.

756
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:06,922
You�ll be okay.

757
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:10,513
No, I won't.

758
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:16,841
Okay, that's it. Back to the pool house, men. We have some serious bucking up to do here.

759
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:17,844
I swiped some Scotch.

760
00:40:17,942 --> 00:40:19,837
I'll reenact the Passion of the Christ.

761
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:27,696
Hey Ace, nothing ever seems quite as bad after Finn's Passion of the Christ.

762
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:29,442
Except Finn's Passion of the Christ.

763
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:42,703
- Gilmore residence.
- Hello!

764
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:47,130
Oh, you speak English! Thank God! Um, is Emily Gilmore there, please?

765
00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:48,251
It's for you, Mrs. Gilmore.

766
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,458
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom, it's me.

767
00:40:50,638 --> 00:40:52,634
- Well, hello, Lorelai. How are you?
- I'm fine.

768
00:40:52,738 --> 00:40:55,565
- Can I talk to you and Dad for a minute?
- Your father's paying the caterers.

769
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:58,377
Well this'll just take a minute. Could you maybe go in the study

770
00:40:58,463 --> 00:41:00,639
on the speakerphone? Seriously, just one minute?

771
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,005
All right. Hold on.

772
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:07,648
All right, we're both here.

773
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:09,578
Hello, Lorelai. What can we do for you?

774
00:41:09,663 --> 00:41:13,208
I just wanted to touch base with you about this little party you threw for Rory tonight.

775
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,356
The party was not for Rory, it was for our Yale alumni.

776
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:20,821
Oh, it was not. It was a trick and you know it and I know it so let's just know it together.

777
00:41:20,888 --> 00:41:22,716
What do you want, Lorelai?

778
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:26,356
You lied to your granddaughter tonight. You lied to a kid who trusted you. You tricked her.

779
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:28,523
- It was a party!
- It was a mating ritual!

780
00:41:28,598 --> 00:41:32,207
- What are you talking about?
- All boys, Mom? Seriously? What is that all about?

781
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,584
It's good for her to interact with her peers.

782
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:37,841
Lorelai, Rory is in a new phase of her life now,

783
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:40,759
and she needs to be exposed to different things, different people.

784
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:42,157
That's all we were trying to do.

785
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:44,404
- She has a boyfriend!
- Oh, so what?

786
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:47,477
So, she has a boyfriend, which means she doesn't need another one!

787
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,622
She's twenty years old, Lorelai. She's not going to be with that boy forever.

788
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:55,889
That's right. And when she's ready to move on, she will have met some nice young men

789
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,003
who will represent the new phase in her life.

790
00:41:58,106 --> 00:42:00,907
I'm sure that Dean is a very nice young man.

791
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:02,974
But he is certainly not good enough for Rory!

792
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:03,798
That's right!

793
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:06,005
Now she is young. But young people need guidance.

794
00:42:06,078 --> 00:42:09,559
And since you seem so little help in this department, we had to step in.

795
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,625
Well, step on out again, because this is none of your business!

796
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:14,827
Lorelai, I am tired.

797
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:18,495
And the caterers have caked the floor with something sticky and I don't have time for this.

798
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:20,818
We want more for her, period.

799
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:23,829

00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:28,938

802
00:42:29,015 --> 00:42:32,768
Rory will choose her own path in life and there's nothing either one of you can do about it.

803
00:42:32,835 --> 00:42:34,468
- I'm hanging up.

804
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:58,229

805
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:00,911
Bye!
