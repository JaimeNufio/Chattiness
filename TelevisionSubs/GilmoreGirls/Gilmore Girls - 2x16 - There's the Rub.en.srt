1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,797
Here you go.

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,927
Jeez! Sorry, folks.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,595
Here.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,723
There we go. Free coffee all around.

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,727
Might wanna put your hand over that.
There we go.

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,522
Tom, what the hell is going on up there?

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,732
We're redoing your apartment.
What'd you think?

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,527
The ceiling's falling.
I got customers eating dry wall here.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,154
- That can't be good.
- You said minimal disruptions.

10
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,658
This is minimal disruptions.
I need you to sign this change order.

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,910
- What happened now?
- We broke through this wall...

12
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,538
and found pipes that shouldn't be there.
Gotta move them.

13
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,997
- Move them where?
- Not sure.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,458
- We gotta find out what they do first.
- You're kidding.

15
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,628
Yeah, there's nothing I like more
than a good moving-a-pipe joke.

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,672
Fine. One more week. That's it.

17
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,174
Oh, sure, construction ultimatum.

18
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,511
That's even funnier
than my moving-a-pipe joke.

19
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,350
- Jeez, look at this place. It's a mess.
- How long...

20
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,977
- No, can't sit here.
- Why not?

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,229
Three people got nailed in the head
here earlier.

22
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,898
- Their food was okay, right?
- Will you just move?

23
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,400
Outside.

24
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:10,487
You know, if I sit here one more second,
I just might be outside.

25
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,448
Order me some coffee.

26
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,914
You are really funny.
You and Tom should put an act together.

27
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,292
I'd leave it open.

28
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,004
Go ahead, Mom. I can hear you now.

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,381
I wanted to know
if you'd like a gift certificate...

30
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,676
- for a weekend at the Birchgrove Spa.
- Are you serious?

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,554
I bid on it at
the DAR Symphony Fundraiser, and I won.

32
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,515
It's supposed to be an amazing place.
Why don't you go?

33
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,059
I've never had any real desire
to go to a spa.

34
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,188
- Why did you bid on it?
- For charity. I had to bid on something.

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,107
I certainly didn't want another portrait
of George Washington.

36
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,692
I've got four in the attic already.

37
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,485
- I'd love it.
- Good.

38
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,405
Two days
of total mind-numbing pampering.

39
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,407
Massages, facials, aromatherapy.

40
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,034
You make it sound like heaven.

41
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,912
- Closest you'll ever come to being a dog.
- I beg your pardon?

42
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,748
You know, a whole life
of nothing but eating, sleeping...

43
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,666
lying on your back and getting rubbed.

44
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,793
I'd love the comparison to stop there.

45
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,046
- When's it for?
- This weekend, actually.

46
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,881
Well, I'll be there.

47
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,925
- So will I.
- Excuse me?

48
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,510
The certificate is for two.

49
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,429
Since it sounds like
the most wonderful place in the world...

50
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,181
I might as well try it with you.

51
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,892
- But...
- That's all right, isn't it, if I join you?

52
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,477
You don't mind?

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,063
- No, I don't mind at all.
- Wonderful.

54
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,148
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

55
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,192
I'm actually looking forward to this.

56
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,111
Oh, yeah, me, too. Thanks, Mom.

57
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,030
Bye-bye.

58
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,162
I'm going to a spa with my mother.

59
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,581
Lean forward.

60
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,812
So, then we're all confirmed.

61
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,773
Great. Thanks so much for your help.

62
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,358
Okay. Bye.

63
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,028
- Yes.
- That was an evil 'yes. '

64
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,529
Not an evil 'yes. '

65
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,200
It's a 'Yes, I'm pretty,
but, hello, I'm smart' kind of a 'yes. '

66
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,326
My mistake.

67
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,703
So here's the deal. I go into my facial...

68
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,997
just as my mother
is finishing her Salt Glow...

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,875
which'll end 10 minutes
after I've hit my scalp treatment...

70
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,504
which puts me in the Watsu massage pool
six minutes into her back facial.

71
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,465
The day is so well planned,
I won't see her until dinner...

72
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,510
which'll be cut short
by the food poisoning I plan to contract.

73
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,387
- You are 12 and disgusting.
- I am trapped and desperate.

74
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,182
You really think you can avoid Grandma
the entire weekend?

75
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,518
I'm nothing if not a great organizer.

76
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,229
Now, let's talk about
what you're gonna do tonight.

77
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,231
Throwing a party, I hope.

78
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,776
Inviting hundreds of bikers and lowlifes
who are gonna trash the place.

79
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,571
I am going to do laundry, watch TV,
order Indian food, and go to bed early.

80
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,908
And then come the bikers and lowlifes
who are gonna trash the place?

81
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,452
I may even fall asleep on the couch
with the TV on.

82
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,038
When do the bikers and lowlifes
get to trash the place?

83
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,248
You're all packed.

84
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,084
You have to do something bad
when Mommy's out of town.

85
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,920
It's the law.
You've seen Risky Business, right?

86
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,422
Now, I'm not asking
for a prostitution ring...

87
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,133
but how about a floating craps game
or something?

88
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,095
- I'll see what I can do.
- I'd greatly appreciate it.

89
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,347
I think Grandma's here.

90
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,100
What's she honking for?
She hates honking.

91
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,978
She calls it a mechanical bodily function.

92
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,355
Jeez.

93
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:16,900
Cool!

94
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,319
Hello, hello, hello.

95
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,779
What are we, going to the prom?

96
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,532
I just thought since this weekend
is all about relaxing...

97
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,075
we should start with the ride.

98
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,244
- This is cool, Grandma.
- Thank you, Rory.

99
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,747
- So are we all ready to go?
- I guess so, Miss Daisy.

100
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,499
- Bye, sweets.
- Bye.

101
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,835
- Bye, Grandma.
- Goodbye, Rory.

102
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,503
Have a good time.

103
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,839
- Bikers and lowlifes.
- I'll get right on it.

104
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,845
In general, the lab reports weren't bad,
but they weren't great either...

105
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,471
which leads me to question...

106
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:50,475
whether everyone has the grasp
on electrochemistry I'd prefer...

107
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,977
before we move on.

108
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,272
To that end, I will be giving another test
on Tuesday...

109
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,734
covering Chapters 14 through 18
in your textbooks...

110
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,403
as well as the material from lab.

111
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,990
Now please proceed with the assignment
we all started yesterday...

112
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,951
as that, too, will be included on the test.

113
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,293
- Madeline.
- What?

114
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,754
- What are you guys doing tonight?
- It's Friday night.

115
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,672
- So, you've got dates?
- Yeah, why?

116
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,674
I was hoping you could study with me.

117
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,176
- On a Friday night?
- Yes.

118
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,303
- We've got dates.
- What is she saying?

119
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,847
- She wants us to study with her.
- On a Friday night?

120
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,265
- Yeah.
- But we've got dates.

121
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,518
I know.
I was hoping maybe you'd cancel them.

122
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,644
- To study?
- Yes.

123
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,896
- On a Friday night?
- What did she say?

124
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,148
She wants us to cancel our dates to study.

125
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,692
- On a Friday night?
- That's what she said.

126
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,529
- But we have...
- Oh, my God. Forget it!

127
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,202
So I suppose that you have
big Friday night plans also?

128
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,286
Kind of.

129
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,206
The fact that I'm seeing
my entire Harvard career slip away...

130
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,209
- is of no interest to anyone?
- What are you talking about?

131
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,378
- I got an A-minus, okay?
- So?

132
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,754
What do you mean 'so'?

133
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,549
I got an A-minus.
I have never gotten an A-minus.

134
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,969
I just can't focus lately.
Things are so weird at my house.

135
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,514
My dad figured out exactly how much
it'd cost him to divorce my mom.

136
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,765
So now he's back.

137
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,726
It's bad enough I wasted time
crunching the numbers with him...

138
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,146
but now that he's back, they're fighting
and redecorating. It's a mess.

139
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,481
I need help.

140
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,191
Look, I can't tonight...

141
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,152
but if you're still freaked out
after the quiz on Tuesday...

142
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:27,698
I will spend every day next week
helping you prepare for the final, okay?

143
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,324
- I guess.
- Relax.

144
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,535
It will be fine. I promise.

145
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:36,373
All I had to do was move a decimal point,
and none of this would have happened.

146
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,169
Look at this place. It's lovely.

147
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,963
And that smell. What is that? Eucalyptus?

148
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,299
- I don't know.
- Well, it's lovely.

149
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,593
Lorelai, come over here. Look.

150
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,512
- They have cucumber slices in the water.
- Wow.

151
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:53,974
If they have ranch dressing
in the soap dispensers, this place is great.

152
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,684
You know what? I love it here.

153
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,103
Careful. That's how they get you
in the Moonies.

154
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,272
I feel more relaxed already.

155
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,401
That's the most delicious water I've had.
Have a sip.

156
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,070
- Let's just check in, shall we?
- Okay.

157
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,575
Hello. I'm Emily Gilmore.
This is my daughter Lorelai.

158
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,411
Yes, welcome to Birchgrove.
My name is Bobby.

159
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,288
I have everything all set for you.

160
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,874
- Any luggage?
- It's in the Luca Brasi-mobile out front.

161
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,918
We can take care of that for you.

162
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:25,214
Here are your room keys
and a copy of all of your spa activities.

163
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,132
You ladies are booked solid, I see.

164
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,801
We intend to leave here
completely different people.

165
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,179
Yes, I'm going to be Ted Nugent.

166
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,640
Anyhow, your rooms
are right down this hall.

167
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,142
Fruit and yogurt is served
by the pool in the mornings.

168
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,353
Lunch and dinner seatings
are on that itinerary.

169
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,687
- Any questions?
- Yes.

170
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,023
Where can one get a cup of coffee
around here?

171
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,442
We don't serve anything
with caffeine here.

172
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,528
And you think that's safe?

173
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,864
Thank you. We're sure we're going to have
a wonderful time.

174
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,324
Mom, there's no coffee.

175
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,118
It won't kill you
to go two days without coffee.

176
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,578
No, I think it will.

177
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,122
Just focus on all the pampering
we're going to have.

178
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,542
Look at all the things
we have to look forward to.

179
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,626
- Oh, no.
- What?

180
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,754
I'll be right back.
They screwed up our appointments.

181
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,714
- Again?
- What do you mean, 'again'?

182
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:11,134
On the way to your house, I called
to confirm our schedule and found...

183
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,971
they had booked us separately
for every one of our treatments.

184
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,766
I insisted on speaking to a manager
and was able to straighten everything out.

185
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,518
- Yes, those are right.
- They are?

186
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,396
I had them move the pedicure tubs
together in the same room...

187
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,607
- so we can talk during it.
- I'm really gonna need a cup of coffee.

188
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,402
- Have some cucumber water.
- No, that's not gonna do it...

189
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,487
- Drink, Lorelai.
- Cucumber water. Yuck.

190
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,541
Well, your lung capacity
certainly has improved.

191
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,210
Well, I've been playing
a lot more basketball lately.

192
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:49,548
Yet another reason to continue the fight
to keep physical education in schools.

193
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,342
- So, tonight...
- Yes?

194
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,136
- I was thinking...
- Yes?

195
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,848
Since your mother's going to be gone,
maybe I'd come over.

196
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,516
What?

197
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,644
I was thinking of pulling
kind of a hermit thing tonight.

198
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:03,979
- Why?
- I don't know.

199
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,689
J.D. Salinger seems to dig it.

200
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,025
- You don't want me to come over?
- No, I just...

201
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,820
I almost never get the house all to myself,
and I thought with my mom gone...

202
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,364
I can finally do my laundry
exactly the way I like it.

203
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,534
Not separating into whites and colors,
but the colors separated...

204
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,994
into darks, mediums, and lights.

205
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,913
With a separate pile for white T-shirts...

206
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,498
and T-shirts with writing on them...

207
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,541
like 'Rock Star,'
'Evil,' or 'Kafka Was Here. '

208
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,335
You want to be alone to do laundry?

209
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,506
And watch TV, and eat the Indian food
I love but my mom hates the smell of...

210
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,424
and go to bed early, and...

211
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,926
Are you mad?

212
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,262
Why would I be mad?
You want to spend tonight alone.

213
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:40,599
But tomorrow,
the whole day is all about you.

214
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,684
I mean it. From morning till night.

215
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,102
You plan it, or I'll plan it...

216
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,939
or we can get a professional to plan it,
whatever you want.

217
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,149
- Just don't be mad.
- I'm not.

218
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,445
- I'm not mad.
- Good.

219
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,740
- I'm confused, but I'm not mad.
- Fine.

220
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,284
I'm a saint, but I'm not mad.

221
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,411
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

222
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,373
So, deep breath, and...

223
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,982
- How do I look?
- Like a landlady. What is this?

224
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,108
I got adjoining rooms.

225
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,485
We don't have to go out in the hall
to see each other.

226
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:34,611
Great thinking.

227
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,781
God, this robe is fabulous.
How do they get it so soft?

228
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,993
Having about 40 other people wear it first
is part of the secret.

229
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,120
Stop it. So are you all ready...

230
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:47,166
for our skin-rejuvenating and revitalizing
collagen facial and eye treatment?

231
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,458
Almost.

232
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,878
It has vitamin C and plant extracts in it...

233
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,338
which is the hottest thing
in skincare these days.

234
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,841
The eye treatment
is supposed to reduce puffiness...

235
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,218
and minimize the appearance of fine lines.

236
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,012
Okay, no more brochures for you.

237
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,430
I'm ready. Let's go.

238
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,056
- Aren't you wearing your robe?
- What?

239
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,516
You're supposed to wear a robe.

240
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,393
They'll give me one when I get there.

241
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,353
- But these robes are wonderful.
- Mom.

242
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,438
They help you relax.

243
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,441
- We're late, Mom.
- They're wonderful, relaxing robes.

244
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,234
- Oh, my God.
- Yet you stand there...

245
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,863
like it's some badge of honor
not to put on your robe like everyone else.

246
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,282
This isn't for me, you know. It's for you.

247
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,452
I already have on my robe.
I am already relaxed.

248
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,123
- What are you doing?
- You're kidding me, right?

249
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,876
Well, hurry up. We're going to be late.

250
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,629
Happy?

251
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:37,049
Apparently, you didn't see
the matching slippers.

252
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,888
So, how are we doing?

253
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,640
- So good.
- Okay.

254
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:48,060
I'm gonna leave you to sit
for a few minutes, so relax and enjoy...

255
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,437
- and I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

256
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,295
- Are your feet sweating?
- Mom?

257
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,882
Those booties make my feet sweat.
Don't they make your feet sweat?

258
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,926
What are you doing in my room?

259
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,555
Magda left me sitting for 20 minutes.
Fine time to take a coffee break.

260
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,431
She's not taking a coffee break.

261
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,768
Your skin is supposed to be absorbing
the moisture in your mask.

262
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,311
In your room.

263
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,190
Let's see what's next on our agenda,
shall we?

264
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,111
Stop moving, Lorelai.
You'll electrocute yourself.

265
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,405
The Egyptian mud bath.

266
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,325
I wonder if a mud bath is one
of those things you see in brochures...

267
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,538
where they wrap you in towels
like you're in a cocoon of some sort.

268
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,540
That might be nice.

269
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,293
Especially if their towels
are as good as their robes.

270
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,712
Because I just love these robes.

271
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,756
Wonder where they get these robes.

272
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,717
Shouldn't be hard
to find the manufacturer.

273
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,553
I could order a few of them.
For me, you, and Rory.

274
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,222
I still can't get over it. It really was mud.

275
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,849
I mean, I know it said mud bath...

276
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,310
but I didn't really think
they meant a real mud bath.

277
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,062
The odd thing is,
I should've been more repulsed by it.

278
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:17,024
Sitting in a tub of hot dirt,
which is basically what mud is...

279
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,152
should have made me ill,
and yet, I really enjoyed it.

280
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,279
Did yours have twigs? Mine had twigs.

281
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,364
When I asked the woman about them...

282
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:28,243
she told me they were there
because of the healing qualities.

283
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,958
What are you doing? Lorelai, stop it!
You're pushing me.

284
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,802
How's the pressure? Too much?

285
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,850
- Yep.
- Sorry. I'll go lighter.

286
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,144
Your hands are amazing.

287
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,522
Compliment your masseur's hands,
Lorelai.

288
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,898
Oh, my God.

289
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,691
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

290
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,693
You were muttering under your breath.

291
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,655
Years of experience have taught me
that when you do that...

292
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,323
it's usually about me.

293
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,661
Mom, you signed us up
for a couple's massage.

294
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,288
- So?
- A couple's massage is for a couple...

295
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,832
not a couple of people.

296
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,709
It's more efficient this way.
We finish at the same time.

297
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,295
Do you know what most people
who get these massages do...

298
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,257
about five minutes after it's over?
They have sex, together...

299
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,843
probably while wearing their robes.

300
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,888
Could the two of you excuse us
for a moment, please? Thank you.

301
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,227
- Well, that was appalling.
- Well, that was true.

302
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,396
You're determined to spoil this,
aren't you?

303
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,481
Why, because I want
a quiet, private massage?

304
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,942
You've been pouting and sulking
and sighing...

305
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,778
- I haven't been sighing.
... rolling your eyes, mumbling.

306
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,113
That's how I detox.

307
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:49,199
You've made it your mission
to be as miserable as possible.

308
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,951
- That's not true.
- It's completely true.

309
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,036
If you don't care
about hurting my feelings...

310
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,873
maybe you care that you're wasting
all your relaxing time...

311
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,375
acting like a petulant 4-year-old.

312
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,378
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,339
Do you want me
to try to get myself another room?

314
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,424
No.

315
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,384
I saw a supply closet down the hall.

316
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,261
Maybe my masseur
could finish me in there.

317
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,429
Okay, Mom.

318
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,223
Or perhaps I could roll myself
against a stucco wall...

319
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,434
eliminate the need
for a masseur altogether.

320
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,394
Lie down, Mom, please.

321
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,688
If you say so.

322
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,153
- Lorelai?
- Yes, Mom.

323
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,989
Would you go get the boys, please?

324
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:43,003
No, that's two orders of garlic nan,
three samosas, and a Chicken vindaloo.

325
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:46,965
And rice. And the green sauce.
And no salad. And...

326
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,968
Oh, wait. Sorry, can you hold on a sec?

327
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,095
- Hello?
- Hi. This is Phil's Liquor.

328
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,264
I'm supposed to deliver
a keg there tonight.

329
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,599
Hold on.

330
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,477
Hi. Sorry. Yeah, that's it.

331
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,104
Forty minutes. Great. Bye.

332
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,316
- Who was that?
- Sandeep's.

333
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,443
You're ordering the Indian food.

334
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,569
- Yep.
- Good, enjoy.

335
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,656
Burn the house down after.
It's the only way to get the smell out.

336
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,533
- Absolutely. How's the spa?
- Tranquil.

337
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:13,992
- Really?
- I wasn't done.

338
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,370
Tranquilizers will be required...

339
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,664
if I have to spend one more minute
with my mother.

340
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,707
Tell me you're trying to get along with her.

341
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,417
- I'm being a peach.
- Really?

342
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,586
Well, I smell like a peach.

343
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,922
- Was that the doorbell?
- Yeah. Call you later.

344
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,382
Wait. I wanna find out who it is.

345
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,468
The sooner you get back to your weekend,
the sooner it'll be over.

346
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,763
Can you get out my address book
and count how many friends I have?

347
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,181
- Bye.
- Mean.

348
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,724
Steal me soap.

349
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:39,977
Paris, what...

350
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,229
I tried to stay home and study myself,
but I can't.

351
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,689
I don't know what anything means.

352
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,233
I can't even read my own handwriting.
What does this say?

353
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,694
Whoever wrote this
should be dressed in a clown suit...

354
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,529
stuffing bodies under their porch.

355
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,447
- You're in your pajamas.
- I know.

356
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,492
This was the big night you planned?
A rendezvous with Mr. Peanut?

357
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,077
- L...
- You're doing laundry.

358
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,329
- Yes.
- You're doing laundry in your pajamas.

359
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,207
My mom's out of town,
and I never get the house all to myself.

360
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,543
You never go months
without seeing your parents...

361
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,795
getting a postcard
that doesn't have a courtesy...

362
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,380
'Wish you were here' written on it?

363
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,716
- That sucks. Don't let me stand in the way.
- Wait.

364
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,551
No. I don't wanna get in the way.

365
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:14,636
I hear there'll be
some hot knitting going on.

366
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,722
- Fine, I'll study with you.
- You will?

367
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,223
For one hour. That's it.

368
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,435
We'll do a quick review and a pop quiz,
and then you're going home.

369
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,561
- Deal?
- Deal.

370
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,730
Okay. So, go sit on the couch.

371
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,065
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Where are you going?

372
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,567
I'm going to go change.

373
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,696
Okay, but my hour doesn't start
till you get back out here, right?

374
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,578
- You ready?
- Wow, you look great, Mom.

375
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,873
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm being completely serious.

376
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,708
Oh, well, thank you.

377
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,878
That's a pretty color. What is that?

378
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,672
- It's called 'Vicious Trollop. '
- Stop it.

379
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,717
Why would you name a lipstick
something like that?

380
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,261
- 'Cause 'Dirty Whore' was taken?
- You frighten me.

381
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:57,888
- Wanna try some?
- No, thank you.

382
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,057
- Go on, Mom, try it.
- It won't look good on me.

383
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,433
Sure it will.

384
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:05,479
- All right, but if I look ridiculous...
- I'll be the first one to point it out.

385
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,648
You're a vicious trollop.

386
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,316
- Lorelai.
- Sorry.

387
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:10,901
Well?

388
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,819
- I like it.
- You do?

389
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,949
- I like it, too.
- Good, let's go then. I'm starving.

390
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,535
Me, too. What are they serving
for dinner tonight?

391
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,245
Well, let's see.

392
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,002
They certainly do like their tofu here,
don't they?

393
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,963
And the word 'steamed. '

394
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,507
Well, they have dessert at least.

395
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,093
Cookies sweetened
with sprouted mung bean.

396
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,679
- That sounds dreadful.
- Yes, it does.

397
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,516
Where are you going? You're not
changing? Our seating's in 10 minutes.

398
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,642
Get your coat.

399
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,269
I don't need it for the dining room.

400
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,229
- We're not going there.
- Where are we going?

401
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,438
- Out.
- Out where?

402
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:52,317
We're going to leave the spa,
find a restaurant, and have a steak.

403
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,194
- A steak?
- Who's gonna stop us?

404
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:57,281
- A steak.
- Come on, Mom. What's it gonna be?

405
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,409
Vicious trollop
or the wide world of mung beans?

406
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,828
- Let's go.
- I'm right behind you.

407
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,666
Given that those are the reactions
occurring in the two half-cells...

408
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,001
what do you do next?

409
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,295
We add them together,
doubling the coefficients...

410
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,463
of the silver half equation
but not the voltage.

411
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,549
We get the equation
for the complete reaction.

412
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,177
You're in much better shape
than you wanna think you are.

413
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,595
Impossible.

414
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,681
- Where are you going?
- That's my food.

415
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:26,018
- Another half hour. Please.
- No. You got your hour, you need to go.

416
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,144
- But...
- Go.

417
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,312
Fine.

418
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,772
- Delivery.
- What're you doing here?

419
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:34,109
Luke figured since you're alone,
you wouldn't have food in the house.

420
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,527
So he sent over a care package.

421
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,197
I don't need a care package.
I ordered from Sandeep's.

422
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,532
Really? Plan on burning down
the house afterwards?

423
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,159
The only way to kill the smell.

424
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,661
Where should I put this? Kitchen?

425
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,456
Sure.

426
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:54,213
God, how much food is in there?
This could feed 12.

427
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,048
Excuse me, I've seen you eat.

428
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,467
- Fine, six.
- Well, he wanted you taken care of.

429
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,677
Wasn't sure how long your mom
would be gone for.

430
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,638
- Just tonight.
- He didn't know that.

431
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,681
- Now you can tell him.
- I will.

432
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,725
So, how come Caesar
didn't bring this over?

433
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,685
- I volunteered.
- Why?

434
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,729
Wanted to get out
of the construction zone.

435
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,065
There's nothing but banging and yelling.

436
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,192
Place gives me a headache.

437
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,695
Why, did you think I wanted
to come over here and see you?

438
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,364
- No.
- I just needed some quiet.

439
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,532
- Fine.
- That's all.

440
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,616
- Got it.
- Clear my head.

441
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,909
I understand.

442
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,578
- So aren't you gonna eat?
- Eventually.

443
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,747
- It gets cold fast.
- I can heat it up.

444
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:30,916
Reheated French fries really suck.

445
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,209
They do suck.

446
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,752
Yeah, so eat.

447
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,671
Okay, I will.

448
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,758
- You're still standing there.
- You didn't give me a tip.

449
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,469
- You want money?
- No. I'll take a fry, though.

450
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,721
Okay. Yeah. Have as much as you want.

451
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,223
Okay, great.

452
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:49,685
What are you doing?

453
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,728
- Getting ready to eat.
- You're staying?

454
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,106
- Didn't you just invite me?
- No, I...

455
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:57,609
You told me to have all I wanted.
That sounded invitation-like.

456
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,611
You want to stay here and eat?

457
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,488
- Beats being at Luke's.
- But...

458
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,240
I can't find my flashcards.

459
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:04,992
I didn't know you had company.

460
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,785
This is Paris. We were just studying.

461
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:10,038
Don't worry. I was just leaving.
If you find my flashcards, call me.

462
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,165
- No.
- What?

463
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:12,457
Stay for dinner.

464
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,459
- But I thought...
- We have a ton of food...

465
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,461
and we can go over the notes more later.

466
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:17,963
- You sure?
- Positive.

467
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,882
- Is that mac and cheese?
- Sure is.

468
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,633
- I love mac and cheese.
- Great.

469
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,261
- I'm not allowed to have mac and cheese.
- Splurge.

470
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:25,637
Come on, Paris, stay.

471
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:29,099
Do you have a 24-hour pharmacy
in case I have an allergic reaction?

472
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:31,059
- Believe it or not, we do.
- Okay.

473
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:34,021
- Can I borrow your phone?
- It's by the door.

474
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,315
- Interesting.
- What is?

475
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,650
- You think we need a chaperon?
- No, I don't.

476
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:41,320
- You just invited one.
- Just being polite.

477
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,654
Paris is alone tonight...

478
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,948
and you yourself said
we have enough food for six.

479
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,326
- With me, it's down to four.
- With Paris, it's two.

480
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,286
- Works out well.
- I think so.

481
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,354
My goodness, look at this place.

482
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,357
I bet there's no cucumber slices
in the water here.

483
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,484
- Hi, there. Party of two.
- Okay.

484
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:23,570
I can take your name, but I won't have
a table for about an hour.

485
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:25,405
- An hour?
- I can't wait an hour.

486
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,949
- Me neither.
- I'll pass out.

487
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,742
Go first. You can break my fall.

488
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:30,702
- Can we bribe you?
- Sorry.

489
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,996
- Please? She's loaded.
- Lorelai!

490
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,957
A couple of stools opened up at the bar...

491
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,583
and we serve our entire menu there.

492
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,377
That is a great idea. Thanks. Come on.

493
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,255
- We can't eat dinner at a bar.
- I don't wanna wait an hour.

494
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,298
I'm wearing the wrong shoes
for a drive-thru.

495
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:44,424
What'll people think?

496
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,635
That we're loose women
with questionable morals.

497
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,555
It's not right to eat dinner
when your feet don't touch the floor.

498
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,474
- What can I get you ladies?
- Hi, Steve. Nice to meet you.

499
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,769
- We will have two martinis?
- Why not?

500
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:59,022
Two vodka martinis straight up
with a twist, very dry, very cold...

501
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:01,233
- and a couple of menus.
- And some peanuts.

502
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,734
Peanuts. Good idea.

503
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,611
Here you go. I'll get your drinks.

504
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,989
Thank you. You're a good man, Steve.

505
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:11,118
Okay, I'm thinking steak
and Caesar salad, if it's not too anchovy-y.

506
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,203
Do you wanna split
a shrimp cocktail to start?

507
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:14,580
That sounds fine.

508
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:18,167
I just love the idea of shrimp cocktail
with a steak dinner, you know?

509
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,502
It's so casino, Big Joe, steak and shrimp.

510
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:21,962
Save some for winter.

511
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,423
I never realized
how wonderful peanuts were before.

512
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,675
- Want a refill?
- Yes, please.

513
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,345
- Cheers, Mom.
- Cheers.

514
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,103
- I must tell you, I never expected this.
- What?

515
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:40,105
Me inhaling peanuts at a singles bar.

516
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,733
This isn't a singles bar, Mom.
It's a 60-40 bar.

517
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:43,817
A what?

518
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,944
60-year-old men hitting on
40-year-old women.

519
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,696
- Divorcées, mostly.
- Really?

520
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,114
Look around.

521
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:55,287
Now, she can do better than that.
What does she see in him?

522
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,956
Big will, short life span. The usual draw.

523
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,002
I wonder if they have pretzels, too.

524
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:05,422
Don't look now, but I think
you're passing for a 40-year-old woman.

525
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:06,548
What?

526
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:09,551
2:00, silver fox, totally checking you out.

527
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,097
- He is not.
- Well, he's not staring at Steve.

528
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:16,266
You're being ridiculous.

529
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,730
He's definitely not looking at me.

530
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,486
- He's still looking.
- Drink your martini, Lorelai.

531
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,157
- A tragic waste of paper.
- I can't believe you just said that.

532
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:35,118
It's true. The Beats' writing
was completely self-indulgent.

533
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,287
I have one word for Jack Kerouac: Edit.

534
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,582
It was not self-indulgent.
The Beats believed in shocking people...

535
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:41,792
stirring things up.

536
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,919
They believed in drugs, booze,
and petty crime.

537
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,755
They expose you to a world
you wouldn't have otherwise known.

538
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,298
Isn't it what great writing's about?

539
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:51,426
It wasn't great writing.
It was the National Enquirer of the '50s.

540
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,136
- You're cracked.
- Typical guy response.

541
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:54,471
Worship Kerouac and Bukowski.

542
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:56,682
God forbid you pick up anything
by Jane Austen.

543
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,684
- I've read Jane Austen.
- You have?

544
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,019
Yeah. And I think
she would have liked Bukowski.

545
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,063
- What are you doing?
- Salt and peppered it.

546
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,523
- Only way to eat a fry.
- Really?

547
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,191
It's fast-food gospel.

548
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,280
That's good. That's really good.

549
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:14,116
- Do you like hot sauce?
- I don't know. Should I?

550
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,243
I think it's wise.

551
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:17,327
Hello?

552
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:21,415
- Where are you?
- On my way to see you, if that's okay.

553
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:24,042
I know you wanna be alone.
I'll only stay a minute.

554
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,170
- I just want to say hi.
- You said hi.

555
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,381
- I want to say hi a little closer.
- But I'm a mess.

556
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,425
It's not pretty. You won't recognize me.

557
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,677
Then put a nametag on, 'cause I miss you.

558
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,138
- I miss you, too, but...
- But what?

559
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,557
- Paris is here.
- Why?

560
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,351
She freaked out about a grade
and wanted to go over notes.

561
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,020
You know her, she will not be denied.

562
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,023
I'm not really ruining your alone night.
Someone else did that.

563
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,192
- Yes, but...
- I'll see you in a sec.

564
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,068
Can't get into poetry.

565
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,863
It's like,'Jeez, just say it already.
We're dying here. '

566
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:56,033
I just noticed the time,
and it's getting really late.

567
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,201
It's 7:00.

568
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:00,496
I know, but Paris and I still have
a lot more studying to do.

569
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:03,415
Jess, please thank Luke for me.
It was really nice of him.

570
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:05,125
- Who was that on the phone?
- No one.

571
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,628
'No one' wouldn't be
heading over here, would he?

572
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,004
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

573
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,673
Dean's on his way,
and Rory doesn't want him to find me.

574
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:13,383
- Why?
- You know why.

575
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,386
- We're just eating dinner.
- Jess, I'm asking you as a friend.

576
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,014
- Please leave now.
- You really want me to go?

577
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,558
I really want to avoid a fight with Dean.

578
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,395
- Okay, I'm going.
- Thank you.

579
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,732
What?

580
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:31,485
I just twisted my ankle.
I better go lie down.

581
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:36,198
You're no fun when you're tense.
Are you sure you want me to go?

582
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,408
Maybe this can be solved
between me and Dean...

583
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,160
if we had a little heart-to-heart.

584
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:42,704
He could tell me his issues,
I'll tell him mine.

585
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,915
- I promise I'll speak slowly.
- Bye.

586
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,168
Give him my best, would you?

587
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:51,296
Actually, I guess I could do that myself.

588
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,799
Dean, Jess just came by
to bring me some food.

589
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:54,925
From Luke's.

590
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,802
- He wanted to make sure I ate.
- Luke did.

591
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,720
Personally, I could care less if she eats.

592
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,389
True, he could care less.

593
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,724
I see you brought a little something, too.

594
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,769
Is that ice cream? That's so nice.

595
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,939
A tiny little ice-cream package
just big enough for two.

596
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:12,943
Are you guys gonna feed each other?
'Cause that's just so darn cute.

597
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:16,905
You're doing that towering-over-me thing.

598
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,241
I tell you, you've really got that down.

599
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:21,493
It helps that you're 12 feet tall.

600
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:24,621
But this Frankenstein scowl
really adds to the whole...

601
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,832
- Jess!
- Okay, I'm going.

602
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,919
Look, man, I really was
just dropping off some food...

603
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:33,714
so don't get all West Side Story
on me, okay?

604
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,510
So, do you want to come in?

605
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,512
What the hell is going on?

606
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:44,433
- Dean, you remember Paris, right?
- Yeah, hi.

607
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,895
So Jess just dropped this off?

608
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,191
Now, I know you eat fast, but this is
a lot of food to put away that quickly...

609
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,985
- even on your best day.
- Okay, he didn't just drop it off.

610
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,987
- You told me you were doing laundry.
- I was.

611
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,614
And now you're here with Jess.

612
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,449
- And Paris.
- Jess, Rory!

613
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,409
I swear, I didn't...

614
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:04,661
- You didn't know he was coming over?
- I didn't.

615
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,080
- You also didn't know he'd stay?
- It just happened.

616
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,625
- How does that just happen?
- Well, he was...

617
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,961
And the diner was... And I...

618
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:15,005
And you what? Say something!

619
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,591
- Stop yelling.
- You totally lied to me.

620
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,718
- I didn't.
- Turn the situation around.

621
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,553
- How's it looking?
- Complicated...

622
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,639
- and I'm trying to explain it.
- That's crap.

623
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:26,475
- It's my fault.
- What?

624
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:28,936
It's my fault that Jess was here.

625
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,022
I saw him in the diner
the day I came to Stars Hollow...

626
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:34,608
and I thought he was cute,
and since I'm not great...

627
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:38,070
at the 'batting the eyelashes,
look at my belly shirt' kind of thing...

628
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,571
I asked Rory to help me.

629
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:43,700
I thought if she could maybe get him
over here, we'd have a chance to talk...

630
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,161
and I don't know.
It seems totally stupid now...

631
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:50,123
and it obviously didn't work, shock,
but that's why he was here.

632
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,460
- Thanks for trying to cover for me.
- That's okay.

633
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:55,212
Anyway, I should get going.

634
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:58,799
I'm probably gonna break out
in some sort of rash any second now.

635
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:07,432
- So Paris likes Jess.
- Yeah.

636
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,062
Rory, is this true?

637
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,440
- Yes, it is.
- Paris and Jess?

638
00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:18,402
I know. There's no explaining attraction.

639
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,113
Dean, listen to me.

640
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,576
If I was going to have anyone over tonight,
it definitely would have been you.

641
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,244
- Okay.
- Really?

642
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:31,290
If you say so,
then I have to believe it, don't I?

643
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,251
- Yes.
- Okay, then.

644
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,753
Sorry that I yelled.

645
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,464
Completely justified
under the circumstances.

646
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:42,551
- I gotta get going.
- No, wait.

647
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,220
Don't you wanna stay for ice cream?
We could hang out.

648
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:48,390
- No, I'm just gonna go.
- I'm still seeing you tomorrow, right?

649
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,850
Yeah, sure.

650
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,944
See you tomorrow.

651
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,415
- What was that?
- What?

652
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:15,792
That. The story. The save.

653
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,461
You helped me. Why would you do that?

654
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,046
I don't know. It just came out.

655
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,632
- You have no idea what you did.
- It was no big deal.

656
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:24,801
No, it was a very big deal.
It was a huge deal.

657
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,181
You helped me tonight
when you didn't want to, so I owed you.

658
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,350
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

659
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,020
Okay, I'll let you get back
to your alone night.

660
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:36,980
You should stay.

661
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:38,982
- Stay?
- Yeah.

662
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,068
We could hang out,
maybe watch some TV.

663
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:43,862
You can spend the night
if you don't want to drive back.

664
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:46,698
- Spend the night? Like a slumber party?
- Sort of.

665
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,243
You're doing this
'cause I lied to Dean for you, right?

666
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:52,037
I'm doing this because
it's what you do with friends.

667
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,372
We're friends?

668
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:56,416
I'm not sure if there's an exact definition
for what we are...

669
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,420
but I do think it falls somewhere
in the bizarro friends-ish realm.

670
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,840
- Come on, stay.
- Okay.

671
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:07,219
But if you're doing all this
so you can freeze my bra, I'll kill you.

672
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,470
Duly noted.

673
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:13,100
This is either the greatest steak
I've ever eaten...

674
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:14,560
or I'm so hungry, I'm delirious.

675
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,395
Pass the horseradish, please.

676
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,397
I never knew you were a spicy girl.

677
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,190
Believe me, I can handle my heat.

678
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,025
One summer when we were first married...

679
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:24,570
your father and I stayed
in this village in Thailand...

680
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,489
where we spent two weeks
eating viciously hot chilies...

681
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:28,949
- and skinny-dipping.
- Stop, Mom.

682
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,493
You couldn't put your clothes on
after eating those.

683
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:34,371
Stop it! I like to think of parents
the old-fashioned way.

684
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,622
In separate bedrooms.

685
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:39,168
And now it's time for my favorite part
of the evening:

686
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:42,504
Our salute to the Chairman of the Board.

687
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,965
I sure hope that's not B-O-R-E-D.

688
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:55,976
- Mom?
- Yes?

689
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:58,854
Remember the man
who wasn't staring at you?

690
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,063
He wasn't staring at me.

691
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,441
- Okay. Well, he's coming over.
- What?

692
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:04,943
Excuse me. I hope I'm not interrupting.

693
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:08,780
I couldn't help but notice that you two
are having more fun than anyone here.

694
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,741
- That's true. We are.
- Well, good.

695
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,744
I've come to the right place. Hi, I'm Chad.

696
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:17,164
Hi, Chad. I'm Lorelai.
This is my mother, Emily.

697
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:18,373
Your mother?

698
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:21,919
If your next words are,
'You can't possibly be old enough...

699
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:25,088
'to be her mother,'
I'll have to cause you severe physical pain.

700
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,134
Emily, do you share
this rather extreme opinion?

701
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,928
I think I'll stay out of it.

702
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,598
In that case, let me just say
that I think you look more like sisters...

703
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,184
than mother and daughter.
I went for a variation.

704
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,061
I'll let it slide this time.

705
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,980
- You two local or just visiting?
- Visiting.

706
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:45,651
- Mom's from Hartford, and I'm from...
- Hartford? Great town.

707
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:48,862
Little of the old, little of the new.

708
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:51,114
- You like living there?
- Yes, I do.

709
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:53,659
- And how about you? Where do you live?
- Here.

710
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,370
By here, I mean this very bar stool.

711
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:59,665
Admitting right off the bat
that you spend your life in a bar.

712
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,042
Do you find that people
are impressed by that?

713
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,627
Until now.

714
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,712
I love this song.

715
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,924
- It's a great song for dancing.
- Yes, it is.

716
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:13,512
- Help me out here, will you?
- I think he's asking you to dance.

717
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:16,515
What? No, I couldn't.

718
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,809
Rumor has it you love this song.

719
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,478
Yes, but I don't dance.

720
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,021
Come on, I can't believe that.

721
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,357
- I shouldn't leave my daughter alone.
- That's okay.

722
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,650
The sitter will be here soon.

723
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:28,652
I'm serious. You should ask someone else.

724
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:29,903
Is it my dancing?

725
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,447
Because you two can work out
some 'save me' signal...

726
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,158
in case I really embarrass you.

727
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:35,826
Go ahead, Mom. It'll be fun.

728
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,162
Come on, the song's almost over.

729
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,831
You'll hardly have to spend
any time at all with me.

730
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,083
All right.

731
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,486
- Your mom looks good out there.
- Yeah, she sure does.

732
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,277
I'm sorry, I have to go.

733
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:54,571
Mom?

734
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,078
- Mom, what's wrong?
- We're leaving.

735
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,038
- What happened?
- I shouldn't be doing this.

736
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,666
- Doing what?
- Fraternizing with other men.

737
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,919
- What are you talking about?
- I practically cheated on your father.

738
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:11,713
- You did not cheat on Dad.
- I danced with another man.

739
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:13,340
You've danced with other men before.

740
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,509
Not like that,
not without your father present.

741
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,636
It was just a dance. You were having fun.

742
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,013
I need to go. How hard is it to find a coat?

743
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:21,974
Mom, you didn't do anything wrong.

744
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:25,936
I don't know why I let you take me to
this chophouse. I don't go to chophouses.

745
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:28,021
- What were you thinking?
- Need food now?

746
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,399
I certainly don't eat at bars.
Hookers eat at bars.

747
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,776
- Only if they can't get a table.
- You're not funny.

748
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:35,612
You knew this made me uncomfortable
and yet you kept pushing.

749
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:37,656
I was trying to do everything right.

750
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,325
You manipulated me into taking this trip
and still I came.

751
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:43,328
You told me I was acting like a teenager
so I tried to be nicer.

752
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,539
You said you needed to eat
so I made that happen.

753
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:47,833
By sitting me at a bar
where you forced me...

754
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,710
to engage in inappropriate behavior.

755
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,962
- What?
- You let me get 60-40'd.

756
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:54,590
You are crazy. Do you know that?

757
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:58,635
We were having dinner, Mom,
a nice dinner. We were talking.

758
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,220
Hell, we were having fun.

759
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,806
Watching your mother
make an ass of herself is fun.

760
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,851
You don't have any right
to complain about this relationship...

761
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,396
if you don't wanna let your guard down
once in a while and just be normal.

762
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:12,191
There's a way for a mother to behave
with her daughter.

763
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:15,194
I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but that's how it is.

764
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,795
Come in.

765
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:38,550
I called the bellman to get the bags.
He said it would be 10 minutes.

766
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:41,470
- Thank you for agreeing to leave early.
- No problem.

767
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,722
I guess this whole thing
was a silly idea anyway.

768
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,057
I don't know why I pushed it.

769
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:46,934
We can't even have dinner without a fight.

770
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,436
What was I thinking,
putting us together for a weekend?

771
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,896
It was a nice thought, Mom.

772
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:53,398
I guess it's the thought that counts,
isn't it?

773
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,401
You know, if you want,
I can just bring our bags down.

774
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:58,737
They're not that heavy.
Then we don't have to wait.

775
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:00,739
Well, that sounds fine.

776
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:06,119
Why can't we have
what you and Rory have?

777
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,582
- Rory and I are different.
- We're mother and daughter.

778
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:13,043
You're mother and daughter.
It shouldn't be different.

779
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,712
It's completely different.
It couldn't be more different.

780
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:17,005
But why?

781
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:20,509
I grew up in a different environment.

782
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:24,221
- You mean an oppressive environment.
- No, I mean a different environment.

783
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:26,598
And plus, I was so young when I had Rory.

784
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:29,017
So because I waited
until I was grown and married...

785
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:31,019
I can't have a relationship
with my daughter.

786
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,063
- No.
- Well, then, why?

787
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:40,362
Rory and I are best friends, Mom.

788
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:44,950
We are best friends first
and mother and daughter second.

789
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,953
And you and I are
mother and daughter always.

790
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:50,330
I wasn't taught to be best friends
with my daughter.

791
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:51,415
I know.

792
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,917
I was taught to be a role model
for my daughter.

793
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,169
I know that, too.

794
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,255
I did what I thought was right,
what I had to do to protect you.

795
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:00,174
Because of this, we have no relationship.

796
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:03,010
- Mom, we have a relationship.
- We do?

797
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,304
What? What is our relationship?

798
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:09,474
- Well, we...
- Exactly.

799
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:15,606
Maybe an intense weekend together
was not the best idea for us.

800
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:19,526
Maybe we need to start
with something simpler.

801
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,988
- Like what? A brisk walk around the block?
- No, I hate exercise.

802
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:25,616
- Well, as long as you find this amusing.
- Mom.

803
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,952
Come on, there has to be something else.

804
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,415
- Something small.
- Like what?

805
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,840
Where are you going?
Lorelai, come back here.

806
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:45,052
You don't just walk out on a person.
That's rude.

807
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:48,347
- That's a robe.
- Yes. This is my robe.

808
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,642
And I want you to go into your room
and get your robe.

809
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:53,769
And then, exactly at the same time...

810
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,271
we're gonna shove these robes
in our suitcases...

811
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:58,857
and we're gonna walk out that door
and leave with them.

812
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,567
- That's stealing.
- Yes, it is.

813
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:03,111
You want me to steal?
That's how we're going to bond?

814
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:06,698
You love this robe. You've talked
about this robe since we got here.

815
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:09,409
So this robe will be symbolic
of our trip together.

816
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:12,538
Soon as they check the room,
they'll know the robes are gone.

817
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:15,415
- Then they'll charge our credit card.
- How do you know?

818
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,668
Because that's what the tag
on the hanger says.

819
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:22,214
The little tag on the hanger could be right,
or the little tag could just be there...

820
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:24,424
trying to scare us away from trying.

821
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,844
Either way,
whether we get away with it or not...

822
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:29,429
it's something we did. You and I.

823
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,181
You're serious.

824
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:35,602
- I'm folding this robe up.
- Lorelai.

825
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:39,189
- I'm putting this robe in my bag.
- That's lunacy.

826
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:41,900
I am zipping up the bag
that contains the robe.

827
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,612
- I have a perfectly good robe at home.
- The only question is...

828
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:47,489
am I doing it alone?

829
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:50,284
Did you ever steal a robe with Rory?

830
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:53,871
No, Rory would never steal.
She's far too moral for that.

831
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:56,415
You, however, vicious trollop...

832
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,084
what's it gonna be?

833
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,545
I should have my head examined.

834
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:03,463
We'll make an appointment
when we get back.

835
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,382
You do know in the course of one night...

836
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:08,093
you've turned me
into an adulterer and a thief.

837
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:10,262
I'll have you working
at the Chicken Ranch soon.

838
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,681
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

839
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:26,445
You actually got Grandma
to steal a bathrobe?

840
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,573
I did catch her trying to return it
while I was getting the car.

841
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:30,657
- Still.
- I know.

842
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:33,619
Life with my mother:
One step forward, 5,000 steps back.

843
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,621
It's kind of like the spastic polka.

844
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:38,123
- Excuse me. Are you done?
- No, sorry, not yet.

845
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:41,543
You're gonna eat half a piece of bacon
that's been there for 10 minutes?

846
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,837
You must be
if you're saying you're not done.

847
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:46,715
Because that's the only thing left.
Unless you eat plates.

848
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:48,634
- Go away.
- You're hogging the table.

849
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:50,969
- If you keep it up, I'm ordering seconds.
- Fine.

850
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:53,013
Paris looked a little green this morning.

851
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,891
She had a sugar-carb hangover
of monumental proportions.

852
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:59,728
People don't realize it, but it takes
years of training to eat the way we do.

853
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,314
- Don't I know it.
- So what's on the agenda for today?

854
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:05,567
Dean, Dean, and...
Oh, did I mention Dean?

855
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,653
Wow, he must have been
crazy mad last night.

856
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,571
I'd say that was a fair assessment.

857
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,156
I gotta get to the Inn.

858
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,034
Okay. I'm probably
gonna have dinner with Dean, so...

859
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:17,204
I'll have the house to myself tonight.
Life's funny, isn't it?

860
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:20,290
I simply cannot stop laughing.
I'll get the check.

861
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,583
Thanks, hon.

862
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:25,838
- Hey, Luke.
- What, you find a nail in your food?

863
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:29,091
I swear to God, Tom, you are dead.
You hear me? Dead!

864
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:31,343
There's nothing wrong
with the food, Luke.

865
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:32,469
Sorry, Tom.

866
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:34,471
- I just wanted to thank you.
- For what?

867
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:37,599
- The care package. That was sweet of you.
- What care package?

868
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:40,018
Luke, I think they hit the water line again.

869
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,021
What? Tom, you are dead.
You hear me? Dead!

870
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:47,484
- Interesting.
- You wanna pay?

871
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:50,070
I don't think Luke knew
about the food last night.

872
00:42:50,154 --> 00:42:51,738
That'll be $12.50.

873
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:53,198
You lied about why you came over.

874
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:55,617
I don't have any quarters.
I'll have to give nickels.

875
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:58,162
Why would you lie
about something like that?

876
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:00,330
Here's your change. Come again soon.

877
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:02,499
- You wanted to come.
- I have to get back to work.

878
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:05,586
You're squirming. I've never
seen you squirm. It's entertaining.

879
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,254
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

880
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:15,929
Rory's just inside paying.
She's coming out to meet you after.

881
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:19,016
- We're gonna spend the day together.
- That's great.

882
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:20,517
Yeah, it is.

883
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:24,897
So, listen, Rory told me everything
that happened last night.

884
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,858
- She feels just terrible about it.
- I know.

885
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,318
Good. You should.

886
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:33,405
'Cause it's just one of those freaky,
unfortunate things that happens.

887
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:35,949
Freaky and unfortunate. Yeah.

888
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:38,994
She had nothing to do
with Jess coming over, believe me.

889
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:42,080
- She did not want him there.
- That's what she told me.

890
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:45,375
Rory wouldn't lie, right?

891
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:48,795
No, Rory wouldn't lie.

892
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:34,299
English
