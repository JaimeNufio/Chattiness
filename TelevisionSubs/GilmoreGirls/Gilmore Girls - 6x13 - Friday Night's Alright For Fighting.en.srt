1
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:12,879
Hey.

2
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:13,805
Hey.

3
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,094
Did I wake you?
'Cause I brushed my teeth in the shower

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,219
so you wouldn't hear the sink run.

5
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:18,979
No, you didn't wake me up.

6
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,101
But then it occurred to me while I was
in the shower that you could
probably hear the shower run,

7
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:25,842
and that defeated the purpose of the
whole shower-toothbrush combo.

8
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:27,157
Why are you up so early?

9
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:28,834
Oh, well, you know me.

10
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:31,343
I do, so why are you up so early?

11
00:00:31,426 --> 00:00:32,630
I have chores.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,270
It's 6:00 in the morning.

13
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:35,915
Well, it's early morning chores.

14
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,591
What's early morning chores?

15
00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:42,735
You know, just milking cows,
feeding chickens, slopping pigs.

16
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:44,051
You have to slop pigs?

17
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:45,714
They're certainly not gonna slop themselves.

18
00:00:45,804 --> 00:00:47,238
You're being evasive.

19
00:00:47,358 --> 00:00:48,714
I'm not being evasive.

20
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:52,669
I'm trying to remain mysterious so you still
find me interesting 100 years from now.

21
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:54,487
Why won't you tell me where you're going?

22
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:57,297
Well... I'm going to the flower mart.

23
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:58,575
Why?

24
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:00,289
Because I'm meeting Sookie there because

25
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:03,865
we were going to get ideas for
flowers for the wedding...

26
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:05,318
Oh.

27
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:07,310
...That is now postponed.

28
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:08,277
Right.

29
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:12,284
But I forgot to call her last
night because I did, and, uh,

30
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:15,127
she's there now,
waiting for me to pick out flowers.

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,033
Sorry.

32
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,563
No. Hey. It's my bad.
I should have called her last night.

33
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:21,731
No, I meant I was sorry about the...

34
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:25,028
- You need a ride?
- No.

35
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:29,861
So, I should go.
She's probably already there, and--

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,091
Right. Go.

37
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:31,889
Okay.

38
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:32,651
I'll see you later.

39
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:33,587
Yes. Yes, you will.

40
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:35,070
Uh, can I help?

41
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:36,292
Help what?

42
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,452
- Help you.
- Help me what?

43
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,529
Cancel stuff.

44
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:39,534
Oh.

45
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:41,785
I mean, you shouldn't have to
do this all by yourself.

46
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:44,388
No, it's fine. I'm a great canceler.

47
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,480
I'm so smooth,
people think I'm still gonna show up.
I'm good.

48
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,030
But--

49
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:50,156
But I should really get going.
I'll see you later?

50
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:50,779
Tonight.

51
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:52,975
Yeah... unless I cancel.

52
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:53,708
Just kidding.

53
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:55,579
I'm not going to... oops.

54
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:56,913
Go back to sleep.

55
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,313
Hold on.

56
00:01:59,028 --> 00:01:59,617
Ow!

57
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:01,356
God, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

58
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:05,119
It's fine. It's okay. It hurts so good,
as Mr. Mellencamp said. Is it bleeding?

59
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:06,372
No, no.

60
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:08,878
Okay. That's okay.

61
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:10,002
I'll see you.

62
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:07,771
And what are those called?

63
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:08,552
Bluebells.

64
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,747
Ooh, bluebells, that sounds fancy.

65
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:12,046
And what are those?

66
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:13,396
Fairy wings.

67
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:15,330
Fairy wings-- so romantic.

68
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:16,509
Do they smell good?

69
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:18,366
Ohh. Terrible.

70
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:22,142
Fairy wings smell like a very different part
of the fairy, if you know what I mean.

71
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:22,958
Sookie!

72
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:24,958
Hi! Don't smell the fairy wings.

73
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:26,406
- Don't what?
- Never mind.

74
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,547
Sorry I'm so late.

75
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:30,840
That is okay.
It gave me a chance to scope out the place.

76
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:33,855
Sharon over there has great stuff,
but she is completely anti-haggle.

77
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:35,748
"This is my price, and you will pay it."

78
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:38,787
You know what? This is me walking
away from you over to Miguel's,

79
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:42,291
who's very haggle-friendly,
but his roses suck. Do you want roses?

80
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:42,782
Sookie--

81
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,986
Because if you don't,
I saw some bluebells over at Tim's

82
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:48,674
that I know are not your normal-bouquet
kind of choice,

83
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,287
but I think we can make something
interesting out of them.

84
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,697
- Sookie...
- Yes?

85
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,737
The wedding has been postponed.

86
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,138
What did you do?

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,392
What did I do?

88
00:03:57,492 --> 00:04:00,269
Did you get cold feet?
You can't get cold feet.

89
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:04,681
We need to put some nice wool socks on those
feet, because Luke is perfect for you.

90
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:05,441
I know.

91
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,136
He waited for you to get over Christopher.

92
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:08,400
He waited for you to get over Max.

93
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,193
Sookie.

94
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:10,360
Why do you do this?

95
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,448
Why do you want to make yourself miserable?

96
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:13,406
He has a kid.

97
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,977
- Who has a kid?
- Luke has a kid.

98
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:16,682
- Luke has a kid?
- Luke has a kid.

99
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,824
A kid, like a goat?

100
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:19,994
A kid, like a daughter. She's 12 years old.

101
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:23,304
He found out a few months ago,
and he just told me about her yesterday.

102
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,317
Holy moly.

103
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:26,173
He's completely in shock,

104
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:29,065
and he's trying to handle
it the best way he can.

105
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,272
- Drinking?
- No.

106
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:31,152
- Xanax?
- No.

107
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:33,394
He's trying to be a father,
and I applaud that.

108
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:37,092
So, for 12 years Luke's had a daughter
out there just walking around?

109
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:38,064
Yeah.

110
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,367
That is crazy! Oh, my god.

111
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:40,943
What?

112
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:42,552
I wonder if Jackson has a love child.

113
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:43,208
What?

114
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,715
I saw this kid wandering around
town the other day.

115
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,704
He looked exactly like Jackson,

116
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,272
and his voice was exactly like Jackson's,

117
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:52,980
plus he was holding a banana,
so I think he likes fruit.

118
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,979
Sookie, Jackson doesn't have
a son he doesn't know about.

119
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:57,273
Why not? Luke had a daughter he
didn't know anything about.

120
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,217
I know.

121
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,269
You think Luke's the only one with a past?

122
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:02,080
You think Jackson was a monk when I met him?

123
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:04,160
He had seed, and he passed it around.

124
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,154
Sookie...

125
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,431
Sorry. Right. Sorry.

126
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:08,429
So, how is Luke?

127
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:12,382
He's just trying to deal. I mean,
he wants to do the right thing by April.

128
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:13,898
That's her name-- April.

129
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:14,607
Pretty name.

130
00:05:14,642 --> 00:05:17,579
Yeah, he's just trying to figure everything
out, and the wedding was coming up so fast,

131
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,525
we decided to postpone it for a while.

132
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:20,644
- That sucks.
- No, it's okay.

133
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:24,289
It's fine.
It's just I have calls to make-- you know,
all the plans were made.

134
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,087
I'm a great dialer. What do you need?

135
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:29,953
I have to call the printer and the caterer
and the photographer and the--

136
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:31,680
and the church--

137
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:35,046
the perfect church that only
had one date available.

138
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,841
I knew it was all too easy.

139
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,240
I knew there had to be a catch.

140
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,436
No, there was not a catch.

141
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:43,435
Luke will get over the shock of this,
and he'll figure things out,

142
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:45,766
and everything will be back to a big
"go, go, go" again.

143
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:48,160
I know, Luke will figure it out.
Everything will calm down.

144
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:49,006
That's right.

145
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:52,267
I mean, it's all so fresh right now.
No one's thinking straight.

146
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,641
No, they're not.

147
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,761
I mean, he could wake up tomorrow
and feel completely differently
about things, next week, maybe.

148
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,516
Maybe.

149
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:02,327
You know, maybe I shouldn't cancel
everything right away.

150
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,868
I mean, I still have some time before
I lose my deposit on the hall.

151
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,531
Maybe I should just chill out
and-- and see what happens.

152
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:09,244
Is that crazy?

153
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,802
No, it's not crazy at all.

154
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,198
Okay. Then...

155
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,738
I'll wait?

156
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,129
Once more with feeling?

157
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,503
Okay, then, I'll wait.

158
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:17,603
Okay.

159
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,650
It's early. Let's get some coffee.

160
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:23,616
Are you talking about that Arnaz kid?

161
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:25,436
Yes! That's the one!

162
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:26,977
Well, he does talk like Jackson.

163
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:31,094
I know, and he even gets louder
at the end of his sentences!

164
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,510
That's weird.

165
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,943
I told you so.

166
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:40,672
Stop.

167
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:42,437
Look.

168
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:45,525
I don't remember that being there yesterday.

169
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:49,694
Yesterday you came from the other way,
so you missed the trash can,
but you almost took out the bike rack.

170
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,481
Thank god I have a guardian angel
hanging out by the coffee kiosk.

171
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:56,210
Well, it's the only place it's safe to stand
with a maniac like you walking around.

172
00:06:56,299 --> 00:07:00,058
Plus, here, I'm guaranteed to run into you
at least three times a day. Your usual.

173
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:02,625
You've been hanging out at this coffee
cart every day for a week.

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,835
Yes, it's sad. I'm officially a wuss.

175
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:06,820
If I saw me doing this,
I'd beat the crap out of myself.

176
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:08,407
You have nothing better to do with your time?

177
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:10,456
Nothing better than to try
and get you back, no.

178
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,150
You're too slick for your
own good, Huntzberger.

179
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:14,573
Excuse me. But this is not slick.
This is a Nora Ephron movie.

180
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,349
Louis Armstrong should be
warbling as we talk.

181
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:18,399
So come on. Please, put me out of my misery.

182
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:19,907
You promised you'd let me take you to dinner.

183
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,359
How 'bout Thursday night?

184
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:22,012
Really?

185
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:24,493
Yeah. I'll have turned in my
article for the Daily News,

186
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:26,786
and my Friday morning history
class was canceled this week.

187
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:28,881
Okay, great. Thursday it is-- 7:30.

188
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,493
And do not think of backing out,

189
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:34,711
because I will cry and eat a pint of rocky
road while watching "An Affair
to Remember" with Rita Wilson.

190
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:35,503
Of course.

191
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:36,134
7:30?

192
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:37,060
Can't wait.

193
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:38,287
Eyes on the road.

194
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:47,760
Paul Anka, mommy's home!
She comes bearing kibble!

195
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:49,919
Hey, where are you?!

196
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:53,568
Oh, no.

197
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:54,851
What have you done?

198
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,475
You're hiding.

199
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,808
That means you've done something weird.

200
00:07:57,922 --> 00:07:59,514
Oh, seriously?

201
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:03,266
You know, some dogs dig!
It might be a nice change of pace!

202
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,820
Hey, sugar. I heard some terrible crashing
sounds coming from your living room today.

203
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:10,632
I tried to get in,
but Luke fixed the back door,

204
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:12,949
so you can't jiggle it off the hinge anymore.

205
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:14,870
You should really talk to
him about that, sweetie.

206
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,888
I hope everything's okay.
Call me later if it's not. Bye-bye, toots!

207
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:21,852
Lorelai, it's your father.

208
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:26,932
I'm calling to tell you there's been a little
mistake with Rory's tuition at Yale.

209
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:28,955
Seems our check was returned to us.

210
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,194
For whatever reason, they did not cash it.

211
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:32,511
Now, don't worry.

212
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:34,966
I'm sure it's just some sort
of clerical mix-up.

213
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:37,648
I've been on the phone with the
bursar's office all morning.

214
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:41,241
I'm currently waiting for a call from a Mrs.
Linwood,

215
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:43,505
and then I'm sure I will
get this all cleared up.

216
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:44,962
Tell Rory not to worry.

217
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:47,731
If anyone gives her any trouble,
tell them to call me.

218
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,042
I will call you later.

219
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,266
Goodbye.

220
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:54,945
Hey, mom.

221
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,167
Oh, you got your study voice.

222
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:59,157
Yep. It goes with my pop-quiz
walk and my term-paper face.

223
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:01,109
- Oh. Five minutes?
- Go.

224
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:03,399
- I just got a call from your grandfather.
- Oh yeah?

225
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:07,122
He called to tell me that Yale returned his
check. He thinks it's a clerical error.

226
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:09,174
- It's not a clerical error.
- Nope.

227
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:10,413
They're gonna find out, kid.

228
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:10,983
Yep.

229
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:12,746
Getting charged by the word
on your calling plan?

230
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:13,924
What do you want me to say?

231
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:15,487
How 'bout "what do you think we should do?"

232
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,180
Nothing.

233
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,601
Rory, they're going to find out
Christopher is paying for Yale.

234
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:19,372
I know.

235
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,536
And they're not gonna like it.
It's gonna go over badly.

236
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,864
It's gonna be the opening night
of "taboo" all over again.

237
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,589
They had to find out eventually, mom.

238
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:28,505
Yes, but shouldn't they find out from you,
not some office clerk at Yale?

239
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:31,008
What's the worst that can happen?
We won't be speaking anymore?

240
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:32,033
Gee, that would suck.

241
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:34,067
Wow. Ice, ice, baby.

242
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:37,171
Sorry, not trying to be cold,
but I don't think I should feel guilty

243
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:39,131
because I want my father to pay for college.

244
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,368
No, you shouldn't,
but my parents do have feelings.

245
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:43,806
You saw my mom when the gardener
butchered her box hedges.

246
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,719
Okay, fine. I'll send them an e-mail.

247
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,705
Okay, fine, but you could also
call and tell them yourself.

248
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:51,279
It'll probably only cost you 75,
maybe 80 words.

249
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,277
Oh, no.

250
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:54,957
What "oh, no"? You saw a rat "oh,
no" or you cut off your thumb "oh, no"?

251
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:55,948
Paris.

252
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:56,842
Oh, no.

253
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,992
I have to call you back.

254
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,369
The point is vague.

255
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:01,546
The point is not vague.

256
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,854
The point is vague!
The conclusions are insane.

257
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:05,974
The conclusions are Johns Hopkins', not mine.

258
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:08,062
The research is sloppy,
the sources are unreliable,

259
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:09,731
the font is wrong, the paper feels thin,

260
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,623
and the by-line should read story
by a petulant 2-year-old

261
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:16,204
who had one too many black and tans
last night and so this is
what you people get to read."

262
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:17,290
Fix it!

263
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,617
I can't get anyone to write their names
on their cups and use them again.

264
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:27,059
It doesn't seem that hard.

265
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:29,034
Open sharpie, write name.

266
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:31,240
Maybe people don't want to reuse a paper cup.

267
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:33,976
Well, then, hopefully people who
don't want to reuse a paper cup

268
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:36,629
won't mind buying SPF 5000
for their grandkids

269
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,155
when the rainforest is gone and
the ozone layer is a doily

270
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:40,924
and the human race is bursting into flames.

271
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:43,412
Maybe we could just tell everyone
to bring a mug for their water.

272
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,065
We could, but they won't bring a mug,

273
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,413
just like they won't properly proof their
articles or double-check their sources.

274
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:50,795
Paris, did something happen? You seem upset.

275
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:53,992
I'm just dealing with the usual incompetence
around here. That's all.

276
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,225
What happened here?

277
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,219
Our pictures have sucked eggs lately,

278
00:10:57,314 --> 00:11:00,034
and so I sent out two photographers
to cover the same story.

279
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:02,913
They each came back with about 40
of the crappiest pictures ever

280
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,165
to have been committed to film.
Completely unusable

281
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:06,852
It was supposed to be a picture
of a football game.

282
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:07,689
I know.

283
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:10,851
Well, was there one with a guy
in a helmet holding a ball?

284
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,192
Because that's really all you need.

285
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:14,009
They were predictable and standard.

286
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:15,495
Guy in helmet holding ball.

287
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:18,956
Cover of the Harvard Crimson after the big
game-- guy with helmet holding ball.

288
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:21,260
Stanford game-- guy in helmet holding ball.

289
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:22,657
I wanted something more, okay?

290
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,684
Something that really said
something about the game.

291
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:25,879
Like "we forgot to go"?

292
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,978
And then, of course,
when the temperamental artistes found out

293
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,099
I had double-booked the gig,

294
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:32,965
they threw Naomi Campbell-level
hissy fits and quit.

295
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,359
So you just left it blank?

296
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:35,529
Why, to make them look bad?

297
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,708
Because it doesn't make them look bad.
It makes you look bad.

298
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:40,844
It was up to the sports editor to inform
me that no picture was approved.

299
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:43,664
You needed someone to remind you
you didn't approve a picture?

300
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:45,749
Hey, I have a million different
things I am doing here!

301
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:49,669
Paris, we cannot be publishing papers
that have blank spots in them,

302
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:51,316
and we cannot have all our photographers quit

303
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:53,336
because there's not an endless
supply of them.

304
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,037
Oh please. How hard is it to look through a
hole and push a button? I can do it myself.

305
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:58,253
How are you doing on your story?

306
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,924
Fine.
You'll have it first thing tomorrow morning.

307
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:02,140
Finally, one person I can count on.

308
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,227
These need more work.

309
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,072
These are locked.

310
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:05,986
Well, unlock them.

311
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:07,919
You've got entire paragraphs cut out.

312
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:09,350
This is hours of work.

313
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,989
The paper comes out tomorrow. I'd
have to track down every writer
and get them in here to rewr--

314
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:16,148
Then track them down, because those stories
are not going in the paper like that.

315
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:19,815
She's out of control.

316
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,388
She's a mad dictator.

317
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:23,405
She's the kind of dictator they
don't just like to kill.

318
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:24,914
She's the kind I'd like to
drag through the streets

319
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:27,039
and then hang from a lamppost
for a month and a half.

320
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:29,050
Let's just get this paper out.
Where's Sheila?

321
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:29,746
Sick.

322
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,468
- What about Joni?
- Sick.

323
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,801
There's an awful lot of sickness
going on around here lately.

324
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,096
Yes, there certainly is, and there's probably
going to be a lot more very soon.

325
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:40,615
Michelle? Bill.

326
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,485
Well, I just talked to Paris,
and you know what that means.

327
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,382
Easy-- just the messenger.

328
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:02,850
Hello?

329
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:04,177
Hi, dad. It's Lorelai.

330
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:05,278
- Lorelai?
- Mom?

331
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,458
- Emily?
- Richard?

332
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:07,513
Rowan? Martin?

333
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:08,752
Lorelai called me, Emily.

334
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:09,880
She did? What for?

335
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:11,133
I don't know. She hasn't told me yet.

336
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:12,770
Lorelai, why did you call your father?

337
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:14,552
Well, I just wanted to know how he was doing.

338
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:15,475
I'm doing fine.

339
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:16,908
Very glad to hear that.

340
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:19,777
All right. It's good of you to check in.

341
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,735
Goodbye, Lorelai.

342
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:21,805
Whoa, guys, wait.

343
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,719
Is there more?

344
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,906
More than the nothing there just was?
Yes, there's more.

345
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:28,538
Hurry up, please.
I'm meeting Bill Chandler at the club,
and I'm late.

346
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:29,601
Okay.

347
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:34,240
Well, I just wanted to tell you that there
was no mistake with your Yale check.

348
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,959
There wasn't?

349
00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:39,228
No, they sent you back your check because
Yale has already been paid for.

350
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:40,092
By whom?

351
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:41,411
By Christopher.

352
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:42,377
Christopher who?

353
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:45,295
Christopher Isherwood. That "cabaret" money
was burning a hole in his pocket.

354
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,190
You know what Christopher, mom.

355
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:51,745
His grandfather passed away recently
and left him some money,

356
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:55,138
and he just wanted to do something for Rory.

357
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:57,254
He's trying to be a dad for once.

358
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,643
I thought it seemed like a good idea.

359
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:02,139
Hello?

360
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:03,185
Guys, are you there?

361
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:04,328
I'm here, Lorelai.

362
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:05,607
Your mother had to go.

363
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:07,919
Oh, dad,
please don't read too much into this.

364
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,725
I mean, when was the last time Christopher
wanted to do anything for Rory?

365
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:14,010
He wants to contribute. This is a good thing.

366
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:16,755
This is not a snub, dad, I swear.

367
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:21,278
Rory and I are so grateful for everything
you and mom have done--

368
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:23,289
all the help you've given her.

369
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:26,187
She would not be in Yale right
now if it weren't for you,

370
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:28,397
and she would never have gone to Chilton.

371
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:32,262
She would have graduated Stars Hollow High
and then gone to community college

372
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:33,666
and then beauty school.

373
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,816
I have to go, Lorelai.

374
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,612
Dad!

375
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:37,233
I appreciate the phone call.

376
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:41,913
I simply wish it had come before I called
every person in the bursar's office a moron.

377
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,374
Well... if it will make you feel any better,

378
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:47,085
odds are,
at least two of them truly deserved it.

379
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:50,428
I can't believe you didn't dress
crazy like we agreed.

380
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:51,973
We never agreed to dress crazy.

381
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,962
What are you talking about? We did so,

382
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,043
on the phone last night when
we made our lunch plans.

383
00:14:56,131 --> 00:15:00,180
You saying, "hey, let's dress crazy," does
not equate to us agreeing to dress crazy.

384
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:01,645
For years, it did.

385
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,879
Well, for years,
you bought my clothes for me,
so I had very little choice in the matter.

386
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,043
Oh, so typical--

387
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,789
kid grows up, goes to a fancy school,
becomes a snob,

388
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,970
and is suddenly ashamed of her mother.
You totally mildred pierced me.

389
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,276
I did not mildred pierce you.

390
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:14,816
Oh, you'll miss me when I'm gone.

391
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:15,804
Oh, my god.

392
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:18,516
Just an observation.
The food here has gotten worse. Ooh, coffee!

393
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:19,676
You have coffee in your hand.

394
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:21,712
I know, but by the time she makes a new one,
the old one will be gone.

395
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:22,722
Okay, two, please.

396
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:24,346
Two double cappuccinos, please.

397
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:26,713
Thanks for having lunch with me.

398
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:27,628
Well, you paid.

399
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:29,079
- So, guess what.
- What?

400
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:31,538
I'm having dinner with Logan tonight.

401
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:33,599
So, he finally wormed his way back in, huh?

402
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:34,434
He did, at that.

403
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,830
Is he taking you someplace fabulous?

404
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:36,611
Odds are.

405
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:37,968
Want to borrow my scarf?

406
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:39,377
Wait for the wedding night?

407
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,320
You got it. Ooh, thank you, ma'am.

408
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,845
Well, I talked to your grandparents
last night.

409
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:45,272
Oh, so now they're my grandparents.

410
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,235
I told them about Yale.

411
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,073
- Good.
- Good?

412
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:47,953
I'm glad.

413
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:49,407
You're glad I told them or
you're glad they know?

414
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,292
Both.

415
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,662
So you want to know how they took it?

416
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,230
- No.
- They took it great.

417
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,669
Mom practically broke the phone,
she hung up so hard,

418
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:59,097
and dad-- well, dad was solemn, quiet, sad.

419
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:00,655
It was a huge success.

420
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:02,799
Okay, here's how I see it--

421
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:06,346
you and your grandparents are at a huge
crossroads, a precipice, if you will.

422
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,751
They are the bridges of Madison county,
and you are Meryl Streep.

423
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,988
As the paper pages go flying
off the calendar.

424
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:13,438
Hey, listen to me. I'm serious here.

425
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,232
I know you and your grandparents are playing
the "who can freeze out who the longest?"

426
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:17,920
Which I know can be fun,

427
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:20,367
but if you ever hope to have a
relationship with them again,

428
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,482
then someone needs to make the first move.

429
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,000
I remember the first Christmas
after we left Hartford.

430
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:29,339
We were at the Independence Inn, and I got an
invitation to their annual Christmas party,

431
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:34,413
and I didn't go, and that one move defined
our entire future relationship.

432
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,942
I mean, if I had gone,
it would have been awful,
but it would have broken the ice,

433
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:39,480
and maybe-- and I know this
is a big "maybe"--

434
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:43,553
but maybe we would have been
a tad closer than we are now

435
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:45,361
or could ever hope to be.

436
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,801
Maybe, maybe not.

437
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:48,778
I just know how much you
love your grandparents

438
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:51,538
and how important to you it was to
have a relationship with them,

439
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:54,921
and I don't want the fact that you inherited
my stubbornness to screw that up.

440
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:56,102
Okay, I hear you.

441
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:59,115
Do you? Because my scarf is screaming
as loud as it can.

442
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:00,173
I will think about it.

443
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:03,585
All right. You have till 6:45 Friday night,
then we're having dinner with them.

444
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:05,126
- What?!
- I made the plans last night.

445
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:05,727
But--

446
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:11,086
Come on, Rory.
Friday night dinners, cocktails, Mozart,
mind games-- good times.

447
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:12,824
Yeah, but I'm not so sure about this.
I mean--

448
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:15,734
Rory, Mom already said she's really
into this. You can't back out now.

449
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:16,452
She is?

450
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:17,145
Yeah.

451
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,656
Grandma said she was into this?

452
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,075
Well, you know, she didn't say it like that,
but she said,

453
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:24,673
"Oh! Dinner with Rory! How delightful!

454
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:27,186
Well, spit-spot. Alert the corgis."

455
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:27,928
Mom...

456
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:30,279
Yes, yes, she's into it.
Now, what do you say?

457
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:31,147
Okay.

458
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,408
Okay?

459
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,630
Do you want to wear my scarf to dinner?

460
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,205
I know you do.

461
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:42,069
Bill.

462
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,103
Well, look who's all dressed up for the ball.

463
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,118
I sent in my story this morning.
I never got a confirmation call.
Did you get it?

464
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:47,977
Yep.

465
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:50,565
Well, no one called me in for a final edit,

466
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:53,031
and I need to finish this up now.
I have a date tonight.

467
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:55,437
So, who is the copy editor on my piece?

468
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,591
That would be Michael.

469
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,397
Well, where is Michael and everyone else?

470
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:00,615
Well, let's see.

471
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:03,493
The sports department, city department,
entertainment department,

472
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:05,865
and feature department, other than you,
have quit.

473
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,697
Michael quit.

474
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,507
Sylvia quit. Joni quit.

475
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:11,188
Sheila's sick tonight,
but as soon as she's better,
she's going to quit.

476
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:11,852
Great.

477
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:12,823
Oh, not done.

478
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:14,102
The senior editor quit.

479
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,264
The entire copy department quit.

480
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:18,709
The little fellow who brought around
sandwiches in the basket quit.

481
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:20,723
Okay, fine, I get it. Everyone quit.

482
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:21,978
Not everyone, but close.

483
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:24,846
It was quite an exodus-- very biblical.

484
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:27,082
All that was missing were the cabala
bracelets and the matzo.

485
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:28,557
Whatever. We'll figure that out later.

486
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:32,531
Right now I just need to finish my article,
so I guess you and I can do it together.

487
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:34,575
We could, but I quit, too.

488
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:35,032
What?

489
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:36,005
Right after Joni.

490
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:37,025
I bowed out.

491
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:39,751
I actually bowed-- physically bowed.

492
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:41,465
Well, if you quit,
then what are you doing here?

493
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:42,501
Are you kidding?

494
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,524
I'm going to have a ringside seat
for the event of the century.

495
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:49,844
Tonight will be the first time ever in
the history of the Yale Daily News

496
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:51,257
that the paper does not come out.

497
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:51,986
Very nice.

498
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,380
D-Day-- the paper came out.

499
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,257
Kennedy gets shot-- the paper comes out.

500
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:57,602
But three months of the
Geller reign of terror,

501
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,041
and the whole damn institution
comes tumbling down.

502
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,313
You suck, Bill.

503
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,605
Paris?

504
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,215
Holy crap.

505
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:11,330
I can't talk now.

506
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:13,293
What happened to this place?

507
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:15,425
There's no air in here or light.

508
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,983
Where are your fire exits?
You love fire exits.

509
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:19,319
No one can write a lead--

510
00:19:19,412 --> 00:19:20,398
no one.

511
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:22,836
Paris, do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

512
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,913
I can't think about that now.

513
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:26,834
Half the staff has quit.
No, more than half the staff has quit--

514
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,541
and there's no one out there working.

515
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,035
There's no one out there working when
there's people out there working.

516
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:32,535
Ship of fools!

517
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:35,040
Paris, the paper's not gonna come out.

518
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:35,884
Of course it is.

519
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:37,126
How? Nothing's done.

520
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:38,049
I'm working on it.

521
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:38,779
Alone?

522
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:39,890
I can do it alone.

523
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:43,010
I've been doing it alone for months.
No man is an island, but this woman is.

524
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:43,878
But, Paris--

525
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,563
I've got it all scheduled out.

526
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:48,325
As long as I stick to the schedule,
everything's going to be fine.

527
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:51,676
I'm finishing up a review of the drama club's
production of "sweeney todd" now.

528
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:55,064
Then 9:30 to 10:00,
I'm gonna finalize the layout.

529
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,813
10:00 to 11:00-- copy editing.

530
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,056
- 11:00 to 12:30--
- Let me see that.

531
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:03,841
Paris, there's like 100 hours of work on this
and 5 hours till the paper comes out.

532
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:04,541
We'll get it done.

533
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:07,654
You better get bitten by that radioactive
spider pretty damn fast here.

534
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:11,264
I'll get it done. I just have to focus and
stop allowing myself to be distracted.

535
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:11,897
Paris!

536
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:13,581
Don't distract me!

537
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,496
Okay, everyone, listen up.
We have work to do.

538
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,046
You, t-shirt-- you're doing layout.

539
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,570
And, you, saggy pants--

540
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,961
get all the heelers' numbers, call them,
and tell them to get in here.

541
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:37,993
They've just been promoted.

542
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:41,908
And Tally,
I need Sheila and Joni's numbers ASAP.

543
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:43,768
Come on, people! Move!

544
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,340
We've got a paper to get out!

545
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:51,830
I just think that if Michel had somebody
to come home to, he might go home.

546
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,824
Oh, he's been driving me crazy about
turning the stable into a spa.

547
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,261
What would we do with the horses?

548
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,435
Well, we'd work them in.

549
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:59,625
We'd have the first hot-hoof
massage on the east coast.

550
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,340
'Cause they've already got
them in California.

551
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,478
Hi, Paul Anka.

552
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:06,471
You haven't done anything weird yet today,
I see. Do you remember Sookie?

553
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:09,626
Hi, Paul Anka.
You're gonna come spend the night with me.

554
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:10,662
Are you sure this is okay?

555
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:11,801
Yeah, it's fine.

556
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,762
We think a dog would be good for Davey.

557
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:17,330
He loves them. I just want to make sure that
Jackson and I are dog people first.

558
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:18,405
Aw, you are.

559
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:20,687
I mean, I know babies, but dogs...

560
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:23,209
Are just furry babies.
Keep him occupied for a second.

561
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:28,303
Hi, Paul Anka. You want to come have
a sleepover at my house, huh?

562
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:30,076
What are you doing?

563
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:31,717
Uh, freaks out if he sees his leash.

564
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,484
You have to make sure you hide it from him,

565
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:35,571
make sure he doesn't see
you putting it on him.

566
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:36,841
How is he once he's on the leash?

567
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:39,759
Oh, he's totally fine having his personal
freedom slowly stripped away

568
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,647
as long as he's completely unaware that it's
happening, just like a true American.

569
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:43,981
- It's all yours.
- Thanks.

570
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,620
Come on, Paul Anka.
We're gonna have fun tonight. Yes, we are.

571
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,378
Hey, it's me.
I hope you had a good day with Rory.

572
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,772
I would have called you earlier,
but I didn't want to interrupt the fun,

573
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:55,667
so I thought I'd try you at home,
but you're not at home.

574
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:59,021
Anyhow, April is coming to the diner
tonight from 5:00 to 8:00,

575
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:00,698
so I'll see you here after 8:00.

576
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,901
Okay, bye.

577
00:22:02,892 --> 00:22:04,028
After 8:00?

578
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:05,973
Yeah, that's what he said.

579
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:08,872
So, I guess you two decided that
you're not gonna see the kid.

580
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:11,043
Yeah, I guess we did.

581
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:13,643
Hey, if we get a dog,
we're gonna name it Chef.

582
00:22:13,754 --> 00:22:15,150
Get it? 'Cause I'm a cook.

583
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:15,920
Oh, cool.

584
00:22:16,023 --> 00:22:17,053
You want me to leave Paul Anka?

585
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:18,907
No, take him. I'm great.

586
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:19,689
You are?

587
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:21,583
Yeah, I think that's what we decided.

588
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,441
Come on. Come on.

589
00:22:24,534 --> 00:22:25,383
Bye, hon.

590
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,857
One sample per person,
people-- one sample only.

591
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:46,012
Don't make me use the candy
thermometer on you.

592
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,973
Hey.

593
00:22:57,163 --> 00:22:58,036
There's a line.

594
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,477
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just--

595
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:01,933
- I know what you were doing.
- No, I wasn't doing anything.

596
00:23:01,976 --> 00:23:03,374
You're trying to shove in
for the free chocolate.

597
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:05,733
I wasn't trying to-- free chocolate, really?

598
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:08,540
European hot chocolate.
It's like mud but chocolaty.

599
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:11,389
- And you were trying to--
- Oh, can it, Ruthie.

600
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:13,755
When your foot's not in your mouth,
you don't know what to do with yourself.

601
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:15,941
Come on, sugar. Two, Kirk.

602
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,073
You'll have to wait in line--

603
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:18,994
Here, doll. Cheers.

604
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:19,900
Cheers.

605
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:24,248
Oh, Patty,
did I tell you about Tilly's new face-lift?
Scotch tape.

606
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:40,477
- What are we looking at?
- Oh, I--

607
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,714
Oh, I know what we're looking at.

608
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:44,161
We're looking at Luke and his daughter.

609
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,986
How did you know that?

610
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:47,213
Oh, please, that was page-one
news around here for a week.

611
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,280
So, what's the scoop?

612
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:49,467
Well, I don't know.

613
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,562
All we know is that she's 12 years old
and that she's seeking him out.

614
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,081
I heard her mother was that Nardini girl.
You remember her?

615
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,641
Oh, yeah. She was beautiful.

616
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,549
What's she look like now?

617
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,203
I don't know.

618
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,210
- You don't?
- Well, I--

619
00:23:59,253 --> 00:24:02,982
You know, Luke was pretty serious about her.
He tell you about them?

620
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:05,147
No, but I don't tell him about
my boyfriends either.

621
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,235
Well, no,
because he's met all of them already.

622
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:08,654
He hasn't met all of them-- some.

623
00:24:08,718 --> 00:24:09,420
Most.

624
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,019
Well, what's the kid like?

625
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:12,340
Yeah. You get along?

626
00:24:12,448 --> 00:24:13,804
Oh, well, we will.

627
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:14,788
You mean you don't know?

628
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:16,727
That's to be expected.

629
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,445
She looks like a reader. Is she a reader?

630
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:20,559
Can you imagine Luke with a reader?

631
00:24:20,664 --> 00:24:22,172
Oh, I can't imagine Luke with a daughter.

632
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:23,453
Can you imagine Luke with a kid?

633
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:26,464
Oh, my god, I can't believe that.
Luke has a kid.

634
00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:27,994
Can you believe Luke has a kid?

635
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,518
He's not a 100-year-old eunuch or anything.

636
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:32,953
There's other people here
who would like a table.

637
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:34,678
We're busy. Go lick the empties.

638
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:36,229
- Busy doing what?
- Nothing, nothing.

639
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,580
We're looking at Luke's kid.

640
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:38,280
Patty!

641
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,657
Well, honey, everyone knows.

642
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:41,443
That's her?

643
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:43,001
- Luke's kid?
- Up at the counter.

644
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,440
Lorelai was just about to
give us the inside scoop.

645
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,426
- I was not about to give you--
- So, do they want money?

646
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:48,358
I don't think so.

647
00:24:48,396 --> 00:24:51,443
Do you think that Luke's gonna get a lawyer?
That he wants custody?

648
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,364
Are you sure that's his kid? She's reading.

649
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:57,026
You're clogging up the flow here.

650
00:24:57,114 --> 00:24:58,856
We're looking at Luke's kid.

651
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:00,635
So that's Luke's kid.

652
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:03,877
Well, well, well, what is she reading,
a book?

653
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:08,029
Excuse me. Pardon me. Yeah.

654
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:22,755
Okay. No, yes, done, go.

655
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:25,750
And triple-check the changes.
Make sure it makes sense.

656
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,755
How are we doing?

657
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:29,934
I have a very strong opinion that I have
no opinion on the opinion piece.

658
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,836
And the subject is?

659
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:32,215
Hand blowers in the bathrooms.

660
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,686
And the Pulitzer prize goes to?

661
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,273
Just make sure it's done in 20 minutes.

662
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:37,018
Printer's on the phone.
We're losing our spot.

663
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,863
Hello? Who am I speaking to?

664
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,968
Hello, Russell. This is Rory Gilmore.

665
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:43,048
What's this I hear about us losing our spot?

666
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,027
Yes.

667
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:46,579
Well, we had an epidemic
hit our staff this week,

668
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:48,754
and, unfortunately,
it has put us a bit behind.

669
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:50,964
However, we are quickly
getting back on track,

670
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,954
and maybe, considering the circumstances,
you could cut us a little slack,

671
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:56,872
give us a bit of an extension.

672
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:59,805
I know, but we've never asked for it before,
and we will never ask for it again.

673
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:02,590
By the way,
you sound like a very handsome man, Russell.
Do you work out?

674
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:07,058
Yes, I'm using my wiles and everything
else I can to get you to-- one hour.

675
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,747
I'll take it. Thank you, Russell.

676
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:11,754
You have a slightly inappropriate Christmas
card coming your way this year. Bye.

677
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,885
We have a one-hour extension!

678
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:17,880
That one and use them both
if we need to fill space.

679
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:20,847
Hey, I was cat's-cradling!

680
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:22,774
Bill, get your ass out of that chair and work

681
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:24,252
or get your ass out of that chair and leave.

682
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,684
Either way, get your ass out of that chair.

683
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:27,941
I am not interested in helping
Paris do anything.

684
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,689
You wouldn't be helping Paris.
You would be helping me.

685
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,233
Fine. If Punxsutawney Phil sticks her head
out of her hole, I am out of here.

686
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:35,558
Interested in some desking?

687
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,587
I'm on it.

688
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:38,069
Computer crashed again.

689
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:40,573
Unplug it and plug it back in.
If that doesn't work, call IT.

690
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:42,039
and get someone over here now.

691
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:43,786
Oh, my god.

692
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:46,404
Our date. I'm so sorry.

693
00:26:46,497 --> 00:26:50,093
Paris melted down and everyone quit and
the paper wasn't gonna come out,

694
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:53,493
and I only found out about it because no one
called me to confirm they got my story,

695
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:57,084
so I called in all the heelers,
and I got Sheila and Joni to come in,

696
00:26:57,174 --> 00:27:00,890
and I called Pete, who said he was sick,
but I threatened his job, so he came in,

697
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:03,933
but he was really sick, so I just sent him
home so he didn't get everyone else sick.

698
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:07,534
Plus, the printers are trying to give our
time away, the computers keep crashing,

699
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:10,688
and then there's the tiny little
detail of nothing's done.

700
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:13,529
And D-Day, the paper came out, and I forgot.

701
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:14,536
I'm sorry.

702
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:15,908
I can't believe you didn't call me.

703
00:27:15,983 --> 00:27:17,612
I know, but it's just paper stuff.

704
00:27:17,696 --> 00:27:19,059
I know. I'm on the paper.

705
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:20,078
You hate it here.

706
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:23,921
I know this crap backwards and
forwards. I can't believe you
didn't even think to call me.

707
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:26,769
Well, I'm sorry.
I just didn't think you were interested.

708
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:29,731
I guess you don't know everything, now,
do you? So come on, what have you got here?

709
00:27:29,837 --> 00:27:31,754
Well, this is an article on Greenspan.

710
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:35,045
He gave an interview with all this
technical economic jargon.

711
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,342
I know the jargon. I'll take this.
Are these proofed?

712
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:38,856
Yeah, but they're not typed in yet.

713
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,947
I'll do that. I'll be fast.
I type 90 words a minute.

714
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:41,636
You do?

715
00:27:41,738 --> 00:27:43,550
You really did only like
me for my looks, huh?

716
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:44,550
How you doing on content?

717
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,908
Uh, still a little short.

718
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:48,465
Okay. I got a couple stories banked
that I didn't give Paris.

719
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:50,265
They are in pretty decent shape.
Maybe take a look at them.

720
00:27:50,363 --> 00:27:51,842
And just remember,
if you still need material,

721
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,961
just cannibalize everything you have ready
for Friday's issue and use it for tonight.

722
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,521
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

723
00:27:56,629 --> 00:27:57,894
Peter's asking for it.

724
00:27:57,929 --> 00:27:59,673
Okay. So, who do you have desking?

725
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:00,641
Bill.

726
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:03,620
I'd throw Sheila on there with him. It will
hurt his ego and make him work faster.

727
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,461
Okay, I'll be over here if you need me.
And get that yo-yo off the floor.

728
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,192
Somebody's gonna break their neck.

729
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,707
I mean, can you believe she reads?

730
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:17,334
I have a kid who reads.

731
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:18,254
Crazy!

732
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:21,438
She sat there for hours doing
her homework-- geometry.

733
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,730
That's some crazy stuff.

734
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:24,961
I actually bought a book,
"geometry for dummies."

735
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:27,986
I stash it in the kitchen and run back there
every time she asks me a question,

736
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:31,396
thinking I can keep up with her,
but I can't figure out what the hell it says.

737
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:34,894
I mean, it's just this mess of
weird symbols and shapes and--

738
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:36,789
I wonder if there's another book I could get.

739
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:39,216
Um, "'geometry for dummies' for dummies"?

740
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:40,321
Yes, exactly.

741
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,166
Luke, she has teachers.

742
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,763
All you have to do is nod and smile.
That's what I did with Rory.

743
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,196
I just want her to, you know,
not be embarrassed I'm her dad.

744
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,342
Impossible.

745
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:53,062
Well, step by step-- first step,
making sure she's comfortable around me.

746
00:28:53,116 --> 00:28:54,728
She sure seems to be--

747
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:58,861
I mean, you know, 'cause she's coming
here and hanging out at the diner.

748
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:00,412
She wouldn't do that if
she was uncomfortable.

749
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,080
Yeah, well, she's gonna be with this
village of idiots I live in.

750
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:06,466
Do you know tonight,
she comes to the diner, right?

751
00:29:06,553 --> 00:29:08,504
She's sitting at the counter,
doing her homework there.

752
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:10,325
I look over at the soda shoppe,

753
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:13,555
and the whole damn town is staring
through the window at us.

754
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:14,136
No!

755
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:15,784
Oh yeah. Like we're monkeys in a zoo.

756
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:16,778
I could have killed them all.

757
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:18,063
That's terrible. What happened?

758
00:29:18,164 --> 00:29:20,491
Nothing. She didn't notice anything.
She was too busy studying.

759
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:22,508
I just couldn't believe those people.

760
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:25,496
Can't they get that this is a private thing,
I'm trying to get to know my kid?

761
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:28,607
I mean, you understand,
you're not all over me about this.

762
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:30,423
You get that we need some alone time.

763
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,366
Oh, yeah, I do. I totally do.

764
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:33,402
Thank you.

765
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:35,440
Sure. Any time.

766
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:41,302
Did we verify the dean of admissions quote?

767
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:42,881
Twice. How are we doing on time?

768
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:44,266
Uh, bad.

769
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,933
- More specifically?
- 10 minutes.

770
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:46,721
We'll make it.

771
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,237
We'll make it. Spelling on name-- it's
Cheevers' name-- C-H--

772
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:51,817
E-E-V-E-R-S.

773
00:29:51,913 --> 00:29:52,979
You're sure about the double E's?

774
00:29:53,037 --> 00:29:54,121
Not at all.

775
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,130
Two E's it is. Okay. And I'm done.

776
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,352
Close out.
I'll cut and paste it to the final copy.

777
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,581
Closing out. Wow!
So, that's what hard work feels like.

778
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,732
Apparently I've been avoiding it
for a reason. You're in, ace?

779
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:07,191
I'm in. Proceeding with the cut & paste now.

780
00:30:08,884 --> 00:30:10,493
Aw, man.

781
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:11,621
Why are you smiling?

782
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,985
I'm thinking about the hundreds of different
ways you owe me for this.

783
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,820
I owe you nothing.
You did this for the greater good.
For the glory of the paper.

784
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:19,042
For a foot massage.

785
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:19,792
Are we close?

786
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:20,819
Very, very close.

787
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:24,169
Well, kids, hold on to your hats.
We are losing our printing time.

788
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,553
No! Remind Russell about the Christmas card.

789
00:30:27,652 --> 00:30:29,753
I don't think he cares.
He's giving it to the cart.

790
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:30,690
No, he can't!

791
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:31,737
He did.

792
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:33,679
So, that's it?

793
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,509
We just lose? After all this work,
we just lose?

794
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:37,514
Keep typing, ace.

795
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:38,522
Why? What's the point?

796
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,587
Type!

797
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:41,480
Well, I guess you'll be talking
on the phone now.

798
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:42,524
Go away, Bill.

799
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:44,303
Hey, who am I speaking with?

800
00:30:44,503 --> 00:30:46,350
Russell, I'm Logan Huntzberger.

801
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:48,703
Yes, those Huntzbergers.

802
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,454
It's great to speak with you, too.

803
00:30:50,568 --> 00:30:53,567
I hear there's a problem
with our printing time?

804
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:55,748
Uh-huh. No, I completely understand.

805
00:30:55,846 --> 00:30:57,670
The first thing I learned from my
father is that there's no paper

806
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,112
unless it gets to the printer on time.

807
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:02,424
Yes, he is quite a legend, my father.
I'd love to introduce you to him sometime.

808
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:07,791
Anyway, Russell, the thing is we actually
sent the issue to you already.

809
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,857
Oh. Yes, at least 15 minutes ago.

810
00:31:11,966 --> 00:31:13,272
Now, if you're having a problem
with your server,

811
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:15,125
we shouldn't be penalized for that, right?

812
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:16,844
Yeah, it should be in the system right now.

813
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:18,369
Sure. Go check.

814
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:22,662
But before you do,
if you could spell your name for me--

815
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:25,334
I want to have the correct pronunciation
when I speak with my father.

816
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:26,402
Uh-huh, Russell.

817
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,066
Damn! My pen broke.

818
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:30,992
Hold on. I'm looking for a pen.

819
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:32,828
I'm looking for a pen.

820
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:35,227
Looking for a pen.

821
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,261
Almost there.

822
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:38,370
Okay. I found a pen.

823
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,254
Here we go. What's your name?

824
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:41,825
"Russell Smith."

825
00:31:41,922 --> 00:31:44,634
Okay, I didn't really need a pen
for that one, now, did I?

826
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:48,654
Okay, Russell Smith,
if you go to your computer,

827
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:55,641
I am definitely,
absolutely sure that you will turn it on

828
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,580
and you will see that we,
the Yale Daily News,

829
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:01,232
have successfully completed our mission

830
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:06,696
and sent to you our e-mail containing
the latest issue of the--

831
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,454
It's all there, man.

832
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:13,736
What? What's happening?

833
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:15,129
You got it? All right, great.

834
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,537
It's been great speaking with you, too.
I'll tell my father. Bye.

835
00:32:18,084 --> 00:32:20,474
And that's how we do it at the Daily News!

836
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:25,467
All right!

837
00:32:25,566 --> 00:32:26,738
We got the paper out!

838
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:29,186
That's what I'm talking about, people!
Good hustle!

839
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:30,348
Really good hustle!

840
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:32,331
And they said we couldn't do it, huh?

841
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,174
Boy, what a rush, right?!

842
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:40,585
So, I'm just saying that when that
giant asteroid heads toward earth,

843
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,279
I want you in that fighter jet.

844
00:32:42,384 --> 00:32:43,595
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

845
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:44,810
You saved my ass.

846
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,490
Infinitely worth saving.

847
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:47,338
Thank you.

848
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:48,556
You're welcome.

849
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,675
I'm sorry we didn't get our dinner.

850
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,721
We didn't.

851
00:32:58,634 --> 00:32:59,540
Huh.

852
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,175
I thought that we did.

853
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:20,975
Boy, when you're on...

854
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:28,128
Once upon a time, there was a big
house with thick glass windows

855
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:31,675
and heavy stone walls and a slightly
pornographic fountain in the driveway.

856
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:34,977
And all the animals in the forest
were scared of the house

857
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:36,925
'cause they thought that
the house was haunted,

858
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:42,152
and so did all the villagers in the
small hamlet of Hartfordshireville.

859
00:33:42,282 --> 00:33:45,264
"Maids go in, but they never come out,"
they would whisper on the street.

860
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,058
How are we doing?

861
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,247
Keep going.

862
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:52,236
One day, a beautiful,
young cowherderess walked by the house.

863
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,299
Cowherderess?

864
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:54,538
Hey, we could just go in, you know?

865
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:56,020
Cowherderess is walking by.

866
00:33:56,127 --> 00:34:00,673
And suddenly she felt the unbearable
need for a strand of pearls

867
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,784
and a snifter of 100-year-old scotch.

868
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:06,533
So, abandoning her cows,
she climbed over the high walls

869
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:10,651
and dropped onto the just-redone
tiled walkway

870
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:13,515
and rushed toward the enchanted french doors

871
00:34:13,627 --> 00:34:15,491
that the queen had never been happy with

872
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,574
because the hardware was
not what she had picked,

873
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:20,935
and she refused to pay that idiot designer
that she hired off of a recommendation, and--

874
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:23,206
Okay, seriously,
this didn't work when you were 4.

875
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:25,701
I am not sure why you thought
it would do any good now.

876
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,519
It's gonna be fine.

877
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:29,820
I know.

878
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:34,477
Come on, my little cowherderess.

879
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:37,710
Do you want to press the bell, or should I?

880
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,455
Hi.

881
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:47,804
Hello. Come in.

882
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:48,656
Oh, thank you.

883
00:34:48,748 --> 00:34:49,679
See? We've been invited in.

884
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:51,579
Such a great start, don't you think?

885
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,251
May I take your coats?

886
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,475
Oh, yes, thank you.

887
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:58,194
Mr. Gilmore is in the living room.

888
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:00,834
Hi.

889
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:03,688
Hey, dad.

890
00:35:03,806 --> 00:35:04,518
Hi, grandpa.

891
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:05,821
Hello, Lorelai.

892
00:35:05,945 --> 00:35:07,025
Rory, how nice to see you.

893
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:07,964
Yeah, you too.

894
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:08,984
Would you like a drink?

895
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:10,575
Yeah, that would be great.

896
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:15,651
I can get it.

897
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:18,259
Just wanted to finish the sentence.

898
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:19,469
Excellent book--

899
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:21,046
shame to put it down.

900
00:35:21,475 --> 00:35:23,491
I hope martinis will be fine.

901
00:35:23,595 --> 00:35:24,884
Ooh, better than fine.

902
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,286
Will Rory be having a martini?

903
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:27,028
Yes, she will.

904
00:35:27,152 --> 00:35:27,956
A really small one.

905
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:30,357
Oh, something smells really good,
doesn't it, Rory?

906
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:32,253
It does. It smells really good.

907
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:33,933
Oh. You're here.

908
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:35,255
Oh, mom.

909
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:36,466
Where'd you come from?

910
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,441
Hi, grandma.

911
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:38,384
Hello, Rory.

912
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:39,892
Are you getting them a drink, Richard?

913
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:40,890
Yes, I am, Emily.

914
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:42,976
Something smells really good, mom.

915
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:44,103
Oh, good.

916
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:47,478
Well, enjoy your drinks. They're doing a
showing for my art class at the DAR,

917
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,921
and I'm doing a moonscape.
I'm just finishing it up out on the patio.

918
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:52,389
You're painting?

919
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:53,553
I am.

920
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:55,203
Right now?

921
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:57,797
Well, you never know when inspiration's
going to hit.

922
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,453
You know, I'm actually getting pretty good.
I think I have a shot at a medal.

923
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:01,597
Excuse me.

924
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:03,017
Two martinis.

925
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,177
Oh, thank you, dad.

926
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:05,746
Boy, that's a serious martini.

927
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,797
Drink what you like. Leave the rest.

928
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:08,842
So, what's new?

929
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:11,531
Oh, um, well, not too much.

930
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,171
Um, things at the inn are going well.

931
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:17,025
Business-- you know.
We're booked up through--

932
00:36:17,112 --> 00:36:18,631
My martini's not cold enough. How's yours?

933
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:19,446
Mine's fine.

934
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:22,063
I'm gonna get new ice.
I'll make another batch.

935
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:27,135
Grandma's outside painting moonscapes.

936
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:29,239
Well, she thinks she can get a medal.

937
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,800
I thought you said she wanted me to come.

938
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:31,454
She did.

939
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,302
Mom, she is sitting outside in the 40-degree
weather painting moonscapes

940
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,404
so she doesn't have to be inside with me.

941
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,757
That is not the reason.

942
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:42,996
Did she or did she not say she wanted
us to come over for dinner?

943
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:47,540
She did not say it,
but I know deep down she does.

944
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:48,710
But you lied to me.

945
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:51,515
New ice. I can reshake yours if you like.

946
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:55,316
Hey, dad, is something wrong?

947
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:55,998
Wrong?

948
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:59,473
Yeah. You're very picky about your ice,
and mom's outside painting.

949
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:00,940
There's nothing wrong, Lorelai.

950
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:02,233
Is mom still mad?

951
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,179
Mad at whom?

952
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:04,037
Mad at me?

953
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:07,232
Anger is a useless emotion, Rory.
It's a waste of time.

954
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:08,689
Your mother has a shot at a medal.

955
00:37:08,786 --> 00:37:10,050
That's all that's going on around here.

956
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:11,392
Okay, right.

957
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:17,155
Mom, could you come in here just for a sec?
I'd like to ask you something.

958
00:37:17,258 --> 00:37:18,301
Well...

959
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:20,230
all right.

960
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:24,073
Can you sit down for a minute?

961
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,187
Let me go change first.

962
00:37:25,396 --> 00:37:26,182
Sit down first.

963
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,642
I can't sit down in my painting clothes.

964
00:37:27,736 --> 00:37:28,861
Why? Are they painted on?

965
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,975
I'll go upstairs and shower and
change and then I'll be back.

966
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:31,677
Mom!

967
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:34,054
This ice has a funny taste to it.
I'm gonna get some more.

968
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:37,301
Now, come on, you two.
Can we please just talk about this?

969
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:38,103
Talk about what?

970
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,686
You're obviously upset about Christopher
paying for Yale. And I get it.

971
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,692
We should have told you earlier,
but let me just explain how it happened.

972
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:46,295
No. It's my responsibility. Let me explain.

973
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,188
I don't think anyone needs
to explain anything

974
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:50,453
except why I'm not being
allowed to clean myself.

975
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:53,036
He came to me, grandma,
and he asked if he could do anything--

976
00:37:53,124 --> 00:37:54,847
This really isn't necessary.

977
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:57,067
I let him pay for Yale. He's my father.

978
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:00,546
You know something I don't, mom?

979
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:03,145
How convenient that he's her father now.

980
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:06,036
Perhaps your father can reimburse
me for the five cases of scotch

981
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,716
I had to send the men in the bursar's office.

982
00:38:07,808 --> 00:38:08,794
I'm sure he'd be happy to.

983
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,924
You know what else I find amusing?

984
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,102
"Reno 911!"?

985
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:14,812
I find it very amusing that Christopher
is suddenly such a wonderful person.

986
00:38:14,907 --> 00:38:15,469
Mom!

987
00:38:15,572 --> 00:38:18,832
It seems to me that when I was
in cahoots with him, everyone
thought that I was a villain,

988
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,677
and now you're in cahoots with him,
and that's perfectly fine.

989
00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:23,724
Please don't say "cahoots" anymore.
It's disturbing.

990
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:25,476
You're being a little hypocritical,
don't you think?

991
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:27,679
No, I don't.
You were trying to break Luke and me up,

992
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,191
and I'm trying to put Rory through college.

993
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:31,688
Rory was already being put
through college by us.

994
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:32,230
That's right.

995
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,864
I didn't want you to pay for it anymore.

996
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:35,507
There-- there it is.

997
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:36,618
So you went to Christopher.

998
00:38:36,711 --> 00:38:37,543
He came to me.

999
00:38:37,637 --> 00:38:39,279
Oh, please. You just wanted to hurt us.

1000
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,035
By taking money from my father?

1001
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:42,085
Yes, exactly!

1002
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:44,515
I've had enough of this.
I'm going back out to touch up my moonscape.

1003
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:45,272
I have some work to do.

1004
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:46,639
Fine, I have to go anyhow.

1005
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:49,149
Hey! This is not gonna happen.

1006
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:50,350
You're not going back out to your moonscape,

1007
00:38:50,431 --> 00:38:52,690
you're not going back to work,
and you're not going home.

1008
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:56,438
Now, we all agreed to have Friday night
dinner, and we're here, and I smell dinner,

1009
00:38:56,538 --> 00:39:00,033
and, yes, apparently there are some issues
to be worked out, but no one--

1010
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:03,249
and I mean no one-- is leaving
here until we do!

1011
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,796
Things were out of control.

1012
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:06,418
Not the point-- simply not the--

1013
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,625
It is completely the--

1014
00:39:07,702 --> 00:39:09,891
- Rory, do not cut your grandmother off.
- Well, I'm just saying--

1015
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,911
You come running to us,
begging us to take you in

1016
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:13,603
because you can't possibly
deal with your mother.

1017
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:14,840
That's not what happened.

1018
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:18,527
We take you in. We pay to redecorate
a pool house so you can
have a place all your own.

1019
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,906
I did not ask you to do that.

1020
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:22,382
You accepted it. You did not turn it down.

1021
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,055
I didn't hear you saying, "grandma, stop."

1022
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:26,106
I didn't see you throw yourself
at the decorators

1023
00:39:26,192 --> 00:39:28,639
while they were putting up your
very expensive wallpaper!

1024
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:31,354
Then when you decided you don't like
how things are going, you leave!

1025
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:33,096
With no notice, by the way,

1026
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:35,950
and you leave two strange boys
in our house unsupervised.

1027
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:37,513
We're missing two picture frames, by the way.

1028
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:39,642
Colin and Finn did not steal your pictures!

1029
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:41,367
Do not raise your voice to your grandmother!

1030
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:44,463
I never realized how spoiled you were, Rory,
but I guess that's to be expected.

1031
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:45,964
Only children are always spoiled.

1032
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:47,914
I'm sorry I didn't leave a note.

1033
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:50,979
My, that sounds heartfelt.
Doesn't that sound heartfelt, Richard?

1034
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:53,099
I've never been more touched in all my life.

1035
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:54,552
I apologize. You don't believe it.

1036
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:56,558
I try to defend myself,
and you don't want to hear it.

1037
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,752
So, apparently,
there's nothing I can do here.

1038
00:39:58,837 --> 00:40:00,038
Oh, there's plenty you can do.

1039
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,067
What? What can I do?

1040
00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:03,919
Well, first of all,
you can admit what you've done.
You can apologize!

1041
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:06,205
I was just trying to apologize!

1042
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,586
Cut her some slack, mom!

1043
00:40:07,684 --> 00:40:09,587
Rory was going through something terrible!

1044
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,621
Life is full of terrible things, Lorelai.

1045
00:40:11,731 --> 00:40:14,038
She was emotional. When you're emotional,
you don't think clearly.

1046
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:17,717
I remember a woman who tried to buy a plane
when her granddaughter moved out.

1047
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:21,830
I tried to time-share a plane.
It is in no way even close to the same thing.

1048
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:25,531
I've never been so happy to see
a salad in my entire life.

1049
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:27,269
Ugh! I can't believe what I'm hearing!

1050
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:30,335
If we'd known the extent of the issue,
we might not have taken Rory in.

1051
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:31,439
I tried to tell you!

1052
00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:32,264
You did not!

1053
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:35,125
I came here and I told you exactly
what happened with Mitchum,

1054
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,226
and you didn't want to hear it.

1055
00:40:36,261 --> 00:40:36,981
I don't remember that!

1056
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:37,953
I don't either!

1057
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:40,122
"The Huntzbergers told her
she wasn't good enough,

1058
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:42,355
and Mitchum told her she didn't have it."

1059
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:43,483
"He what?!"

1060
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:45,563
"Yes, and now she's dropped out of Yale,

1061
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:48,472
but between the three of us,
we can knock some sense into her."

1062
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:50,918
"Of course we'll help you.
This is not happening."

1063
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:52,720
"I'll call Charlie Davenport tomorrow."

1064
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:55,485
"Thank you, guys, so much. Just thank you."

1065
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:56,497
And scene!

1066
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,289
This is really good sorbet.

1067
00:40:58,396 --> 00:41:00,740
I know. Isn't it? Theresa made it herself.

1068
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:02,108
Mango?

1069
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,437
Passion fruit.

1070
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:04,179
Delicious.

1071
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,340
It certainly is.

1072
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:08,290
What are you thinking, buying an airplane?!

1073
00:41:08,386 --> 00:41:10,771
I didn't buy it. I looked at it!

1074
00:41:10,865 --> 00:41:12,750
Well, what were you doing
looking at a plane?!

1075
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,591
I can look at a plane if I
want to look at a plane!

1076
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:22,496
So I lead her over to the good table, smiling
like we are the best friends in the world,

1077
00:41:22,595 --> 00:41:26,384
and I tell her, Shira, you don't think Rory
is good enough to be in your family?

1078
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:29,331
"She is. We are just as good as you are.

1079
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:32,723
After all,
you are nothing but a two-bit gold digger,

1080
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:36,043
and how you managed to bag Mitchum
I will never know."

1081
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:37,019
You did not.

1082
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:38,807
Oh, yes, she did.

1083
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:40,927
I told her Mitchum still plays around.

1084
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:43,184
Oh, no. Tell her exactly what you said.

1085
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:43,918
What did I say?

1086
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:45,400
About her weight going...

1087
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:47,432
Oh, yes, yes. I got it.

1088
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,083
I told her, "Mitchum still plays around,
you know. Well, of course you know.

1089
00:41:51,193 --> 00:41:54,743
That's why your weight goes up and
down 30 pounds every 3 months."

1090
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,897
Ruthless woman!

1091
00:41:57,158 --> 00:41:59,776
I bow to the foot of the master.

1092
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:03,217
I only wished I'd remembered to
call her a cocktail waitress.

1093
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:06,013
That's my mother's version of the "C" word.

1094
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:08,645
I don't want to quit the DAR.

1095
00:42:08,755 --> 00:42:09,345
Well, too late.

1096
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,631
I was accepted and certified, grandma.
You can't just kick me out.

1097
00:42:11,743 --> 00:42:12,922
I can, too.

1098
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:14,319
I know the rules backwards and forward,

1099
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:17,273
and I have done nothing to lose my
status except argue with you,

1100
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:19,252
plus I'm in contact with more
members than you are.

1101
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:20,342
That is not true.

1102
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:22,210
And I like more of the members than you do.

1103
00:42:22,315 --> 00:42:23,256
That is not true.

1104
00:42:23,353 --> 00:42:24,788
I talk to Tweenie Halpern all the time.

1105
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:26,180
What are you doing talking
to Tweenie Halpern?

1106
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:27,647
I'm friend with Tweenie Halpern.

1107
00:42:27,763 --> 00:42:29,348
I'm helping her daughter look at colleges.

1108
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:30,531
I'm gonna give her a tour of Yale.

1109
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:33,401
You have no right to talk to Tweenie
Halpern or anyone else in the DAR.

1110
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:34,701
That is my organization.

1111
00:42:34,795 --> 00:42:35,600
I'm not quitting!

1112
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:37,135
Oh, yes, you are!

1113
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,571
So, how's Luke?

1114
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:42,010
He has a kid.

1115
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:45,440
We were 16! We didn't want to get married!

1116
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:47,392
When you get pregnant, you get married!

1117
00:42:47,486 --> 00:42:49,600
A child needs a mother and a father!

1118
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,684
Oh, my god!

1119
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:08,481
Well... I think we've officially
reinstated Friday night dinner.
