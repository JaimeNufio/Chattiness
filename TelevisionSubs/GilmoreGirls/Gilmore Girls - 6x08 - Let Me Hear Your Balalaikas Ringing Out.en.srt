1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,772
Your impatience is very distracting.

2
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:13,830
I said nothing.

3
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:14,692
I'm getting a vibe.

4
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,319
I can't control my vibe.

5
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:18,181
- Maybe I should do this alone.
- No.

6
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,634
But I need to collect my thoughts.

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,756
The last time I left you alone
with your thoughts,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,464
I came back and you were in the reds again.

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,030
So?

10
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,337
We've ruled out red.

11
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:26,881
- Why did we rule out red?
- Because you don't like red.

12
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,691
Right. And when I'm right, I'm right.
Red would be way too much in here.

13
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,323
Now, just give me a minute to concentrate.
Cone of silence, please.

14
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:33,513
You got it.

15
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:36,375
Hey, what are all your shoes doing down here?

16
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:37,305
You broke the cone.

17
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:38,453
Yeah. They're gonna get ruined.

18
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:39,823
Oh, well, talk to Paul Anka.

19
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,373
He's one by one marched every pair of my
shoes downstairs, and I have no idea why.

20
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:46,328
Lined them up perfectly,
too-- left, right, left, right.

21
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:48,048
He's very anal when he misbehaves.

22
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,390
Yeah. I'll clear them out.

23
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:51,566
No, no, no. Don't.
I want him to march them back up himself.

24
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,787
How else will he learn?

25
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:54,648
Fine. Whatever.

26
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:56,227
Weirdo.

27
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:58,538
Why did I say I don't like red?

28
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:01,284
I think your exact words were,
"better dead than red."

29
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:02,428
'Cause I'm liking red now.

30
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:03,643
What happened to the white you picked?

31
00:01:03,657 --> 00:01:05,829
That was such a nice white,
and you were so sure about it.

32
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:07,116
It didn't go with Paul Anka.

33
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:08,345
Unbelievable.

34
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:09,251
Look.

35
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:12,008
Oh, yeah. You're right.

36
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,814
That does not work, not at all.

37
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,507
See?

38
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,175
I was kidding.

39
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:18,049
Your kidding is really slowing down
the process here, big-time.

40
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,346
Hey, uh, what about a... blue?

41
00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:23,913
We're painting the outside blue.

42
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:24,991
Or maybe a yellow.

43
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:28,855
Oh, come on now.
Yellow really doesn't go with Paul Anka.

44
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:30,766
If nothing goes with him,
we may have to move.

45
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:32,257
Do you want to know the problem here?

46
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,670
Actually, no. I don't like problems.

47
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:36,254
I avoid them when I can, and I don't
like people pointing them out to me.

48
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:39,379
The guys are almost done prepping the walls,
and then they're gonna want to paint.

49
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:42,007
If we don't have a color for them,
they're gonna have nothing to do,

50
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:44,549
and then they're gonna bolt,
and we won't see them again for weeks.

51
00:01:44,624 --> 00:01:45,549
That is so cold.

52
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:48,278
They go where the money is.
If they're not painting, they're not earning.

53
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:49,157
Oh, wait.

54
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:51,827
Paul Anka-- maybe he has
an opinion on all this.

55
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,319
Oh, I'm sure he does.

56
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:54,332
Okay, dude.

57
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:55,522
Check them out.

58
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:56,997
Don't overthink it.

59
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:58,328
What looks good to you?

60
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,535
Ooh! He licked the dark magenta.

61
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,382
You know dogs are color-blind.

62
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:07,771
Okay, technicality.
What about the baseboards?

63
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:08,764
Baseboards.

64
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:10,231
Ooh!

65
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:13,588
Dark magenta baseboards. Interesting choice.

66
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,020
I need a beer.

67
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:17,261
Oh. Oh, get one for me, too, please.

68
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:18,516
How about the ceiling?

69
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,765
Dark magenta!

70
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,875
You've got the queer eye, my friend.

71
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,374
Rise and shine!

72
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:24,965
No, no, no, no, no.

73
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,606
It's a beautiful morning.

74
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:28,386
No rising. No shining.

75
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:29,983
Don't let it go to waste.

76
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,119
I'll be back in five if I don't see you.

77
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:34,381
No, no more "back in five"!

78
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:39,357
It's perfect-- a light, slightly
washed-out green like you see
in renaissance wall paintings,

79
00:03:39,454 --> 00:03:44,368
with the baseboards painted an
aquamarine blue, but dulled so
it's got a little Latin touch.

80
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:48,648
And you paint the ceilings off-white with a
hint of yellow to go great with the floors

81
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:51,199
and just give the whole space a nice glow.
What do you think?

82
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:52,581
We're not painting my apartment.

83
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:53,606
Why not?

84
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:57,246
Because we're painting your house.
That's why you have the color samples.

85
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,535
And there's not enough paint to paint
your place and the other place?

86
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:01,176
There's not enough time.

87
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:04,264
As you work on the perfect colors
for my house and Babette's house

88
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:06,615
and Mr. Lanahan's house and Sookie's house...

89
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:09,238
Oh, I showed Sookie that blanched almond.
She flipped.

90
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:11,586
...And the post office and the Church
and the odd fellows hall,

91
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,914
the painters are getting closer and closer
to being ready to paint your house.

92
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,938
- You gotta focus or...
- Or what?

93
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:19,169
- I'm gonna take that away.
- Oh, no!

94
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:21,067
You would not take my paint-sample
thingy away from me.

95
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,382
I most certainly would.

96
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,503
Well, that would seriously
slow down the process.

97
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,073
And I don't know if you know this,
but if the painters have nothing to do,

98
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:28,775
they'll move on to another job.

99
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,406
It's "the twilight zone."

100
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:32,200
I do not know what to do here.

101
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,731
Hey. I think the lullaby leader
is looking for you.

102
00:04:34,814 --> 00:04:35,931
Oh. Yeah?

103
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,291
Mr. Danes, I'm Megan, and this is Tilly.

104
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:38,973
Hi.

105
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:42,027
Um, we go to Stars Hollow middle school.
You went there.

106
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,262
I think they're looking for confirmation.

107
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:45,232
Yeah, I went.

108
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,218
He's busy, girls. Don't keep him long.

109
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,651
Well, we're on a soccer team,
and we lost our sponsor.

110
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:51,171
Aw, who was your sponsor?

111
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:52,463
Luger's Bait and Tackle.

112
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:54,003
Oh, that's right. They're shutting down.

113
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:56,684
Luger's wife caught him at that
motel with the transv...

114
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,860
...sistor radio, and, uh,
he retired honorably.

115
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:03,019
So, what are you here for?

116
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,278
We were wondering if you
would sponsor our team.

117
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:07,388
Well, I don't know.

118
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:08,972
You just have to buy our jerseys.

119
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,511
It'll say "Luke's Diner" on the back.

120
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:11,887
Plus our name-- the Bobcats.

121
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,810
And you pitch in for trophies if we win.

122
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:16,491
But you don't even have to go to
the games if you don't want.

123
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:17,812
Yeah. You don't have to come.

124
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:20,886
Girls, no offense, but I don't think so.

125
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,377
It's not my thing.

126
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,107
No problem.

127
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,450
Thank him for his time, girls.

128
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,134
Thank you.

129
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:26,339
Thank you, Mr. Danes.

130
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,204
You're welcome.

131
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,355
Bye.

132
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:32,618
Wow, Oliver Twist just kindly asked
for a little more gruel,

133
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:34,074
and you kicked him right in the junk.

134
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:34,677
Who?

135
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,569
You broke those darling little girls' hearts.

136
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:38,070
They'll find someone else.

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,411
How is this not your thing?

138
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,149
I don't want to coach a soccer team.

139
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,966
They don't need a coach.
How closely were you listening?

140
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:46,347
Well, not that closely. Kids usually talk,
but they don't say anything.

141
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:49,760
They just kind of yammer,
so if you don't find them cute,
they're just boring.

142
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,735
You should really have your
own children's show,

143
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,564
you know, as an alternative to the nice ones.

144
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,498
You know what I mean.

145
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:57,189
It's just a sponsorship,
and they're from your alma mater,

146
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:00,189
which, by the way,
is looking drap and could use a touch-up.

147
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:01,400
I'd recommend the light salmon.

148
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:02,709
Doesn't that mean something?

149
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,017
I guess a little.

150
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:05,573
You don't even have to go to the games,

151
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:08,341
and you'd get to have your name
on the back of the jerseys.

152
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,508
Free advertising-- how cool is that?

153
00:06:10,593 --> 00:06:13,288
Well, yeah, that might be all right.

154
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:18,981
Hey, and you'll get that photo that sponsors
get of the whole team sitting on the field,

155
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:21,513
and you can display it like
Al's pancake world does.

156
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:25,124
Ooh, Al-- that sea-green
with burnt-sienna trim.

157
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:26,042
I warned you.

158
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,294
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Come on.
Give it back, please.

159
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:29,855
I'm jonesing. I need my colors.

160
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:30,825
Please.

161
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,141
Think they're any good?

162
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:36,861
I don't know if that matters.

163
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:44,495
Hey, uh, if you still want a sponsor,
we can give it a shot.

164
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:45,288
Really?!

165
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:46,026
Yay!

166
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:48,097
Oh, that's wonderful, Luke. Thank you.

167
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:50,542
I guess this is you being grateful.

168
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,401
For the jerseys.

169
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:55,426
You really get, like,
no notice on these things, do you?

170
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,921
None. It's a "grab your bag and meet me
at the tarmac, son, over and out,"

171
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,601
and it's always at an ungodly hour.

172
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:01,587
6:00 a.m?

173
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,282
That's my bedtime, for god's sake.

174
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:04,510
Where's he dragging you this time?

175
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,687
A paper in Omaha.
What state is that in again?

176
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:07,592
Nebraska.

177
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,771
Ah, corn, farm animals, football.

178
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:12,065
Oh, and they love condescension
in Nebraska, too,

179
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:14,403
so hit them with that as
soon as you disembark.

180
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,819
Well, you have got to be free tonight,
my dear,

181
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:18,592
'cause I'm getting the group
together for a blowout.

182
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:19,528
Do not tell me you're working.

183
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:21,568
I can make some time for you.

184
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:22,776
Oops.

185
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,130
Evasive maneuver.

186
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,026
What?

187
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:26,121
My grandmother.

188
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:27,655
Is she coming at you with
a knife or something?

189
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,270
It's one thing to be forced
to move into the big house,

190
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:33,438
but now the big house is feeling tom thumb
tiny. My grandmother's everywhere.

191
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:35,966
The older generation-- they have
their methods of ubiquity.

192
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm positive that there are at least
five of her wandering the
property like she's a cylon.

193
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,563
So, can you meet me out here tonight?

194
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,501
Why are you whispering?

195
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:44,725
Because you're whispering.

196
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:45,634
That's cute.

197
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:47,103
I'll see you at your place? 8:00?

198
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:47,773
Perfect.

199
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:48,667
See you then.

200
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:50,728
Rory!

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,348
Oh, hi, grandma.

202
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,973
I was just heading out, in kind of a hurry.

203
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,604
Heading out where?

204
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,457
Errands. Just errands.

205
00:07:58,557 --> 00:08:00,613
You know, Shandinka would be willing
to do your errands for you--

206
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,423
she has a used SUV.

207
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:03,948
I can do them myself.

208
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:05,809
Is something wrong with your face?

209
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:06,609
No.

210
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:07,872
Why are you hiding it?

211
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:10,935
It looks fine.

212
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,413
It is fine.

213
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:15,335
So, are you staying overnight
at Paris' again this week?

214
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:15,996
Maybe.

215
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:18,871
That's so fun-- having a girl
friend for sleepovers.

216
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:21,539
You know, Paris can sleep over
here sometime if you want.

217
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:22,856
Great. Thanks.

218
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:25,684
Your grandfather's out of town for
a few days, so it's just us girls.

219
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:27,072
Got a preference for dinner tonight?

220
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:29,183
I may not make it for dinner
tonight, grandma.

221
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,420
Oh. I was looking forward to it.

222
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:32,485
Sorry.

223
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:35,601
It's always good to give 24-hours
notice on these things.

224
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,504
Again, sorry.

225
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:40,015
You're looking skinnier,
and you're skipping dinner.

226
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,933
I'm not skipping dinner.
I'm having dinner out.

227
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,238
You're not bulimic?

228
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:46,356
I really have to go, grandma.

229
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:49,658
One last thing-- the Russian tea for
the DAR-- that's going well?

230
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:53,431
Yeah. It's like clockwork. It's an easy one.
Teas are easy.

231
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,962
Oh! That reminds me.

232
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:58,943
I really have to go,
grandma-- she said for the umpteenth time.

233
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,970
What do you think?

234
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,720
It's nice. Whose is it?

235
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,180
It's for you, for the Russian tea.
Want to try it on?

236
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:08,000
Later. Please.

237
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:09,350
I really, really have to go.

238
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:11,072
Well, that's something to look forward to.

239
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:12,128
Definitely.

240
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:12,797
See you later.

241
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:13,765
See you later.

242
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,503
Oh, this is hard. This is so hard.

243
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:28,566
I know.

244
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:30,131
I can be so indecisive.

245
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:33,288
Put me in front of a bin of cantaloupe,
it'll take me an hour to pick one-- an hour!

246
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,262
And this is harder than cantaloupe.

247
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,816
Come on. Focus, Babette.

248
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:38,867
A green, an off-white-- what do you think?

249
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,233
They all seem fine.

250
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:44,837
See, I don't know if you're aware of this,
but if painters are ready to paint,

251
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,369
and you don't have your colors ready,
they'll leave,
and you'll never see them again,

252
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,717
so the clock is ticking here.

253
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,184
Don't let her bully you, Babette.

254
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,643
But I gotta pick a color!

255
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,640
Lorelai's gotta pick a color!

256
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:57,088
Just leave us alone out here!
Go about your business!

257
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:59,909
You're being cruel to Babette,
and you're going to rot in hell for this.

258
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:01,371
I'm just getter her opinion.

259
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:03,578
I've caused an argument. I'm horrible.

260
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:05,907
You've got till close of day tomorrow,
and that's it.

261
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:07,490
Good! That'll give me enough time!

262
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:09,578
Not you, Babette-- Lorelai!

263
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:10,863
He's mad at me.

264
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:12,069
He's not mad at you.

265
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,740
He's right. It's my thing. I should do it.

266
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,864
Thank god.

267
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:18,243
Well, here's the information
you wanted for Paul Anka.

268
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,151
You got your training schools.
Training's always good for them.

269
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:23,081
Yeah, uh, I took him to a few sessions.

270
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,191
He fell in love with a poodle
and got very distracted.

271
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:28,601
And doggy day care-- let him
run around with other dogs.

272
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,859
Good for socializing him.

273
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,527
Well, the other dogs we've come across
on walks-- he'll bark at them,

274
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:34,502
and then when they look at him,
he'll play dead.

275
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:35,762
It's kind of sad.

276
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:39,873
Well, he's the cutest basket case
I've ever seen. That's for sure.

277
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:41,009
Gotta go.

278
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:43,604
Okay. Thanks for coming, Babette.
This will help.

279
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:48,205
So... hey, if you were gonna pick between
the papaya whip I showed you

280
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,484
- and the medium spring green...
- Stop it!

281
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:53,186
- God, he's got good ears.
- See you, doll. Good luck!

282
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:55,021
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye!

283
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:58,319
Yeah, I want the two-color team
name on the front in script

284
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:02,536
and the "Luke's Diner" in a vertical
arch above the number on the back.

285
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,368
- "L" for Lorelai.
- "L" for Luke's.

286
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:05,813
Hey, our names have the same first letter.

287
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,241
- You like the style?
- Classy.

288
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:11,260
But I want really nice stitching,
even if it costs extra.

289
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:14,223
I don't care that it's double. Just do it.
I want my girls to look good.

290
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:15,736
Listen to daddy warbucks.

291
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:19,174
Yeah.
12 for the team plus three spares will do it.
15 in all.

292
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,806
Uh, plus another medium-- 16,

293
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:26,627
and an extra-large men's, so 17.

294
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:31,372
And one for a medium dog.

295
00:11:31,446 --> 00:11:33,452
Yeah. Dog.

296
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:36,718
And this is a rush order.
I want them for the next game.

297
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:38,637
Okay, thanks, Ollie. Bye.

298
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,482
Those girls are gonna be styling.

299
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:43,164
Yeah, well, they're gonna have the
best uniforms in the league.

300
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,834
I've seen pictures of the other
teams-- little bag ladies.

301
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:47,317
Look how you've embraced this.

302
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:49,545
Well, the more I thought about it,
the more fun it seemed.

303
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,492
And my friend Ed told me the team
is actually pretty good. They
got a chance to go all the way.

304
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,537
Cool. Wow.
They could make a movie about this someday.

305
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:59,687
You know-- the reluctant,
handsome diner owner sponsoring a team

306
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:02,972
that goes all the way to the national finals,
and you know who would play you?

307
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:04,421
- Who?
- Tobey Maguire!

308
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:05,745
He's way younger than me.

309
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,454
But his career is hot. Go with Tobey.

310
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:09,321
What about that Vito Morgenstern?

311
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:10,990
Sure. Or Viggo Mortensen.

312
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:12,967
Or Donald Sutherland.

313
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:13,791
Too old.

314
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:14,818
We'll dye his hair.

315
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,031
He's got jowls.

316
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:17,308
You're picky.

317
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:19,363
What's he doing?

318
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,591
I don't know.
He's been doing that a lot lately.

319
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:23,533
Hey, hey, buddy,
there's nothing for you there.

320
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:26,239
He need Geritol? He's been lethargic lately.

321
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:27,970
He's depressed or something.

322
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:29,052
Who are you calling?

323
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:31,264
Just saw something in this thing.

324
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:33,284
Hey, Ollie, it's Luke Danes again.

325
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,485
Listen, I was looking through
your brochure again.

326
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,509
You can make caps, too, right?

327
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:38,669
Soccer players wear caps?

328
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,260
No, I just think they'll look cute in them.

329
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:42,950
Yeah, what's your highest quality
cap you got there?

330
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:45,543
Yeah, I don't want plastic in the sizing.
It's cheapo.

331
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:51,398
You got that kind that you kind of pull
on the cloth thingy to size it, right?

332
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:53,746
Great. Well, give me 20 of those.

333
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,508
- Met her.
- Cool. A girl-on-girl thing.

334
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:13,364
- It's a snuff film.
- A lesbian snuff film.

335
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:16,918
A redundant lesbian snuff film.

336
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:20,745
How INXS missed her, I don't know.

337
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:22,137
Raise a glass to INXS.

338
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,611
My countrymen, I'm less than proud to say.

339
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:29,431
I cannot, cannot believe they've reinstated
folk night at my beloved pub.

340
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,487
It's a travesty!

341
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:33,613
Is there any alcohol left in the state
of Connecticut that's not inside them?

342
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:34,527
I doubt it.

343
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:36,332
So, boys, another round?

344
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:38,327
Posthaste. Barkeep!

345
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:40,004
You've hardly touched the
drink in front of you.

346
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:41,721
Ah, but I'm anticipating.

347
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:44,975
You don't wait till the drink's done to
order another. That's for amateurs.

348
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,847
Right. I forgot you went pro.

349
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:50,637
So, boys, boys, when is the life and
death brigade going out again?

350
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:51,630
We have been remiss.

351
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:52,910
I have ideas--

352
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:55,895
big ideas, potentially harmful ideas.

353
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:57,284
Hey, you mind?

354
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,075
Boyfriend?

355
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:58,859
Brother.

356
00:13:58,934 --> 00:13:59,898
Or both. He could be southern.

357
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:01,802
Hey. New drinking game--

358
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,488
every time the folk singer sounds sincere,
we have to take a drink.

359
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:07,544
Buckle up. It's gonna be a long night.

360
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,207
Come on. Start folding your own, gents.

361
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:12,609
Whoever hits the folk singer first wins.

362
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:24,189
Good morning, new haven!

363
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:28,635
My, my, you look fresh and appealing tonight!

364
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,114
Shut up!

365
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,625
God has spoken to me...

366
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:32,810
rather rudely.

367
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:33,902
Shut up!

368
00:14:33,993 --> 00:14:35,239
Finn, keep it down.

369
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:37,313
Finn, watch.

370
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:40,383
Tostingo!

371
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:44,460
Why are we leaving, ace?

372
00:14:44,538 --> 00:14:45,754
Because they're closing.

373
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,013
That's no excuse.

374
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:48,743
We've overstayed our welcome.

375
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:50,171
That makes me sad.

376
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,549
You've gotta get your plane in the morning.

377
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:52,787
- Have I gained weight?
- Why?

378
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,361
Finn didn't make a pass at me.

379
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:57,985
No, love, my brain is cloudy.
Here I am making a pass at you.

380
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,203
Pass, pass!

381
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:01,526
That is so expositional.

382
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:03,019
Guys, just get in the car.

383
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:06,264
I've forgotten how to get into a car.

384
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:08,682
Me too. Rory, did you have your
owner's manual with you, love?

385
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,124
Oh, my god. Just get in!

386
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:12,493
- Bon voyage.
- Good luck with your ringling.

387
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:13,430
One more drink.

388
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:15,335
Oh, we've got a runner!

389
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,589
- Come on!
- Logan!

390
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,556
Hey, come on. Let me in.

391
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:22,160
Oh, Logan, they're closed.

392
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:24,178
I have to apologize to that folk singer.

393
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:26,417
She's not here. Everyone's gone.

394
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:27,882
I hurt her feelings.

395
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:30,500
She's a folk singer. She's used to it.
Come on.

396
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:32,795
I don't want to go to Omaha tomorrow.

397
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,595
I know.

398
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,283
- It's boring.
- I know.

399
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:36,705
And it's not here.

400
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:39,259
Come on. Yeah.

401
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,040
I don't like steaks or insurance or football
or anything else that they have there.

402
00:15:43,115 --> 00:15:44,312
You like steaks.

403
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:46,103
Do they even have electricity there?

404
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:48,548
Yeah. Yeah. They just got it last year.

405
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:49,786
Don't make me go.

406
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:52,852
I'm not making you go.
I'm just trying to get you home.

407
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,497
But getting me home means that I have
to go to sleep, and when I wake up,

408
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,869
I have to go on a plane to Omaha.
Where's Omaha?

409
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:00,773
Where's Omaha?

410
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,296
Just get in, please.

411
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,228
Colin?

412
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:13,598
Finn?

413
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:15,090
Shut up!

414
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:16,408
Guys!

415
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:18,032
Shut up!

416
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:34,930
Jess.

417
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:36,960
Hey.

418
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:39,750
Hey.

419
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,633
I...

420
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,563
Sorry. That wasn't a sentence.

421
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,149
I got the gist.

422
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:51,389
What are you doing here?

423
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,023
I got a job-- professional driveway stalker.

424
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:54,723
Pays good?

425
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:55,951
Yeah, but the hours suck.

426
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:56,789
Jess...

427
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:58,698
I'm in town on a little business--

428
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,249
all nice and aboveboard.

429
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:01,318
How'd you know where to find me?

430
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:02,300
Luke.

431
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:04,612
I shook it out of him.
He wasn't sure if it was okay.

432
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:05,709
It's okay.

433
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,886
You look good.

434
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:08,588
The years don't seem to have hardened you.

435
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,182
Yeah, you look good, too.

436
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,730
I know this is kind of weird, but there's
actually something I wanted to tell you--

437
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,478
Show you, actually.

438
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:17,189
I can come back another time.

439
00:17:17,263 --> 00:17:20,706
No, it's just, uh,
we're kind of exposed here.

440
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:23,072
My-- her window's, like, right there.

441
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:23,735
Whose?

442
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:25,030
Uh, my grandma's.

443
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:25,977
You want to come in?

444
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:26,879
You sure?

445
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,437
Yeah. Come on.

446
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:31,716
But just be careful.
She's a very light sleeper.

447
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,571
So, here we are.

448
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:38,308
Casa Rory.

449
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:43,550
So our voices don't carry.

450
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,356
Very prudent.

451
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:47,124
This is not really my taste.

452
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:49,435
Yeah, not unless you've aged about 90 years.

453
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,276
I haven't.

454
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,472
Is that for Halloween?

455
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:55,921
No, no.
This is just for a function I have to go to.

456
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:56,922
Function?

457
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:59,368
It's just a job-- the DAR--

458
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:02,536
Daughters of the American Revolution.
It's not a career or anything.

459
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:04,395
- I hope not.
- No.

460
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:06,472
See, don't get the wrong idea.

461
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:08,671
I'm just here temporarily.

462
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:10,994
- My mom and I--
- Luke alluded to something.

463
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,552
It's a long story.
I was crashing in the pool house,

464
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:17,958
and that was just temporary,
but the pool house became storage,

465
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,328
so then I had to move into the main house.

466
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,920
All temporary.

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,319
Isn't school in session?

468
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:25,050
Why aren't you living on campus?

469
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:26,838
Because I'm not going.

470
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,491
You graduate already, Doogie?

471
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:31,177
No. I'm just taking a little time off.

472
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:32,605
Time off.

473
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,583
So, where are you living, Jess?
I want to know about you-- mystery man.

474
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:39,831
I'm in Philly.

475
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,073
- Really?
- Don't laugh.

476
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,144
No, I'm not. Philadelphia's gotten cool.

477
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:44,763
And New York's gotten expensive.

478
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,134
Anyway, it's a pretty cool
scene in Philly now--

479
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,740
lot of younger people there...

480
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:49,877
pretty big art scene.

481
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,852
I know. I read that in the New York Times.

482
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,385
They had a picture of a bunch of young people
standing on a roof, kind of eclectic and all.

483
00:18:56,471 --> 00:19:00,166
It looked fun. I mean, it was clearly one
of those pictures that wasn't candid.

484
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,163
It was looking a little stiff,

485
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:04,807
but they looked happy.

486
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:05,961
Are you nervous?

487
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,369
A little.

488
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:08,932
It's been a long time.

489
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:10,320
I'm a little nervous, too.

490
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:11,392
Good. I'm not alone.

491
00:19:11,504 --> 00:19:13,434
So, I didn't just come here to chat.

492
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,081
I wanted to show you something.

493
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:16,626
Right. You said that.

494
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:21,058
And I didn't think you'd believe it if
I didn't show it to you in person.

495
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:22,962
Well, color me curious.

496
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:24,224
A book.

497
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:26,584
"The subsect...

498
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:29,757
written by Jess Mariano."

499
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:30,729
It's no misprint.

500
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:31,698
You wrote a book?

501
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:32,539
A short novel.

502
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,692
You wrote a book?!

503
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:36,607
Through a fluke, I got it to these
guys that have a small press,

504
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:41,503
and they read it.
I don't know if they were high or something,
but they decide to publish it.

505
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,415
- You wrote a book.
- There's no money in it.

506
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:46,432
They only printed like 500 of them.

507
00:19:46,524 --> 00:19:48,250
Believe me, I'm not quitting my day job.

508
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:50,156
But you wrote it. You wrote a book.

509
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:51,345
Yeah, I know. It's hard to believe.

510
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:53,195
You sat down and wrote a novel.

511
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:54,873
Author-distributed, too.

512
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:56,157
That's what I'm doing here.

513
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,530
I'm going around begging independent
bookstores to put it
in stock. Got it in a few.

514
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,648
- Cool! Where?
- Around.

515
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,168
I want to see it in the store.

516
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,346
I can give you the addresses.

517
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:06,919
You know what I'm gonna do when
I see it in the store?

518
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:07,519
What?

519
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:10,696
You know that section toward the front-- the
staff recommendations?

520
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:13,376
I'm gonna grab a copy of your book
and put it in that section,

521
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,979
and then I'm going to write my own
little recommendation on a card

522
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:17,949
and attach it so people see it and buy it.

523
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:20,891
Read it first. That way you can
discourage people from buying it.

524
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:22,654
No way! I know it's good.

525
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,276
Jess, you've got such a great brain.

526
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:26,886
I knew that if you could just sit
down and stop shaking it around,

527
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:29,324
you could do something like this. I knew it.
I knew it.

528
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,775
I know you did. I work at that press now.

529
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:34,917
Five smelly guys in a cramped room
on locust street putting out

530
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:36,668
about three books a month-- but it's fun.

531
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,393
What a about a sequel?
Are you writing a sequel?

532
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:41,038
You should read it before you get
too jazzed about it. Okay?

533
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:41,996
Shh!

534
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:44,847
Sorry.

535
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,329
I thought I heard footsteps.
I think we're okay.

536
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:48,724
It's kind of late. I should go.

537
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:49,988
It is kind of late.

538
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:54,206
So, I just basically wanted to show you that.

539
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:58,860
Uh, tell you... tell you that I couldn't
have done it without you.

540
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:01,262
Thanks.

541
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:04,841
I'm gonna be around for a couple days.
Can we talk again?

542
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,867
Preferably above a whisper.

543
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:08,892
Yeah. I'd like that.
How about tomorrow night?

544
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:09,925
8:00 okay?

545
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:10,878
Yep.

546
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:11,997
Good.

547
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,918
I'll sneak out on my own.

548
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,918
Cool.

549
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:22,130
Oh, hey-- the book.

550
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:23,208
Oh, it's yours.

551
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:36,735
So, where are the bleachers?

552
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,459
Oh, they don't have bleachers
at soccer games.

553
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:39,928
They just stand on the sidelines.

554
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,298
Where do we go if we feel like making
out in the middle of the game?

555
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,796
I don't think they'd mind if we did
it right here in front of them.

556
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:47,226
Cool. Got a nice crowd here, Mr. Sponsor.

557
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,003
Not bad. Not bad.

558
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,510
So, these are soccer moms, huh?

559
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:52,487
They're just really bored spinsters.

560
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:56,407
They seem very concerned with education
and national security.

561
00:21:56,604 --> 00:21:57,622
Luke!

562
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:58,790
Hi! You came!

563
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,323
Oh, yeah. I thought I'd come down,
see the girls in action.

564
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,751
Oh, they give it their all. You'll be proud.

565
00:22:03,826 --> 00:22:04,749
I'm sure I will.

566
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:07,610
Look at those girls.
Look how cute they are in those uniforms.

567
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:10,962
Check out the other team's-- cheap fabric,
cheap stitching.

568
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:12,472
Look at the sponsor-- Fred's dry cleaning--

569
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:14,493
ruined a favorite sweater years ago.
Today he pays.

570
00:22:15,394 --> 00:22:17,007
Luke! You came!

571
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:18,324
Hey, girls. You ready to play?

572
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:19,252
We hope so.

573
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:21,567
The other team-- I think you're
gonna wipe the floor with them.

574
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:23,721
- I think we've got a shot.
- No, I know you've got a shot.

575
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,793
Don't forget-- we're having a little
celebration at the diner
afterwards, win or lose.

576
00:22:26,864 --> 00:22:27,635
Cool.

577
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,514
We better get back.

578
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,399
Have a good game.

579
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:30,138
See ya!

580
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:31,385
Bend it like Beckham!

581
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:34,162
Oh, so,
I dropped Paul Anka off at doggy day care.

582
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,084
It was a little scary.

583
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:36,016
No, that'll be good for him.

584
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:37,110
He seemed okay.

585
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:40,593
He was a little standoffish at first,
but then he got very friendly
with the cash register.

586
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:43,021
And then a dog ran up to him,
and he played dead for a couple seconds,

587
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:45,412
and when that didn't work,
he ran off playing with the other dogs.

588
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:46,614
I think it's gonna do him some good.

589
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,670
I think so, too.

590
00:22:47,758 --> 00:22:49,266
Oh, here we go.

591
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,068
Oh, who got the ball?

592
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:55,878
Well, the Bobcats lost the toss,
so the other team got the ball.

593
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:56,853
So, we've lost already?

594
00:22:56,935 --> 00:22:58,433
Just the toss-- it means nothing.

595
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:01,139
How many points are we behind 'cause
we screwed up the toss?

596
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:02,629
Nothing, it just started. 0-0.

597
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:04,445
Were we talking during the toss?
How did we miss the toss?

598
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:06,108
- Just watch the game.
- Okay.

599
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:06,998
Look at that Megan run.

600
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:09,179
Ooh, she's making her move.

601
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,060
She's fast.

602
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,452
See her coming up behind that girl?

603
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:14,152
She's gonna try to steal and
then move the ball forward--

604
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:16,003
- Oh!
- Oh! What was that?

605
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:18,280
Good hustle, girls! Good hustle!

606
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,595
- Is that girl unconscious?
- No, no, no.

607
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:21,832
She's getting up. She's a little wobbly.

608
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:24,915
Is it okay for Megan to slam her elbow
into that girl's neck like that?

609
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,393
I don't think-- oh, my god!

610
00:23:27,482 --> 00:23:29,561
Oh! That was poor little Tilly.

611
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:31,109
There's blood. I see blood.

612
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:32,833
Who is their coach? Sam Peckinpah?

613
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:34,964
Way to go, Tilly. Dominate. Dominate.

614
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:36,903
Shouldn't that be a foul or something?

615
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,103
Oh, don't worry. Tilly is an expert
at knowing when the ref is
watching and when he isn't.

616
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,343
Aggression! Aggression! Aggression!

617
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,677
I cannot watch this.

618
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:47,667
Ah! I heard that.
It was just as bad as seeing it.

619
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:49,713
Now I think that girl's unconscious.

620
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,505
- It was-- it was--
- Violent.

621
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,776
- "Scarface" on a soccer field.
- Those little girls-- Megan, Tilly.

622
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:05,190
- Animals! Animals!
- Did you see the blood on their jerseys?

623
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:08,229
Oh, I did see that. The refs look like
they're afraid to call penalties.

624
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,303
Can you blame them?

625
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:10,591
It's Alicia. Duck.

626
00:24:10,842 --> 00:24:13,187
Ohh... she's not coming after us.

627
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,206
Although she is walking right toward us.

628
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,895
- Oh! She turned.
- Oh, thank god.

629
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:18,259
- She turned away.
- Okay.

630
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:20,184
Oh, those sweet, little 11-year-old girls.

631
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:21,621
Killers! Killers all!

632
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,907
They won. They won that game.

633
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:25,188
Bobcats 37, humanity nothing.

634
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,386
I don't want to go to another game.

635
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:27,732
- Me neither.
- Good.

636
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,032
Seems like a good time to get away.

637
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:34,017
Yeah, they're all distracted. Gun it! Gun it!

638
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:53,093
What are you doing?

639
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,447
I didn't know if it was okay to ring or not.

640
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:56,668
She's not here.

641
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:57,639
She's not?

642
00:24:57,732 --> 00:24:58,955
She's playing bridge tonight.

643
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:00,190
Oh, good.

644
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,076
I parked on the street so she wouldn't see.

645
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:04,558
You're very good at covert ops.

646
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,377
Years of practice.
So, where do you want to go?

647
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:07,925
I don't know.
I don't know the area that well.

648
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:08,872
You live here.

649
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,826
I know, but Hartford's still a mystery.

650
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:14,215
Even when I went to Chilton,
I got right on the bus and headed home.

651
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,769
So I don't even have any old high
school hangouts to revisit.

652
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:18,717
And these days, I've just been eating here.

653
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:22,421
Well, I just prefer not going someplace
that has food in the title.

654
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:23,100
Meaning...

655
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,508
Olive, chili, soup.

656
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:26,797
No gardens. No plantations.

657
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:28,594
Got it. Something funkier.

658
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:30,921
Steer me to the college district.
I'll find us something funky.

659
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,040
Sounds good.

660
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:41,537
Logan.

661
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:42,824
Am I interrupting something?

662
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:43,855
No.

663
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:45,439
Hey. When did you get back?

664
00:25:45,535 --> 00:25:46,502
Couple hours ago.

665
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:49,021
Oh, I-- I thought you were
getting back tomorrow.

666
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,470
I thought I'd surprise you, ace.

667
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:54,219
Well, I'm glad you did 'cause you
get to meet my old friend, Jess.

668
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:57,416
This is Logan, my boyfriend.
Logan, this is Jess.

669
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:58,880
He's in from out of town.

670
00:26:03,005 --> 00:26:04,229
Wow.

671
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,245
That sounded so grown-up.

672
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,003
We're at the age now where we say things like
"in from out of town" and "old friend,"

673
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:11,553
'cause when you're young,
all your friends are new,

674
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,136
and you have to get old to have old friends.

675
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,402
How you doing?

676
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:19,987
Okay.

677
00:26:21,444 --> 00:26:23,383
We were just gonna go grab a bite to eat.

678
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,431
Great. Well, how about if we all go together.
Is that okay?

679
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:26,372
Okay by me.

680
00:26:26,472 --> 00:26:27,434
Good.

681
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,863
All right.

682
00:26:29,512 --> 00:26:30,465
Good.

683
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:34,637
We were actually at a loss for where to go,
so you actually saved us.

684
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:36,401
Call me superman. Why don't you follow us.

685
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,973
- Sure.
- Great.

686
00:26:38,094 --> 00:26:39,056
Come on.

687
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:05,084
Baby.

688
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:06,491
Ohh.

689
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,440
Look.

690
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:14,203
I'm not saying take a dive or let them win.

691
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:15,413
- Good burger.
- Thanks.

692
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:19,843
I'm not even saying let them score a goal,
which the other team did not.

693
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:22,133
- Yeah! Shut out!
- Donut!

694
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:22,987
They ate some dirt.

695
00:27:23,063 --> 00:27:24,898
They did. They did. They ate some dirt.

696
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:28,356
You fed it to them, but all I'm saying
is do you have to hit them so hard?

697
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,386
It's part of the game.

698
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,926
You have to be aggressive,
or they'll roll over you.

699
00:27:32,004 --> 00:27:35,345
You're not being competitive if your jersey
doesn't have a little "O" negative on it.

700
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:36,399
I know. Absolutely.

701
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:39,024
But, uh, for example, Megan,
that bicycle kick you did.

702
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,170
Bicycle kicks are allowed.

703
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:41,464
Not on another girl's head.

704
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:42,961
She was all up in my grill!

705
00:27:43,054 --> 00:27:45,966
I know, and I don't like it when
people are all up in my grill,

706
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:48,565
but there are other ways to deal with it.

707
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:50,158
We play the way the boys play.

708
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,182
Watch them. You'll see.

709
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:54,135
But boys are boys, and girls are girls.

710
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:58,029
I cannot believe I'm hearing this.

711
00:27:58,097 --> 00:28:01,368
So we're just supposed to play like cute
little girls like we're at some tea party?

712
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,354
I'm not saying that.

713
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:03,232
We want to win.

714
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:05,212
Which means we gotta kick some butt!

715
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,748
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

716
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:09,588
You were so shy when I met you.

717
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:13,161
I'll be right back.

718
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:21,930
Luke's.

719
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:23,293
Hey. It's me.

720
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,700
Hey, what's wrong?

721
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:27,100
It's Paul Anka. He's sick.

722
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:27,973
He's sick?

723
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:31,066
Yeah.
He doesn't want to walk or eat or anything.

724
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,900
He's never been sick in his whole life.

725
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:37,076
I mean, I haven't had him his whole life,
so it's possible he's been sick in his life.

726
00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:40,287
I'll never know for sure,
but to me it's as if it's the first time.

727
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:43,056
He got sick when he ate that chocolate.
Did he eat more chocolate?

728
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:46,107
He hasn't eaten chocolate.
He hasn't eaten anything in two days.

729
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,141
Get him to the vet.

730
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:47,992
I did.

731
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:52,670
The vet just said that he has some sort of
bug and to let him be until it passes.

732
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:54,381
I feel so helpless.

733
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:58,524
Well, I've got the team here,
so as soon as they're gone, I'll come over.

734
00:28:58,622 --> 00:29:00,910
I mean, they wolf it down like pigs,
so it's not gonna be that long

735
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:02,381
unless they want a third helping.

736
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:04,484
Maybe I should take him back to the vet.

737
00:29:04,562 --> 00:29:07,926
Just let Paul Anka be. Dogs are dogs.
They know how to heal.

738
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:10,273
Paul Anka isn't a dog.
He's some sort of hybrid.

739
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:12,422
Maybe that vet doesn't specialize in hybrids.

740
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:13,819
Sit tight. I'll be over soon.

741
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,022
Okay. Bye.

742
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:15,968
Bye.

743
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:25,605
I live pretty close.
I'd have had you over to check it out,
but it's a bit of a mess.

744
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:28,525
And you don't serve food,
so we would have been starving at your place.

745
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:30,977
I've got appetizers-- half-full bag of chips.

746
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:33,125
Just check the expiration
date before you dive in.

747
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,275
I'm good with this place.

748
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,859
Little pointer-- don't come on folk night.

749
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,567
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of folk music.

750
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,772
Something we have in common.

751
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:39,780
Great.

752
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:42,498
Where's a waitress? Yo, yo. Right here.

753
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,517
Uh, another McKellen's neat, and, Jess,
another brew?

754
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:46,479
I'm still working on this one.

755
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,374
Another one-- just in case.

756
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:50,404
Well, we should probably order.

757
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,437
It's a big menu, so if you need guidance...

758
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:53,351
I'm not hungry.

759
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:54,378
You're not hungry?

760
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:54,978
Nope.

761
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:57,104
I thought the whole point was you two
were going to get something to eat?

762
00:29:57,182 --> 00:29:58,136
And talk.

763
00:29:58,223 --> 00:30:00,742
Well, yes, it's a given that you're
gonna talk while you eat.

764
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:05,004
You know, chef de cuisine will gladly make
anything you want if nothing there appeals.

765
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:06,419
The burgers are good here.

766
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:07,474
Maybe a burger.

767
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:11,515
Get one of those fancy ones, too,
and it's on me,
so don't let the price stop you.

768
00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:12,469
I'll pay for my own.

769
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:13,834
Good man.

770
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:16,526
So, how long have you two known each other?

771
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:17,583
A while.

772
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:18,343
You date?

773
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,102
Yes. We used to date.

774
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:23,042
Ah! No hemming. No hawing.
Good course of action.

775
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:24,915
So, were you two high school sweethearts--

776
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:26,694
rock around the clock,
two straws in the milkshake?

777
00:30:26,769 --> 00:30:27,278
Logan.

778
00:30:27,362 --> 00:30:30,485
Hey, did we cheers? That's bad luck.
Let's cheers.

779
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:32,150
I think we did already, twice.

780
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:33,911
Well, let's do it again. Cheers.

781
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:35,253
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

782
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:39,597
So... what do you do, Jess?

783
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:40,715
Oh, this and that.

784
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,448
Describe the "this." Describe the "that."

785
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,209
He writes.

786
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,833
You write? Impressive. What do you write?

787
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,706
Nothing important.

788
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,608
He wrote a book.

789
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:48,689
Oh, you penned the great
American novel, Jess?

790
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:50,036
Wasn't quite that ambitious.

791
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,849
So, what are we talking here? Short novel?
Kafka length or longer?

792
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:56,862
Dos Passos, Tolstoy?
Or longer-- Robert Musil? Proust?

793
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:58,443
I'm not throwing you with these names, am I?

794
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:00,178
You seem very obsessed with length.

795
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:01,927
I'm just trying to get a picture in my head,
that's all.

796
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:03,418
It's a short novel.

797
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,301
Any good?

798
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,639
I haven't read it yet.

799
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:08,250
Yet? At least you're gonna have one reader.
That's something.

800
00:31:08,338 --> 00:31:08,932
Yeah.

801
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:12,640
You know, I should just write down all my
random thoughts and stuff that happens to me

802
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:15,644
and conversations I have and just add
a bunch of he said, she said's,

803
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,221
and get it published-- you got a copy on you?

804
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,859
No.

805
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:18,817
You should send me a copy.

806
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:21,683
And where do I send it-- the
blond dick at Yale?

807
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:22,273
Jess.

808
00:31:22,357 --> 00:31:25,097
Whoa, whoa. We're just trying to
keep it friendly here, buddy.

809
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,328
Get out of my way.

810
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:28,093
Forget him, Rory.

811
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,396
Don't follow me.

812
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,296
Jess, wait.

813
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:35,843
Jess, I'm sorry.

814
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:36,991
We shouldn't have done this.

815
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:38,678
He's just in a bad way lately.

816
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,899
He's a jerk.

817
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:43,202
He was. In there-- definitely. I'm so sorry.

818
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:45,600
I read that guy the second I saw him.
I should have begged off.

819
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:46,609
Well, I didn't want you to.

820
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:48,041
He better not come out here.

821
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:51,595
Please, Jess, he had a lot to drink.
He's tired from traveling.

822
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:53,108
This isn't him. I swear.

823
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,428
What the hell is going on?

824
00:31:54,525 --> 00:31:58,760
I told you. He's tired,
and his family's bugging him right now.

825
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:01,371
I mean with you. What's going on with you?

826
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:03,621
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

827
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:07,022
I know you better than anyone.
This isn't you.

828
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,747
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?

829
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:12,048
Living at your grandparents' place,
being in the DAR, no Yale--

830
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,710
why did you drop out of Yale?!

831
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:18,275
- It's complicated.
- It's not! It's not complicated.

832
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:19,016
You don't know.

833
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:20,179
This isn't you.

834
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,705
This-- you going out with this
jerk with the Porsche.

835
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:25,373
We made fun of guys like this.

836
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:26,829
You caught him on a bad night.

837
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:29,114
This isn't about him.

838
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,654
Okay, screw him.

839
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:32,746
What's going on with you?

840
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:37,303
This isn't you, Rory. You know it isn't.
What's going on?

841
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:42,361
I don't know.

842
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:46,817
I don't know.

843
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:52,371
Okay, uh...

844
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:58,078
May-may-maybe we'll catch
up at a better time.

845
00:33:04,623 --> 00:33:07,004
Happy birthday, by the way.

846
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,903
Wasn't that a couple weeks ago,
your birthday?

847
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,458
You're not gonna believe this.

848
00:33:31,554 --> 00:33:34,910
Over the music, the crowd, I hear one
girl's voice cutting through
it all-- the folk singer--

849
00:33:34,997 --> 00:33:37,324
she's in the corner with her boyfriend.
I sent them over a round of drinks.

850
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:39,022
What the hell? He's gone?

851
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:40,876
Yes, he's gone.

852
00:33:41,003 --> 00:33:42,998
Writers are so sensitive.

853
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,062
You were a jerk, Logan.

854
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:46,804
I was just challenging him. Jeez.

855
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:48,621
Hey, if Hemingway can take it, so can he.

856
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,138
Hey, if he wanted to,
he could have taken a pop at me.

857
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:53,454
Pugnacity-- it's a vital component
of literary life.

858
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:55,335
Again, consult your Hemingway. Come on.

859
00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:56,790
Do not let this guy get to you.

860
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:57,908
You're getting to me.

861
00:33:57,985 --> 00:33:58,412
Me?

862
00:33:58,487 --> 00:33:59,607
Yes. You were an ass.

863
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:02,464
Look, I'm sorry I came back early.
I really messed things up here.

864
00:34:02,532 --> 00:34:05,729
Jess wrote a book. He wrote a book,
and you mocked him.

865
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,093
I did not mock him.

866
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:08,404
He's doing something.

867
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:09,669
Good. Fine. He's doing something.

868
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,753
Everybody in the world's doing something.
More power to him.

869
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,505
I'm not. I mean, what am I doing?

870
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:15,360
I'm living with my grandparents.

871
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:17,109
That's temporary. Have a drink.

872
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:18,862
Temporary can turn into forever.

873
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:20,469
You're not living with the Gilmores forever.

874
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:23,353
I'm palling with my grandmother
and being waited on by a maid.

875
00:34:23,432 --> 00:34:25,817
I come home,
and my shoes are magically shined.

876
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:28,646
My clothes are magically clean, ironed,
and laid out.

877
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,629
My bed is magically turned down.

878
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:31,978
I'm in the DAR?

879
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:35,237
I'm going to meetings and teas
and cocktail parties?

880
00:34:35,314 --> 00:34:37,736
Again, temporary. Have a drink.

881
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:42,100
And wasting my time partying and drinking,
just hanging out doing nothing.

882
00:34:42,183 --> 00:34:44,516
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't pull me into this.

883
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:45,777
I didn't say anything about you.

884
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:48,572
Yes, you did. Don't make me feel guilty
for your drinking and partying--

885
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:51,658
that's your choice. I'm not forcing you.
When I ask you out, you can say no.

886
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:52,649
It's all we do.

887
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,556
It's not all we do.

888
00:34:53,644 --> 00:34:54,778
It's all you do.

889
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,466
It's my prerogative, you know?

890
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:58,915
You're damn straight. I'm gonna party.

891
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:01,762
I'm gonna do it while I have the chance
because come June, my life is over.

892
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,909
Oh, yes,
your horrible life-- let's hear about it.

893
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:06,005
Got a week?

894
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:08,415
You have every door open to you.

895
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:11,944
You have opportunities that anyone
would kill for, including me.

896
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:14,339
No one's stopping you from making
whatever you want happen.

897
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:17,724
Go into journalism. Go into politics.
Be a doctor. Be a clown.
Do whatever you want.

898
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:20,225
It's not as easy when it's not handed to you.

899
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:22,423
Really? It's all so easy for me?

900
00:35:22,506 --> 00:35:24,975
I don't want that life. It's forced on me.

901
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,641
You talk about all these doors being open?

902
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:29,007
All I see is one door,
and I'm being pushed through it.

903
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,188
I have no choice.
You try living without options.

904
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,592
How hard are you fighting it?

905
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:35,080
I didn't tell you to quit Yale. You did that.

906
00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:38,019
I gave you one month,
you went beyond that month,
and it had nothing to do with me.

907
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:39,106
It was all you.

908
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:41,217
Now, you want to change? Change it,
but don't blame me.

909
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:42,598
Don't you dare blame me. You know what?

910
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,116
Why don't you go off with Jack,
whatever his name is?

911
00:35:45,198 --> 00:35:47,427
Oh, I'm not going off with Jess.

912
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:52,602
Come on.

913
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:54,317
Where?

914
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,997
Let's go. I want to go.
I don't want to be here.

915
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,879
I don't want to go.

916
00:35:57,965 --> 00:35:59,806
Well, I drove you here, and I want to go!

917
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:01,429
I don't want to go.

918
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:03,523
Fine.

919
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:07,403
I'll cover the bill, cab.

920
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:09,145
Do whatever you want. It's your choice.

921
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:21,562
Rory, it's 7:30.

922
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,268
Rory?

923
00:36:45,296 --> 00:36:46,318
Lorelai?

924
00:37:16,812 --> 00:37:18,069
Is he okay?

925
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,485
Yeah. He looks the same.

926
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:20,175
Is he breathing?

927
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,038
He's breathing.

928
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:21,945
Nice and steady?

929
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,196
He's fast asleep.

930
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,128
Good.

931
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:25,831
You been here all night?

932
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:28,182
Uh, I kept thinking I heard him.

933
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:30,507
Yeah, he does snore occasionally.

934
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:32,769
And then he was cold,
so I put his jersey on him.

935
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:34,454
Yeah, I think he likes it.

936
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,087
Yeah.

937
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:39,196
Every time I'd go back up to bed, you know,
after checking on him,

938
00:37:39,265 --> 00:37:42,994
I just was convinced that he needed me,
so I came back,

939
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:44,400
and finally I just ended up here.

940
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:46,583
That's as good a place as any.

941
00:37:47,074 --> 00:37:48,937
Yeah. He doesn't want to eat anything.

942
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:52,400
I had all these milk-bones ready for him,
but he doesn't want anything.

943
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,256
What's the baster for?

944
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:59,073
In case he's thirsty,
but he can't lift his head,
so I can just shoot water in his mouth.

945
00:37:59,169 --> 00:38:00,213
Got it.

946
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:03,729
Doesn't seem to want anything.

947
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,408
He's gonna be okay. He's strong.

948
00:38:08,335 --> 00:38:09,962
He's so helpless.

949
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:13,642
It must be so awful to be
sick when you're a dog...

950
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,246
'cause you can't run or play, and you don't
watch TV or do anything to pass the time.

951
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:22,467
Watching a lot of TV is the only
good part about being sick.

952
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:23,752
I know.

953
00:38:24,642 --> 00:38:27,902
And the thing with the shoes-- he
was trying to tell me something.

954
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:29,089
What?

955
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:33,864
He was trying to tell me to put my
shoes on and take him to the vet

956
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,039
because he felt something coming on,
and he was trying to ward it off,

957
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,331
and I didn't take him.

958
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:41,760
I don't think that's why he was
playing with your shoes.

959
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:44,872
I tried so hard.

960
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:52,810
I have a list of things that he's
afraid of on the fridge, and
I tried to do the right thing.

961
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:58,145
I should not have so socialized him at
Kirk's doggy day care the other day.

962
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,204
I should have taken him to the best
doggy day care in the country,
even if it was in Seattle.

963
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,649
That's where I should have taken him.

964
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:06,889
He's fine hanging with Kirk.

965
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,987
I did this wrong.

966
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:11,168
I did this all wrong.

967
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:14,633
How could I have let this happen?

968
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,423
How did I not see it coming?

969
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:21,942
How didn't I step in and do something, and...

970
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:24,495
why can't I fix these things?

971
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:25,268
Hey.

972
00:39:25,355 --> 00:39:26,677
I'm a bad mother!

973
00:39:26,749 --> 00:39:29,232
You're not a bad mother.

974
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:32,518
Oh. Did you sleep at all?

975
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,125
A little.

976
00:39:35,661 --> 00:39:37,587
You stay home this morning.

977
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,760
I'll call Sookie and tell her you'll be late.

978
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:44,714
He's gonna be okay.

979
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,429
I hope so.

980
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:52,073
Everything's gonna be okay.

981
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:03,157
Good morning, friend.

982
00:40:03,255 --> 00:40:04,213
Back at you, friend.

983
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:05,104
Where are the guys?

984
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:06,344
Uh, they go to work early.

985
00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:07,264
I made you coffee.

986
00:40:07,342 --> 00:40:09,051
Oh, I've got time for a sip.

987
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:10,890
Thanks for letting me crash here.

988
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:12,263
Anytime you want.

989
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:13,783
I might take you up on that.

990
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:15,716
I can't wait to hear the whole story.

991
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,024
Still living it.

992
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:21,697
So, I got a message on my cellphone,
from your grandmother.

993
00:40:21,814 --> 00:40:22,706
On your cellphone?

994
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:23,922
How did she get the number?

995
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:25,630
She's Emily Gilmore. I gotta run.

996
00:40:25,718 --> 00:40:26,248
Bye.

997
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,669
Drive carefully.

998
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:48,383
A fresh platter is all we need. Thanks.

999
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:50,213
I need to go somewhere and have
a little talk with you.

1000
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:51,713
Later, grandma. I'm needed out here.

1001
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:54,339
Young lady, I insist that we go
somewhere and talk right now.

1002
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:56,109
Grandma, I am sorry. I can't.

1003
00:40:56,183 --> 00:40:57,204
There's a kitchen here. We'll go there.

1004
00:40:57,284 --> 00:40:59,622
No. I'm not going to the kitchen with you.
We'll talk later.

1005
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:01,162
Must they play those damn guitars?

1006
00:41:01,245 --> 00:41:02,175
They're balalaikas.

1007
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:02,907
They're too loud.

1008
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,790
They're Russian, and they're not mic'ed.
That's their volume.

1009
00:41:04,868 --> 00:41:05,920
I'm not liking this tone of yours.

1010
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,408
Well, you're forcing a tone, grandma.

1011
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,621
I said I'll talk to you later, but right now,
I'm not leaving this room.

1012
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,600
Where were you last night?
Why didn't you call?

1013
00:41:12,694 --> 00:41:13,975
You're overreacting.

1014
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,339
You're not wearing your dress.

1015
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:16,786
I didn't have time to go home.

1016
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:17,958
You almost missed the event.

1017
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:19,422
No. I was early for the event.

1018
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:21,736
What I missed was your inspection
of me back at the house--

1019
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:22,917
that's what you're upset about.

1020
00:41:22,993 --> 00:41:26,452
My inspections, missy, are for your own good.
You're new to the DAR.

1021
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:28,730
You don't know the proper procedure
for things, the proper dress.

1022
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:29,560
I do okay.

1023
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:31,729
This is not just about me.
Everyone was worried about you.

1024
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:33,188
You mean everyone you called when you took

1025
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,361
my private address book and tried to find me?

1026
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:36,440
Yes, I did call people.

1027
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:37,403
Well, you shouldn't have.

1028
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:38,465
A lot of good it did.

1029
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,753
You should update that ridiculous
address book of yours.

1030
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:42,075
Half the numbers were disconnected.

1031
00:41:42,155 --> 00:41:43,216
Oh, I'll do that.

1032
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:45,084
You have people in there you
haven't spoken to for years.

1033
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:46,028
You should remove them.

1034
00:41:46,113 --> 00:41:46,597
Uh-huh.

1035
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,867
I'm throwing that book out.

1036
00:41:47,956 --> 00:41:49,184
Do not throw that book out.

1037
00:41:49,266 --> 00:41:50,390
Do not use that tone with me.

1038
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:51,748
I want to be very clear.

1039
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:54,387
You are becoming more like your
mother with every passing day.

1040
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:57,914
And you are becoming more like my mother's
mother with every passing day.

1041
00:41:58,034 --> 00:41:59,829
That's it. That's it.

1042
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,560
What's it?

1043
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,794
You're grounded.

1044
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:03,125
- Grounded?
- Yes.

1045
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:04,709
I'm 21. You can't ground me.

1046
00:42:04,782 --> 00:42:06,459
And no more sleepovers at Paris' house.

1047
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:09,180
Grandma, I go wherever I want,
whenever I want.

1048
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,994
And I haven't been sleeping at Paris'
house three nights a week.

1049
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:13,567
I've been at Logan's.

1050
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,152
When your father gets home,
we're going to talk about the house rules

1051
00:42:16,235 --> 00:42:18,330
and be on the same page once and for all.

1052
00:42:18,422 --> 00:42:20,025
You mean my grandfather.

1053
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:21,914
You know what I meant.

1054
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,612
Well, I'd have to be living at
the house to have house rules.

1055
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:25,543
What does that mean?

1056
00:42:25,636 --> 00:42:26,350
Excuse me.

1057
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:28,683
Young lady, do not walk away from me.
