1
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:05,996
This is humiliating.

2
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:08,114
Oh, no, we passed humiliating two minutes ago.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,151
Luke's gonna be completely out of doughnuts by the time we get there.

4
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:13,685
I don't why he won't just buy six extra sprinkled ones,

5
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:15,513
so we'd never have to have the conversation

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,152
which we're going to have- if we ever get there.

7
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,107
I got school in two hours. I'm never gonna make it.

8
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:20,208
Kirk, how you doing?

9
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:21,944
You sure?

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,277
You seem to be having a little trouble forming words there.

11
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:27,756
No... fine... me.

12
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:30,454
You know, you don't have to take us all the way to Luke's.

13
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:32,553
Yes, Kirk, listen to her.

14
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:37,094
I offered you the first ride in Kirk's new Stars Hollow Pedi-cab,

15
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:38,626
and that is exactly what you're gonna get.

16
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,408
Time just whizzes by when you're riding in a pedi-cab.

17
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:49,567
- Gypsy just out-strolled us. 
- We've gotta get outta here.

18
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:52,009
- How we doing back there? 
- We're doing fine, Kirk.

19
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:54,778
I figure this baby's gonna be a real money...

20
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:57,283
A real money- moneywhat, Kirk?

21
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,105
Kirk, can you breathe?

22
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:00,284
Talk to us.

23
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:03,084
Hit the handlebars three times if you can breathe and two if you can't.

24
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:06,135
- He hit once. 
- What does once mean?

25
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:07,559
That he couldn't make it to twice?

26
00:01:07,697 --> 00:01:09,202
Kirk. Kirk, stop, please.

27
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,127
Just for a second.

28
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,611
Then we'll be on our way... like the wind.

29
00:01:14,727 --> 00:01:16,366
Okay, you know what, Kirk?

30
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,834
This has been really fun,

31
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:20,892
but I think we'll just hoof it the rest of the way.

32
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:23,369
- But the ride wasn't over yet. 
- Yeah, but we don't want to hog the cab.

33
00:01:23,463 --> 00:01:25,167
- 'Cause there's only one. 
- But we'll tell our friends.

34
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:26,657
- What was wrong with the ride? 
- Nothing.

35
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:29,185
I mean, it's great for tourists who are new to the town

36
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:30,778
and want to make sure they don't miss a thing.

37
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,079
I wasn't going that slow.

38
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:35,034
No, you just maybe need a little more training before tourist season kicks in.

39
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:37,275
You know, take a spinning class or buy some legs.

40
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:39,533
- Sorry, Kirk. 
- You will be sorry.

41
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:44,351
You'll be sorry you turned down the chance to ride in Stars Hollow's first...

42
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,918
Now he's gonna hate us forever.

43
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:48,166
No, he's not. He's just gonna hate us till something shiny comes by.

44
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:52,575
Well, well, well. I guess it wasn't me that was slowing things down.

45
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:54,300
I guess it was my big, fat cargo.

46
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:56,753
- Freshman 15! 
- Kirk!

47
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,682
Can't wait to get my doughnut!

48
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:00,863
Stay away from my doughnut, Kirk! I mean it!

49
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:02,943
It's my doughnut! Freak!

50
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,677
You might as well stick your head in a sugar bowl.

51
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:00,967
If you can find one big enough.

52
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:02,744
You won't be able to eat like that forever, you know.

53
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:03,794
What are you getting?

54
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,790
All bran. Asher turned me on to it.

55
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:06,973
He's a romantic.

56
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,902
He wants me to live a long time and be healthy. That is romantic.

57
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,908
Okay. Just a joke. No reflection on your man-friend.

58
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:15,466
So after breakfast, I'm going to pick up the sign for our table,

59
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,019
and then I'll meet you in the courtyard.

60
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,555
Antioxidants.

61
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,116
Yeah, I'll meet you in the courtyard.

62
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,313
I'm actually really excited about this.

63
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:25,422
I mean, it's our first social protest of significance in college.

64
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:26,661
I know, it's so exciting.

65
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:28,681
We actually get to do something important,

66
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:30,424
make a difference, have a say in the world.

67
00:03:30,612 --> 00:03:33,782
Wouldn't it be amazing if we could just get one Burmese political prisoner released

68
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,687
- because of our petition? 
- You're thinking small, Geller.

69
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,385
- Let's get 'em all out. 
- Even the guilty ones.

70
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:38,411
- Hell, yeah. 
- Seriously?

71
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:39,711
'Cause that'd be great, really great.

72
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,429
Okay, so I'll pick you up at 7:00, Saturday morning.

73
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:44,365
- Okay, Glenn. 
- Thank you, seriously.

74
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:45,692
No problem, Glenn.

75
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:47,365
This is a turning point.

76
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:48,814
You know how you have them,

77
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:51,558
when even the angry voices in your head have to shut up for just a minute?

78
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:52,229
Sure.

79
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:54,441
Why is he so happy?

80
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,510
Oh, I couldn't get away earlier for spring break.

81
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,461
My friends are leaving without me. I need a ride,

82
00:03:58,558 --> 00:03:59,905
Glenn has a van, and there you go.

83
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,830
You're going to ride to Florida with a guy who's bummed

84
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:03,586
that he got turned down by that German cannibal?

85
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,978
That was just a rumor and, yes, I'm desperate.

86
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,641
Glenn's not that bad. I'm sure you'll be fine.

87
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:09,848
Hey, there's extra room in the van, in case you guys need a ride.

88
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:13,247
Oh, no, thank you. I don't think we're gonna do the whole spring break thing.

89
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,356
Ever since I broke up with Moondoggie, soakin' up the rays hasn't been the same.

90
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:18,168
It's going to be really fun. You're missing out.

91
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:20,948
I'm not really a spring break kind of gal, but thank you for the offer.

92
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,453
Okay, but if you change your mind...

93
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:23,927
Gary Gilmore's got room in the car -- got it.

94
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,897
Oh, Janet, if you have a chance, you should stop by

95
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,150
and sign our petition for political prisoners in Burma.

96
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:31,889
I'll try. Actually, I have to run out and get a new bathing suit

97
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:33,640
- before my class this afternoon. 
- Okay.

98
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:37,235
Think of all the tortured souls festering in Burma while you're at the size-2 rack.

99
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,283
I hate that she's thin.

100
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:50,879
- Hey, Luke. 
- I saw you come in.

101
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:52,943
- I was gonna get to you, okay? 
- Sorry?

102
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:54,822
If you don't like the service, you can go somewhere else.

103
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:57,628
- Who could not like the service? 
- I'm busy. You ready to order?

104
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:59,917
Coffee for now. Is everything okay?

105
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:00,976
You're not gonna eat?

106
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:03,332
No, I just came in for coffee and to show you something.

107
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,164
We got the sample stationery and postcards for the inn.

108
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:06,926
What?

109
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:09,742
You know, the stationery and the postcards that you leave in the guests' room

110
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:11,986
so that they can write a letter home saying,

111
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:14,167
"Having a great time- wish you were here." Which, of course, they don't,

112
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:16,328
because you were the thing they were trying to get away from in this first place.

113
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,739
- Nobody uses that stuff. 
- Oh, sure they do.

114
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:22,830
I have never once stayed in a hotel and used the stationery or written a postcard.

115
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,569
- Are you gonna order? 
- I did order, and what is with you?

116
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,540
Nothin'. I'm fine. The paper's fine. The postcards are fine.

117
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,412
I don't know why you're showing them to me anyhow.

118
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:31,763
Because you are an investor in the inn.

119
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:33,218
I want to keep you apprised of the goings-on.

120
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:35,590
I am not an investor. I loaned you money.

121
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,361
That is what investors do.

122
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,515
- An investor goes to meetings. 
- We're having a meeting.

123
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:41,435
They're involved in the business decisions.

124
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,211
Hello... stationary. Decide -- yes, no.

125
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:46,198
I'll get your coffee.

126
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,457
- Do you want to talk about it? 
- What?

127
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,800
Whatever it is that's put you in this charming mood.

128
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,696
I am not wearing my socks.

129
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:02,991
What?

130
00:06:03,636 --> 00:06:05,286
I am not wearing my socks.

131
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:07,383
So, what are those, someone else's?

132
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:08,547
- Yes. 
- What?

133
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,024
I am wearing someone else's socks.

134
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,424
- I'm sorry, I need more. 
- I spent the night at Nicole's place.

135
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,008
Also known as "your place".

136
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,645
Got up a little late, grabbed a pair of socks,

137
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,452
and it wasn't until I was halfway to work that I realized

138
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:21,753
they were someone else's socks.

139
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,431
And you're sure about this?

140
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:26,795
Hey, if there's one thing in this life I am sure about, it's my socks.

141
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:30,149
I buy the same brand in bulk, and I've been doing this for as long as I can remember.

142
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,002
My socks are all white with a red stripe.

143
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,072
These are white with a gold stripe and some sort of fruity padding in the toe.

144
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:39,010
- Maybe they're Jess' socks. 
- They are not Jess' socks.

145
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:40,936
Well, maybe when you went to the laundromat,

146
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:43,870
someone accidentally left a pair of socks in the dryer, and then your --

147
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,101
- I don't go to a laundromat. 
- Maybe they're Nicole's socks.

148
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,796
You know, her gym socks or...

149
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:51,596
you're not wearing your socks.

150
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,925
I am not wearing my socks.

151
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:57,320
Show your support for the Burmese prisoners.

152
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,420
Sign up now- take a stand.

153
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,112
This bowl of rice is all a Burmese prisoner gets to eat in a day.

154
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,384
One bowl- that's it.

155
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:07,566
No butter or soy sauce...

156
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:10,127
Enjoy your "Maxim." You couldn't read that in Burma!

157
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:11,457
- I'm freezing. 
- Me too.

158
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,257
Look at all these hypocrites passing by.

159
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:16,684
Everyone claims to be so politically aware,

160
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:20,197
but not one person can stop by for two seconds to sign a stupid petition.

161
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,052
People suck.

162
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,534
- You all suck! 
- Paris, the rice!

163
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:26,059
Great, we have one prop, and it's blowing away.

164
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,974
- You knocked it over. 
- You put it right in front of me.

165
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,478
How was I supposed to know you were gonna jump out of your seat like a maniac?

166
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,331
You know me. You room with me. You should have known.

167
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:33,728
Hey, Rory, Paris.

168
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,034
Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad you stopped by

169
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:39,883
because this is an issue that affects every person that has a heart and a soul.

170
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:42,428
A great injustice is being perpetrated on our watch,

171
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:43,903
and we've got to do something to stop it.

172
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,285
Aren't you gonna sign the petition?

173
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,257
No, I just needed a place to put my sandwich down.

174
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,308
Is that a raindrop?

175
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:51,470
Yep.

176
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,060
- Out of the way. 
- Move, move, move!

177
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,002
- Is it raining? 
- No, it's National Baptism Day.

178
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,282
Tie your tubes, idiot.

179
00:07:58,531 --> 00:07:59,534
- Wet. 
- Cold.

180
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:04,592
Go, go! I get the radiator.

181
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,985
- No way. 
- You got it last night.

182
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:06,693
I did not!

183
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,602
Paris, you took up the whole thing with your "Hey, Gore,

184
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:11,520
do not endorse me" sweatshirt, and my blue sweater is still soaked.

185
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:13,594
- Fine! Take half. 
- Oh, my god, I'm cold!

186
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,027
- Can't stop shaking. 
- We're wimps...

187
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:18,084
- we would last two seconds in Burma. 
- At least it's warm in Burma.

188
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:20,567
Yeah. Okay, we're horrible.

189
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:23,101
This is the kind of cold you read about in a Dickens novel.

190
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:25,201
We should be in a workhouse or shilling for Fagin.

191
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:27,797
It's supposed to be spring. Why is it still cold?

192
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,723
It's been the coldest winter in the history of winter.

193
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,997
My brain- I think it's frozen. Is that possible?

194
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,507
And these gray skies- it's a blanket of misery.

195
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:39,190
All I can think about is getting warm. That's all I can think about.

196
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,810
It's warm in Florida.

197
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:48,712
- What? 
- Nothing.

198
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,478
- Did you say "Florida"? 
- No.

199
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,059
- Yes. 
- Seriously?

200
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:55,179
- Maybe. 
- But it's spring break.

201
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,022
I know.

202
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,167
It's "girls gone wild," and boys doing the twist.

203
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,017
We're not spring-breaky people, are we?

204
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:02,086
I don't know what we are, but I am so cold right now

205
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:04,774
that the thought of spending a week with a bunch of drunken bimbos

206
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:08,213
and rattle-headed frat boys seems like a very good trade off for being warm.

207
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:09,904
Warm...

208
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:12,495
Warm...

209
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:19,048
- Mom, where's my bathing suit? 
- Do you have a bathing suit?

210
00:09:19,197 --> 00:09:21,589
- Of course I have a bathing suit. 
- When was the last time you wore it?

211
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:22,751
I don't remember.

212
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:26,330
- Did it involve a rubber ducky? 
- No... I don't think.

213
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,542
Check the bottom drawer, and I will look in your closet.

214
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:31,802
So now, tell me again- who's driving?

215
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:33,390
Glenn. It's his mom's van.

216
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:35,126
And this Glenn- he's a good driver?

217
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:38,346
- I have no idea. 
- Kid, you've got to learn to lie.

218
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:40,655
Glenn's a very responsible guy. I'm sure it will be fine.

219
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,273
And the place you're staying is safe?

220
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:45,560
Now you're catching on. Aha! Bathing suit.

221
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:47,777
Now we just have to find the wimple that goes with it.

222
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,776
Give me that, please.

223
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,268
Hey, was I supposed to clear this with you first?

224
00:09:51,377 --> 00:09:52,693
- Clear what with me? 
- Going away.

225
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:53,946
Oh, I don't know.

226
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:56,456
I mean, I don't live here anymore, so I'm not sure what the protocol is.

227
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:58,744
Ah, well. I think as long as I know now,

228
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:01,520
and I feel as if I have veto power, we're good.

229
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:02,452
You have veto power?

230
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:05,051
No. I feel as if I have veto power- very different statement.

231
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:05,886
Got it.

232
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:07,894
But you'll call me a lot while you're there, right?

233
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:09,082
You're not worried, are you?

234
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:11,668
Because I'm just going for the sun and to read, nothing more.

235
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,143
I know, I know. It's just it's always the good kids who've never had a drink

236
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,950
that take one sip of Kahlua and fall out of a window.

237
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,638
So you're sad you never taught me how to drink?

238
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:20,582
Exactly!

239
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,456
Well grab a bottle and some quarters and let's go.

240
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,047
- No falling out of windows. 
- Not even a first floor one.

241
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:27,478
And don't drink. And after you're done not drinking,

242
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:29,644
drink tons of water and take two aspirin before you go to bed.

243
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:30,339
Got it.

244
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:33,289
And take Paris with you everywhere. Not much can happen with that girl along.

245
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:33,991
Got it.

246
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:35,593
They're here.

247
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,279
Maybe they can stop by a bathing suit store along the way.

248
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,442
My suit is fine.

249
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,989
No, sure it is.

250
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,087
It's nice to be able to go from the beach to the mosque

251
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,171
without having to change.

252
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,240
Seriously, Paris, get out!

253
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:52,745
No! I have to drive.

254
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:54,511
You drive exactly like you look like you drive.

255
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,392
What's that supposed to mean?

256
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:58,106
You speed like a maniac. You zip in and out of s. You tailgate.

257
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:00,595
- They were going two miles an hour. 
- It was a driving-school car.

258
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:03,348
Well, they went to school to learn a lesson. I was just giving them their money's worth.

259
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:05,418
Hey, guys.

260
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:07,348
Let's go. We're on a schedule. Get away from Glenn.

261
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:09,790
- Thank god you're here. 
- Glenn, this is my mom.

262
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:13,415
Hi, I'm Lorelai. Hey, congratulations on being student of the month

263
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,572
at Grandville Middle School.

264
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:15,171
Thanks.

265
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:17,875
- You lookin' forward to the beach? 
- Yes, I am.

266
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:20,388
You know, you don't have to show up in what you're going to wear.

267
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:21,534
They'll let you change when you get there.

268
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:22,338
I'm not cold.

269
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:23,533
No, of course not.

270
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:24,910
Could you? Thanks.

271
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,554
- So, how come Paris is driving? 
- Are we gonna go through this again?

272
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:30,040
I didn't know we'd already gone through it.

273
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:32,026
I can't be in a car if anybody else is driving, okay?

274
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,314
If I die in a car crash, it's going to be at my own hand.

275
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,585
- Hi, Paris. 
- Hi, Lorelai.

276
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:36,865
- No windows. 
- No windows.

277
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:41,627
Oh, hey, Glenn, would you mind if Rory sits up front? She gets carsick.

278
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,060
Oh. Okay.

279
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,294
Airbags.

280
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,726
- Okay, have fun. Drive safely. 
- Let's go... and say a prayer for the road kill.

281
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:07,754
You're a lunatic!

282
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:10,831
Hey, I shaved three hours off the MapQuest estimate.

283
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,719
How about a "thank you" for that? Who's in charge here?

284
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:14,415
I'm guessing pink shirts and white shorts?

285
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,295
I think my clothing choice has been vindicated.

286
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:19,144
Swank attire and desperation for approval. The chicks are gonna eat you up.

287
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,537
It is warm. Are you feeling the warmth?

288
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:22,981
I'm definitely starting to thaw.

289
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,013
- Name, please. 
- It's under "Billings."

290
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:28,706
We have you girls in room 6.

291
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:30,621
Room 6, okay. And what is your name?

292
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:31,194
Jack.

293
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:34,378
Jack. Well, Jack, hello. I'm Paris, and this is Andrew.

294
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:36,663
And we just want to make sure that we're getting your very best room.

295
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:40,578
Actually, room 9 has a better view, and it's closer to the ice machine.

296
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:43,261
Let's go with 9. Now, who's gonna help with our bags?

297
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:46,574
Good. Okay, those four bags... Rory, your book bag?

298
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:47,455
Sure.

299
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:50,625
- I'm gonna go for a run. 
- Now?

300
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,145
Just a short one around the block.

301
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,162
She looks so normal, and then that happens.

302
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,756
Come on.

303
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:57,479
Paris Geller, room 9. Remember that.

304
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,910
See, a lot of people make the mistake of tipping at the end of a trip.

305
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:02,584
But I always tip as you go along.

306
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,801
That way, they never know when the honey pot dries up,

307
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:07,299
and it keeps them from going through your stuff and robbing you blind.

308
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,150
Paris Geller, room 9. Remember that.

309
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,829
Oh, man, look at that. We're right on the ocean.

310
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:17,642
Paris, look at it. It's right there.

311
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:18,364
I see it.

312
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:21,433
Oh, hey, we're in room 9.

313
00:13:21,528 --> 00:13:23,397
Feel free to keep the sheets clean and the towels coming.

314
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,837
Okay... not bad.

315
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:28,537
Hey, you know what would be swell?

316
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:30,520
A VCR to go with that television set. You mind?

317
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:33,279
You're aces, pal...really. I'm giving the toast at your wedding.

318
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,875
Well, at least it doesn't smell bad in here.

319
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:37,420
Pull your covers down and roll on the bed.

320
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:38,044
Why?

321
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:39,792
We are sharing this room with four other girls, Rory.

322
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:41,978
Plus 10K Barbie- we have to stake out our territory.

323
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:44,015
Yes, and then we need to up your dosage.

324
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:48,316
Look, a person comes in, they see a dent in the bed, possibly a hair on the pillow...

325
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:49,975
So the person's David Caruso?

326
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,837
They'll figure that bed is taken. They will then move on to the couch or the rollaway.

327
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:55,223
- That's insane. 
- Okay, suit yourself.

328
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:03,912
And I was worried I would I feel stupid.

329
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:05,520
Stupid but well rested.

330
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:07,112
How long do we have to do this?

331
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:08,592
I think we're good.

332
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,292
- I'm really comfortable right now. 
- Yeah, me, too.

333
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:16,548
Sounds like more are arriving.

334
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:19,508
- Where are you going? 
- To see what all the ruckus is about.

335
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:20,876
Wait for me- I like ruckus.

336
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:25,571
Man, that's a lot of people stuck in that tiny car.

337
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:27,101
They should all be wearing Shriner hats.

338
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,829
Hmm, that was subtle.

339
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:34,996
What are you talking about?

340
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:37,074
The Joanie loves Chachi moment.

341
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:38,688
- He said "hey." 
- I heard.

342
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:39,937
- I said "hey" back. 
- You did.

343
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,806
I was being polite.

344
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,397
In Burma, you'd be married... or brutally killed.

345
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:44,575
I'm gonna go make your bed.

346
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:47,084
Don't you dare. Man, I'm thirsty.

347
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,056
Root beer?

348
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:52,737
Paris, that guy doesn't work here.

349
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:55,579
Not yet. But look at that mug of his, it's only a matter of time.

350
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:02,035
- I overslept again. 
- I know.

351
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,836
- Why didn't you get me up? 
- I tried, and you bit me.

352
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:05,573
I did not bite you.

353
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,452
I did bite you -- cool!

354
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:10,006
Here, eat this before it gets cold.

355
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:11,696
You made French toast?

356
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:14,041
Well, I had a lot of energy after my run, so...

357
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,025
You went running?

358
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,498
Well, I had to wait for the laundry to dry. And I had already read the papers.

359
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:18,951
You had an entire day before I woke up.

360
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:19,848
Here, you want bacon?

361
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,689
You went out and slaughtered a pig between the running and the French toast?

362
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:26,268
Yes, and by the way, that whole ozone-layer problem... taken care of.

363
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:27,456
You're my Green Party hero.

364
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:29,627
- Here. 
- Oh, no - can't.

365
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:31,951
I have to get to the printers and pick up the brochures

366
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:34,281
because today is mailing day. But do you have a baggie?

367
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:36,799
- Yeah, here. 
- Perfect.

368
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:47,423
- What are you doing? 
- This is French toast on the go.

369
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:48,863
The other drivers on the road love it.

370
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:52,652
Come here. I'll call you later. We'll plan our weekend.

371
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,764
Hey, Lorelai, hold on a second.

372
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:58,765
- Here. 
- A key.

373
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,940
Yeah, it's a key to the apartment.

374
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,886
Oh... good.

375
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:04,658
Do you want me to let someone in?

376
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,767
No, it's just an extra key.

377
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,303
I thought, you know, if you were coming over

378
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:10,961
and I was running late this way you didn't have to wait in the hallway.

379
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:14,324
Or if you were carrying something,

380
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:17,479
and you couldn't wait for me to get to the door... this way, you're all set.

381
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,874
Okay... good. Makes sense.

382
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:21,754
Yeah, it's just a practical thing. It's not a big deal.

383
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:23,592
- Oh, good. 
- Or you don't have to take it.

384
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,809
- No, I'll take it. 
- I mean, I know how it is.

385
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,841
You've got your keys on your ring just so,

386
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:30,882
and then you put in a new one- it throws off the whole balance.

387
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,470
- Well, if you think... 
- Or you can keep it.

388
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:34,242
- You sure? 
- If you want.

389
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,443
- I can go either way. 
- It's fine with me.

390
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,763
- Well, which way? 
- Either way.

391
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,225
Well, I'll take it, Okay? Thanks for the French toast.

392
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,042
- Thanks for the hand injury. 
- Anytime.

393
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:45,731
Bye.

394
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:51,947
Here- it's over here.

395
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:53,595
Whoa, how did we get a tent?

396
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:55,468
Toby, again. Classic tip whore.

397
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:57,808
- Which one's Toby? 
- The one with the bandaged hand.

398
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,533
He cut it setting this up. I popped him another sawbuck.

399
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:03,011
Cool tent! How'd we get it?

400
00:17:03,226 --> 00:17:06,343
Stay ignorant, Glenn. It comes with the oppressive guilt of the ruling class.

401
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,119
Okay. Hey, Janet. I like your suit.

402
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,225
Thanks, Glenn.

403
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:12,524
Hey...hot dogs.

404
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:16,599
Man, it is so loud out here. You never think of the beach as being loud.

405
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:19,543
You do when there's a band of Huns re-enacting "Top Gun" in back of you.

406
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,539
- Hey! Throw it back. 
- No!

407
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,960
- What are you doing? 
- Putting a towel down.

408
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:25,974
- Don't. 
- Why?

409
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,700
We have, like, a hundred towels in the room.

410
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,205
There's so many towels, there's basically no room for us.

411
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,907
- I need my ball. 
- You need a couple of 'em, pal.

412
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:35,964
Here. Ignore her. She likes it.

413
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:38,883
- Rory, stop. 
- I'm not gonna sit in the sand, Paris.

414
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:40,131
Over here.

415
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:44,514
Great....okay. Thanks.

416
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,610
Now, we're going to need a fruit plate in about an hour

417
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:50,504
and keep the ice tea coming.

418
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:54,862
- What? 
- Nothing but admiration here.

419
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,777
I'm going to go do my laps in the ocean.

420
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,165
You're gonna work out on spring break?

421
00:17:58,282 --> 00:17:59,838
Exercise is a high. You should try it.

422
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:00,933
Sure. I'll meet you out there.

423
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:02,178
Are you properly sun-screened?

424
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,385
Ten minutes in the sun can cause irreparable skin damage.

425
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,577
And constant shoulder tension creates a hunchback.

426
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:09,209
Fine, go. I hear melanoma is very in this year.

427
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:11,026
Here, Casper, you better use this.

428
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:12,633
You're just lucky you got a fruit plate coming.

429
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:17,313
- Rory, Paris! Oh, my God! 
- Hello, ladies!

430
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:19,462
Unbelievable. What are you guys doing here?

431
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,463
Spring break!

432
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:22,662
Actually we came for Tu's spring break and just stayed.

433
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:24,435
- We've been here a month. 
- They have great lifeguards.

434
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,843
I'm so excited to see you guys.

435
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:28,136
Paris, you missed a spot. I can see skin.

436
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:31,224
- So, when did you get here? 
- 2:00 this morning.

437
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,986
I love 2:00 in the morning.

438
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,189
You guys are having a good time?

439
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:36,984
- Way better than most other people. 
- We're very competitive.

440
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:40,415
It took a couple of weeks to get the right routine down, but now we own this town.

441
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:41,817
The chamber of commerce must be thrilled.

442
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:45,561
I think the last place on earth I would ever expect to find Paris Geller is at spring break.

443
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:46,850
Hey, I'm up for new things.

444
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:48,509
Okay, well then we have to make sure you do this right.

445
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:51,448
- There are rules. 
- There always are in a civilized society.

446
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:55,361
First of all, it is very important to find the right hot club every night and it changes.

447
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,444
What was hot last night is not tonight.

448
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,918
Also, adjust your sleeping patterns for maximum partying.

449
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:02,640
Mid-to-late-afternoon sleeping allows the best all-night stamina.

450
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:03,891
Okay. You got that, Paris?

451
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,467
Were we really friends at one point?

452
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:07,889
They do card at the clubs, but there's a million ways around it.

453
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,829
- Major flirting... 
- A sexy voice...

454
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,421
And, if all that fails, make out.

455
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:12,538
- With who? 
- Each other.

456
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:13,295
Excuse me?

457
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,748
We found that if we kiss each other, we can get anything we want from guys.

458
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:16,982
Free drinks, food...

459
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:19,942
- T-shirts, boat rides, Frisbees... 
- Earrings, Seadoos...

460
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,031
Okay. Well, that is a good tip.

461
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:24,105
Yeah, maybe later I'll pants you for an Altoid.

462
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:26,024
- Hey, where are you staying? 
- The Sea Sprite.

463
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,611
- That's cute. 
- We've made out there.

464
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:31,580
- Louise, it's 1:00. 
- We've got to go get to bed.

465
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:33,320
We'll come see you tonight.

466
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:36,200
- Hey, guys! 
- How 'bout a lift?

467
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,034
I liked the pants-you-for-an-Altoid thing.

468
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:43,320
Oh, my God, I'm starving.

469
00:19:43,522 --> 00:19:45,317
I can't believe what a great video store that was.

470
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:47,139
A little research before a trip never hurts.

471
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:49,735
Pizza and "The Power of Myth"

472
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,120
A perfect evening.

473
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:54,482
What?

474
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:56,893
Nothing- just checking the messages, that's all.

475
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,434
Are you expecting a call from Asher?

476
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:00,015
No, I'm not expecting a call.

477
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:03,319
He's at a conference in Denver, so I'm not expecting a call.

478
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:07,154
I mean, he knows I'm here, and I left him a contact number in case of emergencies,

479
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:08,929
but not expecting a call.

480
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,423
God, I love this. I've seen it four times.

481
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:18,919
- Five. 
- Seriously?

482
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:22,268
It was almost six, but my mom tried to be funny one day and hid it.

483
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:23,497
I thought you and your mom got along?

484
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,192
Even we have our dark periods.

485
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,276
Wow, it sounds like quite a party out there.

486
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:31,929
I think someone just got thrown in the pool.

487
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:34,674
I hope it's the guy who took my five bucks and never brought me a root beer.

488
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:35,804
This is a good song.

489
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:39,051
Okay, I'm sorry, are we doing this right?

490
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,531
- Doing what right? 
- Spring break.

491
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,460
I mean, we're in here alone with Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers,

492
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:45,549
and everyone else is out there with...

493
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,100
- Everyone else? 
- Yeah.

494
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:50,684
- But... we love Bill Moyers. 
- Yes, we do love Bill Moyers.

495
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:53,280
But we did come here for spring break, and

496
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:58,150
I'm just wondering if we're not spring-breaking the way you're supposed to spring break.

497
00:20:58,369 --> 00:20:59,265
You're probably right.

498
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:01,640
I mean, if we're here, we should probably commit.

499
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:03,351
Try to experience the entire event.

500
00:21:03,474 --> 00:21:05,297
With other people, outside this room.

501
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:08,011
Okay. Let's do it. Let's commit.

502
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,690
- Okay. Starting now? 
- Starting now.

503
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:18,854
- Tomorrow's fine, too. 
- Absolutely.

504
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,013
I got $5 on the blond with the tattoo.

505
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,845
You always go for the tattoos.

506
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:38,019
God, I'm starving. I haven't had anything but vending-machine junk.

507
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,284
There's nothing around here.

508
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:41,398
I would kill for something non-synthetic.

509
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:44,230
Ohh! Perfect.

510
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:49,360
Okay, forget I said "giant Q-tips." They're not hitting each other with giant Q-tips.

511
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:52,443
But now I can't get giant Q-tips out of my head. It's too powerful a visual.

512
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:53,810
I know, I'm sorry.

513
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,324
- So how is it? 
- It's good so far.

514
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:58,622
- Yeah, how good? 
- I haven't had a drink yet.

515
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,732
Okay, are you sure you weren't drinking,

516
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:02,190
and that's why you think they're giant Q-tips?

517
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:06,016
Maybe.

518
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,808
Hello? What just happened?

519
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:13,160
You sound distracted. Did something cute just walk by?

520
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:17,766
No, I was just trying to think of something better to describe the...

521
00:22:18,268 --> 00:22:20,485
the giant Q-tips. So I'll call you later, okay?

522
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:21,857
- No windows. 
- No windows.

523
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:28,502
What?

524
00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:30,987
- Excellent taste. 
- What's his name?

525
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:33,858
- Whose name? 
- The guy you were just staring at.

526
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,662
- I wasn't staring. 
- Oh, no.

527
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:39,008
- The twins. 
- God, they're everywhere.

528
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,103
- So? 
- We can't compete against twins.

529
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:43,110
Especially once they caught on to the whole kissing thing.

530
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:44,468
Let's find another pool.

531
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:46,474
- We'll see you guys tonight. 
- Okay.

532
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:51,419
Hey, why don't you go get us something at the bar?

533
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,252
What?

534
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:54,831
Then you can go talk to that guy.

535
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:00,094
- That's okay. 
- Come on- go.

536
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:03,641
Flirting seems to be a very big part of this spring break ritual, and I'm taken.

537
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:06,157
I can't flirt. I have to live vicariously through you.

538
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:10,652
The banana-eating contest is about to start on the upper level.

539
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,738
- Oh, real food. Thank god. 
- Paris.

540
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:30,390
Hey, do you know what those things are called

541
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:32,641
that they hit each other in the pool with?

542
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:34,469
No, I don't.

543
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,060
Oh, just wondering.

544
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:41,561
- Do I lose points for that? 
- No, no points lost.

545
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:43,856
- Hey, Sean, man, come on! 
- Comin'.

546
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:46,860
- See ya. 
- Oh, okay.

547
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:48,330
See ya.

548
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,661
Excuse me for thinking a banana-eating contest was about eating a banana!

549
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:51,610
- You guys want something? 
- Maybe later.

550
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:52,792
We'll be back.

551
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,476
Wow, quite a scene.

552
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,734
Yeah, I guess we found the hot place tonight.

553
00:26:32,964 --> 00:26:35,473
Yep, no one can sniff out the hip like we can.

554
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:37,797
Okay, so, here we are.

555
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,559
We should do something.

556
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:41,544
- What? 
- I don't know.

557
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:45,497
- We could dance. 
- Dance... okay, sure.

558
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:47,327
- Let's- let's dance. 
- Okay, let's dance.

559
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:51,705
- This is fun. 
- Yep.

560
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:56,957
- Hey, I think your husband's here. 
- What? Where?

561
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,540
- Why don't you go buy him a drink? 
- What, like a nice ginger ale?

562
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,979
Well, maybe you could get Madeline and Louise to buy a drink for you,

563
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:07,299
and then you could go bring it to him.

564
00:27:19,336 --> 00:27:21,397
Well, that was the shortest relationship ever.

565
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:21,923
What?

566
00:27:22,096 --> 00:27:23,771
He looked, he saw, he changed his mind.

567
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:24,615
Sorry.

568
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:36,591
- Okay, what is going on here? 
- What?

569
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,874
Why is every single person in this place having a better time than we are?

570
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,640
Well, I don't know that they are.

571
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:45,603
Look around. Every single person in this place is having a better time than we are.

572
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,439
Why? I mean, we've been doing everything everybody else is.

573
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:50,277
We're here, in the hot place.

574
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:51,635
So we're not great dancers.

575
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:54,497
We did the hanging out at the pool part pretty well.

576
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:55,700
We're not trying hard enough.

577
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:57,687
What are you talking about? This is not a test.

578
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:01,036
We came here to do spring break, and we are going to do spring break.

579
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,277
Well, what else do you suggest we do?

580
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:06,717
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

581
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:08,096
Well, Madeline and Louise do it.

582
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:11,403
Madeline and Louise wear their underwear outside of their clothes.

583
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:13,272
I don't want to do what Madeline and Louise do.

584
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,361
- I just thought... 
- Just stop thinking, okay?

585
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:17,003
Your thinking is very, very dangerous.

586
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:19,175
- Rory... 
- Get away from me! You're not my type.

587
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,702
- Will you just wait? 
- What?

588
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,396
- How was I? 
- What?

589
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:24,024
- As a kisser? 
- Oh, man!

590
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:26,250
Well, I've always wanted to know, and you can't ask a guy

591
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,914
'cause that's a sign of low self esteem, which I've read is really not sexy.

592
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:30,628
So tell me- how am I? Too stiff?

593
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:34,299
Do I need to relax my lips a little, maybe open my mouth more, make it more inviting?

594
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:35,570
I need some fresh air.

595
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,364
- Hey. Where you goin'? 
- Outside.

596
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,068
- Can I come with you? 
- Oh, well...

597
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:42,580
Maybe your girlfriend wants to come, too.

598
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:43,536
My girlfriend?

599
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:45,318
I gotta tell you- that was some kiss.

600
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:46,188
Oh, my God!

601
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:51,062
So the movie was good. Nice to see Michael Caine working again.

602
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:53,305
Which was sarcastic...

603
00:28:54,284 --> 00:28:56,275
'cause he works a lot...

604
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:58,337
constantly.

605
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:02,173
Never says "no" to anything, which can be risky, you know? Lowers your batting average.

606
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,427
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

607
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:07,748
Jason, you're making me work too hard tonight.

608
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:08,404
I know.

609
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:12,392
I mean, I wore the cute boots, you know? Do you see the cute boots?

610
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:13,830
Very cute boots.

611
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:15,976
Well, I've had a full night, what with the walking straight,

612
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,995
the balancing, and the not yelping out in pain.

613
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:20,642
If I'd known I'd also had to do all the talking...

614
00:29:20,753 --> 00:29:21,819
I think I did it wrong.

615
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,588
- You did what wrong? 
- The key that I gave you.

616
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,258
The key... to your apartment?

617
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,163
The key was supposed to say something.

618
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,995
So it's a talking key.

619
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:35,274
Look, you and I are hitting that point in a relationship where I usually break it off.

620
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:38,714
Oh, well, gee, should we get a cake?

621
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:42,652
Every single time with every other woman I've been involved with,

622
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,810
this is about the time that I would...

623
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,097
- Bolt? 
- I was gonna say "run,"

624
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:48,601
but "bolt" sounds much more masculine, so yeah, sure, "bolt."

625
00:29:48,683 --> 00:29:54,388
Well, it's time to bolt. Okay, good thing you're not wearing my boots.

626
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:56,297
I don't think I'm doing this right, either.

627
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,412
No, no, you're doing it just fine.

628
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:00,193
It's cold, so...

629
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:03,803
The other night I woke up and the timer went off in my head-

630
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,089
"Hey, buddy, it's about that time." So I did what I always do.

631
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:08,800
I thought about you, and I thought about us,

632
00:30:08,897 --> 00:30:10,510
and I thought about all the things that bother me,

633
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,946
and I came up with nothing.

634
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:15,477
Nothing?

635
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,973
I went over it and over it in my head.

636
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:24,283
That feeling, that "I want out" feeling- it wasn't there.

637
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:29,424
What was there was the very strong sense that if I did... bolt...

638
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,604
I might as well go out and find a pointy hat,

639
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,681
a stool, and a classroom full of sixth graders,

640
00:30:34,738 --> 00:30:38,179
because I'd be an absolute idiot to screw this up.

641
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:41,000
So I went out and made the key.

642
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:42,731
The talking key.

643
00:30:43,494 --> 00:30:46,689
And I was hoping that the key would say that this is different,

644
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:51,122
and that I want you in my life a lot more than you are now.

645
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:57,452
Well, I mean, it would have been more interesting to hear that from the key...

646
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,070
it's definitely more romantic hearing it from you.

647
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:10,814
I'm gonna go take care of Mr. Caine for you now.

648
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:12,017
I would appreciate that.

649
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:13,000
Good night.

650
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:14,301
Good night, Jason.

651
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:26,615
Hey, it's Luke.

652
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:28,524
I'm sorry to be calling you like this,

653
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:30,568
but I was wondering if, when you get this message,

654
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:32,713
you could come pick me up 'cause I need a ride.

655
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:36,009
I'm in Litchfield, the corner of Mason and Pine.

656
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:39,571
It's a big, white building. You'll recognize it by the police sign outside

657
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:41,745
because, oh, hell, I'm in jail.

658
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:45,139
Okay, there I said it. Long story. I'll tell you when you get here.

659
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:45,734
Thanks...

660
00:31:46,086 --> 00:31:48,197
if you come. Oh, one more thing.

661
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:50,393
I need to borrow a little money- 300 bucks.

662
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,923
It's just a loan, and,

663
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:54,514
oh, hell, it's for my bail.

664
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:56,454
I'm gettin' off now! Relax!

665
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:02,066
I think the two of you would make a great couple.

666
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,883
- No way. 
- Why not?

667
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,059
You're way too high maintenance for me.

668
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:08,148
The whole place was buzzing about the kiss.

669
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:09,700
Even the twins were jealous.

670
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,850
Super, great. Love to hear that.

671
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:15,209
Who needs more? Everybody? Good. I'll be right back.

672
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:19,485
So, Paris, how's the Princeton man?

673
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:20,595
Jaime and I broke up.

674
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:22,432
Paris has a different man now.

675
00:32:22,643 --> 00:32:24,328
-  You do? 
- I'm dating a professor.

676
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:26,043
- Tenured? 
- Ages ago.

677
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:27,932
Well, Anna Nicole, look at you.

678
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,291
He's brilliant, a writer, very distinguished, handsome.

679
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:33,748
- Don't you think he's handsome? 
- Handsome? Sure, very handsome.

680
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:37,067
He's a real man. He's just so amazing.

681
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,920
I still can't believe that we're together, you know?

682
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:40,993
I made them a little stronger this time.

683
00:32:41,178 --> 00:32:43,487
Oh, cool, it will be fun to watch the cups dissolve.

684
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,993
Paris bagged herself an older man.

685
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:48,234
Oh, I love older men. They take you to the best restaurants.

686
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,343
He went to a conference in Denver this week.

687
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:53,527
He was so nice, you know- really excited about me coming to Florida.

688
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:56,518
He thinks it's a good idea to hang out with people my own age.

689
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:59,497
I kind of hoped that he would invite me to go to Denver with him but,

690
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,493
- you know, he didn't. 
- He had to work, Paris.

691
00:33:02,595 --> 00:33:04,668
- I know, or he's sick of me. 
- No.

692
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:06,910
Maybe he's going to dump me.

693
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:09,215
Does he still buy you jewelry?

694
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:10,430
He's never bought me jewelry.

695
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:13,055
He hasn't? How much money does he have?

696
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:15,129
- Asher isn't rich. 
- Not rich?

697
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:17,367
Oh, curiouser and curiouser.

698
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:19,649
You're just being paranoid. He wants you to have fun.

699
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:22,368
And someone who wants you to have fun is someone who cares about you...

700
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,782
both of you because there are two of you, and they're spinning.

701
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:28,635
Good punch.

702
00:33:28,928 --> 00:33:31,140
Just keep me away from any windows, please.

703
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:32,797
Whatever happened to that boyfriend of yours?

704
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:33,608
Who, Jess?

705
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,752
- No. 
- Oh, Dean.

706
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:36,761
Dean, that's it.

707
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:39,879
How's Dean? God, he was gorgeous.

708
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:42,347
- He's fine. 
- Is he still gorgeous?

709
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,186
Oh, yes. Definitely, yes.

710
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:46,223
You two aren't together?

711
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,492
No, actually he's married.

712
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,192
- What? 
- Why?

713
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:53,203
Well, he met Lindsay, and they got married.

714
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:56,560
She's pretty, blond, tall, leggy.

715
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,910
Oh, good, just what the world needs -- another one of those.

716
00:33:59,393 --> 00:34:01,431
- She's nice, too. 
- Prediction...

717
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:02,997
- She's psychic. 
- Since when?

718
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:06,042
Since about six months ago. I think it's not gonna last.

719
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:09,857
Two married 19-year-olds won't make it- boy, that's a risky bet.

720
00:34:09,995 --> 00:34:12,316
I think it's not gonna last because he was way too in love with you.

721
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,528
No. But we've been broken up for a long time.

722
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:18,766
But he only had eyes for you, girlfriend- a deep, long, soulful Rory-eyes.

723
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,251
No, not anymore.

724
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:21,859
You don't talk at all anymore?

725
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,419
No, we still talk. We're still friends.

726
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:27,009
Yes, you are. Cell phone friends.

727
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:29,456
You have your ex-boyfriend's number in your cell phone?

728
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:31,131
I told you we were friends.

729
00:34:31,643 --> 00:34:33,318
First loves are very intense.

730
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:35,407
My mom's still in love with her first love.

731
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:38,560
She tells my father that over and over and...

732
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,839
Oops, I think I just dialed his number.

733
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:43,144
- Madeline, no! 
- Oh, my God, it's ringing!

734
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:45,052
- Hang up! 
- It's his voice mail.

735
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:47,424
- Oh, sexy voice.
- Hang up, Madeline !

736
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:49,997
Oops, I think it's gonna... it beeped.

737
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:51,381
Talk.

738
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,014
Dean, hi.

739
00:34:54,185 --> 00:34:58,314
It's Rory. I'm sorry to call you like this, but we're on spring break...

740
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:03,100
And, I don't know if you remember Madeline and Louise, but they're evil,

741
00:35:03,306 --> 00:35:05,737
and we were just talking about you.

742
00:35:06,715 --> 00:35:09,031
Hi. How are you?

743
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:12,798
I'm gonna hang up now, so bye. Sorry, good-bye.

744
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:17,100
I'm going to kill you! Oh, my God, I'm so gonna kill you!

745
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:19,189
It's going to be bad and death-like, and...

746
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:22,803
I'm gonna go for a walk because this punch is starting to live up to its name.

747
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:23,791
I'll go with you.

748
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:26,500
Don't move because I'm going to come back to kill you.

749
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:27,626
We'll be here.

750
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:32,644
There- my truck.

751
00:35:42,078 --> 00:35:45,797
You know, Luke, you don't have to tell me what happened unless you want to.

752
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:51,583
But I promise I won't ask you about it again...

753
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:54,359
ever... in this lifetime or the next.

754
00:35:56,484 --> 00:35:58,153
You know, I'll just tell Shirley MacLaine,

755
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:01,603
"Hey, look, back off, Shirl. If Luke had wanted me to know,

756
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,391
he would have told me back in my other lifetime, and I certainly don't expect-"

757
00:36:05,478 --> 00:36:06,989
I wanted to see who owned the socks.

758
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,345
And did you?

759
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:09,749
I think so.

760
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:12,503
I just had a feeling tonight.

761
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,571
Nicole was kind of vague on her plans, so...

762
00:36:16,323 --> 00:36:19,636
I told her I'd stay at the diner. And then I drove up here,

763
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:23,236
and I parked, and I waited. And then this car pulled up,

764
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:25,064
and she got out with him.

765
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:30,695
And, they went inside, and I watched them go.

766
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:32,998
And you're sure he's the owner of the socks?

767
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:36,066
Well, I didn't ask him, but he's the owner of the socks.

768
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:39,711
And if he isn't, the picture's still not looking very good.

769
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,088
I agree with you there.

770
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,022
Anyway, I sat here and watched them go inside.

771
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,156
I had all these thoughts rolling around in my head.

772
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,692
I mean, how could she do this, you know?

773
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:54,022
In there- in our house. I mean, I...

774
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:57,042
I put bookshelves up in there.

775
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:59,827
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think he's using your bookshelves.

776
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:03,217
I suddenly just got so mad, you know, I lost it.

777
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:08,168
I had to do something, so I got out and marched up to his car,

778
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:10,443
- and I kicked it. 
- You kicked his car?

779
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:13,525
Oh, hey, I kicked it hard and over and over and over again.

780
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:15,322
Oh, you beat up his car.

781
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:18,004
And then, all of a sudden, these cops pull up,

782
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,512
'cause some busybody in the neighborhood saw some lunatic attacking a car,

783
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:24,101
and, well, you know the rest.

784
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:25,382
Did Nicole see you?

785
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:29,402
I don't know. I don't know what she and the sock man saw. It's just...

786
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,504
God, I feel like such an idiot.

787
00:37:34,864 --> 00:37:38,982
I mean, suddenly I became like one of those guys that gets jealous

788
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,567
and, you know, does crazy things.

789
00:37:41,663 --> 00:37:44,715
Yeah, you weren't "like" one of those guys. You were one of those guys.

790
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:45,775
Yeah, well...

791
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,834
Was there any damage?

792
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:49,159
No.

793
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:52,754
Luke...

794
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,713
Hey, Luke, where are you going?

795
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:01,356
See? Nothing- not a scratch.

796
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:04,002
Those stupid dent-resistant panels.

797
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:06,583
- This is the car? 
- Yes, this is the car.

798
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:08,912
He sat there. She sat there.

799
00:38:09,015 --> 00:38:11,670
They got out there, walked up there. I jumped out there,

800
00:38:11,765 --> 00:38:14,433
ran up here, was handcuffed there, was driven off there.

801
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:17,489
I went to jail. And you drove all the way up here to get me...

802
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:20,064
- and they are still in there! 
- Oh, Luke.

803
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:22,645
I mean, I can't believe they're still in there. What are they doing?

804
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:23,515
Luke, come on.

805
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:25,691
I know what they're doing.

806
00:38:26,675 --> 00:38:29,516
But even if you took one of those pills that they were hawking at the super bowl,

807
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:32,511
you know, they should have been done in four or five hours, tops.

808
00:38:32,582 --> 00:38:35,219
I mean, that commercial said it all- "If you're still active after four hours,

809
00:38:35,337 --> 00:38:37,816
- you should call a damn doctor." 
- Come on, why don't we...

810
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:41,139
What are they, talking? Making plans in my house?

811
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:44,635
- Damn son of a... 
- Luke...

812
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:50,200
You lying piece of sockless garbage! Why don't you take home my socks, too?

813
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:53,631
Hey, hey! Luke- Luke, you were busted already once tonight -- that's it.

814
00:38:53,784 --> 00:38:54,851
All right, I'm fine. I'm fine.

815
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:56,329
- Are you sure? 
- Yeah.

816
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:58,823
Pretty soon, that car's gonna start fighting back.

817
00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:01,307
I'm fine... really. I'm fine.

818
00:39:03,693 --> 00:39:06,641
You know, Luke, I know I've never really been Miss "This-is-great"

819
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:11,055
about your relationship, but I am so, so sorry.

820
00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:15,439
You don't deserve this. You really don't deserve this.

821
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,111
I guess that's it.

822
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:26,881
At least I finally got to see your house.

823
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,853
- Whoo, fresh air is good. 
- Fresh air is healthy.

824
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:33,589
I'm feeling better.

825
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,220
- Gotta sit. 
- Me too.

826
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,717
- What was in the punch? Did we ask? 
- Nope.

827
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:42,610
- Should we have asked? 
- That's not what the cool kids do.

828
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:46,138
I'm loving the spinning beach. How about you?

829
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:47,889
Oh, yeah.

830
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:51,304
- So are we done? 
- With what?

831
00:39:51,816 --> 00:39:53,802
Spring break. Are we done?

832
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:54,924
I don't know.

833
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:57,924
Well, let's go down the list.

834
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,601
- Okay, we came. 
- Check.

835
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,639
- We danced. 
- Check.

836
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:04,642
- We drank. 
- Check.

837
00:40:04,794 --> 00:40:07,094
We... threw up.

838
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:08,394
We didn't throw up.

839
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:09,894
Give us 10 more minutes.

840
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,150
Right.

841
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,105
Basically, we're done.

842
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,232
I feel like we have officially participated.

843
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:19,208
We've experienced the entire social ritual.

844
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:22,822
I have absolutely no desire to ever feel this way again.

845
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,835
Let's go home.

846
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:27,834
How? We're supposed to stay the rest of the weekend.

847
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,663
Frequent-flyer miles, baby.

848
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,099
Cool peanuts. I'm in.

849
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:35,617
Great. I'll call as soon as I can get up.

850
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,770
What's that?

851
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:38,161
What?

852
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,390
Oh, my God!

853
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,230
Glenn! What happened to you?

854
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:50,066
The last time we saw you, you went to get a hot dog.

855
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,059
Hot dog?

856
00:40:52,939 --> 00:40:53,553
Hot dog.

857
00:40:54,874 --> 00:40:55,375
Hot dog.

858
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,953
You gotta admit, it's been a pretty good trip.

859
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:10,390
So I call this place where you were supposedly staying,

860
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,974
and some punk at the desk tells me...

861
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:13,066
I said I was sorry.

862
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,232
"I'm sorry, ma'am, she's not here anymore."

863
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:17,609
My heart flew out of my chest.

864
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,085
And not just because he called me "ma'am." Which by the way, I hate.

865
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:21,580
I didn't mean to freak you out.

866
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:23,996
You don't take off without telling Mommy.

867
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,460
I love that I didn't have to clear it with you to go on spring break,

868
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:27,970
but I had to clear it with you to come home.

869
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:31,237
I had visions of you being swallowed by a whale or taking off

870
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:34,544
with some surfers to go chase the perfect wave and not inviting me.

871
00:41:34,673 --> 00:41:36,259
It just got to be way too much fun.

872
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:37,862
Yeah? How much is "too much?"

873
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,603
- I had a drink. 
- And?

874
00:41:39,894 --> 00:41:41,472
Paris and I took turns throwing up.

875
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:43,749
That's the way you girls will find yourselves a husband.

876
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:47,507
It was fine- aspirin, tons of water, mac and cheese...

877
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:50,544
Ahh, my baby's discovered her first hangover food.

878
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,821
I wish I had a picture to put next to your clay handprint.

879
00:41:53,939 --> 00:41:55,270
I think I still have the box.

880
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:56,852
Send it to me. So how was it?

881
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,052
It was interesting, you know? We sat on the beach, went to a club,

882
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:02,013
we watched "The Power of Myth," Paris and I kissed...

883
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,080
You watched "The Power of Myth"?

884
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:07,189
- Hold on a sec. 
- I hid that from you!

885
00:42:08,418 --> 00:42:10,984
- Hello? 
- Hey, Rory, it's me.

886
00:42:11,454 --> 00:42:14,890
Hi, Dean. Hold on a sec.

887
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:16,918
Mom, I have to call you back.

888
00:42:17,196 --> 00:42:19,129
You did not spend spring break with Bill Moyers.

889
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:19,954
Bye.

890
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:21,531
Hi.

891
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,839
So, I got your message.

892
00:42:24,382 --> 00:42:25,371
- Oh, yeah? 
- Yeah.

893
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:28,325
It sounds like you were, uh, having a pretty good time out there.

894
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:32,048
And I got a lot of questions. I even wrote a couple down. Are you ready?

895
