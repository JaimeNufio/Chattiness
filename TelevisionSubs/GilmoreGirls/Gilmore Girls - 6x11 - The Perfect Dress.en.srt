1
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:20,530
What in the hell do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:21,660
I was just getting some coffee.

3
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:22,826
You came behind my counter.

4
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:24,318
I saw Lorelai do it the other day.

5
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,698
Lorelai is my fiancé.

6
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:28,449
So only people you're sleeping with
are allowed behind the counter?

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,372
Yes.

8
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,077
Well, I don't really know
you that well, Luke.

9
00:00:32,163 --> 00:00:34,865
I mean, I know what you do for a living,
and I know you're a scorpio,

10
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:38,402
and you smell okay, but we've never
really connected on a deeper level.

11
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:39,991
Get out from behind my counter, Kirk.

12
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,906
Well, now it's a definite no.

13
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,923
Oh, my god. Look who's back.

14
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:49,220
Well, I believe it's those
adorable Gilmore girls.

15
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:50,585
My, how we have missed them.

16
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,581
I hear they're different now-- a little sad.

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,225
A little broke.

18
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:54,600
Don't you two believe in jet lag?

19
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,221
No way.
We're still flying on the Atlantic City buzz.

20
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,458
Hey, handsome. Were you bad while I was gone?

21
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:01,921
I was. I went to bed every night at 10:15.

22
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:03,493
Grandpa, what am I gonna do with you?

23
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:05,033
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey, Rory.

24
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:08,253
We, on the other hand,
have not been to bed at all since we left.

25
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:09,362
We did fall over once, though.

26
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:10,219
Did you have a good trip?

27
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,542
I believe it was the best belated
21st-birthday party on record.

28
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:16,378
What's different?

29
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:17,210
No kalua.

30
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:18,158
Oh, right.

31
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,478
Which reminds me-- sorry about all the
drunken late-night phone calls.

32
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,257
What drunken late-night phone calls?

33
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,199
Uh, so, um, do you want to hear about all the
things we can tell you about our trip?

34
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:29,193
I'm not sure.

35
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:33,554
First of all, video poker is my
calling. I think I'm totally
gonna dedicate my life to it,

36
00:01:33,647 --> 00:01:36,771
especially the third machine in
the second row of machines

37
00:01:36,854 --> 00:01:39,342
as you hit the entrance of trump Taj Mahal.

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,336
I'm more of a roulette girl myself.

39
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:44,560
And we did the whole thing up right.
We did the martinis at the blackjack table.

40
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:47,428
And we pretended I was turning
21 while we were playing 21.

41
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:50,621
And we actually won and bought our 21 items.

42
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:53,890
Shot glasses, glow-in-the-dark coasters,
salt and pepper shakers, pasties.

43
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:54,757
Oh, and look.

44
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:55,461
What's that?

45
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:56,554
21 guys' phone numbers.

46
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:59,222
I must say I'm pretty proud of how quickly
we got them and also of the fact

47
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,226
that no one questioned us when we said
our names were Wendy and Lisa.

48
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:05,419
So, tell me, how was Paul Anka-- the person,
not the dog?

49
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:06,367
We didn't get to see him.

50
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:07,604
Why not? It's all you talked about.

51
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:10,462
His show had actually closed
a week before we got there.

52
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:11,566
So, who'd you end up seeing?

53
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:14,402
Well, it came down to journey without
their original lead singer,

54
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,425
INXS without their original lead singer,

55
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:18,445
Queen without their original lead singer,

56
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:21,180
the Suprem without Diana, and, weirdly,

57
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:23,322
the James Brown band without James Brown.

58
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,600
But we wound up seeing Tony Danza,
who was sublime.

59
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,285
Oh, the tap dancing.

60
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:30,928
Why "Taxi" never utilized his musical-comedy
skills is astonishing.

61
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,597
Sounds great.

62
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:34,409
Oh, and we snagged you a Paul Anka t-shirt.

63
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,590
Had some left over.

64
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,225
Wear it tonight.

65
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,241
Okay.

66
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,731
I'm making you burgers.

67
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:41,405
Wait, wait.
You haven't seen the best part yet.

68
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:41,943
What?

69
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,169
We were walking...

70
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:47,106
Well, sort of walking,
sort of drunk girls in high heels stumbling.

71
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,538
...down the street, and we see this guy.

72
00:02:48,622 --> 00:02:50,623
And, Luke, my hand to god, it's you.

73
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,735
It's totally you. Luke 2.0.

74
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:55,197
We came face-to-face with your doppelganger,
my friend.

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,846
So we followed him.

76
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:58,631
Yeah, 'cause we had to.
He went into this nightclub,
so we followed him.

77
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:01,014
'Cause we're stalkers obsessed
with getting his picture.

78
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,608
We follow him through this grungy place.
He goes backstage.

79
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:05,468
'Cause he's in the biz.

80
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,328
We sneak behind the curtain,
and we track him down.

81
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:11,017
We told him all about you,
and then I showed him your picture,
and he totally freaked out.

82
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,049
Wait, I got it.

83
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:17,004
Luke, I want you to meet Derek McKinney,
your twin separated at birth.

84
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,911
This is a man dressed like Dolly Parton.

85
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:21,313
You should hear him do "Jolene"-- amazing.

86
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,421
You think I look like a guy
dressed as Dolly Parton?

87
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:26,123
A little less with the makeup,
but check out the chins.

88
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:28,324
I'm gonna get your burgers.

89
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:31,681
He missed us.

90
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,625
Definitely.

91
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,244
Mom, I got to go!

92
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,903
Hold on. Wait. I'm coming.

93
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,673
Here's sustenance for the road.

94
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:36,583
For the very long 30-minute
drive back to school?

95
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:38,666
Thank god.
I don't think I would have made it.

96
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:39,554
Do you have everything?

97
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,670
I think so.

98
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:42,147
Oh, no!

99
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:44,156
What? What are you doing?
Why do you hate the boxes?

100
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,256
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

101
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:49,967
I accidentally forgot to turn
in my community-service vest.

102
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:50,660
So?

103
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,785
So this vest belongs to the state.

104
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:55,744
I have now stolen state property.

105
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:58,780
They're gonna give me community service
for stealing my community-service vest.

106
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:03,011
Okay, freaky, then hand me the vest.
I will deliver it to the state, okay?

107
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:04,256
What's next on your agenda?

108
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,163
I'm just gonna head straight
over to Paris' apartment.

109
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:09,067
I can't believe you're gonna live
with Paris again-- again.

110
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,266
Hey, she's got an empty room,
and the price is right.

111
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:14,420
The housing on campus is taken,
so it's that or a cardboard box.

112
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:16,016
Okay, but how big a cardboard box?

113
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,229
After I dump my stuff at Paris',
I have to hit campus.

114
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:21,251
I still have some class begging to do.
I have to add two courses to my schedule

115
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:23,092
if I'm gonna make up all the
work I've missed this year.

116
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:24,836
You don't have to make up
everything right away.

117
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,601
I do if I want to graduate the same time
I would have before the detour.

118
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:30,343
Anyway, I have tons of books to buy.
I have a meeting with the dean.

119
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:33,548
And, of course, I have a meeting
with the school psychologist.

120
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,192
Back up. I'm sorry. You-- a meeting with who?

121
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:37,175
I told you about this.

122
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:38,191
No, you did not.

123
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,843
Every student who unexpectedly takes
time off and wants to come back

124
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:43,117
has to have a one-time meeting
with the school psychologist.

125
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:44,858
- You did not tell me this.
- I did.

126
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,333
You did not, because I would have
remembered if you told me

127
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,482
you had to have your head shrunk.

128
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:52,115
It's just a formality. They just want to make
sure I'm stable and everything's cool.

129
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,814
I can't believe you're going to a therapist.

130
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:55,882
You know,
they're totally gonna ask you about me.

131
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:56,267
What?

132
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,908
They always want to ask about your mother.

133
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:59,079
It's okay. Say whatever you want.

134
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:02,362
But make sure you start with,
"my mother's very hot."

135
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,053
Yes, that won't seem at all
disturbing to the doctor.

136
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:06,519
- I have to get going.
- I don't want you to go.

137
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:08,223
- Mom...
- You just got here.

138
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,280
But you're gonna come see me in three days.

139
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:13,402
I know, but with our stupid fight,
I got cheated this year.

140
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:15,144
I know. Me too.

141
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,252
Okay.

142
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:20,272
All right. That's enough affection for you.

143
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,919
Paul Anka, come say goodbye.

144
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:23,373
I haven't seen him all morning.

145
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,425
Paul Anka!

146
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,427
Oh, well,
I guess he doesn't like you better than me.

147
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:28,532
A fickle pooch, that one.

148
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:30,081
Well, he knows who pours the kibble.

149
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:31,830
Say goodbye to him for me,
and I'll call you tonight.

150
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,167
Okay. Bye.

151
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:34,441
- Hey!
- What?

152
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,467
He does like me better!

153
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:38,458
Oh, you put bacon in your laundry.

154
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,863
Paul Anka likes me better.
Paul Anka likes me better.

155
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:45,060
First Tony Danza tosses you the corsage,
and now this. Get out here, you.

156
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,400
Yeah. That's right.
Avoid my glance there, buddy.

157
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:49,240
It's the sugar-on-the-toe thing.

158
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:50,974
A dog never forgets his first sugar toe.

159
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,680
I thought you had a million
things to do today.

160
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:54,798
Hmm. Suddenly not so sad to see me go, huh?

161
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,771
What? No. Don't be a stranger. Bye-bye.

162
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:58,191
Bye, Paul Anka.

163
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:01,153
If you squint really hard,
she kind of looks like me.

164
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:02,231
Take off, lady.

165
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,208
Hey, Judas, get back here right now!

166
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,271
So, what are your initial thoughts
about your wedding?

167
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,028
Well, it should be legal.

168
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:20,301
Good. Okay. And after that?

169
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,470
After that, I'm out.

170
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,881
How about a hometown wedding?

171
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,978
Town square-- ceremony in the gazebo.

172
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:26,932
Gaze-blah.

173
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:28,942
Okay. Boring. I got it.

174
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:30,011
How about a church wedding?

175
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:30,602
Maybe.

176
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:32,242
Ooh, a beach wedding, huh?

177
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:34,245
No shoes, Luke can wear shorts.

178
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:36,974
No. But I want to be with you when
you pitch the shorts idea to Luke.

179
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:40,594
Okay, no consensus on the locale.
Let's move on to the dress.

180
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:41,418
Okay.

181
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,467
Any thoughts?

182
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:43,739
There should be one.

183
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:45,856
Okay. Doing great here.

184
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,269
Are you gonna eat that cake?

185
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:49,169
Why, you want it?

186
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:51,843
It's just sitting there.
It doesn't look like you're gonna eat it.

187
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:54,236
Oh. Oh, my god. You want our table,
don't you?

188
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:55,085
Yeah, we're swamped.

189
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,006
Luke, I'm your fiancé.
That doesn't buy me extra table time?

190
00:07:58,105 --> 00:07:59,500
You've been sitting there for two hours.

191
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:00,534
We're planning our wedding.

192
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:01,793
Well, plan at the counter.

193
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:03,850
You want a counter-planned
wedding, seriously?

194
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:04,639
Coming right up.

195
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,468
Forget I said anything.

196
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:07,125
Yeah.

197
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:08,766
Hey, that's a pretty dress.

198
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:10,399
Maybe. It's very white.

199
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:11,282
You don't want to wear white?

200
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:12,479
Maybe. I'm not sure.

201
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:13,722
Of course you're gonna wear white.

202
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:15,687
Brides wear white. That's the rule.

203
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,426
Says who?

204
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,862
Y-you have to wear white.
My mother wore white. Her mother wore white.

205
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,047
Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke!

206
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:23,295
Do you know who I am?

207
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,239
Of course I know who you are.

208
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:25,367
Who am I, Luke?

209
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:26,168
You're Sookie.

210
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:28,295
No, Luke. I'm not "Sookie."

211
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:30,172
I'm "Sookie B.F.O.T.B."

212
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:30,723
What?

213
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,409
Best Friend Of The Bride.

214
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:35,320
It is my responsibility to
help plan this event,

215
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:39,546
to talk through all the details,
to taste the cake and pick the invitations,

216
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:42,450
and to keep you-- the fiancé of the bride--

217
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,447
from having to pretend to be interested
in things that he has no interest in.

218
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:50,319
- I have an interest.
- B.F.O.T.B.

219
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:51,982
Your turkey melt is up.

220
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:54,237
- Luke, your turkey melt's up.
- Fine.

221
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,599
- Refills?
- Yes. See, I can make decisions.

222
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:57,383
What's all this?

223
00:08:57,489 --> 00:08:58,654
We are planning a wedding.

224
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:01,145
Oh, super. Well, at least there'll be cake.

225
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:05,379
Well, it's nice that my outlook on life
is sunnier than a 21-year-old's.

226
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:08,604
Okay, let's start with something
simple-- a date for the wedding.

227
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:09,792
Okay, that does sound simple.

228
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,539
Some people have mentioned some conflicts,

229
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,419
and I think we should take
those into consideration.

230
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:14,121
Okay.

231
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:17,014
Miss Patty is going to be in Baja
the first two weeks in April.

232
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:21,029
And Babette said the last two weeks in April
are bad because her cat's expecting kittens.

233
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:22,080
That little tramp.

234
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:24,657
Michel's bad every Saturday
from now until February

235
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,992
because he signed up for his
booty boot camp again.

236
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:30,465
Kirk has no conflicts,
but Lulu is going to Florida sometime

237
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:33,272
between may 15th and June 1st.

238
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:34,536
Who's Lulu?

239
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,351
Kirk's girlfriend.

240
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:38,887
We're not moving wedding plans around for
people whose last names I don't even know.

241
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:39,901
- Luke!
- What?

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,119
- Who am I?
- Oh, jeez.

243
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:45,971
Apartment 5 is Mrs. Holiday. She steals mail.

244
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:49,550
Apartment 6 is the chili cheese boys.
Take the description at face value.

245
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:53,801
I don't know who's in apartment 7 because
meeting 5 and 6 was enough
"it takes a village" for me.

246
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,340
Here we are-- apartment 8.

247
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:56,276
8 is great.

248
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:59,547
Okay, now,
you have to unlock the middle bolt first...

249
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,484
the bottom bolt second...

250
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:05,847
the top lock third...

251
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,877
the bottom lock fourth.

252
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,668
You got to kick the door twice.

253
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:11,770
And that's it.

254
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,161
Wow, you really have to earn it, huh?

255
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:15,510
It's just a precaution.
It isn't really necessary.

256
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:17,728
This neighborhood is only
as scary as you make it.

257
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,982
Those guys downstairs-- they
just look deadly.

258
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:22,251
Believe me, they don't bother
you if you don't bother them.

259
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:25,118
When you have guests over,
just tell them they're a doo-wop group.

260
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:31,349
We keep the door fully locked,
even when we're home.

261
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:34,159
We actually added the chains after there were
a couple of break-ins on the street,

262
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,610
but we've never had any trouble.

263
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,217
We've got a very sophisticated
crime-prevention system set up here.

264
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,582
When we leave, we always keep the radio on--

265
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,952
rush Limbaugh, of course,
so they know we have guns in the house.

266
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:46,637
The lights are all on a timer,
so don't touch the switches.

267
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:50,285
And there's a motion detector in the hallway,
so don't freak out when it goes on at night.

268
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:53,171
Now, over here is our trusty
dog-- bloodhound.

269
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:57,165
Excellent for magazine pushers and
pamphlet bearers of all types.

270
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,970
- You've got it all covered.
- Pretty much.

271
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:01,682
That's our room. That's your room.
They're both the same size,

272
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,581
but we have an extra window 'cause Doyle has
dreams about walls collapsing in on him,

273
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,479
so he needs to sleep near glass.

274
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,527
Oh, my god! Were those gunshots?

275
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:11,509
No, that was just a car backfiring.

276
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:13,337
The real gunfire actually sounds fake.

277
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,432
You'll pick it up eventually.
They call it "ghetto ear."

278
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:16,700
Something to look forward to.

279
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:19,477
Doyle sleeps very deeply,
so don't worry about the hours.

280
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:21,830
I, as you know, haven't slept through
the night since the first time

281
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,658
I saw "The Wizard of Oz," thank you mom,

282
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,550
so I tend to do my crafts in
the middle of the night.

283
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:27,899
But the walls are very thick.
You won't hear a thing.

284
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,303
Oh, now, the hot water in the bathroom--

285
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:38,312
Aha! You let your guard down, Geller,
and I did it. I got the best of you.

286
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,092
- I was giving a tour!
- Admit your defeat!

287
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:42,101
- Never. Rematch.
- Challenge accepted.

288
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:42,832
Helmets on.

289
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:44,549
What are you doing? What's going on?

290
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,399
When we moved into the neighborhood,
we thought it would be good

291
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,359
to take some self-defense classes.

292
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:51,932
Krav maga-- official self-defense,
hand-to-hand combat style of Israel.

293
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,934
Krav maga is not about being a tough
guy or fighting in a ring.

294
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:58,448
It's about going home alive, no matter what.

295
00:11:58,539 --> 00:11:59,360
And it's a rush.

296
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,333
Pads on.

297
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:02,488
Attack on 3.

298
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,369
1... 2...

299
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:09,737
Okay, I'm gonna go get the rest of my stuff,
so I'm just gonna...

300
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:12,902
Steinbeck! Steinbeck!

301
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,265
That's not your safety word.

302
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,001
I know. It's "saroyan."

303
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:20,339
You've been practicing behind my back.

304
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:21,319
I love you.

305
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:26,930
3418. 3418. Did we pass 3418?

306
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,244
This is some weak coffee.

307
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,327
Maybe I wrote it down wrong.
"Across the street from a butcher."

308
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:32,431
Or a "Barber."

309
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:33,727
Or a "Barbara."

310
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:34,877
"Across the street from a Barbara."

311
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:38,268
Ooh, I wonder if it's a famous Barbara,
like Streisand or Mandrell.

312
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,283
Okay, I give.

313
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,293
Oh, I think we passed it.

314
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:43,675
This was supposed to be the best place
to find wedding invitations,

315
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,214
and now we've passed it!

316
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,616
And since we passed it,
it's vanished from the face of the earth,
never to be seen again.

317
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:49,813
Here. Let me see the paper.

318
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:52,542
Oh, yeah, we passed it.

319
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:53,848
Of course we have.

320
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,417
And we're on the wrong side of the street.

321
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:56,513
Of course we are.

322
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:58,596
Ooh! Look, look.

323
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:00,154
What? Oh jeez.

324
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:01,981
- Let's go in.
- Why?

325
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:03,301
To look at dresses!

326
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:06,277
Oh Sookie,
I don't know what kind of dress I want.
I may make my own dress.

327
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,497
So what? We can just go in and look around.

328
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:09,792
They're gonna look at us funny.

329
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,014
What are you talking about?

330
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:12,690
You have the golden ticket...

331
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:13,928
I do, don't I?

332
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:16,588
You have the golden ticket on your hand...

333
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:18,485
You're gonna stop singing
when we go inside, right?

334
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:20,127
Otherwise, they really will look at us funny.

335
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,525
Wow. It's a lot of white.

336
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,215
Ooh! Try this on. I dare you.

337
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:29,514
I think this is the one divine turned
down for being too over-the-top.

338
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:30,897
Are we allowed to touch these?

339
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:32,458
I don't know. Do you see anyone here?

340
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,096
No.

341
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:36,826
Maybe they're in back. Maybe they've
been taken hostage by the tulle.

342
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:39,501
Where are you going?

343
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,813
What are you doing?

344
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:42,631
Look.

345
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:43,706
Pretty.

346
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:47,488
Not pretty. It's perfect.
It's the perfect dress.

347
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,075
Really? You think?

348
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:53,171
I don't believe it. I just turned around,
and there it is-- the perfect dress.

349
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:54,531
It's your size.

350
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:57,083
The perfect dress is my size. That is weird.

351
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,470
Does anyone work here?

352
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,364
Hello! Does anyone work here?!

353
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:01,677
- Oh, my god.
- What?

354
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,907
It's on sale.

355
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,618
It's the perfect dress.

356
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:06,683
That's it. I'm trying it on.

357
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:13,395
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not looking for anything serious.

358
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:21,473
Look. Woman come in here.
Tell me this is full set of 1950s milk glass.

359
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:23,984
Does she think my mother dropped
me on my head when I'm a baby?

360
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,500
I know Nigella Lawson when I see it.

361
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:27,731
I'm going upstairs.

362
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:29,926
Wait. Talk.

363
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,277
How was work?

364
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:34,558
I handed people food for 6 1/2 hours.
It's every little girl's dream.

365
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:36,493
I'm making kimchi dumplings tonight.

366
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,171
I smell like burgers and fries,
so I'll have to shower.

367
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,859
Okay.

368
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,576
Which means I won't be ready for
dinner for at least 45 minutes.

369
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,533
Fine. I need to make the dumplings.
Dumplings don't' make themselves.

370
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:47,283
And you might want to put on
your Korean television show.

371
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:50,637
Because I'm gonna listen to music-- and it's
gonna be music you don't approve of.

372
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:54,343
But I'm 21 now, so I'll listen to the
music that I like when I like,

373
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:56,038
and that's just the way it's gonna be.

374
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,865
Professor Jillian. Professor Jillian!

375
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:04,269
Sorry. I'm in a bit of a hurry.

376
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,114
That's okay. Don't slow down. I'll catch up.

377
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,168
Hi. Rory Gilmore.

378
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:08,128
Nice to meet you, Rory.

379
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:11,115
And you, really. I'm actually hoping
to get a spot in your class.

380
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:13,703
It was full by the time I got my name in,
not that my delay in registering

381
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,183
should be taken as lack of enthusiasm.

382
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,322
Apparently not.

383
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,510
So, anyhow, I'm really hoping to
score a spot in your class.

384
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:20,956
Well, add/drop begins tomorrow.

385
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,879
I'm aware of that. I thought I would start
putting in a good word for myself now.

386
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:27,604
So here's the good word,
I'm dying to be in your class.

387
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,220
I even bought your book,
the one you wrote for the class.

388
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:32,967
I bought it new, not used,
so you get full royalty payment on it.

389
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:33,784
Well, thank you.

390
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:34,893
I want to be in your class.

391
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:37,920
I can't make you any promises,
but I appreciate your enthusiasm.

392
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,985
And by the way, I get full royalties whether
you buy the book new or used.

393
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,493
See how much I've learned already?

394
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:43,322
Goodbye, Rory.

395
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:44,537
I will see you tomorrow.

396
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,729
I knew you'd have to hit the
coffee cart eventually.

397
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,183
Well, we're done.

398
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:10,057
We're done with what?

399
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:12,114
With the wedding preparations.
We're all done.

400
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,097
What?

401
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:15,210
I just dropped off a deposit
check to the caterer,

402
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:18,053
and I brought you some duck-sausage rolls,
by the way.

403
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:19,034
Duck-sausage rolls.

404
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:21,303
They sounded weird to me, too,
but they're incredible.

405
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,168
I don't understand. How did this happen?

406
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,886
This morning, you didn't know whether you
were gonna wear a white dress or not.

407
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:29,291
I know, but then Sookie and I went
to check out these invitations,

408
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:31,652
and right next door,
there was this little bridal shop.

409
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:36,269
And we thought, "we'll just go in,
look around,
no big deal." Just girl fun, right?

410
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,710
And I went in, and I turned around,
and there it was-- the perfect dress.

411
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:45,089
The bodice is this blush-colored silk
tulle, and it has all these
little crystal beads on it.

412
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:51,098
The skirt is a blush silk tulle
with a blush silk/satin lining,
and the back goes into a train.

413
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:55,649
And, oh, it has a cream, satin sash,
so you get a little white in there,

414
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,260
which I know is very important to you.

415
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,012
I tried it on, and it fit me perfectly,
and it was on sale, and so I bought it.

416
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:04,655
And from the minute I bought the dress,
everything else fell into place.

417
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:05,774
What does that mean?

418
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:08,078
Well, the dress is strapless, so, hello,
summer wedding.

419
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,323
And summer means daisies,
so flower choice done.

420
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:14,475
And we went into the stationery store,
and there was the perfect daisy invitations,

421
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:19,153
which I know sounds a little girly,
but, seriously, there are
no macho wedding invitations,

422
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,665
so please just give me this one, okay?

423
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,387
Okay.

424
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,937
Okay. So I bought the invitations.
The place is running a special.

425
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:28,818
They print the invites and mail them for you
and handle the RSVP list, so that's done.

426
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:31,672
Then we go to get some coffee,
and in the window of the coffee shop,

427
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:35,014
there is a picture of a beautiful
rose-covered church.

428
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:37,612
I thought, "gee, that's pretty.
I wonder where that is."

429
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,089
And do you know where it is?

430
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:39,839
No.

431
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:43,144
Right around the corner from the coffee shop.
So we went in and talked to pastor Todd.

432
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,472
Pastor Todd?

433
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:47,225
And the church is perfect. And out back,
there's a separate function hall

434
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:50,282
with these floor-to-ceiling windows
and doors that open out.

435
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:53,111
And behind the hall is this old carousel.

436
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,125
- A carousel?
- From 1850.

437
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:57,553
And it should be fully restored
and working by June 3rd,

438
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:59,016
which, by the way,
is the date of our wedding.

439
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,328
- June 3rd?
- Yes.

440
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:05,493
Which is also miraculously a date that
absolutely no one in stars
hollow has a conflict with,

441
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,279
and the pastor was running a special.

442
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,577
- A special?
- Yeah.

443
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,534
I rented the church.
And he gave me the hall for half price,

444
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,949
and he threw in the use of
the carousel for nothing.

445
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,673
And his sister runs a catering company,
and Sookie blessed it,

446
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,253
and so basically that's it-- we're done.

447
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:20,577
It was so weird how this happened.

448
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,250
It's like the dress was a sign or something.

449
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:24,541
There are no signs.

450
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:27,423
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! It started snowing.

451
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:30,547
It started snowing right as I
started talking about signs.

452
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,292
That, my friend, is a sign.

453
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:34,706
That is not a sign. That is weather.

454
00:18:34,837 --> 00:18:36,819
No, this is more than weather.

455
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:38,001
This is fate.

456
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:39,418
June 3rd, huh?

457
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,883
- June 3rd.
- That's soon.

458
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:41,578
I know.

459
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,021
It's less than five months away.

460
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,014
I know.

461
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:48,681
Okay, I better get this back home
before the snow gets any worse.

462
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,531
Oh, and I picked out your tuxedo.

463
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,290
You can stop by the place anytime you want.

464
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:55,766
They were running a special,
so the alterations are free.

465
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:10,103
City beat-- Martha Billings.
Editorials-- Peter Brooke.

466
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:14,333
Sports-- Russ Tamblen.
Religion beat-- Heather Torrance.

467
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:16,567
Religion beat-- my former beat.

468
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:17,736
Good luck, Heather.

469
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:22,237
And features-- Arlen Sather, Nick Scott,
and the returning Rory Gilmore.

470
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,335
Also joining our ranks this year,
our former editor Doyle McMaster

471
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,953
and his his new column "the
world according to Doyle."

472
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:30,647
It's going to be a great term, people,
an important term,

473
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:34,059
a term to change the history
of the Yale Daily News.

474
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:36,286
The work will be hard. It has to be hard.

475
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,243
Nothing less than perfect will be tolerated.

476
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:41,764
Please remember that I am your editor.

477
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:43,893
I am not your mother or your hugger.

478
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,703
If you need some love, get a hooker.

479
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:48,308
If you're having a bad day,
find a ledge or a way to deal.

480
00:19:48,414 --> 00:19:51,560
My door is not open to you ever.

481
00:19:51,952 --> 00:19:54,084
You have five minutes to enjoy your cookies.

482
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,256
Welcome to the Yale Daily News.

483
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,510
Thanks for the features beat, Paris.

484
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,659
You deserve it. You're a good writer.

485
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:03,575
Thank you.
And I know you're gonna be a great editor.

486
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:04,723
- I plan on it.
- Yeah.

487
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:07,344
But, you know,
you might want to ease up just a tad.

488
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,219
What do you mean?

489
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:11,915
You know, the "five minutes for the cookies,"
the "no talking" signs posted everywhere,

490
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,753
the "no decorating your desk" rule,
the new demerit system,

491
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,361
the locks on theathroom doors.
It's just all a little, um,
harsh and restrictive.

492
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:24,058
This is a newsroom.
People should be able to talk, yell,
joke around...

493
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:24,693
I don't agree.

494
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:25,494
...Go to the bathroom.

495
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:29,779
Journalism is an art form,
and the best art is created under repression,
like Stalin's gulag.

496
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,512
You think Solzhenitsyn could have written

497
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,394
"one day in the life of Ivan Denisovich"
on a yoga retreat?

498
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,577
- Paris, I don't really think...
- Oh, great.

499
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:39,106
I got a call saying your boyfriend
was coming back.

500
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:41,982
He's not my boyfriend anymore, Paris.
We broke up.

501
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:45,260
Keep your personal stuff at home, okay?
I can't be seen caring about this.

502
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:46,534
My door is not open!

503
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:48,658
Huntzberger-- my office, now!

504
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:57,396
Sit down, Logan.
Let's have a little talk about your future.

505
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:58,851
Sure, Paris.

506
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:03,915
Now, I know you think your sugar daddy runs
the world, and that includes this paper,

507
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:06,945
and possibly in the past that was true,
but not anymore.

508
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:08,114
You don't scare me.

509
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,661
Your daddy doesn't scare me.

510
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:10,932
Your mommy doesn't scare me.

511
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:14,997
If you have a brother, a sister,
or a really angry cat,
they don't scare me, either.

512
00:21:15,096 --> 00:21:19,037
Hey, either spin a plate on your
nose while you do that or cut
it out, 'cause I am speaking.

513
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:20,404
- Sorry.
- Oh, you will be.

514
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:23,768
Now let's talk about deadlines,
emphasis on "dead."

515
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,140
So, the elevator's getting fixed on Monday,

516
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:30,495
but I'm thinking I may not even use it 'cause
the stairs are excellent exercise.

517
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:32,319
And I love having a hallway, you know.

518
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:34,329
I've never had a hallway before.

519
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:39,642
And I am really lucky that Paris and Doyle
hadn't rented out that other room yet.

520
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:42,493
I mean, this location is really in demand.

521
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,077
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

522
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,841
I mean,
it is literally 10 minutes from campus.

523
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,328
You know how hard I'm gonna have
to work to be late for class?

524
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,169
Those guys down there-- are
they your neighbors?

525
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,671
Um, no. They're a doo-wop group.

526
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,301
You have some plutonium back
there or something?

527
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:00,782
Uh, no, just Paris. She's quirky.

528
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:02,694
Okay, welcome to my place.

529
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:04,695
No.

530
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,480
- Mom, give it a chance.
- No.

531
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:08,837
Look, we have a really big living room.

532
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,498
No.

533
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:13,396
I know it just looks rundown,
but everything works fine.

534
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:14,213
No!

535
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:15,445
- Mom.
- No.

536
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:17,650
Okay, tour's over. Time for lunch.

537
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:18,655
No.

538
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,578
Let's go.

539
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,059
No. No.

540
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,168
Saroyan! Saroyan!

541
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:27,220
- No, no, no.
- Okay. Okay.

542
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:30,903
It's very nice.

543
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:31,853
It's one of a kind.

544
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:33,273
- Will you take $250?
- For that chair?

545
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:34,482
It does have some nicks.

546
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,265
That chair is 200 years old.
It's gonna have some nicks.

547
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:39,329
It sat in James Madison's bedroom.

548
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:42,147
This chair is a piece of history. We
shouldn't even be allowed to sell it to you.

549
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,774
Well, I didn't mean to insult you.

550
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:45,047
You didn't insult me.

551
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,890
You insulted the chair and the
United States of America.

552
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,477
All right. $300's fine.

553
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:50,156
Forget it.

554
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,518
That's what the price tag says.

555
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,605
The price just went up.
If you want the chair, it's $350.

556
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:57,058
If you don't, please leave,
because I have a lot of work to do.

557
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:57,911
- Well...
- Bye.

558
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,559
$350-- here.

559
00:22:59,732 --> 00:23:00,792
Do you take cash?

560
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:02,103
Exact change only.

561
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,463
I don't suppose you have a delivery service.

562
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,243
Oh, that's okay.
I'll-- I'll take it with me right now.

563
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,107
You forgot to kick her in the
pants as she walked out.

564
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:15,271
I made the sale, didn't I?

565
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,675
Yes, but with less bite,
a customer might come back.

566
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:18,926
You always drive a hard bargain.

567
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:19,959
- Yes, I do.
- Okay, then.

568
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:22,344
- We do have a delivery service.
- Yeah, me in a minivan--

569
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:25,336
not in the mood, no matter how exciting
the prospect of a $2 tip is.

570
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:26,469
Too bad it's not Christmas--

571
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:30,417
that smiley face of yours would cheer
up children for miles around.

572
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:34,023
Zach. Zack!

573
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,823
You have a lot of nerve just to
walk into my place like this.

574
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:39,350
What are you talking about?
This is like a place of business.

575
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,766
Maybe I want to buy some antiques.

576
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:41,932
Oh, right!

577
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,763
You're not wearing your glasses anymore.

578
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:44,844
What do you want, Zach?

579
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,290
I think you have a CD of mine.

580
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,958
What CD?

581
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:49,036
The one with a crazy-looking chick on it.

582
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,066
I don't have any of your CDs, Zach.

583
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:52,796
I think you do.
I can go up to your room and check.

584
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:55,789
No!
Zach, you can't go up to my room and check.

585
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:59,215
I look and if I find a CD with
a crazy-looking chick on
it, I'll mail it to you.

586
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,698
Seriously, let's go upstairs and look now.

587
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:02,828
I'm working, Zach.

588
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,906
Yeah, I can tell there's a major
rush on ancient crap going on.

589
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,025
Bye, Zach!

590
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:08,124
Five minutes, Lane.

591
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:08,880
Out, Zach!

592
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:10,749
- It's my favorite CD.
- Out!

593
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:11,609
Fine!

594
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:15,672
Hey, you break it, you buy it!

595
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:17,644
Oh, Rory.

596
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:19,064
Come on. It's not so bad.

597
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,246
It's "Angela's Ashes."

598
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:21,118
It's basic.

599
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:22,199
It's "Sanford and Son."

600
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,198
Mom, the neighborhood is safe.
A ton of kids from school live there.

601
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:27,423
And they have a safety van that
goes to and from campus,

602
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:29,046
so I don't have to walk home at night.

603
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:30,492
That wasn't a doo-wop group, was it?

604
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:31,266
No.

605
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:34,064
Let's call daddy,
make him pay for an apartment with one lock.

606
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:36,502
No.
Look, this is the way it's supposed to be.

607
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:38,243
I am in college. Don't you see?

608
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:40,479
I'm supposed to live in a crappy apartment.

609
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:44,809
I'm supposed to eat ramen noodles
and mac and cheese for months.

610
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:47,582
I've been living in a pool house with maids

611
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:50,259
and fresh-cut flowers and mints
on my pillow every night.

612
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:51,780
You got to love my mother sometimes.

613
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:56,291
This is good and right, and I'm happy,
and I have roommates who
are learning to kill people.

614
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:59,837
So where's the bad? Now let's talk about you.
How are the wedding plans going?

615
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,844
- Done.
- What?

616
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,106
- All done.
- What?

617
00:25:02,243 --> 00:25:04,914
The dress, the cake, the place,
the invitations. June 3rd, by the way.

618
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:05,732
Wow.

619
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:07,829
Yeah. I also bought your dress and shoes.

620
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,055
How did all this happen?

621
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,912
Well, I found this dress, which, at the time,
seemed like the perfect dress.

622
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,270
And from the dress,
all the other details fell into place.
By the end of the day, it was done.

623
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:17,718
- That's great.
- Is it?

624
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:19,450
- Isn't it?
- I don't know.

625
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:23,254
Sure, I thought it was. I thought it was
a sign or something-- finding the dress.

626
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,228
Then when it started to snow, I was like,
"somebody's telling me something."

627
00:25:27,314 --> 00:25:28,437
So it would seem.

628
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:29,862
Then I started thinking.

629
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:30,401
Uh-oh.

630
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:31,611
It was all too easy.

631
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,399
Planning a wedding shouldn't be easy
because marriage isn't easy.

632
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:35,934
How do you know? You've never been married.

633
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:37,514
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

634
00:25:37,606 --> 00:25:39,248
I have never been married
because it's not easy,

635
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:41,507
and I usually freak out and
screw everything up.

636
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:43,485
I freaked out and screwed everything
up with Max, remember?

637
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:46,156
- Yeah, but...
- But I haven't freaked out about Luke yet.

638
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:47,448
Why haven't I freaked out about Luke yet?

639
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,929
It's my pattern. It's what I do, and then
I started freaking out about the
fact that I hadn't freaked out.

640
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:53,016
You got caught in the circle of freak out.

641
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,270
What if this dress is really a bad sign,
not a good sign?

642
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:59,005
What if the dress is telling me
that it's so right, it's wrong?

643
00:25:59,089 --> 00:25:59,522
Mom...

644
00:25:59,604 --> 00:26:01,159
What if I'm about to bail out
and I don't even know it?

645
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,780
You are driving yourself crazy.

646
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,358
What if all the signs are saying that
things shouldn't be this easy,

647
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:07,033
that I shouldn't get the guy I want?

648
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,625
What if it's like that "twilight zone" where
the woman on a horse is being chased

649
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:13,811
by another woman on a horse who turns
out is older her chasing younger her,

650
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:17,267
trying to tell her that she should not run
off with the guy she's going to run off with

651
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:19,832
because it will be a terrible,
terrible mistake.

652
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:22,926
Okay King George, take a breath, eat a fry,
and listen to me.

653
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:27,217
The dress is a good sign.
Everything fell into place because it should.
It's all right.

654
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:29,355
The dress is right, the date is right,
Luke is right.

655
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:32,186
And the snow-- remember the snow?
The snow never lies.

656
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:33,447
I guess.

657
00:26:33,546 --> 00:26:35,224
Be happy. This is all good.

658
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:36,783
Thanks.

659
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:39,184
I'm gonna miss you when you're
murdered and stuffed

660
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:40,573
into a dumpster by the doo-wop group.

661
00:26:40,662 --> 00:26:41,771
Tell me about my dress.

662
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:43,234
Two words-- "hoopskirt."

663
00:26:43,326 --> 00:26:43,749
Nice.

664
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:45,459
In a lovely shade of tangerine.

665
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:46,153
Excellent.

666
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:48,661
The minute I saw it, I thought,
"this would totally be Rory

667
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,514
if only it had a few more ruffles."

668
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,728
A fry with your evilness?

669
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:52,677
Well, thank you.

670
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:04,324
Hello, stranger.

671
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,284
Hey.

672
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:08,002
Uh, can-- can I come in?

673
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:09,358
Why not?

674
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:13,592
Sorry about barging in on you like that.

675
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:14,869
Hey, it's fine.

676
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:16,495
I'm making tea. You want some tea?

677
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,072
Uh, sure. Tea sounds like tea.

678
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:20,693
April's not here right now.

679
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,536
She's tracking a grub migration.

680
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:24,730
All inquiries stopped after the word "grub."

681
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:27,533
That's okay. I came by to see you, actually.

682
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,985
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

683
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:31,743
You got a lot of stuff here.
You sell clothes?

684
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:34,346
Clothes, pillows, candles, fabrics.

685
00:27:34,428 --> 00:27:36,775
It's one of those everything kind of
boutiques that used to send you

686
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:40,475
in a "what do people need with
all this crap?" kind of rant.

687
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,609
Oh, yeah.

688
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,196
Well, that's nice.

689
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:44,994
- Thanks. Here.
- Thanks.

690
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:48,400
It tastes like tea.

691
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:50,818
Uh, this is weird.

692
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:51,736
I know.

693
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:53,254
It's been a very long time.

694
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:54,298
I know.

695
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,582
I actually saw you once about five years ago
in the parking lot of some lumberyard.

696
00:27:58,683 --> 00:27:59,169
Yeah?

697
00:27:59,272 --> 00:28:02,281
I waved, but you either didn't see
me or didn't want to see me.

698
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:05,869
I didn't see you. I would have waved back,
unless I was holding stuff,

699
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,976
and then I would have nodded or something.

700
00:28:08,077 --> 00:28:09,889
Sure. I'm sure.

701
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:11,936
I thought about you when the Red Sox won.

702
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:12,435
Really?

703
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:13,837
I knew it would be a big day for you.

704
00:28:13,935 --> 00:28:14,933
It was.

705
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:21,223
How come you didn't tell me, Anna?

706
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,196
- Luke...
- It was a phone call.

707
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,848
We should sit down.

708
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:32,841
I've been in the same place forever-- haven't
moved. You certainly knew how to find me.

709
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,219
Luke, come on. We'd already broken
up by the time I found out,

710
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:38,478
and I knew how you felt about kids.

711
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:39,979
What do you mean, how I felt about kids?

712
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:41,927
- You hate kids.
- I don't hate kids.

713
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:43,610
- What are you talking about?
- I don't.

714
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:47,809
We couldn't go the movies before 10:00 at
night in case there were kids in the theater.

715
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,253
Well, kids talk during a movie,
and they throw crap around.

716
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:52,024
They run up and down the aisles.
They're animals.

717
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:55,347
We would move tables in a restaurant
if they seated us near a family.

718
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:57,500
Only if there was something
crying or spitting up.

719
00:28:57,586 --> 00:29:00,470
You would flip out if you saw a
woman breast-feeding in public.

720
00:29:00,554 --> 00:29:02,642
You couldn't stand to watch
diaper commercials.

721
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:05,709
And you had an unnatural hatred
of Macaulay Culkin.

722
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:08,543
Okay, fine. I hated kids,
but I'm not that guy anymore.

723
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:10,459
13 years ago, you were that guy.

724
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,836
It doesn't mean I would have
been like that with my kid.

725
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:16,415
Even if I would have been like that with
my kid, I still had a right to know.

726
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:18,377
I'm sorry.

727
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:20,948
Yeah. Well, you know, I could have helped.

728
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,399
I could have helped pay for stuff
and take care of things.

729
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:27,048
I didn't need you to pay for stuff
and take care of things.

730
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,881
This was my responsibility, too.

731
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:31,800
And now that I know, I have to do something.

732
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:32,814
What does that mean?

733
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:35,892
It means I want to offer you
whatever assistance I can--

734
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,276
monetary, of course,
and compensation for the past 12 years.

735
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,683
But we really don't need anything.

736
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:44,197
It was not my idea for April to call you.
It was all her thing.

737
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:49,158
She got obsessed with winning that
science contest, and she's
really a smart, driven kid.

738
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:52,018
She's already written a short novel,
and she's got her own website.

739
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:55,258
So she went through my old letters
and put the whole thing together

740
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:58,720
and, frankly, didn't tell me anything
about it till way after the fact.

741
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:00,900
I did not send her to you.

742
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:04,204
I know you didn't, but she came to me,
and now I know, and I want to help.

743
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,066
I'm not talking about contact here.
I know you've got your life.

744
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:10,833
I don't want to mess things up. I just want
to live up to my end of the bargain.

745
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:14,469
You don't owe us anything, Luke.
We want for nothing and always have.

746
00:30:15,024 --> 00:30:19,366
But if you want to chip in, then, sure,
chip in.

747
00:30:19,497 --> 00:30:21,509
Really? Great. That's great.

748
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:24,802
That's really-- thank you.

749
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:25,868
Thank you.

750
00:30:26,044 --> 00:30:26,813
Yeah.

751
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:30,574
Okay, well, that's all I came to say, so--

752
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:32,900
so I guess I'll get going.

753
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:36,935
Luke, it was really great seeing you.

754
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:37,931
You too.

755
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:39,844
Tell April hi for me.

756
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:40,891
I will do that.

757
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:42,935
Hey, Luke.

758
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:43,831
Yeah?

759
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:44,794
You happy?

760
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:46,270
Yeah.

761
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,367
Me too.

762
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:48,773
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

763
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:49,914
Yeah, it is.

764
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:03,863
I brought coffee, but it's cold.

765
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:08,972
It's a nice place you got here.

766
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:12,001
I've been discussing the "baking soda to
actual crack" ratio you can get away with

767
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:15,113
with your neighbors downstairs.
2 to 1 during the daylight, 3 to 1 at night.

768
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:17,975
I have 10 minutes to change.
Then I have someplace to be.

769
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,801
It's gonna take you 20 to unlock your door.

770
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:20,859
Bye, Logan.

771
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,772
This place is a dump, Rory.
You can't live here.

772
00:31:23,003 --> 00:31:25,644
You don't get to care about where
I live anymore, Logan.

773
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,035
You broke up with me-- through your sister.

774
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,227
I didn't mean for that to happen.

775
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,982
You're a coward. Mr. life and death brigade
can't break up with his girlfriend.

776
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:36,149
Honor was bugging me,
and I told her we broke up to shut her up.
I needed some time.

777
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,976
- So you didn't mean it?
- No, I did. I just--

778
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:41,368
it was too much for me, okay?

779
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:42,659
It was a fight.

780
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:43,869
People fight.

781
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,618
I don't fight.
I don't want to be screaming at you at a bar.
I can't take that. It's too much drama.

782
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:51,381
Well, if you can't take the drama,
then you shouldn't even be in a relationship,

783
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,324
which, by the way, you're not,
so everything's good.

784
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,758
It's not that easy.

785
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:56,967
Sure, it is.

786
00:31:58,132 --> 00:31:58,885
You want some help?

787
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,707
Nope.

788
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:02,652
I bet one of those guys downstairs could help
you out getting into a locked apartment.

789
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:05,504
Just go be somewhere else, Logan.

790
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,911
I thought that I wanted to break up.
I thought that it was a stupid experiment--

791
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:12,206
me trying to be a boyfriend,
that it didn't work, and I'd just move on.

792
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:14,011
And I didn't-- couldn't, actually.

793
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:14,794
Rory...

794
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,265
I love you.

795
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,322
I have an appointment. I have to go.

796
00:32:24,912 --> 00:32:25,882
Sorry I'm late.

797
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:30,692
Well, considering how many times
you rescheduled, I'm just
happy you're here at all.

798
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:32,453
I was just spending some time with my mother.

799
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:33,762
We were apart for a while.

800
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:34,420
You were?

801
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:35,054
Yeah.

802
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:36,170
A falling-out?

803
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,980
Nothing major-- just mother/daughter stuff.

804
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:41,647
I don't have to lie down, do I?

805
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:44,226
No. That's not a "lying down" couch.

806
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,138
Good.

807
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:49,748
So, did this falling-out have anything to
do with your dropping out of school?

808
00:32:49,854 --> 00:32:51,972
Boy, we just jumped into this, didn't we?

809
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,011
You want to talk about something else first?

810
00:32:54,816 --> 00:32:55,519
No.

811
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:59,125
I mean,
we're here to talk about you leaving school,
so I figured, "let's just start there."

812
00:32:59,213 --> 00:32:59,990
What happened?

813
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:01,031
Nothing.

814
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:02,033
We fought.

815
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,071
I'm fine. We're fine.

816
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:05,977
I hear you had some legal problems.

817
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:08,430
My, those are some big ears
you have there, grandma.

818
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:10,175
Stealing a boat is a pretty big deal.

819
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:11,859
- I was upset.
- About what?

820
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:18,460
About life and things and stuff.

821
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,960
You spent a night in jail?

822
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,563
Yes, I did.

823
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,850
How did that feel?

824
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,484
Great.

825
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,908
You don't want to talk about this, either?

826
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:28,432
I'm just-- I'm sick of talking
about it-- that's all.

827
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,853
You seem very agitated.

828
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:31,089
I'm not agitated.

829
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,403
So, I spent a night in jail-- big deal.

830
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:35,444
So did Martin Luther King.

831
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,727
Are you comparing yourself
with Martin Luther King?

832
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,994
No, I'm not. I just-- I'm saying that
he spent a night in jail, too.

833
00:33:42,092 --> 00:33:43,884
You were arrested with your boyfriend?

834
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:45,029
Yes, I was.

835
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:46,002
Tell me about that.

836
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:48,747
About what? He was my boyfriend then,
and now he's not.

837
00:33:48,844 --> 00:33:49,401
He's not?

838
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,721
No, he's not.

839
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:51,779
We broke up.

840
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:54,270
Oh, no. I'm sorry. He broke up.

841
00:33:54,377 --> 00:33:58,181
I thought that we were just taking some time,
but apparently I'm a moron.

842
00:33:58,261 --> 00:33:59,845
Uh, this is Logan?

843
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:01,655
What, you have his name, too?

844
00:34:01,758 --> 00:34:05,147
Super. Do you also have the picture of him
hijacking me in my hallway earlier today?

845
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:06,035
I'm sorry. What?

846
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,413
I mean, how fair is that?

847
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:10,769
He's gone,
and then he shows up out of the blue.

848
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,921
"You can't live here. This place is a dump.

849
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,943
And, by the way, I love you."

850
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,050
"I love you"?!

851
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:17,341
Is he serious?!

852
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,233
I don't know.

853
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:22,740
Nothing for weeks,
and then he just decides that he loves me.

854
00:34:22,823 --> 00:34:25,768
So, what happens now?
I get another Birkin bag?

855
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:28,701
And how long until he doesn't
love me again, huh?

856
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,399
I stole a boat with him!

857
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:34,626
I never stole a boat with Dean!

858
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:35,503
Who's Dean?

859
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:38,942
My married ex-boyfriend who
I lost my virginity to!

860
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:40,163
Wow.

861
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,639
Yeah. I'm a treat.

862
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:45,175
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

863
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,814
I-I don't think I can take running
into him every day in the halls

864
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,035
and the paper and the coffee cart.

865
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:54,377
Oh, my god.

866
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:56,769
I'm gonna have to quit drinking coffee,

867
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:58,910
and I love coffee!

868
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,891
I really love coffee.

869
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:07,458
I feel like an idiot.

870
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:10,597
Just relax, Luke.
It should only take a couple more minutes.

871
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:12,594
I've been following you around
for half an hour.

872
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,560
I know there's a wireless internet
hub around here somewhere.

873
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:17,466
Ah!

874
00:35:19,504 --> 00:35:21,017
No. Encrypted.

875
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:24,857
I used to use the bank's access, but
I had to stand right in front
of the versateller machine,

876
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:26,997
and they got very snippy about that.

877
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:30,180
And Doose's had it for a while,
but Taylor but a block on it.

878
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:31,815
It's sad what this world is coming to.

879
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,892
Why don't I just find someone who
actually has the internet?

880
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:36,052
Hold on.

881
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:37,463
Hold on.

882
00:35:38,712 --> 00:35:40,974
We have achieved contact.

883
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:41,562
We have?

884
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:44,672
Yes, courtesy of Stars Hollow books.

885
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:46,131
Okay. Now, tell me what you need.

886
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:48,425
Uh, I just, uh, need to look up a website.

887
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:50,017
Okay. Give me the name,
and I'll type it in for you.

888
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,686
Hold on-- is this one of those websites?

889
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:54,991
'Cause if they'll come after Pete Townsend,
no one is safe.

890
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,953
Kirk, just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it myself.

891
00:35:57,049 --> 00:35:58,652
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Just-- here.

892
00:35:58,762 --> 00:36:01,058
- Okay, give me your hand, and--
- Stop it.

893
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:07,837
All right. Just click here,
then type in the name of the website here,
then press here.

894
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,647
This makes the page go up and down.

895
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:11,162
I can figure out the rest, Kirk.

896
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,980
All right. I'll be over here if you need me.

897
00:36:14,081 --> 00:36:16,003
I've never felt safer in my life.

898
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:52,220
Thank you for coming.
We appreciate your business.

899
00:36:52,832 --> 00:36:54,965
Everything's dusted.
The receipts are organized.

900
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:56,722
I'm not hungry. I'm going upstairs.

901
00:36:59,054 --> 00:37:00,387
Lane Kim!

902
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,044
Come down now!

903
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:10,112
Follow me.

904
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:24,352
Help me.

905
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,142
Good. Come.

906
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:02,372
Whoa.

907
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:05,995
Lane, it's been six weeks
since you come home.

908
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:08,222
You have grieved, and now we move on.

909
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:21,462
One more.

910
00:38:27,397 --> 00:38:28,238
Hey, buddy.

911
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,051
Yeah, there is something
weird about it, right?

912
00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:34,561
What? What is it?

913
00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:45,847
Hello?

914
00:38:45,953 --> 00:38:47,018
Guess who's crazy.

915
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:48,175
- Who?
- Me.

916
00:38:48,273 --> 00:38:49,553
You? Since when?

917
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:53,097
Since I went all Frances Farmer in
my psychologist evaluation today.

918
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:54,770
I'm on the bed and comfortable.

919
00:38:54,857 --> 00:38:56,873
Should I get popcorn,
or is it a shorter story than that?

920
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,873
I went home from class to get ready for
the appointment, and Logan was there.

921
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:01,753
At your apartment?

922
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:02,789
In the hallway.

923
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:05,972
And, of course,
I couldn't get my door open fast enough,
so he started talking.

924
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:06,908
What did he say?

925
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,118
He said he loved me.

926
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:09,145
No way.

927
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:10,832
And it completely threw me.

928
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:12,718
And I got out of there as fast as I could.

929
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:16,864
But then I got to Dr. Shapiro's office,
and he started peppering
me with all these questions,

930
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,446
and I just got more and more upset.

931
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:20,408
Then I exploded all over the place.

932
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:23,877
I went through two boxes of kleenex,
I started hyperventilating,

933
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,500
and I had to breathe into a paper bag.

934
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:26,426
Do you believe him?

935
00:39:26,523 --> 00:39:27,312
Believe who?

936
00:39:27,503 --> 00:39:29,235
Logan-- do you believe he loves you?

937
00:39:29,335 --> 00:39:31,697
I don't know. I guess I can figure
that out next week in therapy.

938
00:39:31,778 --> 00:39:32,316
What?

939
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,913
After my little meltdown, Dr.
Shapiro thinks I should come see him

940
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:36,902
once a week for the next two months.

941
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:37,747
You're kidding.

942
00:39:37,848 --> 00:39:42,321
No jokes in the mental-health field,
only hand puppets, inkblots,
and inflatable anger bats.

943
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:44,052
I'm so sorry you're a nut.

944
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:46,821
It's okay. I'm sure Dr.
Shapiro has a nice padded room for me.

945
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:48,707
Don't let them put you on any of those pills.

946
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,165
Tom Cruise will be very upset.

947
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:52,897
All right. I should go.
I have a massive amount of reading to do.

948
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:54,406
I just wanted to call and say hi.

949
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:56,914
Okay. Remember-- blame it all on grandma.

950
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:57,455
Will do.

951
00:39:57,548 --> 00:39:58,296
- Bye.
- Bye.

952
00:40:13,896 --> 00:40:14,779
Okay.

953
00:40:18,034 --> 00:40:18,787
Hold on.

954
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:19,941
Hello?

955
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:23,308
Just a sec.
Major pillow emergency happening here.

956
00:40:23,411 --> 00:40:24,818
What? Anna?

957
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:26,488
Sorry. Hi. Who's this?

958
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:27,526
It's, uh, Luke.

959
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:28,497
Luke?

960
00:40:28,604 --> 00:40:29,907
Wow, when it rains, it--

961
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:30,897
I saw her website.

962
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:31,774
Her?

963
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:34,327
I saw her pictures-- in the lab
and with the Christmas tree.

964
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:37,185
You never told me she wore a back brace.
Why was she wearing a back brace?

965
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:39,438
Oh, she had just read "Deenie."
It was a phase.

966
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:41,789
Well, still, I should have known.

967
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:43,118
That she had just read "Deenie"?

968
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:45,686
Yes, and that she was going through
a phase and was a science wiz

969
00:40:45,783 --> 00:40:49,415
and wore crazy bike helmets and
glasses and looked like me.

970
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:50,388
Just the nose.

971
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:54,566
The nose is something. I mean, there's no
one else running around with my nose.

972
00:40:54,656 --> 00:40:55,892
That you know of.

973
00:40:56,185 --> 00:40:57,501
Is this funny to you?

974
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:58,915
No. I'm sorry.

975
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:00,166
You should've told me.

976
00:41:00,285 --> 00:41:02,490
Luke, we went through all this already. I--

977
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:04,035
- I want contact.
- What?

978
00:41:04,123 --> 00:41:07,875
I want a relationship. I want to talk to
her and see her on a regular basis.

979
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,995
- But you said-- - I don't care what I said.
This is what I want.

980
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:12,897
I want to know my own daughter,
and I want her to know me.

981
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:14,576
Okay.

982
00:41:16,126 --> 00:41:16,830
Really?

983
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:20,389
Well, it's really up to April,
but if she's cool, then I'm cool.

984
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:21,613
Oh.

985
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:27,230
So, uh, is, uh, April there now?

986
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,244
No. But she'll be home pretty soon.

987
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:31,213
Can I have her call you?

988
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:33,264
- Yes. No.
- No?

989
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:34,763
I should call her.

990
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,503
She'll definitely be home by 8:00.

991
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:39,211
Then I will call back at 8:00.

992
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:40,000
Okay.

993
00:41:40,091 --> 00:41:40,695
Thanks.

994
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:41,728
You're welcome.

995
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:43,324
Hey, Anna?

996
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:46,002
What the hell is "Deenie"?

997
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,822
The gospel according to Judy Blume.

998
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,433
- What?
- It's a book, Luke.

999
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:53,065
And now would probably be a good
time for you to read it.

1000
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:53,963
Bye.

1001
00:41:54,157 --> 00:41:54,956
Bye.

1002
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:06,258
Lorelai!

1003
00:42:06,615 --> 00:42:08,380
Uh, Luke, I'm upstairs!

1004
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:15,885
Yeah, uh, can you come down?
I have to talk to you about something.

1005
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:19,674
Okay. Yes, I will come down,
but I'm coming down in my wedding dress.

1006
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:20,587
What? No!

1007
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,389
Yes!

1008
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,708
It's bad luck for me to
see the wedding dress.

1009
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:26,741
I know, but I need you to see this dress.
There's something not right up here.

1010
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:29,228
It was too easy.
I can't be objective anymore.

1011
00:42:29,335 --> 00:42:30,669
- But--
- Coming down.

1012
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:31,639
But I don't--

1013
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:37,784
Well?

1014
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,689

1015
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:41,661
You're perfect.

1016
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:43,505
Really? Have you seen the back?

1017
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:47,891

00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:50,151
It's perfect.

1019
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:51,069
Are you sure?

1020
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:00,906
Okay.

1021
00:43:01,524 --> 00:43:03,608
It's not bad luck if it's under five minutes.
