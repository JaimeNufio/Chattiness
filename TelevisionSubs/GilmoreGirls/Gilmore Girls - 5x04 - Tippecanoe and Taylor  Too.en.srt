1
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:07,718
Hey, you're up.

2
00:00:07,827 --> 00:00:09,034
Hey, you're cooking.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,413
Yep, making the works. Even threw a couple blintzes in there to confuse you.

4
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:14,242
Wow. Where did all this come from?

5
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:14,980
What?

6
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:18,010
The food, the pans, the bowls, the spatula.

7
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:21,154
Food's from Doose's, pans and bowls, you had, and the spatula's mine.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,510
- You travel with a spatula?
- Sometimes.

9
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,840
You've actually found yourself in scraping and flipping situations without the trusty spatula before?

10
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:29,284
Your coffee should be ready in a minute.

11
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,640
Smells good.

12
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:35,587
- Hey, Luke?
- Yep?

13
00:00:36,374 --> 00:00:39,473
You cooking this is so sweet...

14
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:41,388
But?

15
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:43,130
I just figured, you know, we'd go to Luke's for breakfast.

16
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:44,007
Why?

17
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:45,965
Because I like Luke's breakfast.

18
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:47,225
- I am Luke.
- I know.

19
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:48,864
- This is the same stuff I make at the diner.
- I know.

20
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:49,590
So what's the difference?

21
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:52,074
Well, the difference is, while you are Luke, we're not at Luke's.

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,571
So?

23
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:56,979
Well, I have my things, you know? I have certain things. And one of my things is going to Luke's.

24
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:00,604
And just because I now have "Dating Luke"

25
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:02,994
doesn't mean I want to lose my "Cooking Luke. "

26
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,961
But I am cooking, and I am Luke.

27
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:08,344
Look, it's like Tommy Lee having a Starbucks at his house.

28
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:08,929
What?

29
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,114
On the surface, it sounds great. But half the reason you go to a Starbucks

30
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,386
is to go to a Starbucks, you know, to go out and see the people.

31
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:16,353
Tommy Lee has a Starbucks in his house?

32
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:17,570
"Cribs," baby. Watch it.

33
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,635
Like a whole Starbucks with workers and everything?

34
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:24,274
The point is that, while some things have changed - and that's great -

35
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,645
I don't want everything to change completely.

36
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,298
Okay. I'll see you at Luke's.

37
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,788
Ah, I'll see you at Luke's!

38
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:31,290
Hello?

39
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:34,369
"Cultural Disenfranchisement with Women's Role Models" - do you have it?

40
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:35,528
Oh, God, I hope not.

41
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,554
It's the book for the class I'm officially late to.

42
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,371
- What are you looking for?
- A big, boring book.

43
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:41,544
- Who is that?
- It's Luke?

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,781
- Who's that?
- It's Rory.

45
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,574
Luke. It's pretty early in the morning for Luke to be there.

46
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,422
Unless, perhaps, he woke up there.

47
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:48,593
Well, he did.

48
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:50,402
"He did" what? Are you talking about me?

49
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:52,033
- Man, that's weird.
- What's weird?

50
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:53,007
Who's weird? I'm weird?

51
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:55,357
The thought of Luke running around naked in my kitchen. It's weird.

52
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:58,261
Luke is not running around naked in your kitchen. He is sitting at the table,

53
00:01:58,347 --> 00:01:59,330
and, yes, he is naked.

54
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:03,135
Don't do that. Don't tell her I'm naked. I'm not naked. I'm not naked!

55
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,250
- He sounds naked.
- Well, the chairs are cold.

56
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,787
- He actually tried to make me breakfast.
- Really?

57
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:11,348
- Yeah, naked.
- Okay, that's it, I'm gone.

58
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:15,202
Oh, no, no, no. Sorry, don't, no. Rory, Luke is fully dressed.

59
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:17,073
He never came in the house.

60
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:20,650
He just stood outside all night playing "In Your Eyes" on a boom box.

61
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,410
I have to go. If you find the book, bring it to Friday-night dinner, okay?

62
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:25,187
- You got it.
- Go back to your dirtiness.

63
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:23,858
Thanks a lot.

64
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,938
I photographed it before you moved it, so if there's any damage, you'll be hearing from my lawyer.

65
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,792
- Hi.
- Hi. Introduce me to your friend.

66
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:32,690
This is a Blou printing press, 18th century.

67
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,724
And it's here because?

68
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:36,816
It's Asher's. He left it to me. It's beautiful, don't you think?

69
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:39,904
Yeah. Think it goes great with the entire width of the room.

70
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,448
I know it's a little cumbersome, but we don't have to leave it right here.

71
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,240
We could move it about six inches in any direction.

72
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:46,396
Paris, we can't just leave it here.

73
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:47,922
- I have nowhere else to put it.
- But...

74
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,796
You have to think of the benefits of having it here.

75
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:50,452
Like?

76
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:54,569
No one else will have one, which means it's unique, which makes us unique.

77
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,859
Kids our age do crazy things to make themselves unique - piercings, blue hair, Kabbalah.

78
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,470
It will be a great conversation piece. We'll be the talk of Branford.

79
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:02,330
I believe we will.

80
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:03,907
We can print our own newsletter, if you'd like.

81
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:05,591
"The Eccentric Gazette". I love it.

82
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,718
It's from Asher. Just try it for a while. I promise if it gets in the way, we'll get rid of it.

83
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:12,063
Paris, it's on my book bag.

84
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,115
I'm late for class, and you put a printing press on my book bag?

85
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,422
Well, sorry. It's from my dead boyfriend, okay?

86
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:22,933
I apologize if my grief is inconveniencing you. Maybe I'll just put myself on an iceberg

87
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:25,888
and float myself out to sea so that no one will have to deal with my suffering.

88
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:28,524
Well, just get that thing off my bag before you go.

89
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:32,282
This is outrageous, and he will call me back

90
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:36,629
and it had better be in a timely manner, or I will come down there and introduce myself,

91
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:40,177
and, oh, the fun we'll have. Tst!

92
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,975
I hate this chair!

93
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:44,586
What's the matter honey - Justin and Cameron having trouble again?

94
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:48,538
I just got off the phone with the very promising young man working as Taylor's assistant

95
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,403
to try and talk to the man about this.

96
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:52,569
No, no. He rejected it again?

97
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,852
I believe that is what the bright red letters say.

98
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:57,181
We only need two lousy parking spaces. What is his problem?

99
00:04:57,274 --> 00:04:59,040
Oh, the list is long.

100
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,760
- This is the third time, Michel.
- I know.

101
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:04,503
This is the third time that "Bus-and-Truck-Tour Mussolini" has rejected our permit.

102
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:05,968
And I was there for every show.

103
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:07,329
What is rejection code "M"?

104
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:12,039
"Applicant's name does not match name listed on articles of incorporation. "

105
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,381
Ohh! Is he serious?!

106
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,762
Apparently you did not put your middle name on this application.

107
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,875
However, you did put your middle name on the articles of incorporation.

108
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:20,985
So the names don't match, and Taylor has no idea who you are.

109
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:24,604
Oh, I'm the person whose foot is going to prevent him from sitting down. That's who I am.

110
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,004
You always promise to hurt him, but then you don't. You're a Taylor tease.

111
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:29,202
I'm getting coffee.

112
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:32,899
Ah, perfect timing!

113
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,738
Oh, Sookie, I really need some coffee.

114
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:35,637
First this.

115
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,438
But it's right over there, and - okay, what am I looking at?

116
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,835
- Jackson's tomatoes.
- Here we go.

117
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,749
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna get a little...

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,618
Eat this.

119
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:50,727
Isn't that the greatest tomato you've ever eaten?

120
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:52,340
- It's good.
- Good?

121
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:54,025
- It's great.
- Great?

122
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:55,811
All I wanted was a cup of coffee.

123
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:59,410
Oh, thank you. Sorry, Jackson. This is one rocking tomato.

124
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:02,498
This is the first batch grown in my brand-new hydroponic greenhouse.

125
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:04,904
- Jackson designed it himself.
- Built most of it myself, too.

126
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,958
You know what this means.

127
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:09,292
The best tomatoes on the East coast, and in October.

128
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,213
Huh! October!

129
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:14,889
- Heh. It sure ain't November.
- This means year-round vegetables.

130
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:18,205
I am never gonna be a slave to Mother Nature again. If I wanna make it...

131
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:19,435
Then I'm gonna grow it.

132
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:21,817
Aw, you two really found each other, didn't you?

133
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,434
Do you want another piece of tomato?

134
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:24,540
Do I?

135
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,784
Boys, leave us, please.

136
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:37,268
Ben Franklin was out of his mind.

137
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,233
- Hey.
- Hey.

138
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:43,448
So, come on in. Dean, you remember Paris.

139
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,460
Yes, I do. Uh, how you doing, Paris?

140
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:46,545
I'm fine.

141
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:49,412
What's that?

142
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:53,877
Uh, that's a printing press. Haven't you heard? Tats are out, movable type is in.

143
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:54,799
I've heard that.

144
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:57,390
So, my room's in there.

145
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:00,794
- Nice to see you again, Paris.
- Right back at you.

146
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,500
You're back with Farmer Boy? What gives?

147
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:06,001
- Paris...
- I thought he was married.

148
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:07,195
He was - now he's not.

149
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:09,693
Well, well - Hoss returns. Who would've thunk?

150
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,972
- I'm going in my room now.
- Just hold on.

151
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,070
- We have to figure this out.
- Figure what out?

152
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,619
You're going to be bringing boys home now. We need a system.

153
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:19,666
I'm not bringing "boys" home. I'm bringing "boy" home. That boy - that's it.

154
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,085
- I assume you're having sex.
- Paris!

155
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:24,458
You're having sex. Well, luckily, I just bought some noise-reducing headphones,

156
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:25,765
- so that'll help.
- Oh boy.

157
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,893
If I put the headphones on, then stuff towels under the door, that should do the trick.

158
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:31,778
Hey, if you've got extra towels to stuff, I got a location suggestion.

159
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,531
- How loud are you?
- Paris, stop.

160
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:36,481
Look, I don't care. I just need the information to formulate a good plan.

161
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,451
I mean, you look all small and squeaky, but sometimes,

162
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,283
it's exactly the bunny-looking girls who can blow the roof off the barn.

163
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,777
- I know, just give me a three-minute warning.
- I'm walking away now.

164
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:47,982
That way, I have time to put everything in place. Put headphones on, et cetera.

165
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:49,774
- Bye.
- Is he gonna be coming over a lot?

166
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,265
Probably, right? He's at his peak now, and it's probably one of the only things he's good at so...

167
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:54,632
- Three-minute warning!
- Right.

168
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,186
Bread.

169
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:06,716
That's $1.10, so we're at $17.33.

170
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,097
- And jam.
- Generic.

171
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:11,599
- Yes, Mom.
- $1.40, so we're at $18.73.

172
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,695
Yo, John Nash, enough with the numbers.

173
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,132
I'm just keeping track so we don't go over.

174
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:17,093
It's too much pressure. I can't think.

175
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,706
If we use coupons, it would stretch our money.

176
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:22,578
Dude, the only thing more un-rock 'n' roll than coupons is that shirt you're wearing.

177
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:24,355
I've asked you about this shirt. You never said anything.

178
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:26,003
We're not using coupons.

179
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,498
Get enough brewskis there, buddy?

180
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,352
Don't worry, I'm using my own money for this.

181
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:30,688
- Okay, just�
- Just what?

182
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,772
I'm not sure why you need all that beer, that's all.

183
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:36,654
We've got gigs coming up, and I've kinda learned through experience that if you say to people,

184
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:40,446
"Hey, wanna come back for some beers?" And you don't have beer, they get pissed and leave.

185
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:41,378
- People?
- Right.

186
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,206
- Meaning "girls".
- I would prefer it be girls.

187
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:46,078
Good. Well then, stock up, then, Hef. Get some extra for Jimmy Caan.

188
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:47,164
Hey, guys. How you doing?

189
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,602
Great. Hope you're not here for beer. I think we're buying it all up.

190
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:52,264
- I'm just here for diapers.
- Any of your girlfriends need diapers?

191
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,804
- What is your problem?
- Problem? No problem.

192
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:56,446
Milk.

193
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,181
Lane, that was a real brand. Lane.

194
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,405
That makes $27, $28, $29, $30, and $10 makes $40.

195
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:06,099
And here - here, take a balloon for the little miss. Election's on Tuesday.

196
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:08,249
Morning, Maggie. How's the family?

197
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,008
A pain in my rear. Don't say I said that.

198
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:12,442
- Morning, Jackson.
- Hi, Taylor.

199
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,769
Hey, are these the best you got?

200
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:16,415
Unfortunately, October's a terrible time for tomatoes.

201
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:19,088
I guess I could always go with canned. I hate canned.

202
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:21,744
Hey, if you're needing more, Taylor, I got a nice crop of tomatoes.

203
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,430
We could work something out.

204
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:27,966
Well, that's nice of you to offer. You're growing them in that big new greenhouse, right?

205
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:30,766
- Built it with my own two hands.
- That's very industrious.

206
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,436
Too bad about what's happening with all that.

207
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,799
Yeah� What?

208
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:36,184
- Nice cukes, though.
- Beautiful cukes.

209
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:39,640
I love cukes in a tricolore salad - adds a nice crunch.

210
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:41,790
Uh, "too bad about all" what, Taylor?

211
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:44,453
Oh, you know - the greenhouse.

212
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:46,225
The greenhouse? What about the greenhouse?

213
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:47,786
Wait - aren't the cukes three for $1?

214
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,670
- They're two for $1.
- It said three.

215
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,784
Barry, I need a price check on cucumbers.

216
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,740
- Taylor?
- Jackson, please.

217
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:56,988
This is not the proper forum to discuss the problem with your greenhouse.

218
00:09:57,044 --> 00:10:00,172
- What problem?!
- Barry, if you hear me, yell "10-4."

219
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:03,761
I'll check the price on the stupid cucumbers! Just tell me what's up with the greenhouse!

220
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:05,915
Jackson, this is my place of business.

221
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:09,751
The unpleasantness with your structure will all be settled at the next town meeting.

222
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:13,995
- I'm not hearing a "10-4," Barry.
- I can't go to the town meeting. I'm watching the baby.

223
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:17,062
- Oh, I'd get a babysitter if I was you.
- 10-4.

224
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:19,858
- You were out smoking again, weren't you, Barry?
- No.

225
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,002
- Don't lie. I'll smell your breath.
-10-4.

226
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:25,746
I don't like the tone of that "10-4."

227
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:29,653
I usually like grocery shopping. This stripped it of all enjoyment.

228
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,229
I thought you hated grocery shopping with the guys. You always bicker.

229
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:35,915
But that's fun bickering. That's bickering we'll look back on in 20 years,

230
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:38,084
slap each other on the backs and say, "wha-ho, good times. "

231
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,108
So you'll be Dickens characters in 20 years?

232
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,213
You know what I mean. I know - I have no right

233
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:45,305
to be bothered by Zach luring women back to the apartment with cheap beer,

234
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:49,104
because I haven't told him I like him. I mean, if I had told him I like him

235
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:51,439
and he was doing that, he'd be a creep of the first order.

236
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,056
As it is, he's just exhibiting basic guy behavior -

237
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:58,208
grunt, grunt, caveman stuff, which, to be honest, is a bit of the appeal of Zach.

238
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,280
- So why don't you tell him?
- There's a danger here.

239
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,381
- The roommate thing.
- The band thing.

240
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,934
Need I mention the rock 'n' roll casualties from intraband dating?

241
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,094
- I know they're numerous.
- Not that there's not success stories.

242
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,843
I mean, you've got your Cramps, your Yo La Tengo, your Kim and Thurstons.

243
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:13,179
Sonny and Cher, the Early Years.

244
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,133
Plus, you've got bands that have survived breakups - No Doubt.

245
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:16,870
Wish they hadn't.

246
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:20,049
X, Supertramp, The White Stripes. But in the negative, you have...

247
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,469
- Sonny and Cher, the Later Years.
- Jefferson Airplane, Fleetwood Mac.

248
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:27,018
I know of two country music stars whose backup singers shot them in the groin.

249
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:28,339
Whoa. That's wicked hate.

250
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:31,124
- My batteries are dead.
- Hold on, Lane. Your batteries?

251
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,106
For my headphones. When's Dean getting here?

252
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:35,492
Calm down Paris. We're just gonna watch a movie, and you're welcome to join us.

253
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:39,189
Please. You're 19. Unless it's "Shoah," you two are getting carnal.

254
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:43,883
- Sorry. You were saying?
- You've got the data. Now I need insight.

255
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:46,786
I think you should just tell him. This is not going away, so find the right moment,

256
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:50,304
and see what he says. Don't mention that intraband dating stuff. Just follow your heart.

257
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:53,586
Heart. Ho, the girls in Heart really screwed things up big-time.

258
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,589
Hang on.

259
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,221
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

260
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:58,748
Oh, hey. You about on your way?

261
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:01,327
Unfortunately, no. I have no way to get there.

262
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:02,612
Oh, what happened to your car?

263
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:04,666
Uh, nothing. It's just, um...

264
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,160
Lindsay needed it.

265
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:07,676
Oh, right.

266
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:11,650
I don't know what for. She just needed it for some reason, and we're still kind of sharing it.

267
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,853
Right. Drag.

268
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:15,444
I'll look to see if there's a bus or something.

269
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:16,524
That could take hours.

270
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,475
Yeah. You want to come here?

271
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,215
To Stars Hollow? How?

272
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,109
Drive. You got your car.

273
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,082
Oh, yeah, I do. Yeah, no, of course.

274
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,503
Um, I have a car, and I'll drive to you.

275
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:28,766
Good. I mean, if you want to.

276
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:32,355
Definitely. Yeah, and now Paris doesn't have to go get batteries.

277
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:33,092
What?

278
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:34,653
Nothing. I'll see you in about an hour?

279
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:35,898
- My place?
- See you there.

280
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:36,697
Bye.

281
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:39,323
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

282
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,278
Listen, I'm going to play two Rilo Kiley songs -

283
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,027
one pre-Jenny/Blake breakup, one post.

284
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,115
Tell me if you hear a quality difference.

285
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:56,240
The ferocity of attack is not affected by whether they're in the larval or nymphal life stage

286
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,949
or whether they're of the one-, two-, or three-host variety.

287
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:01,764
Oh, I hate this, Taylor. Every year.

288
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:03,522
Yeah, we get it - ticks are bad.

289
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:06,815
Maybe people who are new to our town - thus, new to the town meeting -

290
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:09,117
don't know the hazards of the common tick.

291
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:11,693
Ticks are bad! Moving on!

292
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,985
Don't hate the tick messenger. Hate the tick.

293
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:16,930
Now, to continue�

294
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,712
He's ruined the word "nymphal" for me forever.

295
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,483
4 bucks an hour to a babysitter for a tick lecture?

296
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:24,298
- Don't worry, honey. He'll get to us.
- Waste of time.

297
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:26,853
That's when a tick clamps onto his host,

298
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:31,892
plunges his hypostome into the skin, and feasts on his next blood meal.

299
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:35,080
You take too much delight in this, Taylor.

300
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:37,041
Go on, Taylor. He's sucking out the blood...

301
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:43,581
They feed for extensive periods, and at large volumes, up to 500 times their body weight.

302
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:50,200
This would be the equivalent of a 150-pound man drinking 9,000 gallons of human blood.

303
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:52,827
Taylor, please! We get it!

304
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:55,238
Let's just vote on whatever it is you want us to vote on.

305
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,795
- Before I hurl.
- Yeah!

306
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:57,660
Fine.

307
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:03,133
The question before us is, shall the town incur the expense of posting signs urging residents

308
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:06,130
to tuck their pants into their socks during tick season?

309
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:07,117
In favor?

310
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,042
Opposed?

311
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:15,472
The measure is defeated by an irresponsible, devil-may-care majority.

312
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:18,944
Now we move on to the next item -

313
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:24,423
the matter of the town Stars Hollow vs. Land parcel 11423-A.

314
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:27,772
- Is the parcel holder present?
- If that's me, I'm here.

315
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:29,792
The parcel holder is present.

316
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:36,773
Now, said parcel is cited as being in violation of section 423, subsection 4c,

317
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:42,870
subsection 32-b, formerly known as section 424, subsection...

318
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:43,792
Enough!

319
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:45,526
Yeah, this is more painful than ticks!

320
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:48,317
So, the parcel holder requests the reading of the citation be waived?

321
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,409
Waive it. Waive it. Just tell me what the hell is wrong with my greenhouse.

322
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:53,228
It's built too close to the edge of your property.

323
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:55,445
It's miles away from the edge of my property.

324
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:57,554
It's 91/2 feet from the edge of your property.

325
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:58,354
Exactly.

326
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,592
According to town codes, no new structure can come within 10 feet of the edge of your property.

327
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:04,103
Oh, that's a technicality.

328
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:05,956
No, that's the law.

329
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:09,592
And as town selectman, it's up to me to see that you abide by it.

330
00:15:09,735 --> 00:15:11,308
Unbelievable!

331
00:15:11,414 --> 00:15:14,199
There's a simple solution, if you want to hear it.

332
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:15,270
I do, yes.

333
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:17,409
Just move it over six inches.

334
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:20,599
Oh, well, you should have just said that before.

335
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:21,681
Perhaps I should have.

336
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,466
Just move the greenhouse over six inches?

337
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:24,193
That's right.

338
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:26,529
Good thing I built it on wheels so I could just scooch it over.

339
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:29,263
- Oh, it's on wheels?
- No, it's not on wheels!

340
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:31,081
Because wheels would have been handy.

341
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:34,587
I would have to tear it down to move it over six inches, Taylor!

342
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,388
Hmmm. Too bad you didn't check with me before you built it.

343
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:38,817
Could have saved you some heartache.

344
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:41,530
Okay, that's not English, hon.

345
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:45,524
- Come on, Taylor. This is ridiculous.
- This issue is not open for debate.

346
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:47,910
This is a nice man who is growing some very nice tomatoes,

347
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:52,616
and you just need to oil your knees and go see the wizard and get a heart and drop this!

348
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,220
What is this, Lorelai - lingering resentment over the parking space issue?

349
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:59,450
Well come on, you rejected it because I left out my middle name.

350
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,257
How many other Lorelai Gilmores do you know?

351
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,349
Well, there's your daughter.

352
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:04,929
Okay. So you know two.

353
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:07,101
Bet you can't name a third, unless you knew my grandma.

354
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:08,948
I think it's about time to adjourn this meeting.

355
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:10,766
Oh, we're not done with this, Taylor!

356
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:11,734
I think we are.

357
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:13,296
Don't bang that gavel!

358
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:15,338
Your issue is not with me.

359
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:18,777
I am merely the humble vessel for the municipal code.

360
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:20,795
Maybe it's time for a different vessel.

361
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,368
- Where's he going with this?
- Not sure.

362
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:23,453
A different vessel?

363
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,617
That's right. A different vessel. I'm running.

364
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,139
For what?

365
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:30,273
For whatever it is you are. What are you again?

366
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:31,226
Town Selectman.

367
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:32,864
I'm running for town selectman.

368
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:36,684
- Nobody ever runs against Taylor.
- He's our Papa Doc.

369
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:39,955
- Hon, shouldn't we maybe talk about this?
- Well, I accept the challenge.

370
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:42,693
And I look forward to a lively race.

371
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:48,286
Competition is the whetstone that sharpens the blade of democracy.

372
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:51,198
- Meeting adjourned.
- Whatever you need, friend, I'm with you.

373
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,531
- I need your vote.
- You got it.

374
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,644
Jackson Belleville, running for selectman. I need your vote.

375
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,115
Jackson Belleville - that's with four "L's".

376
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,670
- I know. We went to high school together.
- I still need your vote!

377
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:05,224
We're gonna need buttons and balloons and a slogan. How about something like -

378
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,543
I don't know - "Taylor sucks like a tick"?

379
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:09,453
Don't worry. First blurb. We'll work it out.

380
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:17,864
Hey.

381
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:19,355
Wow. You made good time.

382
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:20,127
No traffic.

383
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:21,372
Come on in.

384
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,813
Your mom got a new plant.

385
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:25,879
Yeah.

386
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,443
- Rory!
- Oh, hi, Clara.

387
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,381
I'm so glad you're back. I never liked Lindsay.

388
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:32,140
Clara!

389
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:34,351
- I wouldn't say that to Lindsay.
- Go.

390
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:37,720
Dean! Was someone at the door?

391
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:42,492
- Rory!
- Oh, hi, May. How you doing?

392
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:44,797
- Oh, fine. Can't complain.
- Good.

393
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:47,699
Dean's father's in the basement. He says hello.

394
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:48,923
Oh, hello back.

395
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,787
- I like the... ficus.
- Thank you.

396
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:57,986
We're done with dinner. But if you're hungry, I could scrounge up something to zap.

397
00:17:58,181 --> 00:17:59,409
I'm fine, thank you.

398
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:01,365
- We're gonna go upstairs.
- All right.

399
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:03,127
- Bye.
- Bye.

400
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,088
It's your old room.

401
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,562
In all its glory.

402
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,001
Taking up dressmaking?

403
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:13,024
Yeah, I am.

404
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:15,783
Vroom.

405
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,840
I thought they'd gotten rid of all that stuff by now.

406
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:24,877
Sorry.

407
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,897
- What?!
- It's too loud.

408
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,299
No, it isn't.

409
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,629
Turn it down or I'm gonna come over and do it myself.

410
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,558
You should really get her some Ramones.

411
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,251
Hey, um... I'm sorry about my mom.

412
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:41,787
This whole thing's been kind of a surprise to my parents.

413
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:44,168
I mean, Dad's hardly left the basement.

414
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:46,479
That's okay. It's gonna take time for everybody.

415
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:50,025
- What?!
- Turn it back down!

416
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,728
The college student and the divorc�.

417
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,166
We'd make a good adult film.

418
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:06,118
Dean?

419
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:07,409
What, Mom?

420
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,713
Just wondering how late Rory's gonna be here.

421
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:11,638
I don't know exactly.

422
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:14,945
Because I want to set the alarm before Dad and I go to bed.

423
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:17,055
If the front door opens, it'll set it off.

424
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:20,623
Uh, I'll turn it on when she leaves, Mom.

425
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:25,907
Okay. It's just that that will make the alarm panel in the bedroom chirp. That wakes us.

426
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:28,765
Well, Clara's stereo is gonna keep you awake anyways, Mom.

427
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:30,371
I turned it down.

428
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,577
Just as long as Rory doesn't stay too late, okay, Dean?

429
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:34,637
Okay, Mom.

430
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:35,789
Okay.

431
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:47,360
We could go to a movie.

432
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:50,730
I'd love that, but it's, like, 8:30 already. I have classes.

433
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:51,524
Right.

434
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:53,556
And you're not hungry?

435
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:54,717
Not really.

436
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,358
Want to watch TV?

437
00:19:59,192 --> 00:19:59,977
Sure.

438
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:13,190
It takes a few minutes to warm up.

439
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,527
Oh, no problem.

440
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,272
So good to meet you. And see you at the polls!

441
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,626
Hey, aren't you two handy with a knife and fork.

442
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:33,400
Cute kids. Yeah! There you go. Hi. Good morning. Go, Jackson.

443
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,128
Well, when it comes to noise pollution, Jackson Belleville hears you loud and clear.

444
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,372
That's right. Thank you so much for your time, and we'll see you at the polls.

445
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:45,002
Okay, I think I can make it through the G's before my phone gives out.

446
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:46,430
- I got mine right here.
- Great.

447
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:50,748
Ladies, I offer myself up to you and your cause.

448
00:20:51,023 --> 00:20:51,740
What's this?

449
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:54,192
I took it upon myself to poll the town,

450
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,814
and I think you're gonna be pretty happy with the results.

451
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:59,486
- We are?
- Jackson is solidly in the lead.

452
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,478
Already? We just started bugging people.

453
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:03,792
Well, I modeled my poll after the Gallup poll.

454
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:07,929
The Gallup poll uses a sample of 1,005 voters to represent

455
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:10,812
the 280 million people of the United States.

456
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:16,823
Using that logic, the correct sampling size of the town of Stars Hollow would be 0.002.

457
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:20,458
Rounding that up means one person needs to be polled, so I picked me.

458
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:21,815
You polled yourself?

459
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,371
I was right there. Seemed like a perfect opportunity.

460
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:28,186
Okay. Well, first of all, thank you for dressing up to talk to yourself.

461
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:32,224
And secondly, I think you're gonna need to poll more people to get a better sense of where we really are.

462
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:34,867
Oh. Okay, I'll see what I can do.

463
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:35,746
Thanks, Kirk.

464
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:39,709
You did notice that the back of his pants are shorter than the front?

465
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,343
- How does that happen?
- That's Kirk.

466
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:42,884
It certainly is.

467
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,597
Hey, excuse me, but my customers aren't getting in the way of your thing here, are they?

468
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:48,295
Uh, no, they're fine.

469
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:51,558
Good. 'Cause I can kick them out or close down for you, if you like.

470
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,133
That's sweet, but we're good.

471
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:55,792
So you'll tell me if my business is in your way?

472
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:57,144
You'll be the first to know.

473
00:21:57,292 --> 00:22:00,969
Ooh, Lane. Great. Do you think your band could play at Jackson's rally next week?

474
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:04,121
It's not a lot of cash, but it's a little something and it's primetime placement.

475
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:04,916
Absolutely.

476
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:07,040
Great. Jackson picked a song, so I'll get info that to you.

477
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:07,987
Cool. Thanks.

478
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:11,459
Okay, maybe you were missing my subtle sarcasm there

479
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:13,148
when I mentioned my customers being in your way?

480
00:22:13,221 --> 00:22:16,083
- Oh, no. I didn't miss it at all.
- Get your war room outta here.

481
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,893
Hey, this is for a good cause. Taylor bugs you, too.

482
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:20,280
Yes, he bugs me.

483
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:22,901
Okay then. We're trying to get rid of your little annoyance.

484
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,454
By becoming my new little annoyance?

485
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:28,826
Oh, hey, the night of the rally, we're gonna need a sort of backstage gathering area.

486
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:31,120
- You cannot gather here.
- But it's right across from the...

487
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:33,587
- You cannot gather here.
- See, the stage is right over...

488
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:35,703
- You cannot gather here.
- Do you like my hair like this?

489
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:37,895
Yes, and you cannot gather here.

490
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:40,305
Wow. Sleeping with you is getting me nothing.

491
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:43,065
Just gather your crap up, get it out. I need the tables.

492
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,104
Quick, give me the baby.

493
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:51,826
Is he gonna sell it?

494
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,305
Oh. That's it, Davey.

495
00:22:56,752 --> 00:23:00,310
Work it, work it. Do the clapping, do the clapping.

496
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:03,889
Hmm. Very "Manchurian Candidate" of you.

497
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:07,058
Free ice cream. Come and get your free ice cream,

498
00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:11,496
compliments of Taylor Doose of "Taylor's Old-Fashioned Soda Shoppe And Candy Store".

499
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:16,048
No need to rush, folks. There's plenty of free, fresh, handmade ice cream

500
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:19,223
for every single registered voter in Stars Hollow.

501
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:20,938
- How dirty.
- I know.

502
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:24,507
All he needed were some lying swift boat captains to complete the ambush.

503
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:25,530
Now we're gonna lose.

504
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:29,231
No, no, now - he may have the edge, but we've got the heart.

505
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:30,609
Who the hell cares about heart?

506
00:23:30,698 --> 00:23:35,898
We do, and people will. We just have to stay focused and do this one vote at a time.

507
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,635
Who are you calling? Ben Affleck?

508
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:42,038
- Oh, hello, my favorite daughter.
- What do you need?

509
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,218
- I need you to come home.
- Now?

510
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:46,103
- No, Tuesday.
- What's on Tuesday?

511
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,626
Well, it's the town selectman elections, and we're desperate.

512
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:51,817
Lane's band is playing, and I'll give you a button.

513
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:53,066
- I'll be there.
- Really?

514
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:54,863
Yeah. You know I'm a sucker for a good button.

515
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:57,050
- Thanks, kid.
- Tell Jackson I'm rooting for him.

516
00:23:57,116 --> 00:24:00,951
- I will. Um, so, how's school?
- So far, so good.

517
00:24:01,003 --> 00:24:01,991
And how's Paris?

518
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:05,452
Asher left her a 300-pound antique printing press, which she put in the common room.

519
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:06,942
- So, same?
- Exactly.

520
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,907
Great. Okay. And, um...

521
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:11,919
how's Dean?

522
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:13,378
He's fine.

523
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,450
Okay, well, good.

524
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,386
Mom, I have to study. I'll see you Tuesday, okay?

525
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:18,703
Okay, see you Tuesday.

526
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:25,674
Okay, so Rory's coming back to vote. So counting her, you, me, Jackson, and Kirk, that's five.

527
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:27,852
- Why did you say "how's Dean?" like that?
- Like that?

528
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:29,372
"How's Dean?"

529
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:30,930
- I did say it like that, didn't I?
- Yep.

530
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:35,567
I don't know. I think I'm trying so hard to make Rory think I'm totally cool with the situation

531
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:38,547
that I end up sounding totally freaked out by the situation.

532
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:40,258
You're totally cool with the situation?

533
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:44,440
Well, I'm totally on my way to being totally cool with the situation.

534
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,460
Here. Take him. He's politically useless to me.

535
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:07,677
- Oow!
- Sorry.

536
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,160
- Oh, that's okay.
- You sure?

537
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:11,270
Yeah. I'm good. Just, um...

538
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:14,337
- Wait.
- What?

539
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:15,647
My hair.

540
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:20,144
- Okay. Is that...
- Yeah, yeah. That's good.

541
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:24,157
- Damn it.
- Let's just shift here.

542
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:26,589
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to get your seat back.

543
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:27,746
Oh, I can do that.

544
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:34,507
Oh! See, good, okay. So I'll just get, like, up here, and then now...

545
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,066
This isn't working great.

546
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,217
Sorry.

547
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:49,645
Yeah.

548
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,083
So...

549
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:53,751
what do you want to do?

550
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:57,642
I don't know.

551
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:02,563
- We could try going to your house or...
- No, my parents are there.

552
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:07,493
Right. We could go to Luke's. He's dating my mom now, so I get seated right away.

553
00:26:07,595 --> 00:26:08,998
I don't want to go to Luke's.

554
00:26:09,143 --> 00:26:11,252
Okay, then, I'm out. Your turn.

555
00:26:12,777 --> 00:26:14,523
Maybe you should just take me home.

556
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,231
Oh, okay.

557
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:23,785
You know, Lane's band is playing at Jackson's rally, and I thought

558
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:26,586
maybe I'd come back to town to see it. Maybe we could go together.

559
00:26:26,657 --> 00:26:29,104
- No, I don't think so.
- It would be fun.

560
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:31,379
- At the least, it could be very loud.
- No, Rory!

561
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:34,363
- I don't want to go parading our relationship all over town.
- I didn't say...

562
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:37,277
I don't need to rub Lindsay's nose in it any more than I already have, okay?

563
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:42,565
I wasn't trying to rub Lindsay's nose in anything. I was just...

564
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:45,965
I'll take you home.

565
00:26:52,836 --> 00:26:53,728
Hello?

566
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,346
- Rory?
- Yep.

567
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:59,825
- Hey. Did I know you were coming home?
- Nope.

568
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:01,684
That's a nice face.

569
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:04,327
I don't feel like driving all the way back to school tonight.

570
00:27:04,526 --> 00:27:07,618
I have to deal with James Joyce first thing in the morning. Is that okay?

571
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:09,534
The crashing or the dealing with James Joyce?

572
00:27:09,604 --> 00:27:11,663
- Crashing.
- Absolutely. Crash away.

573
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,654
- Need a helmet?
- Just a pillow.

574
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:19,057
So, just curious, what brings you to this neck of the woods this fine evening?

575
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:21,145
Dean had to give Lindsay the car tonight.

576
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:24,109
So I came here to see him.

577
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,204
Well, you're a good girlfriend.

578
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,222
Well, it just made sense. I mean, I have a car.

579
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:30,223
And classes first thing in the morning.

580
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:30,980
What?

581
00:27:31,268 --> 00:27:32,087
What'd you say?

582
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:34,264
I said, "who wants Pop-Tarts?"

583
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:42,859
Oh, my God. Come on. How long is this taking you?

584
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,153
We do not harass the voters. This is not Florida.

585
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,270
I just voted for my husband. Gimme that sticker.

586
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:53,478
When I married him, I never thought that someday he'd go into politics.

587
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,518
Of course, his winning the line-dance championship was also a bit of a shocker,

588
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:58,923
so what the hell do I know?

589
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:01,163
Gee, I wonder who I just voted for.

590
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:05,362
Ah, this is a wonderful night. Thank you.

591
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:10,144
Sookie, I just want to say good luck, and may the best man win.

592
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:11,593
Yeah, you too, Taylor.

593
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:16,902
You know what - this has been fun, even if we lose.

594
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:19,483
- We're not gonna lose.
- Even if we do, I'm still glad we did it.

595
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:22,252
We're not going to lose. What's up with you? You taking off?

596
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,404
I'm gonna see Lane's band, then I'm gonna go.

597
00:28:24,459 --> 00:28:26,405
And I'm gonna make stew for Jackson.

598
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:28,458
When he loses, he'll get stew. He likes stew.

599
00:28:28,545 --> 00:28:29,437
He's not gonna lose.

600
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:32,033
- Okay. But if he does...
- then he'll get stew.

601
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:54,596
- This is the day the music died.
- Seals & Crofts rock harder than this.

602
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:57,827
- My mom likes this song.
- It's the song Jackson picked.

603
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:59,916
- We have to play it.
- And then leave town immediately,

604
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:02,513
because there's no way we can ever show our faces around here again.

605
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,570
We could wear masks. They wouldn't know it was us.

606
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,158
Dude, they wreak havoc with your hair.

607
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:07,044
And where would we get 'em?

608
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,582
My parents have a collection of wooden tiki masks they've picked up on trips.

609
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:11,430
They're pretty cool. We'd have to peel the price tags off.

610
00:29:11,523 --> 00:29:13,745
I'm not wearing smelly wood on my face.

611
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:15,138
Well then, you come up with something.

612
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:17,503
I say we walk because otherwise we're selling out.

613
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:19,741
We're already backstage. People will see us.

614
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:21,143
Not if we wear tiki masks.

615
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:22,839
It's worth it to keep our street cred.

616
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:24,481
Look, Zach, it's for a good cause.

617
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,204
And if, for one night, we have to give up our cool and not have girls jiggling up and down,

618
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:30,744
wanting to come back to our place for sucker beer, then so be it.

619
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,267
Whoa, Prohibition Sally. Part of the point of all this is appealing to chicks.

620
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,365
- For you, not for us.
- No, for me, too.

621
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:38,649
- That's how I met my wife.
- Well, then, not for me.

622
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:40,927
- Well, you're a chick.
- Right, so I should know.

623
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:43,058
I don't even know what you're talking about anymore.

624
00:29:43,136 --> 00:29:45,191
- We can't cancel the gig.
- Then what do we do?

625
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:46,529
We do what we do.

626
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:48,214
We make rock 'n' roll.

627
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:51,520
Hendrix rocked Woodstock with "The Star Spangled banner. "

628
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:53,143
- That's true.
- No one saw it coming.

629
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,530
It's a classic now. He turned it into an anthem.

630
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:58,085
It's "The Star Spangled Banner. " It was kind of already an anthem.

631
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,097
- Thanks to Hendrix.
- I'm confused.

632
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:00,952
So am I.

633
00:30:01,018 --> 00:30:03,025
- Are we walking or what?
- We're not walking.

634
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,562
Okay, I gotta get out of here. I'm going upstairs.

635
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,849
I put out the coffee, I locked the storeroom and the fridge.

636
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:15,641
Do not let anyone break anything or steal anything. And lock up when you're done.

637
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:17,536
You really don't want to wait for the results?

638
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:19,148
I'm just afraid I'll get too emotional.

639
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:20,224
Good night.

640
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:22,846
You want some more coffee?

641
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:23,973
Bye, hon.

642
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:27,008
- How you doing, honey?
- Oh, I'm fine.

643
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,507
He's nervous. I can tell. His neck goes away.

644
00:30:29,574 --> 00:30:31,033
I'm not nervous. I'm fine.

645
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,536
Where are they? Where are they? Oh, there you are.

646
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:35,968
- You won't believe it. Big news.
- Kirk, sit down.

647
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:39,185
Can't. These aren't my pants. I have the results of my latest poll.

648
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:44,709
I talked to every single person in town, and unanimously, they're all voting for Jackson.

649
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,969
- What?
- Are you sure?

650
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:48,308
I am sure. I talked to everyone except Taylor -

651
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,585
but I assumed he was voting for himself - and they all told me the same thing.

652
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:55,609
We're going to win? I'm gonna be the first town selectman lady.

653
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:56,718
I can't believe it.

654
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:58,363
Kirk, you're sure about this? Every single person?

655
00:30:58,425 --> 00:30:59,669
Every person except Taylor -

656
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:02,506
and even that's not a lock, 'cause hatred for Taylor runs very deep.

657
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:04,666
Ooh, the rally started. Come on.

658
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:07,329
Ooh, I'm so excited! I don't have to make stew!

659
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:47,752
Lane.

660
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,044
- You're here!
- Hey, I'm your groupie.

661
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,623
But don't get any ideas. I'm saving experimentation for my junior year.

662
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,392
I love you.

663
00:31:58,468 --> 00:32:00,690
If you need someone to stage-dive, give me a signal.

664
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:01,516
You got it.

665
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:05,054
Hello, Stars Hollow!

666
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:06,200
Hello!

667
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:12,431
Okay, so the man of the hour, Jackson Belleville - Oh. That's nice. Okay.

668
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:15,836
Well, he's getting ready to come out here and talk to you, but before he does,

669
00:32:15,948 --> 00:32:19,245
I wanted to take the opportunity to say thanks -

670
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:23,158
Wow. Again, wow.

671
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:26,676
Okay, so thanks for all of the support and the nice thoughts.

672
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:31,324
This is a great place to live, and I wouldn't want to live anyplace else the world!

673
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,215
And now let's get this party started. I've got a real treat for you tonight.

674
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:39,731
Right here, live onstage, playing one of Jackson's favorite songs of all time,

675
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,893
put your hands together, and let's build the roof for Hep Alien!

676
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:49,587
One, two, three, four...

677
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:38,074
- It's different live, I guess.
- I just saw Taylor in the soda shop.

678
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:40,096
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I think he knows.

679
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:42,171
- Knows what?
- Knows that he's gonna lose.

680
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:42,954
Really?

681
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:46,199
He was sitting there all alone in the dark, downing spray whipped cream.

682
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,022
- He looked devastated.
- Yay!

683
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,603
I know - "yay. " But it's kind of sad, isn't it?

684
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:53,787
- Why? He deserves it.
- I know, but no votes?

685
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:57,448
None? That's humiliating. That's "Swept Away" kind of humiliating.

686
00:33:57,597 --> 00:33:59,357
Yeah, you're right. Too bad.

687
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:02,189
You're stilling "yaying" in your head, aren't you?

688
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:04,062
In 5.1 surround.

689
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,583
I'll be back in a minute.

690
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,615
Oh, Andrew. Great. Hi.

691
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,904
Hi Lorelai. Looks like it's gonna be a landslide for Jackson.

692
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,307
Every single person I know is voting for him. You must be really happy.

693
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,953
Oh, yes, I am. Could you, um, vote for Taylor?

694
00:34:35,024 --> 00:34:35,618
What?

695
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,686
Jackson's still gonna win. It's hard to explain.

696
00:34:37,753 --> 00:34:40,149
It involves spray cream. Just trust me. Great. Thanks.

697
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:43,744
- Anna, hi!
- Hi, Lorelai. Big night, huh?

698
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,004
Oh, yeah, real big. Could you vote for Taylor?

699
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:27,730
Well, that was peppy.

700
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:31,022
All right, ladies and gentlemen, what you've all been waiting for -

701
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:35,190
the man of the hour, the next town selectman of Stars Hollow,

702
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:37,652
Jackson Belleville!

703
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,161
Well, jeez. That was, uh... quite a welcome.

704
00:35:56,361 --> 00:36:02,296
Uh, thank you all for coming and supporting me in this...

705
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,071
thing here.

706
00:36:04,481 --> 00:36:07,554
As I stand on this stage, looking at you all,

707
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:10,135
I can't help but think...

708
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:13,216
I have a job.

709
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:16,263
I have a life.

710
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,811
I don't have time to be selectman.

711
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:24,015
I have a business. I have a kid.

712
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:26,702
And Sookie and I are trying to have another one.

713
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,409
And the doctor has us on this schedule, and it's not flexible.

714
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:33,256
And - what was I thinking?

715
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,221
What the hell am I doing here?

716
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:38,777
I don't want to be selectman.

717
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:43,666
- An honest man!
- Finally!

718
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:46,328
We're behind you all the way, Jackson!

719
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:50,736
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!...

720
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:02,026
Whoo! Whoo! Oh, man, I am flying.

721
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,458
I mean it, I am two, three feet in the air.

722
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:06,239
It was tight, it was tight.

723
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,534
That's the right term to throw in at this point, right?

724
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:11,037
No one plays guitar like you, Zach.

725
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:11,842
Totally.

726
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:15,420
It was more than just the gifts, sweetheart. It was the material.

727
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:16,571
We found our sound.

728
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,035
Cheese works. This is a turning point. We have to go for it.

729
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,959
You are gonna be so famous.

730
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,513
- Will you remember us when you're huge?
- No.

731
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:28,829
- You're awful.
- I'm awful, too.

732
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:33,574
- Okay, who needs refills?
- I do.

733
00:37:33,638 --> 00:37:34,732
- Me too.
- I'm good.

734
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:40,768
- Grab us a couple beers, would you?
- Okay.

735
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:44,487
What are you doing in here? Come and join the party.

736
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:50,615
I like you, Zach.

737
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:53,365
I like you as more than a bandmate and more than a friend.

738
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,767
I like you. I have liked you for some time now, and I don't think this feeling is going to go away.

739
00:37:57,824 --> 00:37:59,098
I just thought you should know.

740
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:00,440
Here's your beer.

741
00:38:12,104 --> 00:38:13,303
I gotta get some air.

742
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,703
I have Ken Burns' "Jazz" on DVD, if you're into that kind of thing.

743
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,055
Hey.

744
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:29,072
Hey. I didn't know you were coming.

745
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,301
I'm so sorry.

746
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,472
It's okay.

747
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:34,512
This who situation's turning out to be a lot harder than I thought.

748
00:38:34,576 --> 00:38:38,750
Not you - just Lindsay and moving back home and my parents.

749
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:42,139
I'm not handling it as well as I should be.

750
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:44,226
It's a lot, Dean. You're doing fine.

751
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,712
I didn't want to yell at you like that.

752
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:48,599
I worked out the car thing. That's not gonna be an issue anymore.

753
00:38:49,117 --> 00:38:54,579
I hope. And I had a little talk with my mom, so I think things are gonna be better now.

754
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:55,279
Okay.

755
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:03,391
- I'm sorry.
- It's good. Don't worry about it.

756
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:11,246
- Dean, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

757
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:14,005
- You won't get mad?
- No, I promise.

758
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,828
If Lindsay hadn't found that letter...

759
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,124
would you...

760
00:39:21,753 --> 00:39:23,237
um, were you going...

761
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,503
would you still have left her?

762
00:39:27,808 --> 00:39:28,649
Yeah.

763
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:34,311
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

764
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:37,958
Okay. Good.

765
00:39:39,815 --> 00:39:42,980
Everybody, may I have your attention? The results are in.

766
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:45,596
Jackson, come on out here.

767
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:54,822
Okay. The votes for town selectman are as follows - 1,114 for Jackson Belleville.

768
00:39:56,221 --> 00:39:58,559
10 for Taylor Doose.

769
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:01,954
Well, we have a new town selectman, ladies and gentlemen!

770
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:06,941
Jackson, would you like to say a few words to your constituency?

771
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:08,585
No.

772
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:10,044
I would.

773
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:34,553
Friends and townspeople... today in Stars Hollow, democracy has spoken.

774
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:39,305
The will of the people has prevailed, and new leadership has been instated.

775
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:41,303
Your vote has counted.

776
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:44,175
Free elections are a wonderful thing,

777
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:48,106
a thing to be admired and cherished.

778
00:40:49,018 --> 00:40:53,359
Here in America, we have something else that is to be admired and cherished.

779
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:56,349
It's called a recall election.

780
00:40:57,035 --> 00:41:03,481
I look forward to this other aspect of democracy, which I believe will happen any day now,

781
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:07,905
when sanity and reason have been restored to Stars Hollow.

782
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:11,265
So, in closing, friends, believe me when I tell you,

783
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:15,260
you will have Taylor Doose to kick around again.

784
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,137
Thank you, and God bless.

785
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:27,822
Jackson, now that we're done with the sidewalk issue,

786
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:32,482
I would like to talk to you about the permit for expanding my dance studio to include a Tae-Bo room.

787
00:41:32,544 --> 00:41:34,350
I have the pictures of the hedges right here.

788
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:37,484
They're at least a foot above where they're supposed to be, and ruby won't cut them down.

789
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:41,012
If you need someone in charge of homeland security, I am your man.

790
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:43,988
I have this great idea...

791
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:47,069
The sun sets five minutes earlier for me 'cause her hedges are in the way.

792
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:05,404
Hey.

793
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,810
Grabbed us a little victory champagne, and I thought -

794
00:42:09,515 --> 00:42:10,867
- you were asleep.
- Oh, no, no.

795
00:42:10,974 --> 00:42:14,696
- I was just doing some bills and things.
- Doing bills?

796
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:15,694
- Yeah.
- In the dark?

797
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:17,149
Trying to - conserve.

798
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:21,557
So, when you went up earlier, you were going to bed.

799
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,869
You go to bed early, which makes sense, because you get up early.

800
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,517
And, ugh - now I got it.

801
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:31,562
Hey, it's no big deal. Just come on in, Lorelai...

802
00:42:33,365 --> 00:42:36,104
- No, I can hold on to this till later.
- Yeah?

803
00:42:36,176 --> 00:42:37,927
Yeah. Good night.

804
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,967
"Goes to bed early," I gotta remember that.

805
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:42,679
- Only on some nights.
- Hey, don't you also hate champagne?

806
00:42:42,754 --> 00:42:43,680
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

807
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:46,854
I'm learning, I'm learning.
