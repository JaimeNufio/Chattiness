1
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:09,254
- More broccoli, Grandpa?
- Absolutely. Staves off the cancer.

2
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:12,366
- Staves off my appetite.
- You really should eat more green things, Lorelai.

3
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,401
I plan to eat a five-dollar bill later tonight.

4
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:17,451
Oh, have you seen the new twenties? They have a little peach color in 'em.

5
00:01:17,532 --> 00:01:20,523
Peach, perfect. I'll eat a new twenty, I'll have my fruits and vegetables.

6
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:24,118
I think we saw some of the new twenties in Atlantic City, didn't we, Emily?

7
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,425
- I think.
- How was Atlantic City? Successful?

8
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:27,164
Very.

9
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,559
- Siskel's chimed in. What about you?
- I'm refraining.

10
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:33,206
- It's a bit of a sore subject.
- We'll talk about something else.

11
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,697
- The garishness, the garishness.
- Thus spake Ebert.

12
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:39,888
Why have a simple sign if it can be in bright flashing neon?

13
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:44,363
And the new slot machines? They don't just make obnoxious bell sounds anymore, they yell at you.

14
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,819
The slot machines were talking to you, Mom? Are you sure it wasn't just you?

15
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:48,668
Oh, they talk, I can verify that.

16
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,089
One of them kept yelling, "wheel... of... fortune!"

17
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:55,985
And the parking lot of the hotel that we stayed at had an area for RV's.

18
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,003
- Perish the thought!
- And the boardwalk...

19
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,975
- Oh, I've always wanted to see the Atlantic City boardwalk.
- I'll save you a trip.

20
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,950
Tip an overflowing trash can on your front porch and walk up and down on it.

21
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:07,274
It was actually quite a successful outing.

22
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,130
- Maybe not to our taste, but the clients loved it.
- The clients were too plastered to know better.

23
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:15,775
- Kind of the point.
- Two of them stayed up all night and smelled like it.

24
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:18,806
- That was a tad gross.
- One of them - a married man -

25
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:25,053
had a long conversation with... how shall I put this delicately? A woman of less than reputable nature.

26
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:26,988
Do hookers charge to let you talk to them?

27
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:29,347
- Depends on what they're doing when they're talking to you.
- Rory!

28
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:32,359
- Sorry.
- I expect that from your mother, but not you.

29
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:35,733
- Just a joke.
- Yeah, Mom, Yale is broadening her world view.

30
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:39,415
- Digger was in his element.
- You mean Jason was in his element.

31
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:42,242
- He caroused along with the best of them.
- You carouse any, Dad?

32
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,888
I played a little craps, but the tables were ice-cold.

33
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:47,796
What's the next outing Jason has planned for your clients, Richard?

34
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,914
Spring break in Cancï¿½n so you can do shots off people's bellies?

35
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:53,232
- I'm uncomfortable hearing you say that.
- Me, too.

36
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:56,899
I can assure you, Emily, that there are no belly shots in our future.

37
00:02:57,017 --> 00:03:00,136
Although doing one off Dad's belly is okay. You're married.

38
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:02,910
And those gifts. Those heinous gifts he gave out.

39
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:06,432
Oh, we had little roulette wheels printed up with our company name on them.

40
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:11,435
They were a big hit. Perfect for an executive's table. I got one for each of you.

41
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:14,230
- Richard, don't, it's embarrassing.
- They're cute.

42
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,606
They're the antithesis of class - so like Digger.

43
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:20,084
Emily, that was his nickname as a boy, and he's sensitive about it.

44
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:23,984
- I've never called him that to his face.
- You did at that craps table, and then he sevened out.

45
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:26,340
Please, let's discuss something other than New Jersey.

46
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:27,757
I am more than willing.

47
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:31,490
Hey, have you guys read any of Rory's articles in the Yale newspaper?

48
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,537
- Of course, we've read them all.
- Fine work, Rory.

49
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:37,763
- The Yale Daily News is lucky to have you.
- Oh, it's really not a big deal.

50
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,342
- Hey, they're right. Take your props.
- You'll be running that paper before long.

51
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:43,517
- I'm not even on staff yet.
- You're not?

52
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:45,827
These are just tryout articles to qualify.

53
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:50,342
You have to write something for every department, and then if those pass muster, then you're on staff.

54
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,173
Well, your coverage of that lacrosse match was very exciting.

55
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,917
Yeah. For two seconds, I almost gave a flying you-know-what about lacrosse.

56
00:03:56,983 --> 00:04:01,048
I liked your coverage on the new funds approved for upkeep on the divinity quadrangle.

57
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,669
- You made it sing.
- We're having all your articles laminated.

58
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,548
- That's very nice.
- Yes!

59
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:08,596
I got my number.

60
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:11,848
It just seems like a quaint archaism. I mean, if you're a good journalist,

61
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:15,723
why make you jump through hoops and write all these tryout articles? Stale bagel.

62
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:18,300
It's a time-honored tradition. All our forebears had to do it.

63
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:20,753
If our forebears had fought it, we wouldn't be dealing with it now.

64
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:22,586
- What are you looking for?
- My article.

65
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,517
- I did a review of the chamber-music recital.
- Must be in there somewhere.

66
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:29,825
- And that's the other thing... they print everything.
- That's weird.

67
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,856
- They'd print my mattress tag if it was in the right margins.
- It's not here.

68
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:35,125
- Impossible.
- No, I've looked pretty thoroughly.

69
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:37,403
- Must be a mistake.
- No, it's really not here.

70
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:41,263
Just means parakeets will be crapping on something else in the morning. They're all stale.

71
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,663
- Morning. Morning.
- Hi, Doyle.

72
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,055
- Hi, Rory. Coffee mint?
- No, thanks.

73
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:50,920
I'm addicted to these things. So is Bob Woodward. So I hear... not that I'm copying him. What's up?

74
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:53,885
Well, I was wondering if there was a problem with my review.

75
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:55,972
Oh, the review? Which was yours, the quartet?

76
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:58,538
- Yeah, chamber music at Sprague Hall.
- Right, right.

77
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:01,555
- Did I get it in late?
- No, you got it in right on time. You're good about that.

78
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,290
- But you didn't print it.
- No, we didn't.

79
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:05,702
- So, space issue?
- No, we had the space.

80
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:09,542
- We always have the space, but it was a bit of a yawn.
- A yawn?

81
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:15,384
Well, you know, chamber-music recitals are very low-key, kind of yawny affairs.

82
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,584
- Pretty music but no stage diving or anything.
- I meant the writing.

83
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,571
- The writing was kind of a yawn?
- But don't sweat it. You'll do better next time.

84
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,767
- Right, sure.
- My mother liked it.

85
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:27,379
- Liked what?
- The recital. She's old. Excuse me.

86
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:28,742
Sure. Sure.

87
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,532
- Your article didn't get in?
- No, it didn't.

88
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:39,217
Mine did. Good, good. I'm going to get a bagel.

89
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:44,967
- He actually used the word yawn?
- Yes.

90
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:46,856
- What a jerk.
- You should punch him where it counts.

91
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:49,555
- He was just doing his job.
- He could have been a little more diplomatic.

92
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:53,210
- The word yawn is insulting.
- Yeah, but I was actually tired when I wrote it,

93
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:57,593
so it probably wasn't my best work. I should write my articles at night first, then study.

94
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:01,746
- I still say Yawn Guy needs a little learnin'.
- Yeah, kick him where the sun don't shine.

95
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:05,054
- You really are not good at threats.
- I know, and I hate that.

96
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,722
- I'll just chalk it up to experience.
- Hey, what time do you have?

97
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:11,372
- Five to four.
- Five minutes to my call with Dave. I should get home.

98
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,650
- Hey, are we still mad at him?
- We never were.

99
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:16,031
That's right. Must be Jackson.

100
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:18,271
- We're mad at Jackson for something he said to Sookie.
- No, we're not.

101
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:19,871
- You sure?
- Yes.

102
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,616
- Must be Gypsy. We're mad at her husband?
- She's not married.

103
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,380
- This is gonna bug me.
- So, how is Dave?

104
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:27,756
He's great. I just wish he weren't three thousand miles away.

105
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:30,268
How did he take the news that you found a replacement for him in the band?

106
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,501
- He was a little weird about it.
- And that's why we're mad at him.

107
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,418
- We're not mad at Dave.
- Must be Jackson.

108
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,380
- I miss that boy.
- Well, he'll be home for Christmas, right?

109
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:40,720
- He better.
- This is my stop.

110
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:43,669
- Say hi to the baby for me.
- Find out who we're mad at.

111
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,203
- We're not mad at anybody.
- We're always mad at somebody.

112
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:54,888
- Hey. Door's open. Aren't they home?
- They are home. I'm not welcome in it.

113
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,704
- What?
- Lorelai, come on in.

114
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:59,771
I'm being discriminated against. Go, enjoy.

115
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:01,149
- Michel can't come in?
- Nope.

116
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,816
- I'm Rosa Parks.
- Why can't Rosa Parks come in?

117
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:06,008
- He sneezed.
- Five days ago.

118
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:10,370
- I can't take a chance with the baby.
- It's a business meeting. The baby should not attend.

119
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:12,756
He's a week old. What should he do, take in a movie?

120
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:16,585
I got dust up my nose. It made me sneeze. I am not sick.

121
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:18,910
- Come on in.
- Sorry.

122
00:08:21,671 --> 00:08:22,822
Not funny.

123
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:29,104
There he is. Oh, widdle Davey, widdle Davey, peekaboo, peekaboo.

124
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:33,129
Oh, you have a widdle nose. Oh, oh, no, Aunt Lorelai's got your nose.

125
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,982
Do you want it back? Do you? Do you?

126
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,863
- He's not indicating that he wants it back.
- Well, then, I'm going to keep it.

127
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:43,046
- This is painful.
- You know, he said his first word this morning.

128
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,439
Who? Michel?

129
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:47,609
- What'd he say?
- He said, "ah-oopah."

130
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,854
Did you say, "ah-oopah"? Did you?

131
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:53,240
Well, you're very talented. Did you know that?

132
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:57,305
If I throw up, do you want it on the bushes or the grass?

133
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,531
- Michel, don't you like babies?
- I don't know. I've never been near one.

134
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:03,245
- I thought today was my chance.
- I brought pastries.

135
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,021
- Excellent.
- Do you want one, Michel?

136
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:08,400
So I can look even sadder, sitting and eating pastry by myself?

137
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:11,073
- No, thank you. Can we start?
- Okay.

138
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:16,741
Well, I'm here to report that the Dragonfly is officially demoed and stripped to its studs,

139
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:21,062
to the point where it looks worse than ever and you can't imagine it ever looking good ever again.

140
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,680
- Excellent.
- There are big, flying things out here.

141
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:26,146
But we're on schedule, and when I left, the plumbing contractor

142
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:30,038
was unloading all sorts of impressive-looking copper pipes, so that's something, I guess, and...

143
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:32,199
- Oh, Bruce.
- Hello.

144
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:34,837
- I thought you'd gone.
- I came back.

145
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:38,644
- Well, there you go.
- Bruce is not only a midwife, she's also a lactation specialist.

146
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:39,623
Yikes.

147
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:43,319
- Is that the sneezer?
- It was dust.

148
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,023
What are these big green things with wings?

149
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:50,231
You know, Bruce, I didn't get a chance to tell you how impressed I was

150
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:54,297
by the home birth. It was just amazing to watch and very, very special.

151
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,734
- Did you talk baby talk to Davey?
- Yes.

152
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:59,591
Every second Davey's brain is hard-wiring for life.

153
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:03,538
Baby talk can retard his language-acquisition rate. Is that what you want?

154
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:05,740
Definitely not. I want him fully tarded.

155
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:10,046
- This flying green thing is toying with me.
- In five minutes, we'll feed.

156
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:15,761
Five minutes. Did I tell you she donates her services to indigent, inner-city mothers?

157
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:20,435
- It's okay.
- All right, this thing is getting ready to dive-bomb.

158
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:24,367
So, Davey, beautiful day, huh? What would you like to discuss?

159
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,876
Middle East peace, the space program? I'm sorry, what's that?

160
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,053
Oh, my God. He said, "the answer to the problems in the mideast is, 'I have to poop.'"

161
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,423
- He got distracted.
- And now there's no peace?

162
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:39,522
Davey, come on, man, hard-wire those adult thoughts and try to remember what we're talking...

163
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,520
and he said that Thursday's impossible to start work and I reminded him about our contract.

164
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:47,888
- Good, because he needed to be reminded.
- So that's all taken care of.

165
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:51,821
- I'm being attacked by green things!
- It's time to feed.

166
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:57,744
- Well, this has been a very productive meeting.
- Very.

167
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:03,494
- Hi, Doyle. Got something for you.
- Your new review?

168
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:06,192
- My new review.
- Remember "The New Zoo Revue"?

169
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,241
- Henrietta hippo?
- Freddie the frog,

170
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:09,946
- and who was the third one? What was the third one?
- I'm drawing a blank.

171
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:14,471
Oh, I hate that. Whenever there's three of something, you always forget the third one. It's like a statistical thing.

172
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,412
- Do you want me to come back?
- No, let's look at it now.

173
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,027
So I drank a lot of coffee before writing this, so hopefully it won't be a yawn.

174
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:21,055
Good.

175
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,575
- Doyle.
- Just a sec.

176
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,659
- You're crossing everything out.
- Not everything.

177
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:33,717
The only thing you haven't crossed out is what you haven't read yet.

178
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:34,906
Hold on, hold on, okay?

179
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,537
Well, it's better than your last one. You're showing progress.

180
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:42,632
- Really.
- Okay, is this some kind of hazing?

181
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:45,022
- Hazing?
- I put a lot of time into this.

182
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,138
Oh, I know. It's definitely not for lack of trying.

183
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,733
Is it something personal? Did I do something to offend you?

184
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,025
No, Rory, this is how it works. It's not personal. It's just not very good.

185
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,786
I rewrote it four times, and I researched it so thoroughly.

186
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:59,072
Don't worry about the facts. You seem to have gotten those right. Stan, file this for me.

187
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,403
- So, it's not good?
- I just couldn't tell what you really thought.

188
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:05,421
- But I tried so hard.
- Oh, I know.

189
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:08,826
- So I should try less hard?
- Look, just write what you think.

190
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:10,454
- You have opinions, don't you?
- Sure, I do.

191
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:12,015
- That's what will work.
- Sounds simple.

192
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:15,160
It can be. Charlie the owl. That's the third one.

193
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,569
Right, right, Charlie. Guess I'll go.

194
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,987
Don't worry. Either you'll get the hang of things or you won't.

195
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:25,677
Just make sure this one's good.

196
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,268
Got it.

197
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:35,932
- Wow, pretty. Yale's got the big bucks, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

198
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:37,452
- This is gonna be fun.
- It's work for me.

199
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:41,610
Are those our seats, all saved and everything?

200
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,436
- One of the advantages of being with the press.
- Are you okay?

201
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,846
Yeah, I'm the happiest unpublished writer in the newspaper biz.

202
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:51,004
- You are not unpublished.
- I am recently unpublished.

203
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,325
Don't forget your lacrosse-story triumph.

204
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:55,884
Yeah, maybe lacrosse is the only thing I'm good at writing about,

205
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,916
- and I'd never heard of it before I was assigned it.
- Now, come on.

206
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:02,939
Hopefully, there will be plenty of well-paid, full-time lacrosse-writing positions for me

207
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:06,574
- at the major news organizations.
- You need chocolate.

208
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:08,735
- Chocolate and talent.
- Stop that.

209
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:11,653
Maybe I'm just not cut out for college journalism.

210
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:15,489
Maybe I peaked in high school. Aw, man, that's a depressing thought.

211
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,216
You didn't peak. This is just a different environment and a bigger league,

212
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:21,946
- and that's half the fun, isn't it?
- Kind of.

213
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:26,749
- Here we go.
- Ah, I love these seats. They're so important.

214
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:35,708
Well, she recovered quickly.

215
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,290
The floor must be slippery.

216
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:47,325
I don't think the guy is supposed to wince when he lifts the ballerina.

217
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:48,713
Maybe it was involuntary?

218
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:52,546
- She wasn't supposed to kick him like that, was she?
- I don't think so.

219
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,426
It gives new meaning to the word nutcracker.

220
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:07,188
- That was terrible.
- From the opening kerplunk.

221
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,562
- And just kept getting worse.
- I'm in physical discomfort.

222
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,973
- That lead ballerina - she has no friends.
- How can you tell?

223
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:15,393
Because no one gave her the heads-up on the roll of fat around the bra strap.

224
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:20,119
- Maybe she just has no friends in the ballet.
- All ballet people do is ballet.

225
00:14:20,187 --> 00:14:22,987
If she has no friends in the ballet, she has no friends. Holy moly.

226
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:27,242
I wonder how many times I can use the word "blows" in an article before it becomes redundant.

227
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,427
- What are you gonna write?
- I don't know.

228
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,440
- What I think, I guess.
- Really.

229
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:34,958
Well, apparently, that's what was missing from my other pieces - my opinions, so...

230
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:38,121
Well, if you want my opinion, that end curtain came down way too slowly.

231
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:40,247
- I'll try to work that in.
- Man oh man.

232
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:43,482
If Vincent Gallo could just see this, he'd feel a whole lot better about "Brown Bunny."

233
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:51,357
- Nice.
- Nice?

234
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,605
- Really great job.
- Really?

235
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,972
- Really.
- Oh, wow, thanks.

236
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:58,228
- Thank you. Stan, get this to layout.
- Yeah.

237
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:00,982
- I love doing that.
- And you look good doing it.

238
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:02,764
- Coffee mint?
- Thanks.

239
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,224
This piece is beautiful. My wife's gonna flip.

240
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,915
Good. Now, it's very fragile, so keep it away from young children.

241
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:13,557
- We don't have children.
- You should. Everyone should have children.

242
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,064
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

243
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:20,257
- Lane?
- Yes, Mama?

244
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:22,609
- I have something for Dave.
- For Dave, my Dave?

245
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:25,774
Something for you to send to him in California. Special gift from me to him.

246
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,190
- Really?
- Could you wrap it and take it to the post office?

247
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:30,039
Definitely. That's so sweet, Mama.

248
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:33,450
- He's a good boy. He's going to make a good man.
- I agree.

249
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:34,775
I'm going to make some tea.

250
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,599
So, I looked up what Bruce said about baby talk and she was right.

251
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,580
- You should never talk baby talk to a baby.
- That's sad.

252
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,279
Yeah. So I've been calling all my friends and relatives with babies

253
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,282
- to tell them to immediately stop talking to them.
- You mean, stop talking baby talk?

254
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:08,016
- No, it's better that they just stop altogether.
- Ittle-bitty Michel.

255
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:11,352
- Now, stop that.
- Well, I like talking baby talk and I can't do it to babies,

256
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:15,966
so I need an outlet. And you're my outwet - wittle Michel with the happy hair.

257
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:18,182
- Goodbye.
- You no wanna eat?

258
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,924
Aw, look at him walking. Big boy walkie. Ooh.

259
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:28,465
- Nicole!
- Hi, Lorelai.

260
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:32,304
- Well, I'll be. Look at you there.
- It's nice to see you.

261
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,873
- Yeah. Does Luke know you're here?
- Yeah, he's just in the back. Do you want him?

262
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:37,301
No, I don't want him, I don't want him.

263
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,348
I was just coming in for a bite with a friend and...

264
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:43,384
not my imaginary friend. My friend Michel was with me,

265
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:47,188
but he doesn't eat normal food like this, so he's not coming in, so... you good?

266
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:49,522
- Very good. And you?
- Very good, too.

267
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:52,672
I'm just still living here in Stars Hollow, and, um, Rory's going to Yale.

268
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:54,193
- I knew that.
- Of course.

269
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:58,508
Naturally, you would be all filled in 'cause Luke's talking to you regularly, and...

270
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:05,650
So... I met a bunch of lawyers from your firm.

271
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:08,130
- Really?
- I did, yes, because, well,

272
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:12,743
- I'm... they were coming in to see Luke, and I'm in here a lot, so...
- Right. Yeah, they're good guys.

273
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,676
- Really good guys. They like you a lot.
- They're the partners at my firm.

274
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,471
Well, so they have to like you.

275
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:21,560
- So, is Luke coming out, or...
- He should be.

276
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:24,447
- You know, I'm not hungry.
- No?

277
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,515
I just remembered, I just ate.

278
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,023
- So... but it's really good to see you.
- Same here.

279
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:31,016
Really good.

280
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:33,475
Okay. So...

281
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:41,989
- Hello?
- Oh, thank God.

282
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:44,324
- Lane?
- I just had the biggest fight with Dave

283
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,271
- that we've ever had ever, and it's all my mother's fault.
- Your mother? Why?

284
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:52,382
Get this - earlier today, my mom asked me to wrap something that she wants to send to Dave.

285
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,348
- Is it his birthday?
- No, this was something else altogether.

286
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:58,122
- You holding onto your hat?
- I'm not wearing one, but I can pretend to be.

287
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:00,119
- It's the jug.
- What jug?

288
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,821
- The jug. The big jug. The monumental jug.
- What jug?

289
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:07,452
Remember when I was a kid, my mother showed me the special jug

290
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:11,987
that's been passed down in my family for years and years in a long-standing Kim tradition

291
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,624
that she is personally going to present to the boy I'm going to wed?

292
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,353
- Oh, my God. The marriage jug?
- The marriage jug.

293
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:19,928
She's sending Dave the marriage jug? What does that mean?

294
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,983
I'm guessing it means she's reserving a hall and ordering that "Stations of the Cross" ice sculpture.

295
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,319
- Whoa, this is serious.
- No kidding.

296
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:29,872
- I had forgotten all about it.
- I didn't. It's been sitting on that shelf all my life,

297
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:33,108
and I kind of liked that it was there. It was a nice thing, a nice tradition.

298
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:36,773
I had pleasant associations with it, and now I want to break it into a million pieces.

299
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,606
- What inspired her?
- Who knows?

300
00:18:38,674 --> 00:18:42,052
- Have you been sending out a vibe or something?
- A vibe, no. What kind of vibe?

301
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,915
- Like a marriage vibe.
- I don't know what that is. I mean, maybe.

302
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:47,787
I love Dave. If you love a boy, do you automatically send out a marriage vibe?

303
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,215
- I don't think so.
- I feel weird just saying that.

304
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,359
Well, wait, why did you and Dave get into a big fight?

305
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,589
Well, I didn't send him the jug, but I had to give him a heads-up in case he called here innocently

306
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:59,770
and my mom said something to him like, "You rent that tux yet?" So I did,

307
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:02,399
and he was really mean about it. He was very against getting the jug.

308
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:05,758
- You thought he'd be all for it?
- No, but he was way too down on the idea.

309
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:09,147
- Lane, he's eighteen. He just started college.
- I know.

310
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,107
- Jug or no jug, he's not ready to get married.
- I know.

311
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:14,877
- And neither are you.
- I know. Someday maybe.

312
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,200
- Yes, someday, but not now.
- Great. Now we're about to get into a fight?

313
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,929
No, we're not. There have just been enough young people marrying in my life.

314
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,803
- I don't want any more.
- Okay.

315
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,781
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know. She's going to expect a call or note from him,

316
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:29,209
- thanking his soon-to-be mother-in-law or else she'll be offended.
- Probably.

317
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:33,861
- I guess I've got to talk to her about it.
- I don't see any other way.

318
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:36,417
- Whoa.
- What?

319
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,130
- Someone wrote something on our door... "Die Jerk."
- It says "Die Jerk"?

320
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:45,577
- It's not coming off.
- Wow. Cool things like that never happen at adventist school.

321
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,665
- Rory.
- Someone wrote "Die Jerk" on our door.

322
00:19:47,738 --> 00:19:50,563
I know. I thought maybe the person who did it was back to make good on the promise.

323
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:52,633
- Who did this?
- I don't know, but we've got to find out

324
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,876
and strike back hard. Come on, we're assembling inside.

325
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:57,537
Lane, I gotta go. We're assembling. Sorry about the jug.

326
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,867
- It's okay. Keep me posted.
- Yeah, you, too. Bye.

327
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:02,969
What's your business here?

328
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,959
- Fun stuff, huh, guys?
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.

329
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,241
- I may have been here when it happened.
- And you heard nothing?

330
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:10,813
- No.
- Way to have that radar up.

331
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,489
- Let's not make each other feel bad.
- Hey, hug a dolphin another day, all right?

332
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:18,160
We need to rev up the gunships and retaliate before the next strike. We gotta go full-out Sharon.

333
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:21,422
- There's gonna be another strike?
- You wanna wait to find out?

334
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:24,413
Now, first, we should each make a list of the people we've made enemies of,

335
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:27,372
- starting with most recent and working our way back.
- Can't we just let this go?

336
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:30,699
- It may just be a joke.
- I'm not laughing. Anyone here laughing?

337
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:32,804
- I guess it is vandalism.
- It's more than that.

338
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,835
This is an assault that should be met head-on using extreme prejudice.

339
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:39,762
Now let's face it, I'm the most likely target, so I've already made up a list of enemies,

340
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,971
- which I've narrowed down from twenty-six to five.
- Just at Yale?

341
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:44,913
- Just in this building.
- Maybe we should move.

342
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:46,833
Retreat? I think not.

343
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:50,504
There's a girl on my volleyball team who's livid at me. I kissed her boyfriend.

344
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:52,910
- I'm exceedingly dull.
- Keep her close.

345
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:54,666
- What about you?
- Me?

346
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,070
- Made anyone mad lately?
- Oh, please, that would be like Dorothy pissing off the Tin Man. It's impossible.

347
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:01,891
- I'm not leaving my room.
- I'll keep you posted on my person.

348
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:04,231
- And my five are already taken care of.
- They're taken care of?

349
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:07,384
I got my East Side 860 partners on it. Now let's move.

350
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:11,004
- Wanna watch tv?
- Something light.

351
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:12,074
I'm with you.

352
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,640
- Hi, Luke.
- Hi. Take a seat anywhere.

353
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:20,422
- Very hungry.
- Yeah, you're in the right place.

354
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:21,527
- Twice.
- What?

355
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:25,075
- I've come here twice. This is my second trip today.
- Oh, right, yeah. Well, you didn't eat.

356
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:27,389
- Oh, you knew I was here?
- Why didn't you stay?

357
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:28,506
I wasn't that hungry.

358
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:33,016
- So, what's new?
- Got some new coffee pots.

359
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:34,431
- Anything else?
- New filters.

360
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,321
- Anything else?
- No.

361
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,174
- Anything else?
- Other than "no", no.

362
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:40,466
Nicole, Luke. Nicole was here.

363
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:44,993
She's the one who told you that I was here and didn't stay. She's new. Nothing new.

364
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:47,060
Well, you saw her, so it's not new.

365
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:50,307
Oh, it's so new. What's going on there?

366
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:54,869
- We're kind of seeing each other again.
- Thank you, and... boy!

367
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:57,224
- It's not heavy-duty.
- So you're not getting divorced?

368
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,358
- Yeah, we put it on hold.
- Put the divorce on hold?

369
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:02,083
- Can you do that?
- I don't know. It's all new to me.

370
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,863
- So, is she moving in with you?
- No.

371
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:07,760
What, no? You're husband and wife. It's not a crazy question.

372
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:11,477
No, we're man and woman. We're just seeing each other as if we're not husband and wife.

373
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:15,283
Oh, well, the state of Connecticut sees it differently, you know.

374
00:22:15,354 --> 00:22:20,139
To the state, you're sharing a toothbrush holder and deciding together whether there's enough in the dishwasher

375
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:23,924
- to justify running it.
- Hopefully, the state will stay out of my way.

376
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:25,655
- Now, what about taxes?
- What about them?

377
00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:28,025
- Well, you file single, jointly? I mean, what do you do?
- That's not for months.

378
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:31,707
- You can't put it off.
- I'm not doing my taxes right now.

379
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,053
- Capone?
- What?

380
00:22:33,173 --> 00:22:36,361
- They got him for tax evasion.
- I don't plan on evading my taxes.

381
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,957
- Look, why are you pressing this?
- Because it's weird.

382
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:42,439
- You think it's weird?
- Yes. I am a cross section of the community,

383
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,116
and if I think it's weird, then Rory thinks it's weird, and if Rory thinks that, then Miss Patty thinks that,

384
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:49,054
- and so on and so on.
- We're just not dealing with it right now.

385
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:52,760
We're just letting things happen as they happen. We're going with the flow.

386
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,756
- You're going with the flow?
- We're going with the flow.

387
00:22:55,853 --> 00:23:01,026
Oh, that's so strum your sitar, dig the Maharishi, pass the owsley,

388
00:23:01,101 --> 00:23:04,103
- summer of love, flower power, hippie-dippie, I can't stand it.
- You don't have to.

389
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,416
I hope you're not expecting a wedding present, 'cause

390
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:10,656
- I'm just putting it on hold 'til this whole thing clears up.
- Fine.

391
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:13,467
- It's a good present.
- You haven't gotten it yet.

392
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:16,575
- It would have been a good present.
- Look, what is it? You don't like Nicole?

393
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:18,980
I like Nicole. She's very nice.

394
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:24,116
- I don't think she likes me.
- She likes you fine, and, yes, she is very nice,

395
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:30,307
and I missed her and she missed me and so we're dating again, putting off the hassle of getting a stupid divorce.

396
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:35,139
Avoiding that hassle is the nice fringe benefit of getting back together again.

397
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,027
Aha, the hassle. Now we're getting down to it.

398
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,042
If the divorce wasn't a hassle, would you still have gotten back together with her?

399
00:23:42,113 --> 00:23:44,550
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.
- Is that why we're still friends -

400
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,566
because it would be too big a hassle for you to tell me you don't want to be friends anymore?

401
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:49,958
- What do you want to eat?
- Eating's a hassle. I'll just starve.

402
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,678
- Fine.
- And I'll starve right here

403
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,657
- because it would be too big a hassle to get up and leave.
- I'll work around you.

404
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:58,933
And hey, if it's too big a hassle to get rid of my body after I die of starvation,

405
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,231
just leave it here to decompose all nice and quiet - no hassle.

406
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:04,253
- Good.
- See ya.

407
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:07,448
- Wow, she's moving.
- I was kind of kidding about the decomposing here.

408
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:09,660
- But you still haven't eaten.
- I'm not hungry, again.

409
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:10,730
Fine, see ya.

410
00:24:11,212 --> 00:24:14,545
And I liked the old coffee pots. The new ones look stupid.

411
00:24:19,865 --> 00:24:22,363
- Hey, someone was looking for you.
- Oh, who?

412
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,995
It's probably better that they don't find you.

413
00:24:27,873 --> 00:24:29,654
- You are very brave.
- What?

414
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:33,023
If you hear the rustle of tulle coming up behind you, run.

415
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:46,275
- Rory Gilmore?
- Yeah?

416
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:48,342
- Remember me?
- I don't think so.

417
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:49,945
- That's very flattering.
- Can I help you?

418
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:53,612
Let's see if this jogs your memory. I have the grace of a drunken dock worker?

419
00:24:53,832 --> 00:24:56,740
- Remember me now?
- The ballerina from the ballet.

420
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:00,068
- That's right.
- Your outfits are made of tulle, aren't they?

421
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:03,365
- You're a jerk!
- I know. You wrote that on my door.

422
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:05,450
- You're lucky that's all I did!
- Should we go somewhere else?

423
00:25:05,521 --> 00:25:08,322
Your review was mean and petty and despicable!

424
00:25:08,404 --> 00:25:12,828
Look, Sandra - that's your name, right? Sandra? This was all in the line of duty.

425
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:16,289
It was an assignment from my editor, so it was nothing personal, okay?

426
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:19,872
- You called me a hippo!
- No, I compared you to a hippo,

427
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,738
that's not calling you a hippo. And it was a humorous comparison. I was trying to -

428
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,478
- To destroy me and my company!
- No, and think about it...

429
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:30,507
I bet that more than likely, very few people will even read the review,

430
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:33,698
and most people aren't even interested in ballet in the first place.

431
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:37,671
It's unfortunate and awful and I hate it, but what can you do?

432
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:39,892
It's Avril Lavigne's world, and we're just living in it.

433
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:44,752
Plus, most people left before the end, and I stuck it out. That's something.

434
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:47,835
I'm curious. How much ballet experience do you have?

435
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:50,487
You must have a lot since you write about it with such authority.

436
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:55,310
Well, none to speak of. I had a few years of beginners' class and I stunk.

437
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:58,561
- Anybody write about it in the paper?
- No. Good point.

438
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:02,425
I've been dancing three hours a day, seven days a week for fourteen years.

439
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:06,496
I've done two summer sessions with the Miami ballet, and I'm on the waiting list at Juilliard,

440
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:09,072
and now your review is out there for everyone to see!

441
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:12,246
Look, I...
- You're a jerk! I just wanted to come tell you that to your face!

442
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:15,846
You're a jerk, and I hope you die! Bye, jerk. Die, jerk.

443
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:22,988
- The door thing was about you?
- Apparently.

444
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,176
The strike is off. Stand down. I repeat, stand down.

445
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:37,047
- Hi, Mom.
- Come in, come in.

446
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:40,935
You look tenser than usual. What's wrong?

447
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:43,683
Oh, it's your father. I wanted him to go upstairs and clean up,

448
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:47,222
- but I can't pry him away from that partner of his.
- Digger's here?

449
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:49,633
They're in the study doing something computery.

450
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:52,296
When did we suddenly become so dependent on computers?

451
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:55,198
- Finally.
- Now how far can I go, Jason?

452
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:58,081
- As far as you want. It should work anywhere.
- Ah, fantastic.

453
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,416
- Richard, our company's here.
- We have company?

454
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:04,293
- Oh, actually, it's just me.
- Oh, I suppose you're company.

455
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:08,040
- Say, are you and Rory wireless?
- Oh, no, we're pretty wired most of the time.

456
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,451
- Why are you carrying that?
- We're testing it.

457
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:14,896
Jason here has just helped me hook up a wireless network for the house. Wi-Fi, it's called.

458
00:27:14,982 --> 00:27:16,954
- Oh, neat.
- Is that necessary?

459
00:27:17,328 --> 00:27:19,990
- Oh, Lorelai, this is Jason Stiles.
- We've met.

460
00:27:20,082 --> 00:27:23,543
- Really?
- Emily, they knew each other as kids. You knew that.

461
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:25,657
- Oh, that's right.
- Great to see you again.

462
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,603
- Oh, same here.
- Look at this!

463
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:32,088
I'm walking around, and I'm still on the internet. Emily, I'm going to google you.

464
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,526
You are certainly not going to google me!

465
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:37,608
It's a search engine, Emily. He's just gonna find you out in cyberspace.

466
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:41,571
- This sounds absurd.
- Nah, can't use a laptop here, Jason.

467
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:45,016
- The signal doesn't reach.
- When do you plan to use it in the dark corner by the staircase, Richard?

468
00:27:45,093 --> 00:27:48,519
- Well, you never know.
- I don't like the idea of your using it anywhere but your study.

469
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:52,476
- I'm just testing it!
- They're always fighting over toys, these two.

470
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:58,052
- It's crystal clear out here.
- Richard, it's freezing outside!

471
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,770
- I won't be a minute.
- Ridiculous.

472
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:03,474
I have to go check on dinner. Excuse me.

473
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,849
So, how have you been these past twenty-five years?

474
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:11,795
- Good. Hey, moved out of my parents' house.
- Rad.

475
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,266
- Love the freedom.
- Well, you don't have to hide the bong anymore.

476
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:16,028
Hey, did you get any flowers lately?

477
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:19,878
Uh, several times. Apparently, I have a secret admirer.

478
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:23,493
- I signed all the cards "Jason."
- I thought it was Jason Priestley.

479
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,802
- You're disappointed.
- No, I just wish I hadn't slept with Jason Priestley.

480
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:29,146
- How's the new inn?
- Coming along. We're gonna have horses.

481
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:31,210
- Talking horses?
- No, just the regular ones.

482
00:28:31,302 --> 00:28:32,935
- We could get married there.
- Where?

483
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,713
- The inn, on horseback.
- Oh. So, you unwired my father, huh?

484
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:39,294
- Per Richard's request. He wanted it.
- Emily doesn't.

485
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:42,756
- I cannot win with her.
- You're getting the triple freeze from her. It's nice.

486
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:44,398
- Takes the onus off her daughter.
- But the more she hates me,

487
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:48,228
- the more likely it is that you will go out with me.
- That's not necessarily the case.

488
00:28:48,316 --> 00:28:51,439
- Good, because I gotta make some serious progress with her.
- Good luck with that.

489
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:52,919
Maybe I should get her to invite me to dinner.

490
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:58,683
- I'm sorry. As if you control these things.
- Well, I'm not God, but I have influence.

491
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,917
No way is she inviting you to dinner.

492
00:29:01,023 --> 00:29:02,919
Would you have a problem with me staying for dinner?

493
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:06,477
- No. You won't stay because you won't be invited.
- I will.

494
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:07,567
Let's see it.

495
00:29:08,474 --> 00:29:12,221
Hi, hon. Jason, this is my daughter, Rory. Rory, Jason.

496
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,988
- Right, Scooper.
- Digger.

497
00:29:14,116 --> 00:29:15,841
- Sorry. Digger.
- It's nice to meet you.

498
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:18,816
And I don't really go by Digger anymore.

499
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:21,396
- What is it, P. Digger now?
- I'll just call you Jason.

500
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,234
You're a very kind young lady.

501
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:27,535
Jason, I just hit F12, and everything's going to hell.

502
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:28,626
Easily fixed.

503
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:33,362
- Hey. How are things?
- Surreal... on a whole new level of surreal.

504
00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:36,300
- What happened?
- I was harangued by an incensed ballerina.

505
00:29:36,382 --> 00:29:38,836
That is Salvador Dali surreal. What ballerina?

506
00:29:38,922 --> 00:29:41,349
>From the ballet we went to - the one I wrote about.

507
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:47,002
This girl marched up to me in the dining hall and busted me on the bad review I gave her.

508
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:50,227
Wait a second. Are people allowed to do that, yell at the reviewer?

509
00:29:50,315 --> 00:29:53,402
I frown on it. I mean, it's upsetting and ridiculous.

510
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:56,377
- I'll probably laugh at it someday, but not today.
- What did you write?

511
00:29:56,463 --> 00:30:00,134
Well, I brought it for you to read. Tell me what you think because my picky editor loved it.

512
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,151
- I mean, loved it.
- Sure, sure. This is very weird.

513
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:04,574
Very read.

514
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:08,240
- Whoa.
- What?

515
00:30:08,357 --> 00:30:11,644
- Well, you really hated this ballet.
- Well, we both really hated it. Remember?

516
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:12,725
Yeah, I do.

517
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,882
- Jeez.
- Oh, now, come on.

518
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:19,776
- Well, this is just so harsh.
- Again, you were there.

519
00:30:19,863 --> 00:30:22,622
I know, but there's something about seeing it in print.

520
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:26,493
- People don't write as mean as they talk, except you.
- I wrote what I felt.

521
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:31,024
- "The roll around the bra strap"?
- That was your line!

522
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:34,849
- It was? I'm awful.
- And it's not even critical of the ballerina's skills.

523
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:39,456
- It's critical of the costumer's skills.
- I know, but it sounds like she couldn't fit into a standard leotard.

524
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:43,323
She couldn't! But again, the costumer should have put her in a larger leotard.

525
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,692
- Do I see the word "hippo" coming up?
- Give me the paper.

526
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:49,676
- I'm sorry, it's just so specific.
- It's what I saw, so I wrote it.

527
00:30:49,774 --> 00:30:52,395
- That's what the editor told me to do.
- Well, then you did the right thing.

528
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:55,533
- I was too harsh.
- You said yourself, you were supposed to be.

529
00:30:55,622 --> 00:30:58,069
- Rory, you're here. Good.
- Hi, Grandma.

530
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,970
Don't tell me Richard's still traipsing around with that thing.

531
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,150
- Richard, please come inside and close the door.
- Coming, coming.

532
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,980
- Oh, Jason, you're still here.
- Oh, I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye to you, Emily.

533
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:14,088
- Whatcha got there, Grandpa?
- A laptop.

534
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:16,485
- The Gilmore house is now wireless.
- Cool.

535
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:19,782
And the laptop is now going back in its case because dinner is ready.

536
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:22,773
I'll be taking off everybody. I've got a cheeseburger waiting for me.

537
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:26,142
- Goodbye, Jason.
- A cheeseburger? That's not a proper meal.

538
00:31:26,228 --> 00:31:29,684
Oh, please, Richard, it's my favorite meal. I've had one for dinner three times this week.

539
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:33,581
- Oh, you're joking.
- With the right bread and meat, a cheeseburger can make a fine meal.

540
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:36,176
- Thank you, Emily.
- You're defending cheeseburgers, Emily?

541
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,269
- When was the last time you had one?
- This isn't just any cheeseburger, Richard.

542
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:43,191
- There's this stand that makes them special for me.
- A stand?

543
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:47,635
- I hear those can be very good.
- Emily, are we going to send this young bachelor out for fast food?

544
00:31:47,727 --> 00:31:51,347
- Oh, no, no, I couldn't stay. I'd be putting you out.
- Nonsense.

545
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:54,214
- I'm not sure we have enough.
- We always have enough.

546
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:56,244
Oh, no, no, I wouldn't hear of it.

547
00:31:56,478 --> 00:32:02,729
Emily, my business partner is going to be standing outside eating a cheeseburger.

548
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,766
Jason, would you like to join us for dinner?

549
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:11,100
The cheeseburger will just have to wait.

550
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:13,434
I'll tell the cook.

551
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:15,007
Cheeseburger.

552
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:28,273
- This food is incredible.
- Yeah. It's my first lobster thermidor.

553
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,917
- Your recipe?
- No.

554
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:35,488
Hey, can you thermidor other foods? You know, fish thermidor, Spam thermidor, enchiladas thermidor?

555
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:41,109
I don't think so. Cora, since we're five instead of four, Richard and I will ration if we have to.

556
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:43,387
Oh, I don't think rationing will be necessary, Emily.

557
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,254
- Yeah, Mom, you can just pick off my plate.
- You've forgotten all about that burger, I hope.

558
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:48,819
- After the first mouthful.
- Good.

559
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:52,316
You know, Richard, having a computer at home with a high-speed internet access is gonna free up your time enormously.

560
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:54,636
- Oh, I should say so.
- How?

561
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:56,884
- How is it gonna free up his time?
- Yes.

562
00:32:57,161 --> 00:33:01,671
Well, he'll be using email more, which means fewer phone calls with chitchat that you have to get through

563
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,247
before you get down to business. That's what eats up most of the time.

564
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:05,961
- Email seems very cold to me.
- But fast.

565
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:09,536
- Fast isn't always better.
- A good point and very true.

566
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:12,726
Oh, Jason was saying that you'll get use out of this system, too, Emily.

567
00:33:12,828 --> 00:33:15,118
- Me? How?
- The internet. Have you checked it out?

568
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:17,805
- I'd have no use for it.
- I wouldn't dismiss it so fast, Mom.

569
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:21,562
- The internet is more than just good porn now.
- Yeah, I'm on it constantly.

570
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,558
- What do you use it for?
- Research like for when I can't get to the library.

571
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,349
- And for shopping.
- Yeah, shopping.

572
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:27,958
- A lot of shopping.
- Shopping?

573
00:33:28,044 --> 00:33:30,773
Yeah, the stores you normally have to go to, they're on the internet now.

574
00:33:30,871 --> 00:33:35,464
But going to a nice store is half the fun of shopping. I like being greeted at the door

575
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:39,683
and the bustle of people and the shoes and clothes all lined up nice and pretty.

576
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,875
- That's true.
- Yeah, we like that, too.

577
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:46,636
Having someone help you pick out the right thing or help you exchange it if it's not right.

578
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:50,184
- With the internet, what do you do? Mail it back?
- We usually just forget.

579
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:52,109
- Yeah.
- So you're just out the money?

580
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:54,710
- Pretty much.
- I don't get it.

581
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:58,130
- I don't get it anymore either.
- We should go to real stores more often.

582
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,475
But the internet is really good.

583
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:06,226
So, which camp was it where you two met?

584
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:10,368
- It had a funny name and canoes.
- They all have funny names and canoes.

585
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,974
- Was it Camp Waziata?
- Doesn't sound familiar.

586
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:15,297
- Which one asked me to leave?
- You got kicked out of camp?

587
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:18,104
- I tried to liberate the horses.
- Camp Chataguay. That's where we met.

588
00:34:18,212 --> 00:34:20,398
- That's the one.
- I enjoyed camp. I made some good friends.

589
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,917
- I met your father at that camp.
- Dad, really?

590
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:26,161
We bunked together for a summer. Incredible athlete and a good guy - a really good guy.

591
00:34:26,254 --> 00:34:27,709
- He hated you.
- What?

592
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:29,348
- With a passion.
- No, I don't remember that.

593
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:32,338
I'm pretty sure. Didn't he try to dunk your head in a toilet bowl

594
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,825
- after you heckled him during some campfire talent show?
- No, I don't...

595
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:39,491
- oh, my God, I've been repressing that!
- Oh, that doesn't sound like Christopher.

596
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,439
No, it's okay, Richard. I'm positive I deserved it.

597
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,239
Rory, I've been meaning to mention to you, we read that wonderful review

598
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:50,985
- you wrote on the ballet. It was excellent.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho, you eviscerated that girl.

599
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:54,062
I actually didn't mean to eviscerate her. I was just trying to be honest.

600
00:34:54,124 --> 00:34:57,739
Well, you honestly sliced her open and ripped out her guts.

601
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:00,043
- Your pen was your knife.
- Right.

602
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:04,728
- I especially liked the reference to the hippo.
- That seems to be the most memorable for people.

603
00:35:04,793 --> 00:35:08,149
- And the bra strap.
- I should give you a copy of it to read, Jason. It's terrific.

604
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:10,607
- It sounds interesting.
- I just wrote what I thought.

605
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:15,767
And the line about regretting how evolution had led man to stand on two feet because it led to this night.

606
00:35:17,512 --> 00:35:20,646
- Sorry. I hadn't read that far.
- Why are you apologizing? It is funny.

607
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:23,826
Well, the ballerina in question had kind of a negative reaction to the whole thing.

608
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,612
- So what?
- Well, yes, don't feel badly about this, Rory.

609
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:30,509
Sometimes people don't know at a young age that they're not good at doing something.

610
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:33,963
- Now that poor girl can go to business school.
- She's actually not as bad as she sounds.

611
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:37,450
- It's rare to read a truthful review.
- I was going to go see that ballet,

612
00:35:37,532 --> 00:35:40,543
- and now I don't have to. Thank you.
- You're welcome, I guess.

613
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,589
- We were just burned by a dishonest review in the Courant.
- That French restaurant.

614
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:46,630
They must have had the reviewer in their pocket.

615
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:51,009
- The man raved about this place, and it was abominable.
- The food was inedible.

616
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:54,280
And the service... I had to snap my fingers to get our waiter's attention.

617
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:58,438
You know, Emily, as a woman of taste, I could use your recommendation of restaurants in the area.

618
00:35:58,494 --> 00:36:02,057
I've been away so long, I'm just woefully out of touch.

619
00:36:02,134 --> 00:36:04,915
- Oh, I'm no more an expert than the next person.
- You're being humble.

620
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:08,391
- Yeah, Mom, cough it up. You've been everywhere.
- Multiple times.

621
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:12,866
Well, I guess if you're looking for a place for a business lunch, you can't do better than Portofino's.

622
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:16,829
They give you attentive service without rushing you, and it's wonderful Italian food.

623
00:36:16,901 --> 00:36:20,531
Well, you can't beat Italian. I mean, is there anyone here who doesn't love Italian?

624
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:21,898
- Not me.
- Or me.

625
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:24,601
- Good to know. Anything else, Emily?
- You need more?

626
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:27,882
- Please. I'm a desperate man.
- Well, don't be shy, Emily.

627
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,159
- You're a walking Zagat guide.
- Well, there's always Lil's for steak.

628
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:34,323
- Steak's always good. I'm good with that any time.
- I love steak.

629
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:40,289
Really? So steak is good. How about ethnic food? Indian? Thai?

630
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:44,063
- I personally detest Thai food.
- Me, too. Chinese is good.

631
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:47,546
- As long as it's authentic.
- So cross Thai off the list.

632
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,009
- I would.
- Same here.

633
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,753
How about something with a more romantic atmosphere?

634
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:54,856
Why would you need a romantic atmosphere for business?

635
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:57,339
- Yeah, why?
- I'd like to know myself.

636
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:03,083
A client might want a recommendation for him and his wife, and I would like to be prepared.

637
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,569
My partner.

638
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:08,183
- That would be Mill on the River.
- Oh, yes.

639
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,972
- Very dark, very atmospheric.
- Sounds nice.

640
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:17,190
- Very.
- Good, we've made progress here, but I'm monopolizing the conversation.

641
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:20,214
- Oh, that's okay.
- Can I call you later to continue this?

642
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:23,758
- Absolutely. Call me sometime next week.
- I'll be sure to do that.

643
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:28,704
- You want to re-review the ballet?
- Yes, I do, Doyle,

644
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:31,868
because I have a brand-new perspective on it and on dance.

645
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:34,290
I was ignorant before, so this would be a whole new piece.

646
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:37,556
- We don't re-review things.
- Well, there's a first time for everything,

647
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:41,689
- and I could even buy my own ticket if that's a problem.
- But it closed early because of your review.

648
00:37:41,888 --> 00:37:44,786
I did not know that. But it's not a problem.

649
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,839
I'll just redo the one I already did. That ballet is seared in there, so I could just replay it in my head.

650
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:53,076
But your review was great. People are still talking about it. That's pretty rare.

651
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:57,371
Okay, okay. Well, what about just a general-interest article on the lead ballerina?

652
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,080
- Is she the hippo?
- No. No.

653
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:03,924
She is an accomplished dancer and her life is quite fascinating.

654
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:08,743
Did you know that she studied dance for fourteen years and has performed in Miami?

655
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:12,281
- Miami... that's pretty big. Miami.
- It's boring.

656
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,880
- Well, she almost got into Juilliard.
- That's not interesting either.

657
00:38:15,971 --> 00:38:20,944
Well, no, but these are simply background facts of a fascinating personal journey.

658
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:26,020
A personal journey of an artist struggling against the indifference of an indifferent society,

659
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:30,329
just dancing as fast as she can. Well, it's "8 Mile" meets "Fame."

660
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:32,372
- I know what's going on here.
- What?

661
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:35,761
You're feeling bad about the effect your article had on the people in the ballet.

662
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:38,941
- No, that's not it.
- We heard about the dining-hall confrontation.

663
00:38:39,043 --> 00:38:41,665
That was not really a confrontation. We were just chatting.

664
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:46,677
It goes with the territory. When I was your age, I reviewed a clog-dancing team that was really bad.

665
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:50,221
I mean, even compared to other clog dancers. I was merciless.

666
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:56,196
But... if I can't re-review it, then can I just print the things that I meant to put in and didn't have time to?

667
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:59,682
- Hurting people's feelings is what we do.
- But when I become a real journalist,

668
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:03,757
- the people in my reviews aren't gonna live in my building.
- Doesn't matter.

669
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:07,465
- When you write for the Yale Daily News, you are a real journalist.
- I didn't mean...

670
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:11,106
- And if you can't handle it, you should leave the paper.
- I don't want to leave the paper.

671
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:15,110
Good. Here. Your next assignment.

672
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:17,761
- Thanks.
- Knock 'em dead.

673
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:25,364
Dinner is going to be a little late tonight. My gluten patties caught fire,

674
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:27,596
so we're switching to spaghetti and wheat balls.

675
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:30,905
- Mama, can we talk about something?
- What's that?

676
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:34,811
- It's the jug for Dave.
- I gave that to you days ago. Why haven't you sent it?

677
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:37,566
- I can't send it, Mama.
- What do you mean you can't?

678
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:41,108
- Of course you can. I showed you how to tape the bubble wrap.
- No, I mean, I can't!

679
00:39:41,174 --> 00:39:43,291
- What is wrong with you?
- Mama, please listen.

680
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:46,418
- All right.
- This is important, and I want to be clear,

681
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:49,240
- and I want to say it right, but it's hard.
- I'm listening.

682
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:54,687
Dave is my first boyfriend, and he's important to me - very important.

683
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:58,267
- I know that.
- And his being in California like this, it's been hard,

684
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:02,910
and it's even caused some problems. But in other ways, I think it's brought us closer.

685
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:06,760
- Yes?
- But I'm still in school and he's still in school,

686
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:14,370
and while I respect you and I respect the jug and all that the jug represents... all the bright hopes and all the tradition...

687
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:22,463
I cannot give Dave the jug. Not now. Maybe one day, but not now.

688
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,679
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

689
00:40:25,766 --> 00:40:28,223
- What do you mean?
- You're putting it with all the clearance items?

690
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:30,481
- So?
- You're selling my marriage jug?

691
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:31,935
- Your what?
- My marriage jug.

692
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:34,496
- What's that?
- The jug you kept to give to the boy I'm going to marry.

693
00:40:34,573 --> 00:40:37,025
- What are you talking about?
- You told me when I was like six

694
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:41,697
that this was my special marriage jug that you were gonna keep on a special high shelf for the boy I'm going to marry.

695
00:40:41,796 --> 00:40:43,527
- This thing?
- Yes.

696
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,427
- It's just a jug.
- What?

697
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,747
I probably told you that to make you stop crying. You always cried when you were little.

698
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,890
- Gave me a headache.
- It's just a jug?

699
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:53,527
- I've got tons of them. They're hard to move.
- But...

700
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,626
- We could make it a marriage jug, whatever that is.
- No, no, never mind. It doesn't matter.

701
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:01,938
- I'll send something else to Dave.
- Good.

702
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,515
Oh! My wheat balls!

703
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,838
So, why can't you show your face at Luke's?

704
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:15,898
It's just for a while. Hey, where are you?

705
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:19,168
The theater. That's why I'm talking softly. I'm reviewing some music thing.

706
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:24,200
- So, now, why can't you go to Luke's?
- I got into an argument with Luke about Nicole.

707
00:41:24,323 --> 00:41:26,188
- Nicole?
- They're back together.

708
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,477
- I didn't know that. I walk into Luke's and there she is.
- And he hadn't told you?

709
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:36,126
No, and I was the very picture of awkwardness, and basically, I just fled.

710
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:41,210
And when I saw Luke later, we got into a fight about it, and I told him his coffee pots were stupid.

711
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:46,304
- So it was very sophisticated.
- He is so guarded, so uncooperative.

712
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:49,320
You know, you should probably get over your problem with Luke being uncooperative.

713
00:41:49,408 --> 00:41:53,652
Well, I don't want there to be weirdness between me and Nicole if she's back in our lives.

714
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:58,187
I mean, Luke has gotta get it through his thick skull that whoever is in his life is in my life, too.

715
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,570
- Really?
- Yes.

716
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:01,628
- That's not a little stalkery?
- No.

717
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:06,794
- We are a small, close-knit community.
- So, you're gonna tell Luke about Jason?

718
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:09,273
- What about him?
- Well, there's something happening there.

719
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,753
- Not really.
- There was a palpable vibe.

720
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:16,686
- Palpable to everyone?
- Just me. Grandma and Grandpa were oblivious.

721
00:42:16,794 --> 00:42:19,599
- Hey, would that be crazy?
- What?

722
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:22,210
- For us to go out together?
- All three of us?

723
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:24,499
- Jason and I.
- A little.

724
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:28,252
- Well, yeah, I haven't decided.
- Well, I'm happy to report

725
00:42:28,351 --> 00:42:31,239
- that there have been no more run-ins with the ballerina.
- Good.

726
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:35,267
We're not destined to be buddies anytime soon, but sometimes you have to make an enemy.

727
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,704
- When you have a job to do...
- Then you have a job to do.

728
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,805
- It's starting, I gotta go.
- Okay.

729
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:42,255
- Have fun.
- I will.
