1
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,496
- Mail! 
- Mail!

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,781
Hurry up! Where are your shoes?

3
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,144
- I’ll get ‘em later. 
- No, get ‘em now.

4
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:20,056
- Why? 
- Why?

5
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:22,360
Because if your Harvard acceptance letter is in that batch of mail

6
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:25,206
and you do not have shoes on, we can’t run off immediately and celebrate.

7
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:28,059
All of our happiness will be on hold until you come back inside

8
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,410
and put on your shoes.

9
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:30,957
Is that what you want to put a hold on happiness?

10
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:32,824
What’s the difference if we wait then or we wait now?

11
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:33,896
Because we are not happy now.

12
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:35,069
Right, okay.

13
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:37,035
No laces, just get ‘em on your feet.

14
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:40,034
Let’s go!

15
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:45,606
- Kirk! 
- Kirk!

16
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,127
Good morning, ladies.

17
00:00:47,244 --> 00:00:48,079
Is there an envelope in there?

18
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:49,406
A big envelope, not a little envelope.

19
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:50,594
Yeah, a big envelope means she’s in,

20
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,981
a little envelope means she needs to marry rich.

21
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,691
Just one second, please.

22
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:56,072
Aren’t you supposed to go through the mail before you get here?

23
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:57,352
Some work that way.

24
00:00:57,445 --> 00:00:59,487
Personally, I think it takes the spontaneity out of the job.

25
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:00,225
Need some help?

26
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,699
Sorry, federal law prohibits it.

27
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:03,025
Any chance you could go faster?

28
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,164
Yeah, you got a girl’s future in that sack of yours, Santa.

29
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:07,832
- Thank you for adding the Santa. 
- Any time.

30
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:08,842
You know what I’ve noticed?

31
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,447
It wouldn’t be any mail in there with our names on it, would it?

32
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:13,327
I’ve noticed people don’t slow down anymore.

33
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,175
Guess I’ve got time to tie my shoes.

34
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,489
Yes, cobble yourself a new pair Daniel Day Lewis.

35
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:20,449
No one stops to smell a nice flower or look at a puppy.

36
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,812
You’re absolutely right.

37
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,963
No one stops to ask how you’re doing...

38
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:26,508
is your family well, did you see that game last night?

39
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:27,741
Yeah, people suck. Is that ours?

40
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:30,578
What? Oh. Mrs. Rita Flora. Nope.

41
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,017
- Rats. 
- It could still be in there.

42
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,471
Rita Flora – didn’t she die?

43
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,028
While you were delivering her mail?

44
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,513
She did die. She died last week.

45
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:37,101
Kirk.

46
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:39,037
They’re supposed to put your mail on hold when you die.

47
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:40,082
Okay, let’s go back inside.

48
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,080
What about the envelope?

49
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:43,057
We’ll check back on our way to Luke’s... for dinner.

50
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,669
Hey, one for Kirk.

51
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:43,665
It’s getting frustrating.

52
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:46,158
I mean, there’s so many great songs that have been written post-Cobain,

53
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:47,617
but try and convince Zach of that.

54
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:50,270
I mean, he’s impossible, stubborn, and just a tad intellectually challenged,

55
00:02:50,362 --> 00:02:51,248
in case you haven’t noticed.

56
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,339
- Lane, honey? 
- Yeah?

57
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:53,634
Just, could you, with the sticks there, I can’t...

58
00:02:53,737 --> 00:02:54,741
Oh, sorry. Nervous habit.

59
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,537
Mom’s a little crabby this morning.

60
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,837
I’m not crabby, I’m very, very ill.

61
00:02:58,018 --> 00:02:59,973
- With allergies. 
- Deadly allergies.

62
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:01,566
Sorry, didn’t mean to minimize your condition.

63
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:03,040
Should we make funeral arrangements now?

64
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:05,784
Yes. But make sure you can get your money back in case this stuff works.

65
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:06,892
Where did you get those?

66
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:07,782
Found ‘em in your room.

67
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,134
These expired in ‘98.

68
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:10,348
So, what, I should take four?

69
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:11,586
Yes, that’s exactly my point.

70
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:12,298
Here.

71
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:14,239
- New menus. 
- Very fancy.

72
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:16,236
- Why’d you get new menus? 
- It was time.

73
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:18,371
But I had made little doodles with my name

74
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,542
hidden in them on each one of the old ones just like Hirschfeld.

75
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:21,330
Sorry.

76
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,149
It took me years to hit every menu.

77
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,775
And these have super heavy plastic over them. How am I gonna doodle?

78
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:28,197
Has it ever occurred to you that the super heavy plastic is there

79
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:29,861
to discourage the doodling?

80
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,596
- Hey, this looks different. 
- It’s not different.

81
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:33,261
- It’s totally different. 
- It’s not that different.

82
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,592
There are more salads.

83
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,554
Three more salads.

84
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,039
Three more salads – who needs three more salads?

85
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:37,874
One was enough.

86
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:39,523
- Well, Nicole said... 
- Nicole said.

87
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,293
There wasn’t really that much for her to eat on the menu, so I just...

88
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:44,382
Oh, you added three more salads just for Nicole.

89
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:47,327
When I asked you to add chili-topped Pringles, you said no.

90
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:48,679
And I stand by that.

91
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,777
How come Nicole gets three salads and I still get a no?

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,078
Because Nicole is his girlfriend.

93
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:53,400
Nicole is not my girlfriend,

94
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,882
Nicole is the woman that I am dating, that’s it.

95
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:57,367
So what happens when you guys get serious,

96
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,566
the whole place goes soy?

97
00:03:58,678 --> 00:03:59,538
Just order, please.

98
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:01,083
Did you take off the Monte Cristo sandwich?

99
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:02,452
- Well, I... 
- No!

100
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:04,894
You did, you took off the Monte Cristo sandwich.

101
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,583
I omitted a few obsolete dishes.

102
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,215
I can’t believe Nicole made you take off the Monte Cristo.

103
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,808
She’s got you menu-whipped.

104
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:12,543
She does not have me menu-whipped.

105
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:14,965
I took off a disgusting ridiculous sandwich

106
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:17,146
that no one has ever ordered, including the three of you.

107
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:19,692
But just having it there made us feel like we always could.

108
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,279
- It was comforting. 
- Like soup.

109
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:22,324
Exactly.

110
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,627
It was comforting like deep-fried ham and cheese soup.

111
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:26,543
And even though I never ordered it,

112
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,053
I talked about ordering it, haven’t I?

113
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:29,286
On several occasions.

114
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,961
So you’ve not only eliminated a sandwich,

115
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:33,045
you’ve eliminated a conversation piece.

116
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:34,305
Now what will we talk about?

117
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:35,130
Fine.

118
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:42,293
Here. Old menus, everything’s there. Knock yourselves out.

119
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,344
How come everybody else gets a new menu?

120
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:51,830
I feel much better now.

121
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:56,865
Well, I must say I’m glad to see that simply because the SATs are over,

122
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:59,646
most of you are still taking your classwork seriously.

123
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:00,797
Most of you.

124
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:02,998
Michael Mason.

125
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,160
Worth every wrong answer.

126
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:07,166
All right, before we continue,

127
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:10,557
I would like to remind you that the Chilton Bicentennial celebration

128
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,031
takes place next week.

129
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,404
Number four.

130
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,439
- Well done.
- The official sign up sheet 

131
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,254
for the speech contest has gone up in the back of the room.

132
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,907
The contest will be held on Friday, and the winner

133
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:22,215
will present their speech at the ceremony next week.

134
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:24,556
Now, some of you may be saying to yourself,

135
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:26,656
‘Hey, I already turned in my college application.

136
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,569
Why should I spend all this time entering a speech competition,

137
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:32,041
which if I win means I have to give up a Friday night,

138
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,885
when I can’t even use it for my resume?

139
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:35,087
What’s in it for me?’

140
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:36,594
Wow, that was spooky.

141
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:38,304
Yes, the speech will not go on your record.

142
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,755
However, the bicentennial is going to be quite a prestigious affair.

143
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:44,193
Past alumni and faculty will be there,

144
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:46,578
some of these people are now professors at the same schools

145
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,808
you’re planning an attending.

146
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:50,593
Plus, C-SPAN will be broadcasting the event live.

147
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:53,424
All in all, it’s shaping up to be a very exciting event.

148
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:54,402
Think about it.

149
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:57,136
Oh, I almost forgot to welcome back Brad Langford.

150
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,184
He returns to us fresh from Broadway

151
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,232
where he’s just completed a successful run of Into the Woods.

152
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:03,224
Welcome back, Brad.

153
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:05,437
Thank you. It’s good to be back.

154
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,137
Sit down, Mary Martin.

155
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,093
All right everyone, have a lovely rest of the day.

156
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:10,203
I will see you tomorrow.

157
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,254
Rory, hi.

158
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:16,465
Hey Brad, good to have you back. How was Broadway?

159
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:18,750
It was great, but Nathan Lane is a very bitter man.

160
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:19,620
I’ve heard that.

161
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:22,360
You know, I tell you, even more than the actual experience of performing live,

162
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,945
the confidence it gives you in every aspect of your life,

163
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:26,538
that’s the most amazing thing.

164
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:28,283
Well, you do look rather confident.

165
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:29,497
Hey, it’s the new me.

166
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:32,043
So, Brad... Broadway, I must know.

167
00:06:32,318 --> 00:06:32,913
Yes?

168
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:34,065
Did you get to keep your makeup?

169
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:35,867
What about your costumes, ‘cause that seems great.

170
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:36,983
Ooh, unless you’re doing Les Mis.

171
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:37,679
Or Cats.

172
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:39,502
Furry spandex with a tail and jazz shoes?

173
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,961
Hurrah. So, do you?

174
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,477
- Do I? 
- Get to keep the makeup?

175
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,249
- I didn’t ask. 
- You didn’t ask?

176
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:45,949
How do you leave the house every morning

177
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,613
and not have a piano fall on your head?

178
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,117
Well, I make a left on Federal and then...

179
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,874
Brad, that really didn’t require an answer.

180
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:53,690
You’re blocking the list.

181
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,714
What’s that?

182
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:57,069
Will we please move so you may sign up for the speech contest?

183
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:58,734
Why, yes, Paris, we’d be happy to.

184
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:01,059
How kind of you to phrase it in that very respectful manner.

185
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,001
Are you going to move,

186
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,926
or do you need a five, six, seven, eight?

187
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:07,059
Paris, this time on stage has been a very growing experience for me.

188
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,262
I’m no longer intimidated by you or people like you.

189
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:10,884
I’m thrilled to hear it, Chita Rivera.

190
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,822
Move.

191
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,212
Well, Gilmore, I certainly hope you’re signing up, too.

192
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,557
It’ll be my last chance to trounce you with anything at this school.

193
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:19,886
My decision to do this will in no way depend on you, Paris.

194
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:22,370
I’m only saying it won’t be a totally satisfying victory

195
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,884
just beating Jerome Robbins and the rest of the losers here.

196
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,890
I’d really like to take you down also.

197
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,491
Boy, she is really up on her theater references.

198
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,672
This is outrageous.

199
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:34,070
I am beyond offended.

200
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,622
Did you tell them I’m beyond offended?

201
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,229
Sending my food back?

202
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,998
That’s it, get their names, they’re never eating here again.

203
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:42,103
Wait, what wine was he drinking?

204
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:43,977
1952 Chateau Petrus Bordeaux.

205
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:45,908
Okay, never mind.

206
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,479
Hey, is everything okay?

207
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:51,344
No, we have got to have a better screening system for customers here.

208
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:54,782
Yes, we do, since we currently have no screening system for customers here.

209
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:56,256
They sent it back. My food.

210
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:58,642
My four star, ‘you haven’t lived ‘til you’ve eaten there,

211
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:00,183
says Ruth Reichl,’ food.

212
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:01,350
What did they say was wrong?

213
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:04,305
You name it. Too salty, too hot, too sewer-y.

214
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:06,563
Honey, calm down. Some people are just stupid.

215
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:08,237
Yes, they are stupid,

216
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,408
and stupid people have stupid friends,

217
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,045
and they all have to come here and be stupid together.

218
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,507
Okay, now, don’t be mad at me, but I have to ask this –

219
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,962
are you sure there’s nothing wrong with the food?

220
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:18,457
Of course there’s nothing wrong with the food.

221
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,279
You don’t think that I would know if something was wrong with my food?

222
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:24,878
You don’t think that I tasted every last dish that was sent back.

223
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:26,916
I tasted it, Manuel tasted it,

224
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:29,287
Rico tasted it, Louella tasted it.

225
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,996
We all tasted it and it tastes fine.

226
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:33,798
Okay. Do you mind?

227
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:35,099
You don’t believe me?

228
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:36,557
I believe you completely,

229
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:39,813
but it’s easier for me to take on those who doubt you

230
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:42,267
- if I actually tasted it myself. 
- Fine, go ahead.

231
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,172
Okay, now I get the sewer-y reference.

232
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:48,299
What are you talking about?

233
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,394
Come here.

234
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,341
Just send them out some free desserts.

235
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,936
Free desserts? You’re giving the stupid people free desserts.

236
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:55,540
Sookie, I love you.

237
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:56,521
I love you, too.

238
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,473
Okay, and I love your food, you know that.

239
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:02,082
But I have to tell you that that bite I just had over there

240
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:03,608
is one of the worst things I’ve ever tasted,

241
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:05,084
and I’ve tasted some very bad things.

242
00:09:05,231 --> 00:09:05,821
What?

243
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:06,978
Are you sure you didn’t just accidentally

244
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:08,636
drop something in the food tonight,

245
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:10,793
like, I don’t know, strychnine or manure?

246
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:13,378
No, I tested each dish every step of the way.

247
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,199
I mean, the base, the stock, the sauce, the seasonings.

248
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:18,119
Are you sick? ‘Cause sometimes the flu or a cold

249
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,105
or even allergies can throw your tastebuds off.

250
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:21,324
No, I’m not sick.

251
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:23,705
I mean, I had a little bug last week, but nothing today.

252
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,476
Well, I think you should think about getting a checkup.

253
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,403
Maybe it was more than a little bug.

254
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:28,723
The food was really bad?

255
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:29,994
Oh, honey, it was just...

256
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,645
well, yeah, it was really that bad.

257
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:33,900
I don’t understand it.

258
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,083
Ah, I’m sure it was nothing.

259
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:38,098
Just have Manuel help you with the tasting for the rest of the night, okay?

260
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:40,674
Paris is going to drive me completely insane.

261
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:42,399
- Ooh, that looks good. 
- No!

262
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:43,608
Geez.

263
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,860
Be happy you’re loved, hon. I got a Kit Kat in my purse.

264
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:48,513
What’s up?

265
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:50,960
I don’t know. It’s weird, Sookie must be sick or something.

266
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:51,980
Sookie never gets sick.

267
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:53,060
She’ll be fine.

268
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:54,489
So, tell me, what did Paris do now?

269
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:56,046
It’s nothing, it’s just Paris.

270
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:58,585
There’s this speech contest for the bicentennial,

271
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,418
and I wasn’t even going to enter it,

272
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,759
but I don’t know – with the whole ‘it’s my last chance

273
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:05,098
to crush you before graduation’ comment,

274
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:06,716
I want to enter, I want to win,

275
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,046
and I wanna dance around her saying ‘I win, I win, I win!’

276
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,038
Wow, you’re getting more and more like me everyday.

277
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,399
But I know, it was petty and stupid

278
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:13,536
and I should probably just ignore her.

279
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,103
Yes, that is what you should do.

280
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:16,281
Okay, that is what I will do.

281
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,658
How come you weren’t gonna enter the contest?

282
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:18,554
I don’t know.

283
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:19,726
You love doing school things.

284
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,131
I don’t love doing school things

285
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,784
when it involves the entire school staring at me while I’m doing ‘em.

286
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:25,978
You had to give your vice presidential acceptance speech

287
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:27,197
in front of the entire school.

288
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:28,359
Yeah, but I had to do that.

289
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:31,262
Oh, so you’re just gonna go through life

290
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,010
only doing what you have to do.

291
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,698
Well, no.

292
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:38,345
Because a person who wants to be a foreign correspondent for a living

293
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,757
should probably embrace the opportunity

294
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,055
to practice her speechin’ skills in front of a crowd.

295
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,622
You had the motherly edge going there

296
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,496
until you threw in the speechin’ skills comment.

297
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:47,711
Yeah, you know what I mean.

298
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:48,693
I know what you mean.

299
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,227
- Okay, I’ll go out for the speech. 
- Good.

300
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,018
And if I get to do the ‘I win, I win, I win’ dance,

301
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:56,281
- then so much the better. 
- For everyone involved.

302
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,082
Oh my God. Oh my God.

303
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:05,528
- You’re pregnant! 
- I’m pregnant!

304
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:09,041
- Oh my God, I’m pregnant! 
- You’re pregnant?

305
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,356
- I’m pregnant! 
- That’s why!

306
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,112
What?

307
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:25,094
That just looks like more than four thousand words,

308
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,265
but I’m sure you counted them.

309
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:27,648
- I did. 
- Good.

310
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,398
Hey Shelly, good luck.

311
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,975
Although I’m sure you’re going to be great.

312
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:35,508
After all, there’s hardly anything on stage for you to trip over this time, right?

313
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,285
I’ve got my beans at Grandma’s house, my magic beans at Grandma’s house.

314
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:44,064
Stop it.

315
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:45,616
I’ll take my beans, my magic beans,

316
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:48,166
who’s got the beans, we need some beans, I love the beans.

317
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:49,190
You can’t rattle me.

318
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,890
Into the woods at Grandma’s house.

319
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:52,657
Look, I’m proud of my part, okay?

320
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:54,986
The New York Times called me winningly naïve.

321
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:57,562
Into the woods, into the woods, into the woods.

322
00:11:57,674 --> 00:11:58,586
Stop it right now.

323
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:00,491
I know, that is one annoying song.

324
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,969
Leave Brad alone, and stop terrorizing everyone in this hallway.

325
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:03,853
Terrorizing?

326
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:05,166
What are you talking about, terrorizing?

327
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,019
I’m simply talking to my fellow classmates.

328
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:09,282
You’re trying to scare them into doing badly so you’ll win easier.

329
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:10,803
- I am not. 
- Oh really?

330
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:12,702
And that magical bean recital back there?

331
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:15,084
Hey, I was trying to give the kid some human contact.

332
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:17,608
He’s been talking to nothing but a cow for a year and a half.

333
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,656
There was a person inside that cow, I’ve told you that!

334
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,000
- Brad Langford. 
- I’m winningly naïve.

335
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:23,040
Okay.

336
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:26,957
Brad, you got your beans?

337
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:29,308
Stop. Go Brad, you’ll do great.

338
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,053
It’s amazing how you manage to hide those bolts on the side of your neck.

339
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,635
What is that, just really good cover up?

340
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:38,324
Rory, lower your voice.

341
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,645
People are trying to concentrate.

342
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,723
Wow what?

343
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:44,055
Your speech must really suck.

344
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:45,001
Excuse me?

345
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:47,511
I mean, if you’re going to all this trouble to psych out everyone else,

346
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:49,686
then you must know you have a loser there.

347
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:51,289
Mind games.

348
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,855
Not your forte, cupcake.

349
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,662
Stick to talking to losers off the train tracks, will you?

350
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,245
- You’re horrible. 
- And I’m going to win.

351
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:00,219
Cherry, hi.

352
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:02,897
Man those braces are shiny.

353
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:11,647
Hello

354
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:12,416
It’s me.

355
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:15,907
Every detail, leave nothing out.

356
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:17,546
Well, I told him.

357
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,789
Did he flip? Did he cry? Did he scream?

358
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:21,068
- No. 
- No?

359
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:23,435
- Did he hear you? 
- Yeah, he heard me.

360
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,740
I don’t understand, what happened?

361
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,517
I came home and I got some flowers

362
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:28,883
and I chilled some glasses and I put some music on

363
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,530
and I opened a bottle of champagne,

364
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:33,424
and the cork broke the window so I had to clean up the glass,

365
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,066
and then I taped some cardboard over the hole,

366
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,854
and then I knocked over the bottle of champagne,

367
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:38,984
so I had to get out the mop.

368
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:40,689
My finger’s hitting the fast forward button, hon.

369
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:42,939
So, he came home and I handed him a beer,

370
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,664
and I smiled and I kissed him

371
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:46,572
and I told him he was gonna be a daddy.

372
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:47,623
And then he did what?

373
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,348
- Then he got out the calculator. 
- What?

374
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:51,888
He’s been crunching numbers for two hours.

375
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,542
- He didn’t say anything? 
- No.

376
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:56,700
Mr. ‘I-want-four-in-four’ hears he can check off number one

377
00:13:56,777 --> 00:13:58,698
- and he says nothing? 
- Okay, not nothing.

378
00:13:58,815 --> 00:13:59,531
Thank you.

379
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:01,878
Every fifteen minutes, he says, ‘Oh, boy.’

380
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,332
‘Oh, boy’ like ‘Oh, boy!’?

381
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,954
No, ‘Oh, boy’ like ‘Oh, boy.’

382
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,465
Oh, boy.

383
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:08,519
Did you hear that?

384
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:11,325
- Maybe he’s in shock. 
- Oh, boy.

385
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,967
- Maybe. 
- Oh, boy.

386
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:16,537
Honey, I’d go in there and take that calculator away from him if I were you.

387
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:18,304
This wasn’t how it was supposed to go.

388
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:21,288
I know, sweetie, but give it time. It’s a big thing.

389
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:22,825
He said he wanted this.

390
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,104
He loves you, he wants this.

391
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,618
Oh, boy.

392
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,169
Hang in there, I’ll call you later.

393
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:30,306
I’ll be here.

394
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:35,886
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

395
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,773
- It’s right there! 
- Just a second.

396
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,676
- I see it. Can I just... 
- Yeah, I can do it.

397
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,684
- Kirk, it’s right there! 
- You are yelling at me,

398
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,998
and I have to tell you that that is not the way to get results.

399
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:59,308
- You keep passing it. 
- You are making me crazy.

400
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:02,221
Dean, I just need... oh, hey, that’s my water bill.

401
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,003
He’s been down there for twenty minutes.

402
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,010
Kirk, you have to sort the mail first.

403
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:07,878
Everybody is always telling me what to do.

404
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,338
Everybody else is always right.

405
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:12,302
I’m sorry, but I am the mail carrier in this town

406
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,796
and I will carry the mail the way that I carry the mail,

407
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:16,454
and if you don’t like that, then you can carry the mail.

408
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,938
But you’ll have to apply for the job first and get hired.

409
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:21,725
And there’s a test, and it is a hard test, my friend.

410
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:23,373
Ow, paper cut.

411
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,738
Dean, I need some of that non-drowsy allergy medicine stuff.

412
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:27,183
Did you check in the back with the aspirin?

413
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:28,012
Yeah, nothing.

414
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:29,164
Then we’re probably out.

415
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:32,026
I could tell you when they’re expected in, but I haven’t gotten the mail yet.

416
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,306
- Shut up. 
- Okay, nevermind,

417
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:35,053
I’ll just grab some when I get to Hartford.

418
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:36,408
See if you can get my water bill for me.

419
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:37,412
All right, I’ll do my best.

420
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:40,612
I’m giving you five minutes to get up, then I’m getting the mop.

421
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,725
You will not touch this.

422
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:43,833
This is the property of the United States Government.

423
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:58,641
Okay, show me a difference, people. Why can’t I pick one?

424
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:02,215
Ooh, on sale, that’s it, good, done.

425
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,309
- Max. 
- Lorelai.

426
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:06,302
- Hi. 
- Hi back.

427
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:08,442
I didn’t know you had a cold.

428
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,142
I just recently found out myself.

429
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,107
Well, wow. You.

430
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:13,475
Hi.

431
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,803
- How have you been? 
- I’ve been good.

432
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:17,540
Good.

433
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:20,050
- I’ve been in California. 
- cowabunga dude.

434
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,662
Yes, that’s my official California name.

435
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:23,773
So, California, huh?

436
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:25,580
Stanford, actually. I was teaching a class there.

437
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:28,073
Good. It’s about time that dump got some decent teachers.

438
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:30,152
Yes, they’re really trying to turn the place around.

439
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:33,033
So, if you were living in California,

440
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:34,136
then what are you doing back here?

441
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,158
Well, this place has the best selection.

442
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:37,161
In Hartford.

443
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:40,680
My class ended, and I thought I’d come back for the Chilton Bicentennial.

444
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,523
What are you doing here in Hartford?

445
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,049
Friday night?

446
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,319
The infamous Gilmore dinners.

447
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,908
- How’s that going? 
- Great.

448
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:50,868
We had to add on an extra room for all the emotional baggage,

449
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:52,938
but other than that, there’s been no bloodshed as of yet.

450
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:54,627
I’m glad to hear it. And Rory’s good?

451
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:58,483
Oh, yeah, she’s the Encyclopedia Britannica definition of good.

452
00:16:58,621 --> 00:16:59,845
- Grades? 
- Perfect.

453
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:01,949
- Same boyfriend? 
- Different boyfriend.

454
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:02,764
Really?

455
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,199
- You hate him. 
- No, I don’t.

456
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:06,277
You really hate him.

457
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,286
I smile, I say hi, I let him eat the good cookies.

458
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,849
You wanna have him killed.

459
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:12,215
Only if I get a really good price.

460
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,401
She’s young, she’ll move on, she’s got college next year.

461
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:17,341
Great. Frat boys, I cannot wait.

462
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:18,994
Just get a keg, keeps ‘em distracted.

463
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:20,563
Oh, thanks for the advice.

464
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:21,954
I’m gonna lock her up in a tower when I get home.

465
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:22,969
Glad I could help.

466
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:26,020
Well, listen, I have this dinner I have to get to.

467
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:26,992
Oh, yeah, yeah.

468
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:28,852
Me, too. Me, too.

469
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:30,772
- So... 
- It was nice to see you.

470
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,390
- It was nice to see you, too. 
- Bye.

471
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,082
Bye.

472
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,457
Ah, you’re here.

473
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:47,715
And you are by far the most masculine-looking maid

474
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:48,703
my parents have ever had.

475
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:51,422
It’s chaos here. The second maid called in sick,

476
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:54,156
the first is busy with dinner, and your poor mother is at the hospital.

477
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:56,630
Her DAR group suffered a surfeit of strokes this week.

478
00:17:56,764 --> 00:17:58,622
- Come again? 
- Three of her friends had strokes.

479
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:04,592
And now she is hopping from sick bed to sick bed offering whatever comfort she can.

480
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,803
Three DAR strokes. What’s in that water they’re drinking?

481
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:09,376
A little whiskey, usually.

482
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,853
- Oh, and you’re forgetting Liesl. 
- What?

483
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,420
Our East-German maid.

484
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,254
She was much more masculine-looking than me.

485
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:17,660
- Right, the muttonchops. 
- Here is Rory.

486
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:19,574
Thanks, I wouldn’t have recognized her. Hi hon.

487
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,142
Hi. Did you hear about the strokes?

488
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,447
Yes, stay away from whiskey and the DAR.

489
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:26,196
Your mother would make you throw that out at this point.

490
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,917
How about I exchange it for a martini?

491
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,002
Ah, coming up.

492
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,899
Oh, good I’m expecting an important call.

493
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:33,923
This could be it.

494
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:36,513
Dad, if the maid is busy with dinner

495
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:39,345
and the second one’s out and Mom’s at the hospital... you know.

496
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:41,393
Oh, right, right. I’ll get it!

497
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,926
Alone at last. Have I got something to tell you.

498
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,648
What?

499
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:47,686
Or maybe you have something to tell me.

500
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:48,859
Don’t do that, I have nothing.

501
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,464
Or are you minimizing what you know?

502
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,548
Maybe you should maximize it.

503
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:54,454
I’m confused.

504
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,442
Maximize it.

505
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:57,869
I’m maximum confused.

506
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:01,696
- I ran into Max. 
- Medina?

507
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:03,728
At the pharmacy. Did you know he was back?

508
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:05,586
No. He was, like, on loan somewhere.

509
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:06,595
Yeah, at Stanford.

510
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:08,362
But he’s back now, for a little while at least,

511
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:12,217
and I am happy to report that either he’s forgiven me for treating him so badly

512
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:14,541
or it wasn’t that bad and I just built it up worse in my head.

513
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,443
Oh no, you treated him like crap.

514
00:19:16,543 --> 00:19:18,403
Well, he was very big about it.

515
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:20,496
He didn’t recoil or blow me off.

516
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:23,134
We had a nice chat. It was good to see him.

517
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:24,475
He’s a great guy.

518
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:25,750
He is.

519
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,860
And a great teacher, too. I’m glad he’s back.

520
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:29,678
Good. He seems glad, too.

521
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:31,955
That was not my call, and for a second there,

522
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,974
I thought a fourth friend of your mother’s had had a stroke.

523
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:34,762
Oh, no.

524
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:36,027
But then I realized

525
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:39,017
that it was one of the original stroke ladies’ husband’s calling

526
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,310
to inform me of her stroke, which we already knew about, so here we are.

527
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:43,062
Thank God.

528
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:44,602
So, Rory has been telling me

529
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:47,014
about the Chilton Bicentennial and her speech.

530
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:50,072
Well, it’s not my speech yet. I have to qualify for it.

531
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:50,907
Oh, you’ll get it.

532
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:52,310
She’ll be on C-SPAN if she does.

533
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:53,435
Very good.

534
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,034
It’s not like anyone would watch it.

535
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,150
Yes, they will.

536
00:19:56,222 --> 00:19:58,464
You’re a hell of a lot more interesting than that usual shot they have

537
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:01,445
of all the white men walking around that big empty chamber

538
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:02,735
with the numbers all over them.

539
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:05,450
That’s a televised house vote, and I find that fascinating.

540
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:07,820
It’s like watching the Men’s Warehouse security camera.

541
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,442
When is your speech? I’d like to be there.

542
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,616
Again, it’s not my speech yet, but it’s Friday at five.

543
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,081
Oh, that’s tough.

544
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:16,401
Could they move it to six?

545
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,502
I don’t think so.

546
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:19,413
Well, maybe I’ll move my thing.

547
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,425
That might be best.

548
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,569
Oh, I’ve got it, I’ve got it, I’ve got it!

549
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,314
What?

550
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:28,207
Speed dial. I just like seeing him do that.

551
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:30,180
I’ve got it.

552
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:33,795
Ah, thank God, someone sane. Come on up.

553
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,838
Your phone has been busy all night

554
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:38,003
and I am dying to know what the doctor said.

555
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:41,163
He said, "Congratulations, it’s an It!"

556
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,965
Ah, I loved being pregnant.

557
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,378
You’ll give me lots of tips?

558
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:45,586
Oh, what I can remember.

559
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:48,090
Get your diary out from that year ‘cause I wanna know it all.

560
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:51,905
A lot of my diary from that year was a debate

561
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,914
over which member of Tears for Fears I loved more at that particular moment.

562
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,449
That’s probably not going to help me much.

563
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,159
What are you doing out here? It’s cold.

564
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,648
Well, we finished eating and I needed a break.

565
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:04,557
Rough day. We didn’t get home until eight.

566
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:05,869
Eight? Your appointment was at six.

567
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:08,623
Jackson won’t drive home faster than seven miles an hour.

568
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:10,283
He doesn’t wanna jiggle Baby.

569
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:11,598
Oh my God.

570
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:13,779
We spent ten minutes on one speed bump.

571
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:15,499
I could’ve walked home faster.

572
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:19,505
And he’s got this wild look in his eye like he’s some kind of death rocker or something,

573
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,077
and he’s making lots of calls,

574
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:23,314
and he punched the calculator so much he broke it.

575
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:25,479
- We’re selling the truck. 
- What?

576
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:27,349
It’s the only way we’re going to afford the minivan.

577
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,879
I thought you broke the calculator.

578
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:30,502
I’m using a pencil. Hi Lorelai.

579
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,029
Hi Jackson, congratulations.

580
00:21:32,156 --> 00:21:33,145
We don’t need a van.

581
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:35,258
And I’m getting a haircut and buying a second tie.

582
00:21:35,382 --> 00:21:36,868
Oh, I’ll get it. It’s probably the contractor.

583
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:37,784
What contractor?

584
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:39,550
- The add-on. 
- What add-on?

585
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:42,330
The expansion, Sookie, the expansion.

586
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:46,330
- He’s expanding something. 
- He’s being very cryptic.

587
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:49,095
I don’t wanna expand anything. And did you see his eyes?

588
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,395
Tasmanian devil.

589
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:52,468
When I came home, he was baby-proofing the house,

590
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:54,506
he’d thrown away all our prescription drugs,

591
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:58,054
and he was stuffing newspaper into the electrical sockets. He’s insane.

592
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:00,959
Hold on, Tom. He says we have to move out for three months to do the add-on.

593
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,176
We probably don’t wanna do that.

594
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,309
Probably not.

595
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:06,386
Have you tried slapping him?

596
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:09,678
No, he won’t let me lift my arm above my head in case it stretches Baby.

597
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,515
This stinks. We never even got to celebrate.

598
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:14,645
He went straight to budgets and minivans.

599
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:19,085
What he’s doing is sweet in its own obnoxious way.

600
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,167
I guess I’ll have to let him be male.

601
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:24,640
So, listen, I ran into Max Medina.

602
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:26,298
Oh my God, really?

603
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,579
How weird was that?

604
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:29,791
A little. Not as much as I would have thought.

605
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:30,985
He’s such a good guy.

606
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:32,863
Yeah, people are pretty unanimous on that.

607
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:34,301
Well, was he nice to you?

608
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,686
Very. I mean, what happened with us was so long ago.

609
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:39,882
Do you think what I did to him was really horrible?

610
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:41,455
You mean dumping him in the gutter? Sure.

611
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:43,641
Yeah, people are pretty unanimous on that, too.

612
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,362
So, Max Medina’s back.

613
00:22:45,526 --> 00:22:46,549
Not for long, though.

614
00:22:46,816 --> 00:22:49,371
I just hope he doesn’t hate me. He was probably just being nice.

615
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:50,815
I just don’t want him to hate me.

616
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:52,007
You didn’t mean to hurt him.

617
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:54,230
I’ll write him a note or something.

618
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,554
I owe him that.

619
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:59,525
- Oh! 
- What is this?

620
00:22:59,683 --> 00:23:02,519
- It’s my cleaver. 
- What if Baby fell on it?

621
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:05,577
You mean, what if Baby rolled off the sink

622
00:23:05,674 --> 00:23:08,419
and into the open second drawer?

623
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,178
- It wouldn’t be good. 
- It has to go.

624
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:12,658
I need it to chop stuff.

625
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,950
- We’re switching to plastic. 
- I can’t use plastic.

626
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:17,768
And the Saran Wrap’s history, too.

627
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:18,725
Jackson!

628
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,292
Hello?

629
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:29,217
- Rory Gilmore, please. 
- This is Rory Gilmore.

630
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:32,115
Please hold. I’m connecting Headmaster Charleston and Paris Gellar.

631
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,667
What? You’re what, hello?

632
00:23:33,907 --> 00:23:34,639
Miss Gilmore?

633
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:35,640
I’m here.

634
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:37,390
- Miss Gellar? 
- I’m here.

635
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:39,668
Please hold, I’m connecting Headmaster Charleston.

636
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:45,193
Miss Gilmore, Miss Gellar, you have Headmaster Charleston.

637
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,422
Ladies, hello.

638
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:47,876
I hope you’re having a pleasant evening.

639
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,396
- Yes, sir. 
- Very pleasant.

640
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:51,834
Wonderful to hear. Let’s get down to it, shall we?

641
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:54,598
I was very impressed with both of your speeches today.

642
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:57,778
They were well written, well researched, and eloquently delivered.

643
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,884
You should be very proud.

644
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:00,630
- Thank you, we were. 
- Who won?

645
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:04,665
Just the simple act of completing a task well is in itself a win,

646
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:06,472
- is it not Miss Gellar? 
- Yes, sir.

647
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:10,042
Wonderful. Anyhow, as I was listening to you both this afternoon,

648
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:11,839
a thought kept rolling around in my head.

649
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:14,880
I was thinking what a pity it is I will have to choose just one.

650
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:17,399
But then I realized, ‘Hold on a minute here.

651
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:20,348
I’m the headmaster at this school, I’m in charge of this competition,

652
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:22,693
I can change the rules if I wish to.’

653
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:24,579
- So I am. 
- You are?

654
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:25,500
You are what?

655
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,132
I am changing the rules.

656
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:31,341
Instead of having one speaker at our bicentennial, we will have two.

657
00:24:31,587 --> 00:24:34,460
You will combine your speeches and present them together.

658
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,257
- You’re kidding. 
- I assure you I am not.

659
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:39,145
I think it will be an excellent way to pay proper tribute to our school.

660
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:41,251
So, what do you think of my little plan?

661
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:42,356
- Well... 
- It’s...

662
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,199
Brilliant. Yes, I think so, too.

663
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:45,898
That’s all. Congratulations.

664
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:50,364
I would like the revised copy of your speech on my desk by Tuesday.

665
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:52,622
Enjoy the rest of your weekend.

666
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:56,902
Well, look who’s suddenly decided to become Kofi Annan.

667
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:57,686
Excuse me?

668
00:24:57,808 --> 00:24:59,615
Charleston thinks we need to play nice with each other,

669
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:02,202
so he screws up the whole bicentennial. This sucks.

670
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,876
Yes, it does suck.

671
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:04,777
So, what do we do now?

672
00:25:04,946 --> 00:25:05,888
Do we have a choice?

673
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:08,168
Of course we have a choice. You could say no.

674
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:10,368
Why could I say no? You could say no.

675
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:12,740
I could not say no. C-SPAN is going to be there.

676
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,813
Well, I like C-SPAN as much as you do.

677
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:16,252
- You do not. 
- I do, too.

678
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:18,028
Ask my mom, it’s all I talk about.

679
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,410
So, I guess we need a game plan now.

680
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:27,204
Okay. We can meet at school tomorrow and work on it.

681
00:25:27,312 --> 00:25:28,500
Or we could do it over the phone.

682
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:29,468
Over the phone?

683
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:31,561
We’re just combining two speeches, Rory.

684
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,132
There’s no reason we have to sit in the same room and stare at each other.

685
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,294
Fine, whatever you want.

686
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:37,711
Tomorrow night, six o’clock, I’ll call you.

687
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,780
I can’t wait.

688
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,388
- What are you doing here? 
- We have a speech to write.

689
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,559
Yes, but we were supposed to do it over the phone. That was the plan.

690
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:54,735
It’s a ridiculous plan. We have to put two speeches together.

691
00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:56,657
We have to rehearse them, we have to hone our timing.

692
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:58,463
None of that can be done effectively over the phone.

693
00:25:58,552 --> 00:26:00,230
- But it was your idea. 
- Oh, like you fought me on it?

694
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:02,202
- Of course I didn’t fight you on it. 
- Okay then.

695
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:05,032
What, okay then?

696
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:07,096
Our conversation did not just come to a close.

697
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,026
There was not a decision made back there just now.

698
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,596
Look, I’m here, we should just do this and get it over with.

699
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,302
Do you wanna study here or in your bedroom?

700
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:15,351
Fine, I’ll go to a payphone.

701
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:18,074
Do you have payphones in this town or are you still using a town crier?

702
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,796
- We’ll do it here. 
- Whatever you say.

703
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:25,847
So, I think the first thing to do is to acquaint ourselves

704
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:29,082
with each others’ speeches so we can judge who hit which point best.

705
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:31,679
Here.

706
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:34,899
Mine.

707
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,179
Good. Let’s read.

708
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,396
- Why did you use this font? 
- Because I was on the crack.

709
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:41,541
- Did you check these facts? 
- Yes, I did.

710
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:43,589
- And the spelling of these names? 
- Yes, I did.

711
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:45,401
- Rory? 
- What, Paris?

712
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:46,672
I slept with Jamie.

713
00:26:48,146 --> 00:26:49,549
Last night, after we talked.

714
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:51,459
Was it something I said?

715
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:53,978
I went over there to study and he lit a fire and then we did it.

716
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:56,006
- What are your thoughts on that? 
- My thoughts?

717
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:58,222
Because I’m not exactly sure how I feel about it myself yet.

718
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:02,535
I’ve been going over it in my head.

719
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,199
I mean, it seemed to go pretty well.

720
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:07,905
The fire was nice and thank God he didn’t try to put on any ridiculous makeout music,

721
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:10,604
and then it just happened. I was actually fairly surprised

722
00:27:10,691 --> 00:27:13,523
at the timing of it because I wasn’t wearing anything particularly alluring,

723
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:15,505
and in the moments just before the act...

724
00:27:15,704 --> 00:27:16,395
Oh, God.

725
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:18,658
We were actually discussing modern day Marxism in America,

726
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:21,530
which is not what I would have deemed a ‘come and get it’ sort of conversation,

727
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:23,282
but nevertheless, he came and got it,

728
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,744
and I have to figure out what that means to me on a psychological level.

729
00:27:25,903 --> 00:27:28,924
So, I thought maybe if you and I could have sort of a healthy debate about it,

730
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:31,127
I could come to some sort of reasonable conclusion

731
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,102
about how I should be feeling right about now.

732
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,058
So, come on, talk.

733
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:36,012
What do you think?

734
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:37,384
- I... 
- Are you pro?

735
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:38,669
- Well... 
- Con?

736
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,082
- Well... 
- Undecided?

737
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:45,602
Paris, just stop talking for one second and let me get my mind around this.

738
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:47,444
Sorry, go ahead, focus.

739
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:52,836
Could you focus faster because I really need some feedback here.

740
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:57,490
Okay, so you are telling me that you and Jamie...

741
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:58,601
Had sex.

742
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:01,653
Okay, so, were you safe?

743
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:03,691
Yes, it was a regular after school special.

744
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:05,924
Well, was he nice to you?

745
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:07,527
Yes, he was very nice to me.

746
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,175
And the two of you had discussed this...

747
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,376
Well, I don’t know that we actually discussed it,

748
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:13,732
it was just sort of implied.

749
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,396
- Implied? 
- Yes, implied.

750
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,475
When you’re dating a boy and you’re together for a given amount of time

751
00:28:18,582 --> 00:28:21,425
and you’re not Amish, then the eventual occurrence of intercourse is inevitable.

752
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:24,561
- I mean, wasn’t it with you? 
- What?

753
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:25,887
- With Dean. 
- No.

754
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:28,434
- No? 
- No. I never did it with Dean.

755
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:31,326
Oh. Well, then with Jess, right?

756
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,764
Um, no.

757
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:35,990
- You’re lying. 
- No, I’m not lying.

758
00:28:36,754 --> 00:28:37,824
- You haven’t? 
- No.

759
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:38,740
Why not?

760
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:40,635
I just haven’t.

761
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,924
It’s just not the time.

762
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,847
Why is it not the time? I mean, if it’s not the time for you,

763
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:47,419
then maybe it’s not the time for me either.

764
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:50,480
Paris, you can’t judge what’s right for you against what’s right for me.

765
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:53,179
I mean, we are different, and Jamie and Jess are different.

766
00:28:53,318 --> 00:28:54,060
Well, yeah.

767
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:56,964
Maybe it was the time for the two of you.

768
00:28:57,106 --> 00:28:57,946
I guess.

769
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,214
I just wish I had the data to back it up.

770
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:01,849
Some things can’t be analyzed.

771
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:04,209
Listen, Rory,

772
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:06,467
these last few weeks,

773
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,822
Francie got things all twisted around.

774
00:29:09,088 --> 00:29:11,028
You let her get things all twisted around.

775
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:11,966
I know.

776
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:15,197
I just tend to believe the worst in people, you know?

777
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:16,882
Oh yeah, I know.

778
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:18,935
I’m...

779
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,345
That’s okay.

780
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:23,613
Hello, Mommy’s home!

781
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:24,623
We’re in here.

782
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:25,980
We’re, who’s we’re?

783
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:28,499
Oh, hey Paris. I didn’t know you were coming over tonight.

784
00:29:28,652 --> 00:29:29,574
It wasn’t planned.

785
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,571
Oh, I brought pizza if you guys are hungry.

786
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,415
I have to take my retainer out first.

787
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:35,592
I’ll get the plates.

788
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:40,589
I’m taking you shopping tomorrow.

789
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:41,592
Why?

790
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:43,859
It just seems time...

791
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,043
for new shoes.

792
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,103
Okay.

793
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:52,007
I’ve got the good kid.

794
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:56,156
... of two hundred years of tradition,

795
00:29:56,264 --> 00:30:00,067
Chilton begins its third century of educating this country’s young students...

796
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,279
Okay, I got the coats hung,

797
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:04,732
and I slipped the girl a buck to get the really good hangers.

798
00:30:04,814 --> 00:30:06,725
You know, the ones with the dry cleaning foam strips still attached.

799
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:07,933
Why are you frowning? Are you nervous?

800
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,541
What? No. I mean, yes.

801
00:30:09,694 --> 00:30:11,931
Paris is supposed to be here and she’s not.

802
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:14,871
Well, maybe she’s just had a clothing crisis.

803
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:15,726
Maybe.

804
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:18,173
- Do you wanna call her? 
- I did, no answer.

805
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:20,902
I’m sure she’s fine, there’s traffic. Just relax.

806
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:21,829
Okay.

807
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:23,314
- There you are. 
- Hi.

808
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:25,137
- Grandpa, you came. 
- Of course I came.

809
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:27,682
I wouldn’t miss my granddaughter talking on national TV.

810
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,176
That’s quite a nice turnout you have here.

811
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:32,413
Yes, we’re very proud of the number of people

812
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:33,596
who have nothing to do on a Friday night.

813
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:36,171
Your mind never tires for a moment, does it?

814
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:37,538
It will once people start talking.

815
00:30:37,697 --> 00:30:38,517
Charming.

816
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:40,615
Okay, I’m gonna go track down some coffee

817
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,752
‘cause there’s no way they’re not serving coffee at this thing.

818
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:45,039
I’ll be right back. Relax, she’ll be here.

819
00:30:46,264 --> 00:30:48,122
Stanford has been really fantastic.

820
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:53,488
- Will you excuse me for a moment? 
- Sure.

821
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:56,596
We seem to be running into each other a lot lately.

822
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:59,612
Oh, come on, you know where there’s C-SPAN, there’s...

823
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:01,174
me.

824
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:04,154
Is Rory around?

825
00:31:04,758 --> 00:31:07,350
She’s looking for Paris and panicking she’s gonna have to do this alone.

826
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:08,752
Paris’ll come.

827
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,052
I told her that.

828
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:12,360
Listen, do you have a second?

829
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:13,596
Sure.

830
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:15,162
I just...

831
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:18,271
I just wanna talk to you about...

832
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:24,743
I just wanted to get away from...

833
00:31:25,475 --> 00:31:26,802
anyhow.

834
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:32,388
We just haven’t really talked since...

835
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,876
No, we haven’t.

836
00:31:37,348 --> 00:31:39,078
I always meant to call you, but...

837
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:42,439
I’m not good at calling when a call is really necessary.

838
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:44,768
And then, you know...

839
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:48,163
if you don’t call for awhile, it gets harder to call,

840
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,795
and then after awhile, it feels like it’s too late to call,

841
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:53,883
and so you don’t, although you always know that you should’ve called,

842
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:55,680
- and I should’ve called. 
- It’s okay.

843
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:59,110
No, it’s not. I never really explained what happened.

844
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:00,513
You didn’t marry me.

845
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:03,924
Yes, I know, but I never really explained why.

846
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:06,295
- I just didn’t. 
- You didn’t love me.

847
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:09,135
I don’t think I didn’t love you. I think...

848
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:11,736
I think I was not ready to get married.

849
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,369
Because you didn’t love me.

850
00:32:13,595 --> 00:32:15,705
No, I really don’t think that was it.

851
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,392
Sometimes the person you love is not the person you’re ready to live with forever.

852
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:22,571
- I’m not saying this is right, but... 
- Lorelai, listen to me.

853
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:26,329
I appreciate this, I really do, but there’s no need for it.

854
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:28,639
I’m really okay.

855
00:32:28,773 --> 00:32:30,823
Oh, no, I know you’re... no, I’m sure you’re okay.

856
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:33,160
I’m not saying this because you don’t look okay.

857
00:32:33,974 --> 00:32:36,381
You look great. Really great.

858
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:39,474
Although, I’m not saying this because you look really great, although you do.

859
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,798
Did you join a gym in California?

860
00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:45,597
Lorelai, look. I’ve always wanted to teach at a university like Stanford.

861
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:50,175
And finally, the opportunity came up, I went, and it was wonderful.

862
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:52,305
And, frankly, if we had been getting married,

863
00:32:52,412 --> 00:32:53,801
I wouldn’t have been able to take it.

864
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,050
You’re welcome.

865
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,908
And being away gave me time to think.

866
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,638
I thought, and now I’m fine.

867
00:32:59,883 --> 00:33:01,850
It’s just, we never had any closure.

868
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:04,333
Life’s not really about closure, is it?

869
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:05,767
No, I guess not.

870
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:08,685
So, you’re okay?

871
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,339
I’m okay. I’m over it.

872
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:13,073
- You sure? 
- I am completely sure.

873
00:33:13,473 --> 00:33:14,419
Well, then...

874
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:16,663
boy, don’t I feel stupid.

875
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:19,065
You are many things, but stupid is not one of ‘em.

876
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:22,961
I’m really glad I got to see you again.

877
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:24,035
Me, too.

878
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,829
- I better get back. 
- Okay.

879
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:35,813
Rory, you and Paris should get ready, you’re going on next.

880
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:38,132
Richard, I didn’t know you were coming, how are you?

881
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,269
Very, very well, Hanlin.

882
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:40,775
Wonderful. Here, let me find you a seat.

883
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:41,973
Ah, I’m also with my daughter.

884
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,380
Then let me find you two seats.

885
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:44,998
Rory, where’s Paris?

886
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:47,015
I don’t know, I haven’t seen her and I called her house.

887
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:49,259
Oh, dear. Well, I hope you know both parts.

888
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,558
Okay, great.

889
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:53,539
You are going to be wonderful, trust me.

890
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:57,697
Now, did anyone ever to tell you to picture the audience in their underwear?

891
00:33:57,795 --> 00:33:59,223
- Yes. 
- Well, don’t do it.

892
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,196
I did it once and I had nightmares for a week.

893
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:03,428
- Bulgarians in Speedos. 
- Say no more.

894
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,450
Hey, they’re rounding us up.

895
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:06,051
- Is she here yet? 
- No.

896
00:34:06,158 --> 00:34:07,415
Oh, just... oh, there she is.

897
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,060
Where? Oh, thank you God.

898
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,098
Okay, be great. We’ll see you afterward.

899
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:14,252
Where have you been? Paris, you okay?

900
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:19,198
And it is with great pleasure that I introduce two young ladies

901
00:34:19,243 --> 00:34:22,249
that epitomize the very best of what Chilton has to offer.

902
00:34:22,423 --> 00:34:23,602
Paris, are you okay?

903
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:24,420
Ladies and Gentlemen,

904
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:26,922
I give you Paris Gellar and Rory Gilmore.

905
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:41,885
"Apply yourself.

906
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:45,044
Get all the education you can, but then do something.

907
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:47,140
Don’t just stand there, make it happen."

908
00:34:47,672 --> 00:34:48,659
Lee Iacocca.

909
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,436
"Education’s purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one."

910
00:34:57,938 --> 00:34:58,998
Malcolm Forbes.

911
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:06,853
"Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember

912
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:10,456
from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught."

913
00:35:10,979 --> 00:35:11,988
Oscar Wilde.

914
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:15,890
These are only three of many countless views on the expansion of the human mind.

915
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:17,723
I personally believe in all of them,

916
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:20,754
and fortunately for me, so does Chilton.

917
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,206
An institution not just because of age and standing,

918
00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:24,472
but because of ideas.

919
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,652
Because it encourages ideas and it will accept nothing less

920
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:29,197
than everything you have to give.

921
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:31,743
This is the place where our lives start.

922
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,217
You know, it’s funny,

923
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:38,793
me standing here before you right now.

924
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:40,451
I’ve thought about nothing else

925
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:42,742
for four years but this school,

926
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:46,402
this big important school

927
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:48,880
with all of its history

928
00:35:49,003 --> 00:35:52,786
and tradition and really super teachers.

929
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,156
And I dedicated myself to it completely,

930
00:35:57,129 --> 00:35:58,200
heart and soul,

931
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:00,053
believing in its power,

932
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:03,791
believing in its ability to get me where I needed to go.

933
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:05,291
Harvard.

934
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,128
I thought of nothing else.

935
00:36:08,942 --> 00:36:11,569
Many of you out there can attest to that fact.

936
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:14,410
I was on my way and nothing could stop me.

937
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,508
And here’s the really funny thing,

938
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:20,648
after four years of slaving away,

939
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:23,827
I go home today and I found this.

940
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:28,204
I’m not going to Harvard.

941
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:30,135
I got the tiny envelope,

942
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:32,008
the one that reads,

943
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:34,903
"Sorry, Paris. We’re not interested.

944
00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:37,518
Try again next year. Love, Harvard."

945
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:41,087
And the thing that’s really funny here is,

946
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,958
who in the world deserves to go to Harvard more than me?

947
00:36:45,778 --> 00:36:48,752
Have you seen how hard I’ve worked over these past four years?

948
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,762
I mean, can anyone here believe that I’m not going to Harvard?

949
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:53,899
I can’t.

950
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,931
I’m not going to Harvard.

951
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:57,933
I am not going to Harvard.

952
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,053
I had sex, but I’m not going to Harvard.

953
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:00,835
Okay.

954
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:02,772
And I have to tell you that if you asked me

955
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:06,043
which of those two events I thought would be the least likely to happen,

956
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:08,026
it would not be the not going to Harvard.

957
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:09,663
Thank you and good night.

958
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:13,028
I’m being punished. I had sex, so now I don’t get to go to Harvard.

959
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:13,754
Paris, come on.

960
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:15,809
She’s never had sex. She’ll probably go to Harvard.

961
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,009
She’s a shoe in. Pack your chastity belt, Gilmore – you’re going to Harvard!

962
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:19,888
Come on!

963
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,520
How could I have not gotten into Harvard?

964
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,858
Five generations of Gellars have gotten into Harvard.

965
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,618
Even if I was the Billy Carter of the family,

966
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:34,943
the name is still supposed to carry some weight.

967
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:36,019
Paris.

968
00:37:36,238 --> 00:37:38,598
They had to really not like me for me to not get in.

969
00:37:38,711 --> 00:37:40,959
- It’s like they know me or something. 
- Stop.

970
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:44,580
I know how much this meant to you, Paris,

971
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:47,416
but you are going to get just as good an education

972
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:50,206
at one of the other great schools you’re destined to get into.

973
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:52,715
And you know what?

974
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:55,614
Maybe it’s a good thing that you’re going to a different school

975
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:56,985
than the rest of your family.

976
00:37:57,231 --> 00:38:00,483
You’ll be doing your own thing, starting your own tradition.

977
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:01,634
Doesn’t that sound exciting?

978
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:03,791
I can’t believe I slept with Jamie.

979
00:38:04,563 --> 00:38:05,464
I’m a slut.

980
00:38:05,638 --> 00:38:08,331
No, you’re not. You love him.

981
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:09,918
What if he doesn’t love me anymore?

982
00:38:10,826 --> 00:38:13,227
What if he doesn’t think I’m special anymore?

983
00:38:13,984 --> 00:38:16,299
How am I going to tell him I didn’t get into Harvard?

984
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:18,071
What am I gonna do?

985
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:22,864
Paris, I don’t know why you didn’t get into Harvard,

986
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,378
but you are so smart

987
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,044
and so special and you’ll see, everything’s gonna be fine.

988
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:33,913
Hey, I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.

989
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:36,627
Yeah, we’ve got everything under control, thanks.

990
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:39,760
Okay. I’ll be outside when you’re ready. No rush.

991
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:40,676
Thanks.

992
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:45,127
Well, all I’ve gotta say is,

993
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:48,341
after all the trouble this sex thing has caused me,

994
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,437
I better have been good.

995
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:55,234
That’s the perspective I know and love.

996
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,723
Dad, hi, sorry. I was just checking on the girls.

997
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:02,735
Well, I hope they’re feeling very good about themselves.

998
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:03,878
They did a wonderful job.

999
00:39:04,138 --> 00:39:06,298
Yes, I’m sure they’ll be very pleased to hear you think so.

1000
00:39:06,447 --> 00:39:08,748
Listen, I need to get home.

1001
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:13,509
I’m expecting a very important call from China that unfortunately I cannot miss.

1002
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:15,454
That’s fine, Dad. I’ll tell Rory you had to go.

1003
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:18,255
All right. And tell her I’ll call her later, and give her this.

1004
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:21,808
That’s very nice. Now how about my finder’s fee?

1005
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:24,318
You’re very amusing. Thank you for a lovely evening,

1006
00:39:24,415 --> 00:39:26,126
and I’ll see the two of you on Friday.

1007
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,477
Good night. Sleep tight.

1008
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:32,167
Excuse me, hi. I am not seeing my coat here,

1009
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:34,374
and it was very cute and it was on sale,

1010
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,360
and I will fling myself off a building if I lose it.

1011
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,757
We put some of the coat racks in the classroom over there,

1012
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:41,486
take a look. Otherwise the staircase to the roof is on your right.

1013
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,980
Thank you.

1014
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:48,004
Took two hundred years, but somebody at Chilton finally cracked a joke.

1015
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,526
Okay.

1016
00:39:57,462 --> 00:40:00,881
So, this is where they keep the coats they’re ashamed of.

1017
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:03,540
Well, this school has taken snobbery to a whole new level.

1018
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,362
So, is Rory okay?

1019
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:06,653
Oh, yeah, I just went back there.

1020
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,530
She’s taking care of Paris, but she’s good, thanks.

1021
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:12,065
I must say, I’ve been a teacher for ten years now,

1022
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:15,977
and it wasn’t until today I realized, it must be really hard to be a girl.

1023
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,217
And with the invention of Sephora, really expensive, too.

1024
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:20,962
- I’m very sorry. 
- Oh, don’t be.

1025
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:24,337
At least we get to wear skirts without being Scottish

1026
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:26,356
or riding a float in the gay pride parade.

1027
00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:27,804
That’ll change someday my friend,

1028
00:40:27,902 --> 00:40:29,760
and when it does, I still won’t wear a skirt.

1029
00:40:29,913 --> 00:40:31,240
But I’ll applaud those that do,

1030
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:33,390
and then cross the street so nobody sees I’m with them.

1031
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,047
- It was nice seeing you. 
- Nice to see you, too.

1032
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,074
- Take care of yourself. 
- I will.

1033
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:53,647
And apparently, I’m not over it.

1034
00:41:05,874 --> 00:41:07,789
I’m not getting rid of my knives, Jackson.

1035
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:09,725
I’m a chef, I have to have knives.

1036
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:12,782
And I’m also not cutting off the water supply

1037
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:15,829
and I’m not sanding down all the edges of my furniture.

1038
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:18,583
Now, I’m sorry that you think this house is a deathtrap,

1039
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:21,153
and I’m sorry that you think there is nothing in our lifestyles

1040
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:22,874
that is conducive to having a baby,

1041
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,545
but our kid is gonna have to be bright enough not to disconnect the water hose

1042
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:30,308
that goes to the automatic ice maker and shove it up his or her nose.

1043
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:32,987
Now go to sleep.

1044
00:41:41,322 --> 00:41:42,986
Did I tell you how happy I am?

1045
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:46,212
No, you didn’t.

1046
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:56,180
I have never been happier about anything in my entire life.

1047
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:57,426
Really?

1048
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,174
Our wedding day, but this is running a really close second.

1049
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,669
Jackson.

1050
00:42:07,308 --> 00:42:08,910
Now if you would just get rid of the knives,

1051
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:10,463
I think it could make it a tie.

1052
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:14,359
I wasn’t kidding about the knives.

1053
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:16,933
Goodnight Jackson.

1054
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:21,215
If I could read you the statistics just one more time.

1055
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:23,079
I love you, Jackson.

1056
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:25,136
Hold on, I’ll find them.

1057
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:27,102
- But... 
- I don’t know.

1058
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:28,239
What does this mean?

1059
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:29,765
I don’t know.

1060
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,897
- What are you gonna do? 
- I don’t know.

1061
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:33,262
What about Alex?

1062
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:34,784
I don’t know.

1063
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:36,463
But is Max going to...

1064
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:37,871
Oh, honey, have you gotten the clue?

1065
00:42:37,953 --> 00:42:39,505
There’s not gonna be a wealth of information tonight.

1066
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:40,324
Sorry.

1067
00:42:42,178 --> 00:42:43,179
It’s just so...

1068
00:42:55,812 --> 00:42:56,658
The big one.

1069
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:02,280
Looks like Paris was right.

1070
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,674
Apparently, you are the biggest virgin in the world.

1071
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:16,827
So, what?

1072
00:43:18,117 --> 00:43:18,971
I don’t know.

1073
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,749
Well, what does this mean?

1074
00:43:20,942 --> 00:43:21,696
I don’t know.

1075
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,104
Which one are you gonna choose?

1076
00:43:23,386 --> 00:43:24,271
I don’t know.

1077
00:43:24,456 --> 00:43:25,618
I guess we better go inside.

1078
00:43:26,074 --> 00:43:28,179
We both have a lot of things to figure out, huh?

1079
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:34,907
So what are the odds that Paris is ever gonna have sex again in this lifetime?

1080
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:35,991
I don’t know.
