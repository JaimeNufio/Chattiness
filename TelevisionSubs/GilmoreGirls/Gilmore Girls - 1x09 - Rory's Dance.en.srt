1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,756
Your grandfather called
and told me to tell you...

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,634
he's bringing you back
something very special from Prague.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,220
How amazing is it
that he's going to Prague?

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,931
It's supposed to be lovely.
Dramatic castles everywhere.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,892
The cell that Vaclav Havel was held in
is now a hostel.

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,936
You can stay there for $50 a night.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,147
Maybe on our trip to Europe
we could go there and stay in his cell.

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,149
Absolutely. Then we should go to Turkey...

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,276
and stay in that place
from Midnight Express.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,029
- Lorelai, what are you doing?
- Getting rid of the avocado.

11
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,864
Since when do you not like avocado?

12
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:35,202
Since the day I said, 'Gross. What is this?'
And you said, 'Avocado. '

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,828
I'm focusing on you now.

14
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,498
Tell me all about
the Chilton formal next week.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,666
There's a formal?

16
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,418
- How do you know about the formal?
- Yeah, how do you know?

17
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,672
- I read my Chilton newsletter.
- Since when do you get a newsletter?

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,508
As a major contributor
to Rory's education...

19
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,803
I figured I had the right to ask for
a newsletter to be sent to me.

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,887
Are you serious?

21
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,223
It's a good thing, too,
since you don't read yours.

22
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,142
One of us should be up-to-date
on the goings-on at her school.

23
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,395
Mom, I read my newsletter.

24
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,938
- You did?
- That's right.

25
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,815
What was the picture on the cover?

26
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,527
It was a picture of a really rich kid in plaid.

27
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,447
- It's a spotted owl.
- In plaid.

28
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:16,201
The owls are endangered, and Chilton
is taking donations to help them.

29
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,578
You gave a very nice one,
in case you're interested.

30
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:22,249
Don't be giving donations on Rory's behalf.
I'll do that.

31
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,501
How can you
when you don't read the newsletter?

32
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,794
I read it.

33
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,713
You didn't know
they were taking donations.

34
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,341
It's a private school. They always
take donations. I'll get them next time.

35
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,135
- What about the owls?
- They'll live.

36
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,513
Apparently they won't, dear.
That's why they need the donations.

37
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,850
- You have a formal coming up?
- Yeah, but I don't think I'm gonna go.

38
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,435
Nonsense. Of course you're going.

39
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,396
Mom, if Rory doesn't wanna go,
she doesn't have to go.

40
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,606
I don't understand
why she wouldn't wanna go.

41
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,066
I know you don't.

42
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,360
I'm gonna go get another Coke.

43
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,406
- What did you say to her?
- What are you talking about?

44
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,242
If she doesn't wanna go,
it's because of something you said.

45
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,786
Mom, I promise.
All I ever said to her about dances...

46
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,331
is that you go, dance, have punch,
eat, you take a picture...

47
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,334
and then you get auctioned off
to a biker gang from Sausalito.

48
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,088
- Lorelai, this is serious.
- Mom, I said nothing, okay?

49
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,216
Rory's disdain of formals
is totally her own.

50
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,469
Let's just drop it, please.

51
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,179
- Fine.
- Fine.

52
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,895
- What's wrong with the tomato?
- It was fraternizing with the enemy.

53
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,567
- Why didn't you mention the dance?
- Because I'm not going.

54
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,487
But why aren't you going?

55
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,239
- Because I hate dances.
- Good answer.

56
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,660
Except you've never
actually been to a dance.

57
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,038
- So?
- So you have nothing to compare it to.

58
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,290
- No, but I can imagine it.
- That's true.

59
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,293
However, not really,
since you've never actually been to one.

60
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,796
You're basing all your dance opinions
on one viewing of Sixteen Candles.

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,424
You should have a decent reason
for hating something...

62
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,218
before you really decide you hate it.

63
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,305
Trust me, I'll hate it. It'll be stuffy
and boring, and the music will suck.

64
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,307
Since none of the kids at school like me...

65
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,893
I'll be standing in the back
listening to 98 Degrees...

66
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,438
watching Tristan and Paris argue over
who gets to make me miserable first.

67
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,857
Okay. Or it'll be all sparkly and exciting.

68
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,443
You'll be on the dance floor
listening to Tom Waits...

69
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,946
with some great-looking guy
staring at you so hard...

70
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,115
you don't realize that
Paris and Tristan were just eaten by bears.

71
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,200
What guy?

72
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,286
Maybe the guy who hangs out
in our trees all day waiting for you.

73
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,913
Dean does not hang out in trees.

74
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,041
He bashed his head in a branch
when I came out too quickly.

75
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,336
- Why do you care all of a sudden if I go?
- I don't care if you go.

76
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,215
I just don't want you to miss on
any experience because you're too afraid.

77
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,759
I'm afraid? Of what?

78
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,804
Of asking Dean, of him saying no...

79
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,349
of going to a dance with a bunch of kids
who haven't accepted you yet...

80
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,850
of dancing in public...

81
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,561
of finding out
you should never be dancing in public.

82
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,480
Okay, I get it.

83
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,150
Listen, I know you are not Miss Party Girl,
and I love you for that...

84
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,861
but sometimes I wonder.

85
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:01,032
Do you not join in
because you really don't want to...

86
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,159
or because you're too shy?

87
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,037
If you don't wanna go
because you really don't wanna go...

88
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:10,208
and not because you are in any way afraid,
then this is the last time I'll mention it.

89
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,668
I promise.

90
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,546
I don't have a dress.

91
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,841
I could make you one.

92
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,217
- Really?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,845
We could get some great shoes,
and some new earrings.

94
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,723
- We could get your hair done.
- You won't think I'm an idiot?

95
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,725
It depends on what hairstyle you choose.

96
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,227
This dance could be great for you.

97
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,120
He's gonna say no.

98
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,706
- Why would he say no?
- Why would he say yes?

99
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:36,252
There's no point in having a boyfriend
if he won't go to the dance with you.

100
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,670
He's not my boyfriend.

101
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,005
- Really?
- No.

102
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,050
- What is he then?
- He's my gentleman caller.

103
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,635
Okay, Blanche.

104
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,930
I don't know what he is,
but he's not a boyfriend.

105
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,932
Do you think he's my boyfriend?

106
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:53,102
You guys spend a lot of time not kissing
other people, if it isn't that sort of thing.

107
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,437
- Girlfriend.
- You.

108
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,064
- Boyfriend.
- Him.

109
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,358
No, it sounds weird.

110
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:02,612
- Have you had the talk yet?
- Yes, Lane. Babies come from the stork.

111
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,114
- The other talk.
- What other talk?

112
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,493
'We've been dating a few weeks now.
Where do we stand?

113
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,079
'If another girl asks you out,
do you feel free to go?'

114
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,956
How do you know so much about this?

115
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,792
Those who can, do.
Those who can't, teach.

116
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,170
There he is.

117
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,840
- I should do this later.
- No. You have to do this now.

118
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,968
- Why?
- Because I have to go home soon...

119
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,887
and my mom threw out our TV
when she caught me watching V.I.P.

120
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,598
So I'm bored,
and I need some entertainment.

121
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,851
- Okay, here I go.
- Good luck.

122
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,480
And remember to enunciate.
I'm reading lips out here.

123
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,488
You're busy.

124
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,741
Yeah, I have to put the new
green bean shipment on the shelves.

125
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,952
- You wanna help?
- Yeah, sure.

126
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,912
I love stacking beans.

127
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,248
Okay, follow me.

128
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:59,002
- Do you work on Saturdays? I forget.
- It depends.

129
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,546
Sometimes I come in
if I don't have any plans.

130
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,381
- Why?
- No reason.

131
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,051
There's this thing at my school
on Saturday.

132
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:11,014
It's not really at my school,
but it's kind of given by my school.

133
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,432
What is it?

134
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,769
It's this kind of thing where you go,
and they play music...

135
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,106
and you get dressed up and dance,
and then there's chicken.

136
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,150
- Chicken?
- I don't know if there's chicken.

137
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,570
But at these kinds of things
they often serve chicken...

138
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,864
because it's probably cheaper
and people eat it.

139
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,200
So the logic behind the chicken choice
really isn't that bad.

140
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,286
- I'm lost.
- It's a dance.

141
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,333
It's not like I'm dying to go or anything,
but it is a new school...

142
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,920
and being a part of the social activities
is really important at Chilton.

143
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,840
So are you asking me
to go to a dance with you?

144
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,966
No.

145
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,971
Yes. I mean, if you wanted to go,
I would go, too.

146
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,849
That would probably be good
since it's your school.

147
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,100
Right.

148
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,770
So do you wanna go?

149
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,480
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

150
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,026
I've actually never gone to a dance before.

151
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,736
Because they're lame?

152
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,530
Yeah, and it's not the way
I ever wanted to spend my time.

153
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,407
I'm not a big joiner.

154
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,327
Okay, fair enough. More beans, please.

155
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,795
- You wanna go, don't you?
- No, I don't.

156
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,965
I have no desire to go at all.
I was just thinking out loud, that's all.

157
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,677
- So what would I have to wear?
- What?

158
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,889
To this dance. What would I have to wear?

159
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,432
- Anything you want.
- Come on.

160
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,768
Really, whatever
you're comfortable in is fine.

161
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,895
Some sort of pants would be good.

162
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,772
- It's coat and tie.
- Oh, man.

163
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,359
But you could probably get away with
a coat and no tie.

164
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,152
Okay.

165
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,737
- Really?
- Yeah.

166
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,535
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

167
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,397
- Extra thread.
- God bless!

168
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,816
I've been working so hard
to finish Rory's dress...

169
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,234
I haven't been able to get out.

170
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,319
- You are walking funny.
- I know.

171
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,948
Rory's dress made a pass at me,
and I think I pulled something getting up.

172
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,660
Here, sit. I got an ACE Bandage in my bag.

173
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,372
I'm not sure how we can wrap it,
but maybe we can do something creative.

174
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,833
- Sookie.
- Let's see.

175
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,631
Okay, I got Percodan, Vicodin,
Darvocet, and...

176
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,510
Take this one. It's a muscle-relaxer.
Very mild, I promise.

177
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,387
Thanks. Maybe later.

178
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,640
I've gotta go.
You sure you're gonna be okay?

179
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,309
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

180
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,019
- Bye.
- Bye.

181
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,869
- Yeah.
- You sound terrible.

182
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,079
I'm fine, Mom. I just stubbed my toe.

183
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,623
You should get rid of the clutter
in your living room.

184
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,667
- Maybe.
- That room is a hazard.

185
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,879
I've seen the light. Everything goes.
What else you got?

186
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,881
I wanna talk about Rory's dance.

187
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,425
It's just killing me that she's not going.

188
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,012
This may seem frivolous and silly
to her now, but believe me...

189
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,307
these are the kind of experiences
you regret missing later.

190
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,350
Okay.

191
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,144
Regret can make you bitter.
Do you want Rory to be bitter?

192
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,270
Sort of.

193
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,065
- Lorelai!
- She could make some cash off of it.

194
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,442
Become a crazy
Oscar Levant kind of celebrity...

195
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,194
go on talk shows, heckle Regis.

196
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,321
I wish you would take this seriously.

197
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,365
Mom, Rory is going to the dance.

198
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,658
She is?

199
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,454
That's wonderful! I'm thrilled.

200
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,998
I'm making her dress right now.

201
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,751
- You're making her dress?
- Yeah.

202
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,211
But why?

203
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,756
So she'll look really ugly
and people will point and throw rocks.

204
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,549
Why don't you let me buy her a dress?

205
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,094
Mom, you were thrilled
five seconds ago, remember?

206
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,930
- You're not using the curtains, are you?
- I gotta go.

207
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,475
Just one more thing.
Take a picture of Rory for me, please?

208
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,227
- I will.
- On the stairs.

209
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,312
And one by the front door.

210
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,356
And one as she's getting ready...

211
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,316
putting her hair up,
putting her makeup on.

212
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,611
Okay, do you want one
when she's shaving her legs?

213
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,279
You know, one leg up...

214
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,782
in the tub,
waving the disposable razor in the air?

215
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,159
This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

216
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,496
- You get to be there and I don't.
- Oh, boy!

217
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,581
If I got enough pictures, I could at least...

218
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,168
line them up in chronological order
and pretend I was there.

219
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,005
Maybe bind them together,
make a flipbook out of them.

220
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,509
Would you like to come over on Saturday
and see Rory go to the dance?

221
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,679
Why, what a nice idea. I'd love that.

222
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,098
Thank you. I'll see you at 7:00.

223
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,650
- Hi, Tristan.
- Paris.

224
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,653
- Two, I assume?
- You assume right.

225
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,823
- So, who are you taking?
- Why, are you free?

226
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,995
No, what am I thinking? You wouldn't
be free this close to the dance.

227
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,541
Here's your change.

228
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,961
- Is your hair shorter?
- Yeah. Quarter of an inch.

229
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,213
- Really?
- I got it trimmed.

230
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,299
- It looks good.
- Thanks.

231
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,014
- And she's reading again. How novel.
- Goodbye, Tristan.

232
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,851
- Did you get the novel thing? Because...
- I said goodbye.

233
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,229
- What are you doing here?
- I like lines.

234
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,940
- The guy's supposed to buy the tickets.
- Really?

235
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,775
Does Susan Faludi know about this?

236
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,695
- Unless, of course, there is no guy.
- No, there is a guy.

237
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,906
- A cheap guy.
- What can I say? I like them cheap.

238
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,492
Sloppy, too. Bald spot, beer gut...

239
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:09,622
and the pants that slip down in the back,
giving you that good plumber shot.

240
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,957
That sends me through the roof.

241
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,751
So, who is he?

242
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,712
How many languages can you say
'none of your business' in?

243
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,715
- Does he go to this school?
- No, he doesn't.

244
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:25,054
Look, I'll confess something to you.
I don't have a date.

245
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,891
I hear Squeaky Fromme's up for parole
soon. You should keep a good thought.

246
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,893
I actually thought
you'd like to go with me.

247
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,770
- You did not.
- I did, too.

248
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,773
- You did not, because you are not stupid.
- Why, thank you.

249
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,983
Slimy and weaselly, yes. But stupid, no.

250
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,570
You'd have to be stupid to think,
that given our history, I would ever...

251
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:44,406
barring a piano or a safe
falling on my head...

252
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,909
wanna go anywhere with you. Ever.

253
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,578
Okay, fine. I'll take Cissy.

254
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,581
I'll send her a condolence card.

255
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,251
Yeah. At least she won't be
buying her own ticket.

256
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,922
Two, please.

257
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,715
- Idiot.
- Excuse me?

258
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,218
He was totally nice to you
and you were a big jerk.

259
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,512
If you like Tristan so much,
you go out with him.

260
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,639
- I don't have enough change.
- Pay me later.

261
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,767
What am I, your Versateller?
Wait for change.

262
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,602
I need change! Now!

263
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,481
You can't be going
with someone better than Tristan.

264
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,983
- Whatever.
- You probably don't even have a date.

265
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,070
You're probably going to
come down with some rare form of flu...

266
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,280
that only hits losers on dance night.

267
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:29,076
You know what? I don't want my change.
Money makes people shallow.

268
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,454
I've got your change!

269
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,084
If you think I'm keeping this dollar,
I'm not!

270
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,086
- I'll take it.
- Shut up.

271
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,798
- Come on, already!
- I'm primping.

272
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,761
You're 16, you have skin like a baby's ass.
There's nothing to primp.

273
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,555
Okay, here I come.

274
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,935
Someone hit you with a pretty stick.

275
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:57,521
This dress is amazing. You outdid yourself.

276
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,982
It's beautiful, baby. You look beautiful.

277
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:01,316
- Come here.
- What?

278
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,360
- Stray hair.
- Fix, please.

279
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,491
I think my favorite part is the shoes.

280
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,285
- The heels hurt.
- Beauty is pain.

281
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,078
I'll just throw them on on my way out.

282
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:15,831
You should put them on now
and let your feet get numb.

283
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,584
- That's sick.
- Go get me the hair spray.

284
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,712
- It's open!
- It's me!

285
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,381
I got tacos.

286
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,635
I got extra hot sauce
and a couple of extra burritos...

287
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,014
- to put in the fridge for later.
- You take such good care of me.

288
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:33,557
Sookie, look.

289
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,812
Oh, my God! You're a movie star!
I'm serious.

290
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,857
At some point tonight,
walk down a flight of stairs.

291
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,692
Movie stars always walk down staircases.

292
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:46,320
Let me spray while you try to figure out
what she said.

293
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,363
You don't move. I got it.

294
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,660
- Wrong way. I got it.
- Are you okay?

295
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,246
Yeah, sweetie. Hand that to your mother.

296
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,624
My eyelashes are all stuck together.

297
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,918
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

298
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,669
Shield the tacos.

299
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,547
Okay, ready?

300
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,717
God!

301
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:13,305
That'll be good for six slow dances,
four medium ones, one lambada...

302
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:16,058
but if you wanna do any moshing,
I suggest another coat.

303
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,809
No, I think I'm good.

304
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:22,189
Rory, sweetie, is this soap
by the sink in the silver bottle?

305
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,315
No.

306
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,567
Go in there, quick.

307
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,694
We're in here!

308
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,408
'We're in here'?
That's how you answer the door?

309
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,371
- I was all out of Saran wrap.
- I don't want to figure that one out.

310
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,915
- Where is my granddaughter?
- Kitchen.

311
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:43,251
Perfect. I wanna be all ready
for the big entrance.

312
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,379
How's the light in here? Never mind.

313
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,547
I'll take one with the flash
and one without...

314
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,174
to make sure we've got it right.

315
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:50,676
Wow, Mom, look at you.

316
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,929
You'd think Anne Taylor was having
a sale or something.

317
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,431
Okay, Rory, come in here, please.

318
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,185
Hey, Grandma.

319
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:04,731
- She has lived with you too long.
- Lose the bib and the taco...

320
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,735
put your shoes on and come back out.
Let Grandma take the pretty picture.

321
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,991
- I'm gonna get going.
- You are not driving.

322
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,368
I walked.

323
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:20,372
It's nice to see you again, Mrs. Gilmore,
or at least make out your shape.

324
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,916
Call me in 15 minutes,
or I'll send out a search party.

325
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:26,711
You call me if I need to come over
and help you up the stairs.

326
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,131
- No, I'll be fine.
- Bye.

327
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,134
- Why would you need help up the stairs?
- No reason.

328
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,219
Rory, let's go. Your public awaits!

329
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:36,888
- Why aren't you moving?
- I'm comfortable, that's all.

330
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,766
- Are you hurt?
- I have a little back spasm. That's it.

331
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,059
It's no big deal.

332
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,563
- What sort of back spasm?
- I don't know, Mom. Just a normal one.

333
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,690
There is nothing normal
about a back spasm.

334
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:49,818
The fact that it has the word 'spasm' in it
means it's not normal.

335
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,279
- Here she is. Get your camera moving.
- What?

336
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,866
Oh, my! You're gorgeous. Smile.

337
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,745
I'm so glad you decided to buy her a dress.

338
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,039
- That's Dean.
- Come here.

339
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,543
Have an amazing time.

340
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:10,463
I'll chronicle the whole evening for you,
I promise. Bye, Grandma.

341
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,966
- Where are you going?
- To the dance.

342
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,510
You do not go running out the door
when a boy honks.

343
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,430
- Mom, it's fine.
- It certainly is not fine.

344
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:21,224
This is not a drive-through.
She's not fried chicken.

345
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,186
But I told him to honk
and I'd meet him out there. We agreed.

346
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:25,729
I don't care what you told him.

347
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,690
If he wants to take you out,
he will walk up to this door...

348
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,985
knock, and say, 'Good evening,'
and come inside for a moment...

349
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,237
like any civilized human being
would know to do.

350
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,449
- This is silly. I have met him already.
- I haven't.

351
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:41,286
- Yeah, but...
- We will wait until he comes to the door.

352
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:45,040
- He doesn't know he's supposed to.
- He'll figure it out.

353
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,939
- He's not a very bright boy, is he?
- Mom, please.

354
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,445
Don't rush. A lady never rushes.

355
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,493
- Hey.
- Hey.

356
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:24,746
- I thought I was supposed to honk.
- I know. I'm sorry.

357
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,248
Young man, come in here, please.

358
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,799
Hey, Dean. Meet my mother, Emily Post.

359
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,928
- Hi.
- Hello.

360
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,514
Great rap session.
You guys are out of here. Have fun.

361
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:44,933
- Be home by 11:00.
- 12:00.

362
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,936
- Bye, Grandma. Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

363
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:54,275
- What do you know about this boy?
- I know that Rory likes him...

364
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,904
and that his parole officer has high hopes
for his rehabilitation.

365
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,781
- Does he drink?
- Like a fish.

366
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,909
- That's not a crazy question.
- It is a crazy question...

367
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:06,705
because if I knew he was a drinker,
he would not be with Rory now.

368
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,040
- Yes, but...
- Mom, please relax.

369
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,460
Dean is a good kid.
Rory's gonna have a great time.

370
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,670
You got your pictures.

371
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:16,297
Tomorrow I will call you
and give you all the details.

372
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,341
- What are you going to do?
- What do you mean?

373
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,635
- You certainly can't be left alone.
- Yes, I can.

374
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:23,388
You can't move.
You've been sitting there since I arrived.

375
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:25,932
That's because this is a right comfy couch.

376
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:29,018
- Maybe I should stay.
- No, you really don't have to do that.

377
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,646
I'm not leaving my daughter
stranded on the couch.

378
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:34,607
- What if you need to get to the bathroom?
- I don't go anymore.

379
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,984
I gave it up cold turkey.

380
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,944
- I'm staying.
- No, Mom.

381
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:41,656
Look, I can stand, okay?

382
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:44,826
See?

383
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:49,289
I'm up. Okay, see? I'm fine.

384
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:51,875
- Move.
- What?

385
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,378
Move. If you're fine, then move.

386
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:57,380
I can move.

387
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:01,092
This is me moving.

388
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:04,596
Any second now, the moving will begin.

389
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,055
Rats.

390
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:08,516
I'll go start some tea.

391
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,811
Please tell me
you have something besides Lipton.

392
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,356
A stroke would be so good
right about now.

393
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,324
Maybe we should just forget about this.

394
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,533
Okay.

395
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,369
I mean, it's just a dance.
What's the big deal?

396
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:29,537
Beats me.

397
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,123
And these kids at my school... Awful.

398
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:34,709
- Have you seen The Outsiders?
- Yeah, I have.

399
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,586
Just call me Ponyboy.

400
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:41,090
I heard this place is beautiful, though.
Old and historic.

401
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:44,219
Maybe we could just go in for a minute.

402
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,720
- Fine.
- Or not.

403
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,180
Fine, too.

404
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:49,974
I don't know. Why can't I decide?

405
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,769
This is stupid. What do you think?

406
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,813
I think that you look amazing tonight.

407
00:21:58,107 --> 00:22:00,777
Maybe just a couple of minutes won't hurt.

408
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,030
Yes, Marta.

409
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:07,533
Just make sure everything's locked up
before you leave.

410
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,078
No, I won't be home tonight.

411
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,623
- Was that a pain?
- Yes, a big one.

412
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,585
All right, that's it. Bye.

413
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:21,422
So, Mom, you really don't have to do this.

414
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,593
Don't be silly. I couldn't possibly
leave you alone like this.

415
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,095
What are you doing, Mom?

416
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:29,597
I'm trying to find the candlesticks
I bought you.

417
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,307
What candlesticks?

418
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:35,186
The Baccarat candlesticks
I bought you last year for Christmas.

419
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:38,731
I assume that you stuffed them
in the back of the closet somewhere.

420
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,567
No, I did not stuff them
in the back of the closet.

421
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,278
Then where are they? I don't see them out.

422
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,823
See, we didn't actually...

423
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:50,326
have a big use for the crystal candlesticks.

424
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,994
So I kind of...

425
00:22:54,747 --> 00:22:56,249
exchanged them.

426
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:58,459
- For what?
- A monkey lamp.

427
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:02,130
- Pardon me?
- It's a lamp with a bunch of monkeys on it.

428
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:05,258
Baccarat crystal candlesticks
for a monkey lamp?

429
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:07,552
They're really happy monkeys, Mom.

430
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:09,595
Where is this lamp? I want to see it.

431
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,889
It's right there on the desk.

432
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:17,979
Oh, my God!
They're holding coconuts and leering.

433
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:19,188
It's funny.

434
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,648
You traded my lovely gift...

435
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,485
for a semi-pornographic,
leering monkey lamp? How could you?

436
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,238
This is not just about returning a gift.

437
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:29,741
This goes to the very heart
of the question of taste.

438
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:33,661
You were given something of substance,
and you cast it off for a ridiculous...

439
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,330
slightly sinister barroom decoration?

440
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,875
Explain this to me, Lorelai.

441
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:41,294
My back hurts.

442
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,646
- It's a very good room.
- Looks historical.

443
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,232
I commend the person
who suggested this location.

444
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,527
So, we could just get our picture taken
and leave.

445
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:07,862
We could.

446
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:11,282
- Or we could dance a little first.
- Yeah?

447
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:13,701
- I stress 'a little. '
- Something slow.

448
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:15,411
That sounds good.

449
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,665
- Can we go yet?
- We haven't even eaten dinner.

450
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,084
- I'm bored.
- We have to wait for Paris anyway.

451
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:24,170
Fine. Give me your roll.

452
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:28,799
- What?
- Rory Gilmore.

453
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:30,593
God, she's got good hair.

454
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:32,428
- Who's the dish?
- Beats me.

455
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:35,223
He's not from the manor born,
that's for sure.

456
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:36,515
Let's go.

457
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,396
So, should we dance
or should we sit first?

458
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:44,190
Rory, you came.

459
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:46,067
Great dress. Who's it by?

460
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,402
- Lorelai Gilmore.
- You made it yourself?

461
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:50,821
- No, my mom made it for me.
- She did, really?

462
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:53,658
So, you're traveling
with a bodyguard now?

463
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:56,577
No, this is my... This is Dean.

464
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:59,413
- Dean, this is Louise and Madeline.
- Hi.

465
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,750
- My mom can't make anything.
- How tall are you?

466
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:06,712
- Soup, she can make soup.
- You know, my whole family is really tall.

467
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,216
I mean, the men mostly.
What are you, 6'1", 6'2"?

468
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,385
Does he get a prize if he guesses?

469
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:15,263
One kind of soup, actually.
It's green, lumpy.

470
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:18,099
- I'm 6'2".
- Actually, she can't make soup either.

471
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:20,393
- 6'2" is a good height.
- You think?

472
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:21,686
I think.

473
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:26,399
What do you think? Too tall?

474
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:27,692
- Not in heels.
- Good.

475
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:30,152
Although, the saddle shoes
make it kind of difficult.

476
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:32,446
- I'll just have to stoop then.
- I guess so.

477
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,240
Okay, I'm bored.

478
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,953
- I like your dress.
- Thanks.

479
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,041
Hey, you're nice.

480
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,295
- Slow song.
- Let's go.

481
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,595
- I see you came.
- You sold me the ticket.

482
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:58,014
I'm Jacob.

483
00:25:58,097 --> 00:26:00,433
- Hi, I'm Rory. This is Dean.
- Hi.

484
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:02,560
Excuse us.

485
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,396
Those are not friends.

486
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:07,940
- I was being polite.
- Well, don't.

487
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:12,361
- So, that's Paris?
- Yes, it is.

488
00:26:12,653 --> 00:26:15,114
- She seems fun.
- Yeah, she is.

489
00:26:15,197 --> 00:26:18,993
Okay, this dancing thing is not something
I want you to get used to...

490
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:20,244
or comment on.

491
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:22,288
Now, that goes both ways.

492
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:30,296
If I kiss you, is a nun gonna come out
and boot me out of here?

493
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:32,006
It's not a Catholic school.

494
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:34,925
- So I can kiss you?
- Yeah, you can kiss me.

495
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,688
- Okay, I'm perfect now.
- Great.

496
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:49,690
- You want to dance?
- Nope.

497
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,567
- You want to eat?
- Nope.

498
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,611
You want to go make out?

499
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,822
Yeah, all right, let's go.

500
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,329
So, Ponyboy, you happy?

501
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:05,748
Yeah, I'm happy.

502
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,961
There you go.

503
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:13,339
Mom, I think somebody already ate that.

504
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:15,591
- That is a mashed banana on toast.
- Okay.

505
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:18,385
I used to make this for you
when you were a little girl.

506
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:21,055
- You did?
- Whenever you got sick, I made this.

507
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:22,765
Wasn't it the other way around?

508
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:25,100
- You don't want it?
- No, I want it.

509
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:27,561
- I'll just take it back.
- Mom, I said I want it.

510
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:29,855
Are you sure?
Because I could throw it away.

511
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,149
Relinquish the banana, please.

512
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:36,862
You can't possibly be comfortable
like that.

513
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,532
Mother, please,
this is the first position in 24 hours...

514
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:42,284
- that has not made me crazy.
- All right.

515
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:45,079
You're not eating.

516
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:53,545
- Mom, please don't make me eat this.
- You have to eat something.

517
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:56,090
Sookie left me a burrito in the fridge.

518
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:59,093
- I'll go warm it up for you.
- I can eat it cold.

519
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,221
Fine, I'll just go get it then.

520
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,306
Hot's better, though.

521
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:06,517
I'll be right back.

522
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,033
Okay, I need something to drink.
You want some punch?

523
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:24,201
Sure.

524
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,747
- Hi. Rory, right?
- Yes.

525
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,876
- Jacob. We met earlier with Paris.
- Yes, I remember.

526
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:36,588
- Are you having a good time?
- Actually, I am. You?

527
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:38,465
It's okay.

528
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:41,969
So, was that your boyfriend?

529
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:45,931
- I don't know. I'm not sure.
- You're not sure?

530
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,142
We've only been going out
for a little while...

531
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,477
So there's still a little room to play?

532
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,980
- What?
- Would you like to dance?

533
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:54,982
No, thanks.

534
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:57,067
Maybe I could get your number?

535
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:59,278
- What for?
- To call you.

536
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:03,032
I'm sorry, aren't you here with Paris?

537
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:08,746
So maybe you shouldn't be over here
asking me for my number then.

538
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:11,498
Why? Paris is my cousin.

539
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,834
- Your cousin?
- Yeah.

540
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,671
- Paris is your cousin? You're related?
- Yeah.

541
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:22,926
Jacob, it's been very nice to meet you.
I hope you have a lovely evening.

542
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:28,182
Look, Barbara Stanwyck.

543
00:29:28,265 --> 00:29:31,602
- I just love Barbara Stanwyck.
- Yeah, she's good.

544
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:35,147
She had that wonderful voice,
that husky, deep voice.

545
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,107
I just love that voice.

546
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:42,154
You know, Mom, you have
kind of a Barbara Stanwycky voice.

547
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:44,406
- I do not.
- I mean it.

548
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:48,702
You could've gotten Fred MacMurray
to off Dad if you'd really wanted to.

549
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,288
You do enjoy teasing me, don't you?

550
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:53,373
You know, I really do.

551
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:57,836
- Rory looked so lovely tonight.
- She did, didn't she?

552
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,715
I can't get over how she's grown into
that little woman who walked out of here.

553
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:02,925
I know.

554
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:06,011
You know what, Mom?

555
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,597
I made the dress.

556
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:12,768
- You did a lovely job.
- Thank you.

557
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:16,021
With Rory and the dress.

558
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:18,398
Thank you.

559
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:24,905
Let me get this out of your way.

560
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:27,574
You really don't remember me
making this for you?

561
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:30,869
- I don't, I'm sorry.
- I did, and you loved it.

562
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:34,998
- You know what? Let me give it a try.
- All right.

563
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:44,716
Yes?

564
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:47,886
It's even more disgusting
than I thought it was gonna be.

565
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,263
It is not.

566
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:57,646
Oh, my God, it's horrible!
What on earth was I thinking?

567
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,734
So, you wanna maybe go?

568
00:31:03,026 --> 00:31:05,404
You're bored? I'm sorry.
Let's go, right away.

569
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:08,365
I'm not bored.
I thought there's still a little time left.

570
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:11,201
Maybe we could
get a cup of coffee somewhere...

571
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:14,246
hang out a little, take a walk.
You know, just us.

572
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:15,789
That'd be nice.

573
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:18,292
No, you stay. I'll get the coats.

574
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:22,087
So how many people have you told?

575
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,215
- Four? Five? Everybody?
- What are you talking about?

576
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:26,925
You know that Jacob is my cousin.

577
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:30,554
Now you have all the ammunition
you needed to pay me back, right?

578
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:32,597
I don't wanna pay you back,
I wanna get away.

579
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:35,017
Now you can go all over school
telling everyone...

580
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,478
that Paris Geller couldn't get a date
to the dance. That she had no one.

581
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:42,107
Since she couldn't just not come,
she had to ask her cousin to take her.

582
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,401
She had to give him gas money
to make him do it.

583
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:46,236
Go ahead, tell them!

584
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:48,780
I don't have to. You just did.

585
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:04,504
- We haven't met.
- No, we haven't.

586
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:07,090
- I'm Tristan.
- Yes, we have.

587
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,676
- What are you talking about?
- Rory's mentioned you.

588
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,846
- Yeah?
- I wouldn't get quite so excited about it.

589
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,932
- Why, did she say something mean?
- She said you're a jackass.

590
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,642
- Really?
- Actually, no.

591
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:20,479
Rory doesn't use words like that.
I embellished a little.

592
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:22,731
So you're the big, strong protector?

593
00:32:22,814 --> 00:32:24,775
Little princess needs a protector.

594
00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:26,401
- What's your problem, man?
- Nothing.

595
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:28,487
- I just don't like your girlfriend.
- Really?

596
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,199
- It doesn't look that way to me.
- I don't care how it looks to you.

597
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,202
You got in my path,
not the other way around.

598
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:38,163
- You're kidding, right?
- Why, are you going somewhere?

599
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:40,957
- Get out of my way, Dristan.
- Aren't you clever?

600
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,709
What's going on?

601
00:32:42,751 --> 00:32:45,003
Nothing. Just getting to know
your boyfriend.

602
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,339
- It's going real well, don't you think?
- Yeah.

603
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:49,466
We're just about to build a clubhouse.

604
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:52,094
I hate to break up the party,
but we should go.

605
00:32:52,177 --> 00:32:54,679
- Why? Little girl's got to be home?
- Stop!

606
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,973
No, I think you two
make a very cute couple.

607
00:32:57,057 --> 00:33:00,936
Is your horse and buggy parked outside?
Gotta get home for the barn raising?

608
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,270
Let's go.

609
00:33:03,438 --> 00:33:06,900
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- You will not push me again!

610
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:10,570
Are you seriously trying to act tough?
You're wearing a tie, for God's sake!

611
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:11,863
Outside, now.

612
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:16,618
No, it'd be like fighting an accountant.
I'll call you when I need my taxes done.

613
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,249
- You don't want to fight me, Tristan!
- Why not?

614
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:24,459
'Cause I'll kill you, idiot!

615
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:27,128
Come on, Rory.

616
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:32,926
You will not come near her ever again.

617
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:39,766
- That was good.
- Whatever.

618
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:43,186
Are you okay?

619
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:48,275
Did you really bring your cousin?

620
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,086
- What are you doing?
- Go to sleep.

621
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:11,423
- The movie's not over.
- I'll tell you how it ends.

622
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:30,025
Thank you, Mommy.

623
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,827
That was quite a dance.

624
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:43,121
I seriously don't know what got into him.

625
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:44,581
- I do.
- What?

626
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:46,458
He has a thing for you.

627
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:49,336
No, he doesn't.
It's just a game to him or something.

628
00:34:49,377 --> 00:34:51,087
He has a thing for you.

629
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:54,466
He does nothing but insult me
and make me miserable.

630
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:56,509
He has a thing for you.

631
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:00,513
I don't know how I feel
about this whole situation.

632
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:02,515
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

633
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,019
Having my boyfriend defend my honor.
It's weird.

634
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:08,021
Boyfriend?

635
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:10,231
- What?
- You said 'boyfriend. '

636
00:35:10,648 --> 00:35:12,734
No, I just meant boyfriend...

637
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:16,196
in the sense that the defending-me thing
was very boyfriendy...

638
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,239
but only in the broadest sense
of the word...

639
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:20,909
which doesn't even apply at all here.

640
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:23,286
You are seriously babbling.

641
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,289
- I didn't mean that you were my boyfriend.
- Okay.

642
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:29,667
- I don't think you're my boyfriend.
- Okay.

643
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,049
- What?
- Are you my boyfriend?

644
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:39,385
In the 'broadest sense of the word' way?

645
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:41,054
No, in the real...

646
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:44,057
'Hi, this is Dean, my boyfriend,'
kind of way.

647
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,518
Well, I am if you want me to be.

648
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:48,061
I do.

649
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:51,064
Okay.

650
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:52,690
- So it's settled.
- Yes, it is.

651
00:35:52,774 --> 00:35:55,485
- You're my boyfriend.
- That's the consensus.

652
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:02,492
I'm feeling pretty good about this decision.

653
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:04,828
Well, I'm very glad to hear it.

654
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:08,373
I guess Miss Patty forgot to lock up.

655
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:11,126
I've never really seen in here before.

656
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,838
- Are all these women really Miss Patty?
- Yeah.

657
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,174
She said she's done everything
in show business...

658
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:21,010
except set fire to the hoop
the dog jumps through.

659
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:22,470
I'll get it.

660
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:27,892
God, this weighs a ton.
What do you have in here?

661
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:29,060
I don't know.

662
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:32,730
A lipstick, $5 bill, gum, hair spray, a book.

663
00:36:33,189 --> 00:36:34,732
- A book?
- Yeah.

664
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:36,609
- You brought a book to the dance?
- Yeah.

665
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,112
You thought there'd be a lot of downtime?

666
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:42,907
No. I just take a book with me everywhere.
It's just habit.

667
00:36:43,658 --> 00:36:46,953
- So, what are you reading?
- The Portable Dorothy Parker.

668
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:55,169
'There's little in taking or giving
There's little in water or wine

669
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:59,424
'This living, this living, this living
Was never a project of mine'

670
00:37:03,303 --> 00:37:05,221
- Cheery.
- Funny, though.

671
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:08,433
- Hey.
- What?

672
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:12,562
- Thank you for tonight. It was perfect.
- You're welcome.

673
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:41,507
Okay, ladies, grab your yoga mats.

674
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:49,057
Oh, my goodness, it's Lorelai's girl!

675
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:52,477
- Patty, Rory Gilmore is here.
- What?

676
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,897
She's over here,
asleep with the bag boy from the market.

677
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,857
What are we supposed to do?

678
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,568
Rory, honey, it's Miss Patty.

679
00:38:01,986 --> 00:38:05,239
Rory? What are you doing here?

680
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:06,866
Miss Patty?

681
00:38:06,908 --> 00:38:08,993
Yes. Have you been here all night?

682
00:38:09,077 --> 00:38:11,287
Oh, no. Dean, wake up.

683
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:14,207
- What time is it?
- It's 5:30 in the morning.

684
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,502
Oh, my God, we fell asleep.
How could we have fallen asleep?

685
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:19,712
Calm down, I'll explain it to your mom.

686
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:22,340
- Where's my purse?
- I got it. Relax.

687
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:24,133
I have to go.

688
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:29,555
- Wait up!
- I have to go!

689
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:31,849
I'm going with you.
We'll explain. It'll be okay.

690
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:34,685
You can't come.
You shouldn't be near my house right now.

691
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:37,397
- It's not our fault.
- I know. I just have to get home.

692
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,482
- Please let me come with you.
- No!

693
00:38:39,732 --> 00:38:41,401
I have to go home.

694
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:50,952
- Lorelai, get up. Right now!
- What?

695
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:52,620
Rory's not home.

696
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:54,872
Rory's what?

697
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:57,041
I sat all night. I dozed off for one second.

698
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:00,086
The next thing I know,
it's 5:30 and she's not here.

699
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:05,091
She's not there. Aren't you listening?

700
00:39:08,636 --> 00:39:10,930
Where's the phone? Call the police.

701
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,642
What are you doing? Call the police!

702
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:16,519
- Mom, stop it!
- What are you doing?

703
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:18,521
I'm looking for the phone!

704
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:20,481
Why don't you ever clean up around here?

705
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:23,693
You can't find the phone
in an emergency. What if there was a fire?

706
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:25,361
What if Rory was choking?

707
00:39:25,444 --> 00:39:27,864
- Mom, stop yelling.
- Rory is missing!

708
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:31,075
I know that,
and your yelling is not helping me.

709
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:44,922
What?

710
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,926
Okay.

711
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:52,096
Thanks.

712
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:56,392
No, thank you so much. Okay, bye-bye.

713
00:39:57,852 --> 00:40:00,104
- Rory's okay.
- Where is she? What happened?

714
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:02,607
She and Dean were at Miss Patty's.

715
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:05,568
What is that, a motel?

716
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:10,197
It's a dance studio. That was Patty.
She said that she found them asleep...

717
00:40:10,281 --> 00:40:12,491
and woke them up,
and Rory's on her way home.

718
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:15,453
- And what state were they found in?
- She didn't say, okay?

719
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:17,705
Let's be calm
until we know what happened.

720
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:20,166
What do you mean?
We know what happened.

721
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,835
- No, we don't.
- They were out all night!

722
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:25,004
I'm gonna make some coffee.

723
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:29,175
Lorelai, I've watched you
do a lot of stupid things in your life...

724
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,761
- and I have held my tongue.
- You've what?

725
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:35,681
But I will not stand by
and let you allow that girl to ruin her life.

726
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:38,142
Back off.

727
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:40,019
She spent the night out with that boy...

728
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:42,146
the one you let her
run off to that dance with.

729
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:44,607
So help me God,
I will not get into this with you.

730
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,984
- She's doing the same thing you did.
- No, she's not.

731
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:49,070
- She'll get pregnant.
- No, she's not.

732
00:40:49,153 --> 00:40:51,322
She's gonna ruin everything,
just like you did.

733
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:54,367
No, she's not!

734
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,161
Rory is a good kid, Mom! She's not me!

735
00:40:57,203 --> 00:40:59,330
What kind of mother are you to allow this?

736
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:01,832
I don't know.
What kind of mother were you?

737
00:41:01,874 --> 00:41:04,794
You're gonna lose her just like I lost you.

738
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:06,837
I am not gonna lose her. Do you hear me?

739
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:09,674
Even if I hadn't gotten pregnant,
you'd still have lost me.

740
00:41:09,757 --> 00:41:12,968
I had nothing in that house.
I had no life, no air.

741
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:16,222
You strangled me. I do not strangle Rory.

742
00:41:16,263 --> 00:41:19,225
You're so perfect, and I was so horrible.

743
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:23,020
I put you in good schools.
I gave you the best of everything.

744
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:25,189
I made sure
you had the finest opportunities.

745
00:41:25,231 --> 00:41:27,066
And I am so tired of hearing about...

746
00:41:27,149 --> 00:41:30,069
how you were suffocated
and I was so controlling.

747
00:41:30,152 --> 00:41:31,654
If I was so controlling...

748
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:35,157
why couldn't I control you getting
pregnant and throwing your life away?

749
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:36,742
- Get out.
- What?

750
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:40,830
You will not come into my house
and tell me I threw my life away.

751
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:42,832
Look around, Mom. This is a life.

752
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:45,626
It has a little color,
so it may look unfamiliar to you.

753
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:47,002
But it's a life.

754
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:49,547
If I hadn't gotten pregnant,
I wouldn't have Rory.

755
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,965
That's not what I meant.

756
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:54,427
Maybe I was some horrible,
uncontrollable child like you say...

757
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,845
but Rory isn't.

758
00:41:55,928 --> 00:41:59,348
She's smart and careful, and I trust her.
She's gonna be fine.

759
00:41:59,432 --> 00:42:03,811
If you can't accept or believe that,
then I don't want you in this house!

760
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:20,953
Mom, thank you for saying all those...

761
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:24,331
What were you thinking,
staying out all night? Are you insane?

762
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:26,542
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

763
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,962
You're talking to the queen of staying out.
I invented the concept.

764
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:32,631
This is no accident!
You can't do this. Period!

765
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:33,799
Nothing happened.

766
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:37,428
Do you have any idea what it's like
to wake up with my mother here...

767
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,555
and find out that you never came home?

768
00:42:39,638 --> 00:42:41,473
So all this is about Grandma being here?

769
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:43,726
No, it's about
the feeling of complete terror...

770
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:46,103
- when you're not in bed in the morning.
- Sorry.

771
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:48,522
It's a different kind of terror
when I find out...

772
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:52,651
- that you spent the night with some guy!
- I didn't spend the night. We fell asleep.

773
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:55,529
You are going on the pill.
You are not getting pregnant!

774
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:57,364
I'm not sleeping with Dean!

775
00:42:57,448 --> 00:42:59,825
What happened to all that stuff
you said to Grandma?

776
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:01,660
What happened to trusting me?

777
00:43:01,702 --> 00:43:05,164
- Where did all that go?
- It's back on Patty's yoga mats.

778
00:43:05,205 --> 00:43:06,707
This is crap!

779
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:10,169
You know I didn't do anything.
You know this was an accident.

780
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,004
You're just mad because I screwed up...

781
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:14,882
and I did it in front of Grandma,
and she nailed you for it.

782
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:18,969
I'm sorry that I screwed up,
and I'm sorry that you got yelled at...

783
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:21,889
but I didn't do anything, and you know it!
