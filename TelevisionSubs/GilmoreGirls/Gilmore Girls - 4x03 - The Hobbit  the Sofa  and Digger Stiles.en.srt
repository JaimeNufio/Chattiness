1
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:07,285
Hey, you know what's great about you going off to college?

2
00:00:07,368 --> 00:00:08,515
My newfound independence?

3
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:11,869
Oh, no. My new batch of youth-oriented catalogs.

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:15,933
For example, where on Earth could I put this fabulous purple flowered rug?

5
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:19,184
It's so young and cool but doesn't really go with my room, so...

6
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:20,122
My room.

7
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:24,125
The matching beanbag chair arrives next week.

8
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:27,007
- I love it when you miss me. 
- Oh, it's not that I miss you.

9
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:30,270
It's just since you've been gone, I finally realized how the living room stayed so clean.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,351
- What do you think? 
- It works.

11
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:34,800
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

12
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:37,382
So, Sookie sent marshmallow cookies,

13
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,813
Luke sent muffins,

14
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:43,356
and I got you a copy of the Stars Hollow Gazette.

15
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:45,394
You don't have to bring that to me anymore. I subscribed.

16
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:47,950
You subscribed to the Stars Hollow Gazette?

17
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,487
The editor of the Stars Hollow Gazette does not subscribe to the Stars Hollow Gazette.

18
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:53,094
I didn't want to get cut off from the town.

19
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:54,473
That's very sweet of you.

20
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:56,607
Hey, you wanna grab some coffee before I head back?

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,698
- Can't. 
- Why?

22
00:00:57,912 --> 00:00:59,572
- It's shopping week. 
- Isn't it always?

23
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:01,363
The first week of school is called shopping week.

24
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:03,846
You get to try out as many classes as you want before you pick

25
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,495
the ones you want to stick with for the semester.

26
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:08,209
I picked over fifty classes I'm gonna try out,

27
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:10,488
plus another ten I'm gonna squeeze in if I have the time.

28
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,326
They all sound completely amazing. I stayed up all night

29
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:15,336
reading the class subscriptions over and over.

30
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:17,446
You do know that if you weren't so pretty,

31
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,831
you would've gotten the crap kicked out of you every day of your life.

32
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:20,722
Walk me out?

33
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:22,120
Because you need the protection.

34
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,218
- Hey, what time's your first class? 
- Oh, you know, soon.

35
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:27,542
What?

36
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,670
You're not gonna rush to your first class and get there like an hour early, are you?

37
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:31,639
No.

38
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:33,601
- You are. 
- I am not.

39
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:36,731
When you started elementary school, you told me the teacher wanted to meet

40
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:40,757
all the parents at 6:30, and when we got there, the school wasn't open yet.

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,761
I did that once.

42
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:44,224
No, you got away with it once. You tried it every year.

43
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:45,304
I'm not gonna be early.

44
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:47,623
You know, if you took all the time you wasted being early for things...

45
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:50,102
What?

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,592
My mother was here.

47
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:52,816
What?

48
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,797
My mother - she was here. I can feel it.

49
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:55,979
Grandma hasn't been here.

50
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:58,007
- Smell that? 
- Smell what?

51
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:01,042
The room - it smells like guilt and Chanel No. 5.

52
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,502
Mom, I'm telling you, you're wrong.

53
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,730
- You put the coffee table like that? 
- No.

54
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,761
I have three other roommates. One of them probably did it.

55
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:08,852
Three roommates?

56
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,484
- When'd the other one come? 
- Last night. Her name's Janet.

57
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:12,190
What's she like?

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,860
- She jogs. 
- Enough said.

59
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,717
- Come on, let's go. 
- You seriously don't smell that?

60
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,144
We can get one cup of coffee, and then I have to get to class.

61
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:19,947
- I knew you were early. 
- I'm not that early.

62
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:33,520
Freshmen.

63
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:36,518
- Sign and date. 
- Signing and dating.

64
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:38,499
Oh, do you have your last check stub?

65
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,894
Yeah. Here. Oh, remember that?

66
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,057
- Income. 
- Yeah.

67
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,920
Those were the days, huh? Okay, my hand is cramping, and I'm done signing now.

68
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:49,852
Sookie, can you hand me that screwdriver?

69
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:53,128
Oh, hey, tomorrow we have to meet with Ted Oldaman

70
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:56,313
and get our liability insurance instated before we can break ground on the inn.

71
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,161
And that reminds me...

72
00:04:58,427 --> 00:05:00,860
Tom sent over the initial proposal for the work.

73
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,354
- How much? 
- I'll tell you later.

74
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:03,988
- When? 
- After you blow.

75
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:04,714
Come on.

76
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,742
Once you have the baby, then you can have the cow.

77
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:08,216
Okay, I think I got it.

78
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:09,538
Is it really that much?

79
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:10,993
Here. I'm going to the nursery.

80
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:14,638
It's $20,000 more than we thought.

81
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,773
$20,000? That sucks.

82
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:19,286
- I got the chimney report back. 
- Oh, shoot.

83
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:21,279
- Hello? Hello? 
- What is that?

84
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:26,045
Jackson. He's trying to hook up the house's central sound system to the baby monitor.

85
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,182
I am in the baby's room. I repeat, I am in the baby's room. Copy that.

86
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,085
This is probably the cutest creepy thing he's done yet.

87
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:35,901
Can anyone hear me? I repeat, can anyone hear me?

88
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,164
- Yes, Jackson! 
- You're supposed to use the walkie-talkie.

89
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:41,953
Roger, roger, Jackson. We're receiving some feedback.

90
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,735
I repeat, we're receiving some feed-

91
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,241
Hello? Sookie?

92
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:49,597
- Jackson, I'm receiving feed... 
- Do you hear me? Sookie?

93
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,393
Yes, I can hear you. I...

94
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,948
Sookie, just tell me if you can hear me.

95
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,929
Jackson, I can hear...

96
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,721
I can hear you just fine!

97
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,644
Oh yeah, this system's gonna work great.

98
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:02,930
Why aren't you using the walkie-talkie?

99
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,772
- It's not working. 
- Here.

100
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,904
- Hey, you know, I had a thought. 
- Yes?

101
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,595
Well, obviously,

102
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,094
it's gonna take some time to get the inn up and running, right?

103
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,836
Right.

104
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:20,717
And until we do, we have absolutely no money coming in whatsoever.

105
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:21,726
So it's a happy thought.

106
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,492
What do you think about starting a catering company?

107
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:25,566
- A catering company. 
- Yeah.

108
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:28,695
You could plan the events, decorations, themes, and I can cook.

109
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:31,194
And it wouldn't be for very long - just until the baby came.

110
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,117
- Yes, but... 
- Okay, here.

111
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:37,009
Sookie, I'm not really a party planner. I've never done that.

112
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,869
What are you talking about? You put on all those beautiful weddings at the inn.

113
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:44,274
And the conventions -- the men in the hats and the buttons.

114
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:47,233
Yes, but I had a staff at the inn and I had resources.

115
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:48,612
Oh, come on.

116
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,536
It'll be so fun to work together again.

117
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:54,018
- Just think about it. 
- Fine, I'll think about it.

118
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:54,638
Good.

119
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,797
How long do I have to think about it?

120
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,005
- About a week. 
- Sookie.

121
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,684
Helen Thompson's son, Aaron, is having a birthday party

122
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,532
and she asked me to cater, and I suggested that you plan it.

123
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,141
She thought it was a fabulous idea.

124
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:11,012
So she offered us the job and I just took it. It's Thursday.

125
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:15,711
She wanted to do it on Aaron's actual birthday and I thought that was so sweet.

126
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,245
- Helen's like that, you know? 
- Yes, I know.

127
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:21,145
I can call her right now and tell her no if that's what you want.

128
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,457
I mean it, you say the word and it's off.

129
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:27,247
Maybe we could just try this one just to see if you like it.

130
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:28,511
Maybe.

131
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:32,392
Okay, Sookie, can you hear me now? Hello?

132
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:35,756
- Jackson, I can hear you. 
- Use the monitor!

133
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:36,754
Sorry!

134
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,257
- Russian economics sucks. 
- I will make a note.

135
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,504
Tanna?

136
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:01,111
- Tanna? 
- What?

137
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,924
- Where did this come from? 
- What?

138
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:05,964
This - the furniture, the couch, the chairs, the rug.

139
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,822
I don't know. It must've been here when I got back.

140
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:12,953
Hello?

141
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:16,624
I was going to wait until you called me, but my life isn't as long as yours.

142
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,611
- Did you sit on the couch? 
- The couch?

143
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,637
I didn't want to get it too soft because I knew you would be studying there

144
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,632
as well as watching television, and you would need a little bit of support.

145
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,967
- You did this? 
- Of course I did it.

146
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,984
My granddaughter's a Yalie now. She needs to live like a Yalie.

147
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,158
But how? When?

148
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:34,529
I snuck in yesterday when you were in classes

149
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:36,920
just to measure to make sure everything would fit.

150
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:40,990
Then I had to butter up your dippy freshman counselor so she'd let the movers in.

151
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:43,238
Did you look in the entertainment center yet?

152
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:44,140
No.

153
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:50,216
That's a plasma TV with a VCR and a DVD player.

154
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,412
There's also a five-CD changer and a turntable,

155
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:56,924
and the whole thing is wired in 5.1 surround sound.

156
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:59,034
Now I have no idea what that means,

157
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:01,425
but the man who installed it said to get

158
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:04,077
Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.

159
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,751
It's supposed to be amazing.

160
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:10,226
Grandma, this is all really sweet, but I have roommates, you know?

161
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,151
And this might make them a little uncomfortable.

162
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,359
Uncomfortable about what?

163
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:17,993
Well, this is a common room. It is common to all of us.

164
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:22,029
Four of us who live here. There are four of us who live here together.

165
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:24,727
And the common room... it's what we all have in common.

166
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,100
Oh, just show them how to use the remote. I'm sure they'll be fine with everything.

167
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,989
Grandma, I worry that by you giving me all these things,

168
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:32,805
it kind of makes it my room.

169
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:34,331
- Exactly. 
- What?

170
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:37,460
Never underestimate the value of the upper hand, Rory.

171
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:39,328
You are in the real world now.

172
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,387
- Status matters. 
- But...

173
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:43,696
Your grandfather and I are very proud of you.

174
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:46,210
Enjoy the furniture. We'll see you on Friday.

175
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:48,146
Okay, see you Friday.

176
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:53,368
My grandmother broke into our room and furnished it.

177
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,641
Did she put that fireplace in, too?

178
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,782
No, Tanna, the fireplace was always...

179
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:01,596
Hey, why don't we take a little tour of the place, okay?

180
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,322
- Great. 
- Yeah.

181
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:29,018
They burnt my fries, forgot to give me an extra side of barbecue sauce,

182
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,739
the jeep is making that crunchy sound again,

183
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,942
and I have to spend my evening making elf ears

184
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:34,711
for Aaron Thompson's Lord of the Rings party.

185
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:38,081
Grandma broke into my dorm and redid the entire common room

186
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:41,168
in $25,000 worth of furniture and stereo equipment.

187
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,715
- You win. 
- It's unbelievable.

188
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,142
You should see this place. I feel like I'm at Uday's house.

189
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:46,822
Okay, tell me the whole story.

190
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,250
I came home and all the normal furniture was gone

191
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,925
and all this stuff was in here.

192
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:53,279
What did your roommates say?

193
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,473
Tanna still doesn't know she's at Yale, Paris saw it and said nothing.

194
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,782
Oh, so that's coming.

195
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,590
Janet's out jogging so I don't know what she thinks,

196
00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:02,836
but I have to hope she's pleased 'cause that girl's in shape and can kick my butt.

197
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:05,780
Well, just make sure there's something she likes on the TV when she gets home.

198
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:09,181
Something soothing to runners - maybe something that goes in a circle over and over.

199
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,704
This is bad. This is a total invasion of privacy.

200
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:13,404
- I know. 
- She didn't even ask.

201
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:15,391
She got rid of everything that was in here.

202
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,844
What if some of that furniture belonged to someone and they wanted it?

203
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:18,994
I don't know what she was thinking.

204
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,635
She was thinking, "Rory's life - mine. Must cover with chenille."

205
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,144
- I can't believe she did this. 
- Oh, yes, you can.

206
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:27,321
- Excuse me? 
- Rory, come on, it's my mother.

207
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:29,538
It's Emily Gilmore. This is what she does.

208
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,929
You've seen her pull stunts like this on me for years.

209
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,142
Yeah, but that was you.

210
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,595
 I told you when you borrowed that money from her that this is what you were getting into.

211
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:36,936
I can't believe you're gloating.

212
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:39,372
I'm not gloating. I'm just saying, when you sleep with dogs,

213
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:41,262
you wake up with an entertainment center.

214
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,630
Fine, so what do I do?

215
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,670
Well, you could come out and say, "Grandma, this furniture is very nice.

216
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,805
I appreciate the gesture, but this is a dorm room,

217
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:51,845
and I cannot guarantee that the other people will love it as much as I do,

218
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:54,006
and I worry about expensive equipment getting stolen,

219
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:55,813
and it's just maybe too much right now."

220
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:57,293
- That sounds good. 
- Okay.

221
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:59,869
And then my mother will say, "Rory, your grandfather and I

222
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:01,522
are paying for you to go to Yale.

223
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,117
We are enabling you to have this rarefied education,

224
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,708
and you're being ungrateful and small-minded, and I resent it.

225
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:09,203
I am hurt on a level you will not be able to understand

226
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:12,347
until you yourself have a daughter or a granddaughter

227
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:15,762
who will cut your heart out the way you've just cut mine out,

228
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:18,044
and I hope that small veneer of independence

229
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:20,533
that you've extracted from this incident is worth the complete

230
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,216
and total alienation of the grandparents who have done nothing

231
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:25,725
but love you and thought of you only."

232
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,271
Or I could keep the furniture.

233
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:28,342
Yes, you could.

234
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:29,601
This is great.

235
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:33,676
Hon, seriously, if you feel strongly, say something.

236
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:36,400
I just want you to be prepared, that's all.

237
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,454
I know.

238
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:40,234
And take heart in knowing that when it comes to controlling a person,

239
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:43,245
my mother targeted my soul, my independence,

240
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:46,778
and my entire future, and at least with you, she threw in an ottoman.

241
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,451
Emily? I'm home.

242
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:55,064
I keep wanting to give this room a little spruce,

243
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:57,879
but for the life of me, every one of these fabrics gives me a headache.

244
00:12:58,406 --> 00:13:00,392
- What do you think of this one? 
- Hm? It's fine.

245
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:03,649
Well, that's just the sort of enthusiasm I was looking for.

246
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,569
Emily, you have excellent taste.

247
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,725
I'm sure whichever one you pick will look lovely.

248
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,893
- Do you need some ice? 
- No. A taller glass.

249
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:14,990
- You sound tired. 
- It's been a very long day.

250
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:17,018
You know, some men retire.

251
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:20,887
Yes, and some men tattoo their mother's names on their biceps.

252
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,330
I don't think the two are necessarily linked.

253
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,056
I'm fine, Emily.

254
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:28,122
I just need a drink and a nice meal, and I'll be good as new.

255
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:30,723
You got a call from Jason Stiles today.

256
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:33,330
Digger Stiles?

257
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:35,727
- What did he want? 
- To talk to you.

258
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,155
I have nothing to say to him.

259
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,147
He might have something interesting to tell you.

260
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:43,779
What - that the turncoat company I used to work for is cutting my pension?

261
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:47,887
That the stock they gave me when they unceremoniously forced me out has been rescinded?

262
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:50,518
Yes. That, or hello.

263
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,303
He's probably been sent to do his father's dirty work.

264
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:57,517
It's not enough to fire me, they have to continue to harass me now that I'm gone.

265
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,222
I thought you always liked Digger.

266
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,145
Yes, I liked Digger when he was fetching my coffee.

267
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:04,475
I liked Digger when he was refilling my stapler.

268
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:08,330
But I do not like Digger now that he is his father's heir apparent and sent to annoy me.

269
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:10,455
And I certainly don't understand your need to defend him.

270
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,129
I'm not defending him.

271
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:14,966
If you don't want to return the boy's call, don't return his call.

272
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:15,893
Thank you.

273
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,530
I invited him over tomorrow anyway. You can find out what he wants then.

274
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:19,646
You did what?

275
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,995
He was absolutely insistent that he talk to you.

276
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:24,812
- Why would you do that? 
- It was the polite thing to do.

277
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:27,152
If you don't want him to come over, I have his number.

278
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,389
You may call him and disinvite him. It's up to you.

279
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:32,768
Fine, he can come over, but he is not staying for a drink.

280
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,944
He can come in and deliver his message and then leave.

281
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,265
Whatever you say.

282
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,487
That's it - no drink, no handshake, nothing.

283
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:41,314
I'll even hide the liquor bottles so he doesn't get any bright ideas.

284
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:45,053
It's extremely comforting to have such a supportive wife in times like these.

285
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,127
I'm so glad.

286
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:48,917
- Did you hear? 
- Hear what?

287
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:50,853
The first party of the year is going to be on our floor.

288
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,714
Technically, it's to celebrate the first week of classes,

289
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:57,969
but I'm anticipating the themes quickly degenerating to "Hey, walking works -- let's drink."

290
00:14:58,077 --> 00:15:00,402
The important thing is that this party, the first party,

291
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,331
is going to be on our floor. Our floor.

292
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:03,452
Yes, our floor.

293
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:06,812
Anyhow, the way it works is that anyone who wants to be apart of the party

294
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:09,530
will just leave their door open so people can just wander in and out.

295
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:11,594
- So what do you think? 
- About what?

296
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:13,764
Leaving our door open. It's the perfect opportunity

297
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:15,628
to solidify our social standing at Yale.

298
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,563
It'll virtually guarantee invitations to every other party thrown this year,

299
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,116
- and we'll get our faces in people's heads. 
- I don't know.

300
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:23,585
What, what don't you know? I've explained the entire thing to you.

301
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:26,043
I'm not sure I want to leave our door open to a bunch of strangers.

302
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:28,336
They won't be strangers once they come in and say howdy.

303
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,861
Yeah, but I'm not sure how I'm gonna feel that night. I might be tired.

304
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:33,333
For God's sakes, Grandpa, you're eighteen. Sleep when you're dead.

305
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:34,855
Look, we can still go to the party.

306
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:37,117
We can meet people, you can solidify your social status,

307
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,744
get your face in people's heads, and I can bail when I feel like it.

308
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:41,782
Going isn't the same. Going is passive.

309
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,963
Opening your door, you are giving the party.

310
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:46,298
You are responsible for the fun. People owe you.

311
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,356
- Don't you want people to owe you? 
- I'm good, actually.

312
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,823
Oh, sure, you're good. You're fine.

313
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:54,494
After all, you have all this fancy furniture and a big TV to lord over people.

314
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:57,746
It's the rest of us who are screwed - the ones whose grandparents hadn't thought

315
00:15:57,853 --> 00:16:00,834
- to provide suck-up furniture. 
- This is not suck-up furniture.

316
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:03,357
You're being selfish. You don't care about anybody but yourself.

317
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:05,267
- Paris. 
- No. I hate college!

318
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:09,460
Okay, we've got costumes, we're got cutouts, we've got rings, ladies and gentlemen.

319
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,158
We've got fairy necklaces, we've got tree heads.

320
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:13,966
I'm picking up table decorations tomorrow.

321
00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:16,312
Oh, do you need me to order a Lord of the Rings cake?

322
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:19,362
- The cake is under control. 
- Okay, cake's off my list.

323
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:21,780
- So you've got the menu going, right? 
- Yes.

324
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:25,543
Just festive kiddie food. You know, like, bagel dogs, tater tots,

325
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:28,302
mini pizzas, mac and cheese. Oh, you know what would be great?

326
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:32,067
Those colored popcorn balls. Rory used to go mental over those things.

327
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,832
Hey, how many adults are gonna be there?

328
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,787
- Probably about ten. 
- Okay.

329
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:41,309
Okay, so I've scoured the entire store and here's what we got.

330
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:42,434
Hit me.

331
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:43,473
Horn of Gondor,

332
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,363
Legolas' bow, and a cape.

333
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:47,968
Cape for who?

334
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,682
There's 4,000 people in that movie who wear capes - you can't pick one?

335
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:51,905
Wow, you're crabby.

336
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,648
Well, I wore a bracelet to school today.

337
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:57,636
My parents were called. There was a special service in chapel,

338
00:16:57,701 --> 00:17:00,641
and I've been ordered to a soul-searching seminar next week.

339
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:04,276
I'll be sitting between the nail-polish-wearing girl and the spicy condiment user.

340
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:05,674
- I'm sorry. 
- That's okay.

341
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:06,952
Leave the horn, the bow, and the bill.

342
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:08,157
Right.

343
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:11,111
Hello?

344
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:12,371
I need to talk to you about Rory.

345
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:14,971
- Paris? 
- She's not adjusting well.

346
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,551
- I'm actually concerned about her. 
- Well, that's very...

347
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,133
The socialization process in college is vitally important.

348
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:23,220
The connections we make here can last a lifetime. They can alter the course of our future.

349
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:24,746
- That's how important they are. 
- Okay.

350
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:27,004
Now I'm sure it's tempting to emotionally stunt your daughter

351
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,339
so she'll move back home and take care of you in your old age,

352
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:30,706
but I thought you wanted better for her.

353
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:33,000
Hey, Paris, did something happen between you and Rory?

354
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:34,521
She won't open the door for the party.

355
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:37,188
There's a party on our floor, and if you open your door,

356
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:39,022
you get to be apart of it, but she won't open the door

357
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,099
because she's busy being Heidi's grandfather, and if you were a real mother...

358
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,820
Paris, you called my mother?

359
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:45,897
- Well, you wouldn't listen to me. 
- Give me that phone!

360
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:49,635
- Hello? 
- Hi, honey. How's school?

361
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,570
I'm rooming with a Stephen King novel.

362
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:54,094
- What's she talking about? 
- Oh, just some ridiculous party.

363
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:56,610
I don't want to let a million strangers traipse through my room,

364
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:59,056
so she's having a meltdown. I'm sorry she bothered you.

365
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:00,668
- That's okay. 
- I'm gonna kill her.

366
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,922
Remember, you cut off one head, she'll just grow another.

367
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:04,528
- So tell me about the party. 
- It's nothing,

368
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:06,481
it's just a "first week of class" kind of thing.

369
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:08,000
- Are you going? 
- Maybe.

370
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:12,189
You know, it might not be such a bad idea to get to know the people in your building,

371
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:14,744
see who's gonna be the ones to have the emergency Pop Tarts on hand.

372
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:15,763
I'll get to know them.

373
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,771
A party might be kind of a fun way to do it.

374
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:21,206
I'm sorry, are you telling me to let Paris open the door to the world?

375
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:24,851
I'm not telling you anything. I just want to make sure that at the end of four years,

376
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:28,199
you've not only read every book in the Yale library, you've also had some fun.

377
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:29,275
I will have fun.

378
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:32,086
But I can see you the night of the party holing up in your room

379
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,586
with a book for the entire evening.

380
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,982
You know when I do that, I'm not hiding. I enjoy it.

381
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:38,050
And I'm making friends - you saw me make friends.

382
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:40,502
I know, but I'm not just talking about making friends.

383
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:41,967
I'm talking about experiencing things.

384
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:44,946
Parties, football games, protests, barn burnings.

385
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,846
Very big amongst the kids these days.

386
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:48,418
Those are all experiences.

387
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,676
Maybe dumb experiences, but you never know

388
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:54,285
when you're accidentally gonna stumble across something that could be... something.

389
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,825
- Fine, I'll open the door. 
- Yes!

390
00:18:57,148 --> 00:19:00,158
- This isn't for you! 
- Like I care about the reason.

391
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,329
- You might have fun. 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:04,772
- Call me later. 
- If I don't, I'm sure Paris will.

393
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:06,963
- Tell her thanks for me. 
- I will not!

394
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,955
- What do you think? 
- What is that?

395
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:14,060
Well, you said I could borrow something to wear to the party.

396
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:17,720
Yeah, I did, but that's my Chilton uniform.

397
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:21,673
My mom probably threw it in for a joke.

398
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,400
It's my high-school uniform. I wore it every day to...

399
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:29,179
you know, there's a tie in there that goes with it.

400
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,154
Okay, I've scoped out the other open rooms and no one seems to have copped

401
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:37,095
a clear identity yet, which leaves the field wide open.

402
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:38,426
So what do you think we should be?

403
00:19:38,697 --> 00:19:40,859
We've got a lot of seating, so we could be the make-out room.

404
00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:44,371
Or we could crank the stereo up and push the furniture aside and be the dance room.

405
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,547
Or we could throw down some towels and be the keg room.

406
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:48,738
I don't want an identity. You already made me open the door.

407
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,124
I opened the door. We're the open-door room. That's it.

408
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:52,507
How about some low lighting and some candles?

409
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:53,971
We could be the meaningful-conversation room.

410
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:55,235
- No themes. 
- But...

411
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:57,268
No one knows me here, Rory.

412
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,651
Do you understand what that means?

413
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,509
It means I can start all over.

414
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,553
I can wipe out the last eighteen years and introduce people to the new Paris Geller,

415
00:20:04,774 --> 00:20:06,274
the fun Paris Geller.

416
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:10,565
I just want everything to be different this year, that's all.

417
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:12,827
- One candle. 
- Thank you, thank you.

418
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:15,531
No, seriously, give me the ring.

419
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:16,904
- No way. 
- Five bucks.

420
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:18,516
- No. 
- Just let me hold it.

421
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:19,453
Forget it.

422
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:23,590
Come on, I promise I'll give it right back, my precious.

423
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,499
- I mean, Roger. 
- You're crazy.

424
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:29,196
What? You're the one with the pointy ears, my friend.

425
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:33,104
Here we go. I'd like you to meet Redmond and Riley James.

426
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:34,824
Redmond, Riley, nice to meet you.

427
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,182
I'm Julie, your cruise director. I'm here to help you with your costumes.

428
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:40,276
- I want to be Legolas. 
- I want to be Gimli.

429
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,877
- I want to be Gimli, too. 
- Okay, two Gimlis coming up.

430
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,819
Lorelai, my hood is loose!

431
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:47,107
Her name is Julie, stupid.

432
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:49,350
No, it's not, retard!

433
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:51,878
She just told us her name was Julie. She's our cruise director.

434
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:53,604
What's a cruise director?

435
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:55,580
I don't know, but you fart with your face.

436
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:58,334
Hey, love, guys. Love, okay?

437
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,152
Lord of the Rings is all about the love.

438
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:03,962
Nuh uh, it's about the destruction of all mankind.

439
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:07,171
And who doesn't love that? You're fixed. Go play - lovingly.

440
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,786
Lorelai, some of the kids are asking for swords. Did you bring swords?

441
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,362
- Oh, no, I didn't. 
- Oh, thank God.

442
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:15,656
Oh, the Raymonds - I forgot we made up. Will you excuse me?

443
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:16,399
Absolutely.

444
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:19,338
Riley said only boy hobbits can travel to Mount Doom.

445
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:20,935
Is that true?

446
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,360
In the movie, only boy hobbits travel to Mount Doom,

447
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:27,776
but that's only because the girls went to do something even more dangerous.

448
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:28,572
What?

449
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,474
Have you ever heard of a Brazilian bikini wax?

450
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,618
- Lorelai! 
- Oh, great, you're here.

451
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,640
So girls go on adventures, too?

452
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:36,649
- And they go in heels. 
- Good.

453
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:39,904
Are Rawley and Cheech here?

454
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:41,267
Yup, they've been chopping away for an hour.

455
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:44,103
Perfect. Wow, there is a full house, isn't there?

456
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:46,090
- You have enough costumes? 
- We're good.

457
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:49,756
The screen's up, the tables are set, and four kids are crying, so we're right on schedule.

458
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:51,461
Well, I better get in the kitchen.

459
00:21:51,672 --> 00:21:55,463
All right, because it's coming up on elevenses and the hobbits are hungry, right?

460
00:21:55,572 --> 00:21:56,801
Right!

461
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:58,745
I'm going, I'm going.

462
00:21:58,822 --> 00:22:00,522
Hey, who wants a sword?

463
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,448
- Me!
- Me!

464
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,120
Well, Jason Stiles, look at you.

465
00:22:08,382 --> 00:22:11,669
Look at me - look at you. I've just got a trainer. You have cheated God.

466
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:14,091
You've been here one minute and you're already starting with the flattery.

467
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:16,101
I apologize. It is lovely to see you, Emily.

468
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:18,560
It's lovely to see you also.

469
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,878
So, did you sell your soul to the devil or...

470
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:24,121
- How's your mother? 
- She is exactly the same.

471
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,502
- And her horses? 
- Have a better life than I do.

472
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:29,942
- Well, Richard is in his study. 
- I would expect no less.

473
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:31,571
Come in.

474
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,730
Richard, there's someone here to see you.

475
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:37,541
Hello, Richard. I appreciate you taking the time to do this.

476
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:41,201
Well, I'll leave you two alone. Jason, be sure and say goodbye before you leave.

477
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:41,919
I'll do that.

478
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:46,286
- So, how have you been? 
- Fine.

479
00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:48,083
- May I sit? 
- Your choice.

480
00:22:48,252 --> 00:22:51,012
- I hear your business is going well. 
- You hear correctly.

481
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:53,420
No reason for it not to be going well. You were always the best.

482
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:57,068
Is that what you came here to tell me, how competent I was at my job?

483
00:22:57,247 --> 00:22:59,899
Nope, I came here to make you a proposition.

484
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,517
- Go ahead and make it. 
- I want to be your partner.

485
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:05,588
- Excuse me? 
- I want to join forces with you.

486
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:08,384
You know, put a desk in your office, get a copy of the key,

487
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:10,386
maybe snag some of that fancy stationery to write on.

488
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,869
- You're not serious. 
- I'm prepared to buy my way in.

489
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:16,725
I am also prepared to bring all of my current clients, and that should be appealing to you,

490
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,188
even if sharing an office and parting with some stationery is not.

491
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:22,685
Think about it. I could make your company an instant contender,

492
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:25,621
with my youth and my clients and your reputation and respectability.

493
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:28,192
It's a pretty interesting package, don't you think?

494
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,696
- You want to become my partner. 
- Yes.

495
00:23:30,836 --> 00:23:34,425
You want to pay me and bring a whole slew of high-paying clients with you.

496
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,073
You keep leaving out the stationery.

497
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:38,289
Thank you for coming, Jason.

498
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,398
- Is something wrong? 
- Yes, something's wrong.

499
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,522
- I don't appreciate you wasting my time. 
- I didn't know that I was.

500
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:48,258
- Am I such a joke to you that you feel you can come in here... 
- You're no joke.

501
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:51,239
-  ...and take my time away from important things? 
- I assure you you are no joke.

502
00:23:51,317 --> 00:23:53,113
You were the best my father's company ever had.

503
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:55,022
You're damn right I was the best that company had,

504
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,475
and now I am the best competition they will ever have.

505
00:23:57,597 --> 00:23:58,269
Not yet.

506
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:01,269
- But with me, you could be. 
- Why?

507
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:04,392
Why would you think I'd believe you were serious about this?

508
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:07,474
When was the last time I stuck a whoopee cushion on your chair, Richard?

509
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:09,876
Your father started that company. He made that company.

510
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:10,715
With you.

511
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,190
You've been working there since you were a kid.

512
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,018
All the way through Harvard, you worked there.

513
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:15,765
You've been groomed to take that company over,

514
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:17,828
and now you're telling me you want to leave?

515
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:18,887
- Yes. 
- Why?

516
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,068
Because I want to do something on my own.

517
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,992
I want to work someplace that hasn't known me since I was six.

518
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:27,064
I'd like to get through an entire day without being called Digger.

519
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:30,294
And I really, really want to piss off my dad.

520
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,115
- You what? 
- Can you imagine his face?

521
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,133
No, really, take a moment.

522
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:40,109
Picture it. I walk into his office, he's sitting in his enormous red-leather chair,

523
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:44,878
and I say, "Dad, I am leaving. I am taking all of my high-paying clients with me,

524
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,715
and I am getting into business with Richard Gilmore,

525
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:48,779
the man you forced out to make room for me."

526
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:50,505
Can you see that face?

527
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:54,702
- I can see it. 
- It's a pretty good face, isn't it?

528
00:24:55,522 --> 00:24:57,022
It is rather satisfying.

529
00:24:58,864 --> 00:24:59,500
So...

530
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:04,456
- what do you say? 
- You hate your father that much?

531
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,467
I don't hate him. I just don't want to be him.

532
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,149
Jason, would you care to join me for a drink?

533
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:14,108
Gladly.

534
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,911
Emily, Jason's going to join us for a drink.

535
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:21,138
He is? Well, how nice.

536
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,022
Richard, would you mind if I borrowed your phone?

537
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,844
Not at all. You can use the one in my study.

538
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:25,816
Thank you. I'll be right out.

539
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,052
- So, I see your meeting went well. 
- It was actually very interesting.

540
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,084
- Really? 
- He wants to be my business partner.

541
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,962
What? But what about his father and his company?

542
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:37,116
He wants to leave. He wants to work with the best.

543
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:41,141
- Well, good for Digger. 
- I always did like that boy.

544
00:25:41,366 --> 00:25:42,206
So what did you say?

545
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:44,505
Well, I told him I would have to think about it.

546
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,691
I mean, it's not as if I need anyone working with me.

547
00:25:46,998 --> 00:25:49,768
Things are going very well. I'm building a very solid client base.

548
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:51,862
It would be nice for you not to have to work so hard.

549
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:53,548
I don't mind hard work, Emily.

550
00:25:53,695 --> 00:25:56,945
I know you don't mind it. I just said that it would be nice if you didn't have to do it.

551
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,280
- Well... 
- Jason's a very nice boy.

552
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:01,217
Yes, he is.

553
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,330
He is a very nice boy.

554
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:06,526
- What are you doing? 
- I'm getting the tables ready.

555
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:08,985
- They were ready. 
- No, ready for the food.

556
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,935
- They were ready for the food. 
- No, they weren't.

557
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:12,470
Yes, they were. I set them myself.

558
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:14,739
- But where were the tablecloths? 
- Right here.

559
00:26:15,497 --> 00:26:17,318
- There. 
- They're paper.

560
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,591
Yes, they are.

561
00:26:18,982 --> 00:26:20,386
And there's monsters on them.

562
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,046
No, they're Lord of the Rings characters,

563
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:24,804
which is rather appropriate since this is a Lord of the Rings party.

564
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,402
So this is the table?

565
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:31,113
- And the paper cups and plates... 
- All there on purpose.

566
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:32,846
I thought you just put them out for the kids to see.

567
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:33,719
And use.

568
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:37,513
But the chafing dish looks so much better on the white tablecloth.

569
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,448
You shouldn't have a chafing dish out here.

570
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,401
Why not?

571
00:26:40,662 --> 00:26:42,991
Because a chafing dish has a candle, and a candle has a flame,

572
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,911
and a kid could stick his finger in there and get hurt.

573
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,914
Isn't that how they learn?

574
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:47,676
- Let's heat things up in the kitchen. 
- Fine.

575
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:50,952
You made brie.

576
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,808
With lavender honey and bourbon-sugared pecans.

577
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:57,937
I thought it would go nicely with the crudit�s platter.

578
00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,657
Please tell me you made food for the kids.

579
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:01,101
I did make food for the kids.

580
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:02,565
These kids - not the Romanov kids.

581
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,473
I just put this out in case anyone over the age of ten gets hungry.

582
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:07,670
- There are parents here, too, you know. 
- I know.

583
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:10,373
Parents whose responsibility it would be to keep their kid

584
00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:14,270
from hitting another kid or putting their fingers under a chafing dish.

585
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,810
- Sookie... 
- Fine.

586
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:18,427
Hey, having a good time?

587
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,999
I'm Paris Geller, suite five.

588
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:25,523
It's open. It's got a candle - perfect for some deep conversation.

589
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:29,543
Prepare two to five subjects to discuss so that the conversation doesn't lag

590
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:31,207
and totally ruin the vibe. Party on.

591
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:40,101
So, I did a survey of all the rooms and, by far, ours is the best.

592
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:40,685
Great.

593
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:43,315
Three is way too cluttered. Four has developed a weird smell.

594
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:46,296
Two was a contender for awhile until I started telling everyone

595
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:48,104
that the girl who lives there was waitlisted.

596
00:27:48,328 --> 00:27:49,916
I'm gonna get out there and mingle.

597
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:51,257
This is a great party.

598
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,160
Rory!

599
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:23,780
Oh, my God! Madeline, Louise, what are you doing here?

600
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:24,651
Party, baby.

601
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,627
 I thought you were supposed to be at Mills.

602
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:27,440
- Where? 
- Mills?

603
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:28,464
- Where? 
- No more Mills?

604
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:30,682
Mills went bye-bye before I unpacked my shoes.

605
00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:32,375
She's been hanging out at Tulane with me.

606
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:34,593
I love New Orleans. I am so southern.

607
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:35,473
What are you doing here?

608
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,085
We went online and found out where all the first week of class parties were,

609
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,975
- and we're making the rounds. 
- We hit Harvard next.

610
00:28:40,076 --> 00:28:42,120
- That's where my boyfriend goes. 
- Oh, you're dating a Harvard man?

611
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:44,480
- He's gonna be a writer. 
- Well, he hopes.

612
00:28:44,726 --> 00:28:46,441
Right now, he's totally freaked that The Simpsons

613
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:48,294
are going to be off the air by the time he graduates.

614
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:50,357
It's good to see you guys. Paris is around here somewhere.

615
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,945
I hope she's in back of that guy over there

616
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:53,128
because that's where I'm heading.

617
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,099
- We'll be back. 
- Good luck.

618
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:03,358
- Rory Gilmore? 
- Are you Rory Gilmore?

619
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,408
Yes, I'm Rory Gilmore.

620
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:06,261
- Rory... what can we do with that? 
- Ro-ro?

621
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:07,300
- Ry-ror? 
- Her last name might help.

622
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:09,128
- Gilmore. 
- Ro-gil? Gil-roy?

623
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:11,043
- Excuse, me, what are you doing? 
- Giving you a nick.

624
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:12,174
- A nickname. 
- Do I know you?

625
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:14,930
We get so ahead of ourselves. We're like time travelers. I'm Kick.

626
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:17,289
I'm Mickey. Your grandmother Emily told us to look you up.

627
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:18,917
- My grandmother? 
- She's tight with our mom,

628
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:22,978
D.A.R. darling. When she heard we were going to Yale, she laid down the law.

629
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,327
To look you up and make sure you fell in with the right crowd.

630
00:29:25,425 --> 00:29:27,678
- Which would be us. 
- But we never settled on a nickname.

631
00:29:27,777 --> 00:29:29,583
I think we're still trying the last-first combo.

632
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,416
Listen, I really appreciate you guys seeking me out,

633
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:34,272
and it was really nice meeting you, but I actually have to go find my roommate.

634
00:29:34,431 --> 00:29:36,018
Do you have a middle name?

635
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,204
- Yes, that might help. 
- When's your birthday?

636
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:40,580
Oh, astrological nickname.

637
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,874
- Very in. very, very in. 
- Seating.

638
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,332
Ooh, great fabric.

639
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:47,175
This is the furniture Emily bought.

640
00:29:47,462 --> 00:29:49,095
That's right. That woman does have taste.

641
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:51,491
- I wish she'd talk to Mom. 
- Yeah, 'cause then we wouldn't have to.

642
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,348
- Did Mom tell you about Christmas? 
- Yes. Hawaii.

643
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:56,175
Can't even imagine what's going through her mind.

644
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:58,316
Walt Disney could not imagine what was going through her mind.

645
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:01,972
You want the guy that pumps your gas voting?

646
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,157
- That is what America is about. 
- What ignorance!

647
00:30:04,373 --> 00:30:05,612
You're the ignorant one.

648
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:09,765
I had a terrible dream the other night that everything they say about sunscreen is true.

649
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:12,243
- I have had that dream. 
- I don't think I'm having fun.

650
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:14,382
- Well, the party's not over yet. 
- I know.

651
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:17,348
- What's with the Gabor sisters? 
- Friends from my grandmother.

652
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,170
Great. Everybody has a group but me.

653
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:20,209
What are you talking about?

654
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,917
Janet's a runner, so she'll automatically be in the jock group.

655
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:25,596
Tanna's a freak, so she'll be in the John Nash group.

656
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,443
You've got your grandmother's obligation friends,

657
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,152
and I'm stuck over there listening to a bad talk-radio session.

658
00:30:30,332 --> 00:30:31,131
This sucks.

659
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,339
Well, we could just kick everyone out and just go to bed.

660
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:35,774
No. I'll just have to try a little harder.

661
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:37,162
I'm determined.

662
00:30:37,699 --> 00:30:39,071
Things are going to be different this year.

663
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:42,769
Hey. pierce my ear.

664
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:46,327
Okay, everybody out, now! This room is closed.

665
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,758
Take your gross beer and your inane conversations somewhere else.

666
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:51,509
- Move! 
- What's going on?

667
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:55,261
I don't know. Looks like my roommate's kicking everybody out. Oh shoot.

668
00:30:55,445 --> 00:30:57,592
Hey, Bim and Bim, up. Let's move, now.

669
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:01,934
Sorry. She's my roommate. What can I do? Call me.

670
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:17,559
Lorelai, some of the kids are starting to get hungry.

671
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:20,160
I think we should have the food ready to go the minute the movie's over.

672
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:21,480
I agree. I'll get right on that.

673
00:31:24,938 --> 00:31:29,008
- Helen wants us to put the food on. 
- Oh, one step ahead of you.

674
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:29,714
Good, good.

675
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,834
So, what do we have here?

676
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:34,302
A little lemon-garlic aioli for the blanched veggies.

677
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:35,023
Oh, great.

678
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:38,070
You think I should put the assorted charcuteries on this table or this one?

679
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,263
It depends. Which one is the kids' table?

680
00:31:40,527 --> 00:31:43,190
There are no designated tables. I'm mixing and matching here.

681
00:31:44,723 --> 00:31:46,688
Oh, perfect. Right here.

682
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,261
- Hello, gorgeous. What's your name? 
- Oh, boy. Wow.

683
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,721
I'm hungry.

684
00:31:52,268 --> 00:31:54,173
- Would you like some gravlax? 
- Some what?

685
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:55,483
Sookie, where's the kids' food?

686
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,143
Okay, you need to relax.

687
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,941
I haven't put the kids' food out yet because you wouldn't let me use the chafing dishes

688
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,062
and I didn't want the food to get cold.

689
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:03,947
- What did you just do? 
- Sookie.

690
00:32:04,014 --> 00:32:07,654
You just stuck that carrot in your mouth and then put it back on the platter.

691
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:10,148
- Why would you do that? 
- It tastes like diapers.

692
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,561
It does not taste like diapers.

693
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,650
Honey, why don't you go sit down. I'll call you when dinner's ready.

694
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:15,739
- You take it back! 
- Okay, come on.

695
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:19,763
- What are you doing? 
- Where is it?

696
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:22,037
- Where is what? 
- The food that doesn't taste like diapers.

697
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:24,397
- You mean the kids' food? 
- Yes, the kids' food. Did you make any?

698
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:26,466
- I'm not stupid. 
- I never said you were stupid.

699
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:29,446
You know, I booked this gig. I'm the one who came to you and said,

700
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:32,128
"Hey, you want to cater a kids' party with me?"

701
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:36,594
Here. Here is the children's food for the children's birthday party, okay?

702
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,084
- What is that? 
- It's macaroni and cheese.

703
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:39,731
It's green. Why is it green?

704
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:42,496
Because I made it with a jalapeno-chipotle cream sauce.

705
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:43,613
Kids aren't gonna eat this.

706
00:32:43,813 --> 00:32:45,677
- When they try it... 
- They won't even try it.

707
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,453
- Why not? 
- Because it's green.

708
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:50,091
You haven't even offered it to them yet. They may surprise you.

709
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,896
- Where is the rest of it? 
- The rest of what?

710
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:53,808
- The rest of the kid food. 
- This is it.

711
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:56,996
- Sookie! 
- They're small! How much can they eat?

712
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,660
We talked about this. I mentioned hot dogs and pizza puffs and chips.

713
00:33:02,913 --> 00:33:05,758
I told you to make popcorn balls. Where the hell are the popcorn balls?

714
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:07,375
You were serious about that?

715
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,520
Oh, my God!

716
00:33:10,268 --> 00:33:11,854
Is that the cake?

717
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:15,527
Of course it's the cake. You think I would go to a birthday party without a cake?

718
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:17,304
What kind of cake is it, Sookie?

719
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:18,869
Chocolate.

720
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,950
With a rum-raisin, tropical-fruit ganache.

721
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,246
Cheech? Uh, here.

722
00:33:28,142 --> 00:33:32,693
Go to Doose's, okay, and get, like, five boxes of frozen mini pizzas

723
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:35,392
and five boxes of those pigs in a blanket and all the chips you can find.

724
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:37,419
And then go to Weston's, get a couple dozen cupcakes,

725
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:39,780
and have Mamie give you a couple of big bags of jimmies -

726
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:41,977
like chocolate, rainbow, whatever.

727
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:43,082
What are you doing?

728
00:33:43,246 --> 00:33:46,349
We'll have them decorate their own cupcakes. They'll love it. Okay, go.

729
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:48,816
We're going to serve them cupcakes?

730
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:51,597
Maybe they have something to tide them over for a little while.

731
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,574
Hey, hey, I'm talking here.

732
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:55,856
Yeah, I know. Just relax. It's gonna be fine.

733
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,545
I know it's gonna be fine because I've been cooking all week long.

734
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:01,448
I made four different cakes before choosing that particular one.

735
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,644
So, yeah, I know it's gonna be fine.

736
00:34:03,772 --> 00:34:05,195
But the kids won't eat that.

737
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,874
You know what, I'm getting a little tired of you telling me what the kids won't eat.

738
00:34:07,961 --> 00:34:10,213
You are supposed to plan the party, and I'm supposed to do the cooking.

739
00:34:10,388 --> 00:34:11,008
That's the arrangement. 

740
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:13,188
Yes, but you have to think about the client, Sookie.

741
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,752
I am thinking about the client. That cake is incredible.

742
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:19,015
- Not if you're an 8-year-old. 
- How do you know?

743
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:21,646
Because I had an 8-year-old, and she hung out with other 8-year-olds,

744
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,960
and my taste right now is not that different from an 8-year-old.

745
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:27,022
Okay, you can't just walk in and take over. That's not the arrangement.

746
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:29,588
You're not in charge here. We're partners.

747
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,134
- I know that. 
- I'm a great chef.

748
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:34,964
A great chef does not have the client decorate his own cupcakes.

749
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:38,204
- Can I have a juice box? 
- Hey, we're talking!

750
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:41,312
Oh, yeah...

751
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:44,154
What's the matter with her? Is she sick?

752
00:34:44,261 --> 00:34:46,340
Why is her mouth open? Lorelai, look at her face.

753
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,367
Hi, honey. There's your juice. It's grape. Do you like grape?

754
00:34:49,617 --> 00:34:52,951
Me, too! It makes your tongue all purple.

755
00:34:53,411 --> 00:34:56,488
Now take your juice and go watch the rest of the movie, all right?

756
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,398
You look very nice in your costume.

757
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:02,771
Okay, Sookie, I didn't mean to just take over like that.

758
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:07,609
I felt a crisis coming on so I snapped into problem-solving mode, and I didn't think.

759
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,601
- I can't do this. 
- Yes, you can.

760
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,767
We just need to be clearer on the menu next time.

761
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:13,937
No, not this. This.

762
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:17,793
Isn't it a little late?

763
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:21,142
You saw me with that little girl. I mean, and her face...

764
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:23,702
- I made that face. 
- You were upset.

765
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:27,870
This is not right. This is all wrong. I don't...

766
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:29,866
I don't want to be pregnant anymore!

767
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,353
What are you gonna do, walk it off?

768
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,448
Sookie, Sookie...

769
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:40,525
- Where are you going? 
- A child is not a duvet cover.

770
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:42,795
You can't just take it back if it doesn't like you.

771
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:45,765
Luckily, duvet covers notoriously like whoever they go home with.

772
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:46,885
They're like golden retrievers.

773
00:35:46,982 --> 00:35:49,579
You know what happens when kids don't like you? They tie you to a chair.

774
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:52,772
They brain you with a bat. They set fire to the house and blame it on the neighbors.

775
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,939
Wow, now you can't have kids or live next door to them.

776
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:57,100
I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know how to feed them,

777
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,767
I cover up their party cloths, and I set their fingers on fire.

778
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:00,745
Just this once.

779
00:36:00,878 --> 00:36:05,271
I make them eat jalapeno-chipotle cream sauce. I'm Mommie Dearest.

780
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:07,551
- Okay, back in the kitchen. 
- No, I can't go back.

781
00:36:07,657 --> 00:36:09,096
- I've got hummus in there. 
- Come on.

782
00:36:09,495 --> 00:36:10,734
God knows what I'll do with it!

783
00:36:12,526 --> 00:36:16,383
Rawley, could you just go make sure the kids have enough soda?

784
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:20,484
- You just have to calm down. 
- I can't have it.

785
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,835
- Yes, you can. 
- No, I can't.

786
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:24,866
I'm gonna fail. Get it out, get it out, get it out!

787
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,907
Stop. Breathe. Drink.

788
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:31,516
Everything's gonna be fine.

789
00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:35,285
Kids don't like me, and I'm not so sure I like them.

790
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:36,437
You'll like your kid.

791
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:38,881
You know at family gatherings when everyone goes into the living room,

792
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:41,035
gathers around, watches the kids? I read.

793
00:36:41,147 --> 00:36:43,169
Jackson's sister has a little girl, six years old.

794
00:36:43,297 --> 00:36:46,370
She likes to get up in front of the family after dinner and sing Mariah Carey songs.

795
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:49,310
I heckle. I have no desire to play with them.

796
00:36:49,452 --> 00:36:53,170
Easter egg hunts bore me. I have never borrowed the neighbor's kid

797
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,451
- to look after for the afternoon. 
- Good. That's called kidnapping.

798
00:36:56,651 --> 00:37:01,203
"Come on, Jackson, let's have a baby. I wanna be a mommy." I'm pathetic.

799
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,451
You're not pathetic.

800
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:06,501
I'm gonna be a bad mother. I should not be a parent.

801
00:37:06,629 --> 00:37:09,303
Sookie, look at me.

802
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:13,307
There are many people in this world who should not have been parents.

803
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,554
Mr. and Mrs. Hitler, for example.

804
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,615
The bin Ladens could have just watched TV that night.

805
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:21,821
Richard and Emily might have taken a pass at procreating.

806
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:23,694
But you...

807
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:27,217
no way. You're gonna be a great parent.

808
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,608
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

809
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:30,909
How do you know?

810
00:37:31,493 --> 00:37:35,235
Because I know you, and I watched you with Rory when she was growing up.

811
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:37,094
Well, who could not like Rory?

812
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:40,689
You're gonna be amazing. That little boy of yours is very lucky.

813
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:41,896
Okay.

814
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:44,928
- I guess it's gonna be okay. 
- Yeah.

815
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:47,953
Okay. Okay.

816
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,742
- I'm really, really okay. 
- Yeah, okay.

817
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,539
- Someone threw up on the table. 
- Oh, God.

818
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,203
I'm okay. I'm just gonna go over there and be... okay.

819
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:06,058
Good idea.

820
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:47,741
- I'm on the floor. 
- You were sleeping.

821
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:51,182
- I have no clothes on. 
- No, you don't.

822
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:54,069
I'm on the floor, I have no clothes on,

823
00:38:54,806 --> 00:38:57,203
and you're a girl, so I must be...

824
00:38:57,309 --> 00:38:58,968
- On the wrong floor. 
- Oh, boy.

825
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:01,268
- Where's your room? 
- I think up.

826
00:39:01,652 --> 00:39:03,219
- Are we on the first floor? 
- Yes.

827
00:39:03,372 --> 00:39:05,486
Then up. Any idea how long I've been here?

828
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:09,460
So you have no idea how many people have walked by while I've...

829
00:39:09,643 --> 00:39:10,986
- Sorry. 
- Great.

830
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:15,292
Now for the rest of my time at Yale, I'm gonna be "the naked guy."

831
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:16,219
I'm sorry.

832
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:17,621
And you know what's really great?

833
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:22,045
Tomorrow, when the "naked guy" nickname starts spreading around campus like wildfire,

834
00:39:22,302 --> 00:39:24,631
I'm gonna be in my third hour of throwing up.

835
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:26,678
It's been really quiet out here for a while now,

836
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,607
so there's a chance that no one but me has actually seen you yet.

837
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,625
- Oh yeah? 
- I promise I won't say anything.

838
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:34,846
And if there's a chance that you could refrain from,

839
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:37,517
you know, being naked again in the wrong hallway at the next party,

840
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,143
then there's a chance you might get a completely different nickname,

841
00:39:40,282 --> 00:39:42,309
like "the never-naked guy."

842
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:44,706
You're a very kind person.

843
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:45,955
Wait. Hold on.

844
00:39:46,436 --> 00:39:47,794
You can borrow this.

845
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:52,155
Thanks.

846
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:57,238
Hey, weren't you in my Japanese Fiction class today?

847
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,878
Yeah, that's right.

848
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:00,071
I thought so.

849
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:03,783
Hi, I'm... Marty.

850
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:06,420
Rory.

851
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:09,252
- I won't remember that tomorrow. 
- That's perfectly understandable.

852
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:11,192
So I should probably try and find my room.

853
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:14,238
And my pants, 'cause that's where I kept my keys.

854
00:40:14,484 --> 00:40:17,489
- So pants first. 
- Right, pants first.

855
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:19,471
Night.

856
00:40:21,447 --> 00:40:23,209
I'm officially stupider than my brother.

857
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:25,586
I never thought that would happen.

858
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:36,402
I decided I'm going to do it.

859
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:37,790
To do what?

860
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,236
I'm going to go in there and I'm going to tell Grandma

861
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:41,825
that she's going to butt out of my life.

862
00:40:42,749 --> 00:40:44,283
- Can I... 
- What are you doing?

863
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:47,974
Just checking. So you have soberly decided to confront my mother?

864
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:49,931
Are you sure you want to do this?

865
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:53,044
All right, then I support you one hundred percent.

866
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:53,807
Thank you.

867
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:55,025
Just make sure you wait for the right moment.

868
00:40:55,215 --> 00:40:56,341
Oh, the right moment is now.

869
00:40:56,546 --> 00:41:00,150
The right moment arrived in a big pink hat full of feathers screaming,

870
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:01,814
"Notice me because I am here!"

871
00:41:02,115 --> 00:41:03,949
Oh, well, if it was wearing a hat...

872
00:41:09,787 --> 00:41:11,075
- There they are. 
- Hi, Mom.

873
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:11,905
Come in.

874
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:15,137
I tell you, this day has been an absolute circus.

875
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:18,100
I misplaced every single thing I needed -

876
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:22,068
my grocery list, my ticket for the shoe repair. It was a nightmare.

877
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:24,783
- What will you girls have? 
- Wait for the moment, wait for the moment.

878
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:27,706
Grandma, I have to talk to you about something.

879
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:29,636
Yes, Rory, what is it?

880
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:35,109
I have an announcement.

881
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,381
I am going into business with Jason Stiles.

882
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:40,106
Who?

883
00:41:40,691 --> 00:41:42,472
You've met him - the Stiles boy.

884
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:43,851
Oh, Digger.

885
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:46,200
Nobody's called him Digger in years, Lorelai.

886
00:41:46,481 --> 00:41:47,772
And yes, I just got off the phone.

887
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:50,470
We're going to get together later and hash out the details.

888
00:41:50,654 --> 00:41:52,267
Richard, that is wonderful.

889
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,819
I didn't know you were looking for a partner.

890
00:41:53,968 --> 00:41:55,605
He wasn't. Jason came to him.

891
00:41:55,856 --> 00:41:58,847
That's right. He said he wanted to strike out on his own,

892
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,341
he wanted to work with the best,

893
00:42:00,547 --> 00:42:02,794
and he wanted to screw over his father.

894
00:42:02,947 --> 00:42:05,067
- What? 
- Oh, excuse me, Rory.

895
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:06,460
You never told me about this.

896
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:08,825
Well, I was a bit surprised at the beginning,

897
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:12,486
but I have to admit that when he told me that part of his motive was revenge,

898
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:15,092
I was intrigued. No, I was tickled.

899
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:18,717
I thought it was wonderful. What a wonderful world we live in

900
00:42:18,884 --> 00:42:23,094
that the son of my enemy hates his father and that I benefit from it all.

901
00:42:23,325 --> 00:42:25,071
It's downright Elizabethan.

902
00:42:25,952 --> 00:42:27,641
I don't think this is very funny, Richard.

903
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:31,932
No, no, I suppose not. However, I can't stop smiling.

904
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:34,205
I don't think you should go into business with this boy.

905
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,190
- Oh, now, Emily. 
- He's obviously very troubled.

906
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:40,129
You certainly don't need to hand over your business to a troubled youth.

907
00:42:40,242 --> 00:42:43,120
- He's 37 years old. 
- Yes, he's 37 years old,

908
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:45,256
and all he can think about is how to get back at his father.

909
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:48,542
- I don't understand that kind of thinking. 
- You know Floyd - he's horrible.

910
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:52,688
He is the boy's father. He raised him. He clothed him. He fed him.

911
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:57,061
He does not deserve to be paid back for all of his love and devotion like this.

912
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,646
- Why are you getting so upset? 
- I don't want to talk about it anymore.

913
00:42:59,755 --> 00:43:01,244
Oh, Emily, be reasonable.

914
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:02,960
I never liked that Digger in the first place.

915
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,649
Oh, Emily, come back here.

916
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,479
It wasn't the right moment.

917
00:43:15,488 --> 00:43:17,213
I was about to when Grandpa came in.

918
00:43:17,351 --> 00:43:19,441
He interrupted, and now Grandma's mad,

919
00:43:19,574 --> 00:43:22,231
so I'm sorry if it seems to you like I chickened out, but I didn't,

920
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:23,947
and now it's just gonna have to wait.
