1
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:12,826
- Oh, my god!
- What is that?

2
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:14,932
- Is it in the house?
- It's church bells.

3
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:16,749
How'd the church bells get in the house?

4
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:18,395
- They're outside.
- In the yard?

5
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,435
No, at the church. What time is it?

6
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:22,510
It's 3:12.

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,931
Why are the church bells ringing at 3:12?

8
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:26,654
I was having a dream, too.

9
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:29,814
I was shopping for a car and I
wanted to see the trunk space

10
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:32,855
'cause I have a truck and it's
convenient to haul things.

11
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:35,109
So I wanted to see what the deal with the
car was, and the salesman opened it.

12
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:38,217
I asked him how many cubic feet it was
and he looked it up in the manual

13
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:42,556
and I was satisfied.
So when he closed the hood, the bells rang.

14
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:44,395
You have very mundane dreams.

15
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:46,392
Town meeting. Town meeting.

16
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:46,997
What was that?

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,893
Some dead guy yelling something.

18
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:50,546
Ghosts are yelling something
outside the house?

19
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:53,840
No, guys I'm gonna kill yelling
stuff outside the house.

20
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:54,881
Town meeting.

21
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:55,815
What are they saying?

22
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,384
There was a clown beating?

23
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:58,144
Not again.

24
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:00,179
Town meeting. Town meeting.

25
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:02,280
No, they're saying, "town meeting."

26
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:04,404
Town meeting? At this hour?

27
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:06,355
What the hell is Taylor up to?

28
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:07,615
- All right.
- Let's get back to sleep.

29
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:08,849
- Guess we better go.
- What?

30
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:10,126
- I'm going back to bed.
- I'm not going back to sleep.

31
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:12,378
Come on, it's a town meeting.

32
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:13,567
It's the middle of the night.

33
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,421
Sorry, we might miss something.

34
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:22,183
Oh, good-- full house.

35
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:24,958
Just goes to show how easily
manipulated we all are.

36
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,886
You ring a bell, we drool like dogs.

37
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:29,159
Just don't drool where we sit.
It'll be messy.

38
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:30,449
Hey, you guys hear the bells?

39
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:33,931
No, we were just on one of our spontaneous
3:00-in-the-morning strolls,

40
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,011
saw everybody in here, and wondered, "hey,
what's up?"

41
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:37,074
- Really?
- No.

42
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:38,765
He's cranky at 3:00 in the morning.

43
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,918
Any idea what this is about?

44
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,383
Taylor's not even here yet.

45
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:44,727
Kirk's up there, futzing with something,
but he won't tell us what's going on.

46
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:47,061
We're just about ready here, folks.

47
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:48,312
Ready for what? What is this?

48
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:49,293
Here we go.

49
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:52,479
Greetings, everyone.

50
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:53,288
Taylor?

51
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:54,650
He's in a little box.

52
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:56,088
The nightmare continues.

53
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,488
Is it looking okay, Kirk?

54
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:59,342
Yeah, you could use a little pancake.

55
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:01,675
Weird. I can still smell his cologne.

56
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:05,008
People, we have a tremendous problem
that needs our immediate attention.

57
00:02:05,094 --> 00:02:08,217
That's why I chose the extraordinary
step of broadcasting to you

58
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,111
tonight from this remote location.

59
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:11,363
- Ow!
- What was that?

60
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:12,556
Looked like a ping-pong ball.

61
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,262
Now, as we all know, the annual Stars Hollow
Winter Carnival is this weekend.

62
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:18,195
Ow!

63
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,199
Timmy, do not throw ping-pong balls at me.

64
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:21,984
You're a doo-doo head.

65
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:25,089
And do not call me a doo-doo head.
I'm in the middle of something important.

66
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:26,439
Where the hell are you, Taylor?

67
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,339
I'm at my sister's in Maine.

68
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:32,948
Anyway, we have never not had a
Stars Hollow Winter Carnival.

69
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,936
It's a 125-year tradition.

70
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,143
Is he getting to the point soon?

71
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:37,376
Yeah, come on, doo-doo head.

72
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,177
Fine, let's cut to the chase.

73
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:42,464
I run the winter carnival, it's this weekend,

74
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,852
and I am snowed in,
unable to get back into town.

75
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,300
So, what's this about, Taylor?

76
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:54,815
Maybe it's the lateness of the hour or
the computer connection isn't clear.

77
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:55,617
Doo-doo head!

78
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:57,968
We have never had to cancel a carnival,

79
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:02,183
and it's absolutely impossible for me
to get back into town to run it.

80
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,963
I must be tired. I'm not getting this.

81
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,296
It's like a riddle or something.

82
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:08,413
People, are you not hearing me?

83
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:11,134
I won't be there to run the carnival.

84
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,895
Draw the obvious conclusion.

85
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:14,748
Oh, okay, I got it now.

86
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:15,956
Thank you, Patty.

87
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,773
Kirk, could you take it over?

88
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,258
Sure.

89
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:20,246
Great. Anything else, Taylor?

90
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:24,387
Oh, well, good for you, people.
I guess we don't have to cancel it after all.

91
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,131
Thanks, Taylor. Come on,
let's get you to bed.

92
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:28,506
I'm gonna fall back to sleep and dream about

93
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:31,182
running Taylor over in that
car I was looking at.

94
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:33,264
Is there enough room to put
his body in the trunk?

95
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:37,504
Now, then, I would recommend that we
immediately start discussing some details.

96
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,552
The sooner, the better is always best.
Now, then, food.

97
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,530
We'll obviously have the carnival staples--

98
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:47,492
french dip sandwiches, corn on the cob,
apple cider, et cetera.

99
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,578
Now, we almost ran out of
hot chocolate last year,

100
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,233
so I would recommend upping
the supply by 11%.

101
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:55,994
Timmy!

102
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:58,089
Put down that Rubik's cube.

103
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:00,744
Timmy, do not throw that Rubik's cube at me.

104
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,434
Here...

105
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:53,944
Here...

106
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:55,156
Here.

107
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:56,501
This was tea.

108
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:58,890
Now you got a hybrid.
That's very in right now.

109
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:01,349
I've gotten so much done this morning,
it's scary.

110
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,631
- Coffee?
- I already got some.

111
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:06,118
I saw the sunrise. I paid all my bills.
I already got some, hon.

112
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:08,822
And this is a first-- I saw the
beginning of Katie Couric.

113
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:11,820
I don't think I've seen the first
five minutes of her in my life.

114
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,689
You know,
she and Matt Lauer are much more serious

115
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:15,819
in the first half-hour than
they are later on.

116
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,882
I guess that makes sense.

117
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:19,891
You can afford to make people
sad and angry about war

118
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:21,761
and the economy and stuff
when they first wake up.

119
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:23,843
But then,
just as they're heading to the office,

120
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,457
you leave them with a dose
of Matthew McConaughey,

121
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,206
people's sexiest man,
and they're rarin' to go.

122
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:32,448
Yeah, Matthew McConaughey
always gets me rarin'.

123
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:36,260
And I'm even volunteering to man a
booth at the carnival this year.

124
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:37,579
I got a great concept, too.

125
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:39,274
What about you?
You got anything special planned today?

126
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:41,240
Today? No, not today.

127
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:44,741
It's a bunch of the same old,
same old errands. The usual.

128
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:46,582
Not liking my "hybrid."

129
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:47,568
Coming.

130
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:49,099
I'll call you later.

131
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:50,786
See what you did here?

132
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,037
Sorry.

133
00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:55,754
No, wait, I want the one I had already.
Oh, well, okay.

134
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:20,410
Oh, terrific.

135
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:22,375
Bring 'em on in, Algernon. The more,
the merrier.

136
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,931
It's Logan's doing. What can I do?

137
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,012
Tell him to stop.

138
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:26,254
We're not speaking, remember?

139
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:28,374
Well, they're putting our lives in jeopardy.

140
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:29,345
Oh, stop it.

141
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:31,819
They scream bling,
draw eyes to the apartment.

142
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:34,129
Bad guys see roses,
then they come for our diamonds.

143
00:06:34,248 --> 00:06:35,392
We don't have diamonds.

144
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,716
The doo-wop group doesn't know that.

145
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:40,767
Yeah, by the window is good, next to the neon
sign that says "come pistol-whip us."

146
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:41,924
Fine, I'll hide them.

147
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,857
You know,
I see Logan at the paper a few times a week.

148
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:45,310
I can lean on him, make him stop.

149
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,924
He's going to get the message eventually.

150
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:48,104
Well, he better get it quick.

151
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:50,474
Between the paper and classes,
I'm only home a few hours a day.

152
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,522
I'd rather not spend them in mortal fear.

153
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:54,789
Paris.

154
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:56,275
Yeah?

155
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,196
U.P.S.-- Got a package for Rory Gilmore.

156
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,075
From?

157
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,375
Harry and David.

158
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:03,517
Great. Fancy fruit.

159
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,640
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:07,367
Step back from the door and keep
your hands where I can see them.

161
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:22,634
Surprise.

162
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:24,825
Was this not a planned thing?

163
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:25,544
Why?

164
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:26,763
You said, "surprise."

165
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:29,514
No, it was just-- how you doing?

166
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,394
Good.

167
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,074
This is how the avian flu spreads,
by the way.

168
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:33,956
Oh, sorry!

169
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:34,854
I was just saying.

170
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:37,003
No, I heard that, too.
Heard a guy on CNN say it.

171
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:39,712
Right. They fired my favorite-- Aaron Brown.
He was comforting.

172
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,452
Yes, he was.

173
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,435
- Mind if I sit?
- No, go ahead.

174
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:53,485
So... do you like to hang out here?

175
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:54,741
The park? No.

176
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:56,764
Then why are we meeting here?

177
00:07:57,002 --> 00:07:58,734
I thought kids liked parks.

178
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:01,915
It's 41 degrees out.
Not exactly peak park-going season.

179
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:05,219
But there's still stuff to do, right? I mean,
we could have a snowball fight or something.

180
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:07,642
My friend Remi got into a snowball
fight with a guy once

181
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:09,540
and she got a retina detached.

182
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,320
Well, we'll skip that, then.

183
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:16,486
Uh... sorry. I'll think of something
better to do next time, okay?

184
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:19,802
I don't really know what kids are into.

185
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:20,730
Hey, whatever.

186
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,102
Oh, and I said "next time." I don't
know if you caught that.

187
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:24,926
I did.

188
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:28,712
Did your mom explain that this isn't
necessarily a one-time thing?

189
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:33,663
I was thinking maybe we could make it
semiregular or even just, you know, regular.

190
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,134
Uh, okay.

191
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,613
Good. So, what's your free time like?

192
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,009
I've got no school this whole week.

193
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:40,914
It's year-round, so we get weird times off.

194
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:44,489
Well, then maybe we can do something
tomorrow, too, something less cold.

195
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:45,352
Okay.

196
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:47,721
So, what kind of things do you like to do?

197
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,475
I like Morse code. I'm learning that.

198
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,257
My mom gave me a putter, so I putt some.

199
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:55,384
And I like talking to my Indian friend
Shamilah in Bangalore over the internet.

200
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,094
I wouldn't be much help with any of that.

201
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:04,156
We could bowl or go to a movie or maybe
there's a zoo around somewhere.

202
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:06,249
How about I just come and
hang out at the diner?

203
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:07,514
What diner? My diner?

204
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,298
Yeah.

205
00:09:08,578 --> 00:09:09,618
Won't it be boring?

206
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:11,570
No way. Diners fascinate me--

207
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,748
the hustle, the bustle, the monte cristos.

208
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,117
The diner?

209
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,682
Yeah, that'd be fun.

210
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:17,985
Can't think of anything else, huh?

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,333
I think it'd be great.

212
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:22,190
Well, okay, sure. The diner.

213
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:24,013
Tomorrow you will come to the diner.

214
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:30,297
So, what do you want to do right now?

215
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:33,426
I've been counting how many times those
frisbee guys over there have dropped it.

216
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:35,583
Oh, okay. Let's keep watching.

217
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,781
The one with the hat's a big,
fat butterfingers.

218
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,559
Kirk, you needed carnival-game
volunteers and I volunteered.

219
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:48,484
What's with the hassle?

220
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:50,945
We do things like ring toss
and rope ladder climbing.

221
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,256
Your choice is unorthodox.

222
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:53,509
That's because I'm not orthodox.

223
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:57,204
I'm liberal with a touch of reform
and a smidgen of zippity-pow.

224
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:59,669
You're aware that this is the first time
I'm running the winter carnival?

225
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:00,439
I am aware.

226
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:02,130
I can't afford to have anything go wrong.

227
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,128
Kirk, I promise this booth will be a big hit.

228
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,955
It will not embarrass you, okay? I promise.

229
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,175
Your promise means nothing to me.
You break them all the time.

230
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,180
I do not.

231
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:13,177
1997-- you promised to bring me
back a souvenir pen and ink set

232
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,745
from your trip to colonial Williamsburg.

233
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:15,627
I did?

234
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,657
1999-- you promised to put in a good
word for me at Al's Pancake World

235
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:20,361
when Al had that batter boy opening.

236
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,654
He calls them "batter boys"?

237
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,839
Year 2000-- you promised to teach me to swim.

238
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:26,060
I still don't know how to swim.
What if there's a tsunami?

239
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:29,289
2001-- you promised to come to my birthday
party, and I waited and waited.

240
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:32,250
Kirk, scout's honor,
this booth will make you proud, okay?

241
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:35,780
Now... Excuse me, hi.
Are you Liam Driessen by any chance?

242
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:37,720
- I am.
- Hi, Lorelai Gilmore.

243
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:41,122
I'm here to make your stay and the rest of
the New England maple syrup council's

244
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:42,535
stay as comfortable as possible.

245
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:43,761
So far, so good.

246
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:45,553
Love the local color here.

247
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,877
Kirk, it's really not appropriate to be
standing right next to me like this.

248
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,546
- But we work together.
- But not here.

249
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,357
- Liam, can I ask you a question?
- No, that's inappropriate, too...

250
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:55,964
Would you pay a dollar to have
your fortune told by a dog?

251
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:56,721
A dog?

252
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,504
It's for a carnival. It's very cute.

253
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:01,169
A dog that has no experience
telling people's fortunes?

254
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:02,267
I don't know.

255
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,717
Well, you're no help.

256
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,880
Well, just part of our local color.
He's purple.

257
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:10,144
Get it? 'Cause local color and he's a color.

258
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:11,271
And how about a tour?

259
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:12,125
Sure.

260
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:25,037
That's what we got?

261
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,144
It's posed, staged.

262
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:28,641
Get another and make it candid.

263
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:29,126
Candid?

264
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:30,422
Don't question me.

265
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:32,305
But it's a team photo.

266
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:34,661
Bill, how's it hangin'?

267
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:36,000
It's hanging okay.

268
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:37,042
Good, good.

269
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:38,736
You like the Washington Post, do you?

270
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,425
Yes.

271
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:42,062
Because they like to split their infinitives,
the Washington Post,

272
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,845
especially their metro writers, but I don't.

273
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,655
"The council member chose to forcefully
waive her right of veto."

274
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:50,347
Consider it unsplit.

275
00:11:58,745 --> 00:11:59,505
Hey.

276
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:00,595
You check in?

277
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:01,208
Check in?

278
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:01,916
The board.

279
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,878
The new system?

280
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:06,308
This is the best way for me to know
where anyone is at any given time.

281
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:08,200
All the names are on the left.

282
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:10,670
Each colored magnet represents an activity.

283
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:12,704
If you're out on assignment,
it's a red magnet.

284
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,552
If you're in the John, it's a blue magnet.

285
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,201
If you're at home, a purple magnet.

286
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:18,700
If you're at your desk, it's a green magnet.

287
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,883
But if they're at their desk, you
can just glance over and see
that they're at their desk.

288
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:23,617
But I'd have to glance all around.

289
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:25,474
This saves extraneous glancing.

290
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,623
Look, it's not really for people like you.

291
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:28,659
I know you're dedicated.

292
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,582
I trust you,
but I can't appear to be playing favorites.

293
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:32,533
I have a class.

294
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:33,619
Orange magnet.

295
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:42,300
Excuse me.

296
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,421
You're Rory Gilmore?

297
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:44,166
Yes.

298
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:45,586
Someone pointed you out to me.

299
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:46,559
This is for you.

300
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:47,184
What is?

301
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:48,401
The coffee cart.

302
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:49,207
For me?

303
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:50,926
Courtesy of Logan Huntzberger.

304
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:53,183
Oh, I see.

305
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,109
Well, I don't want any coffee right now.

306
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,150
Thanks anyway,
and sorry you wasted your time, Ben.

307
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:58,203
No problem.

308
00:12:58,784 --> 00:12:59,938
What are you doing?

309
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:01,615
I'm hired for the day.

310
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:02,806
What?

311
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:04,171
Yep, all day.

312
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:07,767
Any time you want some coffee, biscotti,
I will be here.

313
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,863
That's not necessary.

314
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,777
I've already been paid-- a lot!

315
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:14,698
Fine.

316
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:23,436
Kiddo, is that the TV?

317
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:24,372
Yes.

318
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:26,085
You watching something stupid?

319
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:26,791
Yes.

320
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,441
- You promise?
- Yes.

321
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:29,710
Okay.

322
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:32,886
Hello?

323
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:34,583
Hi, Anna. It's Luke.

324
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:35,745
Hey there.

325
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,938
So, she came back with all
her fingers and toes.

326
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,725
Very successful first outing.

327
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:42,922
Yeah, it was nice. It was real nice.

328
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:44,591
She had a good time, too,

329
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,664
and that's impressive 'cause she's picky.

330
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:48,284
Good. Well, so did I.

331
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,084
So, she's coming by your work tomorrow?

332
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:52,925
Oh, she told you that, huh?

333
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,317
Well, listen, here's the thing.

334
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:58,104
I don't know if...

335
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,087
it's gonna work out for her
to come to the diner.

336
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:02,012
Why not?

337
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,438
Well, it's gonna be really hectic,
lots of people swooshing around and all.

338
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:07,671
She'll like that.

339
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:09,493
She likes people swooshing around her.

340
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:10,810
Pans of hot grease.

341
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:12,976
There will be pans of hot grease
swooshing around her?

342
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,454
If she's in the kitchen, yeah.

343
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:17,315
Well, keep her out of the kitchen
if there's any grease swooshing.

344
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,109
I mean,
that doesn't sound safe for you, either.

345
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:20,992
I don't even know how much
time I can give her.

346
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:22,967
No problem. She's very low-maintenance.

347
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:24,885
Just set her up at a table
and she'll be fine.

348
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,763
If there's a table,
because some of the tables are reserved.

349
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:32,853
I've got my regulars, you know?
They want their tables,
so there may not be room.

350
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:34,540
She's little. You'll find room.

351
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:41,395
You know, Anna, actually I don't
know if tomorrow is gonna
be good at all for anything.

352
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:43,822
I didn't realize how busy I was.

353
00:14:43,911 --> 00:14:46,867
Factor in all the people swooshing
and the grease swooshing.

354
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:48,366
- Luke, no.
- No what?

355
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:49,694
It doesn't work that way.

356
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:50,469
What do you mean?

357
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:52,401
Look, I don't know what the problem is here.

358
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:53,288
What are you talking about?

359
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:56,250
You say you're available one minute,
and the next minute you're not?

360
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,689
- I told you, I was just--
- It's not cool, Luke.

361
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:00,138
It's not happening this way.

362
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:01,977
What way? It's just a bad time.

363
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:04,970
There's no great time to be a parent, Luke,
you just are one.

364
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:09,350
And if you're gonna make plans with my kid
and get her hopes up and then cancel,

365
00:15:09,446 --> 00:15:10,737
then our deal is canceled.

366
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:11,623
Anna, no.

367
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:13,394
Yes, that's it. That's how it works.

368
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:15,301
You're either all-in or you're all-out.

369
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:17,375
We didn't ask for this. You did.

370
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,119
You wanted contact, a relationship, and now--

371
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:22,944
Okay, okay, I hear you.
Have her come to the diner tomorrow.

372
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,406
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

373
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:27,629
I was just overthinking all of this.
I'll see her tomorrow.

374
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:29,323
Okay, she will be there.

375
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,274
Good. Thanks. It'll be good.

376
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:32,394
It better be.

377
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,416
Bye, Luke.

378
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:34,902
Bye.

379
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:40,100
She's starting to go through trash cans.
It's creepy.

380
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:42,422
That's a privacy violation, for god's sake.

381
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:43,350
What's she looking for?

382
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,109
Uh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

383
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:46,081
Hi, guys.

384
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:47,897
Hey, Rory.

385
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:49,362
Did I interrupt something?

386
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,793
No, no, nothing much. Just hangin'.

387
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:52,810
What's going on?

388
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,423
Nothing. Just enjoying a tipple.

389
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:59,774
So all the senior staffers from the Yale
Daily News are simultaneously
enjoying a tipple?

390
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:00,562
Tell her.

391
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:01,016
No.

392
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:02,015
Tell her!

393
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:02,881
Tell me what?

394
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,381
This is a war council.

395
00:16:05,473 --> 00:16:06,067
About what?

396
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,366
About kaiser Geller and her reign of terror.

397
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:09,703
The paper is going to crap.

398
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,739
It's unreadable.

399
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:13,283
She rewrites your stuff,
then rewrites her rewrites.

400
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:16,607
And to add insult to injury,
the copy gets worse every time.

401
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:18,517
She used to be good, right?

402
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:19,882
Wasn't Paris good at one point?

403
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:20,957
Before she was editor.

404
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,150
Now she's Augusto Pinochet in a pantsuit.

405
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:25,145
Yeah, what's up with those pantsuits?

406
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:27,654
We're seriously considering
howell raines-ing her.

407
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:28,812
You want to force her out?

408
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:29,952
She's out of control.

409
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:30,899
And you have the authority?

410
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:31,627
We're the board.

411
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:33,257
And the board has the authority.

412
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:35,931
I'm a senior staffer, too.
Why wasn't I asked to be here tonight?

413
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:37,183
You're in Paris' pocket.

414
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:38,876
I am not in Paris' pocket.

415
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:39,678
You're friends.

416
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:42,236
Best friends, right?
That's what Paris is always saying.

417
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,469
And you guys live together.
It didn't seem appropriate.

418
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,701
Okay, let me set the record straight.

419
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:48,771
I'm devoted to the paper, okay?

420
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:50,815
Personal feelings cannot get
in the way of things.

421
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:52,942
Paris and I are not best friends.

422
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:54,978
We're friends for the most part,

423
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:58,092
and I'm not immune to being driven
crazy by her, believe me.

424
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,328
Oh, we believe you.

425
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:00,514
I'm getting crow's-feet.

426
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:03,335
I'm sorry, but Paris Geller is not
going to give me crow's-feet.

427
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,593
So you do acknowledge a problem here?

428
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:06,746
I just did, A.K.

429
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,970
Where's the trust, dude?

430
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,620
We just want to do this right.

431
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,082
Well, then, let's talk and maybe set
the howell raines-ing aside for now.

432
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:15,266
Let's see if we can fix things
before we blow them up.

433
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:16,616
Fine. Sit.

434
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,499
But allow us our cathartic purging.

435
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:19,686
Purge away.

436
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:23,603
Oh, but first would anyone like
a refreshing coffee beverage?

437
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:25,004
I have Ben till 9:00.

438
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:26,907
I'll have a decaf latte.

439
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:27,611
Same here.

440
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:28,678
Can he do mocha latte?

441
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,332
He does a great mocha latte.

442
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:31,714
I'll have a mocha latte.

443
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,353
Uhh! Sorry.

444
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:39,041
Taylor?

445
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:42,208
What are you doing back?
I thought you were stranded at your sister's.

446
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:43,561
Lorelai, please.

447
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,805
Weird time for line dancing.

448
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:45,924
Fine.

449
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:49,442
Okay, I'm back. I got lucky last night
and caught a plane out of Maine.

450
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,634
Even with the rain in Spain?

451
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,104
Will you be serious for second?

452
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:53,169
What's with the sweats?

453
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,826
I'm incognito. Don't you see?

454
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:55,880
With the carnival coming up,

455
00:17:55,988 --> 00:18:00,351
this is my Huckleberry Finn opportunity
to observe things invisibly.

456
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:02,984
You know,
I'm not gonna be around forever, Lorelai.

457
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,364
Oh, Taylor, are you sick?

458
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:05,748
No, just mortal.

459
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,641
And eventually someone-- maybe Kirk--

460
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:12,001
is going to have to take over the many
delicate tasks I perform for this town--

461
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:15,567
the streetlamp illumination monitoring,
the lawn-height measuring.

462
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:16,799
Now I'm just getting sad.

463
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,024
Please keep my secret.

464
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:19,061
Mum's the word.

465
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:20,223
Well, I should go.

466
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,259
Back to 8 mile?

467
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:22,286
- What?
- Nothing.

468
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:23,251
Ooh, behind you.

469
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:33,337
Hey, Zach. You helping out?

470
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:34,869
Got to keep body and soul together.

471
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,771
Well, this is space 18 and that's my booth,
so we're a team.

472
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:39,990
We should get uniforms.

473
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:40,828
You okay?

474
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:43,917
Yeah, I'm great. I lost my girlfriend,
my band's broken up,

475
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:47,698
my best friend won't speak to me, and I'm
reduced to working as a $5-an-hour carny.

476
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,409
Bob Dylan should write a song about me.

477
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:50,719
I'm sorry about you and Lane.

478
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,555
Yeah, well...

479
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:54,595
But you'll get through this rough
patch and life will move on.

480
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:56,755
Trust me. It's human nature to move on.

481
00:18:56,855 --> 00:18:57,469
What?

482
00:18:57,556 --> 00:18:59,392
- What what?
- Are you saying Lane's moved on?

483
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:00,775
Have you seen her with someone else?

484
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:03,725
No, I'm just saying people have
the ability to move on.

485
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:05,852
Oh, my god, god, god.

486
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,275
I got to go take a break.

487
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,927
Okay. Hope I cheered you up some.

488
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:12,522
Kirk? Kirk.

489
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:13,418
Yes, Lorelai?

490
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:16,203
Why are you putting the exact same
booth right next to my booth?

491
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:19,503
Well, frankly, I have my doubts about your
dog's ability to predict the future.

492
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:20,276
You have your doubts?

493
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,956
Yeah, and in order to satisfy our guests,

494
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:25,252
I'm hedging our bets by putting
the real thing next door

495
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:27,203
so that no one walks away bamboozled.

496
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:28,958
Kirk, there is no real thing. It's all fake.

497
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:31,682
Those tarot cards are not real.
My dog cannot predict the future.

498
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:32,484
So you admit it?

499
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,743
I was never hiding it.

500
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:34,485
That's fraud.

501
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:35,783
It's a doggy swami.

502
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:37,732
My girlfriend says tarot cards are real.

503
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:41,128
Well, I like your girlfriend,
but the cards are no more real than my dog.

504
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:45,912
I got to take this,
but I would like it if you would move the--

505
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,206
Kirk? Kirk?!

506
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:48,160
No, it's me.

507
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:51,226
No, I know it's you.
I just was getting frustrated with Kirk.

508
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:52,401
What else is new?

509
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:56,895
So, um... I was wondering what
your time was like today.

510
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:57,929
My time?

511
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:00,344
Because there's something
I need to run past you.

512
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:01,439
Oh, I have a minute now.

513
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:03,558
I'd like to discuss it in person.

514
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,179
Oh, could it wait till tonight?
'Cause I have the syrup council in town

515
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,171
and they've got a conference and a meal

516
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:12,074
and Josh is out sick and Jamie's out sick
and I just barely got away to come here

517
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:15,111
and get in an argument with Kirk
about what's more legitimate--

518
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:18,010
tarot cards or a fortune-telling dog.

519
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,075
So you're not coming by the diner?

520
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:22,765
Not today, but I'm totally yours tonight.
Is that okay?

521
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:26,556
Uh, sure. So you definitely won't
be coming by the diner today?

522
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:28,009
Not today, sorry.

523
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,501
No, it's okay. Just if you were coming by,
I wanted to know.

524
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:31,690
And now I know you're not.

525
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,297
Right.

526
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:35,425
Okay, so give Kirk hell and I
guess I'll see you tonight.

527
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:36,900
Okay, see you tonight.

528
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:40,928
Hey, Zach, did you see where Kirk went?

529
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:41,817
Thataway.

530
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:49,396
Wonderful. Well, keep warm and
tell Lane I'll see her later.

531
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:50,929
All right. Bye now.

532
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:04,620
April, get in here.

533
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,459
Bye, now.

534
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:08,864
What are you doing talking to him?

535
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,863
He asked about my bike.

536
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:12,431
You don't talk to him. You don't know him.
He could be a strangler.

537
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,325
He seemed to know you.

538
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:15,776
Of course. That's Jake.
I've known him 15 years.

539
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,005
You've known a strangler for 15 years?

540
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:18,403
He's not a strangler.

541
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,351
Then why can't I talk to him?

542
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:22,288
Because you didn't know that.
Don't trust anyone, okay?

543
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:23,554
Anyone.

544
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:25,774
Okay, then I should go lock my bike.

545
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:26,914
No, you don't have to lock it.

546
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:28,232
You just said I can't trust anyone.

547
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:30,340
You don't have to lock your bike.
This is a safe town.

548
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:31,660
Well, I'm confused.

549
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,737
So, here it is.

550
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:35,806
I know. We met here.

551
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:40,165
Right, right.
So, what do you want to do-- sit and color?

552
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:41,125
Color?

553
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:43,390
Wow.

554
00:21:43,574 --> 00:21:46,812
I haven't colored in six or seven years,

555
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:48,501
but that takes me back.

556
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:49,788
Coloring. Wow.

557
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:51,746
Okay, so you don't color.

558
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:52,565
Did you bring a book?

559
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:53,883
I don't really feel like reading.

560
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:57,431
Well, I don't really have
any toys or anything.

561
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:59,225
Your salt and pepper shakers
look a little low.

562
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:01,453
Yes, they are. People salt stuff too much.

563
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:02,326
Can I refill them?

564
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,797
You want to refill the salt shakers?

565
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:05,551
And the pepper. And possibly the sugar.

566
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:06,980
We'll see how the salt and pepper goes.

567
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:09,898
Oh, well, okay. Refill the salt and pepper?

568
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,552
Whatever. I'll get the boxes.

569
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:12,949
- Great.
- Great.

570
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,055
Coloring.

571
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:29,174
Well, it may surprise some of you, but that's
a syrup derived from a black maple.

572
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,930
Yes, it's sweeter than the first two,
but it's a natural sweetness
with a hint of orange.

573
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,393
Very unusual and very good.

574
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:38,262
Let's move on to number four, shall we?

575
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:41,047
And number four is another little surprise.

576
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:45,078
Ugh, gives my skin that weird, tingly feel
like something's bubbling underneath it.

577
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:48,492
It makes the root of my tongue feel like
it's retracting back into my throat.

578
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:52,044
What don't they pour it on something-- a
waffle, a pancake?

579
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:54,200
So, let's go ahead and taste number four,
shall we?

580
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:55,329
Then we'll talk.

581
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:56,451
Ew!

582
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,650
Ew, drinking straight syrup!

583
00:22:58,755 --> 00:22:59,864
You don't have to watch this.

584
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:01,117
It's hard not to.

585
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:03,177
A bit of a tobacco taste to it

586
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:04,529
and a bit of marshmallow.

587
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:08,099
Oh, good, now I can't smoke a cigar
or eat a marshmallow again.

588
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:09,939
How does one discover a talent for this?

589
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:12,376
Remember, for anyone who wants one,

590
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:13,993
we have spit buckets.

591
00:23:14,364 --> 00:23:14,996
That's it.

592
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:15,869
See ya.

593
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:21,281
Hi.

594
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:22,703
Hello.

595
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,875
I was gonna call you, but then I figured
you wouldn't take the call.

596
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:29,211
Yeah, you figured right.

597
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,354
I just need a minute.

598
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:34,254
I can't fathom what a minute of
my time is gonna do for you.

599
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:37,005
Just a minute, please, then I am gone.

600
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:37,867
Okay.

601
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,686
Look, I know I'm not your favorite
person in the world.

602
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:43,121
No, you're definitely low on the list,

603
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:46,164
right above the guy who thought
up smallpox blankets.

604
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,729
Well, in my defense,
I think I'm a notch higher than that.

605
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,816
You're not exactly in a position
to comment on that, are you?

606
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:51,347
No.

607
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:54,561
No. In fact, let's take inventory
of all the delightful things

608
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:57,077
that have happened since you waltzed
into my daughter's life.

609
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,759
She was arrested, convicted.
She's on probation.

610
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:02,296
She'll have a criminal record unless
we can get it expunged.

611
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:04,823
She dropped out of school,
moved out of my house.

612
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:08,223
She didn't speak to me for 5 months, 3 weeks,
and 16 days.

613
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,737
No, wait a minute. Come to think of it,
you are my favorite person.

614
00:24:11,822 --> 00:24:14,514
Okay, I can defend myself on one
or two of those points as well.

615
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,292
No, you can't. Why are you here?

616
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:19,417
I miss her, okay? I made a mistake
and I'm trying to rectify it.

617
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:21,488
But nothing is working. She won't talk to me.

618
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:22,559
Can you blame her?

619
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:26,190
No, I'm doing everything
I can-- flowers, gifts.

620
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:27,676
All your old standbys, huh?

621
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,504
Books, coffee cart.
I'm trying to show her how I feel.

622
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,949
And it sounds like she's trying
to show you how she feels.

623
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:35,620
Look, I figured this was
a suicide mission, okay?

624
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:38,000
It's probably something you and Rory
will laugh about for years to come.

625
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:40,055
But I'm not giving up until
I exhaust all my options,

626
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,400
and asking for your help is one of them.

627
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:43,299
Really?

628
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:44,117
Yes.

629
00:24:44,204 --> 00:24:47,974
You're seriously here to ask
for my help with Rory?

630
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:48,954
This is not a joke?

631
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:50,401
I'm going for broke here.

632
00:24:50,508 --> 00:24:51,378
Well...

633
00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:55,190
you got moxie, my friend, I'll give you that.

634
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,476
I think I get it from my dad.

635
00:24:56,589 --> 00:24:57,593
I hate your dad.

636
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:58,505
Me too.

637
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:00,287
See? We have things in common, you and me.

638
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:01,957
Maybe this isn't so crazy.

639
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:15,423
Oh, hi.

640
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:16,425
Hello there.

641
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,692
What are you doing?

642
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,791
- Chores.
- Yeah, I see.

643
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,606
- Are you a strangler?
- No.

644
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:22,651
Just checking.

645
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,300
Rice-- that's the key. Prevents clumping.

646
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:26,831
Oh, yeah. I hate clumpy salt.

647
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:27,833
That's universal.

648
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:29,771
So, who do you belong to-- Caesar?

649
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:30,344
Who?

650
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:31,738
You're not Caesar's?

651
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,225
Not according to the lab results.

652
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:34,586
How'd you land the gig?

653
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:37,645
My father owns the place. The diner,
at least. Not sure about the land.

654
00:25:37,758 --> 00:25:38,672
Your father?

655
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:40,014
My biological father.

656
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:41,690
Not really sure what to call him.
It's kind of new.

657
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:43,743
Not the biological part. That was years ago.

658
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:45,516
I wonder if brown rice would work, too.

659
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:47,905
Brown might be more decorative
or it might backfire.

660
00:25:47,994 --> 00:25:49,564
People might think there
are bugs in the salt.

661
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,424
I should put some brown rice
in one of the shakers

662
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,753
and use it as a control group
against the other ones.

663
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:56,591
I thought you couldn't get away.

664
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:57,621
I got away.

665
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,833
She said she wasn't a strangler.

666
00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:01,760
Uh, you want to go outside?

667
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:05,900
April, I'll be right back, okay?

668
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:06,990
Okay.

669
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,664
- So she's--
- Yeah.

670
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:20,906
- Wow.
- I know.

671
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:23,182
- That's...
- My daughter.

672
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,206
I don't believe it.

673
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:27,066
I still have trouble believing it.

674
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:29,291
- You have a--
- Yeah.

675
00:26:29,406 --> 00:26:30,056
Right.

676
00:26:30,185 --> 00:26:32,104
- What is she-- 12?
- Yeah, 12.

677
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:34,552
12 years. 12 years.

678
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:35,807
This is for sure?

679
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,309
It's for sure.

680
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:38,951
When did you find out?

681
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,740
- I just found out.
- Just?

682
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:44,788
When just?
She's in there filling salt shakers.
It doesn't feel that new to me.

683
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:46,496
Two months ago.

684
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:47,847
Two months?!

685
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:50,278
That's a hell of a long time
to go without telling me.

686
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:52,195
I know. I should've told you.

687
00:26:53,464 --> 00:26:54,429
She's cute.

688
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:57,519
Lorelai, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I'm sorry.

689
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,242
It's all just a blur of stuff happening.

690
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,216
She just came into the diner two months ago,
no warning,

691
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,098
talking about a science fair
and how I may be her father.

692
00:27:06,198 --> 00:27:09,144
She pulled my hair out and DNA-tested it.

693
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:11,688
Then I wanted to forget the whole thing,

694
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:15,127
but I went to the fair and
found out the truth.

695
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:17,493
We were at the park,
and she wanted to come here.

696
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:23,175
I called you today,
wanting a moment to talk about it,
but you were busy, and...

697
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,423
so I put it off again. And here we are.

698
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:28,714
Here we are.

699
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:31,614
It's stupid. I'm stupid.

700
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:36,345
Look, I need to digest this and
you have to get back inside,

701
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:39,865
so I'm just gonna go someplace
where I can digest this

702
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:41,873
and we'll just talk more later, okay?

703
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:43,590
Sure. Whenever you want.

704
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:44,708
Okay.

705
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:46,416
I'm sorry.

706
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,679
"What's up with the caps," she asked,
knowing it's probably not good.

707
00:28:07,774 --> 00:28:10,421
It's Paris. She's having trouble
remembering everyone's names.

708
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:12,994
Or as she puts it, she has more important
things to do with her brain.

709
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:13,764
Oh, jeez.

710
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:16,666
Plus some of us have confused the issue
by having the same first name--

711
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,328
the three Johns,
the two Marthas-- so she's issued numbers.

712
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:20,128
Oh, jeez.

713
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:21,468
Martinet at 3:00.

714
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:24,753
Nice job on bienecki map theft article,
number 17.

715
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:25,492
Thanks, Paris.

716
00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:27,902
23 and 80, I need your stuff by 5:00.

717
00:28:27,994 --> 00:28:29,963
Ah, Rory-- new system.

718
00:28:30,063 --> 00:28:30,786
Here's your number.

719
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,654
Paris, you know me.
I don't need a number and I'm the only Rory.

720
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,101
But you don't want me to play favorites,
do you? We talked about this.

721
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,141
So we all have numbers?

722
00:28:37,244 --> 00:28:39,453
Including me. I'm number one.
Don't need a cap for that.

723
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:41,475
If they can't remember the number one,
they shouldn't be here.

724
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,209
Hey, can we talk in a little
more private place?

725
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,070
Sure.

726
00:28:44,543 --> 00:28:47,068
If you're looking for 1 and 2,
we'll be in the hallway.

727
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:51,383
Paris, the atmosphere here,
it's getting a little toxic.

728
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:51,851
What?

729
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:54,500
Everyone here is very stressed.
The greaseboard, the hats.

730
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:55,820
I haven't heard any complaints.

731
00:28:55,923 --> 00:28:58,078
That's because people are
afraid to approach you.

732
00:28:58,178 --> 00:29:00,163
You rewrite everything they do.
You don't delegate.

733
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:00,948
That's not true.

734
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:05,012
Look, the staff and I had a little talk
yesterday. It was very impromptu.

735
00:29:05,104 --> 00:29:08,189
I won't get into the hairy details,
but it would really help

736
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:10,049
if you could relieve some
of the pressure here.

737
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,148
They think it's that bad?

738
00:29:11,246 --> 00:29:13,878
You've taken away the magnets that indicate
people are in the bathroom,

739
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:15,242
so now they're afraid to go.

740
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,636
Well, they were going too much.

741
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:18,378
People are getting very nervous here.

742
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:21,735
Yeah, I see.

743
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,135
I'll go talk to them.

744
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:24,572
Thanks for bringing it to my attention.

745
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:25,570
You're welcome.

746
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:30,752
Where's 73 and 32?

747
00:29:31,676 --> 00:29:35,955
People, Rory Gilmore has just
informed me of the meeting

748
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:38,984
held behind my back concerning
my stewardship of the paper.

749
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:39,929
Oh, Paris.

750
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:40,971
Am I tough?

751
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,651
You're damn right I'm tough.

752
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:45,856
You think it's going to be any
easier entering the work force

753
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:50,017
with every newspaper in the country
cutting back on staff?

754
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:56,411
Also, any chance that you'd attempt the same
sort of flaccid coup if I were a man?

755
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,703
I think not.

756
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:59,613
You're trying to howell raines me?

757
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,611
Well, forget it.

758
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:04,175
Suck it up and get to work!
Otherwise there's the door.

759
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:23,106
I come bearing gifts.

760
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,357
I have to unlock the door.

761
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:27,329
You can't say no to these. I know you.
It's biologically impossible.

762
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,244
Oh, yeah?

763
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:29,198
No.

764
00:30:30,448 --> 00:30:32,008
That seems very cumbersome.

765
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:33,280
You get used to it.

766
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:34,840
You get the coffee cart?

767
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:36,979
You really think we're gonna chitchat?

768
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:38,197
I just wanted to know.

769
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,037
Yeah, I got it.

770
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:42,904
And the flowers and the books and
the candles and the fruit.

771
00:30:42,994 --> 00:30:45,666
What's next on the list-- a marching band?

772
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:47,403
A parrot who says "I'm sorry"?

773
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:49,045
- You have to go.
- Wait.

774
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:50,942
What's that-- a subpoena?

775
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:52,297
It's a note from your mother.

776
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:53,208
You're kidding.

777
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:56,237
Check out the handwriting,
Dragonfly stationery.

778
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,825
Can we get out of the hallway?

779
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:06,655
I went to see her at her inn.
We talked a little. It was a tad humiliating.

780
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:10,751
She told me to wait and she came back with
this. She said to give it to you.

781
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:12,057
What's it say?

782
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:13,747
I was instructed not to read it.

783
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:16,666
She even signed the seal on
the envelope to make sure.

784
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:19,111
You have no idea what this says?

785
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:20,110
None.

786
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,797
What's it say?

787
00:31:26,939 --> 00:31:27,858
Shh.

788
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:30,380
What's it say?

789
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,433
Shh!

790
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,272
What does it say?

791
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,358
Shh!

792
00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:37,722
Come on, ace, you're laughing.
Is that good or bad?

793
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,610
Yep.

794
00:31:41,412 --> 00:31:42,266
Yep.

795
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:46,761
Just give me some indication whether it's
good or bad. Something, anything.

796
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,957
Okay, fine. Just tell me. Is there anything
in there about giving me a second chance?

797
00:31:52,066 --> 00:31:53,054
I'd have to reread it.

798
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:54,663
Please don't do that, ace, come on.

799
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:56,891
Come out with me. Let me make it up to you.

800
00:31:58,354 --> 00:31:59,463
Maybe dinner.

801
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:00,299
When?

802
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:01,510
I'll have to check my schedule.

803
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,451
Check it.

804
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:03,743
I can't do it right now.

805
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:04,830
So?

806
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:06,620
- I'll call you.
- Good enough.

807
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:08,237
Good enough. Promise you'll call?

808
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:09,241
Leave the doughnuts.

809
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,671
Margaret, I'm home.

810
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:23,624
Kitchen.

811
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:24,956
And I come bearing gifts.

812
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:25,942
Laundry galore.

813
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:29,124
Oh, and I've got some candles
and some fancy fruit, too.

814
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:33,780
I don't know who Harry and David are,
but they sure do know how to grow a pear.

815
00:32:33,928 --> 00:32:38,439
So, your letter-- oh, my god.
It was brilliant.

816
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,834
It has got to be anthologized.
I'm telling you.

817
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:45,672
And he definitely did not read it because
he looked flummoxed-- flummoxed!--

818
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,865
The whole time I was reading it,
and I didn't tell him a thing about it.

819
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,242
That's what he gets.

820
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,639
So, come on.
I want to hear all about his visit with you.

821
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:54,660
Mom?

822
00:32:56,115 --> 00:32:57,773
Luke has a daughter.

823
00:32:58,158 --> 00:33:00,835
And we'll talk about the letter later. What?

824
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,503
He has a 12-year-old daughter.
I met her today.

825
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,603
I didn't formally meet her,
but I saw her and I talked to her.

826
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:06,101
What?

827
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:09,737
He has a daughter with some woman.
We didn't get to that-- the big who--

828
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,243
but he's known for two months.

829
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:11,882
Two months?

830
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,071
- A daughter.
- A daughter.

831
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:14,683
What does this say about our relationship?

832
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:15,257
What do you mean?

833
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:17,531
He waited two months to tell me.

834
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:19,293
Did he say why he waited?

835
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,431
Yes, he said he was confused, and I get that.

836
00:33:21,514 --> 00:33:24,824
I mean, I'm confused, but what does it
mean that he kept a secret like this?

837
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:27,148
What does it say about him?
What does it say about me?

838
00:33:27,232 --> 00:33:28,964
Doesn't he trust me? Why doesn't he trust me?

839
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:31,142
He trusts you, mom. He's a guy.

840
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:32,843
Sometimes guys are really dumb.

841
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:34,411
- She's cute.
- She is?

842
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,824
Yeah, she seems smart like you.
What is it with the next generation?

843
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,300
You're all smarter than the rest of us.

844
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:39,274
Not necessarily.

845
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:41,227
- I'm freaking out.
- I don't blame you.

846
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:44,468
What else is he hiding? I mean, how can
you really know that you know somebody?

847
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:45,539
I don't think you can.

848
00:33:45,635 --> 00:33:48,082
Every relationship is just a big,
honkin' leap of faith.

849
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:49,149
Yeah, I guess.

850
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,547
You didn't ask about the mother?

851
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:52,947
I just ran off.
I couldn't wrap my mind around it.

852
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:56,264
Well, Luke must be freaked out double
what you're freaked out, you know--

853
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:59,474
Mr. Responsibility?
He must've put his baseball cap on backwards.

854
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:00,019
Yeah.

855
00:34:00,114 --> 00:34:01,191
I'm sure he panicked.

856
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:04,435
I'm sure his not telling you says
nothing about your relationship.

857
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:06,800
Maybe this is a cheesy perspective
to offer you,

858
00:34:06,902 --> 00:34:10,321
but Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale went
through the same sort of situation.

859
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:12,828
He found out he had a kid that
he didn't know about,

860
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:14,932
but they made it work... as far as I know.

861
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:15,704
Meaning?

862
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,936
If they can, you can.

863
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:18,004
Really?

864
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:19,810
They're people. You're people.

865
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:21,884
I mean, you don't sing and neither does Luke.

866
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:25,563
But really, neither do Gwen or Gavin,
but they're still together... I think.

867
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,105
I haven't read anything to the contrary.

868
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:28,059
I guess.

869
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:29,683
You and Luke just need to talk some more.

870
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:32,396
Yeah.
Maybe I'll tell Luke about Gwen and Gavin.

871
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,863
I mean, if there's any people whose lives
Luke would relate to, it's Gwen and Gavin.

872
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:08,630
They only cost 50 cents?

873
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:10,965
Yeah, how lame would it be to go to
the trouble of counterfeiting?

874
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,361
No mind games.

875
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:14,081
They're legit.

876
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:15,763
Another crime thwarted.

877
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:17,118
Good job, Columbo.

878
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:24,687
Guten tag, there. I would like-- what
you call them?-- A hot dog.

879
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:25,580
Coming up.

880
00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:31,359
Ja.

881
00:35:31,544 --> 00:35:35,568
Oh, und we are having cold
weather this year, nein?

882
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:43,253
- It's a smashing concept.
- And Kirk was doubtful.

883
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,838
- We've already raked in $18.
- And the night is young.

884
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:47,464
Come on, doggy swami, break's over.

885
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,538
He is liking his hat.

886
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:50,856
Well, it's very flattering.

887
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:54,364
You know, I can man this myself if
you don't feel like being here.

888
00:35:54,447 --> 00:35:55,642
No, it's good for me.

889
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:58,936
Nothing is a better distraction than
a dog in a turban, telling fortunes.

890
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,532
It's a cliché for a reason.

891
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,205
Come see the amazing doggy swami.

892
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:05,907
- Discover your future...
- If you dare.

893
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,305
- It's silly.
- And fun.

894
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:10,679
And real. Very, very real.

895
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:16,177
Congratulations. Nice job. Want to play?
It's only a dollar.

896
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:17,111
Sure.

897
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,267
Winner! We have a winner!

898
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,224
Really? That's it?

899
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:25,054
That's it. Here's your prize.

900
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:27,726
"Hell is waiting for you, sinner."

901
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:28,792
Enjoy.

902
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:36,212
Please, step up and play "toss the
sybarite into the hellfires."

903
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,256
Everybody's a winner!

904
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:40,527
I'm gonna go take a little walk,
check out the competition.

905
00:36:40,621 --> 00:36:42,820
Just don't let my mother see you
play anything too decadent.

906
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:44,163
I'll be back in a bit.

907
00:36:55,475 --> 00:37:00,397
Ahh! Oui! Look at those games.

908
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:04,444
It is so marvelous that I am here to see it.

909
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,583
What a great country.

910
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:08,930
J'adore.

911
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:11,595
Taylor finally flipped his lid.

912
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:15,267
Yeah, poor Morey couldn't make it.

913
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,432
I made him drink 30 bottles of coke
last night for the game here,

914
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:20,098
so he's still throwing up.

915
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,773
And then I ended up not using 'em.
Shame, huh?

916
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:24,616
But I'll tell him you said "hi."

917
00:37:24,805 --> 00:37:26,751
Hey, want to throw some balls?

918
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,280
Just don't laugh too hard at me.

919
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,330
Never, never. Come on up here.

920
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,726
- Give me some balls.
- Fresh balls coming up.

921
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:43,079
Yeah!

922
00:37:43,187 --> 00:37:44,598
Watch it,
honey-- it could bounce off the back

923
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,665
and hit the girls manning the dime toss.

924
00:37:46,985 --> 00:37:48,525
There you go. You're getting the hang of it.

925
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,232
Yeah, cute little throw.

926
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:51,738
- Excuse me?
- Pretty boy says what?

927
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,319
What?

928
00:37:53,684 --> 00:37:56,967
Jeez, Zach,
what's with being all goose gossage?

929
00:37:57,634 --> 00:37:59,647
Zach, those aren't your bottles!

930
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:01,035
Yeah!

931
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:03,833
Yeah! Welcome to the S.H., Bitch!

932
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:04,770
What's your problem?

933
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:05,868
I don't got a problem, friend.

934
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,860
My problem is I got no more
bottles to knock down.

935
00:38:07,974 --> 00:38:09,165
Who do I give the prize to?

936
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,137
Give it to Asian George Clooney over here.

937
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:12,149
I'm outtie.

938
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:17,067
So, I-I-I got Smurfs and dirty pasta.

939
00:38:19,272 --> 00:38:20,299
What'd you just put in there?

940
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,169
Nothing, lady.

941
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:22,512
You stuck something in the cider.

942
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:23,616
I did not.

943
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:26,911
Although if I did, it would be a thermometer
and it might indicate

944
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,650
that you are on the border of
underheating your cider.

945
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:30,370
Get away from me.

946
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:30,945
Gladly!

947
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,072
Now. Right now.

948
00:38:35,361 --> 00:38:36,665
- Winner!
- But I missed.

949
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:38,068
Everybody's a winner.

950
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:41,217
Mrs. Kim, I need a word with you.

951
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:42,195
I'm busy.

952
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:44,301
You couldn't wait to put her on
the market again, could you?

953
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:45,197
What are you talking about?

954
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:47,816
Who else? Lane!
We only broke up a few weeks ago.

955
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,324
What-- you got her engaged already?

956
00:38:49,415 --> 00:38:50,929
- Engaged to who?
- To who?

957
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:54,634
The Korean Brad Pitt guy there with the
Italian loafers and super white teeth--

958
00:38:54,722 --> 00:38:55,772
he's hanging all over her.

959
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,337
- You mean her uncle?
- What?

960
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:58,466
Joe-- he's her uncle.

961
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,492
That can't be her uncle. Uncles are old.

962
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:02,756
My mother had me, waited long time,
then had him.

963
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:04,255
Joe is my brother.

964
00:39:04,351 --> 00:39:06,795
Whoa, okay. Oops.

965
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:08,207
Yes, "oops."

966
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,092
But just to be clear here,
she's not hot on her uncle?

967
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:14,496
She's not. Got it. Well, sorry.

968
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:15,753
Wait!

969
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,308
You accuse me of something?

970
00:39:17,744 --> 00:39:19,284
We settle this now.

971
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:20,422
All right.

972
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:23,858
I am not going to get in your way.

973
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:25,765
Okay.

974
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:31,925
- Ready?
- Ready.

975
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,163
Spin the wheel.

976
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,089
The swami has chosen!

977
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:38,856
- Ready?
- This is exciting.

978
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:42,400
"You will sing songs of gemstones."

979
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:43,908
Of gemstones!

980
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:45,329
How do you sing songs of gemstones?

981
00:39:45,421 --> 00:39:48,084
I was a little tired when I wrote this one.
Sorry. You want to pick another one?

982
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:49,266
Swami do-overs are allowed.

983
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,981
No, I'll stick with this one.
It's got an air of mystery.

984
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:54,071
Hey, Luke,
want swami doggy to read your fortune?

985
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:55,716
Maybe some other time.

986
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:56,698
- Hey.
- Hey.

987
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:57,904
Can we walk a little bit?

988
00:39:58,014 --> 00:39:58,714
Yeah.

989
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,414
I've got to apologize again.
I should've told you immediately.

990
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:08,615
I was just so confused. It's no excuse,
but that's the excuse.

991
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:10,070
I know. I get it.

992
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:12,176
Nothing can prepare you for this one.

993
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,556
I just didn't know how to tell you.
I'm bad with things.

994
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:16,891
No, Luke.

995
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:21,387
Listen, it's weird, you know,
but we can make it work.

996
00:40:21,492 --> 00:40:24,605
I mean, she's there. April is there.

997
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,539
Luckily you're with a woman
who's raised a daughter

998
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,082
and knows some of the ins and outs.

999
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:31,563
- I can help.
- I know you can.

1000
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:35,913
I guess it's just-- it's just
all so much right now.

1001
00:40:36,014 --> 00:40:37,293
I've been dizzy for weeks.

1002
00:40:37,383 --> 00:40:38,036
Yeah, I know.

1003
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:39,352
It felt like something was up.

1004
00:40:39,455 --> 00:40:40,835
All too much, you know?

1005
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,201
What all-- everything?

1006
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,500
Well, I've got a kid. She's here-- you know,
June 3rd.

1007
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,927
What about June 3rd?

1008
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,580
It's just so soon.

1009
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:52,052
It's still months away.

1010
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:55,226
Well, it feels close. It's everything,
you know?

1011
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,767
It's all piling up.
It's all happening so fast.

1012
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:01,846
Well, if it's all happening too fast,
we can just postpone.

1013
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:03,270
Postpone the wedding?

1014
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,294
Yeah, I mean, it's not set in stone.

1015
00:41:06,406 --> 00:41:09,517
It just happened to work out
for a date that soon.

1016
00:41:09,627 --> 00:41:11,739
I don't want you going into this
all jumbled up, you know?

1017
00:41:11,864 --> 00:41:14,195
And that would be okay with you?

1018
00:41:14,331 --> 00:41:15,480
Sure.

1019
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:20,580
Well, that'll help.
Yeah, that'll really help.

1020
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:23,344
That'll give me time to resolve
this other thing.

1021
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,027
Everything will be better later on.

1022
00:41:26,144 --> 00:41:29,673
Well... great. Then it's a done deal.

1023
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:36,555
Think it might be a health-code violation,
kissing this close to the cotton candy booth.

1024
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:37,899
Meet me back at my place later?

1025
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:39,681
Yeah, see you there.
