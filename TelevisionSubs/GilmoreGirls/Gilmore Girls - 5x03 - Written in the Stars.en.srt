1
00:00:17,212 --> 00:00:19,705
Shaken, not stirred, please, Jeeves.
- His name is Robert.

2
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:23,648
I thought every butler's name was Jeeves.
- He's not a butler. He's a valet.

3
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:26,306
So he parks your car?
- No, he does not park my car.

4
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:28,634
He does exactly what you see him doing.
- So he is a bartender.

5
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:31,423
He attends to my needs.
- So he's a geisha.

6
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,109
You'll be quieter once you have a drink, I assume.

7
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:38,985
So, young lady, you're starting your
second year of Yale this week.

8
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:41,036
Yeah, I move into Branford on Monday.

9
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,002
You're going to love Branford College.
That where I lived, you know.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:44,897
I know.

11
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:46,641
It is the oldest of Yale's
residential colleges

12
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,771
They have these Carillon bells that are
enchanting, and it has,

13
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:53,696
what was called by Robert Frost, the most
beautiful college courtyard in America.

14
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:57,151
Well, I'll tell you what, Grandpa – I'll get
settled in, and then we can have lunch there.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,194
Ah, that's a deal

16
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:02,039
You wanted me to remind you that you were
going to bring out the Hungarian cheese, sir.

17
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:03,752
Yes I did. I'll be right back.

18
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:06,765
This is crazy.

19
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:09,324
Well, it depends on your
definition of "crazy. "

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,887
I, for one, found the Mariah Carey phone
messages to her fans just refreshingly imaginative.

21
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,086
We're having drinks in the pool house.
- Yup.

22
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:18,613
The last time I was in the pool house
was the last time I was in the pool.

23
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:19,949
I know. I pushed you in.

24
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,343
So, Grandpa's actually living out here?
- Looks like.

25
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,408
Do you think he's happy?
- I do. I think he's very happy out here

26
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:28,065
with his books and his special friend, Robert.
- Don't be gross.

27
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,391
What? I'm just saying two grown men out
here alone with Hungarian cheese and swim trunks...

28
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:34,256
Oh, jeez.

29
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,766
Don't be so puritanical. After all,
Heather has two mommies.

30
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:42,404
All right, we have cheese, we have drinks.
Do you each have a coaster?

31
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:44,505
Kierkegaard.
- Schopenhauer.

32
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,533
Excellent.

33
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:50,292
Yes?

34
00:01:50,747 --> 00:01:53,257
Dinner is served in the main house.
- I will tell Mr. Gilmore.

35
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:59,743
Dinner is served in the main house.
- But we haven't finished our drinks yet.

36
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:00,948
But the madam is ready now.

37
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:05,446
Well, ladies, it's been a
lovely evening. Until next week...

38
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:07,317
Hold on, Dad.

39
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:09,468
Thank you, Grandpa.

40
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:12,322
Yeah. Thanks for the cheese, Dad. Bye.

41
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,024
Hmm. Soup in 100-degree weather. Cool.

42
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,269
I have the air-conditioning on, Lorelai.
- I like it, Grandma.

43
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:24,270
Oh, my God, the sucking up.
- Stop it.

44
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:28,820
Thank you. It's fennel potato puree with
a touch of chili to give it spice.

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,733
I thought we could go more exotic now
that it's just us giris.

46
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:34,993
If you really want an exotic giris'
night out, Mom, let's hit Baja.

47
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:38,302
So, Rory, tell me, what's new?
- Different room, same reaction.

48
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:42,148
Oh, nothing much.
- Really? Well, what was new 20 minutes ago?

49
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,983
Excuse me?
- What did you talk about with your grandfather?

50
00:02:46,548 --> 00:02:48,779
Oh, well - - I mean, just because
he gets you first in the evening

51
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,849
doesn't mean you get to waste
all the good stories on him.

52
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:53,392
I didn't wa - - So, you just
tell me everything you told him

53
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:56,684
exactly as you told him, leave nothing out.
- Okay. Well, I'm...

54
00:02:58,117 --> 00:03:01,311
moving into Branford College on Monday.
- You know, Robert Frost said that Branford...

55
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,689
has the most beautiful college
courtyard in America.

56
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:05,074
Hmm. You don't say.

57
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:07,210
- You knew that?
- No.

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,789
He told you that?
- No.

59
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:12,100
You've already discussed everything
there is to discuss. You're all talked out.

60
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:13,304
We're not all talked out.

61
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:16,808
He gets you first, talks you out,
and I get two exhausted, empty shells.

62
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:19,935
What do you think you're doing?

63
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:22,640
I needed to get something
out of my study.

64
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:26,700
You are supposed to stay in the
pool house. That is what we agreed on.

65
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:29,566
I am in the pool house.
- Oh, really? Right now?

66
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,273
No, not right now. I told you
I had to get something.

67
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:33,982
Well, you should have called,
made an appointment.

68
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,491
To go into my own study?
- You don't live here anymore, Richard.

69
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,985
What if I was sitting in
the living room stark-naked?

70
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:42,147
You've never been in the living room stark-naked.
You've never been stark-naked.

71
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:44,835
We went skinny-dipping one night,
and you wore an overcoat.

72
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:46,774
The water was freezing!

73
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,545
Crazy.
- You said it, Patsy Cline.

74
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,426
Okay, but think about it.
Why do we need the word "potty"?

75
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,276
Is it really that much harder for a
kid to learn the word "bathroom"?

76
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:51,482
I don't know.

77
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,703
"Timmy, do you have to go potty?" Or
"Timmy, do you have to go to the bathroom?"

78
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:56,764
See? Interchangeable.

79
00:04:57,335 --> 00:04:59,224
Not exactly interchangeable.
- How are they not interchangeable?

80
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:03,118
To go potty is an action. To go to the
bathroom is to go into a specific place.

81
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:04,259
I hate the word "potty. "

82
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:06,103
- Well, what did you teach me to say?
- "Bathroom. "

83
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:07,780
You did?
- Yes, of course.

84
00:05:08,236 --> 00:05:10,535
I'm 2, I come up to you and I say,
"Mommy, Mommy, I have to go to the -" -

85
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,841
The room where legends die.

86
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:13,207
What can I get you?
- A foster home.

87
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,191
You'll thank me one day.
- Hi.

88
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:17,216
I'm working.

89
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,474
Come on. This is the beginning of a
relationship. You're supposed to act stupid.

90
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:23,474
I'll do the chicken dance on my lunch break.
Heading back to school?

91
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,950
Yeah, sophomore year.
- Anything you want - on the house.

92
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:28,070
I can't believe you won't flirt
with me in front of my daughter.

93
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,601
She's gonna think there's
something wrong with me.

94
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,371
Please. I got that confirmation
letter a long time ago.

95
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:35,435
Scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese
and half bacon, half sausage.

96
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:38,628
I'll have the same, and put it on her tab.
- You get your own tab.

97
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:42,213
Oh, thank God you don't have a Latin
accent, or you'd be completely irresistible.

98
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,777
Coffee will be ready in a minute.

99
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,054
Be back in a second.

100
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:54,647
You gestured?
- Those jeans are really working for you.

101
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:56,669
Yeah?
- They're working for me, too.

102
00:05:57,254 --> 00:05:59,095
You're flirting with me.
- Something like that.

103
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:02,810
Finally. Do it some more.
- Your shoes work well with that - shirt.

104
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:06,347
Gee, Carson, thanks.
- That's all I can do right now. People are watching.

105
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:07,568
Okay.

106
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,218
But tonight I will give you my extremely
positive views on other aspects of your being.

107
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:12,782
Tonight?
- Are you free?

108
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,869
Yeah, I'm free.
- Good. 7:30.

109
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:16,923
What are we gonna do?
- I've got some thoughts.

110
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,474
Alright, but no taking me to an art
museum after hours and then to an empty Hollywood bowl

111
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:23,472
where you give me a pair of diamond
earrings that you bought with your college money

112
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:26,047
when all the time you're really in love
with your best friend, the drummer,

113
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:27,384
who's posing as our driver for the evening.

114
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:31,607
- Okay, I'll think of something else.
- So, what do we say?

115
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,239
Say?
- To people, to the town. Do we tell them we're dating?

116
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:38,530
I don't know. Do we?
- I don't know. I guess we could keep it quiet for a while.

117
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:42,637
We could - if that's what you want.
- No, that's not what I want.

118
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,523
Why don't we just play it by ear?
- Yeah, yeah. People will know when they know.

119
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:47,134
Okay, sounds good.
- Okay, so, 7:30?

120
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:49,254
7:30
- Are you gonna watch me walk away?

121
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:51,339
Yeah.
- I'll add a little jaunt to it for you.

122
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,714
What was that all about?
- We were just talking about our date for tonight.

123
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,735
A real date? Finally!
- Yeah, finally.

124
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:03,122
What are you gonna wear?

125
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:06,578
Mmm, glass slippers, a backwards
baseball cap...

126
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:07,523
…and nothing else.
- Exactly.

127
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:11,219
I'm very excited.
- Me too. Hey, have you talked to -

128
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,370
No. - Do you think you're
going to before you -

129
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:15,897
Oh, food. Thank God.
- Hot plates.

130
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:20,703
See? He called me "Hot Plates. " He so likes me.
- Jeez.

131
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,860
The mail must be here.

132
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,381
The Farthingtons' dogs are apoplectic.
Ridiculous choice of animal -

133
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:33,530
a vicious 3-inch ball of hair and a bow
- a ridiculous pink bow for the vicious killers.

134
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:38,272
"Oh, watch out! Cecil Beaton and the Duke
of Windsor are headed straight for my shoes!"

135
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:42,296
Thank you. I'd like some coffee
when you get a chance.

136
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:55,610
Did we ever hear back from Mr. Gilmore
about the Heart Association luncheon?

137
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:58,493
I told his valet about it.
- And what a help that was.

138
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,584
Well, call his valet back and tell him
I need a meeting with Mr. Gilmore this afternoon.

139
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:04,914
Yes, Mrs. Gilmore.
- Thank you.

140
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,192
Oh, shut up!

141
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:11,596
Careful. If you stain that, my grandmother
will hunt you down and kill you.

142
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,713
I wish that I was kidding.
I'll get the door.

143
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,264
Rory!

144
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:21,178
Marty, hi! It's nice to see you!
- So, are you living here?

145
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:23,262
I'm living here.
- That's great. So am I.

146
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,273
Oh, sorry. I have to let these guys in.
So, how was your summer?

147
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:30,465
I met Nicole Richie, and then spent
the next six weeks showering.

148
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:38,286
It should be open.

149
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:41,743
Door's locked.

150
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:46,355
Oh, really? Sorry. I thought that
Paris would be here already.

151
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:54,208
Nice room.

152
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:58,591
I can't believe I beat Paris here.
I mean, normally, she would want to get dibs

153
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:01,817
on the best room first and set up
the furniture exactly the way she wants it.

154
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:05,435
Maybe she's just late.
- Paris is never late.

155
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:13,568
Paris, hey, it's Rory.
- Rory. Hello.

156
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:17,185
I'm in our room, and I was just wondering
how I could have beat you here.

157
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,759
I'll be there later.
- Are you okay? You sound funny.

158
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:21,829
Asher's dead.
What?

159
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:29,780
He died two weeks ago in Oxford.
- Oh. Paris, I'm sorry. How?

160
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,024
Heart attack. It was quick.
- Heart attack?

161
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:34,539
Yes.

162
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,557
Um... it wasn't during, um... was it?

163
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:44,040
No, Rory. This great man was not
brought down by my vagina, okay?

164
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:47,478
Okay. Sorry. I just - that's terrible.

165
00:09:48,113 --> 00:09:50,720
He was teaching a Shakespeare class –
"A Midsummer Night's Dream. "

166
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,414
He was doing Puck,
and then suddenly he wasn't.

167
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:58,623
Oh, man.
- And the class was so into his reading,

168
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:03,105
they didn't even get it. They thought
he was acting. It was Dick Shawn all over again.

169
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:06,722
Where are you?
- I'm in his flat trying to get his effects squared away, and,

170
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:11,236
of course, his family is acting like
spoiled children. All they care about is what they get.

171
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,142
If I have to moderate one more argument
about the Chippendale desk, I'm going to freak out.

172
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:20,687
And the lawyer handling his affairs
is a moron, and don't even get me started on the funeral.

173
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:24,598
He wanted to be cremated, but if you
had seen how filthy that crematorium was

174
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:28,135
- so I shipped him to Cambridge,
which apparently is known for its cremation facilities.

175
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,222
That was a transportation nightmare,
and, of course,

176
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:33,938
his daughter was upset with the move,
but where was she at Thanksgiving, huh?

177
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:37,145
Is there anything I can do to help?
- No. Thanks.

178
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,002
I'm sad.
- I know.

179
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:44,185
Bye.
- Bye.

180
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:48,846
Asher Fleming died.
- In bed?

181
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,258
No.
- Damn. I lost the pool.

182
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,816
Are you sure?

183
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,043
Jerry found her birth certificate
stashed in her bathroom.

184
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:02,811
I am not surprised. She knew way too
much about sushi to be from Kentucky.

185
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,375
Hi, ladies. What's the dirt today?
- Jerry Cutler's new wife, Annabel.

186
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,613
Oh, that name alone.

187
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:13,177
Turns out the 24-year-old former
Miss Magnolia Blossom had a little secret.

188
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:14,591
What?
- Her birthday!

189
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:19,563
Seems that 24 is actually code for 36.
- No!

190
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:21,942
Yep. Jerry the moron wound up with a tramp

191
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,810
who's actually a year older than
the wife he dumped her for.

192
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:28,722
You got to love the karma.
- How's Jerry taking it?

193
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:33,220
He's getting his eyeglass prescription checked.
- CNN's got nothing on you gals. See ya.

194
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:34,588
See you later, sugar.

195
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:39,248
So, you heard that Marilyn
Horne is actually a man?

196
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:41,218
I'm not surprised.

197
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:45,409
I sent the check off to the landscaper a week ago.
- He claims he hasn't received it.

198
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,852
Well, he's lying.
- Shall I tell him that?

199
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:50,622
I will stop payment on the check
and issue another one.

200
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,784
Fine. There's the issue of the
Gregorys' cocktail party on the fourth.

201
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,325
Even though they did miss our
Christmas party last year,

202
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,122
you are currently involved in a business deal
with Hamilton, so one of us should probably attend.

203
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,811
Jancy will definitely want you to be there.
- Fine. I'll go.

204
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,564
No, that's all right. I should go.
- Fine, then you'll go

205
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:08,009
Though I had to go to the
Newmans' Zoo Auction last week.

206
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:11,480
Fine. Then I'll go.
- No, it's my business. I'll go.

207
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,157
Fine.
- Unless you would like to go.

208
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:16,271
Moving on to the subject of your car
- Excuse me?

209
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:19,400
You parked the Cadillac in the driveway
when you worked on it this weekend,

210
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,180
and it leaked oil all over the place.
- It's a tiny stain, Emily.

211
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,571
It's a large stain, and I see it every
day when I walk in and out of the door.

212
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:30,253
Really? You can see the driveway with
your nose way up in the air like that?

213
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:33,917
I apologize. That was uncalled for.

214
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:36,576
I think you should restrict your
cars to their garages at all times.

215
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:38,480
I will park my cars anywhere I like.

216
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:40,566
You never used to leave your cars
in the driveway before.

217
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,478
I park there when I work on them.
- Well, work on them somewhere else.

218
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:45,440
Like where?

219
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:48,146
- What about the filling station?
It's already filthy there.

220
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:49,724
Are you seriously suggesting...

221
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:55,331
that I drive a priceless antique car 12 blocks
away, park it next to a broken-down Chevy,

222
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:57,368
and do my restoring there?
- Yes.

223
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,250
So this is the way it's going to be from now on.
- I suppose it is.

224
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:07,062
A filling station will be fine.
- Thank you.

225
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:11,871
I suppose we should discuss the insurance papers.
- I suppose we should.

226
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,938
I mean, I always thought I looked
a lot like my Uncle Jerry,

227
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,187
and, gee, Mom seemed to really
like him.

228
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,625
I cannot believe this. After all this
time, your mother tells you now.

229
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,726
I swear... My dad looked relieved.
- He did not.

230
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:28,167
I heard him say, "whew!"
- Oh, that is amazing.

231
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:29,941
So, what did you do over the summer?

232
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:32,566
Well, we so should have started with me.

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,678
Oh, sorry.
- No, seriously, you couldn't see me there?

234
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,067
Not everyone's staring at you, Colin.
- Hey, I know you. No, wait-wait, don't tell me.

235
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,758
I'm seeing a uniform of some sort.
- Maytag repairman.

236
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:46,808
I've bartended for you - for your parties. -
That's right, you have. You're a talented man.

237
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,188
He makes a kick-ass margarita.
- thanks

238
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,033
It's good to see you again. What's your name?
- Marty. Uh, this is Rory.

239
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:56,651
Hi. So, assuming your services
are still for hire this year,

240
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,835
your financial situation hasn't changed at all?
- Nope.

241
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,117
Good. Okay, I'll give you a call.
Where are you living now?

242
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:02,076
Branford.

243
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,223
Oh, excellent - Branford.
All right. Good running into you.

244
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,025
Excellent shirt.
- I can see what you see in him.

245
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,474
Don't be an ass, Colin.

246
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:13,435
Me? Never. I'm a friend to all people,
large and very, very small.

247
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,990
I kind of hate those guys.
- Really? I can't see why.

248
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:22,710
Wow.

249
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:27,402
I moved some things around. I also switched
our rooms. Now, mine may seem bigger, but

250
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,651
yours gets less sun, so you don't
have to worry about melanoma.

251
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:31,495
Hey.
- What?

252
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:32,616
Sorry.

253
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:34,263
Thanks.

254
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,739
So, how are you holding up?

255
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:41,629
I'm fine. I'm actually relieved to be anywhere that
people aren't arguing over the first-edition Faulkners.

256
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:43,716
His granddaughter Sarah is the worst.

257
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:46,908
If she thought the casket was worth anything,
she would have stuffed it in her purse.

258
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:50,214
You know Paris, you don't have to take
care of all this. It's not up to you.

259
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,670
I know. It's just I want
his memory to be respected.

260
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:54,842
It will be.

261
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:58,217
I still can't believe he's gone.

262
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,197
He left me his manuscripts.
- Wow.

263
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,930
Yeah. If Sarah finds out, it's going to
be the mountain girl trial all over again.

264
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:09,232
Listen, I want to have a wake.
- A what?

265
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,254
A wake in Asher's honor here.

266
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:15,375
We'll give others the chance to pay
their respects, to say goodbye.

267
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:19,075
People are going to want this closure.
I just think it's the right thing to do.

268
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,380
Sure.
- Thank you.

269
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:29,895
Hello? Larry, Larry, no. I'm sorry. Did
you take the bar or just hang out in one?

270
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:40,323
Hey.
- Oh, hey. I was -

271
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:43,581
No, I was just coming to...
- - pick you up. Was I not supposed to?

272
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:45,700
No, I figured I'd meet you at the diner.
- Oooh.

273
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:47,852
Yeah..
- I guess we should have discussed.

274
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:49,351
No-no, I should have assumed
- I mean, we u-usually -

275
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:52,707
Yeah, but this is a date, so the guy
usually does - in the truck, and so -

276
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:53,797
Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

277
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,425
I could go back inside.
- No, no, this is fine. You're out now, so...

278
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:00,920
We should go.
- We should go.

279
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:07,145
You don't have to get the -

280
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,316
okay.
- There you go.

281
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:16,791
We'll get better at this.
- Yeah.

282
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:25,085
Oh. Oh, wow. Very 'Prancing Pony'.
- This way, please.

283
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,517
Your table, Miss.
- Oh. Why, thank you, sir.

284
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,285
"Reserved. "
- I told you I'd planned the evening.

285
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,976
Weren't we supposed to let someone
who works here seat us?

286
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,077
Not necessary.
- Is this like a Mafia thing?

287
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:43,270
Excuse me?
- The whole coming in, special table, reserved sign.

288
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,291
Are you gonna have to whack someone
before the soup course?

289
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,210
No, I've filled my whacking
quota for the week. Dirty?

290
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:49,515
Extremely.
- Thought so.

291
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,390
Lucas!
- How you doing, Maisy?

292
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,751
You just seat yourself now?
- I told him!

293
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:57,484
We run a nice place here, Lucas,
not like that hash joint of yours.

294
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,101
And this must be your young lady.
Hello, there. I'm Maisy.

295
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,343
Hi. I'm Lorelai. I love your place.
- It used to be a whorehouse.

296
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,918
Oh - my.
- I like that it's got a tarty history.

297
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,238
The best places do.
- And the best people.

298
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:12,360
'The best people'. I like that.
Buddy! Will you sit down?

299
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:13,812
Well, you pulled me up.

300
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:18,421
Buddy, this is Lorelai.
- Lorelai. Well, hello, Lorelai.

301
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:19,483
Hello, Buddy.

302
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:23,265
This is very exciting for us because
Lucas never brings his giris here.

303
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:27,679
Lori, some sparkling water and champagne.
- And a beer.

304
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:31,151
You're on a date, you drink champagne.
You're at a ball game, you drink a beer.

305
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,715
My goodness, what a big menu.

306
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,086
Don't bother looking. Whatever you order,
they'll just bring you something different.

307
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,439
Hey, what about the, uh -
- Oh, yeah, good. With garlic and -

308
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,343
No, no, no garlic.
I mean, give the boy a chance.

309
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:49,351
Lorelai, nice to meet you, and,
uh, he's a special one, this guy.

310
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:50,574
That's the word on the street.

311
00:17:53,444 --> 00:17:54,761
They know you.

312
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:58,331
Actually, I come here two,
three times a week.

313
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:01,996
Yeah - breakfast, dinner,
whenever I have the time.

314
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:03,821
Oh, my God, Luke has a 'Luke's'.

315
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:08,077
Yeah, well, y'know. I've known Maisy and Bud my
whole life. Maisy went to school with my mother.

316
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,764
Really?
- Yeah. And then later on when my dad died

317
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:15,312
and I wanted to turn the hardware store into
a diner, you know, Buddy really helped me out.

318
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:17,821
That's so nice.
- He's a good guy. He really showed me

319
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:20,735
how to run a restaurant,
how to order - everything, basically.

320
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,170
I mean, I couldn't have done it
without him.

321
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,663
I love this place.
- It's a great place - very old.

322
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:27,677
How long have they owned it?
- Actually, the story of that is on the back of the menu.

323
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:28,753
Oh, cool.

324
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:35,714
Oh, look - "Sniffy's Tavern: A story of love. "
Oh, a story of love. "Maisy Fortner

325
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:40,308
and Bertram 'Buddy' Linds met at a high-school
basketball game. She was playing, he was not.

326
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:44,656
They fell in love, got married. Buddy went to
work at a dairy, and Maisy worked at the school,

327
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:48,520
but they dreamed to someday own a restaurant
so that all of their friends and family

328
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:52,022
could come and eat and visit
and laugh with them every single day. "

329
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:53,978
Buddy hated working at that dairy.

330
00:18:55,184 --> 00:19:00,269
"One day Sniffy, their beloved dog, ran away.
Maisy and Buddy searched high and low for him.

331
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:04,929
Finally they stumbled past a dilapidated
old tavern that had been boarded up for years.

332
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:09,933
They heard a dog howling. They forced open the
door, and there was Sniffy, stuck underneath a

333
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:14,268
fallen beam. Maisy and Buddy pulled Sniffy free
and rushed him to the vet, where he immediately

334
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:18,961
went into emergency surgery. " Oh my God, did
Paul Thomas Anderson write this? Edit, people.

335
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:21,680
You don't have to read the whole thing.
There's not gonna be a quiz.

336
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:22,806
I'm almost done.

337
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:30,041
"Four hours later... Sniffy was dead. "
Sniffy was dead?! Are you serious?

338
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:32,387
Where's the happy ending?
- Well, that's what happened.

339
00:19:32,762 --> 00:19:34,864
Well, people don't read the back of
the menu to find out what really happened.

340
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:37,701
They read the back of the menu
to be happy, to be uplifted.

341
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:40,992
- That's why they read the back of the menu.
Not that many people read the back of the menu.

342
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:43,697
Did you know about
the whole Sniffy thing?

343
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,826
If it makes you feel better,
Sniffy was 150,000 years old.

344
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:47,836
You're lying.

345
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:51,910
Thank you.

346
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:54,321
Hey, here's to you.
- I'll drink to that.

347
00:19:57,842 --> 00:19:59,242
Yep, I definitely hate champagne.

348
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:02,729
- This is nice.
- Good.

349
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:06,981
Hey, do you remember the first time we met?
- What?

350
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:11,985
I'm just trying to remember the first time
we met. It must have been at Luke's, right?

351
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,801
It was at Luke's, it was at lunch, it was a very
busy day, the place was packed, and this person -

352
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:20,069
Ooh, is it me? Is it me?

353
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,610
This person comes tearing into
the place in a caffeine frenzy.

354
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:23,523
Ooh, it's me.

355
00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:28,525
I was with a customer. She interrupts me,
wild-eyed, begging for coffee, so I tell her

356
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:32,322
to wait her turn. Then she starts following
me around, talking a mile a minute,

357
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:38,221
saying God knows what. So finally I turn
to her, and I tell her she's being annoying -

358
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:40,046
sit down, shut up, I'll get to her
when I get to her.

359
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:43,222
Y'know, I bet she took that very well,
'cause she sounds just delightful.

360
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:47,035
She asked me what my birthday was. I
wouldn't tell her. She wouldn't stop talking.

361
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:52,608
I gave in. I told her my birthday. Then she
opened up the newspaper to the horoscope page,

362
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:56,422
wrote something down, tore it out,
handed it to me.

363
00:20:56,831 --> 00:21:00,904
God, seriously. You wrote the menu, didn't you?
- So I'm looking at this piece of paper in my hand,

364
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:04,131
and under "Scorpio," she had written,
"you will meet an annoying woman today.

365
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,427
Give her coffee and she'll go away. "
I gave her coffee.

366
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:07,813
But she didn't go away.

367
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:13,173
She told me to hold on to that horoscope, put
it in my wallet, and carry it around with me

368
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:15,422
one day it would bring me luck.

369
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:19,334
Well, man, I will say anything or a cup of coffee

370
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:26,260
Um... I can't believe you kept this.
You kept this in your wallet?

371
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:29,305
You kept this in your wallet.
- Eight years.

372
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:30,936
Eight years.

373
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:37,373
Lorelai, this thing we're doing here
- me, you -

374
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,286
I just want you to know I'm in.
I am all in.

375
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:48,065
Does that, uh - are you, uh, scared?

376
00:22:01,477 --> 00:22:07,409
I can't believe you kept that horoscope.
- You're just lucky I never clean out my wallet.

377
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:12,703
You can't take it back now. You've exposed
yourself. You've been pining for me.

378
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,070
I have not been pining.
- I'm your Ava Gardner.

379
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:18,732
God help me.

380
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:26,310
Okay. Let's get something
out of the way right now.

381
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:27,550
What?

382
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:32,161
What are you doing?

383
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:37,163
- Tell me what CD's to get so
I don't have to hear about it.

384
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:38,515
Seriously?

385
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:42,393
And skip any '80s groups where the guys dressed
up like pirates. I draw the line at pirates.

386
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:45,736
This has been a really great
first date.

387
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,495
It only took us eight years
to get here.

388
00:22:52,235 --> 00:22:53,590
Okay. So, U2, right?

389
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:56,081
Yeah, Bono is a must,
and Blondie and, um, ooh -

390
00:22:56,652 --> 00:23:00,792
Sparks, especially the new one,
plus Bowie.

391
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:04,816
Okay, I know he dressed up like a pirate.
- Space man.

392
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:06,625
Space man I can deal with.

393
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:12,264
Mmm.

394
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:15,100
Sorry. I forgot to turn
the alarm off.

395
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:18,718
Bad alarm. Bad, bad alarm.

396
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:26,489
What time is it?
- Early.

397
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,560
Hate early. Must kill early.

398
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:32,909
Okay. I gotta get up.

399
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:35,404
Why?

400
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,738
Work. Inn. Buy shoes.

401
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,138
Oh, my God, I can't move.
I need coffee.

402
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:46,778
I don't have coffee up here.
It's all downstairs.

403
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:53,101
Downstairs. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

404
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:02,013
Where are you going?

405
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:17,316
Well, I think people are gonna know.

406
00:24:17,968 --> 00:24:19,058
What? What are you talking about?

407
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:23,672
Why are you wearing my shirt?
- I put it on to go get coffee.

408
00:24:24,827 --> 00:24:26,522
Downstairs?
- Well, you don't keep it upstairs.

409
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:28,087
The diner's open.
- You're kidding!

410
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:31,410
You walked into the diner like that?
- I didn't think the diner could open without you.

411
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,491
I had Caesar open.
- Well, he did, with a floor show.

412
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:38,238
Okay, so, maybe nobody noticed.
- Look at me!

413
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:42,116
Okay, yes. Well, but you wear
crazy outfits all the time.

414
00:24:42,476 --> 00:24:43,258
They usually include pants.

415
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:47,495
Okay, so they know. So what? I mean,
they're gonna find out eventually, right?

416
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:50,964
Right. So, we'll hear about it for a few days.
- Few weeks.

417
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:53,166
Six months of hearing about it,
but then it'll die down.

418
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:54,028
We'll be used to it.

419
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:57,468
And everything will get back to normal,
so, okay, well, they know.

420
00:24:58,427 --> 00:24:59,113
It's out.
- It's out.

421
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:02,128
Where's your coffee?

422
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:03,724
Mm-hmm.

423
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:06,087
I'M getting your coffee.

424
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:11,888
I need more candles.
- Check my trunk. I think my mom put some in there.

425
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:14,642
That's a lot of books you got there.

426
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:18,880
The very fact that the bookstore had any in stock
shows the sad nature of American reading habits.

427
00:25:20,738 --> 00:25:24,860
Do you need some help with those?
- I got this, but here – you can put these up.

428
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:26,423
You made flyers.

429
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:29,520
Anyone who wants to pay tribute to
this great man deserves the opportunity.

430
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:30,432
I'm on it.

431
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:41,155
Okay, Quinn, last building.
Please say it looks familiar.

432
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:42,523
Ahh, uh…

433
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,203
Apparently it doesn't look familiar.

434
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:48,454
No, hold on. Hold on. Yes. Here.

435
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:49,856
This is where she lives.

436
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:52,416
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- No thanks.

437
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:54,387
Hey.

438
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,146
Don't put your number.
Don't put your number!

439
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:57,744
I'm not putting my number,
I'm putting your number.

440
00:25:58,445 --> 00:25:58,981
That's my room.

441
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:01,411
Okay, put my number.

442
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:03,985
Are you sure this is your room?
- I'm sure.

443
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:06,950
I could have sworn it was her room.
- What's her name? Maybe I know her.

444
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,367
Uh, it was short.

445
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:12,788
I can understand your disappointment, losing a
potential soul mate like that, but that is my room.

446
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:15,019
I'm sorry about the mix-up.
My friend here means no harm.

447
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,008
He just has to learn that Guinness
and blondes - they don't mix.

448
00:26:17,513 --> 00:26:17,856
Redheads!

449
00:26:19,306 --> 00:26:22,254
We sincerely apologize, and we will now leave
you to finish putting up your póster of...

450
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:24,912
this really old guy.

451
00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:28,545
Professor Asher Fleming.
- What, they were out of Orlando Bloom?

452
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:31,463
Professor Fleming died last week.
We're throwing him a wake.

453
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,646
Okay, so were you and Fleming -
- No!

454
00:26:34,037 --> 00:26:36,986
Sorry. Just you're putting a póster
of him up in your hallway.

455
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,090
You can see where I get the impressión
he's a little bit more than a teacher.

456
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,950
Well, he was more than a teacher.
He was a great writer

457
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:46,634
and an inspiration in many other things
that you couldn't possibly understand.

458
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:48,345
You don't like me.

459
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:50,920
You don't know me,
but you don't like me.

460
00:26:51,488 --> 00:26:52,809
I know you.
- You do?

461
00:26:53,704 --> 00:26:54,520
We met yesterday.

462
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,387
With Marty.
- Marty?

463
00:26:58,203 --> 00:26:59,785
Marty - my friend Marty.
He bartended for you.

464
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:04,266
Yes, Marty. I'm sorry. It slipped my mind.
Of course I met you yesterday with Marty.

465
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,114
Nice to see you again...

466
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:06,858
Rory!

467
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:10,133
Nice to see you again, Rory. You're
looking well. Angry works for you.

468
00:27:10,523 --> 00:27:11,859
I'm not angry, I'm just irritated.

469
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:13,000
- By me?
- Yes.

470
00:27:13,604 --> 00:27:14,940
Because I forgot for a moment
who you were?

471
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,701
No, because you speak to people
as if they're below you.

472
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:18,036
People?
- Marty.

473
00:27:18,492 --> 00:27:19,177
Ah, your friend Marty?

474
00:27:19,747 --> 00:27:21,963
Yes, my friend, Marty. You talked
to him like he was dirt,

475
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:23,234
and that's why I'm looking at you
like this.

476
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:27,097
I'm sorry. What did I say that was so bad? I said
hello and I think I said he made a kick-ass margarita

477
00:27:27,405 --> 00:27:28,597
It's not what you said,
it's how you said it.

478
00:27:28,987 --> 00:27:30,827
How'd I say it?
- Like Judi Dench.

479
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:32,163
Ouch.

480
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:35,650
Just because somebody doesn't have money or a
fancy family doesn't mean they're inferior to you.

481
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:36,661
I agree.

482
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:39,724
And just because somebody is a bartender
at a party for you and your friends,

483
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:42,168
that doesn't mean that you can talk
to them like a servant.

484
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:45,805
Well...
- What?!

485
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,380
I hired him. I paid him. He served.
That's what a servant does.

486
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:50,628
Are you serious?
- For the sake of argument.

487
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:53,204
He was doing a job.
- A job he took willingly.

488
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:54,590
Some people have to work.

489
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:57,133
And I bet if you ask him he'll tell you
he made excellent tips that night.

490
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:58,679
Because my friends –
they tend to enjoy their re-fills.

491
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:01,579
Not the point.
- To a bartender, tips are very much the point.

492
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,475
Just because you pay somebody, it doesn't mean that
you can speak to them as if they're beneath you.

493
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:10,136
Actually, the fact that this is a free country means
I can speak to anyone in any manner which I choose.

494
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:13,852
However, the rules of a civilized society may
frown upon a certain obvious show of snobbery,

495
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:15,675
so if that's your argument -
- I don't have an argument.

496
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:17,860
I can give you a moment to formulate one
if you want to continue.

497
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:19,309
I'm busy!
- You concede.

498
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:23,317
I don't like it when people hurt my friends.
- And you react when goaded.

499
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:26,302
I am not goaded. I am so far from goaded.
Get out your compass,

500
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:29,788
and I will show you how far from goaded I am.
- I think we got a serious debater in our midst.

501
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:31,972
Logan, I think we've found it.

502
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:38,424
Tell Marty I said hi, and I promise
to remember you instantly next time.

503
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:42,906
Now, tell me that wasn't fun?

504
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:49,389
Master and Commander.

505
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:52,928
- The movie? No, that's what I
want you to call me from now on.

506
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,121
Ugh.

507
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:02,998
I just wanted to smell like him again.

508
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:21,851
You didn't! You didn't.

509
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:24,979
Morning, ladies.
- - Oh, morning, Sugar.

510
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,597
Samson and Delilah Sapperstein
got back together.

511
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:30,553
I'm not surprised.
Those two belong together.

512
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:33,517
Well, its nice that they made up. That
means they're bound to have one of their

513
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:37,266
fabulous fights very soon, which we need
because things are slow around here.

514
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:38,341
I hear that.

515
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,633
- They're lowering the free-parking
limit at the drugstore.

516
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:45,529
You only get 20 minutes free
with validation instead of 30.

517
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,788
Well, times, they are a-changin'.

518
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,072
Well, so, I'm gonna go.
I got to get to work.

519
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:53,937
Bye, honey.

520
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:55,338
Give Rory a kiss for us.

521
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,349
I will.

522
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,649
Did you notice that one side of
Rosella's butt implant deflated?

523
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,326
Well, if your doctor
accepts a cupon...

524
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,602
Nobody knows. I swear.
- How do you know?

525
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:11,372
Well, I walked by "Hello! Magazine"
this morning. They mentioned nothing.

526
00:30:11,813 --> 00:30:14,826
Well, maybe they're just trying to be,
I don't know, respectful about it.

527
00:30:15,153 --> 00:30:16,018
Babette? Miss Patty?

528
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:19,603
Well, maybe they're trying not to embarrass you.
- Babette? Miss Patty?

529
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,193
Well, maybe - I'm out.

530
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:26,252
Has anyone mentioned it to you?
- No, but, seriously, who's gonna mention it to me?

531
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:28,971
Babette? Miss Patty?
- No, it's been very quiet.

532
00:30:29,623 --> 00:30:31,154
They have to know.
- Maybe they don't care.

533
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:32,883
That's kind of a bummer.
- Why?

534
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,997
I don't know. You at least want
them to have some interest.

535
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:40,117
Let's just look at it this way. It's out. We
don't have to worry about it. We can just go on.

536
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:41,406
Are we still on for tonight?

537
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,371
Liz Taylor and Richard Burton couldn't go
outside without people noticing.

538
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:48,298
Well, I'll get drunk, you gain 500 pounds,
and we'll give it another go.

539
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:49,912
Pick me up at 7:00?
- I'll pick you up at 7:00.

540
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:50,872
Okay, bye.

541
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:02,996
Madonna Louise!

542
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,240
Can I get you some dessert, Mrs. Gilmore?
- No, thank you.

543
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:07,446
Very good, Mrs. Gilmore.

544
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,589
And don't run the dishwasher. It's not full.
- I won't, Mrs. Gilmore.

545
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:14,323
I smelled something funny earlier
in the northeast corner of the kitchen.

546
00:31:14,761 --> 00:31:15,773
I sprayed for ants this afternoon.

547
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:19,406
Oh, Madonna Louise, I told you never spray
that poison all over the place.

548
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:24,133
You simply have to kill the scout ants so they don't
go back and tell the rest of them where the food is.

549
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:25,061
I know Mrs. Gilmore.

550
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,337
You kill the scouts, or you use the chalk
that we bought in Chinatown last month.

551
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:29,250
Okay, Mrs. Gilmore.

552
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,580
Madonna Louise?
- Yes, Mrs. Gilmore?

553
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:34,074
It was a lovely omelet.
- Thank you, Mrs. Gilmore.

554
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:42,843
How did I get rooked into this?
- Uh, I'm irresistible?

555
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:45,353
Yeah. Well, have I mentioned
I hate town meetings?

556
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:49,622
No. I thought you said you hate
clown bleedings, which I totally agree with.

557
00:32:50,162 --> 00:32:53,467
Oh, no. Is tonight raffle night?
I can't deal with raffle night.

558
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:58,128
No, it's not raffle night. Look, I promise we won't
stay for the whole thing. It'll be like a stop by.

559
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:02,806
We'll just run in and get the headlines so I have
something to tell Rory, and then we're off to the movie.

560
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:06,601
Do not get used to me going to these town
things. Just because you like them does not mean

561
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,553
that I will ever like them or
tolerate them or go to them.

562
00:33:09,926 --> 00:33:11,671
Hmm. Other than tonight?
- Yes, other than tonight.

563
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:14,083
And next Thursday.
- I did not say I would go next Thursday.

564
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:15,923
What the hell is next Thursday?

565
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:19,752
Hello?
- Lorelai? Oh, thank God I found you.

566
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:21,189
Hi, Mom.

567
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:25,278
The most bizarre thing has happened. At
7:30 at night, I had just finished my dinner.

568
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,699
I was about to go upstairs and read,
and I suddenly heard a car.

569
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:29,219
Uh-huh.

570
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,577
I ran to the window just in time to see
your father driving away.

571
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:33,212
Uh-huh.

572
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:35,396
He was driving away at 7:30 at night.

573
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,750
Uh-huh.
- Lorelai!

574
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:39,665
Was he driving backwards or with his feet?
- Where was your father going at 7:30 at night?

575
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:46,396
Well, maybe he had a business meeting.
- At 7:30 at night? What, has he suddenly become a bootlegger?

576
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:50,307
Mom, I'm sorry. I'm about to go into a thing.
Can we talk about this later?

577
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:54,562
Oh, absolutely. Far be it for me to intrude
on whatever vague event you're going to.

578
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:56,094
Great! Thanks, Mom. Bye.

579
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:58,178
Your fault.
- How was that my fault?

580
00:33:58,585 --> 00:34:01,144
Because you preoccupied me with all
your yammering about the meeting,

581
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:04,794
so I wasn't thinking, and I didn't check
to see who was calling before I answered.

582
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,807
Boy, it's nice to finally
have someone to blame.

583
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:12,616
And then looked, backed up -
- No.

584
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:13,739
I did too back up.

585
00:34:14,163 --> 00:34:17,408
You backed up. You didn't look.
You got in, you turned on your car,

586
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,127
and then you whipped out of that space
like you were Lizzie Grubman.

587
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,417
Do we have timing or what?

588
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,712
I did not.
- Andrew, you did too.

589
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:26,319
I distinctly remember looking in my mirror
and seeing nothing.

590
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:27,608
Except me.
- I didn't see you.

591
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,075
Liar
- I am not a liar.

592
00:34:30,622 --> 00:34:32,789
Thank you for coming.
Please feel free to take a book.

593
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:38,410
Hey.
- Hi.

594
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:40,188
Interesting crowd.

595
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:45,124
Yeah, most of the people have no idea they're at
a wake. They think it's some weird theme party.

596
00:34:45,744 --> 00:34:49,459
I've spent the entire evening trying to get people
to stop referring to Asher as "the old dead dude. "

597
00:34:50,306 --> 00:34:52,671
Does Paris know?
- Paris, thank goodness, is Paris.

598
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:56,841
Hi, Marty. Thank you for coming.
Please help yourself to a book.

599
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:59,268
The wake seems to be going well.
- It is.

600
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:04,436
I'm very pleased with the turnout. I mean, I
knew he was beloved, but this is overwhelming.

601
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:09,650
You know, it's funny, but Asher died right
at the height of my passión for him.

602
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,751
I kind of wonder what would have happened
if he had lived.

603
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,288
Would I have stayed in love with him forever?
- I don't know.

604
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:19,395
He died before I could find out.
Now I'll always be in love with him.

605
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:21,872
He's my Mike Todd.

606
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:27,804
We're going to dinner after the movie.
- I know.

607
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,345
All those who think Andrew was
in the wrong, arms raised.

608
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,945
All those who think that Gypsy
was at fault, arms raised.

609
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:39,928
The majority rules. Gypsy is at fault for the
fender bender outside the Stars Hollow Garden Center

610
00:35:40,317 --> 00:35:42,582
and shall be responsible for
all said damages.

611
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:45,483
Ha! We have got to get a courthouse
in this town!

612
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,716
All right, let's move on to the next
order of business.

613
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,828
Hmm. A very serious matter has been
brought to our attention,

614
00:35:51,237 --> 00:35:55,554
and I would like to bring to the floor for
discussión the possible negative ramifications

615
00:35:55,977 --> 00:35:59,710
of the inn owner and diner owner dating.
- That's us.

616
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:00,930
They're talking about us.

617
00:36:01,404 --> 00:36:06,163
Now, as you all know, the relationship we have
feared for some time has emerged, and we need

618
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:09,129
to carefully consider whether or
not we can support this.

619
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,183
Oh, my God.
- We're sitting right here!

620
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:16,184
Yes, we see you, Luke, and, as a member of the
town, you are welcome to voice your opinion.

621
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:17,422
Voice my -

622
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,313
I open the floor up for discussión.

623
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:26,351
All right. I'll start. Luke's Diner is a staple in
this town. Most of us eat there on a regular basis.

624
00:36:26,826 --> 00:36:31,892
The Dragonfly Inn, though newer than Luke's Diner,
has also become very important in our community.

625
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:38,430
The co-mingling of the owners of these two
establishments can only set the stage for disaster.

626
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:41,328
What the hell is he talking about?
- Well he's not happy with our co-mingling.

627
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:45,890
Think of the consequences. What will
happen when the relationship goes sour,

628
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,197
as, let's face it, most of Lorelai's relationships do?
- Hey!

629
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:53,615
We'll have to choose. Suddenly you'll either
be a 'Luke' or a 'Lorelai', or,

630
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:57,868
if you're Kirk and you can't make a decisión
to save your life, you'll be neither.

631
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:58,909
He's probably right.

632
00:36:59,415 --> 00:37:02,462
That's bad for the economy, bad for
the town. I vote against this.

633
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,622
Are they gonna make us break up?
- I think you're over reacting, Taylor.

634
00:37:06,097 --> 00:37:10,497
People, do I have to remind you about
Fay Wellington and Art Brush, huh? Do I?

635
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:11,359
Uh, yeah.

636
00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:16,983
Fay owned a flower shop, and Art owned
a candy store, and they fell madly in love

637
00:37:17,388 --> 00:37:19,637
about 10 years ago - big romance.

638
00:37:20,061 --> 00:37:24,656
And for a while, it all worked very synergistically.
Flowers and candy seemed like a perfect match...

639
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:27,100
Until Art met Margie.
- The fudge queen.

640
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,698
Ooh, that was bad.

641
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:30,817
The whole town split right
down the middle.

642
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:33,180
Suddenly you could buy flowers
or you could buy candy.

643
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:36,291
Valentine's Day was a nightmare.
Par for the course for me.

644
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:39,258
Eventually, the hostility
forced Art to move.

645
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:42,925
Fay never married. She stopped
making candy. It was very sad.

646
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:46,738
And those storefronts were empty
for a year. No one wanted to be there.

647
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,426
God, this sounds terrible.
Maybe they have a point.

648
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,245
No, they don't have a point.
- Well, what if something happens?

649
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:57,280
This is crazy. I don't believe that
the breakup of Fay Wellington and Art Brush

650
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:01,354
affected the economy of this town one bit.
- Well, lucky for you, I brought charts.

651
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:05,786
You have charts concerning the romance of
two people who used to live here 10 years ago?

652
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:09,338
We think Fay still lives in the caves
above the Clancys' Mill.

653
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:13,673
We can't prove it, but every so often,
we hear "Delta Dawn" playing over and over.

654
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:14,766
Hello?

655
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:17,861
Your father came home at 8:30. He went
inside the poolhouse for five minutes,

656
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:20,353
and he got back in his car,
and he drove away again.

657
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,657
Mom, this is really not a good -

658
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:23,696
Traipsing all over the place
at all hours of the night.

659
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:27,132
Uh-huh. Mom, where are you?
You sound very far away.

660
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:30,768
Park Road.
- Park Road. Why?

661
00:38:31,272 --> 00:38:34,320
I'm not gonna be the one that sits at home
alone in the dark like an Italian widow.

662
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:37,351
If he can go out, then I can go out,
so I went out.

663
00:38:37,822 --> 00:38:38,572
Well, good for you.

664
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:40,527
I figured I'd have dinner.
I already had dinner.

665
00:38:41,392 --> 00:38:43,265
But if Richard's having two dinners,
then I can have two dinners,

666
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:46,314
so I went to a place I used to eat at
when I was in college.

667
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:47,454
And do you know what I found?

668
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:51,169
It's a 'Lube-And-Tune' with
an X-rated T-shirt store next door.

669
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:55,177
Mom, this is silly. Why don't you just go home?
- I'm not gonna be the first one back.

670
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:57,116
Well, how long are you gonna drive around?

671
00:38:57,475 --> 00:39:01,288
Until I'm sure your father came home.
Let him worry about where I was all night.

672
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:04,579
Look, I can't talk right now.
- Well, I'm not done.

673
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:06,828
I'll call you later.
- I could be dead later.

674
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:07,904
Call one of your friends.

675
00:39:08,247 --> 00:39:10,462
No one knows about the separation
except you and Rory.

676
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:12,923
Well, I'm sorry, Mom. I'm in
the middle of something very important.

677
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:14,912
Well, this is important, too.
Meet me for a coffee.

678
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,108
Mom, I can't, and Rory just moved in,
and she's at school getting settled,

679
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:20,599
so if you really can't talk to one
of your friends, I'm sorry,

680
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:21,820
but we're gonna have to finish this later.

681
00:39:22,212 --> 00:39:23,239
Fine.

682
00:39:26,677 --> 00:39:27,770
I think that map's a little off.

683
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,827
Luke would definitely take the Northwest
block 'cause it's near the fishing hole.

684
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:34,336
Okay, that's it. I've heard enough.

685
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:40,546
This is my relationship - mine,
not yours, not yours, not yours,

686
00:39:41,114 --> 00:39:47,488
yours, but not yours. Mine and hers
but not - yours!

687
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,761
There's not gonna be any more debating
about whether or not it's a good idea

688
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,248
if we're in a relationship,
'cause we're in a relationship.

689
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,837
Show them the horoscope!
- But in the event of a breakup -

690
00:39:57,233 --> 00:40:00,653
There's not going to be a breakup.
- Well, isn't he the optimistic fellow?

691
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:05,641
Fine. In case of a breakup, I'll move. I'll
close up Luke's Diner, I'll go far, far away,

692
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:09,063
and that way you won't have to choose,
okay? Every section in town can be pink.

693
00:40:09,078 --> 00:40:10,221
Can we have your word on that?

694
00:40:10,629 --> 00:40:12,877
You can have my word and a couple of
middle fingers on that, Taylor.

695
00:40:13,283 --> 00:40:15,940
Get that down. We have his word.
Leave out the part about the fingers.

696
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:22,115
All right, people, it seems that the issue of
Gilmore and Danes vs. Stars Hollow has been resolved.

697
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:25,785
See you all next week when everyone
gets fingerprinted for the government.

698
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:27,396
Meeting adjourned.

699
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,957
Wow!
- Yeah.

700
00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:34,746
You still in?
- You bet I am.

701
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:38,266
Oh, my God.
- What? What's the matter?

702
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:42,374
Hello?

703
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:44,362
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
- For what?

704
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:47,377
Rory.
- Grandma.

705
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:50,163
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

706
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:51,370
What is going on here?

707
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:53,651
I have to hang up now.
- Have I mentioned I'm sorry?

708
00:40:54,154 --> 00:40:54,466
Bye.

709
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:56,682
Well, this is a surprise.

710
00:40:57,431 --> 00:40:59,908
I simply had to get out of the house
and your mother told me you were home,

711
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,541
so I thought I'd come by and say hello. Why
are there pictures of Asher Fleming everywhere?

712
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:06,655
This is a wake for Professor Fleming.
He died.

713
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:10,027
You'd think your grandfather
ould have mentioned that to me, but no.

714
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,010
I bet he'll make me go to that
insufferable man's funeral, though.

715
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:15,339
He was cremated.
- Oh, thank God.

716
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:16,303
Emily!

717
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:19,886
It means so much to me that you came.

718
00:41:20,553 --> 00:41:23,063
- Well, yes. Asher was very devoted
to his students.

719
00:41:24,222 --> 00:41:27,234
Oh, now, there's no need to cry.
Yale is full of excellent teachers.

720
00:41:29,808 --> 00:41:30,298
Root beer?

721
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:35,610
Yeah. Thanks, Marty, for everything.
You've been such a huge help tonight.

722
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,305
For you, anything. Hey, Rory?
- Hmm?

723
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:43,434
Do you –
I mean, how come you don't have a-a -

724
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:45,877
do you have a boyfriend?

725
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:47,052
What?

726
00:41:47,474 --> 00:41:48,923
I'm just curious.
You don't mention anyone.

727
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:52,281
There's no one here you seem to be with,
so I was just wondering what the deal was.

728
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,801
I don't know.

729
00:41:56,454 --> 00:41:57,740
You - okay.

730
00:41:58,946 --> 00:42:01,343
So, what exactly does that mean –
"I don't know"?

731
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:02,810
I don't know.

732
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:06,591
Okay. I mean, 'cause that's usually
the kind of thing you know.

733
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,273
I know.

734
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:09,769
So you don't know. Okay.

735
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:14,525
Um, will you excuse me for a minute, Marty?
- Sure.

736
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,861
And then he just takes off
out of nowhere at 7:30 at night.

737
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,500
Thank you, Thomas.
I'll need a napkin.

738
