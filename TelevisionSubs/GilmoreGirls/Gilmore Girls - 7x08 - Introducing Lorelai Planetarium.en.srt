1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:02,571
It's me, and your father.
We're home.

2
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:04,578
I don't know if you forgot,
but we've been in Paris,

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,510
and we flew across oceans and
oceans just to see you again.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,213
And, so, we would really 
like to see you again --

5
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:14,172
today, tonight, A.S.A.P., okay?

6
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,722
So please call me.
Call me back.

7
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:20,902
S.T.A.S.A.P --
sooner than as soon as possible.

8
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:23,920
Okay, honey, call me.
Call me. Call me.

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,316
Call. Okay. Bye.

10
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:27,800
Okay, that was your last one.
I'm cutting you off.

11
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:29,915
She will call you
when she wakes up.

12
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:32,009
Now sit.

13
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,751
I need an open mind.
Are you giving me an open mind?

14
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:37,743
Okay, it's open.

15
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:38,583
Wide open?

16
00:00:38,596 --> 00:00:42,440
Yeah, yeah, blue skies, green grass,
vistas as far as the eye can see.

17
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:44,603
Good, because I want
you to picture,

18
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:46,430
on this wall,

19
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:47,910
a waterfall.

20
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:50,931
You know, one of those wall waterfalls--
they're really soothing.

21
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:52,222
- Slam --
- What?

22
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:53,820
The sound of my mind closing.

23
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:55,943
Come on. We could get 
a barcalounger right here

24
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:58,231
and just lean back and listen--
it'd be like living in Hawaii.

25
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,230
Are you serious--
a barcalounger?

26
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:02,621
Soft leather, button back pad
adjustable footrest.

27
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:03,902
You know what else
would be awesome?

28
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:05,562
Not having a barcalounger?

29
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:08,340
Flat-screen TV here--
high def, day and night.

30
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:09,813
You know what else might work?

31
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:12,133
One of those electronic fish--
what do they call it? --

32
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:13,560
the big-mouth billy bass.

33
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:15,023
You know what they are, right?
When somebody walks by,

34
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:17,343
they flap their mouths
and sing songs like

35
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:19,621
"Don't worry,
be happy" and "Take me to the river."

36
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:22,461
You're kidding.

37
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,512
I'm totally kidding, except for the
flat-screen. We need a flat-screen.

38
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:28,423
No! I'd rather have the
big-mouth billy bass fish.

39
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:29,461
What's wrong with
the flat-screen?

40
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:32,561
It's so "meet Georges Jetson,
his boy, Elroy" -- Leroy?

41
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:34,351
Elroy -- and it's not.

42
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:37,003
Look, I'm all for
small-town charm.

43
00:01:37,017 --> 00:01:39,760
I'm happy to move here,
sit out on the front porch,

44
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:41,823
and give the mailman a
real chipper "howdy-do."

45
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:43,492
- Don't you dare.
- But there's a line.

46
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:45,922
I'm not gonna cobble my own shoes,
churn butter,

47
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:48,092
or watch a TV from 1976.

48
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:51,760
What? This baby has a remote
that has 19 buttons on it.

49
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:53,260
You do have running water,
don't you?

50
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:54,252
Hardy Har Har.

51
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:56,501
Oh, you can say "hardy Har Har,"
but I can't say "howdy-do"?

52
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:57,560
Life's not fair.

53
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:00,160
What's your problem with a giant
flat-screen? I mean, you love TV.

54
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:01,572
Yeah! But just because
I love something

55
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:03,682
doesn't mean I want
it to be giant.

56
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:05,321
I love grapes, you know,

57
00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:07,911
but I don't want to sit down
and eat one humongous--

58
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,252
No, that would be fun.

59
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:10,682
Hello?

60
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,243
Hey. Welcome home.

61
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:14,533
Finally! I have been
calling and calling.

62
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:16,423
Yes, I know, since 5:00 a.m.

63
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,373
Well, that's noon
parisian time.

64
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:19,961
Well, then you should call
your parisian daughter

65
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:21,763
because your american
one was asleep.

66
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:23,660
- Hi, honey.
- Your dad says hi.

67
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,513
Hi dad, how was the trip?

68
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,600
Tonight. I'll tell you everything
when you come for dinner tonight.

69
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,773
I can't come tonight.

70
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:31,202
What? You have to.

71
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,362
I have a study group.

72
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,740
My major english quotes
professor's trying to kill me.

73
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:37,020
Well, all the more reason
to stay away from him.

74
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:38,893
Seriously, he sounds dangerous.

75
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:40,153
I'll  come over the weekend.

76
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,033
No, Rory, it has to be tonight.

77
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,143
Why?

78
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:46,230
Uh... s-snails.

79
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:47,371
Snails?

80
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:50,823
W-We --
your dad and I brought back snails.

81
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:51,990
For eating?

82
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:55,820
Yes, and if we don't
cook them tonight,

83
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:57,400
they'll go bad.

84
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,333
Mom.

85
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,910
Well, it's true.

86
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:02,280
It has to be tonight. Please.

87
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,413
- Fine. I'll be there.
- Good!

88
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:06,682
I'm going back to bed.

89
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:09,760
Oh, what? At 1:00 in the afternoon?
Lazy girl.

90
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:11,390
My parisian daughter's
such a go-getter.

91
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,853
She's been up and
around for hours.

92
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:13,912
See you tonight.

93
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,820
All right, she's coming.

94
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:17,863
Snails?

95
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:21,451
Well, I just --
as long as she's coming.

96
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,533
So you said snails?

97
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:24,223
Well, I had to say something.

98
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:26,313
Well, at least we
have a plan now.

99
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:28,520
We'll sit her down in the kitchen,
feed her snails,

100
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:30,510
and tell her we got married.

101
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:32,143
Oh, my god.

102
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,462
I just hate that
she doesn't know.

103
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:36,522
She's gonna know tonight
when we tell her.

104
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:37,873
Yeah.

105
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:39,870
- Lor?
- Yeah.

106
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,250
She's gonna be happy.

107
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:44,090
Her parents just got married.
It's the dream.

108
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,671
Yeah.

109
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:48,312
Maybe I should tell
her by myself.

110
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,390
Together -- we agreed.
We're gonna tell her together.

111
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,811
Yeah,  no, you're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

112
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,201
I'm just so used to it
just being me and her.

113
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:56,120
I'll feel better
when she knows.

114
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,932
Well, she'll know tonight
when we tell her...

115
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,441
- Yeah.
- ...with snails.

116
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,271
Now we have to get snails.

117
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:02,931
- We'll find snails.
- Where do you get snails?

118
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,280
- Maybe Doose's has snails.
- Doose's doesn't have snails.

119
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:07,972
Well, then, we'll go 
to a snail store -- emporium.

120
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,011
We'll find snails.

121
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,332
And a recipe.

122
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:12,921
They will have a recipe
at the snail emporium.

123
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,110
- Really?
- Yeah.

124
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:14,972
All right.

125
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:10,010
So you really liked 
the chamber music?

126
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:11,862
The part I was
awake for, anyway.

127
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,761
And then, after that,
we went to see a basketball game.

128
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:16,171
Slightly less obscure.

129
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:18,941
Yeah, right? A lot of people seem
to be into the sports thing.

130
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:21,872
And I can see why --
the fastpace, the school spirit.

131
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:22,961
You liked it?

132
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:24,992
Again, the part
I was awake for.

133
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:27,282
Wow, a real
basketball fan, huh?

134
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:31,352
Ah! Oh, my god!

135
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,842
What  is wrong with you!

136
00:05:35,855 --> 00:05:36,931
You're not happy to see me.

137
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:39,441
Well, of course I am,
but why do you insist

138
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,631
on scaring me half to death
every time you're in town?

139
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,293
Well, besides the fact
that it's really fun --

140
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:45,373
well, actually, that's it.
It's just really fun.

141
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:48,791
Oh man. Just once, you could call
me and tell me you're coming home,

142
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:49,981
like a normal person.

143
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:51,710
Normal's borring.
Normal's overrated.

144
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:53,385
Normal's not why you love me.

145
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:56,289
So, what's going on?
Why are you here?

146
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:58,601
You know that space we've been
trying to book for our launch party?

147
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,822
- The Orchid room.
- Yeah.

148
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:02,101
The problem is,
it's booked till 2008,

149
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:04,800
or it was until Nadine Maybrooke
broke up with Jamie Erman,

150
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:07,530
thus canceling their engagement party
and freeing the space up tonight.

151
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,073
Poor Nadine and Jamie.

152
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:11,110
Hey, I invited them.
The more the merrier.

153
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:12,121
So, it's gonna be huge.

154
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:13,771
So, you're having your
launch party tonight.

155
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:16,011
Well, actually,
it's our prelaunch launch party.

156
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:18,752
Our launch party will take
more than 48 hours to plan.

157
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,480
It starts at 9:00.
You can be there, right?

158
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:22,280
Oh yeah,
I'm having dinner with my parents,

159
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,930
but I can stop by right after.

160
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:25,240
When did they get
back from France?

161
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:28,192
Last night. I would juste skip it,
but my mom really wants to see me

162
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,262
and, apparently,
make me snails.

163
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:33,293
Okay. Well, then,
I guess I'll see you post-snails.

164
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:36,511
It should be a pretty good time.
We've got a huge guest list.

165
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,091
Bobbi's pulled
out all the stops.

166
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:41,563
She's contracted five of the
hottest P.R. agents in the city

167
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:43,672
and has them hunkered
in a war room.

168
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,741
I'd be surprised if she lets
them take bathroom breaks.

169
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:47,032
You can't stop Bobbi.

170
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:47,861
Ace.

171
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:49,761
What? No, I like Bobbi. I do.

172
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:52,341
I don't like the fact that
she's not a big, swarthy dude.

173
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:55,671
But I recognize that my issues with
Bobbi have nothing to do with her.

174
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,980
She's lovely.
She's your colleague.

175
00:06:57,998 --> 00:06:59,690
It doesn't matter that her
legs come up to my nose.

176
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:01,091
"A big, swarthy dude"?

177
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:02,451
With a cheesy goatee.

178
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:04,303
Well, maybe she'll
agree to the goatee.

179
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:07,731
And, hey, you want to come with me
tomorrow and check out apartments?

180
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:10,001
Apartments? Like, to live in?

181
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:13,071
I know it is clich�, but, yes,
I intend to live in my apartment.

182
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:14,181
In Manhattan?

183
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:16,151
Unless I strike you as
Staten Island kind of guy.

184
00:07:16,157 --> 00:07:17,911
- You're moving to New York.
- Pretty much.

185
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:19,332
Which is an hour away?

186
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:20,770
Actually, an hour
and 20 minutes.

187
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:22,821
That's so much
closer than London!

188
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,453
You've been brushing
up on your geography?

189
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,801
No, I just can't believe it.
I mean, it's huge.

190
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,652
It's amazing. I --

191
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,431
Are you happy?

192
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:31,151
I'm so happy!

193
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:33,221
Come on.
Let's get something to drink.

194
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,903
But why do you have to
get your own apartment?

195
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:36,371
Why can't you just
live here with me?

196
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:39,311
I'd love to, Ace, but I think I'd
end up seeing more of the I-95

197
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,500
than I would of you.
I mean, my hours are gonna be crazy.

198
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:44,252
If I live near the office,
I can crawl home at 3:00 in the morning

199
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:46,341
- and crawl back to work at 7:00.
- It's a lot of crawling.

200
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:48,560
It just doesn't make
sense logistically.

201
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:50,371
So it's just gonna be me here?

202
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,021
Well, you were gonna live
here by yourself anyway.

203
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,310
I know, but if you're gonna
have your whole new apartment,

204
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:56,393
then you're gonna
need all your stuff.

205
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:58,162
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna clean you out, Ace.

206
00:07:58,198 --> 00:07:59,431
I'll be fine. Take your stuff.

207
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,991
It's not gonna happened.
New apartment, new stuff.

208
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:01,903
Really?

209
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,202
Yeah.  I-I want a fresh start.

210
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:06,283
Hey, well,
you should take some of your stuff,

211
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:07,522
like your favorite stuff.

212
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:08,570
Like what?

213
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:12,021
Like, you know, you can't live
without your suit of armor, can you?

214
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:13,600
I mean,
you really want to take that.

215
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:14,841
You don't like Henry?

216
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:18,013
Well, it's not that I don't like him.
It's just that he creeps me out.

217
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:19,882
Oh man,
now you just hurt Henry's feelings.

218
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,332
Well, he's gonna have to grow a
little tougher chain mail then

219
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,620
if he's gonna make it on the
mean streets of New York.

220
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:26,382
You're heartless, Gilmore.

221
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,403
You hungry?

222
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,592
You want some juice?

223
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:31,853
Notice my hair is green?

224
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,910
- Uh, hey?
- Diner's ready.

225
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:34,820
Five more minutes?

226
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:36,580
After dinner --
wash your hands.

227
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,113
What's so interesting, anyway?

228
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:40,312
Hyperphagia.

229
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,023
Oh, right. Cool.

230
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:44,453
That's just a fancy
term for overeating.

231
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:46,392
It's what bears do in
preparation for hibernation.

232
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,933
Oh hey, did I tell you about the time
I saw a grizzly bear on a camping trip?

233
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:51,691
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. 500 pounds, easy.

234
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:54,493
Turkey burgers,
sweet potato fries, broccoli.

235
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:56,521
Thanks. So, what did you do?

236
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,431
Just backed away real slow,
avoided eye contact --

237
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,093
that's how you show
you're submissive.

238
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:01,920
Really?

239
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:03,413
Yeah, it's all
about body language.

240
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,552
And you've got to
try to stay calm.

241
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:07,203
Were you?

242
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:08,553
No.

243
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:12,803
I forgot to tell you what happened
with Rachel at school today.

244
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,123
Did she apologize to Melissa?
Are they talking again?

245
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,651
Yeah, but they won't be as
soon as Melissa finds out

246
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:19,620
that Rachel asked Joanna to
come with her to Florida

247
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:21,113
to visit her grandparents.

248
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:23,171
Hey, did you remember
to wash my jean skirt?

249
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,522
It's hanging in the bathroom.

250
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,393
Cool. I want to wear
it to Sabrina's party.

251
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:28,282
I was going to wear
that purple dress,

252
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:31,722
but last time I wore it,
Adam called me "purple Nardini" all day.

253
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,551
Yeah, it's a pretty
uninspired insult,

254
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,600
but the way he said
it was so annoying.

255
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:38,730
And now,
since he knows it bugs me,

256
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:41,553
he's probably just gonna
keep saying it all night.

257
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:43,071
"All night"?

258
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:44,131
At Sabrina's party.

259
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,481
Why would Adam be at her party?

260
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:48,562
Because he was invited.

261
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:50,220
To Sabrina's birthday?

262
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:51,412
Well, yeah.

263
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,392
- Sabrina's a girl, right?
- Yeah.

264
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:55,083
- And Adam's a boy?
- Yeah.

265
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:57,033
And he'll be at her party?

266
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:58,673
Yeah, it's a boy-girl party.

267
00:09:58,686 --> 00:09:59,982
What's that mean?

268
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:02,981
It means there will
both be boys...

269
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:04,891
and girls at the party.

270
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:05,780
Yeah. All right.

271
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:08,683
I just didn't know you were going
to boy-girl parties. That's all.

272
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:09,971
It's my first one.

273
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:11,783
I only got invited
'cause Sabrina's parents

274
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:13,771
made her invite
the whole class.

275
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,873
But I'm not about to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

276
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:19,500
So, you're mom's okay with
you going to a boy-girl party?

277
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,293
Of course. I'm 13.

278
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:23,992
So, um, listen.

279
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:26,522
This is probably a
stupid question, but...

280
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:29,592
is there gonna be 
kissing at this party?

281
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:31,570
Okay! Ew, dad!

282
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:32,922
- What?
- Oh, gross!

283
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:34,022
What's gross-- kissing?

284
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:36,492
No, you talking about kissing.

285
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,420
What? All right, all right,
I won't say "kissing."

286
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,691
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!
Stop! Stop!

287
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:44,343
All right! All right! I'm not saying
it at all. Done -- new topic.

288
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:47,072
I promise.

289
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:52,360
-  The fries are really good.
- Good.

290
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,641
Good. Then eat your
broccoli, too.

291
00:10:58,327 --> 00:10:59,670
Hello?!

292
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,121
Honey!

293
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:03,110
Oh, hi!

294
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,021
And that's how we do
it on the continent.

295
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:06,152
But of course. Hey, dad.

296
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:07,442
Hi, honey.

297
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:09,181
Come on. Come in! Come in!

298
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:10,862
Okay. What are you wearing?

299
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,752
I hear it's called an apron.

300
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:14,323
Interesting. Why are
you wearing that?

301
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:16,590
- Because I've been cooking snails.
- You're kidding me.

302
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:18,563
And cooking snails
and dealing with snail spatter.

303
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:19,872
- She really cook those?
- She did.

304
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:21,253
What do you mean?
I told you I was gonna cook them.

305
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:23,533
Yeah, but I thought it was just
something you say, like a euphemism.

306
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:24,420
A euphemism for what?

307
00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:25,941
A euphemism for "I'm
ordering a pizza."

308
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,500
Come on, sit, sit.

309
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:29,511
So, how was your trip?

310
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:32,380
Oh, no.
First, a glass of wine --

311
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:34,772
we went to the chateau du
Nozet in the Loire valley,

312
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:36,551
and this is Pouilly fum�.

313
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,843
It's supposed to be one
of the best in the land,

314
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:41,880
and after trying 10 varietals--
note the use of "varietal"...

315
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:42,533
Noted.

316
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:44,452
...believe me,
you tend to believe them.

317
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:46,790
We were drunk by the end of the tour.
We bought a case.

318
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,633
Cool. So you went to a winery?
What else. What else did you do?

319
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:52,632
Um, here.

320
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:54,521
Try a snail.

321
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:55,703
Uh, no.

322
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,280
Please? Come on. I made them.

323
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:58,033
You try one.

324
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:00,333
I'm full.
I've been snacking on them all day.

325
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:03,410
Well, see, I had a lunch of bugs
and lizards, so I'm good, too.

326
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,320
All right, I'll try one.

327
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:07,340
You sure you don't want
a lime and some salt

328
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:09,133
so you can do it
like a tequila shot?

329
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:10,682
I'm good.

330
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,020
All right, you ready?

331
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:14,361
One, two...

332
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:18,443
- Well, how's it taste?
- Well?

333
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,983
Sort of like a
buttered gummi bear.

334
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:21,062
Pass.

335
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:23,731
So, whatelse?
Tell me -- France.

336
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:26,531
Okay, here it is.

337
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:33,550
While we were in France,
your dad and I --

338
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:35,430
we got married.

339
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:37,770
What?

340
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,183
We got married.

341
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:41,512
You got married married?

342
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,852
- Married married.
- Really?

343
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,392
Wow. Wow. Um...

344
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,231
Hey, congratulations.
T-That's-- That's so great.

345
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:55,133
Thanks. We're so excited.

346
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:58,192
Um, how? When?

347
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,973
Two days ago, in Giverny.

348
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,661
It's a little town about
an hour outside Paris.

349
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,852
It's where Monet had his studio,
where he painted the water lilies.

350
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:07,413
Oh, so you guys just went
there to get married?

351
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:11,361
Oh, no, we just went there to
walk around, to see the lilies.

352
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,702
And, um,
then it started raining,

353
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:17,701
and there was this little church,
and, uh...

354
00:13:17,718 --> 00:13:21,091
it was so beautiful,
and we were so happy,

355
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:23,431
and we got married.

356
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:24,651
Wow.

357
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:27,133
The ceremony was in french,
so there's only a 90% chance

358
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:28,940
that we're actually married.
There's a 10% chance

359
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,873
we were issued a very
expensive dog licence.

360
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:33,651
Wow.

361
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,981
Wow. Um...

362
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:38,820
Oh, I'm --
I'm so happy for you guys.

363
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:39,990
Really?

364
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:42,170
You know, we need champagne.
Do we have champagne?

365
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,742
Uh, in the cooler in
the garage, maybe.

366
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,952
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Okay!

367
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:53,903
Well?

368
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,143
What?

369
00:13:56,156 --> 00:13:57,271
What do you think?

370
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:58,763
Um, what do you mean?

371
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:00,672
I mean, what do you think?

372
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,913
I don't know, mom.

373
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,302
I can't believe
that you did this.

374
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:07,540
- You're mad?
- Yes, I'm mad.

375
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,743
- Rory...
- Just stop, okay? Don't.

376
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:11,622
- Okay, but --
- I can't do this right now.

377
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:15,451
Because dad is about to come
back in here, and I just can't.

378
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:16,983
Okay.

379
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:20,491
Unfortunately, we went
all the way to France

380
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:22,383
and didn't come back with
a bottle of champagne,

381
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,231
so we're gonna have to make
do with California's finest.

382
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:26,812
It's okay.

383
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:35,973
And she showed me her ring, 
this huge canary diamond.

384
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:38,391
Looked like something
Paris Hilton would wear.

385
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:40,192
- Hey, you made it.
- I made it.

386
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,233
You look beautiful.

387
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,930
How was the diner?
Did your mom really make snails?

388
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,151
Not only did she make snails,
she got married.

389
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:47,003
- What?
- In France-- to my dad.

390
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,100
- Wow.
- Yeah.

391
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:49,531
-  Wow!
- I know.

392
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:50,700
How do you feel about it?

393
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:52,733
You mean besides really bad?

394
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:54,003
Do you want a drink?

395
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:55,410
No, I'm good for now.

396
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:56,831
Let's go outside
and talk about it.

397
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,362
No, I'm okay.
I mean, I will want to talk about it,

398
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:00,802
but right now I'm
still processing.

399
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:03,472
Well, it's a lot to process.
Don't feel like you have to stay

400
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:04,960
- if you don't want to.
- Oh, no. I want to be here.

401
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:06,631
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

402
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:09,703
Little-known fact --
I am quite the compartmentalizer.

403
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:12,553
In fact, I have a blister on my heel.
I've been ignoring it all evening.

404
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:14,631
All right. Well, if you change your
mind, you want to talk about it...

405
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,641
I'm fine. This is your night.

406
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:17,681
So how can I help?

407
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:19,811
Just be your charming,
blister-ignoring self.

408
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:22,621
I can do that. So, who's here?
Or, rather, who's not here?

409
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:24,041
We got a pretty
good turnout, huh?

410
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:24,651
Yeah.

411
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,421
All right, see that guy right there?
He's a Rockefeller.

412
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,181
He doesn't like you to talk about
the fact that he's a Rockefeller,

413
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:30,241
but we wants you to know he's a
Rockefeller, so if you talk to him,

414
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:32,421
make sure he knows you know,
but don't say you know.

415
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:34,502
I'm gonna try to work in
the phrase "Standard Oil."

416
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,151
Behind us --
Boykin and his fianc�e, Celery.

417
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,043
And, no, I'm not kidding.
Those are their real names.

418
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:42,402
"Meet my boyfriend, Boykin."
Try saying that five times fast.

419
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,263
- Rory, you made it!
- Yeah.

420
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,441
Hey.

421
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:47,470
- Hey, Rory.
- Hi.

422
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:49,693
Oh, you look beautiful,
absolutely beautiful.

423
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:51,500
Careful, man, you're drooling.

424
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,323
How are things at Yale? Only six months
until you're sprung free, right?

425
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:56,782
Yeah. Don't remind me.
I'm so not ready to be sprung.

426
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,663
Stop to be brilliant.
Can I get you a drink?

427
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:00,201
- Oh, thanks.
- I'll be right back.

428
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:02,433
- Hello, Rory, darling.
- Hi.

429
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:06,070
I'm so happy you made it.
That dress is so cute.

430
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:09,062
Oh, thanks.
Um, your dress is cute, too.

431
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:10,212
Thank you, sweetheart.

432
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:11,931
So, bit of exciting news--

433
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:13,293
"Page Six" is here.

434
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,432
Really?

435
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:16,133
Wow. Congratulations.

436
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:17,832
- It's all Bobbi.
- Oh, rubbish.

437
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:21,300
Oh, before I forget, you sent a
case of champagne to Joe McMillan.

438
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,801
His website's trash,
but we need him to write

439
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:24,873
- something smashing about us.
- Sounds good.

440
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,602
Oscar Schroeder's limo didn't show.
I've got to find him another one.

441
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:30,522
The gentleman can't be expected
to walk three whole blocks.

442
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,990
Ooh, Tripp Cavanaugh?

443
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:35,260
Tripp! Hey, man,
glad you could make it.

444
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,283
- Bobbi, you know Tripp.
- Hi, sweetheart.

445
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,321
And this is my girlfriend,
Rory Gilmore.

446
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,300
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

447
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:48,373
Tripp's just back from Tortola.

448
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:49,853
He's building an
incredible house there.

449
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:50,773
Wow, congratulations.

450
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:53,093
Well, we'll see. Construction
on the island is such a joke.

451
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,251
I mean,
try getting anyone to meet a schedule.

452
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,283
Yeah, I've heard that.

453
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:58,122
Plus, my property's
totally isolated,

454
00:16:58,137 --> 00:16:59,391
which will be great once
the house is built,

455
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:01,443
but it's a
construction nightmare.

456
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:03,973
Turns out,
the bridge that accesses my land

457
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:05,680
can't take the weight of the
truck carrying the supplies.

458
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:08,003
We had to off-load the supplies
onto a smaller vehicle.

459
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:09,560
That necessited
two fork-lifts.

460
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,282
None of this is covered 
in the estimate, of course.

461
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:12,180
It never is.

462
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,163
Anyway, so we finally got
the materials -- finally.

463
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:16,290
Oh, great.

464
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:18,352
Yeah. Unfortunately,
that's when the real trouble began.

465
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:21,043
Without consulting me, they decided
to move the pool over 10 feet

466
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,160
'cause the excavation crew needed
more room for their equipment.

467
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:24,273
Of course, I flip.

468
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:27,120
Who ever heard of a pool right
in the middle of the backyard?

469
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,713
Well, not me.

470
00:17:29,057 --> 00:17:31,572
I told them that was unacceptable
and they'd had to move.

471
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,831
Can I get a picture
of you guys?

472
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,192
Absolutely.

473
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:36,641
I've got correct
names and spellings.

474
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,470
- Where was I?
- Your pool.

475
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:40,973
Oh right. So we shifted the
thing back 10 feet, thank God,

476
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,643
but when they started
digging in the right place,

477
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:44,420
we found out that
the soil in Tortola

478
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:46,250
is far more porous than
we initially thought.

479
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,440
- Oh, god.
- Bummer.

480
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,452
Yeah, bummer, that's right.
So we had to lay down a drainage sysm.

481
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:50,622
At least, that was the plan.

482
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:53,543
But it turnes out that Tortola have
these building codes that specifically --

483
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:55,073
Tripp, have you
met Natasha Wolfe?

484
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:56,252
No, I don't think so.

485
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:57,812
Oh, God, you have to meet her.

486
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,740
She has a house in Tortola, as well.
Come come.

487
00:17:59,756 --> 00:18:01,062
- Oh, will you excuse me?
- Absolutely.

488
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,542
Nice meeting you.

489
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,893
Um, can we please
never go to Tortola?

490
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:06,260
I don't even want to
meet John Turturro.

491
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:07,470
Or eat tortellini.

492
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,380
Hey, you'll actually
like this guy.

493
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:11,552
Hugo.

494
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:13,001
Logan. Hey. How you doing, man?

495
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:14,980
Not too bad.
This is my girlfriend, Rory Gilmore.

496
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:16,370
Hey, Hugo Grey,
nice to meet you.

497
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:16,983
You too.

498
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:19,603
Hugo spent two years working at the New
York Times, another couple at Slate,

499
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:21,512
and then the Paris review
under George Plimpton.

500
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:23,300
Wow. Did you just
worship at his feet?

501
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,961
I tried, but he kept telling
me to get off the ground.

502
00:18:25,978 --> 00:18:28,683
Hugo's starting a new online 
magazine -- lots of buzz.

503
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:30,951
- It could mean nothing.
- Could mean something.

504
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,052
See why I like this guy?

505
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,432
You don't have to convince me.

506
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,461
Rory's the editor of
the Yale Daily News.

507
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:39,080
I was the editor. I just abdicated my
throne-- or, rather, my swivel chair.

508
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:40,120
That's impressive.

509
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:41,800
Your drink --
sorry it got waylaid.

510
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:43,621
I need your help, buddy.
Dan Cryer's about one drink away

511
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:45,381
from hitting on
Jerrickson's wife.

512
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:48,103
That would be bad. Excuse me.

513
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,933
I'm gonna monopolize you a little
bit longer if you don't mind.

514
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:53,443
Once you find somebody that can talk
about something other than stock quotes

515
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:55,600
at one of these things,
you hold on for dear life.

516
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,101
Oh God, I know what you mean.

517
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:59,231
It's pretty different
from parties at Yale?

518
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:01,870
Fewer drunken musing
on Roland Barthes.

519
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,221
Although, on the plus side,
I am learning a great deal

520
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:06,593
about the tackiness of
the canary diamond.

521
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,473
They're not teaching
that these days?

522
00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:11,541
Tell me they at least have a
course in piloting the family jet.

523
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:12,680
Sadly, no.

524
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,671
Man. No wonder we're
falling behind the japanese.

525
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,221
Is it the chinese now?

526
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:19,171
We're definitely
falling behind someone.

527
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,393
So, what kind of pieces
you write at Yale?

528
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:23,802
A little bit of everything. That's
the great thing about being editor --

529
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:25,711
you can pretty much give
yourself the best pieces.

530
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,142
I got to interview Barack
Obama a couple weeks ago.

531
00:19:28,156 --> 00:19:30,073
- He came to speak at campus.
- Really?

532
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:32,400
Did you ask your buddy Barack
if he's gonna run in 2008?

533
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,722
What kind of journalist
would I be if I didn't?

534
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:35,713
And?

535
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:37,521
Standard answer --
"no current plans."

536
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:38,992
But I saw a twinkle in his eye.

537
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:40,513
Well, you can't
quote a twinkle.

538
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:41,962
But you can describe it.

539
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:43,612
Good point.

540
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:45,560
Hey, listen. If you want to
submit something to my site,

541
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,140
I'd be happy to
take a look at it.

542
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:50,453
Really? Wow, that would be great.
What kind of pieces are you looking for?

543
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,272
Cultural and
social observations.

544
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:55,050
We're sort of Slate meets New
York Times' "lifestyle" section,

545
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,693
before they sold out.

546
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,200
You can definitely write
about a party like this.

547
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:58,830
Really?

548
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,972
I got Cryer talking golf --
disaster averted.

549
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:02,241
Good job.

550
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:04,070
I've got to take off, man.
I got an early morning.

551
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:06,452
All right, man. Thanks a lot for
coming out. I really appreciated.

552
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:07,683
No, thank you.
It was nice to meet you, Rory.

553
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,750
- You too.
- And here's my card.

554
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,051
- There you go.
- Thanks.

555
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:12,440
- Bye, I'll see you guys around.
- Bye.

556
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,412
Thanks. Look at you,
getting a card.

557
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:16,312
I know. He said 
I should submit a piece for him,

558
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:17,521
like something
about this party.

559
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:18,623
Seriously? You have to do it.

560
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:19,822
I know. I am.

561
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:22,242
Logan, Rory,
I am so sorry I got pulled away.

562
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,630
Natasha Wolfe actually has a house
on another one of the beef islands.

563
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:28,493
Not Tortola. Still, she had an interesting 
experience when she was building...

564
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:31,160
Okay, I'm just gonna leave
you one more message,

565
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,700
and then I'm gonna
start sending telegrams.

566
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:40,371
Honey, I know you think this
marriage was a big step, and...

567
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:44,292
and it seems impulsive to you,
and we talked about going slow,

568
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:47,023
and this seems like
the opposite of slow.

569
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:48,690
And, in some ways, it is.

570
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,170
And, in some ways,
it really isn't.

571
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:55,642
And I really want to
talk to you about it.

572
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:58,940
So, please, call me back...

573
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:03,443
or respond to any of my
forthcoming telegrams.

574
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:05,590
Okay. Bye-bye.

575
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,692
I don't know,
I think the piece is good.

576
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:14,191
I was just on a roll.
You know, I mean, I was hopped up.

577
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,170
I couldn't sleep.
I was just way too excited,

578
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:19,363
and I drank way too much coffee--
way too much coffee.

579
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:22,803
Oh, I should really stop talking
and let you finish reading.

580
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:25,990
One new message.

581
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:28,253
Okay, I'm just gonna leave
you one more message --

582
00:21:32,187 --> 00:21:33,483
So...

583
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:37,163
What do you think?

584
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:43,962
I don't know what to say.

585
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:47,331
Oh, I know the ending is a
little convoluted, but I --

586
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:50,341
It's not convoluted.
You made your feelings perfectly clear.

587
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:51,711
What do you mean?

588
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,710
Just that it must have been
really hard for you at my party,

589
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,020
surrounded by all those people with --
how do you put it?

590
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:57,802
"Who can no more imagine a
world without trust funds

591
00:21:57,836 --> 00:21:59,983
than a world without water --
imported and bubbly, of course."

592
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,763
Oh, no,
that was meant to be funny--

593
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,362
It sounds like it was torturous,
being stuck there

594
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:05,610
with "these overprivileged sons
and daughters of somebodies

595
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:08,422
who fail to grasp how out of
touch they seem to those of us

596
00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:10,540
who don't have an errant
domestic employee

597
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:12,911
or a construction
problem on beef island."

598
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:14,872
- You're mad?
- You're damn right I'm mad.

599
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:17,183
But you were making fun of
these people all night.

600
00:22:17,198 --> 00:22:19,561
I was joking. I wasn't standing
there judging everyone.

601
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:20,901
I didn't judge everyone.

602
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:23,312
The title of your article
is "Let them drink cosmos."

603
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:24,952
I was joking around with my girlfriend.
I wasn't comparing

604
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:27,022
a whole class of people
to Marie Antoinette.

605
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:29,931
I'm so sorry. I really didn't
think that this would upset you.

606
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,250
You didn't think
it would upset me?

607
00:22:31,286 --> 00:22:33,920
No. No, I was just writing.
I mean, I was worked up.

608
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,960
I was mad at my mom. Maybe that
kind of got into the piece somehow.

609
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:38,472
But, no,
this was meant to be funny.

610
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,673
I didn't think you would
take it personally.

611
00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:42,461
I mean, you're totally
different from these people.

612
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,433
No, I'm not, and you know what?
I don't want to be.

613
00:22:44,465 --> 00:22:45,172
Logan.

614
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:47,761
What? I'm a rich trust-fund kid.
I'm not ashamed of it.

615
00:22:47,775 --> 00:22:50,480
No, and you shouldn't be.
That's not what I meant.

616
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,730
I mean, my point,
or the point I was trying to make

617
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,091
was that people use
connections to get ahead.

618
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,843
Oh, give me a break. You act like making
connections is something nefarious.

619
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,300
It's not.
It's just people meeting people.

620
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:02,351
Well, it's certain people
meeting certain people.

621
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:04,071
It's not like anyone's
meeting Joe bus driver.

622
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:06,413
- And you're Joe bus driver.
- Well, no, but --

623
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,400
Exactly. Where do you get off
acting all morally superior?

624
00:23:09,418 --> 00:23:11,860
That is not what I
intended to say at all.

625
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:13,790
You clearly think you are. Why?

626
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:16,810
Because you read "Ironweed"?
'Cause you saw "Norma Rae"?

627
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,440
Wake up, whether you like it or not,
you're one of us.

628
00:23:19,455 --> 00:23:22,120
You went to prep school.
You go to Yale.

629
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:24,901
Your grandparents are building a whole
damn astronomy building in your name.

630
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,410
That is different, okay? It's not like
I live off a $5-million trust fund

631
00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:29,692
my parents set up for me.

632
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:32,100
Well, you're not exactly
paying rent, either.

633
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:36,941
Screw you, Logan.

634
00:23:42,476 --> 00:23:44,060
So, you're getting ready
for the party, huh?

635
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:44,691
Yep.

636
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:46,350
I can get you some
real wrapping paper.

637
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,903
Did you not see "An
inconvenient truth"?

638
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,823
Are you okay?

639
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,252
Yeah, I just have a little stomachache,
that's all.

640
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:56,030
Okay, what do you think? I put this
article on darfur on the front,

641
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:58,541
to put things in perspective in
case Sabrina doesn't like the CD

642
00:23:58,578 --> 00:24:00,340
- that I picked out for her.
- It looks pretty good.

643
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,552
So, I wanted to talk
to you about tonight.

644
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,833
Hey, are you sure you're okay?
Maybe you should get something to eat.

645
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:09,181
I'm not hungry.
Hand me the tape, please.

646
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:10,832
Sweetie, you don't
look so good.

647
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:12,812
That's not a nice thing to say
to someone who's on her way

648
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:14,212
to her first boy-girl party.

649
00:24:14,228 --> 00:24:16,361
- Oh yeah. Sorry.
- Tape, please?

650
00:24:16,376 --> 00:24:17,943
So, look, about the party.

651
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:18,911
Yeah?

652
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:22,412
I want to talk to you about that thing
we were talking about the other night.

653
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:24,401
I'm not gonna use
the "k" word, okay?

654
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:27,640
Instead, I'll just
use "juggling," okay?

655
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:29,350
- "Juggling"?
- Juggling.

656
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:30,170
Okay.

657
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:32,373
Okay, so here's the thing.

658
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:36,463
Even if all the other
kids are juggling

659
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:39,493
and you might feel like
you want to juggle, too,

660
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:43,370
I don't think you should
juggle before you're ready.

661
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:44,202
I know.

662
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:46,132
And I don't think you're ready.

663
00:24:46,147 --> 00:24:47,433
How do you know?

664
00:24:47,448 --> 00:24:49,691
Well, let's put it this way.
I'm not ready.

665
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:53,150
That seems kind of arbitrary,
since you're not the one doing it.

666
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,692
Yeah, it may be, but, still,

667
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:57,381
if I let you go to this party,
you have to promise me

668
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:01,703
that you won't
juggle with boys.

669
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,301
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

670
00:25:03,316 --> 00:25:05,162
Yes. Fine.

671
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:07,781
Okay.

672
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,162
Shoot, where'd I
put Sabrina's card?

673
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,320
Oh, there it is.

674
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:17,160
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

675
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:18,991
- I feel fine.
- Come here, let me feel your forehead.

676
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:20,743
I feel fine.

677
00:25:20,827 --> 00:25:22,923
April, you have a fever.

678
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:24,221
I swear, dad, I feel fine.

679
00:25:24,237 --> 00:25:26,733
Yeah, you can't go to
the party if you're sick.

680
00:25:26,747 --> 00:25:28,780
- I'm not sick!
- Yeah, you are, sweetie.

681
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,510
You're just saying that 'cause
you just don't want me to go!

682
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:32,822
- That's not true.
- It is! You don't trust me!

683
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:35,342
Of course I do.
Look, there will be other parties.

684
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:37,430
- No!
- I'm sorry, April. You're sick.

685
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,593
- I'm not!
- Yeah, you are, sweetie.

686
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:41,321
- I can go!
- No, you can't.

687
00:25:41,336 --> 00:25:43,202
You suck as a dad!

688
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:53,110
You have no messages.

689
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:55,382
I think this is the
last of the clothes.

690
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:56,320
Ah yeah?

691
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:57,613
Aah! Come here. What is that?

692
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,390
What?

693
00:25:58,838 --> 00:26:00,822
It's a shirt.
What's wrong with a shirt?

694
00:26:00,938 --> 00:26:02,760
Let's start with the color.
It's peach.

695
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:03,983
I look good in peach.

696
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,900
Exactly. Men who buy peach
shirts buy it 'cause they think

697
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:08,801
they look good in peach, which
means they really thought about it,

698
00:26:08,838 --> 00:26:10,611
which means they're
obsessed with their looks!

699
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:12,220
I'm not obsessed with my looks!

700
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,001
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you a peach shirt.

701
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:17,171
Oh, just leave my stuff alone.

702
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:21,242
- Oh, my god, you dirty thief.
- Excuse me?

703
00:26:21,257 --> 00:26:24,302
You stinking, lying,
stinking, ratty, dirty thief!

704
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:24,912
What?

705
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:27,981
This is my Police
"Synchronicity" t-shirt.

706
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:30,452
I have been missing
this for 22 years!

707
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:32,010
I asked you if you had it!

708
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:34,992
I looked you right in the face,
and you denied it!

709
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:36,270
I lied.

710
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:39,362
Oh, you lied! You lied!

711
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:41,773
Do you know how long
I looked for this?!

712
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:44,453
Days and days! And then I accused
my mother of throwing it out,

713
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:46,242
and she said she didn't, and,
oh, my god, I hated her.

714
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:48,231
Oh my god, I could have had the
best relationship with my mother

715
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:49,851
if you hadn't stolen my shirt.

716
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:52,423
Well, keep laughing, buddy,

717
00:26:52,435 --> 00:26:56,182
because, I'll tell you,
the laugh's on you now!

718
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,370
You better get used
to seeing this shirt,

719
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:01,533
because I have to make up for
22 years of not wearing it.

720
00:27:01,547 --> 00:27:02,601
Where do you think
you're going?

721
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:04,771
I'm dropping this stuff
off in Rory's room.

722
00:27:04,786 --> 00:27:06,430
Actually, I guess
it's G.G.'S room now.

723
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:08,132
Wow, that's weird, huh?

724
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:09,461
Really weird.

725
00:27:09,576 --> 00:27:12,222
A big sellingpoint -- the proximity
of this room to the kitchen.

726
00:27:12,238 --> 00:27:14,413
I don't know why, but G.G.
was incredibly psyched about that.

727
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:15,710
Why? You feed her, don't you?

728
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:17,273
I knew there was something
I was forgetting.

729
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:18,542
W-What are you doing?

730
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:20,961
I'm juste seeing how heavy it is. I thought 
maybe we could move it in the garage,

731
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:22,432
get G.G.'s coloring
table in here.

732
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:24,562
Yes, or we could just
leave it right here.

733
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:26,542
Nah, G.G.'s not gonna need
it for a couple years.

734
00:27:26,555 --> 00:27:27,722
Oh, you know what
I was thinking?

735
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,032
- Trundle beds.
- Trundle beds?

736
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,652
For when Rory comes to visit.

737
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:33,051
Uh, okay. Wait.
I'm sorry. Slow down.

738
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:34,332
Why?

739
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:40,221
I just -- I don't want to change Rory's
room all around without consulting her.

740
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:42,670
She's not gonna care. She's graduating
from college in the spring.

741
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,003
Right, and lots of college
graduates end up back home,

742
00:27:45,018 --> 00:27:46,802
where they need their desks.

743
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:47,562
Lor.

744
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,440
What? I'm just being
realistic, okay?

745
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:51,323
It's not like she's gonna be
an investment banker. You know.

746
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:53,892
She's gonna be a journalist,
and journalists get paid crap.

747
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:56,013
So, if she needs money,
we'll help her out.

748
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:57,310
Right. Okay. That's fine.

749
00:27:57,328 --> 00:28:00,722
But, still, why not just 
leave Rory's room as it is?

750
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:02,941
Give G.G.
something to aspire to.

751
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:06,183
Things worked out pretty well for Rory.
I mean, she went to Yale.

752
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:08,383
Lor...

753
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:10,190
Chris?

754
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,982
I know it's difficult,
but things around here are gonna change.

755
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,053
You think I don't know that?

756
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,481
I just, uh...

757
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:22,420
I don't want Rory to feel like the
rug's being pulled out from under her,

758
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:24,371
you know,
like she's being kicked out.

759
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:25,731
Rory's gonna be fine.

760
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,470
You don't know that.
She's already upset.

761
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:30,180
About what?

762
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:34,260
About you and me,
about the marriage.

763
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:36,343
She seemed fine
when we told her.

764
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:39,052
In front of you,
and then you left, and...

765
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,672
...she told me she
was really upset.

766
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,002
What? H-How could
you not tell me that?

767
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,590
Well, honey, I --

768
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:47,950
No, I'm her father, Lorelai.
We're married now.

769
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:50,232
Okay, well,
I'm telling you now.

770
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:53,741
Let's call her.
We should talk about it.

771
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:55,211
- I did.
- And?

772
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:58,541
And she's not
answering right now.

773
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:01,620
But it'll be okay, you know?
It'll be fine. It's just --

774
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:04,053
It's a sensitive thing,
and, uh...

775
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:07,950
and I-I just feel like
we should give it time,

776
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,483
you know, before 
we spring trundle beds on her.

777
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:13,222
Yeah, okay.

778
00:29:13,848 --> 00:29:16,371
I mean,
she just needs time to adjust.

779
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:19,502
- Okay.
- Okay?

780
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:25,292
There's a few more things I
got to bring in from the car.

781
00:29:40,885 --> 00:29:43,191
He's the one who insisted
I move in with him.

782
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:44,570
Begged me practically.

783
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:47,630
And now he throws it back in my face,
like I'm some kind of leech.

784
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:50,000
- That's such a low blow.
- So low.

785
00:29:50,018 --> 00:29:52,350
- I hate everyone today.
- Including us?

786
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:55,173
Well no, not you guys,
but don't cross me, sister.

787
00:29:55,188 --> 00:29:56,800
Keep reading, Liv.

788
00:29:56,818 --> 00:29:59,841
I'm practically homeless.
I mean, obviously, I can't live there.

789
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:01,200
You can move in with us.

790
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,022
- Is that allowed?
- Well, not technically.

791
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,351
But we have a hot plate, and we're
not allowed to have that either.

792
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,503
Will you finish reading that
article so I can read it?

793
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:08,823
Okay, okay.

794
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:10,440
Seriously, Rory,
you should just move in here with us.

795
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,601
We'll make a smaller common room.
We'll put up a temporary wall.

796
00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:14,853
You know how to do that?

797
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:17,001
I don't,
but boyfriend's super handy.

798
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,091
Oh, right.

799
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:21,501
He put up those bookshelves, and
they're fine for, you know, paperbacks.

800
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:23,250
You know what?
Don't worry about me.

801
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,420
You guys are taking enough of
a risk with that hot plate.

802
00:30:25,455 --> 00:30:26,693
I will figure something out.

803
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:27,763
Well, if you need to...

804
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:28,990
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

805
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:29,882
Here.

806
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:31,892
So, what did you think?

807
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:33,750
- It's a really great piece.
- You think?

808
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,820
- Yeah, you're an awesome writer.
- Thanks.

809
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:39,482
It was sharp and funny, and I could
totally see everything and
imagine everyone.

810
00:30:39,495 --> 00:30:41,303
Thanks. And it's
not mean, right?

811
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:42,623
No, no, it's mean.

812
00:30:42,637 --> 00:30:45,152
Yeah, it is mean,
and I'm only on the first paragraph.

813
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,541
Keep reading,
it get's meaner.

814
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:47,530
It's mean?

815
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,632
Sort of Lynn Hirshberg meets --

816
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:50,951
I don't know,
someone really mean.

817
00:30:50,988 --> 00:30:53,852
What? No!
No, I'm Fran Lebowitz.

818
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:55,901
It's supposed to
be fun, frothy,

819
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:58,590
lighthearted satire,
social anthropology.

820
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,800
I'm Tama Janowitz.

821
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,632
A mean Tama Janowitz.

822
00:31:01,647 --> 00:31:04,131
Oh, god. I'm mean?

823
00:31:04,147 --> 00:31:07,092
I'm mean and judgmental,
and I didn't even mean to be.

824
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:09,841
I was just trying to sell an article.
No wonder he's upset.

825
00:31:09,856 --> 00:31:12,343
Come on! He knows you.
It wasn't intentional.

826
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:14,450
That's worse!
I didn't even mean to be mean,

827
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:17,433
and I was mean.
Mean and judgmental and insensitive.

828
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:20,253
I really do hate everyone today,
including myself.

829
00:31:20,265 --> 00:31:22,641
Great. The circle's complete.

830
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:26,423
You sure you don't want some ginger ale?
It'll settle your stomach.

831
00:31:26,455 --> 00:31:29,731
- I feel fine.
- Okay.

832
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:32,353
How about a movie?
I could rent us a movie.

833
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:36,363
Come on, April.
Look, I know you're a little upset.

834
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:39,513
But, I promise you,
there will be other parties.

835
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:42,240
Come on, talk to me.

836
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:48,543
Wow! Okay,
you're really hot, sweetie.

837
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:50,543
Hang on a minute.

838
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:03,131
Hello?

839
00:32:03,148 --> 00:32:04,771
April's really sick,
and I don't know what to do.

840
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:07,481
She's got a fever, and it's her stomach.
And she's really pale, so--

841
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:09,133
Okay. Slow down.
Did she throw up?

842
00:32:09,148 --> 00:32:09,741
No.

843
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:10,900
Did she eat something bad?

844
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:12,661
No, she hasn't eaten
anything all day.

845
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:14,190
Aw, where does it hurt?

846
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,502
- She's holding her side.
- Which side?

847
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,583
Her right side.
It seems to be getting worse.

848
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:21,230
Oh, you know,
it could be appendicitis.

849
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:23,121
Appendicitis-- Really?

850
00:32:23,136 --> 00:32:26,382
Yeah, it's gonna be okay, but you should
take her right to the hospital, okay?

851
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:28,922
- Take her to St. Joseph's.
- Okay. Okay.

852
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,622
- We have five minutes left.
- No, we don't.

853
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:36,623
I checked my watch
before I fed the meter.

854
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:37,482
So did I.

855
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:39,183
You couldn't have.
Because we've got five minutes left.

856
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:40,223
No.

857
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:42,573
Five minutes have passed since you
started this inane conversation.

858
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:45,440
So if I were you, I'd put another
quarter in and call it a day!

859
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:47,631
You need to check
your watch battery.

860
00:32:47,645 --> 00:32:50,471
This is a quartz Timex.
You wind it.

861
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,163
Hey.

862
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:56,892
- Oh, hey.
- How is she?

863
00:32:56,906 --> 00:32:59,690
Okay. It was appendicitis,
like you said.

864
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:01,731
But she's okay.

865
00:33:01,745 --> 00:33:03,473
The operation went
really great.

866
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:06,233
They got it out, no problem.
And she's gonna be fine.

867
00:33:06,248 --> 00:33:07,723
And I'm gonna be able
to see her pretty soon.

868
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:09,762
- Good, good.
- Yeah.

869
00:33:09,775 --> 00:33:12,471
You didn't --
you know you didn't have to come,

870
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:14,442
but thanks for coming.

871
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,800
There's nothing worse than taking
your kid to the emergency room.

872
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:20,173
You know,
I remember Rory had food poisoning,

873
00:33:20,187 --> 00:33:21,702
and they had to hook
her up to an I.V.

874
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:24,993
and she just looked
so little and scared.

875
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,120
It made me feel like they were
gonna have to hook me up to an I.V.

876
00:33:28,135 --> 00:33:30,611
Yeah, I was almost out of my mind,
I was so scared.

877
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:32,093
At one point,
I got so panicked,

878
00:33:32,105 --> 00:33:33,843
I was thinking maybe I'd
give her my appendix,

879
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,713
if they could do some kind of
a transplant or something.

880
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:39,181
But I was a little
out of my mind.

881
00:33:39,196 --> 00:33:42,041
- Well, I'm glad she's gonna be okay.
- Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

882
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:43,523
Mr. And Mrs. Nardini?

883
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:45,953
Oh, no. Hi, I'm Luke Danes.
I'm April's dad.

884
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:48,041
Well, she's a little
out of it right now,

885
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:49,702
but you and your wife
can go in and see her.

886
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,332
- No, she's not my...
- No, I'm not, uh...

887
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:56,373
Oh. Sorry. I just assumed.

888
00:33:58,347 --> 00:34:01,261
So, would both of you
like to go in and...

889
00:34:01,276 --> 00:34:02,492
- I'll just...
- You go.

890
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,391
- Okay.
- Okay.

891
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:05,312
Bye.

892
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:14,220
Trust me. Don't call him today.

893
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:16,431
He's going to put
his money down.

894
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:18,090
He just doesn't like
the aggressive stuff.

895
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:21,500
We have to sit back,
relax, let him come to us.

896
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:23,952
If we don't hear from him in a week,
then we panic.

897
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:27,811
Yeah. Nick,
I got to call you back.

898
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:29,252
All right. Bye.

899
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,973
Sorry.

900
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,720
I hope it's okay that I'm here.

901
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:34,342
Hey, it's your apartment.

902
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:38,220
Rory... I'm so
sorry I said that.

903
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:39,683
Yeah, well...

904
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:42,092
I was way out of line.
I just...

905
00:34:42,107 --> 00:34:45,523
I love it that you're here. You know
that I love it that you're here.

906
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:47,753
Yeah. No, I know.

907
00:34:47,768 --> 00:34:49,570
I was just upset.

908
00:34:49,615 --> 00:34:53,453
Well, you had every right to be.
That article was awful.

909
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,372
- It wasn't awful.
- It was awful.

910
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,030
And mean and judgmental,
as you said.

911
00:34:58,157 --> 00:35:00,512
I just--
I don't even know why I didn't see that

912
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:02,972
or what I was thinking,
except that maybe I wasn't thinking.

913
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:05,272
- Look, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

914
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:07,300
I was just trying to
write a clever article,

915
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:08,922
and I didn't mean to upset you,

916
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:11,382
but I should have thought about it.
I should have known.

917
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:12,870
But if that's the
way you feel...

918
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:15,063
But that's just it.
It's not the way I feel.

919
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:17,260
You don't have to approve
of everything I do.

920
00:35:17,278 --> 00:35:18,983
I know that, but I actually do.

921
00:35:18,998 --> 00:35:22,190
I mean, I have total respect for
everything that you're doing.

922
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,641
I'm so proud of you.

923
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:24,751
I know you are.

924
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:26,742
Do you?
Because I really need you to know that.

925
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:27,700
I really know that.

926
00:35:27,718 --> 00:35:30,073
- Because I really am.
- I know.

927
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:31,602
- Promise?
- I promise.

928
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:34,741
And look, the truth is, I wouldn't be so
upset if you weren't such a good writer.

929
00:35:34,777 --> 00:35:37,761
I mean, talk about the pen being
mightier than the sword. It's true.

930
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:39,390
That pen of yours
is a howitzer.

931
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:40,673
You don't have to say that.

932
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:42,442
I wouldn't if it wasn't true.

933
00:35:42,455 --> 00:35:44,430
Can we talk about something
besides the article?

934
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:46,940
You got to compliment me.
Let me compliment you.

935
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:49,540
- We're complimenting each other now?
- If you'll let me.

936
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:51,671
I guess that's okay.

937
00:35:52,355 --> 00:35:54,331
You're a really
great writer, Ace.

938
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:55,812
You have great hair.

939
00:35:55,825 --> 00:35:58,431
You've got awesome teeth.
I've always admired your teeth.

940
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,530
Really? I never knew.

941
00:35:59,547 --> 00:36:01,473
Yep, particularly
the bottom ones.

942
00:36:01,488 --> 00:36:02,762
I love you so much.

943
00:36:02,775 --> 00:36:04,251
I love you, too.

944
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:11,321
Um, but here's the thing.
I have to move out of this apartment.

945
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:14,011
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

946
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:16,453
I always thought that you
would come back and live here.

947
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:19,811
But now that you're getting your own
place nearby, it's just different.

948
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:21,792
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

949
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:24,713
It's just something
I have to do for me.

950
00:36:24,865 --> 00:36:28,293
But you should know that I
plan on taking Henry with me.

951
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:34,942
You'll have to take that up with him.
You did insult him earlier.

952
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:36,813
Did I? Hmm.

953
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,863
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm sorry.

954
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:43,601
I would have buzzed up,
but I saw a delivery guy coming in,

955
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:45,583
so I slipped in with him.

956
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:48,271
Boy, they sure do
eat well over in 4-F.

957
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:50,230
- Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Come on in.

958
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:54,562
What are you doing here?

959
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:57,802
Well, I just--
I wanted to see you.

960
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,932
Look, I got to run out and
take care of a few things.

961
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:03,072
- Good to see you, Lorelai.
- Thanks. Good to see you.

962
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:11,232
I'm guessing your
cellphone's not broken, huh?

963
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:12,953
I just didn't feel
much like talking.

964
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,972
I know.
Look, I know you're upset.

965
00:37:14,987 --> 00:37:17,792
I know this seems sudden and
like we didn't think it through.

966
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:19,712
And in a way, it was impulsive.

967
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:23,142
But in other ways,
it's been 20 years in the making.

968
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,340
That's not why I'm upset.
I'm glad you're married.

969
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:30,383
- You're glad?
- Yes, I'm -- I'm happy for you.

970
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:31,911
It's wonderful.

971
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:33,323
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

972
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:34,952
You're great together.
You love each other.

973
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:37,673
I mean, it's every kid's dream, right?
Parents get back together.

974
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:39,540
But I wasn't there.

975
00:37:40,096 --> 00:37:41,743
You weren't there.

976
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:43,960
I should have been there
when you got married.

977
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:45,732
Yes, you should
have been there.

978
00:37:45,747 --> 00:37:47,852
I mean, how would you feel if I
got married and you weren't there?

979
00:37:47,886 --> 00:37:50,240
- Awful. I would feel awful.
- I feel awful.

980
00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:52,371
Look, I'm sorry. You know, I --

981
00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:53,963
Of course I wanted
you to be there.

982
00:37:53,977 --> 00:37:56,353
I could have been there. All you
had to do was make one phone call.

983
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:58,240
You could have picked up the
phone and said, "come to Paris,"

984
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:00,840
- and I would have come to Paris.
- I know that and I did.

985
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:02,783
I wanted to call you.

986
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:06,041
But then I thought,
if I called you,

987
00:38:06,057 --> 00:38:09,521
then you'd want to talk about it,
and I'd have to explain.

988
00:38:09,536 --> 00:38:13,113
And then maybe I would
talk myself out of it.

989
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,631
I mean, after everything that
happened with the engagement,

990
00:38:15,648 --> 00:38:18,143
I didn't want a debate.
I didn't want to explain.

991
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:21,180
I just wanted to do it,
because I am so certain, Rory.

992
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:24,332
I'm so certain that
this is right.

993
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,462
I really wanted to be
married to your dad,

994
00:38:26,477 --> 00:38:30,710
and I didn't want to talk my way
out of it. I just wanted to do it.

995
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:32,281
I wouldn't have
tried to stop you.

996
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:34,012
I wouldn't have tried
to talk you out of it.

997
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,562
- No?
- No.

998
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:37,383
I mean,
the only thing I might have said

999
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,283
is maybe you guys would want to come
back to the States to get married

1000
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:42,980
so you could have some close friends
there, like Sookie and Jackson,

1001
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:45,021
maybe grandma and grandpa, G.G.

1002
00:38:45,038 --> 00:38:48,032
Or maybe you would have wanted
to live together for a while,

1003
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:50,702
like six months,
just to try it out.

1004
00:38:50,818 --> 00:38:53,171
Yeah, I totally would have
talked you out of it.

1005
00:38:53,655 --> 00:38:55,370
Oh, I'm sorry.

1006
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:59,023
No, don't be sorry. I mean,
I'm really happy for you and dad.

1007
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,623
It's amazing.

1008
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:02,572
It is amazing.

1009
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,140
You're married.

1010
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,411
I know.

1011
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:07,413
- It's big.
- It's big.

1012
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:09,013
It's a big change.

1013
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:11,371
But nothing's gonna change
between you and me.

1014
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:13,003
I don't want you to feel weird.

1015
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:14,192
Okay.

1016
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:18,093
Of course, your dad is gonna put
flat-screen TVs in every room in
the house,

1017
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,933
but your house is
still your house.

1018
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:21,712
Your room is still your room,

1019
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,640
though we did talk about putting
a trundle bed in for G.G.,

1020
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:27,192
so it'd kind of be your room and
G.G.'s room. We don't have to do that.

1021
00:39:27,227 --> 00:39:29,383
- No, I'm down with a trundle bed.
- You are?

1022
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:31,071
Yeah, I love a good trundle.

1023
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:32,740
I'll trundle it up with G.G.

1024
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:34,763
Hey, you didn't take dad's name,
did you?

1025
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:36,750
No. No. "Hayden"? No.

1026
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:40,313
I don't want to be Mrs. Hayden
planetarium for the rest of my life.

1027
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:42,441
I'm Lorelai Gilmore, okay?

1028
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:46,110
Lorelai Gilmore without
the "Gilmore" is like...

1029
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:48,910
Gil, you know, less.

1030
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,631
Okay.

1031
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:07,943
- What ya doin'?
- Hey. I'm sorry.

1032
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:10,053
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you up.

1033
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:13,171
You probably shouldn't be moving
furniture around at midnight, then.

1034
00:40:13,188 --> 00:40:14,723
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1035
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:16,650
- When did you get back?
- Half an hour ago.

1036
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:17,660
How's April?

1037
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:19,590
She's appendix-less,
but she's gonna be okay.

1038
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:20,300
Good.

1039
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,700
I saw Luke.

1040
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:24,180
- Was it okay?
- It was fine.

1041
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,543
Good. It's good you went over.

1042
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:27,782
But then I went to see Rory.

1043
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:28,571
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1044
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:30,330
- How is she?
- She's good.

1045
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:32,123
- We talked, and she's good.
- Good.

1046
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:33,682
And she's really happy
that we're married.

1047
00:40:33,715 --> 00:40:35,180
I knew she would be.

1048
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:42,491
Hey, I was thinking
about the room.

1049
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:46,113
And I was thinking we should paint it,
and we should let G.G. pick the color.

1050
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,921
- She's gonna pick pink.
- Pink would be great in here.

1051
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:50,020
Come on,
help me moves this out.

1052
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:51,200
Okay.

1053
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:57,031
Hey, so I was upstairs.
I got an idea.

1054
00:40:57,198 --> 00:41:00,040
How about a flat-screen
in the bedroom?

1055
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:00,983
The bedroom?

1056
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:02,043
- Come on.
- No!

1057
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:03,392
Think about it!

1058
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:09,533
Let's take a look at the
national weather map and see

1059
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,310
what's in store for the
country over the next f--

1060
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:14,510
The biggest males
weigh over half a ton.

1061
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:18,122
And they're tall enough,
at 10 feet, to see forever.

1062
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:22,833
The russian brown bear is
identical to our grizzly --

1063
00:41:22,845 --> 00:41:25,313
ursus arctos horribilis,

1064
00:41:25,328 --> 00:41:27,513
"the horrible bear."

1065
00:41:27,606 --> 00:41:30,670
Are your closets and drawers so
cluttered you can't find a thing?

1066
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:33,120
The killings were the
latest in a series --

1067
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:36,551
"Tow years ago, I did you out of a wedding 
in this house by eloping to Maryland."

1068
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:39,960
Two years ago,
you were invited to a wedding--

1069
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:41,553
Just a loan.

1070
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,213
- Put this in your vest pocket.
- Don't have a vest.

1071
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:44,910
Then hold it in your hand.

1072
00:41:45,686 --> 00:41:48,453
- "Which was very bad manners."
- Which was very bad manners.

1073
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:51,273
"But I hope to make it up to you by going
 through with it now as originally planned."

1074
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:53,313
But I hope to make
it up to you by --

1075
00:41:54,868 --> 00:41:58,462
By going beautifully
through with it now...
