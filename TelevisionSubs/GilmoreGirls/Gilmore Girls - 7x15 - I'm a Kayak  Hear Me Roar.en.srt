1
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:05,828
Yes?

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,646
Um, Paris, it's Lorelai.

3
00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:11,208
Come in. The door is open.

4
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,717
I'm so sorry that it's so early.
I --

5
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,028
Oh. Wow. Hey.

6
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,651
Sorry. We're in the middle
of our yoga practice.

7
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:22,756
I didn't really imagine you
guys to be the yoga types.

8
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:24,793
It was a circuitous
path that led us here.

9
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:27,010
I only signed up for the class
'cause I thought it'd help me

10
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:29,280
B.S. my way through any
med-school interviews

11
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:32,530
when they talk about all
that homeopathic, holistic,

12
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,957
naturopathic,
chiropractic, TCM,

13
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:36,596
unani, ayurveda crap.

14
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:39,620
Plus, we thought it would be
funny to goof on. But now...

15
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:41,812
I guess the great
cosmic goof is on us.

16
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:43,432
Is Rory asleep?

17
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:45,343
You mean spiritually
or literally?

18
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,122
Literally.

19
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,471
Yeah, I think so.

20
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:52,493
Hey, mom.

21
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:55,490
Hey. Sorry I didn't call first.
I left my phone at home.

22
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:57,052
And it's 6:00 in the morning.
Why are you up?

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,221
Paris and Doyle were chanting.
Why are you up?

24
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,220
Oh, I've been up for a while,
driving --

25
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:02,611
- Driving?
- Yeah, for a few hours.

26
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:03,671
- Driving?
- Yeah, driving.

27
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:05,553
- Mom, what's going on?
- Want to go for a drive?

28
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,693
Um, sure. Let's go for a drive.

29
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,731
So... we're driving.

30
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:13,993
Yeah, we're driving.

31
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:22,943
Honey, your dad and I
split up last night.

32
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:26,781
Oh, mom, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

33
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:28,910
I'm okay --
I'm driving, moving forward.

34
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:30,493
- You are driving.
- Yep.

35
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:33,750
It just wasn't right, you know?
And he knew it wasn't right,

36
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:35,830
and I knew it wasn't right.
It just wasn't...

37
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:38,123
- It wasn't right.
- It wasn't,

38
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:40,283
and pretending it was was just
gonna hurt him and hurt me,

39
00:01:40,318 --> 00:01:42,992
and we didn't want to do that,
so we split up,

40
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:46,161
and he's moving out, and...
what are you thinking?

41
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:49,433
I don't know.
I guess, first of all, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:52,503
I'm so sorry.
And... secondly...

43
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:56,001
I guess I'm thinking that
I'm not totally surprised.

44
00:01:56,037 --> 00:02:01,103
I mean, at first, I was so excited
that you guys were getting together

45
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:03,253
because it seemed like
something that was meant to be,

46
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:05,553
something that
was like destiny.

47
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:08,333
But... then... I guess...

48
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:10,953
to me,
it kind of never felt right.

49
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:12,361
I'm so sorry.

50
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:16,033
I just want you to know, your dad is
gonna be in your life -- in our lives.

51
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,100
I know that.

52
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,781
And G.G., too. I mean,

53
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:21,193
your dad is still your dad,
you know?

54
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:23,071
I know that, mom. I do.

55
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:26,620
So, who else knows?

56
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:28,552
Nobody. That's it.

57
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,873
Well, you and the
Quickie Mart guy.

58
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:32,263
You told the Quickie Mart guy?

59
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:34,132
I was upset.
I was standing by the magazines.

60
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:37,270
I didn't want him to think I was
verklempt over Nicole Richie so...

61
00:02:37,977 --> 00:02:40,402
that's it.
I wish I could leave it at that.

62
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:43,652
The idea of telling your
grandmother -- God.

63
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:47,962
- Oh. Oh, wow.
- What?

64
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:50,911
We're out of gas?

65
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:52,670
We're out of... gas.

66
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,221
- I've never run out of gas before.
- Me neither.

67
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:03,640
Well, here we are.

68
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:05,400
Out of gas.

69
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:07,530
Well, I guess I should ca--

70
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,222
I don't have my cellphone.

71
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:12,560
I left mine in my room.

72
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,633
Okay. It's okay. No, it's fine.

73
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,303
We'll just have to get gas somehow.
We can do this.

74
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:24,003
There's a gas station up ahead,
where route 68 goes through Naugatuck.

75
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:25,110
Okay.

76
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:27,683
So... we're walking?

77
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:29,072
Oh, we're walking.

78
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,873
Well, it's a beautiful day.

79
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:40,253
Yes, it is.

80
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:42,320
It's weird that it
can be so beautiful.

81
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,490
Yeah.

82
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,112
How far is Naugatuck from here?

83
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,802
I don't know exactly.

84
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:50,200
I guess it's walking distance.

85
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,942
I hope it's walking distance.

86
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,370
Hello?

87
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,141
- Hi, there.
- How you doing?

88
00:04:55,177 --> 00:04:57,093
- How are you?
- May I take your coats?

89
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:59,291
- Coats?
- Oh. Okay.

90
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:00,710
Thank you.

91
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:04,632
Um-- I-- th--
I think she's in the living room.

92
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,333
I'm not sure--
maybe-- not sure--

93
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:09,550
What? Her mouth is moving.

94
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:11,263
I can't hear anything.
Is something wrong with my ears?

95
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:12,971
No, I don't think it's your ears,
poor thing.

96
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,892
This house is a giant skinner box
with chippendale chairs. Hello?

97
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,101
In here!

98
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:19,601
- Hey, mom.
- Hey, grandma.

99
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:21,782
Hello, Rory, Lorelai.
How are you?

100
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:25,102
Good. How are you? How's dad?
Is he up to this, you think?

101
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:25,941
Why wouldn't he be?

102
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:29,930
Well, mom, he just got out of the
hospital. I wonder if it's too soon.

103
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,801
The doctor said there's no reason he
can't go back to his normal routine,

104
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:34,943
as long as he doesn't do
anything too strenuous.

105
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:37,931
It's not as though sitting at a table,
having dinner with one's family

106
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:39,512
requires a great
deal of effort.

107
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,513
Well... you're right.

108
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,011
He should be down by now.

109
00:05:44,657 --> 00:05:45,991
Is Christopher coming?

110
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:49,103
Um... he's not able to make it tonight.
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:50,111
Well...

112
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:51,662
that's too bad.

113
00:05:52,698 --> 00:05:54,950
In the meantime,
can I offer you a drink?

114
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:57,812
Yes. The usual --
Martini up, with a twist.

115
00:05:57,846 --> 00:06:00,572
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not serving alcohol tonight.

116
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:02,750
I told you there was something
wrong with my ears. What?

117
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,003
I'm serving nonalcoholic
cocktails only.

118
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:06,950
There's no such thing as
a nonalcoholic cocktail.

119
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:09,170
There most certainly is.
It's called a mocktail.

120
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:11,130
- You're serving mocktails?
- Yes.

121
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,722
I can offer you a Shirley
Temple or a Roy Rogers.

122
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:14,931
I'll have a Roy Rogers.

123
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:17,460
Why not a howdy doody
or a captain Kangaroo?

124
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:20,532
Lorelai, stop being so selfish.
We're doing this for your father.

125
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:24,243
After you've had open-heart surgery,
alcohol is strictly verboten.

126
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:26,222
No alcohol. No alcohol.

127
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:29,262
Well, there you are.
I told you to tell Mr. Gilmore

128
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:30,820
that his daughter
and granddaughter

129
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,392
were pulling into the
driveway 15 minutes ago.

130
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,681
Mr. Gilmore says he's in
the middle of watching golf

131
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:37,471
and he'll be down as
soon as he's finished.

132
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,611
Golf? He's watching golf?

133
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,962
Well, if you tell him we're
expecting him downstairs,

134
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:43,270
I would very much
appreciate it.

135
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:46,490
I'm not really sure that falls
under my job description.

136
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:49,821
Fine. Fine.

137
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:51,351
Fine.

138
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,231
Fine.

139
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,791
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

140
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:01,071
Oh, that's a strong one, mom.
You know I'm driving.

141
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:02,111
Tastes great.

142
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:03,542
You know what se
tastes great? Rum.

143
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,070
For heaven's sake, Lorelai.

144
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:07,390
If you're unable to go for
a few hours without alcohol,

145
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:09,827
I can send the maid out
to get you a six-pack.

146
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,786
- Richard!
- All right. I'm here.

147
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:14,390
You can put away your leash.

148
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:15,963
- Hey, grandpa.
- Hey, dad.

149
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:18,601
- Rory, Lorelai.
- How are you feeling?

150
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,281
Like a man who's been torn away

151
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,650
from one of the most pivotal
golf matches in history.

152
00:07:22,688 --> 00:07:24,450
If you're not up for it,
we can take a rain check.

153
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,780
We don't need a rain check.

154
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,832
Richard, wouldn't you like
to change for dinner?

155
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:29,522
No, if you're going to
treat me like a patient,

156
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:32,103
I'm going to act like a patient.
Patients wear robes.

157
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:35,431
All right. Fine.
May I offer you a mocktail?

158
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:37,022
No. I don't want a mocktail.

159
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,770
In fact, I'd like to skip
"mocktail hour" altogether

160
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,191
and go straight to dinner.

161
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,031
But it isn't time yet to --

162
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:46,311
All right. We'll eat now.

163
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:48,911
Francette, would you please
go tell Aurora to tell Stefan

164
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,840
we are ready to have
dinner served now?

165
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,083
Look, Mrs.
Gilmore, I have to reiterate,

166
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:55,121
I am here as a
medical professional,

167
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:56,461
not a carrier pigeon.

168
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:59,560
Well, as a medical professional,
you should be concerned with my health.

169
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,270
And not eating isn't healthy,
is it?

170
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:04,103
Nor is getting agitated.

171
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,613
And I have to tell you, Francette,
I'm getting quite agitated.

172
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:08,081
Don't threaten me, Mr. Gilmore.

173
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:10,521
It's fine, it's fine.
I'll go tell her myself.

174
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:13,641
Wow.

175
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:16,041
A six-pack sounds
really good right now.

176
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:20,801
Here's your plate, sir.

177
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:23,071
I hope it's not too hot --
the plate, not the food.

178
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,021
Oh, well. It's fish again.

179
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:31,200
It's sea bass.

180
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:33,640
And sea bass is a fish --
hence my comment

181
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:36,361
"surprise, surprise --
it's fish again."

182
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:37,401
It tastes good.

183
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,383
Tastes like fish.

184
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,882
I don't think it tastes fishy.

185
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:41,560
Sea bash is not a fishy fish.

186
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:44,790
Mackerel is a fishy fish.
Trout can be a fishy fish.

187
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:47,293
But sea bass is not
really a fishy fish.

188
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,621
I didn't say it tasted fishy.
I said it tasted like fish.

189
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,921
I think it tastes good.

190
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,520
The green beans are very green-beany,
which is so good,

191
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:56,472
especially if you like green beans,
which I do.

192
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,513
Anyone see any good
movies lately?

193
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:01,643
- No.
- This fish is bland.

194
00:09:02,197 --> 00:09:04,231
Would you like some
more lemon-dill sauce?

195
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:05,122
No.

196
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:06,372
Okay.

197
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:07,621
The sauce is good, mom.

198
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:08,880
It's nice, isn't it?

199
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,283
Tart, but not too tart.

200
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:13,480
Stefan, the chef we stole from the
Lowells, is doing a marvelous job

201
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:15,543
incorporating the dietary
recommendations --

202
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:16,711
Enough.

203
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:18,970
If forced, I may eat this fish,

204
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:22,852
but I absolutely refuse to waste my
time having a conversation about it.

205
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:27,480
So, Lorelai, I take it that
Christopher is still out of town?

206
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,080
He couldn't make it tonight.

207
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,191
That's too bad.

208
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:32,373
That man has been traveling
quite a lot lately.

209
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,330
Oh yeah? I guess.

210
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:36,110
I hope he'll be around for the
party your mother's planning.

211
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:37,650
I know I'm looking
forward to it.

212
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:40,631
It's my only hope for eating a
decent meal in the forceable future.

213
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:43,342
Your mother was planning to
serve cornish game hens.

214
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,863
Is that still the plan, Emily?

215
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:47,192
Yes, I've even spoken to
the caterer about preparing

216
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:48,920
a special skinless hen for you.

217
00:09:48,957 --> 00:09:50,890
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

218
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:52,370
Don't get angry, Richard.

219
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:54,352
It's your doctor's orders,
not mine.

220
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:56,071
You know what? I'm full.

221
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:57,940
These flowers are pretty.

222
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,470
They really are nice.

223
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:01,622
If you will excuse me,
I have to get back to my golf.

224
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:02,961
- Richard!
- Please.

225
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:05,181
I know I've missed
Jacklin's bogey on the 16th.

226
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:06,943
I'm not missing his
putt on the 17th.

227
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:08,630
That's a famous putt, Emily.

228
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,461
Wait --
you're watching an old golf game?

229
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:14,603
Well, it's the last singles
match of the '69 Ryder cup.

230
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,730
Jacklin, Nicklaus --
the concession!

231
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:20,213
I can't believe you're watching an
old golf game instead of eating...

232
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:22,053
- Fish?
- Dinner with your family.

233
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,622
You already know how
it's going to turn out.

234
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,982
Well, that never stopped
people going to see "Hamlet."

235
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:28,873
Lorelai, Rory,
good night. Emily.

236
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:33,112
Richard... Richard!

237
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:37,471
The idea that two grown men hitting
a tiny ball with metal sticks

238
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:40,223
is the equivalent of
"Hamlet" -- ridiculous.

239
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:43,073
But can I say anything? No!
Because I can't agitate him.

240
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:45,602
It is ridiculous.
Golf is really more like "Richard III."

241
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:46,723
They're all hunched over.

242
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:48,050
I'm going to go get him.

243
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:56,182
It sounds like grandma's going full steam
ahead with this whole party-planning thing.

244
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:56,890
I know!

245
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:59,401
She's going to kill 400
cornish game hens --

246
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:01,000
probably with her
own bare hands.

247
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:02,472
Your grandfather just
had a heart attack.

248
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:03,822
Your grandmother
is not drinking.

249
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:07,751
This isn't exactly the ideal time to tell
them their only daughter's marriage is over.

250
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:08,690
I know.

251
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:10,420
I don't know what she'll do.
She's gone bananas.

252
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:13,030
For all I know,
she'll throw a molotov mocktail at me.

253
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:16,343
I know, but only you can
save the cornish game hens.

254
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:18,572
Save the cornish game hens!

255
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:32,683
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
Get back in bed.

256
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:34,312
I just want to check
my e-mail real quick.

257
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,491
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What's the big deal?

258
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:39,792
I made you a special
birthday breakfast in bed,

259
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:42,310
and if you don't go back to bed, it's
gonna be a special birthday breakfast

260
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,232
at a desk, which is something
I have never heard of.

261
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:45,271
Happy birthday.

262
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,311
Now it is, now that there are
cinnamon buns in the picture.

263
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:50,301
Are you impressed?
It's my specialty.

264
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:51,830
I can cook anything
that comes in a tube.

265
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:53,592
I am impressed and hungry.

266
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:56,662
Get back in bed!
You are the birthday boy.

267
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,941
You should not be working.
You should be luxuriating,

268
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:01,340
eating peeled grapes and
being fanned with palm fronds.

269
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:04,241
Peeled grapes? Well, what if the
birthday boy gets back in bed

270
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:05,671
but is allowed to
bring his laptop?

271
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:06,543
Deal.

272
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:08,852
Somebody's pretty into
this whole birthday thing.

273
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:13,241
If by "birthday thing," you mean the
celebration of the miracle of your birth,

274
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,730
the anniversary of the day when
this world went from being

275
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:18,991
a world without Logan Hunzberger
to a world with Logan Hunzberger,

276
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:21,011
then, yes, I'm pretty into it.

277
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:22,981
You really love me, don't you?

278
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:23,953
You're okay.

279
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:26,582
I'm not used to all this hoopla.
Birthdays aren't a very big deal

280
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:28,351
- in the Hunzberger family.
- Why not?

281
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:30,171
Because birthdays aren't
something you achieve.

282
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:32,851
Why should you be lauded for
something that just happens to you?

283
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,151
Didn't you have birthday
parties when you were a kid?

284
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:36,760
They were parties, sort of,

285
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,853
but not with any kids
I actually knew.

286
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,060
That sounds like a blast.

287
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:41,461
I never had a regular
birthday cake.

288
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:44,353
I always wanted just a good old,
plain yellow cake, with frosting.

289
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:47,263
But desserts were some fancy
flamb� thing with alcohol.

290
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:50,740
Well, those years of birthday
neglect will become a faint memory

291
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,212
after the Gilmore treatment.

292
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:54,453
Plenty of hoopla in a
Gilmore birthday, huh?

293
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,333
Hoopla and then some.
My mom always went all out.

294
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:59,211
- How's your mom doing?
- She's okay.

295
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:00,353
And you?

296
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:02,890
I feel like celebrating
your birthday.

297
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,661
Why are you working?
It's your birthday.

298
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:08,142
And I thought your deal
was already closed.

299
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:09,133
It is.

300
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,802
Then all that's left
to do is celebrate --

301
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:14,862
and tell your dad, because you said
Hunzbergers celebrate achievement.

302
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:17,141
Isn't closing this deal
a pretty big achievement?

303
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:18,863
I don't want to tell my dad --
not yet.

304
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,602
He can read about it in
the Wall Street journal,

305
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:23,380
which in fact is what I just had
sent to me -- the press release.

306
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,533
The press release, huh?
That's fancy.

307
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:28,481
"Hunzberger, a young
visionary entrepreneur."

308
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:29,852
Does that sound dorky?

309
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:31,973
Nope. Sounds great.
It's exciting.

310
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,641
- These are good, by the way.
- Good.

311
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:36,622
But what would be great with them
is a nice bowl of peeled grapes.

312
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,110
- Oh yeah?
- Would you make peeled grapes?

313
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:39,790
If they come in a tube, I do.

314
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:44,140
Hello?

315
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:45,260
- Lorelai?
- Mom?

316
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:47,110
- They won't deliver.
- Deliver what?

317
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,310
And, apparently, none of their
help has driver's licenses.

318
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:51,391
That's a little irresponsible,
don't you think?

319
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:53,411
You got to help me out
a little here, mom.

320
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:55,373
Why are you leering at me?

321
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,162
Mother, are you on peyote?

322
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:59,453
Mr. Gilmore's light
bulb is bothering him.

323
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,441
I'm sorry --
it's that some sort of nurse code?

324
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:03,822
The 60-watt bulb on
his bedside lamp

325
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:06,910
is apparently casting a harsh
glare on the television.

326
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,572
Well, then,
get him another light bulb.

327
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:09,963
It's just not my job.

328
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:12,540
- Then get Francette to do it.
- I am Francette.

329
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:14,340
- Mom.
- Aurora is the maid.

330
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:17,080
Then ask Aurora to
find a light bulb.

331
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:19,263
- I can't find Aurora.
- You can't find Aurora?

332
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:21,140
She's hiding from Mr. Gilmore.

333
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:23,211
- Hello?
- She's hiding from --

334
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:26,263
Never mind. I'll get it myself.
Honestly -- these people!

335
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,630
Mother, what is
going on over there?

336
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,002
Your father is running
low on his blood thinners,

337
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,141
and the pharmacy can't
be bothered to deliver.

338
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:35,290
Are you calling to ask me if I
will pick up dad's prescription?

339
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:37,923
Well, I can't leave the house,
or chaos will ensue.

340
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:39,941
You're calling to imply that
you would like to ask me

341
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,161
to pick up dad's prescription ?

342
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:44,972
It's a pharmacy at the corner
of Walden and Hasbrook lane.

343
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:46,482
Okay--

344
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:47,812
Hello?

345
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,981
No, it's no problem at all.
I'd be happy to.

346
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,420
It's just nice to
be appreciated.

347
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:54,590
By the way,
Chris and I broke up. Bye.

348
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,680
Yeah, it's true --
he's definitely moved out.

349
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:04,030
Last time I saw the...
beagle's car in the driveway,

350
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,042
it was days ago.

351
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:06,421
Then I saw the mover's truck,

352
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:09,401
so only the...
hen is living there now.

353
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:12,191
Did the hen break up with the beagle,
or the beagle with the hen?

354
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:13,350
I don't know.

355
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:14,600
The poor hen.

356
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:16,383
She's been through so much.

357
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:19,343
You know, just kind of getting
used to him -- the beagle.

358
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,611
But he's not right for her.
He's a beagle, you know.

359
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:24,103
And beagles belong
with beagles.

360
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:26,502
And the hen belongs
with the rooster.

361
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:27,391
Maybe.

362
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,150
Well, does the rooster know
about the hen and the beagle?

363
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:33,440
Oh, yeah, east side Tillie was in here
yesterday, blabbing her big mouth off.

364
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,092
How did he take it?
Did you see his face?

365
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:37,823
Yeah, but you know the rooster.

366
00:15:37,856 --> 00:15:40,550
It's like looking at stonehenge.
I don't know what he thinks.

367
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:43,950
I hope he gets his act together
because I think they're perfect.

368
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:48,110
Yeah, but maybe sh--
the hen belongs with someone else...

369
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,561
like a penguin or an ostrich.

370
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,911
I can no longer sit here
and listen to this.

371
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:54,513
Oh, good. Go sit over there.

372
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:58,890
I'm sorry, but I can't in good conscience
let this perverse conversation continue.

373
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,081
Are you insinuating that a hen
could mate with an ostrich?

374
00:16:02,117 --> 00:16:05,361
Because even ignoring the question
of biological feasibility,

375
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,631
it's completely
morally reprehensible.

376
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,053
Oh, buzz off with your
"morally reprehensible."

377
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:11,860
How do you expect her
to lay those eggs?

378
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:13,592
Have you thought about that,
have you?

379
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:16,992
- Hey, big brother!
- Surprise!

380
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:20,850
Yes, Liz, T.J., jeez,
and piles of your belongings.

381
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:22,471
It's so good to see you.

382
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:24,273
Yeah, you, too. Hey, Doula.

383
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:25,773
- She looks good, huh?
- Yeah.

384
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:28,682
Sturdy, too,
like she might be a female wrestler.

385
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:30,130
- Oh, fingers crossed.
- Right.

386
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,230
You know what I'm thinking?
Free tickets.

387
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:34,762
So you two just decided
to swing by the diner

388
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:38,592
with a half a dozen bags and
a baby apparatus of some kind?

389
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:41,361
No, we decided to come
and keep you company.

390
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:42,362
- Company?
- Yeah.

391
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:44,491
Now that April's in New Mexico,
we figured

392
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:46,450
you might be getting
a little lonely.

393
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:47,960
No, I'm not getting lonely.

394
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:50,542
I miss having
April around, sure,

395
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,882
but I talk to her every
wednesday after swim practice

396
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,022
and every sunday if she's
done all her homework.

397
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,462
It's going good.

398
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:58,702
Are you buying this?
I'm not buying it.

399
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:00,312
Buying what?
There's nothing to buy.

400
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:01,910
Hey, where are you going?

401
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:04,301
Oh, don't do the
stiff-upper-lip thing with us.

402
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,310
We're family.
We're here for you.

403
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:10,180
Look, Liz, it's really sweet of
you to come by and visit, but --

404
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:13,432
You're planning on
staying here for a while?

405
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:14,702
We don't want you to be lonely.

406
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:17,422
How long exactly are you
planning on keeping me company?

407
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:19,212
A few days, a week tops.

408
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,963
I don't need to
be kept company.

409
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:23,291
Yeah, but you --

410
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:25,472
We should just come clean.

411
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:26,920
- No.
- Yes. About what?

412
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:28,153
- About nothing.
- T.J.

413
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,893
How about them celtics, huh?
They sure can dribble a basketball.

414
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,271
- Liz...
- We got moths.

415
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:34,332
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, me too, believe me.

416
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,612
Luke, it's horrible. I hate those
little floppy, fluttery jerks.

417
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:38,823
Moths, huh?

418
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:42,102
Dude, they're everywhere -- flying around,
popping out of the flour container,

419
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:45,700
congregating around the light bulbs,
all pasty and white.

420
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:48,161
I swear,
moths are like the loser butterflies

421
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:50,860
that couldn't get laid if they
tied a $100 bill to their --

422
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,502
T.J., I got it. You got moths.

423
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:55,000
So we figured we
could avoid the moths

424
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:57,770
and have a little
quality time with you.

425
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:02,700
Yeah, all right, just go ahead upstairs,
make yourselves at home.

426
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:03,750
Love it!

427
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:16,171
It's miso, Richard.
It's good for you.

428
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,261
Soup.

429
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:20,021
Stefan! Stefan!

430
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,890
Soup is not a meal,
nor is a salad.

431
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:26,322
Soup and salad are either
precursors to a meal or addenda.

432
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,732
Richard, please.

433
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:29,832
Soup and salad is not a meal.

434
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:31,783
We have salmon if
you want salmon.

435
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:34,470
I don't want salmon.
For heaven's sakes, I don't want salmon.

436
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:37,202
What I would like
is a proper meal.

437
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:39,500
Aurora, the door!

438
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:42,202
I was given certain
dietary parameters.

439
00:18:42,236 --> 00:18:43,780
I know that. I'm not stupid.

440
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:45,782
I know what the
situation is here.

441
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:48,432
- I just don't know --
- Francette, Aurora,

442
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:51,440
either of you, both of you,
will someone answer the door?!

443
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:54,002
I'm sure Stefan is interested
in your input, Richard.

444
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,580
Here's my input --
this food is inedible.

445
00:18:57,186 --> 00:19:00,502
Fine, I'll get it myself,
not that it's my job.

446
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:04,782
A suggestion -- maybe you would
prefer some light sandwiches.

447
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:06,011
Sandwiches?!

448
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,900
Hi. I come bearing drugs.

449
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:08,930
Please don't bellow that.

450
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,161
Bellow what -- "drugs"?!

451
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:11,850
- Lorelai.
- How's dad doing?

452
00:19:11,886 --> 00:19:12,931
He's just fine.

453
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:15,710
I swear you can get better
food in an airplane.

454
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:17,230
I haven't been in a submarine,

455
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:19,473
but I'll wager the food
is better there, too.

456
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,991
It's an adjustment.

457
00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:23,682
Let me offer one
more suggestion.

458
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:24,873
What -- tacos?

459
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:26,232
No. I quit!

460
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,252
- Fine.
- Stefan, no!

461
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll tell you something.

462
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:32,561
I have worked in so many
four-star restaurants,

463
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:34,563
I could have my
own constellation.

464
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:36,680
And yet,
I'm treated like this?!

465
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:39,642
I'm sorry,
but I have too much self-respect

466
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,770
to work for this... terror!

467
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:47,962
How are things
going around here?

468
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:49,112
- Fine.
- Fine.

469
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,341
Feeling okay, dad?

470
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:51,442
I'm fine.

471
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:52,823
Now, if you'll excuse me,

472
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:56,060
I think I'm going to go watch
Bob Tway vanquish Greg Norman

473
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,993
in the '86 PGA championship.

474
00:19:58,028 --> 00:20:00,822
Before you go, did you managed
to call Rob Mandel's office?

475
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:01,591
No.

476
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,723
But Angelique called
three times this morning.

477
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:06,242
Bully for her. I'm sorry.
I have golf to watch.

478
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:08,202
But, Richard,
you didn't eat a thing.

479
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:09,901
He didn't eat a thing.

480
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,213
Mom, send something up to him.

481
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:13,440
Send what? You saw yourself --
Stefan just quit.

482
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:14,752
You could make him something.

483
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,311
I mean, the maid could --
what is her name?

484
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:20,252
Oh, I don't know.
Aurora, I think. I don't know.

485
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,321
Anyway, she's
hiding, apparently.

486
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,822
Aurora?

487
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:26,930
Aurora? Where are you?

488
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,281
The maid is hiding?

489
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:30,430
According to the nurse,
but she's useless

490
00:20:30,468 --> 00:20:32,921
because she won't do anything that
doesn't involve a stethoscope.

491
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:34,783
- I can make something for dad.
- Oh, please.

492
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:36,942
I can make toast,
if the conditions are ideal.

493
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:38,953
He won't eat it, anyway.
He'll just snap at me,

494
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,513
snapping at everyone in sight.

495
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:43,561
The poor maid quivers every time he
comes near her. She just quivers.

496
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:44,652
It's terrible.

497
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:46,801
And his accountant's office keeps
calling because he's supposed

498
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:49,962
to be filing an 1120.
Who knows what an 1120 is?

499
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,650
I do. It's a federal tax form.

500
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:53,072
Aurora!

501
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,803
He won't call them back.
All he wants to do is watch golf.

502
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,682
- What's with all the golf?
- I have no idea.

503
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,432
He just lies there in bed,
staring at the TV like a zombie.

504
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,252
Everything is falling apart.
Everything is chaotic.

505
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:07,323
Mom, please, sit down. I'm gonna
make you a delicious mocktail, huh?

506
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:10,212
And then you enjoy
that and relax

507
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:13,612
and I'll take care of the chef and I'll
make sure that dad takes his medicine

508
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,360
so you don't have
to worry. Here.

509
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:19,521
Thank you. But I'm going to call
Angelique and ask about this 1120.

510
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:22,233
I'll find Aurora.

511
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,601
Aurora!

512
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:28,162
To heat most of these up,
you just zap them for a couple minutes.

513
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:31,760
Don't worry. Each meal has a note with
cooking instructions taped to it.

514
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:33,341
Did I already tell
you you're a goddess?

515
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,451
You might have mentioned
something to that effect.

516
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:36,762
Could I be the one
with the multiarms?

517
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:37,512
The who?

518
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:39,293
The goddess with all these arms.
I want to be her.

519
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:40,932
Sure. Hey, these look good.

520
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:42,732
Don't sound so surprised.

521
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:45,261
Yeah, but they're supposed to be
healthy, right? They are all healthy?

522
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:46,951
They're ridiculously healthy.

523
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:48,761
- Hey!
- Hey.

524
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:50,473
What did we do for
my 8th birthday?

525
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:53,571
I don't know. Is this a quiz?
Are you on some sort of radio contest?

526
00:21:53,607 --> 00:21:55,620
For Logan's birthday,
I'm trying to put together

527
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:57,911
a night of all the birthday
highlights that he missed.

528
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,703
And you're looking
for the classics?

529
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:00,731
Exactly.

530
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:04,110
I remember that we had an
outer-space birthday when I turned 6.

531
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:06,763
Right. We made space
suits out of garbage bags.

532
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:08,641
We had tang and
freeze-dried ice cream.

533
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:11,822
And then when I turned 7,
we did a fiesta birthday.

534
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:14,402
Pi�atas and tacos and
freeze-dried ice cream.

535
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:16,070
Freeze-dried ice
cream is the best.

536
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:19,170
I remember enjoying my 8th birthday.
I just don't remember what it was.

537
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,691
- Teddy-bear tea party.
- Oh, that's right.

538
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:23,363
- So, how's it going over there?
- I'd say weirder.

539
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:25,441
Your grandma's a
little on edge.

540
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:29,803
Oh, hey, mom, it's Logan on the
other line. Can you hold on a sec?

541
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:31,080
Tell him "happy
birthday" for me.

542
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,161
Will do.

543
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,690
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

544
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:36,143
And happy birthday from my mom.

545
00:22:36,176 --> 00:22:37,202
Thank you.

546
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:38,781
Hey, so my dad just called.

547
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,702
Oh, he did?

548
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,550
Yeah. Apparently,
he remembered my birthday,

549
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:43,752
and he said he wants to take
us out to dinner, you and me.

550
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:45,600
Oh. That's... great.

551
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:49,570
I know it's last minute, and I know you
got your special Gilmore hoopla planned,

552
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:50,992
so we don't have to go
if you don't want to go.

553
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:53,841
No, we should go.
We can always do the Gilmore hoopla

554
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:55,202
after we have dinner
with your dad.

555
00:22:55,236 --> 00:22:57,060
Are you sure? It'll probably be lame.
For all I know,

556
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:59,040
he's invited us to crash a
meeting with Rupert Murdoch.

557
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,203
That's cool.
I can hang with mad dog Murdoch.

558
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:04,040
Okay. Well, cool, cool.
Thanks, Ace. I'll call him back.

559
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,782
- Happy birthday!
- Bye!

560
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:08,072
Hey, sorry about that.

561
00:23:08,106 --> 00:23:10,993
- How's the birthday boy?
- He's good. He's fine.

562
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:13,452
But I guess his dad called
and wants to take us out

563
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:14,852
to a birthday dinner tonight.

564
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:16,552
That sounds like
a load of laughs.

565
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:19,993
Yeah. Mitchum --
that man is fundamentally incapable

566
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:23,030
of making me feel anything
but small and awful.

567
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,581
That's not true.
He's made you feel incompetent, too.

568
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:28,331
I guess Logan was excited that
his dad wanted to take us out,

569
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,580
so that's sweet.

570
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:33,293
Have you told grandma and
grandpa about you and dad yet?

571
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:34,670
Um, not yet.

572
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:38,591
I feel obligated to remind you that
the lives of 400 cornish game hens

573
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:39,633
hang in the balance.

574
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:40,803
Happy Logan's birthday.

575
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,110
Happy Logan's birthday to you.

576
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:43,190
Bye.

577
00:23:43,225 --> 00:23:45,423
Mmm, that looks unhealthy.

578
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,930
Thank you.

579
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:50,811
Oh, I love this song.

580
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,040
I don't know why we didn't
think of this before.

581
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:53,830
Think of what?

582
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:57,471
Using your fishing line for stringing --
it's really incredible.

583
00:23:57,507 --> 00:23:59,802
Durable yet plenty
thin and flexible.

584
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:00,612
I'm glad.

585
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,363
And some of this doohickeys,
man, are really cute.

586
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,210
Check it out -- sexy, yeah?

587
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:07,621
Oh, wow, babe,
these are gorgeous.

588
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:08,502
Thank you, sweetie.

589
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:10,581
I'm so proud of
your sister, Luke.

590
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,141
This jewelry stuff has really taken off,
you know?

591
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:16,101
And it's great because now I
can be the stay-at-home dad

592
00:24:16,137 --> 00:24:17,622
I've always dreamed of being

593
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:20,193
while this one goes out
and brings home the bacon.

594
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,291
We're gonna drive our
new van from trade show

595
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,963
to trade show,
selling the jewelry.

596
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:26,822
In a couple weeks,
there's this big show in Manhattan.

597
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,052
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

598
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:29,370
At the Javits Center.

599
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:31,482
We'll just load up the van,
head up 91,

600
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:33,662
and start showing off
the family jewels.

601
00:24:33,697 --> 00:24:36,881
That sounds good. I wouldn't
take the 91 through New Haven.

602
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:39,121
There's tons of construction there now.
I'd take the Merritt.

603
00:24:39,155 --> 00:24:40,641
How do you know
there's construction?

604
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:43,791
'Cause I went there to visit Lorelai's
dad when he had the heart attack.

605
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:46,532
- You did?
- I thought I told you that.

606
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,441
No, you told me he
had a heart attack.

607
00:24:48,476 --> 00:24:50,862
You didn't tell me you
went to the hospital.

608
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:52,470
What's the big deal?

609
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:56,620
I don't know.
I mean, you went there for Lorelai,

610
00:24:56,656 --> 00:24:58,470
and what's going on with
her and her husband?

611
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:01,512
I don't know.
They split up or something.

612
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:02,543
They did?

613
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:04,551
Yeah, well, a week or so ago.

614
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:06,582
Well, well, well.

615
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:09,000
- What?
- The plot thickens.

616
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,552
The plot does not
thicken, okay?

617
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:13,460
We're friends -- that's all.

618
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:15,982
I just went out when I heard
her dad was sick. That's it.

619
00:25:16,018 --> 00:25:18,502
- That is a relief.
- T.J.!

620
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:20,832
What? It's a load off my mind.
That's all I'm saying.

621
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:23,183
'Cause I don't think you should
get back together with her.

622
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:25,342
Nobody's talking about getting
back together with her.

623
00:25:25,377 --> 00:25:27,783
Good. 'Cause that woman is drama.
Every time you mention her,

624
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:29,531
it's got something to
do with the hospital.

625
00:25:29,566 --> 00:25:31,480
- What?
- How's her dad doing?

626
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:32,723
Good, I guess.

627
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,330
You haven't called Lorelai?

628
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,200
No.

629
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:38,092
Don't call her.
Don't open that Pandora's box.

630
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:40,993
If he wants to call her,
he should call her -- they're friends.

631
00:25:41,027 --> 00:25:42,673
Just lock it up, Luke.

632
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:43,800
Lock it up.

633
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:46,183
Solder that baby shut.

634
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,143
Would you follow me, please?

635
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:51,230
Mr. Hunzberger is
already at the table.

636
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:52,901
"Mr. Hunzberger is
already at the table."

637
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:54,113
I told you.

638
00:25:54,368 --> 00:25:55,662
There they are.

639
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:56,931
Happy birthday, Logan.

640
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:58,480
- Rory.
- Hi.

641
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,101
- Great to see you.
- You too.

642
00:26:00,137 --> 00:26:01,281
Sit, sit.

643
00:26:01,347 --> 00:26:04,023
I took the liberty of ordering a
bottle of champagne for the table.

644
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:04,993
Oh, nice.

645
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:06,033
Rory, how does that sound?

646
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:07,593
Sounds like music to my ears.

647
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:08,730
Good, good.

648
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,680
So, you look pretty good.

649
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:12,393
You been hitting the
squash courts lately?

650
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:15,151
I wish. I haven't had much of a chance.
I've been working pretty much nonstop

651
00:26:15,188 --> 00:26:16,553
- these days.
- He has been.

652
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:17,630
Well, good for you.

653
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,421
A little hard work
never hurt anybody.

654
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,922
To my son --
now a quarter of a century old.

655
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:26,300
Not bad.
And to his lovely girlfriend --

656
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:28,801
the beautiful and
always witty Rory.

657
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:30,110
Hear, hear.

658
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,472
Here's a little amuse-bouche
with avocado and crabmeat,

659
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:36,782
compliments of the chef.

660
00:26:36,815 --> 00:26:38,392
Oh, tell Markham thanks.

661
00:26:38,426 --> 00:26:39,782
You know the chef here?

662
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:41,400
Yeah, I've known him for...

663
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:44,350
wow... almost 15 years now.

664
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:46,291
Interesting story, actually --

665
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:49,733
he was the sous chef at Le
Bernardin for a bunch of years.

666
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,700
Mmm... that's good.

667
00:26:53,848 --> 00:26:55,082
That's good crab.

668
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:57,723
Anyway, one day,
he just quit --

669
00:26:57,756 --> 00:26:59,213
said he wanted to start
his own restaurant.

670
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:00,861
Everyone thought it was
a bad idea at the time.

671
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:01,983
The odds were against him.

672
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,463
Opening a successful
restaurant in Manhattan

673
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:07,030
is like catching a
firefly in your hand,

674
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:08,603
only a hell of a
lot more expensive.

675
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:10,793
All I can tell you is that
this amuse-bouche is great.

676
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,671
Yes, my mouth is very amused.

677
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:14,642
That's funny.

678
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:16,582
But it was a very gutsy move.

679
00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:17,640
And it paid off.

680
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,883
He caught that firefly.

681
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:20,020
Exactly.

682
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:23,653
So, Rory, tell me -- are you still
planning to pursue journalism?

683
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:28,500
Yes, I have been writing some
articles for an online magazine

684
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:32,350
and I've just applied for the
James Reston reporting fellowship.

685
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,612
You know what you should read?

686
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:35,880
- Philip Meyer's latest book --
- "The vanishing newspaper."

687
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:37,182
I read it. I loved it.

688
00:27:37,218 --> 00:27:38,982
It's an interesting
time in journalism.

689
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:40,852
I'll tell you what
our field needs --

690
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,163
an infusion of bright,
talented people like you, Rory.

691
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:45,800
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

692
00:27:47,535 --> 00:27:50,023
So, dad took his medicine.
He ate half of Sookie's chicken

693
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:52,371
and the entire mango smoothie.
I got three recommendations

694
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:55,650
of personal chefs from Sookie,
two of them I've spoken to on the phone.

695
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:57,703
Thank you.
Why are you doing all this?

696
00:27:57,738 --> 00:27:59,741
I'm trying to help, mom.
I don't want you to be so stressed.

697
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,732
But I am. I'm so stressed.
I can't find anything.

698
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:03,763
What are you looking for?

699
00:28:03,778 --> 00:28:06,502
Your father's accountant
wants all sorts of information

700
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:09,361
so he can file these taxes,
which are apparently due in february.

701
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,510
- Maybe I can help.
- How can you help?

702
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,422
Mom, I have a business.
I helped dad set up this business.

703
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:15,862
I went to business school.

704
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:17,053
Let me see that.

705
00:28:17,497 --> 00:28:18,683
What are you doing?

706
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:20,913
Don't touch the computer.
You could mess something up.

707
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:22,881
Don't worry, mom.
I know what I'm doing.

708
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:26,780
Okay, so he's using Quicken.
A profit and loss statement,

709
00:28:26,815 --> 00:28:29,501
a balance sheet, a schedule asset,
are all things I can pull up here.

710
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:31,852
We can just e-mail them to the
accountant for the 1120.

711
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:33,423
How do you know about 1120s?

712
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:35,150
I have to file
them for the Inn.

713
00:28:35,186 --> 00:28:37,102
The Inn's a corporation
just like dad's company.

714
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:38,863
Why is everything
a corporation?

715
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:41,782
We incorporated so we were
protected from personal liability.

716
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:44,591
If someone was allergic to pillow
mints and wanted to sue me

717
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:46,893
for a million dollars, I wouldn't have
to pay for it out of my own pocket.

718
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:49,182
Your father and I don't have
anyone who wants to sue us.

719
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:51,381
Well, dad probably did
it for tax purposes.

720
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:54,531
It looks like he's got a couple
of different investments,

721
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:56,273
some stocks, a rental building.

722
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:58,161
Would you like a drink?

723
00:28:58,348 --> 00:29:01,122
Mmm, I thought
the house was dry.

724
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:02,783
Vodka or scotch?

725
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:04,632
Wow, it's a regular speakeasy.

726
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:06,081
Would you like a drink or not?

727
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:07,060
Vodka, please.

728
00:29:07,095 --> 00:29:08,620
I have glasses.

729
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:11,681
Serve yourself.

730
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,341
Just because your
father can't drink

731
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,312
doesn't mean the rest
of us should suffer.

732
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:19,260
Cheers.

733
00:29:22,986 --> 00:29:25,191
Ah! That's better.

734
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:28,341
Mom, Christopher
and I split up.

735
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:33,093
Okay.

736
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:39,623
- I hardly know what to say.
- Really? That's great.

737
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:42,220
You don't have to say anything at all --
now or ever.

738
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,332
What's a windmill park?

739
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,790
Uh, it looks like dad owns a couple
of windmills in Palm Springs.

740
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:52,182
We own windmills?

741
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:53,843
They're energy generators.

742
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,682
I had no idea we
owned windmills.

743
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,491
That lamb is terrific.

744
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:03,242
My compliments to the your friend,
the chef.

745
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,120
Well, you're a good orderer.
He's always been a good orderer.

746
00:30:06,155 --> 00:30:09,023
Even when he was 8 years old,
he's always ordered well.

747
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,002
- It's a good skill to have.
- It is, it is.

748
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:13,082
And you know what I should do? I should
just order whatever you're ordering,

749
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:15,063
- no matter what it is.
- Brains it is,

750
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:17,623
followed by sweetbreads and
some rocky mountain oysters.

751
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,953
Oh, this is a business thing,
if you guys don't mind.

752
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,140
Hunzberger here.

753
00:30:21,177 --> 00:30:22,631
No, I haven't
talked to him yet.

754
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,041
"Hunzberger here."

755
00:30:24,078 --> 00:30:26,162
Last year,
if he got a call interrupting dinner,

756
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:28,350
it would be an invitation to
go drink expensive liquor

757
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:30,302
and pull some ridiculous prank.

758
00:30:30,435 --> 00:30:31,623
He's growing up.

759
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:33,062
Yeah, he's doing really great.

760
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,350
He is, and it's because of you.

761
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:37,401
Oh, I don't know about that.

762
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:39,832
No, I know you encouraged
him to go to London.

763
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:43,400
I know you used your influence in a
positive way, and Logan's mother and I...

764
00:30:43,438 --> 00:30:44,580
really appreciate it.

765
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:48,291
Well, I think Logan deserves all
the credit for what he's done.

766
00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:50,302
No, you're too modest, Rory.

767
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:52,912
You've been a real asset to
Logan and to our family.

768
00:30:52,946 --> 00:30:55,012
Oh, well... thanks.

769
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:57,662
I know we've had our
differences in the past.

770
00:30:57,806 --> 00:30:58,390
Yeah.

771
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:02,821
But I'm glad to know that we're
now clearly on the same page.

772
00:31:03,456 --> 00:31:06,360
Okay, yeah. Good.

773
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:08,103
To being on the same page?

774
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:10,052
To being on the same page.

775
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:17,192
I am really glad we got
the chance to talk tonight.

776
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:19,250
In part,
because we still have more work to do.

777
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:20,203
What work?

778
00:31:20,235 --> 00:31:22,813
We have to figure out what
his next step should be.

779
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:25,462
Uh, well,
shouldn't he be figuring that out?

780
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:26,890
Well, you're part
of the team here.

781
00:31:26,907 --> 00:31:28,831
Of course,
we're gonna take care of you, too.

782
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,842
What do you mean?

783
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:31,790
We have newspapers
all around the world.

784
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:33,212
You can take your pick.

785
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:34,481
My pick?

786
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:40,193
Um, I seem to remember you
saying that I didn't have it.

787
00:31:40,228 --> 00:31:42,293
Oh, please. Things change.

788
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:44,270
Circumstances change.

789
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:46,143
Sorry that took so long.
Have you ever noticed

790
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:47,931
that people in Hong
Kong are really chatty?

791
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:48,981
I haven't.

792
00:31:49,018 --> 00:31:51,893
You know what? That's true.
I know a guy from Kowloon, and, man,

793
00:31:51,928 --> 00:31:54,363
is he a loquacious son of a bitch.
Oh, here we go.

794
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:56,113
Apricot and walnut var�nikis

795
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,071
drizzled with a
raspberry reduction.

796
00:31:58,106 --> 00:32:00,610
I told them to make something
special for your birthday.

797
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:01,792
Thanks. It looks great.

798
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:03,091
Happy birthday.

799
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,512
Make a wish.

800
00:32:05,405 --> 00:32:06,823
There we go.

801
00:32:10,626 --> 00:32:13,100
Hey. It's your turn.

802
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:16,583
Hey, aren't we supposed to let her just
cry to toughen her up and whatnot?

803
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:18,722
Isn't that the latest
parenting theory?

804
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:21,142
You only believe in that
theory when it's your turn.

805
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:22,530
All right, all right.

806
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:25,033
I just don't want
her getting too soft.

807
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:27,212
She's got a wrestling
future to think of.

808
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,003
Hey, there, little girl.

809
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:30,481
How are you?

810
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:33,552
How are you?

811
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:37,740
Do you think Luke is lonely?

812
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:38,993
I mean for real.

813
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:41,970
He does look a little
lonely around the eyes.

814
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:43,872
I think he's lovesick
over Lorelai.

815
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,120
Oh, boy.

816
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:46,743
T.J., I'm serious.

817
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:49,470
I just think that he might
be better off lonely.

818
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:51,193
I think they belong together.

819
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:53,313
That's not what you said
when they broke up.

820
00:32:53,345 --> 00:32:55,851
I always thought what you said
then made a lot of sense,

821
00:32:55,887 --> 00:33:00,201
about them being in two different
space-time continuums, something like that.

822
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:01,901
It's all about the wormholes.

823
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,450
Between the dimensions?

824
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,112
Yep, all they've got to do
is find the right wormhole.

825
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,083
I don't know.

826
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:18,702
So, if you want to access your bank and
credit-card account information, you...?

827
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:20,382
Click "cashflow center."

828
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:23,453
Yes, and if you want to
see any of these menus,

829
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:27,101
you right-click right... yes.

830
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:30,562
And if I want the
hidden account bar,

831
00:33:30,597 --> 00:33:33,643
I double-click that arrow
thing up there on the left.

832
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:35,351
Mom, exactly.

833
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:39,211
I don't know how I'm
gonna do all this.

834
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:41,862
Mom, what are you talking about?
You just click, click, click.

835
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,032
You got it all down.

836
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:45,561
Now, but I barely understand
what you've been telling me.

837
00:33:45,596 --> 00:33:47,091
This is your father's job.

838
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,511
Well, he'll be back on
the job soon enough.

839
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:51,833
I don't know. Have you seen him?
He's wearing a dressing gown.

840
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:53,461
I know.
He's watching TV in the bedroom.

841
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:55,263
I know, mom.
You've got to give the guy a break.

842
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:57,742
He's not gonna watch TV
in the bedroom forever.

843
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:00,032
No. No, he's not.

844
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:02,562
Oh, my God,
I don't mean he's gonna die.

845
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:04,371
What are you telling me?
That he's going to live forever?

846
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:05,943
That he's immortal?
Is that what you're telling me?

847
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:09,073
No, I'm just saying,
with time, you know...

848
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:10,573
It's like a canoe.

849
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:13,583
- What's like a canoe?
- Life.

850
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,610
Okay.

851
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:17,321
You're just paddling
along in a canoe.

852
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,240
Mother, have you ever
been in a canoe?

853
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:21,980
I just can't picture
you in a canoe.

854
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:25,083
Your father and I have been paddling
a canoe together for years.

855
00:34:25,118 --> 00:34:27,421
Only now,
he's dropped the paddle.

856
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:28,960
He just dropped it.

857
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:32,291
Not only that,
but now the canoe is going in circles.

858
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,742
Without your father there,
I'm paddling on my side

859
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:37,832
and the canoe is
spinning in circles,

860
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,140
and the harder I paddle,
the faster it spins,

861
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:42,540
and it's hard work,
and I'm getting tired.

862
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:43,912
Dizzy, I would think.

863
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:47,813
You are in a kayak.

864
00:34:47,848 --> 00:34:49,632
You know how to do all of this.

865
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,790
How does that put
me in a kayak?

866
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:54,950
Kayaks have paddles with
things on both ends.

867
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:56,491
You steer it by yourself.

868
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,943
Mom, you know how to
do things by yourself.

869
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:00,722
You are totally capable.

870
00:35:00,756 --> 00:35:03,240
Sure, I went to Smith,
and I was a history major,

871
00:35:03,277 --> 00:35:05,901
but I never had any
plans to be an historian.

872
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:07,960
I was always going
to be a wife.

873
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:11,283
I mean, the way I saw it,
a woman's job was to run a home,

874
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,582
organize the social
life of a family,

875
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:16,192
and bolster her husband
while he earned a living.

876
00:35:16,228 --> 00:35:19,843
It was a good system, and it was
working very well all these years.

877
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:22,623
Only when your husband isn't there
because he's watching television

878
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:26,022
in a dressing gown,
you realize how dependent you are.

879
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,160
I didn't even know
I owned windmills.

880
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:31,271
Mom, now you know,
and you know how to right-click.

881
00:35:31,306 --> 00:35:32,400
But you.

882
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,021
You provide for yourself.

883
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:37,090
You're not dependent on anyone.

884
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:39,110
You're independent.

885
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:41,200
I am kayak, hear me roar.

886
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:42,711
I mean, look at you.

887
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:46,923
For all these years,
you've done very well without a husband.

888
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:48,462
Maybe so,

889
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,933
but I still wanted
it to work out.

890
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:55,322
You know, the way I was raised, if a
married couple split up, it was a disaster,

891
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:57,823
because it meant the
system had fallen apart,

892
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,690
and it was particularly bad for
the woman because she had to go out

893
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,443
and find herself
another rich husband,

894
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:04,183
only she was older now.

895
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:07,333
But with you,
it's not such a disaster, is it?

896
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:08,711
I guess not.

897
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:11,901
It's really not such a horrible thing
that you're going to get a divorce,

898
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,303
not really.

899
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:15,881
Oh, you're gonna be fine.

900
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:19,161
Thanks, mom.

901
00:36:19,196 --> 00:36:22,250
You may even marry someone else someday.
Who knows?

902
00:36:24,286 --> 00:36:25,540
Who knows?

903
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:32,140
Do you know what I think
impressed my dad the most?

904
00:36:32,176 --> 00:36:35,593
You eating a 24-ounce steak. Seriously,
it was, like, a magic trick to him.

905
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,850
It was a pretty
fun dinner, though.

906
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:38,002
Yeah, it was.

907
00:36:38,038 --> 00:36:41,091
Whoa! Look at all this!

908
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:44,443
Ace! Oh, my god,
you got me a pi�ata!

909
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:46,301
Well, you deserve a pi�ata.

910
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,461
I couldn't reach the ceiling,
so I just...

911
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:51,843
- Hey, um, Logan...
- Yeah?

912
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:57,592
Your dad and I had a bit of
a weird conversation tonight.

913
00:36:57,628 --> 00:36:58,642
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

914
00:36:58,678 --> 00:37:03,102
He started thanking me for guiding you
and steering you, or -- I don't know.

915
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:06,633
And then he said that he and I
should start planning your future,

916
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:07,911
like, together.

917
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:10,770
- Well, that's my dad for you.
- Well, it felt really weird.

918
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:13,683
I felt like we were
conspiring or something.

919
00:37:13,716 --> 00:37:15,951
I didn't even agree with
what he was saying.

920
00:37:15,988 --> 00:37:17,830
I ended up toasting.
I toasted him.

921
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:18,801
What did you toast?

922
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,082
"To being on the same
page," which I'm not.

923
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,132
I'm not even on the
same page with him.

924
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:25,962
I actually think that
everything you've accomplished

925
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:28,851
is just because you've worked hard,
and I'm proud of you.

926
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:32,041
I don't even know how the
conversation ended up where it did.

927
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:35,001
It's okay. You know what just happened?
You got Hunzbergered.

928
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:37,582
That's what my dad does to people.
He's a master in manipulating.

929
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:39,280
You sit down,
and you have your own opinions.

930
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,732
By the time you stand up,
you hear yourself agreeing with him,

931
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,682
and you stagger away
confused and queasy.

932
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:46,422
Yes! That's exactly it!
I got Hunzbergered!

933
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:48,070
It happens to the best of us.

934
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:49,872
Well, I'm glad
you're not upset.

935
00:37:49,906 --> 00:37:51,383
No, not at all.

936
00:37:51,418 --> 00:37:54,132
I mean, I don't like the fact that the
guy thinks of me as some kind of puppet,

937
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,971
but pretty soon,
he's gonna have to rethink that one.

938
00:37:57,465 --> 00:37:59,560
You got me twister.
I never had twister.

939
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:00,822
- You didn't?
- No.

940
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:04,420
It was a childhood of deprivation.
Oh, and "Pin the tail on the --"

941
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,740
- What animal is that?
- Oh, that was a donkey.

942
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:08,772
But I messed the ears up,
put antlers on it.

943
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:10,420
Now it's "pin the
tail on the moose."

944
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:12,801
I never had "pin the tail on
the moose" as a boy, either.

945
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:14,142
Poor little rich boy.

946
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:15,891
I think that since
we're short on time,

947
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,583
we should skip to the
classic 12th birthday --

948
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:20,083
ice-skating in central park.

949
00:38:20,115 --> 00:38:21,991
- Sounds good.
- Great. I'll go change.

950
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,502
Hey, Philip, what's up, man?

951
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:28,623
I'm afraid I've
got some grim news.

952
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:30,541
What? What's going on?

953
00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:32,702
I just got off the line with our
lawyers. They say they just got

954
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:34,803
a cease-and-desist letter
from Prism Active,

955
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:38,922
this tech company in Palo Alto, claming
prior art on our media 10 platform.

956
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:41,413
- They're reviewing the patent now, but --
- What do you mean, "prior art"?

957
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:43,302
They're claiming
patent infringement.

958
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:44,920
That's what we bought.
Our patent's pending.

959
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,962
We bought that technology.
That's the entire value of the company.

960
00:38:46,998 --> 00:38:49,242
They're saying it's worthless.
It was already owned.

961
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:52,313
They were just waiting for someone
to buy in before they sued.

962
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:53,532
Oh, my god.

963
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:54,922
I'm so sorry.

964
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:57,190
Happy birthday, man.

965
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:06,290
Okay. Close your eyes.

966
00:39:09,756 --> 00:39:11,250
Are they closed?

967
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,842
They're closed.

968
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:18,753
Okay. Voil�.

969
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:23,360
Wow. It's a giant, furry --
what the hell?

970
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:27,332
It's a russian ushanka,
which also doubles as a birthday crown.

971
00:39:27,637 --> 00:39:29,070
Wow. I bet I look great.

972
00:39:29,107 --> 00:39:30,560
Mmm, you have no idea.

973
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:39,903
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey, T.J.

974
00:39:39,937 --> 00:39:42,592
You know what you could use?
A changing table.

975
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:45,710
Yeah, and if you're getting stuff for
your apartment, you should get a dryer.

976
00:39:45,745 --> 00:39:49,262
Yeah, I'm not getting things.
Why do I need a dryer?

977
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:50,621
Sopping towels.

978
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,350
And why are the towels sopping?

979
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:55,761
My bad. I forgot you said not
to use the garbage disposal.

980
00:39:55,798 --> 00:39:58,551
Well, not forgot, so much as,
I thought you were exaggerating.

981
00:39:58,586 --> 00:39:59,981
I wasn't exaggerating.

982
00:40:00,015 --> 00:40:01,770
And we have more bad news.

983
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:02,690
Oh, yeah?

984
00:40:02,728 --> 00:40:05,861
The exterminator said the moths
turned out to be rice moths.

985
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:08,320
And this means you'll be
staying how much longer?

986
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:10,130
Which means we're
headed home right now.

987
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:11,881
Most of the stuff's
already in the car.

988
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:14,971
Rice moths are a snap to get rid of.
They're already gone.

989
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:17,951
It's just a bummer to leave, 'cause
we've been having such a good time.

990
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:21,871
Yeah, but Doula should
be in her own home.

991
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:23,971
That's what we thought,
plus your mattress.

992
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,442
Not so comfortable,
shall we say.

993
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:27,071
Yeah, well, sorry about that.

994
00:40:27,187 --> 00:40:29,511
No worries, no worries, but...

995
00:40:29,547 --> 00:40:32,473
put it on the list of things
you're gonna fix around here.

996
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:33,551
- All right, then.
- All right.

997
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:34,983
- Thanks again.
- Okay.

998
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,161
Your casa is my casa.
For that, I'm grateful.

999
00:40:38,195 --> 00:40:41,161
You take care and call if
you're feeling lonely.

1000
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:42,580
We will come and visit.

1001
00:40:42,618 --> 00:40:44,362
- Okay, anytime.
- Sounds great.

1002
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:46,130
Anytime, I mean it.

1003
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:49,082
- Bye.
- Bye.

1004
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:07,743
Good morning.

1005
00:41:07,776 --> 00:41:09,320
Good morning.
Would you like some coffee?

1006
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:10,392
Yes.

1007
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:12,551
Oh, I woke up this morning,
and I've got to say,

1008
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:15,913
for the first time in my life, I got
where the teetotalers are coming from.

1009
00:41:15,945 --> 00:41:18,252
If I had a hatchet
and a barrel of booze,

1010
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:19,592
forget about it.

1011
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:22,030
What are you up to today?

1012
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:26,343
Today? I'm going to attend a D.A.R.
lecture on the native american artwork.

1013
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:29,570
Then I have a lunch with Sarah
Montgomery Brown and Melissa Seria,

1014
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:32,460
and, of course, I'll have my
hands full canceling the party.

1015
00:41:32,497 --> 00:41:34,341
I've already called the
florist and the hall.

1016
00:41:34,377 --> 00:41:36,473
We'll only get 60%
of our deposit back,

1017
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:38,722
but that's better than nothing.

1018
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,253
I should go.

1019
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:45,082
I need time to change before
I have to go to the Inn.

1020
00:41:45,117 --> 00:41:46,330
Fine.

1021
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:49,812
Thank you for your help with
the quicken last night.

1022
00:41:51,257 --> 00:41:52,570
You're welcome.
