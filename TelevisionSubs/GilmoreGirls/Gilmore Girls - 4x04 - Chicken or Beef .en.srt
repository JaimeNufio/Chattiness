1
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,187
Oh, crap!

2
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:36,264
What's going on? Is it the smoke detector? Are we on fire?

3
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,933
It's not the smoke detector, it's the alarm!

4
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:39,730
- What alarm? 
- Our alarm.

5
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,088
We don't have an alarm.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,369
Then, we have really angry rats. Did you cut your hair?

7
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:46,413
I just trimmed it.

8
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:48,476
You didn't tell me you were cutting your hair.

9
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:49,806
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

10
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:53,289
A spur-of-the-moment, "let's not tell my mother I'm pulling a G.I. Jane"?

11
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:56,500
Are we seriously gonna have this conversation now during the air raid?

12
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:57,364
You're right. Come on.

13
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:58,389
What are we doing?

14
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:01,702
I figured out that there is a motion detector, and if you stand over here,

15
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,202
it can't see you and calms down.

16
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:06,213
- Great, so what now? 
- We wait.

17
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:09,592
So why didn't you tell me you were getting your hair cut?

18
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:12,520
- It's just a trim. 
- To the Braille Institute, it's just a trim.

19
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:14,549
- Do you like it? 
- Will you put it back if I don't?

20
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:15,182
Mom!

21
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:16,668
- Yes, I like it. 
- Thank you.

22
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,428
Oh, thank God.

23
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,235
Feels good when it's over, huh?

24
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,264
This is crazy. When did we get an alarm?

25
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:24,877
- Well, apparently, Kirk... 
- Oh, no.

26
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:27,491
...has recently joined the Stars Hollow Security Company. 

27
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:30,530
And apparently, now that I'm the pretty spinster living all alone,

28
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:33,171
- he's concerned for my safety. 
- Did he tell you all this?

29
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:35,383
Do you think I labeled myself the pretty spinster?

30
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:37,508
- What did you say? 
- I haven't talked to him face-to-face.

31
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:42,343
I come home to this and there was a note and his card and his gun.

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,397
Oh, jeez!

33
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,208
Yeah, and then when I called the alarm-response center to complain about the alarm,

34
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,458
no one answered.

35
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:51,272
I had to leave a message with Meg - she sweeps up.

36
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,849
I can't even believe there's a security company in Stars Hollow.

37
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:55,142
Nothing ever happens here.

38
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,946
- Oh, that is not true. Plenty happens here.
- Like what?

39
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:01,206
Like, people now break into your houses and install alarm systems.

40
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:02,281
I heard about that.

41
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:03,724
- And we have a new mail carrier. 
- We do?

42
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:05,900
Yeah, so now if you wanna get your mail, you just have to go see Miss Patty.

43
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:07,467
- Why? 
- 'Cause that's where he brings it.

44
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:10,069
He brings Babette's mail to Andrew's, Norma's mail to the deli,

45
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:13,111
and Taylor still hasn't found his mail, which I have to admit is kind of fun.

46
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,233
I rescind my previous statement. This place is hopping.

47
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,703
- So, did you eat yet? 
- Nope.

48
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:19,398
- I thought I'd let you feed me. 
- Sure.

49
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:22,440
I can feed you, but I can't know if you're getting your hair cut.

50
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:25,051
I will never do anything again without telling you - happy?

51
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:27,545
I don't know. I'm finding this whole guilt thing rather satisfying.

52
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:28,825
No, no, where are you going?

53
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:32,096
- Why did you do that? 
- I was gonna get my laundry!

54
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:34,596
- You made it mad! 
- I didn't mean to!

55
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,111
Back in the corner, back in the corner!

56
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:42,031
- No place like home, huh? 
- Yeah.

57
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,776
- Mom? 
- Follow the Post-It's.

58
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:50,842
Does our life seem at all ridiculous to you?

59
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,890
I spent all morning carefully tracking that motion detector.

60
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,722
What an excellent use of your time.

61
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,314
We're good as long as we stay on the path.

62
00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:59,541
So I should follow the yellow stick road?

63
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:02,891
We'll be here all week, try the veal. Stop.

64
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,217
- What? 
- Read.

65
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:07,120
"Crouch down and hop." Oh, come on.

66
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:11,021
The motion-detector beam at the top of the staircase dips very low over there.

67
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:12,811
You seriously want me to crouch down and hop?

68
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:14,360
Like a little hunchbacked bunny.

69
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,911
You know, I had decided that if I ever went to therapy,

70
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,626
- I was gonna leave you out of it, but now... 
- Okay, you can stand up.

71
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,447
Did you at least call the stupid security company again?

72
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:26,187
Yes, Meg sends her love.

73
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,252
Don't worry - I'll stop by on my way to the inn.

74
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:30,582
And what are your plans today, Persis Khambata?

75
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:33,464
Well, today, I'm going to do nothing but hang out in town,

76
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:36,925
read, veg, drink coffee, and have the perfect Stars Hollow day.

77
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:40,080
Look out. I get to go over to the inn

78
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:42,681
and hear a contractor laugh at me every time I say,

79
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,216
"But that won't cost too much more, right?"

80
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:45,773
- Enjoy. 
- Late lunch at Luke's?

81
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:46,470
You're on.

82
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,896
So, which way do I go?

83
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:50,936
Oh, just follow the Post-It's.

84
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:52,521
But they're going in two different directions.

85
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,941
- They are? 
- Look.

86
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:56,781
Oh. I must have kicked some out of the way by accident.

87
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,851
- Well, which one do I take? 
- Which looks more intentional?

88
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:01,928
- No Post-It path looks intentional. 
- I'm drawing a complete blank.

89
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:03,622
- You seriously don't remember? 
- Sorry.

90
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:05,999
Well, how are we supposed to get out of our house?

91
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,330
I hate Kirk.

92
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,569
Whoa. What's going on?

93
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:36,064
I'm just setting things up for tomorrow.

94
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,277
- Oh, tomorrow. What's... 
- Heads up!

95
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:41,898
I think you may need to move.

96
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,743
Yeah, I kinda got that. Excuse me. What's tomorrow?

97
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,785
...tons of tulle so that everything looks like frosting.

98
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,401
She's our only daughter - frost the town.

99
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,981
Now, where should we put the poster? I want to make sure everybody sees it.

100
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:56,838
- Oh, what about next to the cake? 
- Yes, next to the cake.

101
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:04,478
- Lane. 
- Rory.

102
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,997
Have you heard of a phone? Because as my friend,

103
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,781
it is your responsibility to use it to call me and tell me

104
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:13,360
that my ex-boyfriend's wedding is on Sunday so I'm not accidentally in it.

105
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:13,990
What?

106
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:16,270
I'm sitting out in the gazebo, reading,

107
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:19,501
and this guy almost brains me with a stack of tablecloths.

108
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:22,280
Oh, that's right, they're having their reception in the town square.

109
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,950
Yes, and Lindsay was out there holding a giant picture of her with Dean, and...

110
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:28,205
Oh my God, did she see you?

111
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:30,582
I don't think so. I do a pretty good idiot run when I need to.

112
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:33,755
I'm sorry, I meant to tell you. I just didn't know you were coming home this weekend.

113
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,325
It totally slipped my mind. Things have been so crazy.

114
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:39,454
I just figured I'd tell you when we talked, and then we didn't, and...

115
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:41,451
oh, I'm sorry, can you hold on for a sec?

116
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,247
- Not cool, Lane. 
- I'm sorry, guys.

117
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:50,228
- Fourth time today. 
- Well, I thought Rory was my mom.

118
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,856
The resemblance is uncanny.

119
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,933
We should get your mom a bell like a cat.

120
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:56,131
- What's going on? 
- We're having a band meeting.

121
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:59,209
- We need to figure out what to do about a guitarist. 
- I think I got a splinter.

122
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,651
You know that a splinter can get into your bloodstream,

123
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:03,049
go straight to your heart, and kill you.

124
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,169
Why would you tell me that?

125
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:07,395
- Whatever, dude. This is lame. I'm gonna bail. 
- Zach, come on.

126
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,131
- We need to find a guitarist. 
- That's right.

127
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,173
We have come too far to let the band fall apart just because Dave...

128
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,953
Hey, do not say the "d" word, Lane.

129
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:15,798
- But... 
- Don't.

130
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:17,058
- Dave... 
- Dave is dead to me.

131
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:21,334
Comprendo? Dead. Cover the mirror, rip a shirt, that guy doesn't exist.

132
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,113
- He just went to college, Zach. 
- No, he did not just go to college.

133
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:25,674
He walked out on his art, man.

134
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,396
He walked out on his sound.

135
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,093
Do you think a sound is so easy to find? Did you ever see that Glenn Miller movie?

136
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:33,351
For two hours, Jimmy Stewart's walking around,

137
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,264
"I gotta find a sound. I gotta find a sound."

138
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:39,608
We had a sound and Dave took that sound to freaking California.

139
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:42,741
You don't come back from California, man. It changes you.

140
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,682
What did you expect him to do - not go to college?

141
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,749
No true rock 'n' roller goes to college!

142
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:48,706
Mick Jagger went to the London School of Economics.

143
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:49,586
What?

144
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:54,988
Yeah, and, Dexter Holland of The Offspring got his PhD in molecular biology at USC.

145
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:57,549
Greg Ginn of Black Flag graduated from UCLA.

146
00:07:57,713 --> 00:08:01,319
The guy from Bad Religion got his masters in geology from UCLA,

147
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:05,055
and he's working on his PhD in evolutionary biology at Cornell.

148
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:06,859
Lane, she's your friend.

149
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,967
I'm sorry. I'm going. I'll call you later.

150
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,772
Hey, are you mad?

151
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:14,097
No, I'm not, I promise.

152
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:17,918
I'm just... a little surprised. I mean, Dean's wedding...

153
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:20,580
- I know. 
- But it's okay.

154
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,888
It just means that I have to be a little more careful about where I go this weekend, that's all.

155
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:25,419
Okay, well, I'll see you tomorrow.

156
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:28,512
- We're using the garage - guitar auditions. 
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

157
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:31,701
Shut up, shut up, shut up. Weezer did not go to Harvard.

158
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,620
- Not the whole band, just the lead... 
- Get away from me! I mean it.

159
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,934
- Bye. 
- Bye.

160
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:54,355
- Were you... 
- Oh, I was at Lane's.

161
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,348
Right, Lane's.

162
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,480
So, you're home this weekend.

163
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:02,495
Yeah, I ran out of clean clothes and quarters, so...

164
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:06,023
- How are things? 
- Good. You?

165
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,057
- Good. 
- You like Yale?

166
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,356
- I love Yale. 
- I figured.

167
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:11,645
- And Connecticut State? 
- It's good.

168
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,663
Oh, good. I'm glad it's good.

169
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:16,166
I mean, not that I would have had any recourse if it wasn't, but...

170
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:18,777
this makes my lack of recourse a lot easier to deal with.

171
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,476
So, I see you've taken over the town.

172
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,127
Oh, yeah. Lindsay thought... she likes the gazebo, and...

173
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:26,689
- And it's her wedding. 
- It is her wedding.

174
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:28,716
And your wedding. I mean, it's your wedding, too.

175
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,097
Yes, it is. It's my wedding, too.

176
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:33,877
Well, it's nice. It's... it's pretty.

177
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:37,005
It looks like heaven or a Victoria's Secret commercial,

178
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:38,875
which, to some people is basically the same thing.

179
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,537
I didn't know you'd be home this weekend.

180
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,668
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

181
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,447
Because if I had known, I would have, you know, invited you.

182
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,725
Oh. Oh, well, it's...

183
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,511
I mean, I didn't want you to think I was just not inviting you.

184
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:55,362
- No, I didn't think that. 
- I just figured you'd be at school.

185
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,011
- 'Cause you're logical. 
- I just didn't know.

186
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:58,706
- No, I know you didn't know. 
- I didn't want you to think...

187
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,901
No, I didn't think. I don't think. I go to Yale now. They think for you.

188
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:08,742
- But, hey, since you are here, come. 
- Come?

189
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:10,140
To my wedding. Come to my wedding.

190
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,309
- Oh, Dean... 
- You and Lorelai, I want you to.

191
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:14,491
- Well... 
- Chicken or beef?

192
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:16,485
- What? 
- Wait, beef.

193
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:19,914
Of course, beef. I mean, the two of you are definitely beef.

194
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:22,582
I mean, not like you resemble beef or anything.

195
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:26,125
- You know, you don't even have to... 
- Okay, so, noon at the church.

196
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:27,666
I'll be the one in the tux.

197
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,410
And don't worry, we didn't write our own vows and no one's singing opera.

198
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:33,826
- I know you think that's lame. 
- Oh, no, well, it's a wedding.

199
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:36,422
It's supposed to be... operatic.

200
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:39,131
Okay, so, I better get over there. Lindsay's expecting me.

201
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,548
So, I'll just see you two tomorrow.

202
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:42,782
But...

203
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:51,026
- Now? 
- Nothing.

204
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:54,067
- What about now? 
- No, nothing.

205
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:58,036
- Okay. Now? 
- Nothing.

206
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:59,802
Kirk, what's supposed to happen?

207
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:01,241
What?

208
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:03,192
I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for.

209
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:06,329
- Kirk? 
- I'm not sure.

210
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,150
- Kirk, please come downstairs. 
- Are you going to hurt me?

211
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:11,332
Kirk.

212
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,195
I swear, they told me it would be self-explanatory.

213
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:17,872
I just had to get in the main box, and in seconds, this thing would be disabled.

214
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:20,636
They didn't tell me that I needed a key or that if I didn't have a key,

215
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,830
that I would be mildly electrocuted, and then, after all that,

216
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:26,831
when I got in the box, there's nothing self-explanatory about it.

217
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:27,706
Kirk.

218
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:29,638
- I was trying to do a nice thing. 
- I know.

219
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:33,175
And Jimmy said he would install it for me because I do not have those skills yet.

220
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:34,779
The class was full by the time I got there.

221
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:37,041
- That's okay. 
- Damn my constant tardiness.

222
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,375
Kirk, please, what can we do right now? The alarm is just so loud.

223
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:43,375
Yeah, that's my fault, too. I asked Jimmy to really crank it up.

224
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:44,241
Well, he did.

225
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:46,038
If you're gonna have an alarm, you need it loud.

226
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:49,299
You don't want some crazed, knife-wielding gunman at your throat

227
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:53,205
and the neighbors are going, like, "Is that a fan? Did I leave the water running?"

228
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:54,978
You want them to know, "Hey, that's an alarm."

229
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:57,078
Your imaginary attacker has a knife and a gun?

230
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:59,326
- And a really dirty tank top. 
- Okay.

231
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,750
So, Jimmy's out of town, but until he gets back, we can...

232
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,179
- Change the code. 
- Really? To something I know?

233
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,144
- You can pick it. 
- You know how to do that?

234
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:08,798
- Yes, I do. 
- That is perfect.

235
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:11,977
Okay, here we go. Just punch in a 7-number sequence.

236
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:12,909
You got it.

237
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:16,985
- Did you know your phone's not working? 
- What?

238
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:19,699
I've been calling you for an hour. I had the operator check it.

239
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,089
- She said it's cut off or something. 
- It was working this morning.

240
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,872
- I'll be right back. 
- Kirk!

241
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:24,840
I have tape.

242
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:27,226
- You look tired. 
- Yeah, well, Kirk.

243
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,945
Right. Hey, listen, I got a call today.

244
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:33,237
- From? 
- Michel. A very upset Michel.

245
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:33,949
Why?

246
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:36,836
Apparently, he called you and you never called him back.

247
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:38,214
When did he call me?

248
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:40,108
He said he called you in July.

249
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:41,814
I was in Europe in July.

250
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,368
I think that he thinks we're trying to ease him out of the Dragonfly.

251
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:46,939
Oh, come on. Why would he think that?

252
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:49,053
I don't know, but he was so hysterical

253
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:51,732
that his voice got into that high-pitched squeal he does,

254
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:54,441
and all I could make out was "fire" and "abandon me"

255
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:58,224
and something about not receiving a thank-you card for the Statue of Liberty.

256
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,913
That is crazy. He knows we always intended to take him with us.

257
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:03,805
I mean, we love Michel, right?

258
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:07,405
Right. He's the best concierge in the world.

259
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,378
Absolutely.

260
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,337
- A little abrasive. 
- Kind of impatient.

261
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:14,106
- But charming. 
- And great at what he does, knows the community.

262
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:18,709
- Willing to go that extra mile. 
- Tiny bit obnoxious.

263
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:23,078
Makes you want to scream, "life's too short!" two, three times a day, but...

264
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:24,215
Picture life without him.

265
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:28,956
We do need him, right?

266
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:30,805
- Let's just go down there and talk to him. 
- Right.

267
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:38,332
Well, we know where all those Calvin Klein ads went to die.

268
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:40,384
They look like they all had the same mother.

269
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:42,335
That must be one tired supermodel.

270
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,635
Excuse me, we're look...

271
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,409
I wouldn't talk to us either.

272
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:47,656
Hey, talk to a boy. A boy will be nice to you.

273
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,786
Excuse me, we're looking for Michel Gerard.

274
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,814
- The corner of Mercer and Broom. 
- Excuse me?

275
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,932
Oh, Janet Jackson's on the phone.

276
00:13:58,142 --> 00:13:59,914
No worries. Hi.

277
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:01,464
- Us? 
- Yes.

278
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:04,211
- We're looking for Michel Gerard. 
- Michel.

279
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:05,454
Yes, Michel Ger...

280
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,296
- Janet again. 
- She's very needy lately.

281
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:09,781
You have some guests at the front desk.

282
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:13,207
No worries. He comes like the wind.

283
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,036
Thanks.

284
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,430
- He doesn't need our thanks. 
- Well, he has Janet, so...

285
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:20,957
You have reservations at Tamtam at 7:00.

286
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,013
Do not order the duck because it will take forever and you will miss the curtain.

287
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,927
If you have any problems at all, you have my pager number.

288
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:29,878
Just call me. Goodbye.

289
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:32,945
Well, look who the cat dragged in.

290
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,265
Hi, Michel. We've missed you.

291
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,637
Yes? Well, I have missed you, too.

292
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,013
This place is wonderful.

293
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:41,813
You look so important, walking around, talking to yourself.

294
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,902
But you're not really talking to yourself.

295
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,287
You're actually talking to someone else in a headset with your headset.

296
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:51,578
- How are you? 
- Me? I am wonderful, and yourselves?

297
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:54,982
We're great, and we're breaking ground on the inn on Monday.

298
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:58,783
- Oh, yes. Is that still happening? 
- It is still happening.

299
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:00,293
Well, that's lovely.

300
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:02,397
There's a small charge for the use of the internet.

301
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,500
All instructions are in the minibar. I'm so pleased.

302
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,394
Listen, Michel, I know you're a little upset with me.

303
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:10,211
- Upset? I don't think so. 
- It's okay, I told her about the call.

304
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:12,141
- What call? 
- The call you made to me yesterday,

305
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:15,628
the one where you told me that you called Lorelai and she didn't call back.

306
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:18,404
- I make so many calls. 
- The one where you cried.

307
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:20,892
Are you sure it wasn't another Michel?

308
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:23,722
You called me! You kept me on the phone for over an hour.

309
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:26,213
I missed the beginning of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, and by the time

310
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:28,469
- I got back, they were all gay. 
- Okay, it doesn't matter.

311
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:30,691
We just want you to know if there was any misunderstanding

312
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,863
about wanting you to come with us to the Dragonfly,

313
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,440
- well, we're sorry. 
- I'm not.

314
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:37,293
Well, that's very sweet of you to say. Thank you.

315
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,691
Unless you don't want to come with us.

316
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:43,743
I mean, this place is very impressive, and I would understand if you didn't want to leave.

317
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:46,068
Yes, this place is impressive, isn't it?

318
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:49,529
I mean, the uniform alone - like working in your jammies.

319
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:51,797
And these headsets, are they not fabulous?

320
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:54,926
Especially when, for example, you're in the bathroom,

321
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,141
a place one would normally choose to be alone, then suddenly, bang,

322
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,275
someone is yakking in your ear. How delightful.

323
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,380
- You can never get lonely. 
- I suppose not.

324
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:06,150
And the people who work here... a joy.

325
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:11,582
So young, so talented. Some of them are actors in ambitious off-Broadway revues.

326
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:17,532
They play cockroaches and derelicts and do Shakespeare dressed like punk rockers.

327
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:19,191
It gives me chills just thinking about it.

328
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:22,350
Yes, extra towels are complimentary, Matthew, and stop asking me

329
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:24,429
who the hottie I'm talking to is. I'll tell you what,

330
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,256
I'll think about it and get back to you, okay?

331
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:29,760
- Nice to have you aboard, Michel. 
- I'm busy, go.

332
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:34,802
Thank God.

333
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,580
Matthew, what?

334
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:40,236
- So, he invited us to his wedding. 
- And we're having beef.

335
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,160
- What was his body language like? 
- Tall.

336
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:46,390
No, I mean, did he squirm or back away

337
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:48,172
when he invited you or was he all darty-eyed?

338
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:52,862
Not much squirming, no backing away, but there was a little bit of darty-eye.

339
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:55,248
- So, he was nervous. 
- Well, we were both nervous.

340
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,623
I mean, we didn't expect to run into each other, and I think he probably just invited us

341
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,444
- 'cause he felt like he had to, to be nice. 
- That does sound like Dean.

342
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:02,714
So, what do we do? Do we go?

343
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:05,197
Oh, I can't decide this. He's your ex-boyfriend.

344
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:07,814
- It seems weird that we go. 
- Then we don't go.

345
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:11,378
But if we don't go, it may look like we're trying to make some kind of statement.

346
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:12,202
Then we go.

347
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:14,506
If I had just stayed at Lane's for two more minutes...

348
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,898
- Yeah, fate. 
- Yes, it is fate.

349
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,874
- Do we ignore fate? 
- I don't know.

350
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:20,834
- Do you have any important papers due soon? 
- Why?

351
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,238
- Just in case. 
- Fate's gonna flunk me?

352
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,133
- It's always a possibility. 
- Well, then that's it. We are going.

353
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,524
- Going where? 
- Dean's wedding. Fate's making us.

354
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:29,601
I hope fate will cough up forty bucks for a salad spinner for him.

355
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:30,973
Please, there is no fate.

356
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:34,128
What do you mean there is no fate? Of course there is fate.

357
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:37,128
There is no fate, there is no destiny, there is no luck.

358
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:39,073
Astrology is ridiculous.

359
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:41,635
Tarot cards tell you nothing. You cannot read a palm.

360
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:43,620
Tea leaves make tea and nothing else.

361
00:17:43,703 --> 00:17:47,825
Jim Morrison is not hanging out with Elvis, and the Kennedys did not kill Marilyn.

362
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:50,763
- I totally knew you were gonna say that. 
- I came over here. My fault.

363
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:53,406
I read your mind. It spoke to me. We're psychic.

364
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:54,425
Enjoy the fries.

365
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,074
So where does this leave us?

366
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,729
Well, I think that Dean's gonna expect us to go, and it is his day,

367
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,795
and I don't want him to feel like I don't care about him.

368
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:03,928
- I know. 
- I just want him to be happy.

369
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:07,272
Okay, we'll get him a salad spinner first thing tomorrow morning.

370
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:08,024
Thank you.

371
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:13,078
- Oh, there you are. Honey, I've got your mail. 
- Oh, great.

372
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:17,866
Oh, I'm exhausted. I've been looking all over town for you.

373
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,734
Oh, Patty, you could have just left me a message.

374
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:20,774
I would have stopped by and picked it up.

375
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:22,745
Oh, there was something marked urgent in there,

376
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,112
and I just wanted to make sure you got it.

377
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,905
Thank you.

378
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,650
All right, I'm leaving.

379
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:32,407
Oh, I'm gonna kill that mail carrier. I don't care if he doesn't have a tongue.

380
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:35,126
Our new mail carrier doesn't have a tongue?

381
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,621
- You've got to be kidding me. 
- That's what Patty just said.

382
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:40,732
No, Taylor has sent me a cease and desist order on the inn.

383
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:41,532
What?

384
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,336
"Dear Lorelai Gilmore, it has come to the attention

385
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:46,265
of the Stars Hollow Historical Preservation Society that you and Miss Sookie St. James 

386
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,033
intend to commence construction on the Dragonfly Inn.

387
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:52,392
Any proposed renovations must be submitted, discussed, and approved

388
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,465
by the Stars Hollow Historical Preservation Society.

389
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:57,307
We must therefore ask that all work halt until such time

390
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:58,486
that this procedure has been followed. 

391
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,675
- Thank you, and have a historical day." Is he kidding? 
- What are you gonna do?

392
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,346
- I'm going to talk to him. 
- Cool.

393
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:07,225
Don't say cool like that. It's gonna be very pleasant.

394
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,711
I thought you said you were gonna go talk to Taylor.

395
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:10,631
I own my own business now, Rory.

396
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:13,432
I'm gonna have to deal with tiny men like Taylor all the time.

397
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,188
You can't go around yelling at people, no matter how historical they might be.

398
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:17,840
Bummer.

399
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:21,234
You have to learn to separate the personal from the business.

400
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:27,133
Remember in The Godfather, Michael telling Sonny how he was gonna kill Tattaglia

401
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,084
and Captain McCluskey in that Italian restaurant?

402
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:32,442
He lays out the whole thing very calmly, very unemotionally,

403
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:34,025
'cause that's what you do in business.

404
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,940
Yeah, but then he went and shot two guys in the head.

405
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,162
Okay, but I wasn't describing that scene.

406
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:42,576
But if you know you already like lime, then you're not sampling,

407
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:45,402
you're savoring, and that's just gluttonous.

408
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:49,790
- Hi, Taylor. 
- Well, hello there.

409
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:51,675
Lorelai, Rory, what can I get for you?

410
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:55,837
Oh, well, gosh, look at all the choices, really hard to pick.

411
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:59,529
I think I'll try a scoop of butter brickle crunch. Rory?

412
00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:02,094
- I'll try the chocolate chocolate chocolate. 
- Coming right up.

413
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:03,918
Listen, Taylor, while I have you here,

414
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:08,183
I received this letter in the mail, and I'm having kind of a blond day,

415
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:09,785
and I wonder if you could explain this to me.

416
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:14,117
Well, it says you have to get approval before you can start construction on the inn.

417
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,396
That's what I thought it said.

418
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,769
I have to tell you, Taylor, I'm a little concerned

419
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:21,598
because we have a construction crew coming Monday, so... yikes.

420
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:24,660
The Dragonfly is a historical building, Lorelai.

421
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:27,357
Yeah, but the whole town is a historical building, Taylor.

422
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:31,147
I mean, George Washington ate, slept, or blew his nose all over the damn place.

423
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:33,589
He only blew his nose in the park. You've read the sign.

424
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:36,206
Taylor, that inn needs love. It's falling down.

425
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,083
Sookie and I have no intention of ruining its historical aspect.

426
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:43,037
- We'd just like some running water. 
- Running water was not always historical.

427
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:44,987
You're not seriously telling me I can't put in running water?

428
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:47,849
Oh, my God, this is incredible.

429
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:49,596
It's called chocolate chocolate chocolate,

430
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:52,631
but it's seriously chocolate chocolate chocolaty.

431
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:54,157
Sorry.

432
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,527
I'm just telling you, there are rules and they have to be followed.

433
00:20:58,203 --> 00:20:59,089
Fine.

434
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:04,660
What do I have to do to get the Historical Preservation Society's stamp of approval?

435
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,207
- Well, a formal presentation is necessary. 
- When?

436
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:12,346
Any town function or gathering is open to a presentation, Lorelai.

437
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:14,905
- Okay, so, like, the town meeting tonight? 
- If you like.

438
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:18,617
- The town meeting it is. 
- Oh, now, don't look sad.

439
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,795
I went through this with my place, too.

440
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:24,311
Of course, I knew the rules so I didn't get the embarrassing letter.

441
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:27,123
Right, okay, great. Well, we'll see you later, Taylor.

442
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:29,892
Yes?

443
00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:31,522
That'll be $3.50 for the ice cream.

444
00:21:31,797 --> 00:21:33,359
And worth every penny, let me tell you.

445
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,617
Sorry, but this is really good.

446
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,923
So, any additional landscaping to the town square

447
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:42,852
will be paid for directly from the town park funds,

448
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:46,712
and town park funds only. All righty.

449
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:50,512
- Long one tonight. 
- Astonishingly long.

450
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:52,400
- We've got to be next, right? 
- We've got to be.

451
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:55,161
Michel, are you okay over there?

452
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,563
He says the guy next to him has unforgivable B.O.

453
00:21:57,752 --> 00:21:59,196
Michel, you're French. How can you even tell?

454
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,649
Could we have a little quiet please?

455
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,297
Sorry, Taylor, we're just waiting here very patiently,

456
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:05,397
as you can see, all ready and everything.

457
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:10,681
Yes, well, the next item, people, is a wonderful feather in Stars Hollow's cap.

458
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,528
One of our very own, fourth grader Donny Pass,

459
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:17,788
was named a runner-up in the Connecticut State story-writing contest

460
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:21,146
for his work entitled The Happiest Doughnut.

461
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:23,164
I think I'm gonna give birth just out of boredom.

462
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:26,053
Donny's mom is here tonight. Let's give her a big hand.

463
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:29,170
I almost think he's doing this on purpose.

464
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:32,109
- Almost? 
- Bordering on pretty damn sure.

465
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,375
I won't spoil the plot of The Happiest Doughnut for you, folks,

466
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:38,971
except to say it's funny and a little sad and truly inspiring.

467
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,510
But a caveat for all you parents -

468
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:44,895
the dunking scene may be too intense for preschool-aged children.

469
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,779
How can a stupid doughnut be happy?

470
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,133
But see, he's got you curious. That's the genius of Donny Pass.

471
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:52,473
Hey, I've got a bunch of your mail. Here.

472
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:54,669
Oh, I've got some of yours, too, and some of Al's.

473
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:57,670
Will you pass this back to him for me?

474
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:00,701
- Yeah. Oh, if you hand this up to Andrew. 
- Can do.

475
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,375
I can't smell anything.

476
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:12,566
I'm breathing it all in so it's not reaching you.

477
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:14,879
Thanks for taking that grenade for me, pal.

478
00:23:15,064 --> 00:23:17,475
People, could we have some order here?

479
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:20,225
Oh, Gypsy, the letter from my girlfriend's open.

480
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:23,818
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Andrew. It must have fallen open accidentally.

481
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:26,507
- You read my private letter. 
- There's nothing private in that letter.

482
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:28,316
Except for the medical stuff.

483
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:31,095
Taylor, I got your PennySaver and your girly magazines.

484
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:33,800
Those are lifestyle magazines.

485
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:38,336
People, this meeting has degenerated into our usual weekly anarchy.

486
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:40,460
I say we adjourn. We'll see you next week.

487
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:41,890
- What? 
- Taylor!

488
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:45,330
Everyone pick up a free copy of The Happiest Doughnut on your way out.

489
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:46,661
- You won't be sorry. 
- Taylor, wait,

490
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,041
we were supposed to make our presentation about the Dragonfly.

491
00:23:49,186 --> 00:23:51,801
Oh, yes. Well, you're bringing this up kind of late.

492
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,537
- We've been sitting here. 
- It won't take long.

493
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:56,118
It was your idea, remember? You suggested this.

494
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:58,043
Well, okay.

495
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:01,854
People, your children and elderly are going to have to wait

496
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,590
a while longer for you to get home because Lorelai Gilmore and her associates

497
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:11,265
want to discuss some proposed changes to a beloved town structure.

498
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:13,487
Thank you. Let's go, Sook, Augustus Gloop.

499
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:14,730
Knock 'em dead.

500
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:20,158
Guys, I know we've been here forever, but I very quickly want to tell you

501
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:24,602
what we have in mind for this beautiful Dragonfly property.

502
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,393
- The historic Dragonfly property. 
- I think that goes without saying.

503
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:30,091
I don't think you should try to hide the fact that it's historic.

504
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:32,513
- Okay, I'm not hiding anything. 
- Proceed, please.

505
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:36,946
- Okay, well, we're very excited... 
- How many guest rooms will this establishment have?

506
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:38,216
Ten.

507
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,438
Yeah, ten. Anyway, the property's been unoccupied for...

508
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:44,469
And parking? How many parking spaces?

509
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:45,959
Eighteen.

510
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:49,052
Something wrong with the parking, Taylor?

511
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:51,623
Two people to a room, each with their own car,

512
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:53,388
that's twenty cars - you don't have enough parking.

513
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:56,086
But some of the people will be driving there together in one car.

514
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:59,508
- So, you have a crystal ball, do you? 
- That's just common sense.

515
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,517
Because if you have a crystal ball, I sure would like to borrow it to take to the racetrack.

516
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:07,449
No, I don't have a crystal ball, but if the parking's not enough,

517
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:09,323
- we can always add more. 
- Easy.

518
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:13,010
- So, pave paradise and put up a parking lot. 
- Not what we're saying.

519
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:15,370
I heard you were planning to serve alcohol - is this true?

520
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:17,971
- Well, there will be a restaurant. 
- Wine, cocktails.

521
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:21,392
- Give the people what they want. 
- So it'll be a party spot, huh?

522
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:25,344
Catering to that crowd - hip-hoppers, the Manson family.

523
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:26,706
It's a little country inn.

524
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,866
A perfect secluded spot for murderers to revel in impropriety.

525
00:25:29,984 --> 00:25:32,919
Have you noticed, this is not going very well.

526
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,165
Taylor, everyone, there will be millions of questions,

527
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,027
some of them even legitimate, but the bottom line is, you know me.

528
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:44,777
I've been apart of this town for... well, look how big my daughter is - for that long.

529
00:25:44,924 --> 00:25:49,718
And opening this inn has been a dream of mine and of Sookie's for most of that time.

530
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:57,085
Along with Michel, we plan to make this community as proud of the historic Dragonfly Inn

531
00:25:57,254 --> 00:26:00,500
as you were when the same team was running the Independence Inn.

532
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:03,040
You mean the place that burned down on your watch?

533
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,331
Can I slap him?

534
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,216
Now, this will also help our local economy because we plan to employ

535
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:11,131
Sorry, we plan to employ...

536
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,338
This call is coming from the house.

537
00:26:16,628 --> 00:26:18,437
- Our house? 
- It's flashing our number.

538
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:20,117
- But we're here. 
- I know.

539
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,559
That's the weird part. Sookie, keep it going in here.

540
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,586
I'll be just a quick... second.

541
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:27,506
Okay, if you have any questions...

542
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:31,119
Yes, about the Dragonfly or deodorant -

543
00:26:31,238 --> 00:26:34,275
the places to buy it, how to apply it, that sort of thing.

544
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:38,913
I responded to the activation of an alarm at your residence,

545
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:41,541
- and I apprehended a prowler in the garage. 
- You did?

546
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:45,002
Yes, ma'am - female, approximately eighteen years old, Korean.

547
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:48,048
Kirk, that's Lane. You know Lane.

548
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:51,305
I thought I knew Lane, but now I think she's in some kind of gang.

549
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:52,368
Lorelai, help.

550
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:56,062
- Their front is some sort of musical group. 
- They are a musical group, Kirk.

551
00:26:56,185 --> 00:26:57,613
- Honey, go sort it out. 
- Got it.

552
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:02,610
Rory's on her way over - brown hair, blue eyes, about 5'6" - don't cuff her.

553
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:03,952
- 10-4. 
- Okay.

554
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:05,262
What...

555
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:08,432
- We failed you. 
- He is a very unpleasant man.

556
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:09,129
What happened?

557
00:27:09,353 --> 00:27:11,484
The second, I mean, the second you walked out the door,

558
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,824
Taylor adjourned the meeting over our objections.

559
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:16,799
- Well, where is he? Where'd he go? 
- He was the first one out the door.

560
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,992
Unbelievable.

561
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:21,503
You can run but you can't hide.

562
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:26,113
Oh, this is cute... The Happy Doughnut.

563
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,429
Hey, we have a little misunderstanding back there, Taylor?

564
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,217
Lorelai, please don't sneak up on me like that. I almost blew my emergency whistle.

565
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:35,729
- We weren't done. 
- Oh, I thought we were.

566
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:37,537
- No, we weren't. 
- Well, what more was there to say?

567
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,010
Nothing was decided. You said to come to the town meeting

568
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,765
and explain what you're doing, then we can start our work.

569
00:27:41,872 --> 00:27:43,497
Oh, well, you can't do that until after the walk-through.

570
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:46,871
Oh, Taylor, I'm in heels. Do you mind? What walk-through?

571
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,797
I and other members of the Historical Preservation Society need to examine

572
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:54,238
the property in person. You didn't think we were gonna make a decision

573
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,158
based on a little chat, did you? I'm sure I mentioned a walk-through.

574
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:59,497
- I don't think you did. 
- Well, I'm mentioning it now.

575
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:01,196
Okay, so, when's the walk-through?

576
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:03,740
Well, I'd have to check with the other society members,

577
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:05,908
set something up in the next month or so.

578
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:08,745
But I have workmen coming Monday, Taylor, the day after tomorrow.

579
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:11,084
Oh, dear. That's cutting it pretty close.

580
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:13,009
Let's do it tomorrow, please - tomorrow.

581
00:28:13,168 --> 00:28:14,637
- Tomorrow's Sunday. 
- Yes, it is.

582
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:17,050
- Well, it would have to be before church. 
- Okay, so midmorning?

583
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,512
- Six? 
- Six? Six in the morning?

584
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,955
Or another day - I could take it up with the society.

585
00:28:22,104 --> 00:28:24,551
No, no, six is fine. Six sharp.

586
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,466
- See you then. 
- Bright and early.

587
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:29,675
- Goodnight. 
- Goodnight. Thanks.

588
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:33,471
We do or die for Stars Hollow High!

589
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:37,376
We do or die for Stars Hollow High!

590
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:40,813
It's the one we fight and fall for,

591
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:44,238
- it's the one we give our all for. 
- Oh, goody.

592
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:50,540
Stars Hollow High! Whoo!

593
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,424
That is our Stars Hollow High fight song.

594
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:56,261
Could've sworn it was Mozart. What is this, guys?

595
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:57,230
Pit stop!

596
00:28:58,857 --> 00:29:02,744
- Bachelor party, phase one is over. 
- Our boy Dean here is tying the knot.

597
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,263
Look, I was just closing up.

598
00:29:04,414 --> 00:29:05,713
- Luke! 
- Dean!

599
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:08,339
- That's funny. 
- I wasn't even trying.

600
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:11,137
We just need to refuel for phase two, sir. It won't take long.

601
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:14,008
You wouldn't turn away a man on his wedding day, would you?

602
00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:16,665
- It's not your wedding day yet. 
- That's what I keep telling him, dude.

603
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:19,994
- It's your last day of freedom. 
- Hey, we should get strippers, right?

604
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:21,176
And cake.

605
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:24,653
Hey, my name's Luke, too. We should start a club or something.

606
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:27,735
Yeah, that would be swell. Look, guys, why don't you go sit down over there?

607
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:31,002
- I'll make some coffee. 
- Tomorrow is the big day, man - big day.

608
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,245
- You're tipping there, Dean. Watch him. 
- I got him, sir.

609
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:38,668
- We really appreciate this, sir. 
- Stop calling me that.

610
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:42,338
- He's a good guy, really. 
- So, what was phase one?

611
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:46,200
A case of beer in the JC Penney parking lot, then batting cages and laser tag.

612
00:29:46,673 --> 00:29:49,522
I've decided that I really like beer.

613
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,543
- I'm the designated driver. 
- Good man.

614
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:56,055
- I'm in the Navy now, you know. 
- Uniform tipped me off.

615
00:29:56,256 --> 00:29:59,307
My older cousins did two-year stints. It paid for their college and stuff,

616
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:02,620
so I joined up. Of course, we weren't fighting international skirmishes

617
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,278
on two or three dangerous fronts like we are now.

618
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:10,061
Hey, what are you doing?

619
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:11,781
- Sugar football. 
- Don't.

620
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:14,408
Come on, guys, respect the establishment.

621
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,866
- They're still kids. 
- I got a better idea, guys.

622
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:21,980
How about I whip up some pancakes real fast, help soak up whatever it is you drank?

623
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:24,239
Sounds good. We'll be needing energy for phase two.

624
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,177
Strippers, right? We gotta get strippers.

625
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:30,802
- Hey, how much do you give a stripper? 
- Well, that depends on what she does.

626
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:34,561
Are they really prostitutes? 'Cause I'd feel bad if they were prostitutes.

627
00:30:34,688 --> 00:30:36,870
Look, guys, I gotta go in the back for a couple seconds.

628
00:30:37,142 --> 00:30:39,543
Don't drink anymore. Don't play jets.

629
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:43,148
Don't jump on the furniture. Just sit still, okay?

630
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:45,154
- And do what? 
- I don't know.

631
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:47,679
Make up a dirty version of the fight song or something.

632
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:51,012
- Great idea! 
- Rory.

633
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:55,084
- What did he say? 
- Oh, he is so toasted.

634
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:56,159
Rory.

635
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,574
- Did he say what I think he said? 
- Hey guys, you know what I think?

636
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:03,009
I think it's real late and that maybe you ought to cancel phase two.

637
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,442
- No way. 
- Hear him out, fellas.

638
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,695
I mean, think about it, guys - how you gonna beat laser tag?

639
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:11,084
- I don't know. 
- Aw, is Dean sick?

640
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:12,548
He just needs his rest.

641
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:15,396
Kyle, why don't you march your friends out of here?

642
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,510
I'll take care of the groom, and he'll see you all tomorrow.

643
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:21,867
- He's right, guys. Let's saddle up. 
- Aren't we getting pancakes?

644
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:24,622
- I'm not feeling good. 
- Come on, big guy.

645
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:26,290
- What? 
- Try to walk.

646
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:31,775
Here we are.

647
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,931
She's smart, man. You know, she's so smart.

648
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:38,612
- I know, I know. 
- She could probably fix the world, you know?

649
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,561
Right, right. She could team up with Kyle - her brains, his brawn.

650
00:31:41,677 --> 00:31:43,905
- No, not Kyle - Rory. 
- Almost there.

651
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:45,768
She's the one, you know?

652
00:31:46,977 --> 00:31:49,814
Come on, Dean, just slide down there, stop talking.

653
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,707
And the hair - pretty hair. She has the prettiest hair.

654
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:55,610
- And that head. What is that? 
- Just your shoes.

655
00:31:58,103 --> 00:31:58,897
I miss her.

656
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,608
Why didn't she love me?

657
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:16,609
Scrubbing shower grout with a toothbrush.

658
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,491
Sure, sure. Flossing with that really, really fine floss

659
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:21,058
that cuts between your teeth like a razor.

660
00:32:21,901 --> 00:32:24,125
- Staring into the sun. 
- 'Til you're blind.

661
00:32:24,284 --> 00:32:26,808
- Absolutely. 
- I feel very ugly this morning.

662
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,863
Join the crowd.

663
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:30,695
That unpleasant man and his cohorts in there?

664
00:32:30,838 --> 00:32:32,298
And have been for about thirty frickin' minutes.

665
00:32:32,547 --> 00:32:34,883
Watching a foreign movie without subtitles.

666
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:37,735
- Getting brain freeze from eating ice cream. 
- What are you doing?

667
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:39,983
We're listing all the things we'd rather be doing than this.

668
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:44,232
- What a mug. 
- It's like he sucked a lemon.

669
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:46,281
I've really grown to hate him.

670
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:52,774
- Nice, huh? 
- Oh, so much potential.

671
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:55,379
It needs a lot of TLC.

672
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:56,798
And we've got an abundance of it, Taylor.

673
00:32:57,565 --> 00:32:59,394
Patty, please, please, help, help.

674
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,708
He's killing me here, and you've got pull with him.

675
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:06,229
Oh, honey, I got my own remodeling to do on my studio that Taylor has to approve.

676
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:07,944
I'm saving my pull for me.

677
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:10,909
Can't I have just a little teeny, tiny bit of your pull, please?

678
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:12,881
Oh, he's gonna see us talking.

679
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:16,419
Lorelai, consultation, please.

680
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,095
- This porch is falling apart. 
- I know.

681
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:22,385
- It's got live termites. 
- Big, fat ones.

682
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,421
- It's a safety hazard. 
- It's the first thing to go.

683
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:26,425
To go? This porch can't go.

684
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:29,112
I'm sorry, Taylor. You just said it's falling apart.

685
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:32,200
I didn't tell you to tear it down. It's historical. It has to stay.

686
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,062
No, no, the porch is not historical, Taylor. It was added in 1980.

687
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,099
- So? 
- So it's a 23-year-old porch.

688
00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:40,377
Unless you think Kate Hudson is historical, it's not historical.

689
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:44,592
Not now, but how do you think we get historical 200-year-old structures

690
00:33:44,698 --> 00:33:46,475
if we tear 'em down when they're just 23?

691
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:47,974
It's rotting away.

692
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:51,637
- Which just means that your guests can't walk on it. 
- So they should hover over it?

693
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:54,832
No, you could build a bridge over it, using appropriate materials, of course.

694
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:55,467
A bridge?

695
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:59,060
Or you could build a transparent Lucite porch over this porch,

696
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,042
so people could walk on the Lucite porch

697
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:02,763
and see the old porch underneath the new porch.

698
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:06,844
Build a clear plastic porch over the rotting wood porch?

699
00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:09,374
With the proper permits, of course, and those are hard to come by.

700
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:12,399
- That's it! 
- Lorelai, watch it. I've got church later.

701
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:14,622
What did I do to make you torture me like this, Taylor?

702
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,373
- I don't know what you're talking about. 
- The hoops!

703
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,809
- The hoops with the jumping and the fire and the hoops! 
- It's just business, Lorelai.

704
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:22,476
I pay to shop in your store. I eat your banana splits.

705
00:34:22,573 --> 00:34:23,766
I've never physically hurt you...

706
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,553
except for that one spit wad in the one town meeting,

707
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:28,896
but I didn't mean for it to hit your eye and I apologized profusely,

708
00:34:28,974 --> 00:34:31,632
so please, please, put me out of my misery and tell me what I need to do

709
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:34,038
- to make this thing happen! 
- I want an ice-cream truck.

710
00:34:34,226 --> 00:34:36,700
- What? 
- I want to sell ice cream off a truck in the summer.

711
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,385
I want to park it in front of the soda shop.

712
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:40,750
I want to ring the bell on it every day at noon,

713
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:44,212
but the only place I can park it is the space that's partly in front of Luke's diner.

714
00:34:44,336 --> 00:34:46,326
- So? 
- You have pull with Luke.

715
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,796
- I guess, maybe. 
- You're friends.

716
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,809
- Yes. 
- You can get him to agree to this.

717
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:51,186
- Use my pull. 
- If you don't mind.

718
00:34:51,318 --> 00:34:53,695
So if I get Luke to agree to this, the madness stops?

719
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:56,056
- If that's what you want to call it. 
- The work begins and the porch goes?

720
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,072
All expedited, nice and neat.

721
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:01,113
- An ice-cream truck? 
- An ice-cream truck.

722
00:35:03,874 --> 00:35:04,632
You can go.

723
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:08,093
Well, this has been a very successful outing.

724
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:11,877
- Back on the bus, everyone. 
- Unbelievable.

725
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:16,081
Yup. Hey, when do you think you'll... Shortcut to Luke's.

726
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:18,231
How is she going to get over Potter's Creek?

727
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,648
Jump it?

728
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,696
- Give him his ice-cream truck. 
- What?

729
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:29,491
I forged a stream and I almost got attacked by a beaver,

730
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,265
- and I'm not leaving here till you agree. 
- To what?

731
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,884
You don't own the street, you own the building.

732
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:37,356
It's a public street. Just let him park his stupid truck.

733
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:39,357
- I'm missing something here. 
- Don't change the subject.

734
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:40,442
I don't even know what the subject is.

735
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:43,335
If you let Taylor park his stupid ringy-dingy ice-cream truck -

736
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:45,723
not even in front of the diner, but in front of part of the diner -

737
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,278
then I can start work on the inn. But if you don't say yes,

738
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,182
then you may not have to see his truck parked outside,

739
00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:53,890
but you will have to see my body swinging from that tree over there

740
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,532
because I will hang myself. I am waiting for your answer.

741
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,350
Sure.

742
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,835
Sure what?

743
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:04,483
- He can park it there. What do I care? 
- Oh, don't kid around here.

744
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:06,516
Your life's at stake. I wouldn't kid around.

745
00:36:06,634 --> 00:36:07,745
- That easy? 
- That easy.

746
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,485
- Well, why'd you say no before? 
- When?

747
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:11,773
- When Taylor asked you before? 
- He never asked me before.

748
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:13,797
- He never asked? 
- Not about a truck,

749
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:17,941
about a giant ice cream cone a few months back. I said no to that.

750
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:20,157
Probably why he thought I'd say no to the truck.

751
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:22,321
- He never asked? 
- Nope.

752
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:25,974
But you're fine with this, and he could have asked?

753
00:36:26,045 --> 00:36:26,766
It's a public street.

754
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,851
- And you would have said yes? 
- I'd have said yes.

755
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:31,841
- And I wouldn't have had to go through all this. 
- Probably not.

756
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:35,061
You know what, I've learned something very valuable here today.

757
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:38,148
Come on in. Sit down there. Take a load off.

758
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:40,049
- Very valuable. 
- Good.

759
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:42,618
I've had a business epiphany.

760
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:47,514
It's like I'm Bud Fox, saying, "Thanks for the lesson, Mr. Gekko."

761
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,636
This will pass, folks.

762
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:52,159
The Lorelai you knew is dead. Remember her?

763
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,278
The eager to please, fresh of face?

764
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:58,031
She thought that success in business meant working hard, applying yourself,

765
00:36:58,154 --> 00:37:01,770
and respecting your coworkers, and she preached that to others - oh, little child.

766
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:03,833
You should probably get some rest.

767
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:08,112
It's about scratching backs, my friend, and kissing things - I won't be graphic.

768
00:37:08,231 --> 00:37:11,109
- It is Sunday morning. 
- It's dirty, that's what business is.

769
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:16,209
It's smoke-filled back rooms with exposed pipes and shady players chewing

770
00:37:16,286 --> 00:37:19,874
on fat cigars and twirling their dirty mustaches.

771
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:23,688
And when you go into those rooms, you can't be a milquetoast muppet.

772
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,516
You have to have pointy teeth and jaws that snap.

773
00:37:26,572 --> 00:37:29,613
- The meek shall not inherit the earth! 
- Thanks for the perspective.

774
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:32,736
- Do you have any coffee? 
- I'm not giving you coffee.

775
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:35,070
I don't have time for coffee.

776
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:39,009
I gotta go find Taylor and close this deal. You think he's back at the store?

777
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,000
Or having his dirty mustache cleaned.

778
00:37:41,118 --> 00:37:42,748
- You're good with the truck? 
- I'm good with the truck.

779
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:44,236
Bless you.

780
00:37:47,585 --> 00:37:48,579
I'll be right with you, folks.

781
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:54,268
So, you're up.

782
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:57,570
Yeah, I'm up.

783
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:00,433
It took me a minute or two to figure out where I am, but...

784
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:01,942
Oh, that's right. You've never been here before.

785
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,732
Yeah, it's not that I remembered. I just kinda looked out the window

786
00:38:05,855 --> 00:38:08,256
- and that's how I could tell. 
- Good, smart.

787
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:11,036
Little concoction of mine - it'll help with the hangover.

788
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:18,544
- Guess I had a beer or two too many last night, huh? 
- Yeah, it happens.

789
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:21,835
- Hope the guys didn't bug you too much. 
- No, they were fine.

790
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:22,910
Good.

791
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,056
So, you're all dressed there?

792
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:29,464
Yeah, you know, big day - getting married.

793
00:38:30,237 --> 00:38:30,970
Getting married.

794
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:36,658
I'm due in the church in about an hour.

795
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,672
- Hey, Dean... 
- And I still gotta pick up my tux.

796
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:42,694
Yeah, right.

797
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:49,347
Thanks for everything, Luke.

798
00:38:50,779 --> 00:38:51,564
Yeah, sure.

799
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:53,566
Good luck.

800
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,421
- So, a total strikeout, huh? 
- Total.

801
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:06,305
And, you know, at first, I felt bad for them -

802
00:39:06,448 --> 00:39:10,283
so lacking in talent, yet so clueless. Then I just felt bad for their guitars.

803
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:12,358
Where are all the good young musicians these days?

804
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:13,965
My ears wanted to fly off my head.

805
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:17,113
I'm going to the music store to look at things I can't afford. Want to come?

806
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:18,415
I have to go get ready for this.

807
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:20,416
- Right. Tell me how it goes. 
- I will.

808
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,931
- Hey, Luke. 
- Hey, Rory.

809
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:26,648
- Where's your mom? 
- Around somewhere. Why?

810
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,357
I thought I'd find her at Doose's. Did she go back to the inn, or...

811
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,759
She was going back to the inn, then she was picking up a wedding present

812
00:39:31,855 --> 00:39:34,297
for Dean from us, because she hates it when people send gifts later.

813
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:38,194
And then depending on time, I was either gonna meet her back at home or at the church.

814
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:40,524
- She have her cell on her? 
- I think it's dead.

815
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:43,155
- What's going on? 
- Or a pager or something?

816
00:39:43,324 --> 00:39:45,753
- Is something wrong? 
- Oh, no, I just need to check something with her.

817
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:48,384
- Well, we can stop by after the wedding. 
- Don't go to the wedding.

818
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:51,118
- What? 
- Don't go to Dean's wedding.

819
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:55,491
- Why? 
- I just... don't go. Trust me.

820
00:39:56,638 --> 00:39:58,185
It'd just be better this way.

821
00:39:59,137 --> 00:40:00,970
So, you're not going?

822
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:03,324
- I guess not. 
- Okay, good.

823
00:40:04,191 --> 00:40:07,477
- Good. I'll see you guys later. 
- Yeah, Luke, I'll see you later.

824
00:40:11,804 --> 00:40:14,615
- Lorelai, do you have a minute? 
- Oh, sure, Kirk.

825
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:16,591
We've had a successful disconnection.

826
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:18,476
- No more alarm? 
- No more alarm.

827
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:19,474
Fantastic.

828
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:22,101
The roofer will be out tomorrow. The repair should take about a day.

829
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:23,929
I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.

830
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:26,831
It's all taken care of, and I want to apologize for any inconvenience.

831
00:40:26,985 --> 00:40:28,040
It was no big deal.

832
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:30,980
I have this strong sense of chivalry when it comes to women living alone.

833
00:40:31,093 --> 00:40:32,127
That's very nice.

834
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,416
My family tree dates back to a 12th-century knight.

835
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:37,959
As a kid, I thought that meant we were related to Ted Knight.

836
00:40:38,277 --> 00:40:40,485
I wrote him a lot of letters. He never responded.

837
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:43,223
- That's cute, though. 
- I just want you to feel safe.

838
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:45,700
You really do, don't you, Kirk?

839
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,999
So, I hope you don't mind my watching out for you.

840
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:49,280
Not at all.

841
00:40:52,654 --> 00:40:53,243
Thank you.

842
00:40:53,877 --> 00:40:55,208
- I'll see you around. 
- See ya.

843
00:40:57,611 --> 00:41:00,360
I think I found the perfect wedding present for Dean.

844
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:03,033
It's sweet, not too personal, classy, yet cheap.

845
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:04,701
- We're not going. 
- What?

846
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:08,563
Luke was looking for you and ran into me, and he was all nervous and everything,

847
00:41:08,624 --> 00:41:11,143
- and then he finally just said we shouldn't go. 
- What does that mean?

848
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:12,597
I think it means that we shouldn't go.

849
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:13,991
- Did he give a reason? 
- Not really.

850
00:41:14,236 --> 00:41:16,444
- I'll go talk to him. 
- No, Mom, he seemed really serious,

851
00:41:16,571 --> 00:41:19,322
and I think that if you saw him you'd feel the same way. He was kind of upset.

852
00:41:19,422 --> 00:41:21,122
- About Dean's wedding? 
- Yeah.

853
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,562
So, we're not going?

854
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,435
- I think it's better that we don't. 
- Okay.

855
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,302
- Mystery, though. 
- Kind of.

856
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:30,575
Well, you've got your nothing-to-do weekend back.

857
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:31,834
Yeah, got that back.

858
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:40,529
Mom, Kirk's following us in a little clowny car.

859
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,285
He's watching out for us.

860
00:41:47,392 --> 00:41:48,501
Ready?

861
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:52,361
No, it's gotta look like we're actually demolishing the porch.

862
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:53,909
We're gonna do pretend swings.

863
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,462
Which would have been easier if we had pretend sledgehammers.

864
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,851
Why do they make these so heavy?

865
00:41:57,954 --> 00:42:01,733
Well, even without the swing, this is a good picture of the two of you

866
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:05,649
about to record an important moment for the two of you.

867
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:06,411
Michel...

868
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,355
I would love a copy of this for my mantel, such a nice moment.

869
00:42:10,468 --> 00:42:11,896
You have to be in the picture, too, Michel.

870
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:14,538
Me? I don't know. All right.

871
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,085
That thing have a timer on it?

872
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:19,218
It's set. I framed the shot. Grab your hammer and smile.

873
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:22,930
- One more for safety? 
- Okay.

874
00:42:28,523 --> 00:42:29,064
What?

875
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:34,769
Just sometimes, it hits me.

876
00:42:35,408 --> 00:42:39,505
This place had a long history before us, has a long future after us.

877
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:43,436
I keep thinking it's apart of our lives, but, really, it's the reverse.

878
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,331
For a little while...

879
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,645
I don't know... it's like we're apart of its life.
