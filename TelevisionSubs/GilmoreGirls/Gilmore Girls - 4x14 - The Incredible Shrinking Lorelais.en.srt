1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,569
- Oh, I love them. 
- Ooh, I love them, too.

2
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:04,801
With an unbridled passion. Good one, huh?

3
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:05,938
I love horse humor.

4
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:09,099
These guys are the best I've got 'cause they're so sweet.

5
00:00:09,184 --> 00:00:11,596
Hey, Michel, come on over. Meet our two new employees.

6
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:14,213
You know that I do not care for the animal kingdom.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,531
Do you want me to hold them for you? 'Cause I've got a couple of others interested.

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,282
Oh, yes, definitely hold them.

9
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:20,715
It's Rory, Talk please

10
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,760
Hi, Rory, it's me. How's school? You learning stuff?

11
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:27,396
Listen, we have the horses, Desdemona and Cletus,

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,778
and the first two rides have to be me and you.

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,871
And hopefully, you're over the time that I took you for the pony ride,

14
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,405
and the pony was old and just sort of stopped and laid down,

15
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,913
and you sort of rolled off into the ditch. It's really not likely to happen again.

16
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:40,216
I promise. So, call me, call me.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,144
Hey, Tom, how do you like our new horses?

18
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:46,033
Very fragrant. Follow me.

19
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:49,162
He's very busy. Don't judge him too harshly.

20
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:53,354
Hey, guys, how's National Goof-off day going? That's what I thought.

21
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:57,588
Now, we got downstairs hardware being delivered on Wednesday morning.

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,790
- Yippee. 
- Yeah, it excites me too.

23
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:03,400
So, I think it would be exciting to have one of you here to see that it's the right stuff.

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,434
Otherwise, things would come to a crashing halt.

25
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,198
Oh boy, I got back to back meetings on Wednesday, and one of them is in Hartford.

26
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,452
- Sook? 
- I can be here.

27
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:12,248
Oh no, I can't - Davey has a check up that morning.

28
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,118
Can you move it?

29
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:16,302
- This doctor's really booked. But I can try. 
- That's okay. Michel?

30
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:19,646
I'm at the Tally Rand making the money that keeps me from having to stand

31
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:22,406
at expressway off-ramps selling bags of cherries.

32
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:26,005
Okay. Oh well, I guess I can move some things around. I don't…

33
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:28,053
- What is that? 
- That's your phone.

34
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,105
- Who's phone? Our phone? 
- I installed it this morning.

35
00:01:31,462 --> 00:01:34,162
You wanted your phone up and running, right? To take reservations?

36
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,681
- Oh, my God. 
- Our first reservation.

37
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:38,601
Quick, quick, answer before they hang up.

38
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,120
- Hello? 
- Dragonfly, Dragonfly.

39
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:43,849
- Say Dragonfly Inn. 
- I mean, Dragonfly Iinn, hello.

40
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:47,631
Why, yes! We are taking reservations.

41
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:49,634
Our opening day is May 6th.

42
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,137
May 8th and 9th, okay, great.

43
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,868
Let me just check. Let me check.

44
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,823
Okay. You got it, and you're getting our best room. Let me just get your information here.

45
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:04,443
Yes. Okay. And your number?

46
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:12,260
7873. Okay. Got your name. Got your number. Got you down for the 8th and 9th.

47
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:13,965
Thank you, Mr. Turner. See you then.

48
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,561
- We're up and running. 
- We're up and running!

49
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:19,167
- But you wrote it down on a gum wrapper. 
- So?

50
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:21,610
It's embarrassing. This is an historical document.

51
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:24,483
Who cares what she wrote it down on?

52
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:27,462
- Big Red wrapper. 
- Juicyfruit would have been better?

53
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,903
Well, I'm going to go out and get a value pack

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,088
for when things really start getting busy around here.

55
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:31,934
Mom, it's me, I left you a message at home, too.

56
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,645
I love that you got horses. As far as that pony ride when I was a kid,

57
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,491
you were forgetting one little tidbit there. That pony did not lie down.

58
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,544
He died, okay? He died.

59
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:44,144
And then the owner dragged him away by the back legs.

60
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:46,919
Every time I use glue, I think of him. But I'll watch you ride, how's that?

61
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,092
Call me back, bye.

62
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:50,520
- What are you doing here? 
- I live here.

63
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,820
- But you have game theory class in fifteen minutes. 
- I just thought I would lie down and rest for a while.

64
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:56,391
I knew it. You were up too late last night. I know I should have told you "lights out."

65
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:58,400
- I had to finish my paper. 
- Your brain needs sleep.

66
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:01,231
- It can sleep when I finish my paper. 
- And then there'll be another paper.

67
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:02,762
- Mom... 
- You know what I mean.

68
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:05,136
- You look out for me. 
- It's what I do. Okay, go lay down.

69
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:06,670
- Yes, ma'am. 
- And stay off drugs.

70
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:13,084
- Whoa, what's that smell? 
- It's the smoke from my soldering iron.

71
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:16,227
I love it. I love burning things.

72
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:21,086
I love the hot tip of my soldering iron as it liquefies metal and singes the wires...

73
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,290
Honey, how long you been doing that?

74
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:25,055
- Three hours. 
- Take a break.

75
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,917
Oh, good, you're all here, so we can clear this up.

76
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:30,565
I found this lying around, and it must belong to one of you

77
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:32,771
because who else would have clothing here? I ask you

78
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:35,285
- Anyone? Anyone? 
- Paris.

79
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:38,238
Anyone? You know, maybe I misspoke.

80
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:41,321
It may not be a shirt. Anyone lose a car cover?

81
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:43,825
- Anyone? Anyone? 
- Knock it off.

82
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:46,682
I'm just trying to find a nice way to tell you that your behemoth boyfriend

83
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:49,621
is getting a little too comfortable around here. And I speak for everyone.

84
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:51,105
- Leave me out of this. 
- Me too, please.

85
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,629
I just don't want to walk into our bathroom and find him sitting on the john

86
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,016
- shooting up steroids. 
- He does not take steroids.

87
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:58,330
You mean that unsightly girth is nature given?

88
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:00,322
- He must curse God nightly. 
- Enough!

89
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,503
And the shirt -- stick a pole in it, and Cirque Du Soleil could start selling tickets.

90
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:04,787
He's big, Paris. She got it.

91
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,492
And why does he have his name written on the back?

92
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:10,394
So it's easy to check when he forgets it? Although if he checks it while he's wearing it,

93
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,756
he'd have to look in a mirror, and then he'd probably think his name was Dlobeelk,

94
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:16,306
- and get confused all over again. 
- Bitter little woman.

95
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:19,343
If he's gonna continue being an unwelcome guest in our place,

96
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:22,968
I emphasize the word "our," keep him penned in your room.

97
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:24,760
- Jealousy doesn't become you, Paris. 
- What jealousy?

98
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:27,023
- Break it up, guys. 
- Neither does makeup or a hairstyle.

99
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:27,986
Can it, Blondie.

100
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:31,125
You drove your own boyfriend away, so you hate that anyone else has one.

101
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:31,923
Oh please.

102
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:34,098
Yeah, why don't you go sit all alone in your room

103
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,387
so you can start getting used to how the rest of your life's gonna be.

104
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:37,634
- I'm not alone. 
- Oh, really?

105
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:40,380
Who do you have besides your poster of Noam Chomsky?

106
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:41,675
- Who do I have? 
- Yeah.

107
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,356
That's what I thought. Very sad.

108
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:55,326
I'm gonna grab Barbie's neck and squeeze until her expandable hair falls out

109
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,047
- and she's dead, dead, dead. 
- Are you staying in here,

110
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:58,716
because I was gonna close my eyes for a little while.

111
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:00,661
I should just tell her Asher Fleming's my man

112
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:03,589
so she can compare her circa 1972 Lou Ferrigno with him.

113
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:06,616
- Then tell her. Put this to rest. 
- You know we're keeping it on the down low.

114
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:08,454
It's easier this way. You're the only person that knows.

115
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:10,804
Then you're gonna have to swallow stuff like that and not let it get to you.

116
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:13,319
He smells. That fat tub of hers smells.

117
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:16,461
Hey, did you keep your notes from when you took Major English Poets?

118
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:17,502
I've got them somewhere.

119
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:18,935
- Can I borrow them? 
- Sure.

120
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:22,110
Great, 'cause that means I can skip a class this week. Buys me two hours.

121
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:25,698
I taught Asher that phrase, "on the down low." He called it delightful.

122
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:26,999
It's a delightful phrase.

123
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:30,900
You know, maybe it's not Janet's boyfriend I can't be around.

124
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,784
Maybe I just can't be around boys, because I have a man.

125
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:36,114
Yes, that's it. Resting now.

126
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:40,358
Wait, wait.

127
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:42,528
Hey, I've got nothing cute to say for my message.

128
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,395
Oh, puppies. There, that's cute. Now leave yours.

129
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:47,489
Hello? Pick up, pick up, pick up.

130
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:48,502
Wait, I'm here. Wait.

131
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,020
I'm running as we speak to not be late for my first official day as a full-fledged food-hall card swiper.

132
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:56,823
That's right, I'm no longer a trainee. After one and a half hours of rigorous training,

133
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,931
I am fully independent and in no need of supervision.

134
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,285
Whoops, sorry. Just ran into somebody, and he's down.

135
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:05,949
- Wait, hold it. I'm coming. 
- I assume you're very proud of me. Talk to you later.

136
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,430
Rory, I'm here.

137
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,492
Of course, you had to be in a big hurry.

138
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:17,437
- It's Rory. Talk, please. 
- Hi. Yeah, of course I'm proud.

139
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:19,444
Card swiping -- who knew you had it in you?

140
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,250
Not I. I'm sorry I can't be there to witness this moment.

141
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:26,484
It's certainly as big a moment as, oh, your first baby step and your first fall on your face,

142
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,258
which came back to back. Hopefully, somebody's taking lots of pictures.

143
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:33,140
Call my cell or call me at Jason's. We gotta stop meeting like this, hon. Bye.

144
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:37,434
Hey, Rory, if you're gonna completely ignore me,

145
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:39,750
I might as well go hang out with my ex-girlfriend. Same thing.

146
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:40,752
Oh, sorry, Glenn.

147
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,291
Everyone is going to be sorry one day -- everyone.

148
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:46,734
You really gotta stop watching "Taxi Driver," Glenn.

149
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:53,959
Oh, did you want me to -- well, it works for me.

150
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:58,228
Hello?

151
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,854
- Rory, hi, it's Dean. 
- Dean, hi.

152
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:02,917
- Bad time? 
- No.

153
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:05,761
I just thought you would be my mom, but my mom doesn't speak

154
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:08,463
- in a resonant basso profundo. 
- A what?

155
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:10,342
I'm babbling.

156
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,061
So I wanted to run something by you to see if it was okay.

157
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,559
- Sure. 
- You know the contractor, Tom?

158
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,003
- Grumpy puss? 
- That's him.

159
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:21,417
He's offered me a job working on his crew. It's good pay. It's flexible hours.

160
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:22,317
Excellent.

161
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:25,256
At the inn. Your mom's inn. Is that okay?

162
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:27,678
- The Dragonfly? 
- If it's not okay, I won't do it.

163
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,543
Why wouldn't it be okay?

164
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,940
Well, it would occasionally put you and me around each other,

165
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,542
and I didn't know how awkward that would be.

166
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:35,123
No. Dean, it's fine. It wouldn't be awkward at all.

167
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:37,648
- You're sure? 
- Tom knows quality when he sees it -- take the job.

168
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:40,305
Good, I just didn't know where we stood after my wedding and all.

169
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:42,439
You guys didn't come.

170
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:45,972
- Yeah, I'm so sorry about that. 
- It was short notice.

171
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:48,855
And we got jammed on some things. But you got our gift?

172
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:50,856
Yeah, Lindsay spins a salad in it every night.

173
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,807
That's weird, considering we got you a toaster.

174
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:54,748
- No, you didn't. 
- I'm joshing ya.

175
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:57,835
- So, I guess I'll take the job. 
- Are you still going to school, too?

176
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,943
Part time, but everything's good. I've got a five-year plan.

177
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:01,876
Five years.

178
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:05,459
Cool. I've got about the next two and a half hours planned,

179
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:08,628
and then there's just darkness and possibly some dragons.

180
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,418
Hey, I made the plunge. I got my own cellphone.

181
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,483
I thought you sounded a little cellphone-y.

182
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:17,337
Lindsay and her mom got a good deal on a family plan, so I signed up.

183
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:18,198
It was time.

184
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:21,085
You know, I don't even know your number anymore.

185
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:23,814
- I can give you this one. 
- Actually, I can just save it.

186
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:26,073
- You are officially part of my phone log. 
- Good.

187
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:31,956
- Well, I'll let you go, and I'll see you once in awhile. 
- Inevitability.

188
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:35,160
And you'll have to tell me what that bass thing was that you said.

189
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:36,344
Something to look forward to.

190
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:37,685
- Bye. 
- Bye.

191
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,940
Come on! Step up, step up. Don't be mice.

192
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,738
No, we did pick a tile for the bedroom suite bathroom. I distinctly remember.

193
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:53,205
Make it a semicolon before the clause about interest rates and keep reading.

194
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,530
Eight weeks ago, ten weeks ago?

195
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:58,784
No, it is okay to end a sentence with a preposition now. I read it in Safire's column.

196
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,221
I remember the guy, I don't remember the tile. I do remember the color, white.

197
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:05,768
Safire. He came up with nattering nabobs of negativism for Agnew.

198
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:08,482
No, I meant the tile was white, but the guy was, too.

199
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,416
Agnew was Nixon's vice president. You know we're getting a little off the subject.

200
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:14,345
- Can you just please keep reading? 
- Over 200 shades of white? I did not know that.

201
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:17,636
With sincerely yours, et cetera, forge my signature and get it out tonight.

202
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:21,006
- We'll look at the samples again and that's okay. 
- I'll see you tomorrow, thank you.

203
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:26,377
- Thank you. All right, bye-bye. 
- Okay, I am done. Round two?

204
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:30,355
Well, this is very romantic. I mean, I'm over here arguing about tile,

205
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:32,982
and you're over there arguing about William Safire.

206
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,788
Whatever happened to the cigarette after sex?

207
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:37,261
Oh no. Trust me, William Safire is much hotter.

208
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,292
We're the all-business corporate couple.

209
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:42,054
Brought to you by Marriott.

210
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,363
- I gotta get that. 
- Oh no, no, no.

211
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:46,606
I told Rory to call me here. Hello?

212
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,494
Well, guess who's demanding we all make an appearance at lunch?

213
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:52,315
- Mom! 
- Your grandmother is coming back from Palm Beach.

214
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,856
What are you doing?

215
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:56,395
Your father has to run over to her house to open it up for her,

216
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,241
and then she will be coming over here for the evening to berate me

217
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:02,529
- and tell me that my couch has some sort of smell. 
- Oh, well, that sounds fun.

218
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:06,922
She wants to have lunch -- sorry, a luncheon -- the day after tomorrow.

219
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:09,831
You, me, your father, and apparently she wants to meet Jason.

220
00:11:09,897 --> 00:11:13,031
All we need is that filthy Eminem fellow to make it a perfect afternoon for me.

221
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,712
Well, I'll try to track him down, Mom, but you know, he might be on tour or something.

222
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,642
Just be here and be on time, and get your hair cut.

223
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:21,688
You looked like the bird lady from Mary Poppins the last time I saw you.

224
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,965
- Well, Mom, I've been very busy lately. 
- I don't care how busy you've been, Lorelai.

225
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:28,759
If your hair looks a mess, it will be my fault, and I don't need that responsibility right now.

226
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:30,034
I'll see you at noon.

227
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:33,050
- What are you doing? 
- I'm getting undressed.

228
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:34,637
- You were already undressed. 
- Well, my mother called.

229
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:37,171
- So? 
- So, I can't talk to my mother naked.

230
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,856
- How would she know? 
- She'd know.

231
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:42,379
Is it like a super power? She can hear naked people?

232
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:47,299
Yes, she can. She can hear sin and depravity and all sorts of lustful things.

233
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,241
Boy, do I wish I could get bitten by that radioactive spider.

234
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:55,558
Please, please try to work me in.

235
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:59,801
My hair is long and unmanageable, and I need that scalp-massaging thing

236
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:03,187
that Cindy does after she washes my hair. It makes me think I'm in Tahiti.

237
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:07,277
Hey! They put pipes in the kitchen. We're almost able to run water!

238
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:08,582
Sookie, give me a second here.

239
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:11,087
Is Cindy there -- she's usually able to work me in.

240
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:15,080
I'm not trying to go around you. Cindy and I are old friends.

241
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,676
They are beautiful pipes. The pipes are really big!

242
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,108
- Sookie, the pipes will be there in two minutes? 
- Sure.

243
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:23,498
Look, it won't take long. It's an easy cut. I'm very low maintenance.

244
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:26,093
I might not seem like it now, but I'd be a delight to have in the place,

245
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,626
and I'll even dry my own hair. I'll bring my own blow dryer, even.

246
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,246
Yes? Tomorrow? Yes.

247
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:36,589
Eleven o'clock, I'll be there. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

248
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:39,651
- Hi, Lorelai. 
- Hey, Dean. So you're working here?

249
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:42,590
Yeah, I thought maybe Rory would have told you.

250
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:46,686
- Oh, Rory and I keep missing each other. 
- Well, I'm here, and your hair looks fine to me.

251
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:48,325
Oh, well, you're very kind.

252
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:51,371
Lorelai, can I talk to you and Sookie over here for a minute?

253
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:52,348
- See ya. 
- Bye.

254
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:53,306
Sook?

255
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:58,606
- Tom, I gotta tell ya, these pipes. 
- She's very thrilled about the pipes.

256
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,986
Yeah, they're terrific pipes, and you got that fancy sink coming in tomorrow morning.

257
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:04,151
And you told them they can't install it until I see it, right?

258
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:07,345
- Because I have very specific sink needs. 
- They won't even leave it without your approval.

259
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:09,629
Can you guys give us a little space here?

260
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,250
- You okay, Tom? 
- This is kind of tricky.

261
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,641
- What is? 
- You know I like you two, right?

262
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:16,286
- We know that. 
- Sure.

263
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:19,798
I gotta deal with a lot of jerks in my business, yelling at you when it's not your fault,

264
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,479
bugging you about budget increases you got no control over. You don't do that.

265
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:26,171
You always smell good, too. That's a plus.

266
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:30,668
So maybe the checks are getting lost in the mail. I'm guessing it's something like that.

267
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:32,752
The checks? What checks? Our checks?

268
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:36,330
It's just, in the last few weeks, we've been having some cash flow issues.

269
00:13:36,474 --> 00:13:39,002
- Oh, this is hard. 
- Are we not paying him?

270
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:40,687
I've been wanting to talk to you about that, Tom.

271
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,516
- Are we not paying him? 
- No, no. We're paying him,

272
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:45,628
we're just not paying him the way we should be. It's been an avalanche lately.

273
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:48,111
You got a lot of things happening here. Everything's going at once.

274
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:52,454
I feel very antsy right now, like I just ate some dark chocolate and drank an espresso.

275
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:57,242
Okay. Let me talk to Tom for a second, hon. We'll clear it up, really. Go, go.

276
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,439
Boy, I'm sorry about this, Tom. It's just been a deluge.

277
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:03,712
It's the home stretch -- that's usually when a deluge hits.

278
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:07,615
I was talking to the bank about a line of credit, but they didn't go for it.

279
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:09,736
- Banks suck. 
- I meant to talk to you sooner.

280
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,845
The thing is, if I don't get paid, I can't pay my guys, then they tend to stop showing up.

281
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:16,897
- So, do you have to shut down? 
- I can keep it going awhile longer.

282
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,338
For the jerks, I'd shut down. You guys, nah.

283
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,773
Thank you. Thanks, Tom.

284
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:23,844
Now, hug, no hug?

285
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:28,315
I'm kinda dirty. How about if you whistle at me later in front of the guys when I walk by?

286
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:29,666
- Drive 'em nuts. 
- You got it.

287
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,063
Hey. I should have talked to you sooner.

288
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:36,947
- Are we dead broke? 
- Getting there.

289
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:41,058
Well, we'll start cutting corners. I mean, I don't need that big, fancy stove from France.

290
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,793
- We'll skip that. 
- No way!

291
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,020
It's too expensive, and I don't want it that much.

292
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:46,788
Sookie, you have four pictures in your wallet.

293
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,623
One of Jackson, one of the baby, and two of that stove.

294
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:50,689
You're getting that stove.

295
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,606
- But we could drop the horses. 
- Desi and Cletus, over my dead body.

296
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:57,934
Well, the upkeep is astronomical. Maybe if we drop one of the horses.

297
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,424
And who's making that choice, Sophie?

298
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:02,220
How about Jackson? Would he be willing to put up anything?

299
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:04,745
He just bought a bunch of new farm equipment. He's strapped.

300
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:07,755
Are you suddenly on super-fantastic terms with your parents?

301
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:12,885
If by fantastic, you mean are we as close as that one-armed surfer girl and the shark, then yes.

302
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,912
- Then what about Luke? 
- What about him?

303
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:17,079
- He's offered before. 
- Out of pity.

304
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,966
- We're pretty damn pitiable right now. 
- He's our friend.

305
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:22,828
He's more than that. And he's a hermit, so we know he's got money,

306
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:25,638
and if he didn't want to lend it to you, he'd tell you to your face.

307
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,092
That would be embarrassing.

308
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:29,944
More embarrassing than Tom almost crying because we're not paying him?

309
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:31,256
No, I guess not.

310
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:35,469
I'll put my thinking cap on, you put yours on, and if we come up with someone better, we'll talk.

311
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:38,961
- But we'll keep Luke as a last resort. 
- Last resort.

312
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:43,380
- This is ridiculous, Paris. 
- He can sit in your room.

313
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:45,377
- I'm still getting ready! 
- Then he can sit in the hallway!

314
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:47,650
- What's your problem? 
- I'll tell you my problem, Andre.

315
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:51,080
Last time you sat on our couch, your mesomorphic frame carved a four-foot crater in it.

316
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:53,411
- I felt like I was sitting in a bucket. 
- You're so full of it, Paris.

317
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:56,845
Kids were skateboarding up and down it. Gandalf the Grey is still falling down it.

318
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,806
- It was a big hole. 
- What does mesomorphic mean?

319
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:01,239
- It means you've got a fat ass, pal. 
- Just ignore her and sit, Klee.

320
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:02,976
- Do not sit Klee. 
- It's my place, too.

321
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,858
Yours, not that brobdingnagian twit.

322
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:07,061
So every friend I bring here has to pass your anal standards?

323
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,338
No, he just has to pass through the door without damaging the frame.

324
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:11,540
- Oh, forget it. Just come into my room, Klee. 
- Good!

325
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:14,346
- Got another hot night at the library planned, Paris? 
- He's still in here!

326
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,711
- There's nothing like the bitterness of the lonely. 
- Yeah.

327
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:19,245
- Nice addition, Potsie. 
- Go put on your spinster dress.

328
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:27,253
I'm moving or she is. One of us has gotta go.

329
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:29,993
- I really hate when you guys fight. 
- Calling me a spinster.

330
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:31,939
I should stick a javelin in her brain.

331
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,535
You should tell her about the professor, that would shut her up.

332
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:37,217
What? What did you say?

333
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:40,667
Just that she thinks you're not dating, and you are. You are, aren't you? Asher Fleming?

334
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:48,261
So busy-busy. I know you are, too.

335
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,778
And I think I'm coming down with swipe wrist. It's like carpal tunnel, only swipier.

336
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,287
Call me if you have any suggestions on how to combat this

337
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:57,216
or if you have Jerry Lewis' number, because maybe his next telethon should be for me.

338
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:59,790
- Rory. 
- Oh, geez. Paris, you scared me.

339
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,410
You told. Come here.

340
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:03,584
- I'm working. 
- Swipe 'em yourself, people.

341
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:04,897
What?

342
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:08,803
- You told Lane about me and Asher? 
- What?

343
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:11,301
That was a secret between you and me. You're the only one I told.

344
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:13,798
- I just told Lane. 
- She was blabbing it around our suite.

345
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:16,267
- That doesn't sound like Lane. 
- She said it to me, so she probably told everyone.

346
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,730
- Who else did you blab it to? 
- I didn't blab it. I just told Lane.

347
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:19,493
That's blabbing.

348
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:22,852
Well, I told her before she had any connection to Yale. She wasn't living here.

349
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:24,167
- She shouldn't be living here. 
- What?

350
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,740
- She knows too much. 
- What are you going to do, kill her?

351
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:26,889
- You didn't tell anyone else? 
- No.

352
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:28,079
Your milk man, your minister?

353
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:31,951
Just Lane, and I can tell her not to bring it up ever again, especially at Yale, especially in our room.

354
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:33,901
- She shouldn't be here, Rory. 
- It's just temporary.

355
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:36,979
That suite is crowded enough with the four of us, plus the Jolly Green Giant

356
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:38,740
and everyone else passing through there. She's gotta go.

357
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,961
- You're just mad about what she said. 
- Janet and Tanna think so, too.

358
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,194
- No they don't. 
- We've talked. It's crowded. Ask them.

359
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:44,499
I will. After my shift.

360
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,310
Look, I know you like having her around, that she brings back memories

361
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,117
of those sunshiny Stars Hollow days when the two of you would hold hands,

362
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,455
and skip through fields of wildflowers, and sing Carpenter songs,

363
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:56,352
but she doesn't belong here, she belongs there. And do me a favor and stop blabbing.

364
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:08,610
Hey, Janet? Could you stop sit-upping for a sec?

365
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:11,447
- I'm done. What's up? 
- Well, Paris...

366
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,462
Don't talk to me about Paris.

367
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:16,131
Yeah, I know, she said some stupid things.

368
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,324
What a tremendous shock.

369
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:20,485
Yeah, and I'm a little mad that she dragged you two into it.

370
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:21,753
What did she drag us into?

371
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,265
Well, she said that you guys weren't happy that Lane is still staying here,

372
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:28,107
which is weird because Lane has been practically invisible.

373
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:31,108
That is, when she's not cleaning the bathroom or picking up out here

374
00:18:31,214 --> 00:18:34,374
or bringing us coffee, et cetera, et cetera. And that's not true

375
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:37,549
that you're tired of her being here, is it? That's just Paris?

376
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:40,328
- Well, it is a little weird. 
- It is?

377
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:43,069
- It's kind of close quarters in here. 
- I know.

378
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:44,839
- She doesn't go here. 
- I know that, too.

379
00:18:44,952 --> 00:18:45,643
It's weird

380
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:49,821
- And you guys have all talked about it? 
- A little -- we thought she'd be gone by now.

381
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:51,348
I'm not good at confrontations.

382
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:55,172
Personally, I'd vote Paris out over Lane in a heartbeat, but Paris goes here.

383
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:55,914
I see.

384
00:18:56,764 --> 00:18:58,397
- Are you mad? 
- No, no.

385
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:00,267
Carry on.

386
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:06,549
- Hey, how was work? 
- Fine, dull.

387
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:08,831
- You gonna study some more? 
- I'm gonna have to.

388
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,654
- You look very serious. 
- Yeah.

389
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,861
- Paris talk to you? 
- Yeah.

390
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:15,713
- She was very mad. 
- Yeah.

391
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,717
I'm out, aren't I?

392
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:23,685
- It's okay. It couldn't last forever. It's time. 
- It's not time. Let me talk to them again.

393
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:27,187
No, it's time. I can't be here forever. I don't even go here.

394
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:29,624
- The janitor's always here. He doesn't go here. 
- He works here.

395
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:31,867
- So get a job here. 
- The jobs here are for the students.

396
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:34,007
- The janitor's not a student. 
- You know what I mean.

397
00:19:34,268 --> 00:19:35,707
- So enroll. 
- Go to Yale?

398
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,802
Or be a janitor. Yale, janitor, in a hundred years, we'll all be dead. It's all the same.

399
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:43,746
No, this hasn't been fair to anyone here. I need to go. I'll go tomorrow morning.

400
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:51,129
We used to talk about living together. Remember, when we were little?

401
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:54,304
- I know. 
- It was going to be a house made of cheese.

402
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:58,625
We had much debate about that. It was down to chocolate, cheese, or Brillo pads.

403
00:19:58,706 --> 00:20:00,797
- Why Brillo pads? 
- I think they just made us laugh.

404
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:03,545
- You brought Stars Hollow here. 
- I'll visit. I promise.

405
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:04,780
Good.

406
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:07,576
Maybe one day we'll live in a house made of cheese.

407
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:09,044
I hope so.

408
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:18,932
Oh, I love shampoo sinks. They're like a hot tub for your head.

409
00:20:18,972 --> 00:20:22,055
Hey, listen, Lee Ann, don't tell Cindy, but you're better, much better. Those hands...

410
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:26,571
- Oh, no. Oh, no, not now. 
- Ignore it.

411
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:31,449
It could be my daughter. We've been missing each other for days. Sorry.

412
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:32,971
Hello?

413
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:36,596
No, this is she.

414
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:39,919
No, no, Sookie's there. Yes, it was all arranged.

415
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:43,487
Everywhere? You've looked everywhere? In the kitchen near the pipes?

416
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:45,028
She loves those pipes. Did you look there?

417
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:49,397
No, no, don't leave, please. I'll get someone down there to sign for it. Just please don't leave.

418
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:52,264
I know. Ten minutes. Okay.

419
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:54,193
Sookie, where are you?

420
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:57,127
Hi, this is Sookie.

421
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:57,895
And Jackson.

422
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:00,491
And Davey. And Davey wants to say hello, too.

423
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:04,418
Go ahead, Davey, say hello. Come on, say hi. Say hi.

424
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,147
- Oh, he's licking the phone. 
- Don't lick the phone.

425
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:09,788
Little peepers. Little peepers, does the phone taste good?

426
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,094
Oh, for God's sake.

427
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:15,350
- I think it tastes like candy. 
- Do you want to say it tastes like candy, huh?

428
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:18,688
Oh he waved! Okay, so here comes the beep.

429
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:21,346
Shorten it, dq'd it, and call me back.

430
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:27,858
- Tally Rand Hotel, may I help you? 
- Michel, good! Listen, emergency, can you...

431
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:29,431
You are not going to believe this.

432
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:34,170
Celine Dion is here. I'm not five feet away from her.

433
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,936
Cool, Spiffy. Listen, is there any way you could...

434
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:40,462
Oh, my heart is pounding through my chest. She's so beautiful.

435
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:41,851
Yeah, she's very pretty. Listen!

436
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:45,932
She's lovelier in person than she is on TV, and so nice.

437
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:48,227
I've only heard good things about her. Listen, can you please...

438
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,364
And I have a pimple today. Of all the days to have a pimple.

439
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,909
Michel, listen. Can you get to the inn? It's really important,

440
00:21:53,991 --> 00:21:56,469
- and Sookie didn't show, and I'm desperate. 
- I can't get away.

441
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:59,638
- I've got wet hair. 
- She sneezed. I should give her my hanky.

442
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:00,908
Forget it. I'll talk to you later.

443
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:05,622
Lee Ann, what can you do for my hair in two minutes?

444
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:07,381
I figured.

445
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:13,293
Coming.

446
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,335
Okay, I'm coming.

447
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,876
You said you were gonna meet the sink guy at the inn.

448
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:22,474
- I did? 
- Yeah, Sookie, you did.

449
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:25,259
You said you were going to meet him to approve the sink and sign for it?

450
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:28,797
- Oh, Tom could have done that. 
- No, Sookie, Tom couldn't have done that

451
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:32,390
because you insisted that you had to approve the sink before it was installed.

452
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:35,058
I did? Oh, I did, didn't I?

453
00:22:35,428 --> 00:22:38,980
Oh, shoot, oh, shoot, oh, shoot, oh, sugar foot.

454
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:42,226
If there was ever a time to use the real word, this would be it.

455
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:45,953
Well, just call them, have them deliver the sink tomorrow.

456
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:47,614
No, no, Sookie, they can't deliver the sink tomorrow.

457
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:50,270
- Why? 
- Because they already sent it back to Canada.

458
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,957
- Why would they do that? 
- Because… that's where it's mother is.

459
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,122
I'm sorry, I got no sleep last night. Davey cried forever,

460
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:59,108
and I finally got him to sleep, and I must have fallen asleep with him.

461
00:22:59,168 --> 00:23:02,687
Sookie, I was counting on you. Now they have to reship it back here,

462
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:05,943
- which means we have to repay the shipping fee. 
- Why didn't you call Michel?

463
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,639
- I did. He couldn't come. 
- You want coffee? I am so tired.

464
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:13,858
This is so typical. He's always complaining about not being included,

465
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,418
and then he finally gets a chance, and he won't come.

466
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,933
Sookie, Michel has a job. We're not paying him.

467
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:21,881
- I know, but still. 
- Sookie, stop, turn, look.

468
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:25,404
- What do you think of my hair? 
- Too much product?

469
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,944
Sookie, for the past six weeks, I have taken every meeting.

470
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,770
I have been at the inn round the clock - I haven't had a second for myself -

471
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:35,297
and all I asked for was just one hour to get my hair done,

472
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:38,107
and then two seconds into the shampoo I get a phone call from a guy

473
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,985
who sounds like a "Kids in the Hall" character telling me I have to get to the inn

474
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:44,195
to okay a sink that I wouldn't know how to okay because I don't know

475
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:45,873
what makes it okay. You know what makes it okay,

476
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:49,084
which is why you said you would be there to say whether or not it was okay.

477
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:51,983
Look, I said I'm sorry I missed the meeting, but I have a baby here.

478
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:54,419
Yes, I know, believe me, that's all I've heard about lately.

479
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:58,026
- Well, excuse me for procreating. 
- We have a business we're trying to launch.

480
00:23:58,106 --> 00:23:59,652
- I missed a meeting. 
- Every meeting.

481
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:02,135
- I said I'm sorry. 
- I don't need you to be sorry. I need you to be there.

482
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,184
What do you want me to do? I have a baby.

483
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:08,019
Sookie, we are drowning here. I wasn't supposed to have to do everything by myself.

484
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:09,586
That's why I have a partner.

485
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:12,858
I didn't know I was gonna be pregnant when we decided to open the inn.

486
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,537
And if you'd known, we wouldn't be partners?

487
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:18,397
No, I mean… Look, this isn't the stuff I'm supposed to help with, anyhow.

488
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:21,147
- What are you talking about? 
- The planning, the decision making...

489
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,655
I've never been any good at that. My part comes later, when we open the inn.

490
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:27,086
- I need you before then. 
- I'm doing the best I can.

491
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:29,903
Fine. I have to go.

492
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,717
What are we gonna do about the sink?

493
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:41,402
- Hey, Luke. 
- Lane, back in town, huh?

494
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,297
- Well, yeah, as of today. 
- You're not staying with Rory anymore, huh?

495
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:48,892
No, it was kind of time for me to move on, considering, you know, I don't actually go to Yale.

496
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:50,274
- Yeah. 
- You need some help?

497
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:52,578
- Nope, I'm good. 
- I've been waiting for ten minutes.

498
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,218
Sorry, not even close to the record.

499
00:24:54,908 --> 00:24:58,560
Listen, I was wondering if I could maybe get my job back.

500
00:24:58,728 --> 00:25:01,805
I know it was wrong for me to take off like that. I totally left you in the lurch,

501
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:04,288
and I'd be willing to work extra overtime hours for nothing

502
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,710
- if you'd consider giving me another chance. 
- Sure.

503
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,238
Really? Oh, my God, thank you, Luke. Should I start right now?

504
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:12,543
- Yes.
- Your shift tonight will be fine.

505
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:14,329
Okay, my shift tonight. I'll be here.

506
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:20,992
- Lorelai. I really, really want to thank you. 
- Aww, you're very, very welcome.

507
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:23,279
- For what? 
- For letting me stay with you.

508
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:24,692
- You're staying with me? 
- Yes?

509
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,295
- And I knew this? 
- Rory told you…

510
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:28,266
Ha, ha, Rory told me, yeah.

511
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:30,955
She did tell you, right? She said she was gonna call.

512
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,482
- I guess you're staying with me. 
- Is that okay?

513
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:37,538
- Yeah, its okay. Just make sure your mom knows. 
- Okay, I will. I'll see you at home.

514
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,093
- Thanks, Luke, I'll see you later. 
- Oh, we'll be here.

515
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,185
- Sit down, Ed. Pigs, gluttons. 
- Customers!

516
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:46,124
- How could people eat this much? 
- Well, this is not all from one person, Luke.

517
00:25:46,222 --> 00:25:48,264
It's disgusting. It's making me sick to my stomach.

518
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:50,917
Well then, have you ever thought that maybe you're in the wrong industry?

519
00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:53,990
I should get rid of the plates, make 'em all strap on a feed bag, you know,

520
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:57,204
hang bells around their necks. Enter them in county fairs.

521
00:25:57,297 --> 00:25:58,879
Come again, soon. See ya!

522
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:02,467
Listen, Luke, could you hit the pause button on the rant for just a sec?

523
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:05,129
- What do you need? 
- I was wondering if we could have dinner tonight.

524
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:08,432
- Dinner? 
- Yeah, I need to discuss something with you,

525
00:26:08,503 --> 00:26:11,121
and I thought maybe we could do it over dinner unless you and Nicole have...

526
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:14,988
- She's in Boston this week. 
- Okay. Well, how about Silvano's, 8:00?

527
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,787
- Why don't you just come here? I could make us some… 
- No, this isn't diner talk. It's more official.

528
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,911
- Are you being drafted? 
- Yes, that's it.

529
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,774
You have to wear a tie at Silvano's.

530
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:25,192
No, just a jacket, and you can take it off the minute we sit down.

531
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,889
- Okay, 8:00. 
- Okay, I'll see you there.

532
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,168
- Love the hat. 
- Livin' on a prayer, baby.

533
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:48,712
Hello, Lane.

534
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:50,366
Hello, Mrs. Kim.

535
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,220
I'm staying at Lorelai's.

536
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:56,936
Wear socks.

537
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:00,095
Okay.

538
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:03,751
...and I'll return your call as soon as possible, thanks.

539
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,910
So I'm on my way to my professor's office to ask him a question

540
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:10,975
about his last lecture because my pen was giving out, and I can't read my own writing,

541
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:14,216
which is not at all true. However, it will give him a perfect opportunity

542
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:17,032
to discuss my paper with me since I'm sure he's graded it by now,

543
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:20,488
and since I'm also sure I'm in for a big helping of "Nicely done, Miss Gilmore,

544
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:21,916
how about an 'A'." Call me.

545
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,571
Come in.

546
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:30,205
Professor Gilbert? Hi, I'm Rory Gilmore. I'm in your Tuesday afternoon Game Theory class.

547
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,936
- I hope I'm not disturbing you. 
- Come in.

548
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:33,191
Thank you.

549
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:37,149
I was wondering if I could go over a couple of things from your lecture the other day.

550
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,981
Okay, well, I wrote something down here, but I cannot for the life of me read my own handwriting.

551
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:46,513
Seriously, if I had this analyzed, Charlize Theron would be playing me in a movie…

552
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:51,393
'Cause I'd be a serial killer, and pretty girls like to get fat and play serial killers

553
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,279
'cause they win an Oscar and - I'm sorry, should I go on?

554
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:58,643
Or you can just wait to let me find your paper so we can talk about why you're really here.

555
00:28:00,527 --> 00:28:01,571
Well, Okay.

556
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:03,746
Rory Gilmore. Yes, here we are.

557
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:08,796
Yes. Right. Okay. Good you came in.

558
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,454
- It is? 
- Yes.

559
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:13,937
Now, in this paper, you were supposed to use a real world example

560
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:17,177
to compare and contrast classical economic theory and game theory, yes?

561
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:20,531
Okay, now your paper dealt well enough with the game theory portion.

562
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,252
However, you then diverged into a discussion on the pollution problem in Mexico City.

563
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,611
Well, it felt to me like someone using knowledge from a different course

564
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:31,539
to pad their paper and thereby avoid doing research for mine.

565
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,073
Oh, no, I just...

566
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:36,336
I've seen this happen before, particularly to freshmen.

567
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:39,075
Usually, it just means that they're overloading themselves,

568
00:28:39,194 --> 00:28:42,307
that they don't fully understand the demands of a Yale academic curriculum.

569
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,076
So, I took the liberty of looking over your schedule,

570
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:49,101
- and I think that's what you've done. 
- Oh, no, no, I'm fine, really.

571
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:52,731
I just have a little trouble with game theory, that's all. I blame my mother.

572
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:54,923
She always made up the games at home when I was growing up.

573
00:28:55,004 --> 00:28:58,634
I begged her for Monopoly, but she insisted on "Mimic Your Favorite Sweat Hog", so…

574
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:01,421
I talked with your advisor. She has the same concern that I do.

575
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:04,891
- What concern is that? 
- You're taking too many courses this semester.

576
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:06,822
- Your workload is too heavy. 
- I'll try harder.

577
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:08,347
I think you should drop this course.

578
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,455
You still have a couple of weeks left before the end of the drop period.

579
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:13,953
You can take the course again when you have more time to devote to it.

580
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:17,788
But, my grandfather took this same workload when he went here.

581
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,852
Different people work at different paces.

582
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:23,573
You shouldn't compare yourself to anyone else. You work at a slower pace.

583
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:25,802
- I don't. I'm not… 
- The choice is ultimately yours.

584
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:29,063
You can stay, but this is a "D" paper.

585
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,311
This is not a big deal.

586
00:29:32,007 --> 00:29:33,989
This happens to a lot of students.

587
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:38,679
Okay. Glad to be fitting in.

588
00:29:44,091 --> 00:29:46,035
- Hi. I'm Lore...
- Get in here right now.

589
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:47,920
- My gran must be here. 
- Jersey, close the door

590
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:49,993
- and get those nuts in the living room.
- Well... Ow.

591
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:53,987
- I've been alone with that woman for over two hours now. 
- Real arm in the coat, Mom.

592
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,595
- Your father's late. You're late. 
- I'm not late, just in pain.

593
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:57,530
Get in the living room.

594
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:00,342
- I can't arrive before the nuts. 
- Don't start with me.

595
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:04,211
Here she is, Mom, Lorelai. The party just gets bigger.

596
00:30:04,356 --> 00:30:06,010
Hi, Gran, how are you doing? You look great.

597
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:08,196
Emily, what is the matter with her hair?

598
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:09,966
Oh, well...

599
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:14,187
I know my granddaughter. If she had received proper notice of my arrival,

600
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:17,037
- she would have done something about it. 
- I told her in plenty of time, Mom.

601
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,307
She really did, Gran. I swear.

602
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,937
I think it is admirable of you to cover for your mother.

603
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:26,909
The importance of family loyalty simply cannot be measured. Sit, dear.

604
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:30,452
Other than your hair, you look well. Are you well?

605
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:33,601
Emily, perhaps the girl would like a drink.

606
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,513
- I am very well. 
- Good. How is Rory?

607
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:40,210
- She's just as healthy as I am. 
- And her hair is perfect.

608
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,579
- And how is she doing at Yale? 
- She's doing great, studying her butt off.

609
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:46,529
Oh, how charming to hear. I'm glad she's doing well.

610
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:50,380
She is a Gilmore, after all. Gilmores have always excelled at Yale.

611
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:54,915
- They have quite a legacy to live up to. 
- Well, your legacy is safe with her.

612
00:30:56,247 --> 00:31:01,352
- Mom, here are the nuts. 
- Oh, thank you, Emily, for that announcement.

613
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:05,657
How wonderful that you don't need some sort of amplification system in order

614
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,127
to make sure that everyone in the area is informed about the arrival of the nuts.

615
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:10,963
I'm sorry.

616
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:14,644
Strange woman, so excited about nuts.

617
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:19,389
- I smell jasmine. 
- You smell impatience. Where have you been?

618
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:20,951
You know very well where I've been.

619
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:24,908
I had some work to get out of the way so I could devote my full attention to you.

620
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:26,988
You look wonderful. Florida agrees with you.

621
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:30,321
Florida agrees with muscle-bound men who dress like women.

622
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:32,815
I am much happier to be back here where I belong.

623
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:36,189
Would you like a nut? They seem to be very important to your wife.

624
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,667
- I thought you liked those nuts, Mom. 
- I'm fine, Trix.

625
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:40,608
I have someone I would like you to meet

626
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:44,979
- Lorelai, have you been there the whole time? 
- Yes, I have.

627
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,822
- Well, I didn't see you. 
- Well, I had my cloaking device activated, so...

628
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:52,797
Trix, this is my partner, Jason Stiles. Jason, this is my mother.

629
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:55,528
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Gilmore. 
- You are very young.

630
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:59,593
- Oh, no, not so young. 
- I think I know if someone is young or not.

631
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:02,955
- For God's sake, Jason, just be young. 
- Cloaking device, never leave home without it.

632
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:08,542
- Richard Gilmore, you're growing a mustache. 
- I know, the Ferrari is arriving on Tuesday.

633
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,564
- I like it. 
- Thank you, Trix.

634
00:32:10,677 --> 00:32:14,730
- It makes you look like Adolphe Menjou. 
- Or Adolphe Menjou's cocaine dealer.

635
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:16,898
What is that?

636
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:20,154
Well, actually, this is a little present that I got for you.

637
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:21,358
- For me? 
- Yes.

638
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:23,527
- Why would you give me a present? 
- Well...

639
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:26,108
- It's not my birthday. It's not Christmas. 
- Yes, but...

640
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:30,056
- You don't even know me. 
- No, but you're Richard's mother, so I thought...

641
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:33,549
What is it? What is this present that you got for an old woman you've never met?

642
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:37,639
- It's a book. 
- What sort of book?

643
00:32:37,803 --> 00:32:39,723
It's a book on French antiques.

644
00:32:41,311 --> 00:32:44,920
- I heard you liked French antiques. 
- I do like French antiques.

645
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,844
You can just open it later.

646
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,775
Absolutely not -- I am company.

647
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:58,361
You don't answer the phone when you have company, so put it away and turn it off.

648
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,728
Yes, Gran.

649
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:03,915
Now, shall we all take turns guessing how long it will be

650
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:08,042
before lunch is served? I will say an hour. Richard?

651
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:09,507
You are bad, Trix.

652
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:13,255
Hi, this is Lorelai Gilmore, and you've reached my cell phone.

653
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:14,765
Leave a message, and I'll return your call.

654
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:24,150
- Hey, you on the phone? 
- No, I'm just checking my messages.

655
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:25,399
Anything important?

656
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:28,779
- No, just a hang up. 
- Good, good.

657
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,180
You know, I should get a globe.

658
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,244
Every time you see a movie, and there's a really important character,

659
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:38,071
and then you go into that character's office, they always have a globe.

660
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:42,685
- You're hiding from my grandmother, aren't you? 
- She is scarier than Nick Nolte's mug shot.

661
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:43,330
Come on.

662
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,583
Please, she's just gonna ask me why I got her a present again.

663
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:51,537
We have decided to just go sit at the table.

664
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:54,993
Perhaps the food will appear by sheer wish fulfillment.

665
00:33:55,265 --> 00:33:57,507
- I'll check on it again, Mom. 
- Oh, please don't.

666
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,517
I wouldn't want to disturb your cook. She's obviously in the middle of a crossword puzzle.

667
00:34:02,714 --> 00:34:06,661
- Lorelai, where did you go? 
- Sorry, Gran. I had to check my messages.

668
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:10,692
- I've got all this construction going on at the inn. 
- Yes, your inn.

669
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:13,590
- Have you seen this inn of hers? 
- No, not yet.

670
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,806
No, it's a mess right now. You'll all see it when it's done.

671
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:17,235
- And when will that be? 
- Soon.

672
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:20,799
- I see you measure time like your mother. 
- Just let me check on lunch, please?

673
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:24,372
So tell me, Lorelai. How much money have you invested in this inn?

674
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,402
Oh, a chunk.

675
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:30,291
And I assume that you have a projected timetable for getting your chunk back out?

676
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:33,015
Well, if everything goes as planned, we're hoping to break even the first year

677
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,292
- and turn a profit the second year. 
- That's optimistic, yes?

678
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,693
Yes, but our town has a pretty regular tourist trade.

679
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:41,903
You know, small inns and bed and breakfasts can be real money factories.

680
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:44,918
Yes, and wonderful places to put all those French antiques.

681
00:34:45,036 --> 00:34:48,478
Well, we have very high hopes, and we booked our first reservation.

682
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:50,516
- When is the reservation? 
- May 8th.

683
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,466
- Really? That soon? 
- You'll be ready by then?

684
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:55,445
Well, we'll have to be. We had to add some extra construction guys,

685
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:58,151
and we'll have to get the sink back from Canada, but we'll finish in time.

686
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,042
- How is the money holding up? 
- Excuse me?

687
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:04,764
The money. I was somewhat aware of your financial situation

688
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,222
before you took this on. How much do you have left?

689
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,922
Plenty. Enough to finish.

690
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:13,743
- You're in trouble. 
- No.

691
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:17,328
You are hemorrhaging money. I see it in your eyes.

692
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:23,284
It must be costing a fortune to get a contractor to stick to a projected completion date.

693
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,123
And you're not working now. Unless your partner is a Rockefeller,

694
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:29,560
you are in serious financial trouble.

695
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,982
Mom, I don't think this is the best time to discuss this.

696
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:35,187
Well, if we were eating, we would have something else to do, but since we're not...

697
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:37,958
- How could you let this happen? 
- How could I let this happen?

698
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:41,249
She is your daughter. It is your responsibility to know

699
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:43,605
when she is in deep financial trouble.

700
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:47,449
- I'm not in deep financial trouble. 
- Trix, Lorelai is a grown woman.

701
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:49,605
Ridiculous. This is a family.

702
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:53,692
It is a family's responsibility to make sure that this doesn't happen.

703
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:55,873
We have a reputation to uphold.

704
00:35:55,944 --> 00:35:59,851
How would it look if a Gilmore goes out into the business world and fails?

705
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:03,212
- I hardly think she's failing, Mom. 
- Well, she looks like she's failing to me.

706
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:07,721
And I am surprised at you. After all, I helped you out

707
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:09,778
- when you had financial problems. 
- Trix!

708
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:13,758
You made that terrible investment in Dubliners Paper Corporation

709
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:17,008
when you were first married. I told you not to, but you wouldn't listen,

710
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,233
- and of course, I had to step in and bail you out. 
- Now, hold on here, Trix.

711
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:24,790
- You would have lost this house if it weren't for me. 
- That is not true.

712
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:27,913
It is not true that you pigheadedly lost that money?

713
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:31,288
I was twenty-seven years old. That is the time to take risks.

714
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,770
Well, when you have my money to bail you out, taking risks is not much of a problem, is it?

715
00:36:34,846 --> 00:36:37,319
- You're making me sound like an incompetent child. 
- Oh, please.

716
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:42,014
I have built two extremely successful businesses, Mother, and both of them without your help.

717
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:44,979
And I do not appreciate you now, many years later,

718
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:48,450
throwing in my face the fact that you once helped me out financially!

719
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:52,101
- Do not raise your voice to me. 
- I will raise my voice if the situation warrants it!

720
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:53,426
Oh, no, not now.

721
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:57,134
- You paid that money back in two months, also. 
- That's right, two months.

722
00:36:57,235 --> 00:37:01,610
How deep in financial ruin could I have been to get that money back to you in two months?

723
00:37:01,712 --> 00:37:04,122
- I'm leaving this table. 
- Let me help you with your chair.

724
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:12,111
- Hey, Tom, is my mom here? 
- I haven't seen her. She could be inside.

725
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:16,498
She sometimes slips in the back door, likes to surprise a bunch of guys with nail guns.

726
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:17,506
Thanks.

727
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,359
Mom?

728
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:25,201
Rory. Hey.

729
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:26,615
Do you know where my mom is?

730
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:31,372
- No, did you check outside? 
- Yeah, I did. She's not there.

731
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:33,717
- She's not at home. She's not anywhere. 
- Are you okay?

732
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:37,641
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just - I can't find her. 
- Well, maybe she's at Sookie's.

733
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:41,116
- Sookie's? Okay, I can try Sookie's.
- Rory, what's wrong?

734
00:37:41,214 --> 00:37:43,677
Nothing. Nothing's wrong. I'm fine, I'm good.

735
00:37:43,753 --> 00:37:46,692
I'm just having some technical difficulties. Get it?

736
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:49,799
- Technical difficulties? Very funny, eh? 
- Yeah, it's very funny.

737
00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:52,994
I know, I am very funny, and I am getting funnier. Yale is doing that to me.

738
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,046
I am just -- it's really developing, the hilarity. Where are we going?

739
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,341
- Outside. 
- Outside?

740
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:59,338
Sure, 'cause I'm used to working a bigger room.

741
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:02,845
- What's wrong? 
- Nothing.

742
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:05,958
- What's wrong? 
- Everything's falling apart.

743
00:38:06,895 --> 00:38:10,739
- I thought I had it all under control, but I don't. 
- What? What was under control?

744
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:15,103
Everybody else can handle the classes, but I can't.

745
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:17,882
And I'm supposed to. I'm supposed to take five classes.

746
00:38:18,118 --> 00:38:21,165
Everybody else does. I mean, my grandfather did.

747
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:25,537
God, how am I gonna tell my grandfather that I failed?

748
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:26,556
You failed?

749
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,142
No, I didn't even get a chance to fail. I mean...

750
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:33,837
- I had to drop a class. I was told to drop a class. 
- That's not a big deal.

751
00:38:34,113 --> 00:38:37,165
It's a really big deal. I'm not supposed to drop a class.

752
00:38:37,242 --> 00:38:40,001
I'm not the drop-a-class person. I get good grades.

753
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:43,104
- I… handle things. 
- Hey, come on.

754
00:38:45,147 --> 00:38:48,402
And Lane, she's not around anymore, and I...

755
00:38:49,591 --> 00:38:54,359
I know she had to go, but I miss her, and I liked her there,

756
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:00,696
and I haven't talked to my mom, and I need to talk to her, and she's not around.

757
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:05,401
And I'm failing. I'm failing everything. I can't do it. I can't handle it.

758
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,161
I'm messing everything up!

759
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,372
- Oh! God, just look at this. 
- Look at what?

760
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:22,518
You having to be nice to me. I mean, you shouldn't have to be nice to me.

761
00:39:22,615 --> 00:39:26,046
I was horrible to you, and now you're married to someone nice

762
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:30,855
- and who's not me and not a failure. 
- You are so not a failure.

763
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:32,145
Yes, I am.

764
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,561
I just can't, I...

765
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:39,841
I need to talk to my mom 'cause I just don't know what to do.

766
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:42,426
It's okay.

767
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:50,018
Luke.

768
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,789
- Hey, I was just coming to meet you. 
- I know.

769
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:53,183
Could we...

770
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:58,404
I need to... I'm sorry, I need to reschedule our dinner.

771
00:39:58,532 --> 00:40:00,837
- Oh sure. 
- Yeah, I'm just very tired.

772
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:03,443
So I'm sorry that I made you get all dressed up.

773
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:05,819
That's okay, it's good for me to do it every once in awhile.

774
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:08,210
- It reminds me why I'm not an accountant. 
- Okay.

775
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,950
- Everything okay? 
- What?

776
00:40:10,192 --> 00:40:11,605
- Are you okay? 
- Why?

777
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:16,059
- Because you don't look okay. 
- Well, geez, take me now, sailor.

778
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:20,370
- I mean, you look distracted. 
- Distracted, no. Well, maybe -- yeah.

779
00:40:20,445 --> 00:40:24,681
- Distracted, okay, sure. I'm very distracted. 
- Anything I can do?

780
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,245
You know, there are very few times in my life when I find myself sitting around thinking,

781
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:36,918
"I wish I was married," but today, I mean -- I'm happy. You know?

782
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:41,275
I like my life. I like my friends. I like my stuff.

783
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:45,411
My time, my space, my TV.

784
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:46,805
Yeah, sure.

785
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:51,873
But every now and then, just for a moment,

786
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:53,911
I wish I had a partner,

787
00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:59,627
someone to pick up the slack. Someone to wait for the cable guy,

788
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,434
make me coffee in the morning, meet the stupid sink

789
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,691
before it gets sent back to Canada.

790
00:41:07,018 --> 00:41:07,740
What happened?

791
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:18,258
I just thought I had everything under control, but I didn't, and the inn is just falling apart.

792
00:41:18,354 --> 00:41:26,157
This has been my dream forever, and I have it, and it's here, and I'm failing.

793
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:31,908
I can't handle it. I just spend every minute running around and working and thinking.

794
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:35,680
And I thought I would have help, but Sookie has Davey, and Michel has Celine,

795
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:37,852
and I'm -- I can't do it all by myself.

796
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:42,137
And I don't even have time to see my kid, and hell, forget see her, just even talk to her.

797
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:45,440
And I miss her. And I sat there in my parents' house

798
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:49,392
just listening to my grandmother basically call me a charity case,

799
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:52,597
and I couldn't even argue with her. I couldn't even say anything,

800
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:55,895
because I am. I'm running out of money, and I don't know what to do about it,

801
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:59,693
and I was gonna, I was gonna ask you for $30,000 at dinner tonight.

802
00:42:00,344 --> 00:42:03,159
- That's how pathetic I am. 
- Thirty thousand dollars.

803
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:06,268
- Well, okay, I mean if you... 
- I don't want to talk about it now.

804
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:07,619
I don't want to think about it.

805
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:11,362
I'm failing.

806
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:17,455
- I'm failing. 
- You are not failing.

807
00:42:17,987 --> 00:42:20,978
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

808
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:26,409
- I don't know what to do. 
- It's okay.

809
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:36,727
Hi, hon. I'm just seeing if I could catch you, but you're out.

810
00:42:36,926 --> 00:42:41,903
So... nothing much to report here. Just give me a call when you can.

811
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,623
Just checking in. Nothing big to report.

812
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:50,828
Okay, give me a call when you can. Bye, mom.
