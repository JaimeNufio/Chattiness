1
00:00:00,658 --> 00:00:02,845
Okay, I got a meeting in half an hour,
so I better run.

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:04,106
Okay, well, have a great day.

3
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:05,647
- Thanks again for breakfast.
- My pleasure.

4
00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:06,966
You make a hell of a frittata.

5
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:08,981
Well, it's ma specialty.
What time will you be home?

6
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:10,118
Around 6:00-ish.

7
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:11,776
All right,
I might make a frittata for dinner.

8
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:12,864
Ooh, sounds good.

9
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:14,876
- Have a great day, honey.
- Bye, hon.

10
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:17,541
- So what'd you think?
- Frittata?

11
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:19,475
- Felt pretty good, huh?
- No, it did.

12
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:21,228
It's homey.
Home-ish. Home-like.

13
00:00:21,237 --> 00:00:22,419
Margaret, what did you think?

14
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:24,228
You seemed like real
people in a real house.

15
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:25,895
Wow. What about the lighting?

16
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:29,252
Well, you can see there's lots of
windows, lots of natural sunlight.

17
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:30,854
- But how do we look?
- Excuse me?

18
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:32,255
In the lighting,
how do we look?

19
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:34,928
Oh, right.
At least 10 years younger.

20
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:36,446
- Than...
- Hmm?

21
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:39,330
Well, if you think we're 60 and
the lighting makes us look 50,

22
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:41,997
then this room is aging us,
and that's not good.

23
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:43,905
- You look 20.
- Very good!

24
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,323
This house was
originally built in 1790

25
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,653
but obviously has been
completely remodeled.

26
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,907
All new appliances.
three fireplaces.

27
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:53,306
Proximity to an excellent
school district.

28
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:56,125
The large backyard.
Great tree-house-building trees.

29
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,015
Ooh, fun.

30
00:00:57,032 --> 00:00:58,645
So I'm gonna make a quick call.

31
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:01,238
Take your time. Look around.
Make yourselves at home.

32
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,500
Well, I don't have to
tell you two that.

33
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:05,897
I'll be right outside, so just
holler if you have any questions.

34
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:07,347
Thank you. We will.

35
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:09,147
- So...
- So?

36
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:11,306
- I told you it was a really cool house.
- It is.

37
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,148
- And that yard?
- Oh, love the yard.

38
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:15,756
And I know it's not Stars Hollow,
but it's a really cool town.

39
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,847
And bigger.
Lots of places to eat and shop.

40
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,292
Three bookstores?
I mean, this is a well-read community.

41
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:21,730
We might be the
dumbest people in town.

42
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:24,165
Yeah, we could be the town dunces.
We'll buy caps.

43
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,961
We'll put "The Dunces"
on our mailbox.

44
00:01:25,974 --> 00:01:26,976
That mailbox!

45
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,078
What is that,
a hollowed-out birch tree or something?

46
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:31,208
The second-floor bedroom --
that's perfect for G.G.

47
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,163
And the third-floor room,
the one with the really cool windows --

48
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:34,208
that could be Rory's room.

49
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:36,337
Honey, I can't imagine
a better house.

50
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:40,815
Big front yard.

51
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,857
Could be our front yard.

52
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:45,082
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:48,632
What's with the face?

54
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:51,202
Face? What face? It's my face.
You don't like my face?

55
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:53,170
- Lor.
- Hmm?

56
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:55,565
You want to stay
in Stars Hollow.

57
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:57,560
Yeah.

58
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:00,794
You want to stay in your house.
You don't want to move at all.

59
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,098
Yeah.

60
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,704
Okay.

61
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:06,385
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

62
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,348
- It's a hell of a mailbox, though.
- Sure is.

63
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:06,843
- You're here.
- I'm here!

64
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,797
You're 37 minutes late,
but you're here.

65
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:09,947
Uh, traffic.

66
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,886
It's sunday morning, Lorelai.
The roads are empty.

67
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,438
Will you let me finish, mom?
Traffic cones everywhere.

68
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:16,729
I mean, you wouldn't believe it. It's
like a crazy obstacle course out there.

69
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,023
It's a miracle I survived.

70
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,405
Maybe we should do
this another day

71
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,342
when I'm less stressed from
the traffic-cone dodging.

72
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:23,281
I have the most exciting news.

73
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:24,536
You're  canceling
my wedding party?

74
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:27,058
I got Randall Farber
as your party planner.

75
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,351
He's canceling my
wedding party?

76
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,817
He spent the last 15 years
as designer-in-residence

77
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:32,140
at the Connecticut Opera House.

78
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:32,784
Boss.

79
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,711
This is a real coup, Lorelai.

80
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:36,773
Your father and I have been
fans of his work for years,

81
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:38,872
and he's only just
begun designing parties.

82
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:42,027
Two months ago, we went to Abigail
Hirschfeld's granddaughter's bar mitzvah,

83
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:44,493
and it was the most
spectacular event.

84
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:48,069
The whole decor was inspired by
Britten's "A Midsummer Night's Dream."

85
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:51,687
I swear I felt like I was in an
enchanted forest the entire night,

86
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,720
except for the children
running around with braces.

87
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,088
Randall, this is my
daughter, Lorelai.

88
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:58,284
Lorelai, Randall Farber.

89
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:00,230
- Hello.
- Ah, the star of our show.

90
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:01,324
Oh, well...

91
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:03,963
I apologize for her tardiness.
It's rather habitual.

92
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,555
Oh, stop.
You're talking to an opera man.

93
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:07,157
I've worked with Renée Fleming.

94
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,132
The personality of a pit bull,
that one,

95
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,482
but all is forgiven when she sings,
am I right?

96
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:14,138
Well, heads-up, I'm not much of
an outside-the-shower singer.

97
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:16,977
I hope you realize how lucky you
are to have Randall, Lorelai.

98
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:19,087
- He's a genius.
- Oh, stop.

99
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,996
Shall we?

100
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,121
Please.

101
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:23,987
The first order of business
is deciding on a theme

102
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,308
around which I can
design the evening.

103
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,120
How about "Man's
inhumanity to man"?

104
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,317
It always worked well for my
term papers in high school.

105
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:31,620
Why don't you show us
what you're thinking?

106
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:34,141
I've done a few mock-up tables.
Just tell me which one

107
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:36,800
- jumps out at you.
- Um, they all jump out at me.

108
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:38,439
- Kind of aggressively.
- Lorelai.

109
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:40,644
Well, I just don't want it
to be a big production, mom.

110
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,539
It's just a party.

111
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:43,828
My dear,
every party's a production.

112
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:45,737
If it's a lousy production,
it's a lousy party

113
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,473
and everyone leaves by 8:30.

114
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:49,180
What about that as a theme?

115
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:51,033
"Everyone leaves by 8:30."

116
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:52,606
Tell me about this one.

117
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:56,220
You've got your stoking plant,
your festive ornament collage,

118
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:58,608
your snowman trio,
your peekaboo Santa.

119
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:01,218
Well, it's lovely, Kirk,
but I already bought my wrapping paper

120
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,232
from the kids from the
Stars Hollow middle school.

121
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,111
- Well, then, you got ripped off.
- What?

122
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:06,386
Those kids are gouging you.

123
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:08,995
I'm selling the same
wrapping paper for 20% less.

124
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,395
Aren't the kids selling
the wrapping paper

125
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:12,427
to help raise money
for a new gymnasium?

126
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:13,848
- Yeah.
- Well, why are you?

127
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,563
To raise money for myself.

128
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:18,250
I'm not a school, Luke.
No one's raising money for me.

129
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:20,829
I saw the opportunity to enter
the market at a lower price point

130
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:22,987
- and I took it.
- Ho, ho, ho.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,940
What, schoolchildren are the only
ones allowed to sell wrapping paper?

132
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:27,055
It's a free country.

133
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:29,596
Hey, Jacob! Beat it.
This is my territory.

134
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,507
Fathead.

135
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:32,367
Yeah, keep walking.

136
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:36,807
- Look who's here.
- Oh, my god!

137
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,304
She's precious.

138
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,958
Oh, those eyes, that skin --
she's gorgeous.

139
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,739
That's what everyone says.

140
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,468
- Hey, Liz.
- Hi, Luke.

141
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:46,702
Oh, she's bigger.

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,129
- 11 pounds, 4 ounces.
- She looks great.

143
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:50,836
I know.
She's really strong, too.

144
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,914
She can practically
hold her head up.

145
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:54,706
Most kids don't do that
until they're two months.

146
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:55,503
- Really?
- Yeah.

147
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,483
- Come on over and sit down.
- Oh, sure.

148
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,529
She's really strong, too.
She takes after T.J.

149
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,227
He's really strong, you know.

150
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,212
We've been watching "Survivor"
sometimes, you know,

151
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,435
and he does the challenges,
you know,

152
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,936
like standing on one leg or
dragging the sandbags around,

153
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:14,171
and he lasts longer than
the guys on the show.

154
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:14,776
Wow.

155
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,828
You know,
baby's first Christmas is approaching.

156
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:20,596
Have you given thought to what baby's
first Christmas gift will be wrapped in?

157
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:21,401
No.

158
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:24,824
I have baby Santa,
cuddly reindeers, Frosty's world --

159
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,796
Kirk.

160
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:27,155
Yeah, okay.

161
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,342
So is April excited
about being a cousin?

162
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:31,828
Yeah. I showed her
the pictures you sent

163
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:34,472
and she's gonna frame the one
of her in the orange jumper.

164
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:36,621
Oh, that is such a good one!

165
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,934
She looks like a
little creamsicle.

166
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,955
- She's very photogenic, huh?
- Yeah.

167
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,613
And how are things with Anna?

168
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:45,820
We're trading calls.
It'll work out.

169
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:48,515
I mean, I've calmed down
a little since the fight.

170
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:50,663
It'll all work itself out.

171
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,652
I'm sure.

172
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:54,107
Actually, I made a list.

173
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,332
I think it's pretty reasonable.

174
00:06:56,594 --> 00:07:00,366
I was thinking I could have April
either Thanksgiving or Christmas --

175
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:01,539
Anna can choose.

176
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:02,831
One month of the summer.

177
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:05,739
And I think I would like
April to come to Stars Hollow

178
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,590
one weekend every other month.

179
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,997
In between,
I can travel to New Mexico.

180
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,312
That sounds fair, right?

181
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:12,568
Very reasonable.

182
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,838
But I definitely think
you need to get a lawyer.

183
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:15,953
No lawyers.

184
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,131
Anna and I are gonna work
this out on our own.

185
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:20,758
That's what you think now,
big brother, but trust me --

186
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,839
custody issues are tough.

187
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:24,621
Well, I don't like lawyers.

188
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:26,089
Well, nobody does.

189
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:29,207
Wait. She's staring at you.
She is!

190
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:33,138
She's staring at you,
and she's falling asleep.

191
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:35,738
Great. I'm gonna
leave her with you,

192
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:37,664
and I'll be back in an hour.

193
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:40,119
- What?
- Oh, I'm going crazy.

194
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:42,430
- I just need a minute to myself.
- Liz...

195
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,398
She's been attached to
my boob for two weeks,

196
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:47,284
and T.J.'s decided to
finally get a "work ethic."

197
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,991
You can't just leave her here.
I can't watch her.

198
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,738
I fed her. She'll be fine.

199
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,060
She'll sleep the whole time.

200
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:53,931
- Wait, Liz --
- I'll be back in an hour,

201
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:55,243
maybe an hour and a half.

202
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:03,944
So why don't we take
our inspiration from

203
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:06,723
the world of "La Bohème,"

204
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,595
fin de siècle Paris?

205
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,248
A little birdie told me you had quite
the romantic parisian adventure.

206
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:13,400
Tweet, tweet.

207
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:16,324
I must confess --
this is my personal favorite.

208
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:18,041
I must admit I
have a soft spot,

209
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:20,976
for it was while I was doing "La
Bohème" at the Staatsoper in Vienna

210
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,860
that I met the incomparable
Franco Zeffirelli,

211
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,116
whose meticulous
attention to detail

212
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,656
has been a yardstick for
which I measure all my work.

213
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:31,257
Your details are simply
astounding, Randall.

214
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:34,027
What about instead of "La Bohème," we
took our inspiration from "Rent" --

215
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:36,014
East Village, 1985,

216
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:38,575
rickety tables,
chipped glassware...

217
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:40,474
- Lorelai.
- Excuse me.

218
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:41,526
Hello?

219
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,919
How goes the party planning?

220
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,029
What? What happened?

221
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,330
- That good, huh?
- Is he okay?

222
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:49,008
I'm not participating in this.

223
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:51,560
Oh, my god. What can I do?
What do you need?

224
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,092
You're not using this phone call
to get out of party-planning hell.

225
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,895
Oh, I'll be right there.

226
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:56,718
Mom!

227
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,609
I can hear Rory on the
other end, Lorelai.

228
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,066
You're not as clever
as you think you are.

229
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:00,861
You rat.

230
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:03,056
- Hi, grandma.
- Hello, Rory.

231
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:05,214
That's my granddaughter, Rory.
Delightful girl.

232
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,113
- She's a senior at Yale.
- Fantastic theater program --

233
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:09,569
Meryl, Jodie.

234
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:12,113
- Uh, I thought we had a deal.
- We had no deal.

235
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,865
No, a deal for life.
You've got my back. I've got yours.

236
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:17,145
I plan on having a good
time at your wedding party.

237
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,461
More importantly,
I plan on making sure

238
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:20,158
that you have a good time
at your wedding party.

239
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,461
Therefore, I think it's important
that you be involved in the planning

240
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:24,801
of your wedding party,
so in the big picture,

241
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:26,630
I do very much have your back.

242
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:27,744
Yeah, whatever.

243
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,785
Okay. Bad news.

244
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:32,319
I'm afraid I have to bail on
you and dad for dinner tonight.

245
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:33,871
Mm-hmm. Logan?

246
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:35,999
Yeah, he's coming to stay
with me for a couple days.

247
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:38,716
He's been so busy with the start-up,
I've hardly gotten to see him lately.

248
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,968
Okay. Can't see you through the phone,
but I'm pouting.

249
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,916
- I'll make it up to you.
- Is he coming to the party?

250
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,887
I'm trying to pat the guest list.
If he's coming, I'm in the double digits.

251
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,739
- He'll be there.
- Awesome.

252
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,505
So okay,
I'll call you later, okay?

253
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,650
The stairs are rickety,
and you think you might fall down them?

254
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:53,483
M om.

255
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:55,989
The pool is empty,
and you've hit your head?

256
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:57,751
- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

257
00:09:57,768 --> 00:10:00,102
Lorelai, come look at
these invitations.

258
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,459
Can we just send an evite?

259
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:05,434
No? Okay.

260
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:11,137
Two hours we spent
picking out invitations.

261
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:12,461
- Two hours.
- Wow.

262
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:15,942
Not counting the one hour we spent
picking out the calligraphy -- for
a party.

263
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,410
This is gonna be some shindig.

264
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:20,489
"Would you like the brown card
with the cream-colored detail

265
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:23,589
and  the parchment insert, or
would you like the cream-colored card

266
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:26,119
with the silk lining and
the clear paper insert?"

267
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,691
How about I'd like some cyanide

268
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,915
and a 30-story building
to jump off of?

269
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:32,219
No, we said one sugar cereal.

270
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,273
You're gonna deny
me the captain?

271
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:34,876
We've got a whole box
of Froot Loops at home.

272
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:37,637
With my fragile state,you're gonna
deny me peanut butter Cap'n Crunch?

273
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,544
- It rips your gums...
- In a delightful, sugary way.

274
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,258
Look, it's got 5% real
peanut-butter-flavored chemicals.

275
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:45,416
- No.
- Oh, fine. Corn flakes.

276
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:46,614
Which one do we get again?

277
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,704
Avoid the words "made
with real vegetables."

278
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:51,244
I cannot take another
day of Emily and Randall,

279
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,992
and I have nine
more days of it.

280
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,566
That's nine more days
than I can take.

281
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:55,694
Oh, you're doing great.

282
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:57,843
I'm not doing great.
I'm going nuts.

283
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,794
Tomorrow we have the food-and-wine
tasting at the Mildred Manor ballroom.

284
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,256
No. Fancy people make
you spit out the wine.

285
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,298
That's what fancy people do.
But not me.

286
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:08,495
I'm gonna drink them
under the ballroom.

287
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:10,893
- What time's the tasting?
- 3:30 till the end of never.

288
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,780
I've got a meeting in Hartford at 2:00,
but I can meet you there afterward.

289
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,431
- Really?
- Yes.

290
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:16,964
Honey, that would be so great.

291
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:19,803
I will never eat peanut butter Cap'n
Crunch again. Yes, I will. That's a lie.

292
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:21,835
But together,
we can defeat them.

293
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,675
This is serious. I don't want to get
the wrong-colored parchment insert.

294
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:26,746
The guys at the gym would
never let me live it down.

295
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,540
- We got everything?
- Yeah, we're good.

296
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:30,182
- Oh, no.
- What?

297
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:31,418
- Bonnie.
- Who?

298
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:33,326
Taylor's niece, Bonnie,
working the register.

299
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,263
She couldn't be slower or
care less about her job.

300
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,402
I thought life in a small town
was supposed to be leisurely.

301
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,530
There's leisurely,
and then there's Bonnie.

302
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:42,273
We're never gonna
get out of here.

303
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,442
Go wait outside.

304
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,785
- Really?
- Go.

305
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:49,449
Honey, buy me Tic Tacs.
Hi, Bonnie.

306
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,770
What's up, Lorelai?

307
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,398
That's cabbage, hon.

308
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,952
I'm gonna need a void here.

309
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:04,006
- Hi.
- Hey.

310
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:06,411
- Who's -- who's this?
- That's Liz's baby.

311
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:09,559
Oh, wow. Congratulations.
You're an uncle again, huh?

312
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:10,440
Yeah, thanks.

313
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:13,001
Oh. Well, she's cute.

314
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:14,861
She looks just like T.J.

315
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:16,638
Hopefully she will
grow out of that.

316
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:18,872
Oh, she's adorable.
She's sweet.

317
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:21,077
- So what's her name?
- Doula.

318
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:22,593
- What?
- Doula.

319
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:24,109
- Oh, is that...
- A weird name.

320
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:27,627
Weird name. A little bit.
But, no, it's special.

321
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,237
It's one-of-a-kind, distinctive.
Can I?

322
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,522
Oh, sure, of course.

323
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,860
Hi. Hi, bubby.

324
00:12:33,876 --> 00:12:36,776
Hi. Oh, precious.

325
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,571
- How old is she? Two weeks?
- 11 days.

326
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:40,592
Oh, wow. And how's Liz?

327
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:41,963
Oh, they're great.
They're both doing great.

328
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:45,186
They're gonna make very strange parents
but, you know, good ones, I know.

329
00:12:45,202 --> 00:12:47,479
Nothing wrong with a strange
but loving household.

330
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:48,850
Yeah, I guess.

331
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,854
Look at her long fingers.

332
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,217
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

333
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,290
What are you gonna be --
a pianist when you grow up?

334
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:56,418
Is that what you're gonna be,
pretty girl?

335
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:59,131
Or a pickpocket.
Well, yes, you might.

336
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,220
You might be a
pickpocketing pianist.

337
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:02,939
Oh, look what she did.

338
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:06,726
- Pretty.
- She's trying to take my finger.

339
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:09,795
Hey.

340
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,998
Hey. Look. It's Liz's new baby.

341
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:14,311
- Cute.
- Yeah.

342
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,237
Well, thanks, um,
for letting me hold her.

343
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:20,018
And tell Liz congratulations
for me, okay?

344
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:20,776
- Will do.
- All right.

345
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:21,763
-  See you.
- See you.

346
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,887
- Want me to --
- I got it.

347
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,923
Okay.

348
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:29,859
We don't have to eat here.

349
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,490
Oh, yes, we do.
You're on my turf now.

350
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:32,794
- Your turf.
- My turf.

351
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:33,906
You know,
I did go to school here.

352
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,097
Yeah, you graduated from Yale.

353
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,726
You can eat from their
cafeteria at least once.

354
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,107
I stopped by for the
occasional bowl of cereal.

355
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,737
Yeah, cereal does
not count, okay?

356
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,836
You need to get something hot,
mushy, and meaty.

357
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,219
You're not making it
sound too appetizing.

358
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,324
Oh, it's not. I have an extra
family pass from parents' weekend.

359
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,301
Oh, so when your parents came to visit,
they got to eat real food?

360
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:50,285
I'm gonna tell them
that you're my brother

361
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,366
and that you're gonna
get your meal comped.

362
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:54,190
I don't mind paying
for my mushy meat.

363
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:57,402
No, that's not the issue.
I mean, I know how to work the system.

364
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:58,325
Oh, you do.

365
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,809
Yeah, you know me --
I can be crafty.

366
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:01,854
Yeah, you can be crafty,
you can make a necklace out of macaroni,

367
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:03,059
but this is
high-stakes deception.

368
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,911
What's my middle name?
Rory "high-stakes deception" Gilmore.

369
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,435
- Card.
- There you go.

370
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,910
And this is my family
pass for my brother here.

371
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:11,109
Logan!

372
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,680
What's up, brother?
What the hell are you doing here?

373
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:14,462
I thought you moved to
London to run the world or something.

374
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:15,402
Just back for a visit.

375
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:16,517
My brother went here, too.

376
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:17,675
Is this your girlfriend, Rory?

377
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:18,906
I don't know. Is it?

378
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,440
I'm a terrible liar.

379
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,078
Apparently so.

380
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:24,350
- Hi. I'm Rory.
- Brandon. Nice to meet you.

381
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,089
You too.

382
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:26,989
So, Dennis,
how much is a lunch pass?

383
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:28,321
$9.75.

384
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:29,406
So you're still with Nicole?

385
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:31,276
Yeah, till I die
or she kills me.

386
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,839
- Well, give her my best.
- Will do, buddy.

387
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:33,953
- Good to see you, Logan.
- You, too.

388
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:36,167
- Nice to meet you, Rory.
- You too. Bye.

389
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:37,961
- Smooth.
- Shut up.

390
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,138
- Man, you worked the system.
- You totally left me hanging there.

391
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,949
What could I do?
You were working the system.

392
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,404
In fact, you were working the system so
well, I think the system needs a day off.

393
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:47,397
I'll have the chicken, and he'll
have the meat loaf with extra gravy.

394
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,153
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

395
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:51,569
Oh, hey, there's Lucy. Lucy!

396
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:52,788
Hi!

397
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:55,434
You must be Rory's
imaginary boyfriend, Logan.

398
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:56,624
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi.

399
00:14:56,637 --> 00:15:00,354
I would give you a proper hug,
but my pockets are full of Apple Jacks.

400
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:02,157
I have art history
in a few minutes,

401
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:05,061
and my professor sounds like
Garrison Keillor on quaaludes,

402
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:07,586
so I need a constant intake
of sugar just to stay awake.

403
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:10,818
I was just treating Logan to his
first branford dining hall meat loaf.

404
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,494
Oh, you're in for a
treat and a stomachache.

405
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:14,482
I can tell.

406
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,367
So, congratulations on buying
the internet or something.

407
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,295
Thank you, although Al Gore
and I are still negotiating.

408
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:20,639
So it's not a done deal yet.

409
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:23,160
It's too bad that you have class.
You could have eaten with us.

410
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,585
Sad. Hey,
why don't we have dinner?

411
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:28,069
I have a lecture tonight,
but what about tomorrow night?

412
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:29,127
- Sure.
- Sounds good.

413
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:30,852
Fun! We'll have to
go to Panchali's.

414
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,704
It's this new indian
restaurant right off campus.

415
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:35,590
It's awesome, and I swear,
no matter how much food you order,

416
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,317
you cannot spend
more than 7 bucks.

417
00:15:37,328 --> 00:15:39,224
Sounds like
stomachache number two.

418
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:42,321
- Hey, babe. Come on.
- Boyfriend!

419
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,409
Boyfriend, this is Rory's
imaginary boyfriend, Logan.

420
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:50,779
I know Marty.
How you doing, man?

421
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:51,413
Hey.

422
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:52,949
How do you two know each other?

423
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:55,249
We met when I was bartending
one of Logan's parties.

424
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:56,486
What a coinkydink.

425
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:57,647
- Yeah.
- More than one.

426
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,334
He did a couple blowouts for me,
and if I'm not mistaken,

427
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:00,899
at the last one,
cops were called.

428
00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:02,038
That sounds familiar.

429
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:05,052
You know, you probably met Marty, too,
and you just didn't even know it.

430
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,918
We should go. I need to stop
by the library before class.

431
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:09,232
Right. Okay, bye, guys.

432
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,264
We will see you tomorrow
for basmati and vindaloo.

433
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:13,319
- Okay. Bye.
- Later.

434
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:16,206
Okay. Come on.

435
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:19,541
- Is this okay?
- Fine.

436
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:22,322
So, what's with that? What's with
the whole "you must have met Marty"?

437
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:23,935
Oh, I meant to tell you.

438
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:25,249
Tell me what?

439
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:27,933
It's kind of embarrassing.
It's so juvenile and lame.

440
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,612
It's like high school --
not even high school.

441
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,483
- It's junior high.
- I'm listening.

442
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:33,468
Well, I've been hanging
out with Lucy and Olivia

443
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,623
and I keep hearing
about Lucy's boyfriend,

444
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:38,251
and they never actually
said his name.

445
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:40,783
And then when I finally met him,
it was Marty.

446
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,294
And before I could even say anything,
he just pretended like we've never met.

447
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,680
And I just didn't know what to do,
so I went along with it,

448
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:50,577
but now Lucy still doesn't
know that we know each other.

449
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,715
It's just kind of
weird and awkward.

450
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:53,858
And did I mention juvenile?

451
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,399
Why did you go along with it?

452
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:58,843
I don't know. It just happened so fast.
I was caught off guard.

453
00:16:58,857 --> 00:17:00,453
So why would he pretend
not to know you?

454
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,509
I don't know.

455
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:05,232
I mean, maybe because he used to like
me, and maybe he still does a little.

456
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:08,135
But that's stupid, because he's
with Lucy now, and she's amazing.

457
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,786
They're great together.
And it's all so annoying.

458
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,758
I mean, they don't call people by name.
They don't call anyone by name.

459
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:15,561
French-fry guy -- I don't know
who that is. That could be you.

460
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:17,352
- So what happened?
- What do you mean?

461
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,838
He must have said or
done something, right?

462
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,180
To make you think
he's still into you.

463
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:21,458
I don't know.

464
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:24,355
He said I was beautiful.
To me, he said it.

465
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:27,048
Can't blame the guy for that.
You are beautiful.

466
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:28,735
- The way he said it.
- Right.

467
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,713
Yeah.

468
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,845
So what?
You guys have been hanging out?

469
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:35,087
No. No, I mean,
just when he's around with Lucy.

470
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,660
So you have been hanging out.

471
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:37,945
Just with Lucy.

472
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,554
So why the secrecy?

473
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,791
I told you,
I was caught off guard.

474
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:43,648
No, with me.
Why did you never mention

475
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:45,185
that you and Marty were
hanging out again?

476
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:46,746
I just didn't
think it mattered.

477
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,655
You're not the
secret-keeping type.

478
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:51,390
Of course, that is before I knew you were
Rory "high-stakes deception" Gilmore.

479
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:54,418
No, it wasn't a secret.
I mean, I didn't tell you.

480
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:57,221
That's it. I swear.
I mean, I didn't not tell you.

481
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:59,272
I just didn't think there
was anything to tell.

482
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,064
Well, you have to tell Lucy.

483
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:02,342
I know.

484
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:04,030
I will.

485
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:07,501
Just, I need to figure out the
right time and way to do it.

486
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:09,283
I just don't want to
screw anything up.

487
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,593
A little brotherly advice --
tell her sooner rather than later.

488
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,446
Yeah, I will.
I'll figure something out.

489
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,546
We don't have to go to dinner with them,
though. I can cancel that.

490
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:18,337
No, it's fine.
We can go to dinner.

491
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:20,238
Unless there's
something on your end.

492
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:21,856
No.

493
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:23,691
Logan, god, no.

494
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,416
Good. Then let's go to dinner.

495
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:27,508
Okay.

496
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:30,881
Really, they charge
10 bucks for this?

497
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,754
Let's make a baby.

498
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:42,840
- What do you mean?
- Seriously.

499
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:45,748
- Christopher.
- What?

500
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,805
- What are you talking about?
- Why not?

501
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,639
What?

502
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:55,972
Why not?

503
00:18:58,298 --> 00:19:02,692
Because we haven't talked
about it at all -- ever.

504
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,871
Okay, well,
let's talk about it.

505
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:07,921
Okay.

506
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,998
You want another kid,
don't you?

507
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:14,453
Oh, god.
Uh, I don't know. I, um...

508
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:18,537
- Sure, maybe.
- Me too.

509
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,122
And, you know, last one
turned out pretty good, so...

510
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,566
Last one didn't turn
out pretty good.

511
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:27,063
Last one came out

512
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:30,660
and a lot of work went into
getting her to pretty good.

513
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:32,560
You're right. You're right.

514
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:34,582
I'm -- I'm sorry.

515
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:35,971
It's okay.

516
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:38,878
No, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

517
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:41,756
But, um, it's different now.

518
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,493
We're adults. We're married.

519
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:45,304
It'd be easier.

520
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:47,443
Yeah.

521
00:19:48,156 --> 00:19:50,590
I guess. I don't know.
I think...

522
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:54,070
I want another kid.

523
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,636
Okay, well,
we're on the same page.

524
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,256
Let's go for it.

525
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:02,116
Honey... Chris... honey...

526
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,195
Seriously -- seriously,
I don't want to go for it right now.

527
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:08,984
Why not?

528
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:11,420
Why not? We just got married.

529
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,299
I mean,
G.G.'s not even back from France.

530
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:16,022
So you don't want
to because of G.G.?

531
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:17,702
No, I mean,
it's not because of G.G.

532
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,780
Because financially, we're good.
We're set.

533
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:21,440
We could have a thousand kids,
feed them,

534
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,465
send them to Harvard undergrad,
law school.

535
00:20:23,477 --> 00:20:24,854
No, I know.

536
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:28,248
Do you not think we'll work?

537
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:30,428
What?

538
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:32,490
Because if that's what you're thinking,
it's a little late.

539
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,617
Oh, my god, no.
That's not what I'm thinking.

540
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:36,344
That's not what I'm
thinking at all.

541
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:37,762
What are you thinking?

542
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,505
I just -- What is this?
What is the rush? Why right now?

543
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,296
Chris.

544
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:52,110
Yeah. No, it's fine.

545
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,746
- Honey...
- No, you're right.

546
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:57,338
We should wait.
We should. You're right.

547
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:15,608
- Cesar, what time you got?
- 10 after 2:00.

548
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,824
All right. Well, as soon as April
gets here, we're gonna have to run,

549
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,275
'cause we're gonna
miss the movie.

550
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:21,010
- I'm feeling you.
- Stop feeling me.

551
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,831
So business has been
going like gangbusters.

552
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:23,897
Congratulations.

553
00:21:23,911 --> 00:21:26,851
Yeah, I'm destroying those
Stars Hollow middle school kids.

554
00:21:26,864 --> 00:21:29,725
Destroying --
outselling them by three or four times.

555
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,489
I think it's safe to say they won't be
getting their new gym anytime soon.

556
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:33,869
You must be very proud.

557
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:34,914
I am.

558
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:37,610
Sure there's been an increase in
prank phone calls, but so what?

559
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:39,000
I can answer the
phone all day long.

560
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:39,776
I'm sure.

561
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,990
And so they've ordered pizzas
to my house day and night.

562
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:44,994
You know what? I love pizza.

563
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:45,943
Bring it on.

564
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,882
They think they're intimidating me,
but I'm not scared.

565
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:49,609
12-year-olds don't scare you.

566
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:50,653
Not at all.

567
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:52,004
Kirk!

568
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:57,144
I thought I told
you to get lost.

569
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,375
We want to talk.

570
00:21:58,386 --> 00:21:59,418
So talk.

571
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:01,376
Not here. Outside.

572
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:03,350
All right. Let's go.

573
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:07,080
But I'm warning you -- if it gets
physical, I will show no mercy.

574
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:11,694
Hello?

575
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:12,990
Hey, Anna, it's Luke.

576
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:13,573
Yeah?

577
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,791
Yeah, I was just wondering
if April took off.

578
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:17,047
She's not here yet,
and she's never late.

579
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:18,121
I'm just getting
a little worried.

580
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:20,296
- April's fine.
- Is she on her way?

581
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:22,024
No, she's not coming.

582
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:23,741
What does that mean?

583
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:26,184
Luke, you can't just come to my house,
threaten me,

584
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:28,565
and then expect me to send
April off to see you.

585
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:30,829
Look, things got a little
heated the other night.

586
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:32,265
Yes, they certainly did,
and frankly,

587
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,454
I'm not comfortable with April
being with you right now.

588
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:35,451
Anna, wait.

589
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:38,183
No, Luke, I won't,
because this is my decision.

590
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:39,210
Goodbye.

591
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:50,210
So we moved away from a literal
theme as per our star's request.

592
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:51,696
- Star -- that's me.
- Yeah, I got it.

593
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:54,325
We did manage to squeeze some favorite
colors out of her, didn't we?

594
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:55,725
Yellow, like my
sunny disposition.

595
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:58,305
Eh, eh, eh. Not yellow.
Buttercup and buttercream.

596
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,540
Do you like buttercream
and buttermilk, honey?

597
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,403
Or would you like
a nondairy color?

598
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,560
Please say you like them.
I've coordinated everything.

599
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:04,183
It's fine.

600
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,888
So of course this area will be
for the tables, as discussed.

601
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:11,128
The orchestra -- excuse me --
band will be over there.

602
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:13,350
And obviously,
the dance floor is right here.

603
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:15,213
Actually, I'm morally
opposed to dancing,

604
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,815
so that's not
gonna work for me.

605
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:18,338
She's just kidding.

606
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,306
I'm so glad you're here. Maybe you can
help keep Lorelai's snarkiness in check.

607
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:24,890
Let's see what
he's got planned.

608
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:28,752
So we still have to
decide on the score.

609
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,672
Have you made a list of
your favorite music?

610
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:33,633
No list necessary. It's going to be
Burt Bacharach. And nothing but.

611
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:34,634
Really?

612
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,542
- We'll make a list.
- Wonderful.

613
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,699
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

614
00:23:38,714 --> 00:23:41,459
Now, for the fish course, I believe
we have either a Pouilly Fuissé

615
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:43,214
or a Muscat,
if you go with the salmon,

616
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,690
and I do think you should
go with the salmon.

617
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:46,823
Agreed.

618
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:48,719
Now, as far as the vows go --

619
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:51,138
I'm sorry. The vows?

620
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:52,242
Wedding vows.

621
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:53,450
What are you talking about?

622
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:55,672
They can be traditional,
or you can write your own,

623
00:23:55,688 --> 00:23:58,387
which seems to be the style, nowadays,
although if you ask me, it's rather garish.

624
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,603
Cecily Pendelem's daughter
actually promised

625
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:02,560
to cook her husband
lasagna once a month.

626
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:05,006
Who wants to hear the word
"lasagna" at a wedding?

627
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,864
Well, you make a good point, but this
is not a wedding. It's just a party.

628
00:24:07,877 --> 00:24:09,511
A party to celebrate
a marriage,

629
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:12,735
which is why a simple exchange
of vows is entirely appropriate.

630
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:15,850
Mom, we agreed to a party, okay?
Just a party.

631
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,196
A wedding is a party.

632
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,814
Yes, but we are
already married.

633
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,715
Yes, and no one
got to witness it.

634
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:22,544
Did it ever occur to you
that your father and I

635
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,050
might like to see our
only child get married?

636
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:27,303
- Christopher?
- I don't think it's such a bad idea.

637
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:29,299
- What?
- Might be kind of nice.

638
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,922
Wait a minute. Is this an ambush?
Are you guys ambushing me?

639
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:35,128
No one is ambushing
you, Lorelai.

640
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:38,322
The idea of your exchanging vows in
front of your family and friends

641
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:39,772
isn't so outrageous.

642
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:43,595
Mom, the whole reason we eloped
is to avoid the wedding thing.

643
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:45,603
No, that's not the reason we eloped.
We eloped because

644
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:47,146
we love each other and we
wanted to get married.

645
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,720
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

646
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,031
- Chris.
- What is the big deal?

647
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:52,361
The big deal is I don't want to
do it and we're already married.

648
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:54,184
- So that's it.
- Well...

649
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,418
I don't even know why I'm here.
It's not like my opinion really matters.

650
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:57,398
Of course it does.

651
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,864
You're gonna do what
you want to do.

652
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,954
House, wedding, kids --
it's all your call, right?

653
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,652
Are you talking about
having more children?

654
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:03,566
Thank you.

655
00:25:03,578 --> 00:25:05,503
- Wait! Are you pregnant?
- No

656
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:06,740
- That's nice.
- What?

657
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:08,444
You don't have to act like it's the
most horrible thing in the world.

658
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,731
Can we not talk about this now?

659
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,820
Why? You don't want to be spur-
of-the-moment? Let's discuss things.

660
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:13,578
Randall, perhaps we should
give them some privacy.

661
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:14,410
Of course.

662
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:17,239
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

663
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:19,764
You're airing all our business in
front of my mother of all people.

664
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:21,314
What is your problem
with a wedding?

665
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:22,458
We're already married.

666
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,986
Exactly, so what's the big deal? You
planned a huge wedding with that diner guy.

667
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,519
"That diner guy"?

668
00:25:27,536 --> 00:25:28,864
Oh, I'm sorry,
should I be more respectful

669
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:30,358
to the guy who punched
me in the face?

670
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:32,383
- Is that what this is about?
- No, this is about us.

671
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,321
At least, that's what I thought,
but apparently it's about you.

672
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:35,903
What is that supposed to mean?

673
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,896
You know what?
I'm going back to work.

674
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,747
No, no. Christopher, hey.

675
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,120
So you want to sue for custody.

676
00:25:48,136 --> 00:25:51,478
No, I don't want to sue her.
I just want...

677
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:55,562
this or something like this.

678
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:58,344
- So you want partial custody.
- Is that what that is?

679
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,332
- Yeah.
- Yeah, fine.

680
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:00,896
Then I want partial custody.

681
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:02,476
Then you have to sue for it.

682
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:04,272
- Really?
- Really.

683
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:06,075
But you're not gonna get this.

684
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:07,032
Why not?

685
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:09,710
From everything you've just told me,
this is a best-case scenario,

686
00:26:09,725 --> 00:26:12,413
and I'm not really in the
best-case-scenario business.

687
00:26:12,426 --> 00:26:13,393
What does that mean?

688
00:26:13,408 --> 00:26:16,711
It means you haven't been in
April's life for the past 12 years.

689
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:19,540
But that wasn't my fault.
I didn't know she existed.

690
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:21,640
- Doesn't matter.
- How can it not matter?

691
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:23,750
Because she has a
history with her mother.

692
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:26,225
This is not about
what you want, Luke.

693
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:28,114
This is not about
what Anna wants.

694
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,395
The court only cares
what's best for April,

695
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,812
and in these types of cases,

696
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:35,430
they almost always
side with the mother.

697
00:26:36,818 --> 00:26:38,326
So what can I do?

698
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:39,545
You can fight.

699
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:40,820
You can make your case.

700
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,265
- Okay.
- Okay.

701
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:45,108
What about Anna's history?

702
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:48,455
- Anna's?
- Any police records? Incidents?

703
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,304
Uh, no.

704
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:52,779
Erratic behavior?
Drugs? Alcohol?

705
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:54,284
I don't think so.

706
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:56,013
So you don't know.

707
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:57,612
We'll look into it.

708
00:26:57,733 --> 00:26:59,195
What about you?

709
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:01,505
Any record?

710
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:02,821
No.

711
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:06,322
Well, yes, actually.

712
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:09,429
I beat up this guy's car this --
this one time.

713
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:10,859
It was no big deal.

714
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:13,169
Did you attend
anger-management classes?

715
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,146
No.

716
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:15,931
Would you be willing to?

717
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:17,773
I don't need to.

718
00:27:17,785 --> 00:27:19,230
You might.

719
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:21,073
Look...

720
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:23,161
I don't want this to get ugly.

721
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:24,973
I just want what's fair.

722
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:26,968
Custody battles get ugly, Luke,

723
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:29,129
and they're not
about what's fair.

724
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:32,399
The truth is this will be long,
it will be expensive,

725
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:33,808
it will be unpleasant,

726
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:35,890
and you'll probably lose.

727
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:39,253
But if you want your daughter,
it's the only way.

728
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:43,024
And time is of the essence here, because
once Anna moves April out of state,

729
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:45,989
it becomes infinitely
more complicated.

730
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:51,193
So I beg and plea with him,
and he says he'll try and come.

731
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,545
but I'm afraid he won't,
and I just can't wait any longer.

732
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,298
So I take the ticket,
and I go running off.

733
00:27:55,314 --> 00:27:56,909
I run all the way
back to the theater.

734
00:27:56,924 --> 00:27:58,475
When I get there,
I burst through the doors.

735
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:01,532
There's sweat pouring off of
me and I'm gasping for breath.

736
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:02,385
And everybody's gone?

737
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,814
No, the director
is still there.

738
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:06,263
- No!
- I know, right.

739
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:07,430
- Can you pass the raita?
- Sure.

740
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:09,463
So I say to him,
"you have to let me audition."

741
00:28:09,477 --> 00:28:11,949
And he says, "you can't audition,
because the auditions are over."

742
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:15,277
And I say, "the auditions can't be over,
because I haven't auditioned yet."

743
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,088
And he says,
"you're two hours too late."

744
00:28:17,105 --> 00:28:19,468
And I say, "that's because
I was in a traffic accident,

745
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:20,645
and I have the
cop to prove it."

746
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,123
Just as I'm about to say,
"and he'll be here any minute,"

747
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,240
and, you know,
not really believing it,

748
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:27,705
officer Frick comes
waltzing through the door.

749
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:29,249
- No!
- Like Fred Astaire.

750
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:31,607
- Officer Frick came through.
- Officer Frick came through.

751
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,776
- So you got the part?
- Oh, no.

752
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,052
I was totally wrong for it.

753
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:38,053
But officer Frick introduced
me to his nephew Drew,

754
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:40,575
and we went out a few times,
so that was cool.

755
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:43,615
Lucy, hands down, that is the best "dedicated
to my craft" story I've ever heard.

756
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,833
Why, thank you.

757
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,657
Hard-working and beautiful --
she's something special.

758
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,163
You got yourself a
good one here, Marty.

759
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:48,988
Thanks.

760
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,011
Oh, Rory's got way better
stories than I do.

761
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:53,676
Did she ever tell you about the time
she drove out to her professor's house

762
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,017
in Albany to replace the
last page of her final?

763
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:58,472
Well, it was in the wrong font,
and I got an "a" on that paper.

764
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,170
Wasn't that the professor
who had a crush on you?

765
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:02,459
Hey! Are you saying that
she didn't deserve the "a"?

766
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:05,061
I'm just saying the woman is the
object of many strange crushes.

767
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:06,326
Oh, that's not true.

768
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,032
The oddball who works
at Baskin-Robbins?

769
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,998
She can't walk within a block
of the place without the guy

770
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,696
running out with a triple scoop
of mint chocolate chip.

771
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:12,836
So not true.

772
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:14,488
Hey, she's something special.

773
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,182
Hey you know, I put four pages
of endnotes on that final.

774
00:29:17,197 --> 00:29:18,256
I deserved that "a."

775
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:21,230
I'm not saying you're not dedicated to your
schoolwork. You're the hardest worker I know.

776
00:29:21,244 --> 00:29:23,933
See, I was always about doing just
enough, or maybe a little less.

777
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,285
Well, look at you now, Mr.
Slaving away.

778
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,846
It's true. My rep is ruined.

779
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:30,118
Boyfriend works insanely hard.

780
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,423
Is that true, Marty?

781
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,642
I just have a couple jobs.

782
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:34,693
Four! The man has four jobs.

783
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:37,917
And a full class load.
It's nuts! Right, Rory?

784
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:39,894
It does seem a bit excessive.

785
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:42,145
- It's not four.
- Four. Rory?

786
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:43,854
I think so.

787
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,373
Finnegan's, the bookstore,
tutoring, and landscaping.

788
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,838
The landscaping is seasonal.
I haven't done that for months.

789
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:52,291
But you will,
and that will be four.

790
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:53,971
That's a lot of jobs, my boy.

791
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:57,789
Hey, I'm just waiting for
that trust fund to kick in.

792
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:00,100
I got it.

793
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,215
- There.
- Thanks.

794
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,408
So how did you two meet?

795
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,509
- Tell him.
- What?

796
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:10,494
- Tell him!
- Why?

797
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:12,403
He stalked me.

798
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,766
That's charming.

799
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:17,113
I was playing Portia in "The
Merchant of Venice" at the rep,

800
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:21,103
and every night,
I see this guy in the front row --

801
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:23,558
same seat, same intense gaze.

802
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,463
And after the fifth show,
I went up to him and I said,

803
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:29,982
"next time I see you, you better bring
flowers or have a knife and stab me."

804
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:30,942
And...

805
00:30:30,957 --> 00:30:34,442
The next time I saw her,
I had daisies and a butter knife.

806
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,709
Sweet.

807
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:40,188
I can't believe I don't even know this.
How did you two meet?

808
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,874
Actually, Marty introduced us.

809
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:45,481
What?

810
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:47,225
I'm sorry.
I can't be a part of this.

811
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:48,619
- A part of what?
- Logan.

812
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,718
They've known each other
since freshman year.

813
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:52,262
I don't understand.

814
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:54,421
Rory and Marty, they used to hang
out all the time at Branford

815
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,898
and watch "Duck Soup."

816
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:59,283
What are you talking about?
W-What is he talking about?

817
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:01,335
- Lucy --
- You guys know each other?

818
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,697
Yes.

819
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:05,142
It was freshman year.
It's no big deal.

820
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,849
You've been keeping
this from me?

821
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,806
Why? I-I don't understand.

822
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:10,801
You guys are friends?
You know each other?

823
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:12,860
- I'm sorry, Lucy.
- We just didn't think --

824
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:14,923
So you both have been
lying to me about this?

825
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:17,063
I don't understand.
Why? For what?

826
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:18,070
I don't know.

827
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:21,127
Oh, my god. This is so messed up.
I have to go.

828
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:22,453
Lucy...

829
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:28,025
What is wrong with you?

830
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,834
I was asked a direct question.
I'm not gonna lie. She's a nice girl.

831
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,671
Yeah, I know she's a nice girl.
She's my friend.

832
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:35,314
You were gonna tell her anyway.

833
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,632
Not here. Not like this.
You totally humiliated her.

834
00:31:38,645 --> 00:31:41,356
Lucy's humiliated because of what
you and Marty did to her, not me.

835
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:43,445
I told her the truth,
which is something she could use more of

836
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:45,161
from her supposed friend
and her boyfriend.

837
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:47,071
I can't believe you're
trying to justify this.

838
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:48,577
What you did was so obnoxious.

839
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:50,218
I was just being honest.

840
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:55,090
I'm just gonna head back
into the city tonight.

841
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:56,978
I've got a lot of
work to do tomorrow.

842
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:58,942
Fine.

843
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:14,431
Hi. 143.

844
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:15,343
What?

845
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,334
I want to talk to you, but I'm
gonna lose count, so remember 143.

846
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:20,261
- 143 what?
- Soaps.

847
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:22,010
- What are you doing?
- Inventory.

848
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,486
- At the inn?
- No, at the Pentagon.

849
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:26,199
I'm tracking soaps and nuclear
missiles for General Abizaid.

850
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:27,416
Isn't it a little late?

851
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,817
The general's a slave driver.

852
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:29,478
Mom.

853
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:32,624
Well, it had to get done at some point,
so I thought I'd do it at this point.

854
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:34,840
- I count better at night.
- Okay.

855
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:36,202
So what's going on?

856
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,920
I thought it was
an all-Logan week.

857
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:40,164
- It was.
- Was?

858
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:42,541
- Boys suck.
- Oh, hon.

859
00:32:42,554 --> 00:32:45,180
- They totally suck.
- Sometimes they do.

860
00:32:45,192 --> 00:32:47,000
Tell me it gets better
when they get older.

861
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:48,853
It gets better when
they get older.

862
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,030
- It does?
- Well, it gets more confusing,

863
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:53,926
more complicated, and more complex.
Does any of that sound better?

864
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:54,769
No.

865
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:57,119
- So what happened?
- It was awful.

866
00:32:57,132 --> 00:32:59,488
We went to dinner
with Lucy and Marty,

867
00:32:59,502 --> 00:33:01,559
and I told him
everything beforehand --

868
00:33:01,573 --> 00:33:04,083
about how Marty pretended that
we didn't know each other

869
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:05,673
and I just had to go with it.

870
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:08,062
Yeah. So right in
the middle of dinner,

871
00:33:08,076 --> 00:33:10,536
he decides that he can't lie to Lucy,
and he tells her

872
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:13,039
that Marty and I have known
each other since freshman year.

873
00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:14,591
- Yikes!
- I know.

874
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:16,626
Who does that, right?
Right in the middle of dinner.

875
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,380
He has no reason to be jealous.

876
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:19,828
I mean,
he knows that I love him.

877
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:20,930
Of course he does.

878
00:33:20,948 --> 00:33:22,121
So why would he do it?

879
00:33:22,136 --> 00:33:24,424
I have no idea.
Mars and venus, you know?

880
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:25,890
Yeah, see,
I don't think that's right.

881
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:27,925
Because mars and venus
are both planets, right?

882
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,505
So they have
something in common.

883
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:32,036
I think it's more like
mars and a bowl of soup.

884
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,611
- Venus and a bowl of soup.
- What?

885
00:33:33,623 --> 00:33:35,645
Venus is the woman.
Venus and the bowl of soup.

886
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:36,766
Really, mom?

887
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,433
Well, I'm just saying.
So how's Lucy?

888
00:33:39,447 --> 00:33:41,914
I don't know.
Not good. She ran out.

889
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:44,775
And I've been trying to call her,
but she won't answer her phone.

890
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,123
I dont blame her. I mean,
I wouldn't want to talk to me right now.

891
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,174
Oh, she'll be fine. She probably just
needs time to cool down, you know.

892
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:53,060
Yeah, I hope so.
I mean, I feel terrible.

893
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,554
Of course you do.

894
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,051
You want to come home?

895
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:58,345
I'm about to start
counting dust ruffles.

896
00:33:58,474 --> 00:33:59,746
No.

897
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:02,650
I should actually probably go
over there and try, you know?

898
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,445
See if she'll talk
to me in person.

899
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:06,140
All right.
Let me know what happens.

900
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:08,270
Yeah, I will. 143.

901
00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:09,487
Ah, thank you.

902
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:10,561
Sorry boys suck.

903
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,623
Yeah, stupid bowls of soup.

904
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,987
Hey. Is Lucy here?

905
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:54,125
She's here.

906
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,546
Can I see her?

907
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:58,952
She doesn't want to see you right now,
and, to be honest, neither do I.

908
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:01,980
Olivia, just let me
explain, please.

909
00:37:01,997 --> 00:37:03,075
No.

910
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:25,007
- Lorelai.
- Oh, my god!

911
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:27,396
Mom, you scared me half to death.
What are you doing here?

912
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,113
I want to talk to you, Lorelai.

913
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,768
Ugh. Is this about the party?

914
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,494
Because I've had
a really long day,

915
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:35,125
and I don't want to
talk about the party.

916
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,443
It's not about the party. I've come
to talk to you about your marriage.

917
00:37:38,678 --> 00:37:40,945
- My marriage?
- Yes, I'm concerned.

918
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:42,240
I don't like what I'm seeing,

919
00:37:42,256 --> 00:37:44,295
and I've come to offer
you some friendly advice.

920
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:46,144
Mom, I really don't
want your advice.

921
00:37:46,158 --> 00:37:48,860
Well, then consider
it unfriendly advice.

922
00:37:48,872 --> 00:37:49,626
Okay.

923
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,226
Christopher is immature,
often foolish,

924
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:54,374
and a little lacking
in common sense.

925
00:37:54,387 --> 00:37:56,493
He doesn't always make
the best choices.

926
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:59,791
Like with me? Are you saying he
chose wrongly in choosing me?

927
00:37:59,808 --> 00:38:03,179
I'm saying he's your husband,
Lorelai, for better or for worse.

928
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,721
I like Christopher.

929
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:06,564
Okay.

930
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,051
I think he's good for you.

931
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:09,518
But it's not going
to be perfect.

932
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:12,067
He's not perfect,
and god knows you're not perfect.

933
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,601
But marriage is not
about always being happy,

934
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:17,024
and often it's about
not being happy at all.

935
00:38:17,186 --> 00:38:20,813
It's about compromise,
which is not your strong suite.

936
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:23,603
Marriage is about swallowing
your pride sometimes,

937
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:25,485
about doing what he wants.

938
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,124
It's not about
winning an argument,

939
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,302
which may make you sad,
because that's what you love.

940
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:32,928
But I don't want to
see you ruin this.

941
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,267
Marriage is serious
business, Lorelai,

942
00:38:35,281 --> 00:38:37,329
and if you don't take
this very seriously,

943
00:38:37,342 --> 00:38:38,577
then this whole thing
could fall apart

944
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,733
faster than you could
possibly imagine.

945
00:38:40,746 --> 00:38:43,264
And he'll be gone,
and you'll be alone again.

946
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:45,576
A ring is no guarantee.

947
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:50,995
Sorry for scaring you.
