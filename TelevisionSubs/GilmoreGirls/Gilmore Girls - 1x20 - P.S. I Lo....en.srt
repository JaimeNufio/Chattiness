1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,193
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:07,445
I really miss you.

3
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:10,031
Do you want to come in?

4
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:11,616
- Rory.
- Yeah?

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,201
- I love you.
- I...

6
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:18,372
So I guess my coming here
was probably a bad idea.

7
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:19,664
Probably.

8
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:20,957
Please, don't be mad.

9
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,877
Why? Because I say I love you
and you wanna think about it?

10
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:26,587
Screw this!

11
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:34,552
So then he starts ripping my $20 bill
into a million pieces.

12
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:37,054
And I'm thinking,
'There's a store full of people.

13
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,598
'Why am I the one
on line with the crazy magician?'

14
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:40,974
I'll cut to the end.

15
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:44,060
He couldn't put it back together
and had to pay me back in quarters.

16
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,187
- Very good story.
- You look tired.

17
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:49,023
- I haven't been sleeping very well lately.
- How come?

18
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:51,901
- I just have a lot on my mind.
- Anything I can do?

19
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,736
- Flag down the coffee.
- Arm going up now.

20
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:58,030
Honey, you gotta wake up.

21
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:00,199
Wanna play?

22
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:02,451
- One, two, three?
- I'll go first.

23
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:03,869
And one.

24
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:06,872
- Pass.
- Why?

25
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:08,999
Because I'm not Anna Nicole Smith. Next.

26
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:11,083
- Two.
- Pass.

27
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:13,586
- Why?
- Because I'm not Mary Kay Letourneau.

28
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:14,753
Okay.

29
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:17,256
- What are you looking for?
- My new husband.

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,300
She's already passed up
two good prospects.

31
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:22,510
- But I'm feeling good about number three.
- Do I want to know?

32
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:24,887
Luke came to the table.
Is he number three?

33
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:26,764
- No.
- You don't know what we're doing.

34
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:30,100
The safest answer in anything
involving both of you is no.

35
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:32,102
We're playing
'One, two, three, he's yours. '

36
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:34,729
- I didn't ask.
- You can take the first guy that walks by.

37
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:38,983
Or if you to pass, assuming there's
a better one, you can take the next guy.

38
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:42,361
If you don't take him, you're automatically
stuck with the third guy.

39
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:43,862
- Got it?
- I'm not playing.

40
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:45,947
Of course not. It's still my turn.

41
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:49,242
Guy number three
is crossing the street right now.

42
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:52,787
- Why am I looking?
- Because it's like a train wreck.

43
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,914
- Oh, no!
- Daddy.

44
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:57,290
- Not Kirk.
- Maybe he'll buy me a pony.

45
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:59,667
I wanna go back to the old guy.

46
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:05,631
- Congratulations, man.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:10,094
- What?
- Nothing.

48
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:13,221
Okay, did someone put
the 'kick me' sign on my back again?

49
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:16,140
It wasn't funny last week
and it's not funny now.

50
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:18,267
I have asthma.

51
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:23,855
- Mom, look, he's leaving.
- No, Kirk, come back, I love you. Drat!

52
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:25,482
All right, your turn.

53
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:28,692
I don't know. You already got Kirk.
How's a girl to top that?

54
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:30,777
You're right. He's yours.

55
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:32,362
And one...

56
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,660
Okay, so, we should order.

57
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,580
Yeah, ordering's good.

58
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:52,266
- Independence Inn. Michel speaking.
- Yes, is Ms. Gilmore there?

59
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,976
I'm sorry, she's busy.
How may I assist you?

60
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,396
Actually, I need to talk to Ms. Gilmore.

61
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,190
- Is this business or personal?
- Personal.

62
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,652
Is anybody there? Hello?

63
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:06,945
Yes, hello? Hi?

64
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,696
- Lorelai?
- Max!

65
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,740
- Is this a bad time?
- No such thing. Where are you?

66
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:14,576
I am in the teachers' lounge.

67
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:16,619
- What are you wearing?
- Nothing.

68
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,705
- You must be very popular.
- And chilly.

69
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:21,833
- We had a chat date tonight.
- I was thinking about something...

70
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,251
- and I wanted to run it by you.
- Okay.

71
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,586
- So...
- Make a gorilla sound.

72
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,713
- Why?
- I wanna play Wild Kingdom.

73
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:30,715
I am not making a gorilla sound.

74
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,676
I'll tell you what color underwear
I'm wearing.

75
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,095
Had you considering the gorilla sound,
didn't I?

76
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:37,930
- Yep.
- I'm good.

77
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:41,266
Okay, I need you to be serious now.

78
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:43,018
Says the man with no pants.

79
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:46,729
We have been having these
very successful phone calls...

80
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:48,981
- for a couple of weeks now.
- Yes, we have.

81
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:51,733
I think that all the talking
has done us a lot of good.

82
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:52,984
Yes, it has.

83
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:57,363
So I was thinking that maybe
this weekend, instead of a phone call...

84
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,074
we should have a date. Let's have dinner.

85
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,077
- In the same restaurant?
- At the same table.

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,745
- Interesting idea.
- I think it's time.

87
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:07,789
You know what? So do I.

88
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:11,125
- Saturday night? 8:00?
- Okay. Wear some pants.

89
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,752
- I make no promises.
- Bye.

90
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,092
- Salt and vinegar.
- Thank you.

91
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,802
Here's your gum, soda, New Yorker,
and dental floss.

92
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:25,346
- They didn't have the minty kind?
- They were out.

93
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,390
Well, this is good, too.

94
00:05:28,474 --> 00:05:30,475
- He wasn't in there.
- What?

95
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,185
Dean. He wasn't in there.

96
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:34,437
- In case you were wondering.
- I wasn't.

97
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,981
I just thought you might be.
So I mentioned it.

98
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:38,816
- Well, I'm not.
- Okay.

99
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:41,276
I thought you'd like to note
for future reference...

100
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,069
that he's not in the store on Wednesdays.

101
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:45,113
You can mark it on that list you're hiding...

102
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:47,615
that says where he is
so you can avoid him at anytime.

103
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,950
- I wasn't avoiding the market.
- My mistake.

104
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,618
- I wasn't.
- Okay.

105
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,537
So, what are you doing tonight?

106
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,748
Well, homework, and then homework...

107
00:05:56,832 --> 00:06:00,001
and if I get all that done in time,
some homework. You?

108
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,794
I have to meet my science partner.

109
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:03,879
- Fun.
- Yes, science is fun.

110
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:06,131
- I'll call you later?
- Okay.

111
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:08,424
- Hey, Lane?
- Yeah?

112
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:11,136
- You sure he wasn't in there?
- I asked.

113
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:22,020
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

114
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,981
- Shopping?
- I had a couple of things to pick up.

115
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:26,357
- At the Cat Club?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,484
- At the Cat Club?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

117
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:33,363
Okay. I just never took you for a cat lover
or a 97-year-old woman.

118
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:34,864
- What'd you buy?
- Nothing.

119
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:36,366
- But you got a bag there.
- I know.

120
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,203
It's got a cat paw stamped on it
and a catnip bow. Wise man.

121
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,831
- Wow, potholders.
- Yes.

122
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,126
Little kitty potholders.

123
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:49,628
- They meow.
- It's a present.

124
00:06:49,711 --> 00:06:52,004
- For someone you hate?
- It's Rachel's birthday.

125
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:55,507
Don't say anything. She doesn't want
anyone to know. She hates birthdays.

126
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:59,177
- Not as much as she'll hate the potholders.
- I don't know how to buy gifts.

127
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:01,721
I don't like to buy gifts.
I don't like getting gifts.

128
00:07:01,763 --> 00:07:05,599
This whole gift-giving-and-getting process
is completely insane.

129
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:07,893
- The rant begins.
- Suddenly, on a certain date...

130
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:09,769
the level of my affection for a person...

131
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:12,814
isn't measured by the way I treat them
or what we share.

132
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:16,192
Just because I didn't buy her furry slippers
or a giant shoetree...

133
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:19,236
- all of a sudden, I suck.
- Luke, stop.

134
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,365
You know, you cannot give her
these potholders.

135
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:23,823
I know.

136
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:27,411
- Go to the mall, walk around a little.
- No malls. I hate malls.

137
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:28,578
Rant number two.

138
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:31,080
They underpay employees
and overprice merchandise.

139
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,916
They contribute to urban sprawl.
They encourage materialism.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,543
The parking's a horror.
You drive in, you pay a buck.

141
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:40,713
- Even if you're only there for five...
- Okay, Emma Goldman, I'll tell you what.

142
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:43,340
- I'll go for you.
- You're gonna shop for me?

143
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:45,592
I have the day off tomorrow.
I was gonna go anyway.

144
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:48,553
- You're serious?
- I'll get a bunch of stuff, all returnable.

145
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,597
I'll bring it, you pick what you want,
and the rest I'll return.

146
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:53,600
I'll do the work.
All you have to do is point.

147
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:56,518
- One finger. Preferably, your index.
- I don't know.

148
00:07:56,603 --> 00:08:00,189
It's the first special occasion you both
have shared since she's been back.

149
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,941
- Don't you wanna give something nice?
- I am taking her out to dinner.

150
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,527
Yeah, I know.
I gotta get her something nice.

151
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,279
So then let me help.

152
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,781
- All right. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

153
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,492
Nothing too 'out there,' okay?
She's not into all that trendy stuff.

154
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:18,954
She likes simple, clean nature.
Elephants, candles, okay?

155
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:22,583
If you can find a candle
shaped like an elephant...

156
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,252
Okay, you know what?
I've got it all under control.

157
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,629
- Okay, thanks.
- Get rid of these.

158
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:35,886
Hello? Lane, are you here?

159
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,012
Jeez!

160
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:40,473
Who are you? Why you call Lane?
How you know Lane? You date her?

161
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:41,682
- You try to?
- No.

162
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,977
Then why are you here?
Empty your pockets.

163
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,562
- Okay, I'm gonna go now.
- Dean, wait.

164
00:08:46,646 --> 00:08:47,938
- Who's Dean?
- I'm Dean.

165
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,981
- How you know him?
- We go to school together.

166
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:52,526
- You do?
- Yeah, we're science partners.

167
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,402
- You don't talk!
- Sorry.

168
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:55,945
Science partners?

169
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:58,489
- Yes, I invited him over to work.
- Work?

170
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,825
- On our science project.
- Reproduction?

171
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,286
Spores, molds, and fungus.

172
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,662
- Science project?
- Yes.

173
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,788
- For school?
- Yes.

174
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:08,289
- You're not dating?
- No.

175
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:09,957
Okay. Follow me.

176
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:19,966
You, sit here! You, sit here!

177
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,759
I'm going over there.

178
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:24,386
When I come back,
these chairs will be in same place.

179
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,847
- No moving. You understand?
- Yes, Mamma.

180
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:29,474
- Not you, him.
- Yes, I understand.

181
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:36,689
I see all.

182
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:44,112
- So that's your mom?
- That's my mom.

183
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:46,656
- Has she seen Patton?
- She gets uptight about boys.

184
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,950
- I sensed that.
- It's nothing personal.

185
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,201
I'm sure once she gets to know me, she'll...

186
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:54,496
No, she'll hate you forever.
It's just nothing personal.

187
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,206
We should probably get started.

188
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,291
- Chapter 12?
- Sounds good.

189
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:08,174
- Is this weird for you?
- A little.

190
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:09,467
Me, too.

191
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:13,471
I didn't know if Rory told you
to hate me or something.

192
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:15,848
- That's not Rory.
- Yeah, I know.

193
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:21,103
- How is she?
- Good.

194
00:10:21,562 --> 00:10:23,897
Goodish. Less 'good' than 'ish. '

195
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:26,482
Yeah? How much less?

196
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,859
- We're breaking our agreement.
- What agreement?

197
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:30,610
Our agreement not to talk about Rory.

198
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:32,988
We didn't have an agreement
not to talk about Rory.

199
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:34,531
It was an unspoken agreement.

200
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:37,200
It was really unspoken
'cause nobody spoke it.

201
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:40,912
If we have to study together, it would
be better if we didn't discuss Rory.

202
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:42,162
Fine.

203
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:47,876
- She can't go in to the market.
- Why not?

204
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:50,044
- Because you're there.
- Not on Wednesdays.

205
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:51,629
Already noted.

206
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,882
Can I ask you a really personal question?

207
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,634
You can ask. I might not answer.

208
00:10:56,717 --> 00:10:59,219
Do you think you and Rory
will ever get back together?

209
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:02,889
I vote we go back
to the 'no talking about Rory' agreement.

210
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:05,224
Look, I'm just saying that I...

211
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,145
I should have called. I'm sorry.

212
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,109
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- It doesn't matter.

213
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:19,820
- I didn't think you'd want to know.
- I got it.

214
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:22,781
Rory, stop.
Okay, that's the opposite of 'stop. '

215
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,992
Forget it. You didn't tell me.
Now I know. Life goes on.

216
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:29,078
- Don't be mad.
- I'm fine. I have to go.

217
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,092
Time to get up.

218
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:47,303
Hey, I have a huge dilemma
that I need your opinion on.

219
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:48,428
What?

220
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:52,390
Am I more beautiful today
than I was yesterday?

221
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:53,558
Oh, boy.

222
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:56,561
I'm not sure. At first
I looked in the mirror and thought:

223
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:59,146
'Well, yes.
Definitely a huge improvement. '

224
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,647
Can I have my pillow back?

225
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:03,817
But then I thought maybe it's not
that I'm more beautiful today.

226
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,070
Maybe I was as beautiful yesterday. Only,
I lacked the self-esteem to recognize it.

227
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:09,530
I'm gonna take a shower.

228
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:12,908
- Hurry up and I'll drive you to school.
- No, thanks.

229
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:15,619
Why so charming this morning?

230
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,996
I had an annoying visit from
the Stars Hollow wake-up fairy.

231
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,290
- Where's my tie?
- In your drawer.

232
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,834
- I'm looking in the drawer.
- Check the living room.

233
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,710
Why would it be in the living room?

234
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:28,504
Because it's been seeing the doily
on the coffee table.

235
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,882
Sorry, I did not want you
to find out this way.

236
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,301
Don't take this personally, but get out.

237
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:35,136
Okay, you're crabby.

238
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,263
Do you know what the perfect cure
for crabbiness is?

239
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:40,932
A fabulous trip to the mall.

240
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:45,061
What do you say? You can blow off school
and come with me.

241
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:47,939
We can shop, go to the movies,
maybe talk a little.

242
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:51,274
- No, thanks.
- Come on, it might make you feel better.

243
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:53,401
I feel fine, and I don't wanna shop.

244
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:57,363
I know you've been in a funk over Dean,
but you have to try not to dwell on it.

245
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:58,989
I'm gonna be late for school.

246
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:01,616
Okay. Then just meet me in town
around 4:00.

247
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:04,161
We'll get some Indian food
and spoil our dinner.

248
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:06,913
- Whatever.
- Hey, love the enthusiasm.

249
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:09,457
Does Up With People know about you?

250
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:13,628
Luke's. Yeah, hang on.

251
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,716
Okay, yeah, cheeseburger, fries, well...

252
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,680
Vanilla shake, coke. Yes, we have salad.

253
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,683
One salad with blue cheese,
one with ranch. Got it. 20 minutes.

254
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,059
What the hell is this?

255
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,604
The results of my shopping trip,
all done in two hours.

256
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,897
- Impossible.
- I'm a savant.

257
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,648
- Everything's returnable?
- Yes, now sit down and relax.

258
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:41,193
- I'll show you what I got.
- Can I have my credit card?

259
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:42,360
Fine.

260
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:46,906
- Looks tired.
- Where's Rachel?

261
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,741
- She's out running some errands.
- Good.

262
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:51,952
Last week, we were talking about
Meryl Streep and the accent thing.

263
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:55,580
Rachel said she loved Out of Africa,
but she never read the book, remember?

264
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:58,624
- No.
- Okay, so I was like:

265
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:02,544
'Are you crazy?
Isak Dinesen is amazing. I love her'...

266
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:04,838
which is crap
'cause I never read the book either.

267
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:08,883
But Rory told me it was amazing. So I felt
pretty confident in my recommendation of:

268
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,676
- Out of Africa.
- You bought her a book?

269
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,805
No, you bought her a book,
to be put in her brand-new...

270
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:17,849
- camera bag.
- She's got a camera bag.

271
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,100
- It's nylon.
- So?

272
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:22,478
This one's leather. Beautiful leather.
Feel it. Smell it.

273
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,105
I'm not gonna smell that bag.

274
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:26,857
Don't smell it.
But trust me, she's gonna love it.

275
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:29,943
Her old bag is falling apart,
so she was gonna get a new one.

276
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:31,778
Now you'll have beaten her to it.

277
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:34,155
- So it's practical.
- And pretty.

278
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:37,575
- That seems right.
- You like?

279
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:40,536
- Yeah, thanks.
- Good.

280
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:43,914
- What's all this?
- Well, Luke...

281
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:46,999
- timing is a beautiful thing.
- It is?

282
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,794
It is. So I'm at the mall
and already found Rachel's gifts.

283
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:51,504
I've had two sugar-cinnamon pretzels.

284
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:54,006
I'm buzzed on the sugar
and jazzed with the purchases.

285
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,091
I take a victory lap
through Bloomingdale's...

286
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:59,844
and it just so happens there was
an amazing sale in the men's department.

287
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:02,513
I mean, gorgeous stuff. Look at this.

288
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,058
40% off! I got three different colors.

289
00:15:06,142 --> 00:15:07,267
- For who?
- For you.

290
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,352
- For me?
- Yeah.

291
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:11,271
Then, of course, beautiful pants, so soft.

292
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:13,981
I don't know what this fabric is,
but I wanna have its baby.

293
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:16,608
- Hold on a minute.
- Also, I got this fabulous belt...

294
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:18,819
to go with the sweater and pants.
Simple. Black.

295
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:20,946
- But look at the buckle.
- I don't need a belt.

296
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,740
- Great buckle. 60% off. Can you believe it?
- I can't. Look...

297
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,451
Also, I picked up a couple of shirty shirts...

298
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,828
if you didn't have a nice one
to go with your suit.

299
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,079
What suit?

300
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:32,956
- This one!
- Did no one at the mall notice...

301
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,375
you were going through
a psychotic episode?

302
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,293
This suit, 175% off.

303
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,170
You're not supposed
to be shopping for me.

304
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:42,465
I thought you'd like something new
to wear when you take Rachel out.

305
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:43,758
Thank you, but take it back.

306
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,217
- Just try them on.
- No way.

307
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:47,844
- You might like how you look.
- I'm fine with my clothes.

308
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:50,972
Okay, see this blazer? It was 175,000% off.

309
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:54,225
- Why the sudden need to dress me?
- I thought you might look nice...

310
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,644
- and since they were 600,000% off...
- No.

311
00:15:56,686 --> 00:15:58,646
Come on, Luke! Just try something on.

312
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:00,188
- How about this sweater?
- No.

313
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:03,524
- How about the pants? Pretty pants!
- I'm not trying anything on.

314
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:07,444
The lumberjack look will never go out.
Won't it be nice not to be dressed...

315
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:09,696
like an extra in
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers?

316
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:11,532
- Take it back.
- Come on, just the jacket.

317
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:14,826
Just once, be too sexy for your shirt
and do a dance on the catwalk.

318
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,578
Get away from me, you mental patient!

319
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:20,372
If we read his works in order,
we can see his progression...

320
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:24,376
from a narrative of clear simplicity
to one of rich complexity.

321
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:27,670
Now, this is not homework.
But I strongly urge you...

322
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:31,507
if you have not already read
The Art of Fiction, read it.

323
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:34,885
It's a remarkable manifesto
that contains basic truths...

324
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,721
that still apply to fiction in any form.

325
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,600
All right. So, Henry James,
the man of the moment.

326
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:43,976
Pick your book, read it carefully.

327
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,771
A full report on my desk
one week from today. Any questions?

328
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:50,983
Ms. Gilmore, any questions?

329
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:56,821
- Ms. Gilmore?
- Yes?

330
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:59,906
- Did you hear the assignment?
- No, I'm sorry.

331
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:01,909
Henry James. Pick your novel.

332
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,870
A report on my desk in one week.
You got it?

333
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,538
- Yes, I got it.
- See you tomorrow.

334
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,084
You didn't take one note.

335
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,545
You resorting to
the osmosis theory of learning?

336
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:17,464
- Why do you care?
- I don't. Just making an observation.

337
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:21,718
Great. We'll build a dome over you
and jam a telescope in your head.

338
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:26,179
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Okay.

339
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:28,390
- Toodles.
- Ta!

340
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:31,017
I'll get working on that dome.

341
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,647
- So how are you?
- Fine.

342
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,691
You seemed a little distracted today.

343
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:40,442
I didn't sleep well last night.

344
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:43,069
You've seemed to be distracted
for quite a while now.

345
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:45,821
- My grades are fine.
- I'm not concerned about grades.

346
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,781
I'm concerned about you.

347
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:51,869
Look, Rory, I know you've been going
through kind of a tough time lately...

348
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:54,787
and I just want you to know,
if you want to talk, I'm here.

349
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:57,123
- Tough time?
- Breakups are really hard.

350
00:17:57,165 --> 00:17:58,416
We've all been there.

351
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,584
- How do you know about that?
- Your mom told me.

352
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:02,961
- She what?
- Please, don't be upset at her.

353
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:06,632
It came out in one of our conversations.
She's very concerned, frustrated...

354
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:08,675
- You've been talking to my mom?
- Yes.

355
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,719
- Since when?
- It's been three weeks now, I guess.

356
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:13,888
- Are you dating?
- No, not really.

357
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:18,224
I mean, we were talking about
possibly this weekend, having dinner...

358
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,977
You didn't know anything
about this, did you?

359
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,771
Then the look on your face
makes perfect sense now.

360
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:26,648
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring this
on you like this.

361
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,109
It's fine. Don't worry.

362
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:31,611
- I'm sure she was gonna tell you soon.
- I'm sure, too.

363
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,988
Okay. So...

364
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,364
- Bus.
- Excuse me?

365
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,491
- Lf I don't go, I'm gonna miss it.
- Go ahead.

366
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,535
- Thanks for the talk.
- Any time.

367
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,334
- Come on!
- I hate you very much.

368
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,336
Save the sweet talk for Rachel.
Get out here!

369
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,880
Excuse me, sir,
do you know where Luke is?

370
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,508
- Very funny.
- My God, Luke, is that you?

371
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:58,135
I feel ridiculous.

372
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:01,804
That's because you don't
have the belt on. Here.

373
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,848
- What are you doing?
- It's called accessorizing.

374
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:07,851
- I can put a belt on myself, thank you.
- Okay, sorry.

375
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:10,562
- What?
- I just...

376
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:13,898
I just have exceptional taste, is all.

377
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:16,150
- Turn around.
- What?

378
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:19,028
I just want to make sure it all fits.
Turn around.

379
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:21,655
Fabio, I need the ketchup.

380
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:24,032
- Can you get that guy some ketchup?
- Why me?

381
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:26,659
If I spill stuff on this,
I won't be able to return it.

382
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:29,537
- You are not returning those clothes.
- Yes, I am.

383
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:30,830
Try on the suit again.

384
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:33,499
- I tried it on twice.
- I wanna see it with the black shirt.

385
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,667
I'm not wearing a black suit
with a black shirt.

386
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,002
- Regis does.
- Okay, you've won me over now.

387
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,462
At least try on the jacket again.

388
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:43,715
Is this how you like your guys,
all GQ'd up?

389
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:46,343
Not GQ'd up. Just a little less casual.

390
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:49,012
- And you don't like casual.
- I like casual fine.

391
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:52,890
- Just not on me.
- No, it just adds variety.

392
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:57,227
It's not'let's make a new Luke. '
It's'let's see another side of the old one. '

393
00:19:57,686 --> 00:19:59,896
You missed a loop. Come here.

394
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:02,523
What did you do?

395
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:05,234
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, hi.

396
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,406
- This is not what it looks like.
- It looks like you're dressing him.

397
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:14,367
- Then this is exactly what it looks like.
- There was a sale at Bloomingdale's...

398
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:17,661
- Six trillion percent off.
- How can you walk away from that?

399
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,289
I'm gonna change now.

400
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:23,000
Good. I'm gonna get Rory,
and just enjoy the clothes.

401
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,377
- I will.
- Okay, good. See you later, Rachel.

402
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:28,129
- Bye.
- Bye.

403
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,343
- I'm gonna change.
- Okay.

404
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,903
- Hi.
- Hi.

405
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:59,114
I thought you might like some coffee,
since you always do.

406
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:00,407
Thanks.

407
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:04,911
So this feels very awkward.

408
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:08,456
I'm a big girl, Lane. I don't need you
to protect me from things.

409
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,958
I didn't want to make you
any sadder than you are.

410
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:14,128
How is telling me Dean is your
study partner gonna make me sadder?

411
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:16,045
I don't wanna bring up his name
around you.

412
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,923
- That's crazy.
- Have you seen your face...

413
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:19,715
- when you mention Dean?
- My face is fine.

414
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,675
It's not. Your face is far from fine.

415
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,760
- I'll get over it.
- You're not over it yet.

416
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:26,430
Maybe I'd get over it quicker
if everyone weren't so busy...

417
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:29,725
trying to protect me from all the bad,
scary things in the world.

418
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:32,602
- Fine, I won't protect you anymore.
- Great. Glad to hear it.

419
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:36,147
Next time we walk down the street
and you're about to walk into traffic...

420
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,732
- I'll give you a push.
- Exactly what I'm talking about.

421
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:40,484
In the spirit of not protecting you...

422
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:43,527
I was gonna tell you
I couldn't study'cause I had Bible class.

423
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:45,405
But that's not true. I have to meet Dean.

424
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:48,031
- Thanks for the honesty.
- I'll have to see him again...

425
00:21:48,116 --> 00:21:50,284
- 'cause the project's due Monday.
- I don't care.

426
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:51,660
I'll see you when I see you.

427
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,744
- Fine!
- Fine.

428
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:53,870
Bye.

429
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,792
- Where's Lane going?
- Away.

430
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:02,336
Okay, you've been in this mood
for a week now...

431
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:04,755
and while I love the ups and downs
of motherhood...

432
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:07,757
I gotta say, I'm tired of Goofus,
and I'd like my Gallant back.

433
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:12,052
You can't say a normal sentence, right?
Just 'hey, let's talk' is too dull for you.

434
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:14,013
- Hey, let's talk.
- About what?

435
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:16,347
Wait, I know.
How about you and Mr. Medina?

436
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,641
- What?
- I heard you've gotten back together again.

437
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:19,684
Did you talk to Max?

438
00:22:19,768 --> 00:22:22,687
He had me stay after class
to talk about my breakup situation.

439
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:26,274
We are not dating. We've been talking,
and we now decided to start dating.

440
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:28,191
Why didn't you tell me
you've been talking?

441
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:31,111
Because it was so much like
the Todd and Nevena Cutler thing.

442
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:32,863
- What?
- When I was in junior high...

443
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:35,990
I had a boyfriend, Todd something
or other. Not a soul mate.

444
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:38,492
But I was crazy about him,
and he dumped me.

445
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:41,661
I was completely crushed
and could only lie around and cry...

446
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:44,206
and listen to Air Supply.
A very low point in my life.

447
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:46,333
Two days later, my best friend,
Nevena Cutler...

448
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,501
got back with her boyfriend,
Randy something...

449
00:22:48,585 --> 00:22:50,461
who dumped her days before
Todd dumped me.

450
00:22:50,545 --> 00:22:52,379
She was so happy and gloaty...

451
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:55,381
and kept talking how great it was
to have her boyfriend back...

452
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,759
- that it made me feel horrible.
- The end. Let's go.

453
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,220
Look, I didn't want
to be Nevena Cutler, okay?

454
00:23:00,303 --> 00:23:03,055
You were so miserable about Dean.
What was I supposed to do?

455
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:06,391
Say, 'Sorry about you and Dean.
But I got Max back and are we happy. '

456
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:08,268
- Would that be good?
- That would be great.

457
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,228
I was going to tell you, okay?

458
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,731
I just wanted to give you some space
and a chance to come up for air.

459
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:16,859
I was trying to protect you. That's all.

460
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:21,071
It doesn't matter if you tell me about Max
or not. You'll break up again anyway.

461
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:22,864
- Excuse me.
- That's what you do best.

462
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:24,031
Stop right there.

463
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:26,409
You'll break up, cry,
get back together, break up.

464
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:29,328
It doesn't really matter.
I'd rather not have to keep track.

465
00:23:29,412 --> 00:23:31,538
So tell me when you're down
to the final inning.

466
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,957
That is way too snotty a thing
even for alternate-universe Rory to say.

467
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:38,253
- I'd like an apology.
- Fine, I apologize. Let's go home.

468
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:41,380
Yeah. Let's go home
and try that apology again.

469
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,216
- What are you doing?
- We need light bulbs.

470
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,636
- We're fine.
- We're in the dark. It'll take a minute.

471
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,762
- I assume you won't come in.
- Is it Wednesday?

472
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,472
- No.
- Then I can't, can I?

473
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,390
What does Wednesday
have to do with this?

474
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,434
Nothing. I'll meet you at home.

475
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,859
Rory, I'm back for round two.

476
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,239
I got some Silly String
in case things get really ugly.

477
00:24:18,037 --> 00:24:19,538
Where are you?

478
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:26,127
Answer, please.

479
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:35,468
This is the fourth ridiculous gathering
you've dragged me to this week.

480
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:37,804
I'm the president of the board.
I have to be there.

481
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,515
Saving the Bowringenee pansy.
Who's heard of such a thing?

482
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:43,935
It's a rare flower that's disappearing
from the face of this earth.

483
00:24:43,976 --> 00:24:44,976
Who cares?

484
00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:48,605
As President of the Horticultural Society,
I have to care.

485
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:52,692
The last thing I need is to spend four hours
being bored out of my skull...

486
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:57,113
by the same people I'll be bored by
tomorrow at the Symphony Fundraiser.

487
00:24:57,155 --> 00:25:00,282
We need to get your tux back
from the cleaners tomorrow.

488
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,617
No, I'll be dead tomorrow.

489
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:04,201
I plan on flinging myself
off the roof tonight...

490
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:06,829
right in the middle
of Pitty Salenger's opening speech.

491
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:09,331
Pitty is a dear friend,
and you will be nice to her.

492
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,418
She is a dipsomaniac.
I'm going to bring my newspaper.

493
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:15,795
You will do no such thing, Richard.
Do you hear me?

494
00:25:19,674 --> 00:25:21,759
- Rory.
- Hi, Grandma.

495
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:29,265
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

496
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:34,061
- Richard, pay the cab.
- Cab? Who took a cab?

497
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:36,647
- Rory did.
- What's Rory doing here?

498
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:39,858
- Hello, Rory.
- Hi.

499
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:43,153
I don't know what she's doing here.
Pay the man, and I'll find out.

500
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:44,821
For Pete's sake.

501
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:46,739
Come inside.

502
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,535
Now, tell me, what is going on?

503
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:55,830
I had a fight with Mom.

504
00:25:55,872 --> 00:25:59,083
- You had a fight with your mother?
- I just couldn't take it anymore.

505
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:01,460
- I had to get out of there.
- Out of your house?

506
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:05,213
Out of that house, that town, everything.
I just had to go.

507
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:08,382
He tacked on an extra $5 just for waiting.

508
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:10,426
I feel like I'm back in Prague.

509
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,012
- Do you want a cocktail?
- No, thanks.

510
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:16,014
- Richard!
- Sorry.

511
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:19,642
- I'm just a little confused here.
- You're all dressed up.

512
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:21,853
You were going out. I'm so sorry.

513
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:24,313
- Please, don't be.
- It doesn't matter, Rory.

514
00:26:24,397 --> 00:26:27,065
Sorry. Please go out.
I didn't mean to ruin your evening.

515
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:29,943
- I didn't think. I should've called.
- You calm down, right now.

516
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:33,279
You don't need to call before you
come here. You are welcome any time.

517
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:35,072
Tonight especially.

518
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:37,992
- You want to talk about what happened?
- Emily, don't pry.

519
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:41,869
- I'm not prying.
- The girl obviously needs some peace.

520
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:44,038
- How do you know that?
- I can tell.

521
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:45,957
You're a mind reader now. How nice.

522
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,584
We'll get you a turban
and a booth by the train station.

523
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:51,378
Would it be okay if I stay here tonight?

524
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:54,423
- Of course.
- You can stay as long as you want.

525
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:56,132
- Thanks.
- Would you like some dinner?

526
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:57,842
I can get Rosa to make you something.

527
00:26:57,926 --> 00:27:01,637
- No, I'd just like to go to bed if that's okay.
- Of course. Whatever you like.

528
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:05,557
Your room's all ready. There are pajamas
and a new toothbrush in the bathroom.

529
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,600
It's pink, with sparkles.

530
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:10,394
- I thought you'd like it.
- Thanks.

531
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,900
- Good night, Grandpa.
- Good night, Rory.

532
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:22,280
Everything's going to be fine.
Richard, say something encouraging.

533
00:27:22,322 --> 00:27:24,949
Rory, I'm sorry you're upset...

534
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,743
but I applaud your timing.

535
00:27:28,453 --> 00:27:30,079
See you tomorrow.

536
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:33,457
Emily, what is all this about?

537
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,543
She had a fight with Lorelai.

538
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:39,087
And she came here.

539
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:44,841
Mrs. Kim, it's Lorelai. Is Lane there?

540
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:47,177
Do you know where she is?

541
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,637
That's unbelievable.
You always know where she is.

542
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,264
The one time I need you
to be crazy prison guard lady...

543
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:54,391
you're all, 'Hey, man, whatever. '

544
00:27:54,892 --> 00:27:58,311
You know what? I'll never be able
to explain that to your satisfaction.

545
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:02,773
So could you ask Lane to call me
when she gets back? I'm looking for Rory.

546
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:06,027
No, I don't know where she is.
Don't 'ha' me.

547
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,612
You don't know where Lane is, either.

548
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:10,030
Anything?

549
00:28:10,114 --> 00:28:12,491
Patty hasn't seen her
but she's been working all day.

550
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:14,242
She's not at the library or at Luke's.

551
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,119
Where is she?
Why didn't she leave a note?

552
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,370
- Damn it!
- Honey, calm down.

553
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:20,038
But Rory doesn't take off.
She knows it'll make me crazy.

554
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:23,333
She knows it would make me worry.
I'm crossing over into panic now.

555
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,460
No, don't cross. Come back.

556
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:30,547
- You find her?
- No, nothing. No one's seen her.

557
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:31,715
Okay.

558
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:34,676
- What about that old boyfriend of hers?
- Dean.

559
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,261
I'm on my way.

560
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,680
Good suggestion. You get crisis points.

561
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,808
- Max, I'm freaking out.
- It's gonna be okay.

562
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,685
Sookie's here, I'm here. We will find her.

563
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:50,523
Rory?

564
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:52,858
I just want you to know
that Rory is here with us.

565
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:55,486
- What?
- She arrived a few minutes ago.

566
00:28:55,737 --> 00:28:58,364
- She's there? Is she okay?
- She's fine.

567
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:00,199
She asked to spend the night.

568
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:03,868
Okay, she's there with you.
So how did she get there?

569
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,370
- She took a cab.
- Let me talk to her.

570
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,164
She seems quite upset.
She said you'd had a fight.

571
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:11,542
- We had a disagreement.
- She said fight.

572
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,543
Will you put her on the phone,
please, Mom?

573
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,170
I think we should give her time
to collect herself.

574
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,965
Thank you for your input.
Can I please talk to my daughter?

575
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,217
- She went to her room, Lorelai.
- Her room is here.

576
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:25,554
Mom, I'm standing here
looking at her room, and she's not in it.

577
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,473
Lorelai, I did not come to your house
and kidnap this child.

578
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:32,185
She ran from you, and she came here.
She's tired, and she's upset.

579
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:33,936
I think we should just let her sleep...

580
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,523
and in the morning, we can argue about
how to best handle the situation.

581
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:40,734
Maybe some time away from each other
will do you both good.

582
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:42,568
I'll pick her up in the morning.

583
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:45,696
She has school tomorrow,
and her school's 10 minutes from here.

584
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,197
I'll pick her up after school.

585
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,075
Why don't you call tomorrow
when she gets back from school?

586
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:53,203
Make sure she wants to go.
You don't want to haul her back home...

587
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:56,580
- just to have her jump in a cab again.
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.

588
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:58,165
Goodnight, Lorelai.

589
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:02,294
So?

590
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:07,007
- She's with my parents in Hartford.
- Good.

591
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,799
- Good?
- Bad?

592
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:10,884
- Bad. Very bad.
- She's safe.

593
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:13,429
She's with my mother.
No one is safe with my mother.

594
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,097
- She needed some space.
- No, that house is not safe.

595
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,891
It's like The Amityville Horror
without all the good times.

596
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:22,687
- Lf it's that bad, you should go get her.
- No, she wanted to get away from me.

597
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,604
She wants to be alone.

598
00:30:24,814 --> 00:30:26,815
Let's give her her space.

599
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:33,780
You okay?

600
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,906
I can't believe she left me to go there.

601
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,950
We used to always be able
to work this out.

602
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:39,451
What did you two fight about?

603
00:30:39,493 --> 00:30:40,660
- You?
- Me?

604
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:44,080
It started with you and that
I didn't tell her we were talking again...

605
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:47,458
but that was only part of it
because she's been in such a bad place...

606
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:51,170
with this whole Dean thing.
So I guess it was coming.

607
00:30:52,796 --> 00:30:54,630
I just wish she hadn't run away.

608
00:30:54,673 --> 00:30:58,134
She will be back,
and you two will work everything out.

609
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,096
- You're good at the comforting thing.
- Thank you.

610
00:31:02,805 --> 00:31:04,765
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

611
00:31:04,807 --> 00:31:07,809
- Can I ask you a question?
- I think you've earned it.

612
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:10,311
Why didn't you tell Rory about us?

613
00:31:10,478 --> 00:31:12,813
She was so upset about Dean...

614
00:31:12,856 --> 00:31:16,442
I didn't think it was the best time
to give her my happy news.

615
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:18,985
Okay. But you've told other people?

616
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:22,321
- What other people?
- I don't know, friends, Sookie?

617
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:24,949
No, actually, I haven't.

618
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:26,659
Any reason?

619
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:29,870
It just hasn't come up.

620
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,246
- It hasn't?
- No.

621
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,665
You're not avoiding
talking about it, are you?

622
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:34,999
No, Max, come on.

623
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,793
- It just seems a little strange to me.
- Why is it strange?

624
00:31:37,836 --> 00:31:40,546
We've been talking for at least two weeks.

625
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,673
I thought at some point
it would've come up.

626
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:46,425
You don't say to people out of the blue,
'Max and I are talking again. '

627
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,304
I was just waiting
for it to come up naturally.

628
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:53,724
Somehow, for me, it managed to come up
naturally within two days three times.

629
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:56,310
You're obviously a better people-person
than I am.

630
00:31:56,352 --> 00:31:58,895
If there's a reason
why you don't want people to know...

631
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:01,189
- then we must talk about that.
- There's no reason.

632
00:32:01,273 --> 00:32:02,315
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

633
00:32:02,357 --> 00:32:04,358
- Okay.
- Do you believe me?

634
00:32:04,484 --> 00:32:06,861
If you said there's no reason,
there's no reason.

635
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:07,986
- So you said.
- So I mean.

636
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,112
- Okay.
- All right.

637
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:10,572
That's fine.

638
00:32:12,824 --> 00:32:15,201
I should page Sookie
and tell her that Rory's okay.

639
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:16,994
That's a good idea.

640
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,503
- Good morning.
- Rory, good morning.

641
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:30,547
Grandma, any thoughts
on where my skirt might be?

642
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,342
I gave it to Rosa to press.
Sit down. Have some breakfast.

643
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,553
Your skirt will be done
by the time you're finished.

644
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:40,598
Now, we have eggs, fruit, toast...

645
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:44,060
- pancakes, and blintzes.
- Anything would be fine.

646
00:32:44,143 --> 00:32:47,020
- What do you usually eat?
- Mostly I just grab a Pop-Tart.

647
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:49,939
That sounds delicious.
I'll have Rosa whip one up for you.

648
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:52,900
- No, eggs would be great.
- I'll go tell her.

649
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:58,196
So, Grandpa,
what's new in the world today?

650
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,782
As usual, it's going to hell in a handbasket.

651
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:03,785
It's nice to have something
you can always count on.

652
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:05,370
It is, at that.

653
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:08,414
- Would you like part of the paper?
- Please.

654
00:33:08,498 --> 00:33:11,083
- Your eggs will be right out.
- Thanks.

655
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,880
- So, did you sleep well?
- The bed was very comfortable.

656
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:19,757
But you didn't sleep well?

657
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:22,885
- No, I did. I just...
- I talked to your mother last night.

658
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:26,137
I told her you'd stay here.
She said she'd call this afternoon.

659
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,597
Was she mad?

660
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:30,099
She was concerned.

661
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,146
So, do you get your lunch at school,
or do you bring it with you?

662
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,773
Because Rosa made
a fabulous leg of lamb yesterday.

663
00:33:38,857 --> 00:33:42,651
- I bet it'd make a wonderful sandwich.
- Take her up on that. It is good.

664
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:45,655
- And demand a slice of strudel.
- Okay.

665
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,448
- I demand some strudel.
- Good.

666
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:51,075
So, what's going on at school today?

667
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:54,204
- I have a test in Spanish.
- Are you prepared?

668
00:33:54,454 --> 00:33:56,163
Yeah. I like Spanish.

669
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:58,040
Biology, on the other hand...

670
00:33:58,124 --> 00:33:59,458
I'm still waiting for the day...

671
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,961
when my knowledge of the inner workings
of a frog's intestinal system...

672
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:05,338
can be applied to my work
in the insurance industry.

673
00:34:05,422 --> 00:34:07,924
Perhaps if you were insuring the frog.

674
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:11,468
Thank you.

675
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:14,096
- This looks great.
- Good.

676
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:18,391
- Thanks again for letting me stay.
- It's nice having you here.

677
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:21,894
You got Grandpa to put down
his newspaper at breakfast. That's a first.

678
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:24,271
- Now, Emily.
- Well, it is.

679
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,447
Jeez, what happened to you?

680
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,283
- A happy how-do-you-do to you, too.
- Sorry. You look bad.

681
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,410
- I didn't get much sleep last night.
- Why not?

682
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:42,579
- Rory and I had a fight, and she ran away.
- What? Where? Did you...

683
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,122
She's fine. She's at my mother's.

684
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:47,583
God! Throw that in with the first part.
You'll scare a person to death.

685
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:51,128
Sorry. You know,
I got in my car three times to go get her.

686
00:34:51,212 --> 00:34:54,298
I drove halfway there and drove back.

687
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:57,133
I actually ran out of gas
driving halfway there and back.

688
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:59,677
- She'll cool off and come home.
- I know.

689
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:02,179
This breaking up with Dean
has been so hard on her.

690
00:35:02,221 --> 00:35:05,432
I just hate that she's going through this.
She's such a good kid.

691
00:35:05,516 --> 00:35:08,268
She's so nice to everyone,
she cares about everyone...

692
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:10,728
and she's walking around
in this unbelievable pain.

693
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:12,438
There's nothing I can do about it.

694
00:35:12,522 --> 00:35:14,607
She won't talk to me,
or tell me what happened.

695
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,691
I'll tell you what happened. Dean's a jerk...

696
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:19,527
- and he let her know it.
- I wish I could pinch his head off.

697
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:21,988
- I'll help.
- I warned him when I first met him...

698
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,032
if he hurt her... Maybe I could key his car.

699
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:27,659
Or better, you can key Taylor's car
and say Dean did it.

700
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:30,787
- That'd be good.
- Then key Taylor's car, tell him Dean did it.

701
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:35,291
Also tell him that Dean littered
and walks his dog without a leash.

702
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,752
- He'll run him out of town.
- Good.

703
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:41,672
All right, I should go.
Rory's probably out of school by now...

704
00:35:41,714 --> 00:35:44,049
and I want to be home
in case she decides to call.

705
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:46,384
- Coffee's on the house.
- Thanks.

706
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:49,971
- Is that the belt I bought you?
- Yeah, the old one broke.

707
00:35:50,054 --> 00:35:52,514
Lucky you happened to have a spare.

708
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:55,600
She'll be home soon.

709
00:36:28,338 --> 00:36:30,172
- Got a minute?
- Actually...

710
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:32,633
I just want to tell you
that I think you are scum.

711
00:36:32,716 --> 00:36:33,716
Gee, thanks.

712
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:37,595
You'll be hard-pressed to find another girl
as fantastic as Rory. You know that?

713
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,557
She is beautiful and smart and did not
deserve to be treated that way by you.

714
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,767
- Treated what way?
- I thought you were a good guy.

715
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:45,727
I thought you were
going to make her happy.

716
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:48,020
I'm an idiot to have thought
you were a good pick.

717
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,065
But I was wrong, and I hate to be wrong.

718
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:53,442
I am sick and tired of everyone
blaming this thing on me.

719
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:57,570
I mean, you and this stupid town
looking at me like I'm a criminal.

720
00:36:57,947 --> 00:37:02,867
I say, 'I love you,' and she just sits there,
and I'm the jerk? I'm the bad guy?

721
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:05,786
- What?
- You know what? Think what you want.

722
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,247
I don't care. Just leave me alone.

723
00:37:23,052 --> 00:37:25,303
- Where is she?
- I thought you were gonna call.

724
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:26,429
Where is she, Mom?

725
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:28,597
I haven't had any time
to prepare her for this.

726
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,225
- Mom, where is she?
- Upstairs in her room.

727
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:33,811
She got home from school,
but just went right upstairs.

728
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:36,145
She didn't want a snack,
but I had Rosa make one.

729
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,814
I haven't checked if she's eaten it.

730
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:40,608
She had a decent breakfast this morning,
but seemed tired.

731
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,193
When I went to her bathroom,
the aspirin bottle was out.

732
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,780
I assume she had a headache.
I don't know if it was last...

733
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,281
Excuse me, Mr. Cosell,
I appreciate the play-by-play...

734
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:49,992
but I want to talk to my daughter now.

735
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:53,494
- Do you want me to go in there with you?
- More than anything.

736
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,121
- Try and be nice.
- Thanks for the tip.

737
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,001
- Hey.
- Mom.

738
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:04,546
Okay, so, I thought when you said,
'I'll see you at home'...

739
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:07,673
- you meant our home. My mistake.
- I'm so sorry.

740
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:09,883
It's okay.

741
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:11,718
- All of those things...
- I know.

742
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:13,136
- And then...
- It's no big deal.

743
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:15,264
- I'm just so...
- I know, I know.

744
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:20,267
The last time I saw you, you were
headed home. Wanna fill in the blanks?

745
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:22,894
I don't know. I just snapped...

746
00:38:23,688 --> 00:38:26,315
and I got sick of everything.
I wanted to go anywhere.

747
00:38:26,357 --> 00:38:27,482
So you picked hell?

748
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:30,860
- It was the first place that came to mind.
- I respect that.

749
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:35,531
The need to run is a feeling
I am well acquainted with.

750
00:38:35,573 --> 00:38:38,075
But we have to be able to talk, always.

751
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,702
No matter how mad or upset
we get with each other...

752
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:44,038
our particular special thing only works
if we agree to that, get it?

753
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,706
- I get it.
- Good.

754
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,459
Rory, tell me what happened
with you and Dean.

755
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:51,544
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I do.

756
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:55,173
- Why?
- Because I had a little chat with him today.

757
00:38:55,257 --> 00:38:56,424
What? Why?

758
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:59,343
Because I was upset
and in the mood to do a little yelling.

759
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:00,719
- You didn't.
- I did.

760
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:02,721
- No.
- There he was, stacking cookies...

761
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:05,348
and I'm railing on him about
what a great kid you are...

762
00:39:05,432 --> 00:39:10,227
and how it sucked that he dumped you,
and then he said he told you he loved you.

763
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,898
- And I started feeling a little stupid.
- He did tell me.

764
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,984
- And you didn't say anything?
- No.

765
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:20,027
- It must've been rough on him.
- He looked so hurt.

766
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,406
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to hurt him.

767
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:27,117
- I just got scared and I sat there.
- I understand.

768
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:32,622
You know, I'm still learning this stuff, too.
Since I'm still learning...

769
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:36,709
I think I haven't thought enough about
what I'm supposed to be teaching you.

770
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,377
What are you talking about?

771
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:42,214
I'm talking about my own personal
lack of commitment skills.

772
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:47,510
I mean, look, I love that you have my eyes
and my coffee addiction...

773
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,928
and my taste in music and movies.

774
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,015
But when it comes
to love and relationships...

775
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,017
I don't necessarily want you to be like me.

776
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,438
I'd hate to think that I raised a kid
who couldn't say 'I love you. '

777
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:03,065
- Mom.
- I'm not talking specifically about Dean.

778
00:40:03,107 --> 00:40:07,027
I mean, just generally in life. For example,
say you're dating Taylor Hanson.

779
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:10,572
- Why am I dating Taylor Hanson?
- It's a hypothetical scenario. Go with it.

780
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:12,948
So you and Taylor
are seeing each other regularly.

781
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:15,700
- How did I meet Taylor Hanson?
- You went to his concert.

782
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:20,372
You got backstage. Your eyes met across
the crowd and you're seeing each other.

783
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:23,124
- Hanson's still together?
- They're the new Bee Gees.

784
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:26,002
Why would you not stop me
from going to a Hanson concert?

785
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:28,837
- Someone's trying to make a point here.
- Sorry. Go ahead.

786
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:32,298
So you and Taylor have been dating
for a while and things are great...

787
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:33,926
and you're happy.

788
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:37,595
You feel all those crazy mushy things
that people feel when they're in love.

789
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,141
I want you to be able to say to him:
'Taylor, I love you. '

790
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:45,935
Can we pick a new hypothetical,
'cause this one's wigging me out?

791
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:49,689
My point is that it's scary to be in love.
That much I know.

792
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:54,485
But it's also wonderful and special.
And if you can't say it or fully express it...

793
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,154
then you're never gonna
be able to experience it.

794
00:40:57,238 --> 00:41:01,366
I want you to experience everything
that's great because you're so great.

795
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:03,909
- Are you hearing me?
- Yeah, I'm hearing you.

796
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:07,120
I'm not saying you say 'I love you'
at the drop of a hat.

797
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:09,706
It has to be right and real...

798
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:12,708
and it has to take a lot of thought.

799
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:15,502
But someday, with someone,
it will be right.

800
00:41:15,587 --> 00:41:18,130
I want you to be ready for that moment
when it happens.

801
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:21,216
Are you ready for that moment
when it happens?

802
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:22,968
I'm working on it.

803
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:27,096
I do, however, know
what dress I'll be wearing.

804
00:41:28,723 --> 00:41:31,308
- Thank you guys so much.
- It was our pleasure.

805
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,853
- What do I owe you for the cab?
- Don't worry about that.

806
00:41:34,937 --> 00:41:37,355
- Thanks for sharing your paper.
- Any time.

807
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:40,983
- And thank you, Mom.
- Of course. She's our granddaughter.

808
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,527
- All right. We'll see you tomorrow night.
- 7:00.

809
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:47,447
- Really, is it 7:00, 'cause I wasn't...
- Goodbye, Lorelai.

810
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,788
Looks like it's just the two of us again.

811
00:41:56,873 --> 00:41:58,207
I guess so.

812
00:42:02,377 --> 00:42:05,129
I was almost tempted to see
if she could make a Pop-Tart.

813
00:42:05,213 --> 00:42:07,965
Wow, home-cooked breakfast,
homemade lunch.

814
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:10,717
I'm trying to remember why I left there.
Yeah, my parents.

815
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:12,427
Funny, funny girl.

816
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:14,846
- Let me out here.
- Okay.

817
00:42:15,305 --> 00:42:17,848
- I'll meet you back at the house.
- Excuse me?

818
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:21,227
- I'll show up this time.
- I'll have the pizza waiting.

819
00:42:58,593 --> 00:42:59,718
Hello?

820
00:43:00,136 --> 00:43:05,098
Now, I'm starting with the'A's,'
so first up is Richie Andrews.

821
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,475
He's either a second cousin
on my mother's side...

822
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:09,519
or the guy who re-grouted the bathroom.

823
00:43:09,602 --> 00:43:12,938
Either way, I think he's gonna be thrilled
to hear about us.

824
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:15,607
After I've called everyone in here...

825
00:43:15,691 --> 00:43:17,901
I'm gonna spread the word at the Inn.

826
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,779
I thought I'd put little notices
in everyone's rooms...

827
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:25,157
'Welcome to the Independence Inn.
Max and Lorelai are back together. '

828
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:27,367
Can I see you after your dinner
tomorrow night?

829
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:32,288
I don't know. I have a lot of phone calls
to make. The Internet. Let's go global!

830
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:34,248
- Good night, Lorelai.
- Good night.

831
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,633
Richie? It's Lorelai.
