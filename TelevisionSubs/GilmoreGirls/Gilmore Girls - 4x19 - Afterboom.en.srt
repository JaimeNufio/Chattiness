1
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,267
Oh, I left a tip this time.

2
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:41,750
And I didn't put it under the water glass, 'cause I know you hate that,

3
00:00:41,806 --> 00:00:44,177
and I made sure it didn't touch the syrup, 'cause that makes it sticky,

4
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:47,295
and I didn't leave the last dollar in pennies just to get rid of them.

5
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:47,838
I know.

6
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:49,532
So, why are you running down the street yelling at me?

7
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,559
I wasn't running. I was walking. I wasn't yelling. I was talking.

8
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,711
- Oh, what did you say? 
- "Hey."

9
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:55,605
- Oh, hey. 
- You are a lot of work.

10
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:57,208
No, you're a lot of work.

11
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:59,612
- You heading in there? 
- Yeah. I need stamps. You heading in there?

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,984
Yep. I'm getting my divorce.

13
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,313
What?

14
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:06,781
You're getting a mail-order divorce?

15
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,363
These are the papers we had drawn up before. I just have to sign them.

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,648
And you're signing them in there?

17
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:11,871
There's a notary in there.

18
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:15,113
- Luke, that is a Mail Boxes Etc. 
- So?

19
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:19,050
So, you buy envelopes at a Mail Boxes Etc. You don't get divorced at a Mail Boxes Etc.

20
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:21,938
- Why not? 
- Because, I don't -- it's not dignified.

21
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:25,127
Well, crapping out in a marriage isn't that dignified, either, but I did that.

22
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:25,885
Luke...

23
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,964
Look, I just want to get this over with. It's not a big deal.

24
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:30,565
- I just need to sign a piece of paper. 
- You're ending a marriage.

25
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:33,253
- I'm signing a paper... 
- ... that says you're ending a marriage.

26
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,768
- Please let me do this. 
- Why don't you go to a lawyer's office?

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,820
- I hate lawyers. 
- How about a friend's house?

28
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:40,503
- Dougie and Scooter are off at camp. 
- This is wrong.

29
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:44,128
- This is fine. This is practical. 
- Getting a divorce should not be practical.

30
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:46,858
I only have 20 minutes until I have to be back at work.

31
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:48,014
A divorce should not be rushed.

32
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:51,768
For someone who's never actually been through a divorce, you sure know a lot about it.

33
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:55,837
- You should take a few minutes to think. 
- I have thought. It's over. I know it's over.

34
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:59,324
And all I have to do is go in there and sign this paper in front of a notary,

35
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:01,229
and then it's officially over. I'm fine.

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,111
Please, I'm begging you -- let me get divorced.

37
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,670
- All right, then. Go ahead. 
- Thank you.

38
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,323
- I thought you needed stamps. 
- I can get them later.

39
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:17,926
- What are you doing? 
- I just thought I'd give you some privacy.

40
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:20,383
I'm not taking a shower -- I'm signing a paper.

41
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:23,547
- I can come back later. 
- Will you please get in there and buy your stamps?

42
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:26,035
- Okay, fine. 
- Lots and lots of work...

43
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,421
Welcome to Mail Boxes Etc. How may I help you?

44
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,192
- You go ahead. 
- I need to get something notarized.

45
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:38,477
Terrific. We are happy to help you with all of your mailing and notarizing needs.

46
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,158
I will need you to fill out your name and address, and then I will need a thumbprint.

47
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:44,114
- I know how it works, Kirk. 
- You have a pen?

48
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,047
I have a pen.

49
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:48,379
- What can I do for you today? 
- I can wait till he's done.

50
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:50,008
- She needs stamps. 
- I can wait till he's...

51
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,293
- Just get your stamps. Just get your stamps. 
- But, I...

52
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:53,592
Oh, my God, the work.

53
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:57,381
- I need stamps. 
- Well, your timing is perfect.

54
00:02:57,816 --> 00:03:00,878
The breakfast-food series just came out last week.

55
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:05,071
- Look at the dancing toast. 
- Aren't they a kick? And here is our cartoon series.

56
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:08,858
- Hey, do you have any Lucille Balls left? 
- Yes, I have some Balls.

57
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:13,529
I'm sorry. Are you a fan of the '50s-slash-mid-'60s sitcom heroines?

58
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,317
I don't know. Am I?

59
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,515
I think you are.

60
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:21,102
- "Bewitched?" I love "Bewitched." 
- Me too. Dr. Bombay was a big influence on me.

61
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:24,200
Oh, my God -- Serena? I wanted to be Serena. With that hair...

62
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:26,770
- And the miniskirts... 
- And the groovy, psychedelic music...

63
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,524
- Did you practice the twitch? 
- Oh, who didn't practice the twitch?

64
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:33,763
Tabitha was so lucky. And hey, what ever happened to her little brother Adam?

65
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:36,913
I mean, they determined in episode 242 that he was a warlock, and then...

66
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,029
I'm trying to get divorced here!

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,343
Sorry.

68
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,475
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:47,459
Remember when Endora called him "Derwood?"

70
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,389
Sorry.

71
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,161
Oh man. Beat up the toaster again?

72
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:50,718
This damn thing stopped working.

73
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:52,325
- Could get another one. 
- This one will be fine.

74
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,430
Sure -- as soon as it learns its place.

75
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,990
You gonna go ten rounds with the coffee maker... Ooh, thank you.

76
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:00,253
- What happened to your thumb? 
- It's from the thumbprint yesterday.

77
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:03,903
- I thought they had inkless pads now. 
- They do, Kirk doesn't.

78
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:04,722
Right.

79
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,018
He hasn't even heard of them.

80
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,007
He just uses the stuff that came in the notary kit he sent away for.

81
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,616
I've been scrubbing my thumb for two days. I've tried soap, I've tried cleaning fluid...

82
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,620
Have you tried fire?

83
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:16,104
Now not only am I divorced, every time I look at my black thumb,

84
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:18,781
- I'm reminded that I'm divorced. 
- Sorry about your thumb.

85
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:20,327
It's okay. I have another one.

86
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:22,524
- Hey, you know what might make you feel better? 
- What?

87
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:26,728
- Handing me a cherry Danish. 
- Well, it's certainly worth a try.

88
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:29,784
- Out. 
- But I just got my coffee.

89
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:30,599
Follow the thumb.

90
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:37,873
- Hello? 
- Who is this?

91
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,666
This is Lorelai Gilmore.

92
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:41,924
No, this is Lorelai Gilmore.

93
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:43,839
Ooh, "Gaslight."

94
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:47,136
- So, you have my phone. 
- Yes, you left it in the kitchen.

95
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:49,471
You know what that means, don't you? You miss Mommy.

96
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:52,369
Yes, or that the refrigerator was empty, and I ordered food.

97
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,833
Oh, that makes much more sense.

98
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:55,957
Just hold onto it for me? I'll get it from you next time I see you.

99
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,504
Okay -- ooh, hold on, hon.

100
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:02,367
Hello?

101
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:05,926
So, I'm officially taking the one hour I have off to go to the driving range

102
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:08,665
to hit golf balls to try to improve my sucky game,

103
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:11,085
thereby redeeming myself in your father's eyes.

104
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:14,057
I like the use of "sucky" and "thereby" in the same sentence.

105
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:15,589
- Hey, who's that? 
- It's Jason.

106
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,453
Tell him hi.

107
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,828
- Hey, Rory says hi. 
- Tell her hi back.

108
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:20,446
He says hi back. Hi.

109
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:21,967
This is a sickness.

110
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,278
- Well, I'll be in in a minute. 
- Who are you talking to?

111
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,806
- My other two personalities. 
- I'll bring this back inside.

112
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:27,651
Wait, wait -- bite.

113
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:30,998
A frightening picture of things to come.

114
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:32,791
Did you talk to anyone yet?

115
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,411
I left a message for Dad. I talked to Mom, but she just had her morning Mr. Happy pill,

116
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,964
so of course she was having a happy morning and was absolutely no help.

117
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:42,146
- But I'm on it. 
- A man on a mission.

118
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,617
- That's me. 
- Fire!

119
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,766
- What? 
- Nothing. I was just feeling left out.

120
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:46,543
Oh, sorry.

121
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:49,554
I figure, if he doesn't call me back by 4:00, I'll just go over there.

122
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:52,561
Okay, I'm at the club. I'm gonna hang up now.

123
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:53,722
- Call me later. 
- Me?

124
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,233
- No. 
- No?

125
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,497
- Not you. 
- Not me?

126
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:58,821
Uh, I'm confused. Who's hanging up now?

127
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,392
- Uh, that would be me. 
- Good. Okay. I'll talk to you later.

128
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:04,325
- Jason's gone. 
- Finally had enough of you.

129
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:06,634
Oh, yeah. It took three hours of my hula-dancing,

130
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:08,509
Small World doll impressions, but I broke him.

131
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:10,019
So, how's World War III going?

132
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:12,134
Oh, you know, the first boys off the boat were mowed down,

133
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,207
- but the next platoon is moving in. 
- Which means?

134
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,953
Jason's making the lawsuit go away.

135
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:17,458
Have you talked to Grandma or Grandpa yet?

136
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:18,174
No.

137
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,320
Have you tried to talk to Grandma or Grandpa yet?

138
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:21,057
No.

139
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:24,233
- That's my little Kofi Annan. 
- Jason will fix it.

140
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,639
- Jason's not their daughter. 
- Then he might have better luck.

141
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:28,483
Why didn't you just tell them that you guys were dating?

142
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:30,100
Oh, come on. You know why.

143
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:32,418
We were going to tell them when the time was right.

144
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,406
Of course, I had no idea we were dealing with the Carringtons.

145
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:38,327
All we needed was a swimming pool and some ball gowns to really end the evening right.

146
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:42,193
This is unbelievable. I leave you people alone for one hour and all hell breaks loose.

147
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:44,483
Hey, let's talk about something happy. How did your paper turn out?

148
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:46,351
- It sucked. 
- Why did it suck?

149
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:49,739
I just couldn't find the right hook. It didn't feel focused enough.

150
00:07:49,891 --> 00:07:52,066
I don't know. Professor Fleming's class is so hard.

151
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,543
Hon, I bet it was great.

152
00:07:53,693 --> 00:07:55,382
You have to say that 'cause you're my mother.

153
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:58,522
Oh, no. I'm not. I've been looking for the right time to tell you.

154
00:07:58,651 --> 00:07:59,602
Okay, I have to go now.

155
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:01,828
- Yeah, me too. Danish calls. 
- Talk to parents.

156
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,073
I'm going to take advice from you after that paper you turned in?

157
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:05,311
- Goodbye. 
- Goodbye.

158
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,882
Dude, come on... I want to do a heavenly prayer.

159
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,889
Hold on, I'm trying to do a Vulcan sting,

160
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:13,841
and I just let you do a half-moon death combo.

161
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,950
You didn't let me -- I used my soul charge.

162
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,213
Guys, the band meeting started ten minutes ago.

163
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:20,282
We can hear and play at the same time, Lane.

164
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:21,474
- What? 
- What?

165
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:24,464
Okay, fine. I'm going to decide the set list without you.

166
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:26,584
Hey, Gil, I think now would be a great time

167
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:28,908
to add a little Matchbox Twenty to our sound, don't you?

168
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:34,290
- Thank you, Lane. 
- You're welcome, Zack.

169
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,408
Okay, let's do this. The gig is Friday night.

170
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:39,184
Oh, hey, Lane. Who's taking care of the guest list? I need to put my wife down.

171
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,221
We got a sitter that night, so we are free to party.

172
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:45,277
How many people are we allowed to invite? 'Cause my aunt Susan left my uncle Sid,

173
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,776
and she's staying with my parents, and that means she's going to bring my cousin, Turner.

174
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:50,183
- I'm sure that's fine. 
- He goes everywhere dressed like Zorro.

175
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:52,159
- That still seems fine. 
- And he's 16.

176
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,284
One less wedding you're gonna have to go to, my friend.

177
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,129
You don't know that.

178
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:56,740
Here.

179
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:58,359
What's this?

180
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:01,564
It's the names of a couple chicks I met last night. Put them on the list.

181
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,084
I'm sorry -- why am I suddenly in charge of the guest list?

182
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,459
- 'Cause you're the most reliable. 
- How very rock 'n' roll.

183
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:07,304
Hey, wait.

184
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,408
- Is one of those names Dixie? 
- Yes.

185
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:10,602
Wrong night.

186
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:12,521
I want you guys to see something.

187
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:16,883
I've been working on the flier for the gig.

188
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:19,254
Why is there a sandwich on it?

189
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,892
I used a flier from the sandwich shop to get the dimensions right.

190
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:25,030
It's just a prototype. The real one won't have the sandwich on it.

191
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:27,160
So, would there be a picture of us where the sandwich is?

192
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,085
Or we could put the band name where the sandwich is.

193
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:32,028
Just the name, I think. Diagonal. Across where the sandwich is.

194
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:34,595
Everyone needs to stop saying "sandwich." I'm getting hungry.

195
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,637
Me too. Do we have anything to eat?

196
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:37,911
It was your turn to shop.

197
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,187
- Then no. 
- Great.

198
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,523
What kind of sandwich is that?

199
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:42,642
That's the meatball explosion.

200
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,686
That sounds fantastic.

201
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:47,154
I would dress up like Zorro for a meatball explosion.

202
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,227
- Why would those be connected? 
- It would be like a dare.

203
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,306
I once ate cheesecake off the floor on a dare.

204
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:52,370
Cheesecake...

205
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,573
Cheesecake would be good with the meatball explosion.

206
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:55,447
Okay, fine.

207
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:56,927
Where you going?

208
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,835
I'm going to go to the store, and I'm going to get us some food

209
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,434
so maybe we can get back to work. Okay?

210
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,673
Thanks, Mom.

211
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,452
Yeah, sure, that's exactly what I meant to do.

212
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,843
Hey, Owen, good to see you.

213
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:42,538
Ah, yes. Good to see you too, Jason.

214
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,092
You know, I was gonna call you about the changes in those contracts I sent over.

215
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:46,719
I'll call Richard about them tomorrow.

216
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:48,301
- Okay, or... 
- Goodbye, Jason.

217
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:56,028
All of the woodwork was hand-carved by a union soldier

218
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,899
that the owner, Mrs. Tinley, took pity on and nursed back to health.

219
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:04,179
He got better, went off, slaughtered a few dozen Confederate soldiers,

220
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:06,622
came back, and made the stairs.

221
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,148
Nice story, yes?

222
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:12,494
Yes, your American history is all over this inn.

223
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,804
Oh, look, a deer.

224
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,148
I think I know that little guy -- he was here for breakfast this morning.

225
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:20,645
Creep up quietly. Take a better look.

226
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:24,932
I have these people in the palm of my hand.

227
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:26,723
Travel agents are so easy.

228
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:28,591
- Are the horses washed? 
- They're washed.

229
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:31,480
Because I'm not bringing them out there to be disgusted by smelly horses.

230
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:34,243
Trust me. They've been hosed down with new-car scent. They're great.

231
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:37,147
Okay, let's see -- they saw the deer, we released the doves,

232
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:40,630
I've got the Stevens boy whitewashing the fence in short pants and a straw hat.

233
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,168
No one can manufacture a quaint, small-town moment like you, Michel.

234
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,848
Ooh, travel agents coming back.

235
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:49,221
Adorable, yes? Okay, let me show you the upstairs, the bedrooms --

236
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,297
Oh, what is that delicious scent?

237
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:56,040
Why, I bet our amazing chef, Sookie St. James,

238
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:58,689
is experimenting with her cookie recipe again.

239
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:00,454
Why don't we sneak into the kitchen

240
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,541
and see if we can convince her to give us a taste? Okay? Follow me.

241
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,954
- Coming through! 
- Coming through!

242
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:06,910
- Sookie! 
- I'm okay.

243
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:08,426
- What happened? 
- Did you make the cookies?

244
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:09,383
Is it your foot?

245
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,661
I don't think I broke it. I didn't even hear a snap this time.

246
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,102
- Oh, Sookie... 
- What about the cookies?

247
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:16,541
Ooh, the cookies are on the counter. Caramel-marshmallow-chocolate-chunk.

248
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,169
- Where are you taking her? 
- Dr. Su.

249
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,854
Ooh, great. He's the best.

250
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:23,442
Call me the minute you get there.

251
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,649
Okay. God, I love having a kitchen again.

252
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:27,251
You put the doctor on so I can talk to him?

253
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:27,984
I will.

254
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:28,920
- Hey. 
- What?

255
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:29,715
I'm back.

256
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,501
Well, this is a nice surprise.

257
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,742
Well, apparently this is a day for surprises.

258
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:42,336
Oh, what's the matter?

259
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:45,260
I spent the entire day trying to track down your father.

260
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:46,857
Do you want to sit or plant or...

261
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:48,911
I left messages at his house, on his cell phone...

262
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,835
finally, I went to the office, and he wasn't there.

263
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,028
Okay.

264
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:56,292
The only people that were there were two extremely uncomfortable looking secretaries

265
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,971
who practically threw their back out trying to avoid eye contact with me.

266
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:00,604
- Why? 
- Why? Yes. A good question.

267
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:04,213
I asked myself the same thing. And then I got a call from Richard's lawyer.

268
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:05,028
What did he want?

269
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,275
To tell me that Richard's going back into business with my father.

270
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:08,857
What? Jason...

271
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:11,966
- No, my father wouldn't do that. 
- He did it.

272
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,486
No, that company forced him out.

273
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,411
And now they have welcomed him back in.

274
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:19,888
He has his own boutique company under their banner, a big office, no overhead.

275
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:24,596
- Well, there must be some... 
- And he is taking all our clients with him.

276
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,206
I...couldn't believe it.

277
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:33,899
I thought it was one of those crazy, not-so-funny, Billy-Crystal-At-The-Oscars kind of jokes,

278
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,326
so I spent the last two hours calling every client I could,

279
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,457
and they're all gone.

280
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:40,013
Oh, Jason.

281
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:43,638
The ones I brought in from my father's company, the ones I've brought in since -- all gone.

282
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:47,227
How could he do this? How could my father just take the business from you?

283
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:51,303
Oh, no, no, no. He left me the business, but without the clients,

284
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:55,916
the business consists of some stationery, a coffee maker, and some rubber pencil grips.

285
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:56,796
I don't understand.

286
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,984
- Why would my father do that? 
- Because it's brilliant. It's perfect.

287
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:03,411
He gets my dad to drop the lawsuit, he makes some extra cash,

288
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:05,014
and he's sitting pretty. Makes perfect sense.

289
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:06,105
But he was your partner.

290
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,542
And now he's the guy running around town, bad-mouthing me.

291
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:14,163
It is amazing. Your father has done a very thorough job.

292
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:17,451
I've got nothing. He has ruined my reputation.

293
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,118
What do I do now? I don't know. Move?

294
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:23,293
- Start over somewhere else? What? 
- Well, you can't move.

295
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:26,488
Well, I have to work, and he's making it pretty impossible for me to work here.

296
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,699
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna end up in Houston. 
- Jason...

297
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:32,146
Where all the financial wash ups wash up. It's gonna be me and the Enron boys

298
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:34,849
smoking cigars while their ankle cuffs beep in the background.

299
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:36,047
What can I do?

300
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,574
Nothing. I just needed to vent. I'm okay. Thank you.

301
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:43,185
- Come in. 
- No, no. I can't. I'll call you later.

302
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,998
"I saw then what I had not seen before."

303
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:58,482
"I saw the stoop of his shoulders, the lines on his face --

304
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:01,002
like a map of a country I had once traveled with him.

305
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,107
I hoped these marks of age reflected wisdom,

306
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,387
but I feared they were merely tokens,

307
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:11,666
purchased with lack of sleep and the kind of artificial goodwill

308
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:17,515
that's squeezed from a man in the public eye like oil from a rag.

309
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:26,832
Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind.

310
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:36,942
Thank you, Asher Fleming, for that very moving excerpt from your new novel, "Jaglon."

311
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,176
It is an absolutely electric book.

312
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:43,687
Now, Professor Fleming has been kind enough to give us one hour,

313
00:15:43,755 --> 00:15:46,447
so if you'll just line up behind the table, you can get your book signed,

314
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:49,008
and then take them over to the cash register to purchase them.

315
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:50,508
If you'll just follow me.

316
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:51,137
My pleasure.

317
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:53,328
God, he was great. Wasn't he great?

318
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:54,675
He was very impressive.

319
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:58,428
He is so commanding. I mean, it's obviously not necessary for a brilliant novelist

320
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:01,557
to also be an extraordinary public speaker, but he is.

321
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,284
Yes, he is.

322
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,069
- And he's sexy as hell. 
- Teacher. Mine. Thanks.

323
00:16:05,218 --> 00:16:07,337
Look at all these girls, just flocking around him.

324
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:08,622
They're so obvious.

325
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,681
- Well, hello there. 
- Hello Professor Fleming.

326
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,865
- I can't tell you what a thrill this is. 
- Well, I'm flattered.

327
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,785
- You're a genius. 
- Am I?

328
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,049
How delightful.

329
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,609
I'm buying a copy for everyone I know.

330
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,539
Well, then, you should meet some more people.

331
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,658
You'll make my publisher's day.

332
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:29,221
Who is she kidding? Like he can't see right through the multiple-book-buying ploy?

333
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:31,560
- I mean, what girl hasn't used that one? 
- God knows, I have.

334
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:32,650
You want to go up and say hi?

335
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,334
No, thanks. You go.

336
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:36,566
We won't be disturbing him. I'm his girlfriend.

337
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:38,032
It's okay. Really.

338
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:39,910
Are you hiding from him because of your paper?

339
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,331
I'm not hiding. I just don't need to know how much it sucks before it's time.

340
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:44,671
You might be over-reacting.

341
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:46,955
Oh. No. Smell that? What's that?

342
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:49,542
Oh, yeah. I believe that's my paper. Thanks. I'll stay here.

343
00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:52,623
Oh please -- she's going to hover. Pathetic.

344
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,399
Hey, did I show you this? Look.

345
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,589
"To a wise, willful, wonderful woman."

346
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:00,894
That's me. He dedicated it to me.

347
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,700
- Wow, that's very nice. 
- I know.

348
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:05,675
It's not very specific, but it's very nice.

349
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:07,432
Well, what's he supposed to do, write my name?

350
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:08,420
Perish the thought.

351
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:09,919
- You know the situation. 
- I do.

352
00:17:10,084 --> 00:17:12,628
And as long as I know that the wise, willful, wonderful woman is me,

353
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:13,677
who cares who else knows?

354
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:16,862
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just stressed about my paper.

355
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:18,757
Well, don't take your loser paper out on me.

356
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:21,712
Is he out of water? I'm going to get him some water.

357
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,624
Paris, I'm sorry. The dedication's nice.

358
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,397
Thanks.

359
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:28,014
Oh, yes. Like they read.

360
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:34,920
Well, this was a royal waste of my time.

361
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,854
However, there were cookies. Here, hold some so I don't look like a pig.

362
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,432
You didn't enjoy the reading?

363
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:41,699
I wasn't here to enjoy the reading. I was here to cover the reading

364
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,671
for the paper to go along with the review of the book.

365
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:47,424
And then I arrive only to realize that every single available girl at Yale is here,

366
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:50,578
- including four of my reporters. 
- I'm not here on paper business.

367
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,856
I'm here because I enjoy books and because I read books.

368
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:53,505
Please.

369
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:54,472
I do.

370
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,723
- And Paris? 
- She's with me.

371
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,397
- And Anna and Cassie? 
- Point, Doyle.

372
00:17:57,521 --> 00:18:00,116
Everybody's here because Fleming's an intellectual dreamboat.

373
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:01,908
Well, I'm not here for the dreamboat.

374
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:04,615
God, that man. He's got a constant rotation going.

375
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:06,768
A new girl every year. Very young, of course.

376
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:09,891
Last year it was Trey Myers. God, was she beautiful.

377
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,527
She looked like what I always pictured a Swedish stewardess to be.

378
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:13,593
- Really? 
- Yep.

379
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:16,116
Then they broke up at the end of the term, and she rebounded with a drama major.

380
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:18,677
So, any idea who he's seeing now?

381
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,814
Actually, no. This year's girl is a bit of a mystery.

382
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:24,881
Maybe he's already broken up with one, and he's trolling for another.

383
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:27,637
My money's on the redhead.

384
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:35,968
Hi. I'm looking for my father. Big guy, bow tie.

385
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:38,040
- Mr. Gilmore's in the living room. 
- Thank you.

386
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,479
Well, you're here.

387
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,758
Lorelai. I didn't know you were coming over.

388
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:48,746
I called.

389
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,466
Yes. Well, I haven't been in the mood to talk.

390
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:52,623
Well, we need to.

391
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:53,632
I felt like reading.

392
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:55,317
Why are you doing this, Dad?

393
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:57,450
Well, reading is good for you. You learn things.

394
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:58,711
Jason was your partner.

395
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:03,020
If we are going to discuss this, let's go into my office.

396
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:05,797
Jason was your partner, and he said he was gonna take care of it.

397
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:07,512
- Lorelai... 
- Dad -- no, I'm fine talking right here.

398
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:11,106
Jason said he was taking care of everything,

399
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,968
and you didn't even give him a chance before you cut him out.

400
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:16,787
- This is business. 
- No, you took everything from him, Dad.

401
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:19,788
You're ruining his reputation. You're making it impossible for him to work.

402
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,489
I did what I had to do.

403
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:24,003
- You didn't have to do this. 
- Well, thank you for your opinion.

404
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,832
That company was so horrible to you.

405
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,190
They treated you like dirt, they forced you out, and you chose them over him?

406
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:32,811
- I am not choosing anyone over... 
- I just don't understand why you would do this.

407
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:35,673
Is it because of me? Are you taking this out on him because --

408
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:37,126
Did you not hear what the man said?

409
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:41,263
Did you not hear Floyd threaten to go after everything your mother and I have?

410
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:41,856
Yes...

411
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:44,403
Everything I've worked for. This house, our livelihood.

412
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:45,947
There has to be something else you can do.

413
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,568
- Go home, Lorelai. 
- No, Dad, please...

414
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:50,930
I'm sorry that I lied to you about dating Jason,

415
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:53,576
but you can't destroy him like this.

416
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:55,103
I'm hardly destroying him.

417
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:57,667
You took his entire business. You've left him with nothing.

418
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:59,219
He's talking about moving. Leaving.

419
00:19:59,305 --> 00:19:59,987
So what?

420
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,335
So? I'm in a relationship with him.

421
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:04,437
Then go with him.

422
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:06,644
You know I can't go with him.

423
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:09,582
I have a business, I have a house, I have Rory.

424
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,854
I can't just pick up and leave.

425
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:13,151
Well, then, you've made your choice.

426
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:15,768
- Dad, stop it. 
- I am tired of this, Lorelai.

427
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:20,006
You've shown absolutely no concern about what happens to me, what happens to your mother.

428
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:22,500
The only thing you care about is what happens to your boyfriend.

429
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:26,437
And the worst part of it... is that I never expected you to act any differently.

430
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:47,147
Is it really necessary?

431
00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:48,433
Is what really necessary?

432
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,076
Going after Jason like this.

433
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:52,048
I didn't know you were a fan of Jason's.

434
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:53,867
I'm not. I'm just concerned.

435
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:56,344
What are you concerned about, Emily?

436
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,225
It took us a long time to get Lorelai back into this house,

437
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:01,899
and she is dating Jason.

438
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:04,075
What are you saying?

439
00:21:04,224 --> 00:21:07,111
I worry that if you do this, you'll drive Lorelai away again.

440
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:09,221
And if she goes, Rory might go.

441
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:10,957
She lied to us. To you. To me.

442
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:12,836
I am very well aware of what she did.

443
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:15,510
The last time I checked, you didn't care for being lied to.

444
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,295
Don't be condescending. I don't like being lied to.

445
00:21:18,396 --> 00:21:21,351
We can't control what Lorelai will do. Rory won't go away.

446
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:23,456
I'm doing what I have to do.

447
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:35,170
Who does she think she is? Just walking out of my house like she owned the place.

448
00:21:35,257 --> 00:21:37,110
Your mom didn't just go out and get another kid.

449
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:39,404
Korea is where you go to get new kids. Ask anyone.

450
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:41,181
There has to be another explanation.

451
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:42,726
The explanation is -- I've been replaced.

452
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:44,273
You have not been replaced.

453
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:45,845
She was wearing my bunny sweater.

454
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,108
You hated that bunny sweater. That's why you left it there.

455
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,964
She also had my second-least-favorite scarf, and she was eating my apple.

456
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:52,977
What apple?

457
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,051
The apple my mother would have given me if I still lived there.

458
00:21:55,112 --> 00:21:57,436
Which you don't by your own choice, might I add.

459
00:21:57,544 --> 00:22:00,088
- Now you're taking her side. 
- I'm not taking her side.

460
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:03,943
I've been replaced. Drop by when you're in town, meet your new best friend.

461
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:04,727
Lane...

462
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,479
Tip her well when she waits on you at Luke's.

463
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,270
Head over to the church with her, share a pew.

464
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:08,987
Lane...

465
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:11,784
My mom has found a new daughter. I bet this one can needlepoint.

466
00:22:11,845 --> 00:22:14,834
Look, I've got to go. Paris said I could use ten daytime minutes on her phone,

467
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:17,194
and after that, her exorbitant prevailing rates apply,

468
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:18,781
so I'll call you back when I get to my room.

469
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,379
Oh, wait, are you coming to the gig on Friday?

470
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,075
Gig? Yes. What time do you go on?

471
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:23,556
Eight. Which means 8:30.

472
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:25,132
Shoot. Friday night dinner.

473
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:26,149
Oh, I forgot.

474
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:27,596
- I don't think I'll make it in time. 
- That's okay.

475
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:30,964
- But I want to see your gig. 
- We will have other gigs.

476
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:33,476
Of course, by that time the other Lane will be drumming in the band.

477
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:35,090
Well, as long as she's got a good downbeat.

478
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:36,421
Have you gone out for the pep squad yet?

479
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:38,121
- I'll call you in a little while. Bye. 
- Bye.

480
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:40,307
- Excuse me. 
- Oh, right.

481
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,404
A B-minus. Oh, thank god.

482
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,269
Not bad.

483
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:46,978
Are you kidding? A B-minus in Fleming's class is like...

484
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:49,144
an "A" anywhere else in sane America.

485
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:50,501
Let's celebrate.

486
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:23,992
College is loud!

487
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,122
Yes, it's part of our training.

488
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:28,508
It's right up there with the bad food, the sleep deprivation,

489
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:30,693
and how to hold your own hair while throwing up.

490
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,343
What are you doing here?

491
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,383
Inn stuff. I had to pick up hinges and doorknobs and faucets.

492
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:35,998
Oh, my.

493
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,927
And I figured, while I was in the 'hood, I'd drop this off.

494
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,049
- Hey, thanks. 
- You're welcome.

495
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:42,885
Hey, you didn't have to do that. You could have just given it to me at Friday night dinner.

496
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:43,991
I could have.

497
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:45,853
Friday night dinner.

498
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:47,631
You're not going to Friday night dinner.

499
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:48,516
- Rory.
- Why?

500
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:49,680
Things have gotten worse.

501
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:52,392
How could they be worse? They were already at worse.

502
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:56,477
Dad is going after Jason, and...it's complicated but it's really bad.

503
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:59,068
And I went over there to try to talk to him about it, and he was horrible.

504
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,173
-He said awful things to me. 
- Like what?

505
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:03,370
Like things. It doesn't matter, but

506
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:08,059
I can't just go and sit there and make small talk and pretend that everything's okay.

507
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:09,447
- Mom... 
- Because it's not okay.

508
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:11,480
You were mad, he was mad, you said some things...

509
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,381
No, Rory.

510
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:15,618
No. Now, I don't doubt that it was bad. You and Grandpa can make each other crazy,

511
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,849
but maybe once he calmed down, he was sorry.

512
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:20,133
- He is not sorry. 
- You could be wrong.

513
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:23,245
Maybe if we go over there and give him a chance to make it right, he would.

514
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:25,755
Oh, boy, honey, you're living in fuzzy-puppy land.

515
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:28,360
Mom, it's really important to me that you don't back out of Friday night dinners.

516
00:24:28,422 --> 00:24:30,268
They're the only time that the whole family gets together.

517
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:34,791
Sometimes it's the only time that I get to see you, and I like having it there.

518
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:36,927
- It's really important to me. 
- Rory, come on.

519
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:40,587
I'm serious. Please, just give him a chance to make it up to you.

520
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:42,738
Please. I'll be there. I'll be your buffer.

521
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:44,970
- You will, huh? 
- Absolutely.

522
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:47,428
They can focus on me, you can focus on me...

523
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,824
What about when he throws his glass of water in my face?

524
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,888
- Then I will get very wet. 
- I'm holding you to that.

525
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:58,517
Caesar, I need a turkey burger, fries well-done,

526
00:24:58,574 --> 00:25:00,668
and I'm still waiting for that grilled cheese and tomato.

527
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:01,861
Patience is a virtue.

528
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:05,680
Light a candle, and tell it to the pope. I want my grilled cheese, pronto.

529
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:07,862
- Excuse me, Lane? 
- Yes, Kirk.

530
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:10,136
- I'm a little confused. 
- About what, Kirk?

531
00:25:10,182 --> 00:25:12,060
Well, I'm looking at this flier you gave me,

532
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:15,122
and what exactly do you have to do to get the sandwich?

533
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:15,788
What?

534
00:25:15,895 --> 00:25:17,754
I mean, does everyone who shows up get a sandwich,

535
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,561
or is it first come, first sandwich?

536
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:22,648
Oh, that's a mistake. The sandwich isn't supposed to be there.

537
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:23,417
What are you saying?

538
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:26,423
I'm saying that's just a flier for our band. We're playing Friday at 8:30.

539
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:28,409
- So, there's no sandwiches. 
- No.

540
00:25:28,547 --> 00:25:30,719
- Then, why would I go? 
- To hear some great music.

541
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,324
Oh. Can I bring my own sandwich?

542
00:25:33,524 --> 00:25:34,497
Hey, Lane?

543
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,857
I know it's time for your break now, but is it okay if I let Caesar take his?

544
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,153
He owes me a grilled cheese.

545
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:43,184
I'll do it. He's gotta run to the bank or something.

546
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:46,248
To be honest, I wasn't paying too much attention, 'cause he was bugging me.

547
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:47,235
- No problem. 
- Thanks.

548
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:55,104
I'm taking my 10!

549
00:25:59,502 --> 00:26:00,936
That looks like it travels well.

550
00:26:03,818 --> 00:26:04,915
- Who are you? 
- Hi.

551
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:05,933
- What are you doing here? 
- Where?

552
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:07,537
- Why are you living in my house? 
- Your house?

553
00:26:07,592 --> 00:26:09,995
- That house right there. It's mine. 
- I'm staying there.

554
00:26:10,072 --> 00:26:12,446
- Why? Are we related? 
- I hope not.

555
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:15,062
- How do you know Mrs. Kim? 
- I am exchange student from Seoul.

556
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,745
I'm here for three months, and Mrs. Kim is my host.

557
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:20,091
- Exchange student, huh? 
- Yes. Who are you?

558
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:22,431
I'm Mrs. Kim's daughter. She did tell you she had a daughter, right?

559
00:26:22,532 --> 00:26:24,638
- Yes. 
- Well, she does, and it's me.

560
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:27,003
So, you can try whatever tricks you want. I will always be her daughter.

561
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:29,485
- Why are you so mad? 
- Because you stole my life.

562
00:26:29,532 --> 00:26:31,569
- I did not steal your life. 
- You're living in my room.

563
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,797
You're wearing my clothes. And don't tell me you always looked like that.

564
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:36,296
I'm not very crazy!

565
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:39,905
How would you like it if I moved into your house?!

566
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,948
Why don't you just go back home?!

567
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,853
You don't have to feel sorry for Mrs. Kim! Mrs. Kim is fine!

568
00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:49,818
And give me back my sweater, and my second-least-favorite scarf!

569
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:55,075
On Tuesday, we'll continue our look at "Neglect of the Individual"

570
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:57,067
as a hallmark of modern government.

571
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:00,498
Be prepared to discuss Kafka's "The Trial."

572
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:04,498
Yes, if all goes well, it'll get very ugly.

573
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:06,472
Thank you, everyone.

574
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,483
Oh, very nice job on your paper, Miss Gilmore.

575
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:16,971
Oh, thank you.

576
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:23,441
You know, Professor Fleming, I was actually a little surprised by my grade.

577
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,730
Were you? Well, you deserved it.

578
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:27,214
You did good work.

579
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:29,735
To be honest, I don't feel like I did.

580
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,054
Ah, a perfectionist.

581
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:35,831
No, I'm not a perfectionist. I just know when I do well and when I don't.

582
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,366
You know, this sounds as if you're questioning your grade.

583
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:40,415
Well, maybe I am.

584
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,848
Well, this is a first.

585
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:49,327
Today alone, I've heard complaints from, uh... two "D"s, four "C"s, and an "F,"

586
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:51,469
but, uh, not from an "A."

587
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:56,906
In fact, in 35 years of teaching, I've never heard from an "A."

588
00:27:57,084 --> 00:28:00,946
I just want to be sure that the grade I got is... what I deserve.

589
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,022
What exactly are you saying, Miss Gilmore?

590
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:07,857
Just that if the grade I got wasn't... legitimately earned, then I have no interest in it.

591
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,218
Oh, how very noble of you.

592
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,946
I intend to earn all of my grades. I don't want any favors.

593
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:17,099
And why exactly would you think that I'd be inclined to grant you any favors?

594
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:18,886
- I'm not saying that you are... 
- You're not?

595
00:28:19,046 --> 00:28:21,481
Oh, then I must have misunderstood this conversation.

596
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,376
- I'm just saying that... 
- Yes?

597
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:26,448
That I want to earn all of my grades.

598
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:28,430
Yes, you've already said that.

599
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:32,295
No matter how many "wise, willful, and wonderful women" I know.

600
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:36,472
Have you quite finished?

601
00:28:37,697 --> 00:28:38,700
I suppose I am.

602
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,131
Oh, before you go any further, Miss Gilmore, let me assure you

603
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,886
that I do not give grades that are not earned.

604
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:48,425
I gave you an "A" because your argument was well-structured,

605
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:50,850
your writing was clear and concise,

606
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:55,289
and you drew a connection from Marsilius of Padua to Machiavelli

607
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:59,999
to the modern age of media that PhD candidates would envy.

608
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:04,869
In fact, no one else's paper was that thoroughly researched.

609
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:07,853
Except for the other person who also got an "A."

610
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:10,987
You did what was demanded, and you did it well.

611
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:15,882
And I would seriously caution you not to question my grading tactics again.

612
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:17,221
Okay.

613
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:19,139
Thanks for the "A."

614
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:22,298
And the redhead has fat thighs

615
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:27,372
Come on.

616
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,383
Hey, hey, there's no hurry. We're early.

617
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:32,256
Yes, but we're here, so we might as well go in and get it over with.

618
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:34,207
Okay, just relax, why don't you?

619
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,022
I would like to stop and smell the roses if you don't mind.

620
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,663
Mom...

621
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:39,348
You're young. You don't understand these things.

622
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:42,487
I'm old, I'm dying, I'm gonna smell a rose. Oh, I don't see a rose.

623
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:44,838
- I think there's one next door. 
- You're being a tad ridiculous. Come on.

624
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:48,727
On a scale of one to a million, how awful do you think tonight's gonna be?

625
00:29:48,796 --> 00:29:51,344
Well, how high a number did you think the walk up the driveway was?

626
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:57,182
You know, I wonder which tact my dad's gonna pick tonight.

627
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:58,655
I bet he goes with the silent treatment.

628
00:29:58,722 --> 00:30:00,191
Or maybe...he won't.

629
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:03,068
Yeah, you're right. He might prefer the full-on, frontal assault.

630
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:07,595
You know, just constant mental flogging right from "dingdong" through till "drive safe."

631
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:08,798
Well, at least he said "drive safe."

632
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:10,494
Oh, no. It wasn't him. It was the maid.

633
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:11,265
Right.

634
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,076
Or maybe Dad will be fine, and Emily will be on the attack.

635
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:16,924
Yeah, a little good cop/bad cop if you know what I mean.

636
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,716
Keep me on my toes. I won't be expecting that.

637
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:20,012
Except that you are. Ready?

638
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:23,113
Okay -- wait, just wait -- we can still leave.

639
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,888
No.

640
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:25,863
Rory... right now is the point in the horror movie

641
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,742
where the entire audience is yelling, "Don't go in there."

642
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,585
I will be right beside you, okay?

643
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:34,347
Okay. But I'm telling you... if my dad gets ugly, I'm out of there.

644
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:44,203
Lorelai. Rory. You're early.

645
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:45,254
Yeah, no traffic.

646
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:45,979
No?

647
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:50,101
Well, that's very... Come in.

648
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:54,940
Did you hit much traffic?

649
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:57,904
Um...no. No traffic at all.

650
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:03,848
Well, good. Nothing like an hour stuck in traffic to ruin your complete day.

651
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:06,690
Should I take your coats?

652
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:08,048
That's okay. We can just put them here.

653
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:09,183
All right.

654
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:12,731
Well, you're early, so I'm not quite organized yet, but...

655
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,138
- shall we have some drinks? 
- Okay.

656
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:16,341
All right.

657
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,081
There's no ice. Do we need ice?

658
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,498
Of course we need ice.

659
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:24,509
There's some in the kitchen. I'll go get it.

660
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:25,497
Okay.

661
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:27,308
He doesn't seem mad.

662
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:29,470
All depends on which definition of "mad" you're going with.

663
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,147
Mom...

664
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:34,374
Lorelai. Rory. You're early.

665
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:36,811
Yeah, we didn't hit any traffic, so...

666
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:38,676
Well, it's nice to see you.

667
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:39,755
Where were you?

668
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:41,445
- When? 
- Just now.

669
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,693
Oh, well, I had to run out to the store.

670
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,834
To get what?

671
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,207
They were out.

672
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:48,264
Emily... the girls are early.

673
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:50,175
I see that. Is that ice?

674
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:52,770
Yes. We need it to make the drinks.

675
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,101
Oh, shoot.

676
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:58,756
You should take the bucket into the kitchen the next time.

677
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:00,968
Yes, that would've been the smart thing to do.

678
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:03,395
Well, I was making drinks.

679
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,511
So, Rory, how is school?

680
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:10,859
It's fine. I just got an "A" on a paper.

681
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,462
Oh, well, that's wonderful.

682
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,795
You gonna let go of that purse, Mom?

683
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:14,377
What?

684
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,072
Well, you're holding pretty tightly to your purse there.

685
00:32:16,123 --> 00:32:17,614
You look like someone's Tante Flickman.

686
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:21,135
Oh, well, I just...there.

687
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:22,195
- Okay. 
- It's new.

688
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,360
- The purse? 
- Yes, it's new. I'm trying to break it in.

689
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,725
Sure. Otherwise, you'd get blisters.

690
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:29,502
Well, here we are.

691
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:31,960
- Lorelai. 
- Thank you.

692
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,209
And soda for Rory.

693
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:34,868
Emily?

694
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:38,119
Well, good.

695
00:32:38,568 --> 00:32:41,166
Uh, so...Cheers.

696
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,153
- Cheers. 
- Cheers.

697
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,060
So, Rory, how's school?

698
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,891
Fine. I just got an "A" on a... paper.

699
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:50,546
Has she told you about the traffic?

700
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:51,456
Dinner's ready.

701
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:52,772
It is?

702
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:55,296
It's only just 7:00 now.

703
00:32:55,425 --> 00:32:58,639
Oh, I'm sorry. What time did you want dinner? You didn't tell me, so...

704
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:01,133
You know what? It's all right. We'll just eat now.

705
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:02,725
- Now? 
- Okay.

706
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:05,060
- But what do we do with our... 
- Just take your drinks to the table.

707
00:33:05,224 --> 00:33:08,270
- Take our drinks to the...
- Oh, I'll grab the cocktail napkins.

708
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:10,364
But... Mom, you left your purse.

709
00:33:10,565 --> 00:33:12,054
Oh, yes.

710
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:12,571
Mom.

711
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:14,537
- What? 
- I was just kidding, Mom.

712
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:16,232
Oh, you.

713
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:20,293
Okay, so every time they ask you about school or traffic, just do a shot.

714
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:39,364
Thank you.

715
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,494
So, what's for dessert?

716
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,096
We're not having dessert.

717
00:33:56,665 --> 00:33:58,390
- We're not? 
- I'm on a diet.

718
00:33:58,477 --> 00:34:00,069
Americans are extremely fat.

719
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:01,535
I think they prefer Rubenesque.

720
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,620
You're not fat, Grandma.

721
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:03,992
Well, thank you, Lorelai.

722
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:07,177
She was close.

723
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:15,853
Well, okay. If we're not having dessert, then we should go?

724
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:17,535
- All right. 
- See you next Friday

725
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,428
- Thank you for coming. 
- Oh. Thank you for having us.

726
00:34:20,729 --> 00:34:24,247
Oh, wait. The Gordons' gave us some wonderful chocolate last week.

727
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,572
They brought it back from Belgium. You can take it with you.

728
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:28,134
No, Mom, that's okay. We're fine.

729
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:30,437
These are really good chocolates, Lorelai.

730
00:34:30,555 --> 00:34:31,486
I'm sure they are, Dad.

731
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:33,714
- Did you find them, Emily? 
- Grandpa, we can just get them next time.

732
00:34:33,802 --> 00:34:36,454
Oh, nonsense. You can eat them on the way home. Emily?

733
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:39,238
Here they are. I've got them.

734
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,825
One for you and one for you. Enjoy.

735
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:42,859
We will.

736
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,712
Okay... we're leaving now. Have a good evening and get some sleep.

737
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:49,429
All right.

738
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:52,723
Good night.

739
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:57,563
- What the hell was that? 
- I don't know.

740
00:34:57,732 --> 00:35:00,626
Jack Nicholson and Angelina Jolie just kicked us out with parting gifts.

741
00:35:00,692 --> 00:35:01,669
Dessert to go.

742
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,250
As much as the thought of an early end to Friday night dinner

743
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,478
and dessert for the road appeals to me, that was just weird.

744
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:08,448
- She made a tin-foil swan. 
- What was up with the drinks

745
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:10,895
and the dinner she knew nothing about, and where was she coming from, anyhow?

746
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:11,515
I don't know.

747
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:13,713
- She had to "run to the store." Since when? 
- I don't know.

748
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:16,553
And she came back with nothing. Ooh, and the purse. Did you notice the purse?

749
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:20,133
They say people change as they get older. I just didn't think it was all in one week.

750
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:21,309
There is something wrong here.

751
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,035
Why is my mother's car here?

752
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:24,126
She was in a hurry?

753
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:26,860
My mother never parks her car in the driveway,

754
00:35:26,906 --> 00:35:30,075
because the car might drip oil and make a spot on the concrete,

755
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:31,376
and then life as we know it would end.

756
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:32,773
What are you doing?

757
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,764
- Just seeing what's in her car. 
- Why?

758
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:37,392
Because -- I don't know. I just feel like something's up.

759
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:40,803
- She's coming. 
- Who?

760
00:35:40,863 --> 00:35:41,842
Mom. Hurry.

761
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,775
What are you doing? Good shoes, good shoes, good shoes.

762
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,754
- She's leaving. Where's she going? 
- I don't know.

763
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:04,932
She left her house with dry cleaning, and she drove off?

764
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:05,956
She was meeting friends?

765
00:36:06,157 --> 00:36:07,698
- Tonight? After dinner? 
- Maybe?

766
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,349
I'm sorry. This might be crazy, but...

767
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,680
is my mom not staying here tonight?

768
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:17,953
Well...

769
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:14,053
Great gig! Awesome gig!

770
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,958
You're starting to wheeze on the beat, dude.

771
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:17,013
I've been practicing.

772
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:19,603
Man, I am feeling it. We have hit the next level.

773
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,411
- We have, haven't we? 
- You heard the crowd.

774
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,060
Dude, what was with the shirt raise?

775
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:25,692
Hey, man, when I'm playing like that, there is no room for clothes.

776
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,558
We need a sign, 'cause I was staring right at you when you took it off.

777
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,833
- I felt like putting a buck in your pants. 
- Hey, I wouldn't turn it down.

778
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,175
Brian, honey!

779
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:33,715
Hey, Mom.

780
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,899
- You kids were excellent. 
- Thanks, Dad.

781
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,259
- Hey, Aunt Susan. Hey...Turner. 
- Hey, Brian.

782
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:43,724
- I brought carrot sticks. You want a carrot stick, Brian? 
- Yeah, thanks.

783
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:47,109
- He really does wear a Zorro costume. 
- I gotta go find my wife.

784
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:51,973
I'm so jazzed right now. That was great! We have never played that good.

785
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:54,189
- You've never played that good. 
- Really?

786
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,165
You've never given me a compliment, ever.

787
00:37:57,252 --> 00:37:58,306
What am I, your mother?

788
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:01,685
What?

789
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,543
- Who is that? 
- I think it's his wife.

790
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:05,987
Seriously, that is just wrong.

791
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:08,240
He should celebrate. We all should celebrate.

792
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:11,726
Stay out all night, hit the clubs, and talk about our Rolling Stones cover --

793
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:13,799
"Garden of Eden" theme.

794
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:14,609
Hi, Zack.

795
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,445
- Shannon. 
- You remembered?

796
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:19,053
I can read a napkin, sweetheart.

797
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:22,293
- Nice pants. 
- You're a god.

798
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,557
And we shall discuss this further at the bar.

799
00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:29,056
So, what did you think of the lyrics?

800
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:22,970
So, I spent all morning on the phone calling every hotel in the area

801
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,389
with a decent high tea, and there she was.

802
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:28,329
Grafton Hotel, room 421.

803
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:30,418
- Check-out date indefinite. 
- I'm sorry.

804
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:34,273
I can't believe my parents are separated.

805
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:36,930
I mean, I dreamed about this as a kid.

806
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:41,927
Of course, my scenario also involved my mother finding her inner Timothy Leary

807
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,041
and moving us all out to a commune in Berkeley, but still...

808
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:48,769
I was convinced that these people should not be together, but you know what?

809
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:51,348
I was wrong. Richard and Emily Gilmore were made for each other.

810
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:53,770
God, this is so...freaky.

811
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:57,467
And I'm not supposed to know, and of course we won't talk about it,

812
00:40:57,513 --> 00:41:00,212
because we don't do that in our family. We repress everything,

813
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:03,268
and we refuse to go to therapy, because why tell a stranger your problems,

814
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,905
when you can use them to punish those around you?

815
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:07,651
So, what now?

816
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:12,628
Every Friday I'm supposed to pretend that they still live together,

817
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:17,650
and then after we leave, my mother will get in her car and drive back to the hotel?

818
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:21,557
The hotel. My mother's living in a hotel. It's weird. It's just incredibly weird.

819
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:24,881
I'm sorry. I just needed to vent.

820
00:41:26,078 --> 00:41:26,959
 You have every right.

821
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:29,610
I'm done now. There's nothing I can do about them, so...

822
00:41:31,651 --> 00:41:33,726
Talk to me. You were gonna tell me something.

823
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:35,396
I'm suing your father.

824
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:38,991
I have to, Lorelai.

825
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:41,956
No, you don't.

826
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:45,857
I've gone over it. I've weighed every option. I have to respond.

827
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:50,327
I cannot just sit here and do nothing when my entire career is going up in flames.

828
00:41:50,393 --> 00:41:52,143
Jason, please. Don't do this.

829
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,213
Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe he'll settle.

830
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:55,145
He won't settle.

831
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:57,060
It's just business.

832
00:41:57,617 --> 00:41:59,758
Oh, my God. I'm so sick of hearing people say that.

833
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,210
You know I wouldn't do this if I didn't have to.

834
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:03,281
You don't have to.

835
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:07,464
If I intend to continue working in my chosen profession, then, yeah, I have to.

836
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:09,369
Don't be just a business guy.

837
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:11,577
Put this on another level. Please.

838
00:42:11,985 --> 00:42:12,630
I can't.

839
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:13,637
Unbelievable.

840
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:15,067
Lorelai... I have no choice.

841
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:17,586
- I have to fight back. 
- Jason...

842
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,752
I will keep you out of this. I promise.

843
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,349
I can't be with someone who's suing my family.

844
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:26,228
- Lorelai, come on. 
- I'm sorry.

845
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:30,437
- You saw what your father did to me. 
- I know what he did to you.

846
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:32,572
And he is not gonna stop until there's nothing left.

847
00:42:32,644 --> 00:42:34,375
I'm asking you not to do this.

848
00:42:34,456 --> 00:42:36,028
Ask me something else. Anything else.

849
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:37,564
This is what I want.

850
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,124
You know how hard I work. My job is who I am.

851
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,167
I can't lose everything. You have to understand why I'm doing this.

852
00:42:43,283 --> 00:42:44,226
I do understand.

853
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:48,256
But I can't be with someone who's suing my family.

854
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,827
Lorelai...
