1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:02,988
Oh, sure. Thanks.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,584
Come in.

3
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:19,467
Hi! Hello. I'm sorry, do I have the wrong room?

4
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:20,199
I wouldn't know.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,551
How delightful to have all of my towels used and then deposited in my hamper

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,280
with my dry clothes to create a pungent musty combo.

7
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:27,346
Hey, Lorelai.

8
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:28,656
Paris, good, I have the right room.

9
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:29,793
This is Rory's mother.

10
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:31,272
Hi. Lorelai.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,070
I'm Doyle, Rory's editor.

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,920
And my lover.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,110
Okay, well, super.

14
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:37,447
I don't think lover is exactly the correct term, Paris.

15
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:39,624
Really? What is the correct term, Doyle?

16
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:40,766
At a later time, Paris.

17
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:44,094
Doyle and I haven't defined the social aspects of our relationship yet.

18
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:46,393
Although we're having sex three or four times a week,

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,890
so apparently the sexual aspects of our relationship are crystal freaking clear.

20
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:50,817
Paris, I beg you.

21
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:52,639
Is Rory here? 'Cause I could wait outside, or -

22
00:00:52,706 --> 00:00:53,556
I'm making you uncomfortable.

23
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:54,954
- Yes.
- Her. Not you.

24
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:56,561
No, I'm fine. You two should be alone.

25
00:00:56,627 --> 00:01:00,494
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't be talking about love, or sex, especially since you -

26
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:01,666
Since I -

27
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:02,521
Don't have any.

28
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:03,551
Rory! Are you here?

29
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:04,574
Yeah, I'm just getting my coat!

30
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:06,033
Ah! Can I watch?

31
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:07,103
Oh, is Paris out there?

32
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,538
- She sure is.
- Come on in.

33
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:10,674
- Nice meeting you, Doyle.
- Nice to meet you, too.

34
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:14,544
Yes?

35
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:16,566
You look so hot when you find me annoying.

36
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:19,151
Then I must be Gisele Bï¿½ndchen to you 24/7.

37
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:22,956
Sorry, I thought she and Doyle were indisposed.

38
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:24,871
No, no, plenty of disposal going on.

39
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:27,021
So I notice you told Paris about my breakup.

40
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:29,340
Ah. I'm sorry, I didn't tell her on purpose.

41
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:31,266
It's very difficult to keep anything from Paris.

42
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:34,176
It's very close proximity and I swear she has a dog's ears.

43
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:34,984
That's fine.

44
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,781
I didn't mean to blab.

45
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:38,045
I know. But, hey, don't worry about me.

46
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,037
Things are starting to look up. They think I'm a student.

47
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:43,288
And they also think you're Polynesian and potentially sexually undecided.

48
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:44,773
Yeah. Well, still an improvement.

49
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:45,782
Okay. Ready.

50
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:47,114
This was a good idea, having dinner.

51
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,137
Well, it is Friday night.

52
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah, but Friday night dinner without Ava and Adolf. Lovely.

53
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,021
It's really not fair calling Grandpa Adolf!

54
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:53,929
No, no, that was Grandma.

55
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,435
We're going.

56
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,006
Rory, are these your chips?

57
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:00,766
Yes, Doyle.

58
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:01,583
Can I have some?

59
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:02,679
Knock yourself out, Doyle.

60
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:06,063
Listen, Lorelai? If you decide that your breakup is something that you want to talk about,

61
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:06,869
please let me know.

62
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:07,661
Okay, Paris.

63
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:09,827
And let me know before Tuesday, because I'm doing a paper

64
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:11,220
for my Emotional Mental Health class

65
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,324
about how women of a certain age cope with loneliness,

66
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,119
and I think you'd be a great lead-off antidote.

67
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,379
You can't take her. She's trained in Krav Maga.

68
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,175
Damn it.

69
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,846
Okay, so where do the cool kids sit?

70
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:20,001
This is Yale. There are no cool tables.

71
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:21,946
Oh, come on. Point out the cliques.

72
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:24,665
The geeks. The stoners. The Plastics. Give me the scoop.

73
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:27,951
The scoop is that this is Yale. There are no cliques, we are beyond cliques.

74
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:30,712
So you get to college, and everybody just loves each other?

75
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:31,525
Yes.

76
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:32,939
It's Haight Ashbury all over again.

77
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,644
- Except the tie-dye is done by Prada.
- Okay.

78
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:35,729
Hey, not that one.

79
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:37,957
See, that was the clique table.

80
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,427
No, it's under an air vent.

81
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:41,899
Seriously, Grandma, buy a shawl.

82
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:45,488
Hey, one good cold can set you back a month in studying.

83
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:47,972
Mmm. See, in my mind, I heard 'partying', but okay.

84
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:50,951
Here's to our very own special Friday night dinner.

85
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,779
Hear, hear. This stuff looks pretty good.

86
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:55,125
It is. So what's going on at home?

87
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,664
Oh! Big grapefruit shortage.

88
00:03:57,747 --> 00:04:00,455
The hurricanes wiped them out and Taylor is completely freaking out.

89
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,177
I'm sure.

90
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:05,105
And Patty and Babette are organizing Stars Hollow's first botox party.

91
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,328
Are you invited?

92
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,844
Are you insinuating I should be?

93
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:09,243
So the Hollow's low on grapefruits.

94
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:14,132
And I'm doing costumes for the Stars Hollow Elementary School production of Fiddler on the Roof.

95
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:16,324
So, how are you doing?

96
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,192
I'm doing fine.

97
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,005
How are you doing?

98
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,467
I'm doing fine. I swear. I'm getting better.

99
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:24,028
No word from Luke?

100
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,523
Not waiting on word from Luke.

101
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:27,270
Okay.

102
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,616
Anyhow, I'm fine.

103
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:34,336
I mean, not that I'm over it, but little by little it's getting easier to pretend it's easier,

104
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,216
which means easier must be right around the corner.

105
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:37,275
I'm sure it is.

106
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:39,656
And I'm working on getting down a new routine.

107
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,539
I've settled on Weston's in the morning.

108
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,389
Decent coffee, excellent strudel.

109
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,195
Yeah. So, that's me.

110
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:46,061
How are you?

111
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,470
Hmm, well, I study, then study, then after a little study break, I study.

112
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:53,015
How's, um, Logan?

113
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,955
He's been out of town for a while so I haven't seen him.

114
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:56,599
Hmm. And what else?

115
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:00,581
What?

116
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:02,497
I got an e-mail from Dad.

117
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:04,521
Oh, you did?

118
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,194
Huh. When?

119
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:07,207
Monday.

120
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:10,306
Only two weeks after the fact. Very speedy.

121
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:11,837
I'm sure he was just nervous.

122
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:13,828
You know, you don't need to hide that from me.

123
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,911
Well, I wasn't sure if you wanted to hear about it, or hear Dad's name -

124
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,829
Hey, it's part of the whole 'moving on' thing, right? So what did he say?

125
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:21,620
He wanted to give me his side of the story.

126
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:27,331
Oh, well. Unless his side of the story includes having his long-lost evil twin lock him in the closet

127
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:30,540
and come to the wedding in his place, his side of the story doesn't exist.

128
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,015
He said it was all a misunderstanding.

129
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:32,559
What?

130
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,911
He said the only reason he came was to celebrate Grandma and Grandpa's vow renewal.

131
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:37,489
And 'cause Adolf told him to.

132
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:38,625
He says he likes Luke.

133
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:39,840
Yeah, he's proven that.

134
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,064
He just wants you to be happy.

135
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,066
So, he got me dumped.

136
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:45,026
And, basically that the whole thing was just a misunderstanding.

137
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,128
You know, the more he defends himself, the more he needs to defend himself.

138
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,387
Hey, do you think Grandpa knew about it?

139
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:51,565
About Christopher coming?

140
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,510
Do you think he planned it with Grandma?

141
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:58,031
Look how panicked you are. No, honey, honestly, the whole thing reeks of Emily.

142
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,494
I mean, not that I think he would have discouraged it,

143
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:03,336
but I'm pretty sure she's the one who poisoned the apple

144
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,230
and gave it to Dopey to bring to the party.

145
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,040
Yeah.

146
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,210
Oh my God.

147
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:09,756
- Never again.
- Never, never again.

148
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:13,039
See, we are at the cool table.

149
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,018
I'm telling you, if she throws up you're golden.

150
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,821
You are so not starving here at Yale.

151
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:19,028
My lips are frozen.

152
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:23,935
Look, while it might seem a little eccentric to eat ice cream in forty degree weather -

153
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:24,722
You'd think!

154
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,541
There are several advantages to the concept.

155
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:30,498
For example, since it's cold out, the ice cream won't melt, therefore it'll last longer.

156
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:33,095
So then my lips will stay frozen for double the amount of time.

157
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:35,880
Okay, I lost the feeling in my tongue!

158
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,570
I'm throwing the ice cream out now.

159
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:38,951
Oh, my God, it's frozen.

160
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,178
It's like an ice cube. A tongue-shaped ice cube and it'll never thaw.

161
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:45,050
Then why don't you shut your mouth? Let the heat stay inside?

162
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,311
That was hostile.

163
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:48,344
And useful. Thank you.

164
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:50,232
Hey, isn't that your naked guy?

165
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:53,618
Oh, yeah. Marty, hey! He's not my naked guy.

166
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,472
Well, you don't really want a communal naked guy, nowadays, you know, it's too sketchy.

167
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:03,259
Huh. Well, I guess he didn't hear about you sitting at the cool table.

168
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:03,960
Yeah.

169
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:05,787
You guys rumbling?

170
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,902
No, we're just not as close lately.

171
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,603
Aw, that's too bad. He seems like a nice guy.

172
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:10,463
Yeah, he is.

173
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,915
All right, honey. Thank you for dinner.

174
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:14,057
You're leaving?

175
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:15,425
Yeah, I should get back.

176
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,450
Okay. You can come in and watch T.V. for a while if you want.

177
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,289
It's okay.

178
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:22,112
You can even stay over if you don't feel like driving back.

179
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:23,428
Are there monsters under your bed again?

180
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:24,457
I'm just saying.

181
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,022
Look, Miss Nightingale. I appreciate your concern.

182
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:30,488
And the offer to spend the night is much nicer than the suggestion

183
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:31,870
that I shut my mouth, but I'm fine.

184
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:32,618
You sure?

185
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:33,908
Big girl.

186
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,348
Yeah. It's still new.

187
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,113
Angel, I have been dumped before.

188
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,194
Not by Luke.

189
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,857
No, not by Luke. But a dump is a dump.

190
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,396
The process is still the same.

191
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,368
- Don't worry, Mom's cool.
- I know Mom's cool.

192
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,052
- 'Cause you heard about the table?
- Exactly.

193
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,060
- All right, kid, I'll see you later.
- Okay, bye.

194
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:56,985
Wow, looks good.

195
00:07:57,354 --> 00:07:59,274
Hey, Iï¿½m Lorelai, Iï¿½ll be here every morning.

196
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:01,553
ï¿½Kay, see you guys tomorrow.

197
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:02,756
Here we go.

198
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:04,462
Three coffees.

199
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:06,540
Oh, no, Iï¿½m sorry. I only ordered one.

200
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,250
You said Coffee, coffee, coffeeï¿½..

201
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:11,144
Haha, no, see, I said coffee-coffee-coffeeï¿½..

202
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,721
Right.

203
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:13,867
As in I really need coffee-coffee-coffee.

204
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:15,669
- You know.
- No.

205
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,511
Coffee-coffee-coffee is a saying, like an exaggeration.

206
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:21,680
Itï¿½s a funny, desperate cry for caffeine.

207
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:22,734
Itï¿½s just my thing.

208
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:26,643
ï¿½Cause everybody knows I drink a lot of coffee, so the day canï¿½t start until Iï¿½ve had my jolt.

209
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,379
Itï¿½s a bit. My bit.

210
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:32,073
Itï¿½s not a particularly funny bit unless you know me, then ï¿½

211
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:34,517
you know what, three coffees would be great. What do I owe you?

212
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:53,437
I donï¿½t know what other words I should use.

213
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:54,915
Perhaps I should talk slower,

214
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:58,234
or have a woman sit in a circle above my head signing my words to you.

215
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,159
That would be fresher than you yelling at us.

216
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:00,698
Glenn.

217
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:03,400
Sorry. But every time I hear you I hear my mother.

218
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,742
See my mother -

219
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:05,863
Stop comparing me to your mother.

220
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,215
Stop acting like her.

221
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:08,669
Anyhow, as I was saying ï¿½

222
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:09,781
Pick up your socks!

223
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,392
Hey! Our editorï¿½s talking!

224
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:12,417
Heï¿½s your boyfriend, not mine.

225
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,921
That has yet to be determined.

226
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,515
Youï¿½re particularly sassy today.

227
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,671
I know. It must be my new glasses prescription.

228
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:21,535
I need all of you to hand in a hard copy of your stories in addition to filing them electronically.

229
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:24,563
Last week our mail server was down and we very nearly missed our deadline.

230
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:25,843
- Now how would that have looked?
- Blank.

231
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,645
- Glenn!
- Sorry. Mom.

232
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:29,856
New system starts today.

233
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:33,875
I want all articles in hard copy on my desk ï¿½ where are you going?

234
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:34,875
Iï¿½ll be right back.

235
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:35,913
Iï¿½m talking!

236
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,470
And very well, might I add.

237
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:38,130
Gilmore!

238
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:39,461
Doyle, I could be back by now!

239
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,480
Now thatï¿½s a manly sized cup of coffee.

240
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,453
Uh, yeah. I, uh, I worked late,

241
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:51,126
and I had a paper and I didnï¿½t get a lot of sleep ï¿½

242
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:53,937
Marty, you never have to apologize for a huge cup of coffee to me.

243
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:55,180
Right. I know.

244
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,050
So youï¿½ve been pretty busy lately, huh?

245
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:57,870
Uh, yes.

246
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,114
- Working a lot?
- Yes.

247
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,107
- Studying a lot?
- Yes.

248
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:01,626
So thatï¿½s probably why I havenï¿½t seen you very much.

249
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,488
Yes. Probably.

250
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:03,932
I missed you. A lot.

251
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,201
Well, Iï¿½m sure youï¿½ve been a little busy yourself.

252
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,251
I guess.

253
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,285
Hey listen, are you working this weekend?

254
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:12,222
Uh, no.

255
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:15,867
Great, because I was thinking. Itï¿½s been ages since weï¿½ve had a good hangout night.

256
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:16,902
Oh, well ï¿½

257
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:18,587
We could watch DVDï¿½s, order food.

258
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:22,200
Oh, I just got the new Marx Brothers box set. You love the Marx Brothers, Duck Soup!

259
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:23,327
I donï¿½t know if I can ï¿½

260
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:24,853
Did you hear me? I just said Duck Soup.

261
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:25,453
Rory ï¿½

262
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,449
We could watch them all. You know, start early.

263
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:30,030
Make a major marathon thing out of it. Just us.

264
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:32,035
We havenï¿½t done this in a long time. Please?

265
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:34,858
Okay. Sounds good.

266
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:36,518
Really? Oh, great!

267
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:39,283
Okay, so on Saturday? Three-ish?

268
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,106
Three-ish it is.

269
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,438
Excellent. Really.

270
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,326
Okay, I have to get back, and you have a lot of coffee to drink. So Iï¿½ll see you Saturday.

271
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,087
- See you Saturday.
- Okay!

272
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,385
Hey Luke, great boat you got out there.

273
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:56,387
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

274
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:59,710
Are you selling it, or is it some kind of seafood promotion?

275
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,570
I donï¿½t want to talk about it!

276
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,940
Good thing you parked it right outside the diner, then.

277
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:06,562
What?

278
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,082
Nothing. Nothing.

279
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:13,767
Go on. Heï¿½s right over there.

280
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:21,596
Geez, kid! Donï¿½t just stand there, youï¿½ll give me a heart attack.

281
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:28,472
Hey.

282
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:30,289
Mr. Danes.

283
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:32,371
Yeah, speak up, there, kid. Weï¿½ve got a bit of a height difference here.

284
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:34,181
I need to ask you something.

285
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:35,937
Bathrooms are in the back. Theyï¿½re for customers only,

286
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:37,827
so you have to order something. You want to order something?

287
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:39,261
You want to use the bathroom?

288
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:40,499
Well then what do you want?

289
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:43,858
What are you doing? Whatï¿½s he doing?

290
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:46,096
Donï¿½t worry. This always happens when heï¿½s terrified.

291
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,402
What the hell is he terrified of?

292
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:49,290
Bradley, would you like me to tell him for you?

293
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:52,168
- Okay. Luke.
- Whyï¿½s he doing that?

294
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:54,140
- Oh, heï¿½s fine.
- He doesnï¿½t look fine.

295
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:58,099
Luke. Luke! Eyes on me! Eyes on me. Thank you.

296
00:11:58,226 --> 00:12:01,861
Now, as you know, I teach third grade over at the elementary school.

297
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:04,503
And our production of Fiddler on the Roof is on Saturday.

298
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:06,945
And Bradley here is in charge of set design.

299
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:07,796
Right, Bradley?

300
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:10,866
So, he just wanted to come here and tell you that he will need you

301
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,696
at the school tomorrow at three oï¿½clock.

302
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:14,626
And please bring your own tools. Okay?

303
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:16,341
You did that very well, Bradley!

304
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:17,252
What are you talking about?

305
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,542
I thought Bradley was very clear.

306
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,424
What do you mean, he needs me at the school tomorrow?

307
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:21,602
He needs me at the school to do what?

308
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,497
To help build the sets.

309
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,195
Iï¿½m not going to help build any sets.

310
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:25,641
But ï¿½

311
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:27,776
I have a diner to run. I donï¿½t have time to build any sets.

312
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:29,569
But Lorelai signed you up weeks ago.

313
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:30,572
She did?

314
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,775
Yes, she did. She signed you up to build the sets

315
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:34,595
and she signed herself up to make the costumes.

316
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,603
Oh, I must have forgot about that.

317
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,346
Yeah. I know you two are having a little trouble, I mean, I saw the boat.

318
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:43,212
But I figured since it was for the kids youï¿½d still be willing to help.

319
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,454
Lorelaiï¿½s still making the costumes?

320
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:45,799
Oh, of course she is.

321
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,474
A lot of the parents are helping out,

322
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,637
with costumes, make-up, lighting, programs ï¿½

323
00:12:50,718 --> 00:12:53,864
But youï¿½ve spoken to her recently, and sheï¿½s going to be there, making the costumes?

324
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:58,210
Look, Luke. If itï¿½s going to be too hard for you to be in the same space as Lorelai, I totally ï¿½

325
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,593
No, itï¿½s fine. Iï¿½ll be there.

326
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,187
You sure?

327
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:03,356
Yeah, I mean, if other people are going to be helping out, I might as well, you know.

328
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:07,258
Itï¿½s for the kids ï¿½ Iï¿½ll see you tomorrow at three, right?

329
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:09,336
- With your tools.
- With my tools.

330
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:11,893
Thatï¿½s great. Thank you, Luke. The kidsï¿½ll be thrilled.

331
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,998
Well, thatï¿½s what matters, right?

332
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,252
Letï¿½s go, Bradley.

333
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,030
I hope heï¿½s not late.

334
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:17,623
Oh, I hope so too.

335
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,171
No more pork!

336
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:25,144
Finally, something to put on our business card.

337
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:28,574
Iï¿½m tired of it. I am out of interesting ways to serve it and Iï¿½m not buying it anymore.

338
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,970
I want another other white meat.

339
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:32,552
Mugsy raised the price on you again, huh?

340
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,559
That pig-hoarding bastard.

341
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:36,487
Well, cut it out for a month. I bet he comes around.

342
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:38,708
I guess. Ooo, whatï¿½s in the bag?

343
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:40,837
And that is ï¿½

344
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:43,219
A bag of Santa beards.

345
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:44,508
Naturally.

346
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:47,181
I need twenty-five dark beards for Fiddler on the Roof.

347
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:51,247
I drove to four different towns and six different costume shops and this is all I could find.

348
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,679
Apparently Liebermanï¿½s the only Jew in Connecticut.

349
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:55,271
- Hey, can I borrow some tea?
- Why?

350
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,946
I thought Iï¿½d use it to dye them.

351
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:58,865
Oh, very clever. Up on the shelf.

352
00:13:58,958 --> 00:13:59,414
Thanks.

353
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:02,799
So, other than the great beard search, how was your morning?

354
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:03,444
Fine.

355
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,616
Yeah? Good!

356
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,642
So, what route did you take to work today?

357
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:11,539
Oh, the usual. You know, Main Street to Oak and then a sharp starboard turn

358
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:13,745
at the marina and four nautical miles to the Inn.

359
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:14,453
You saw it.

360
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:15,441
- Oh, yeah.
- Rats.

361
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,396
I saw the back of the boat driving from Westonï¿½s,

362
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:20,330
I saw the front of the boat from the bank and then I went upstairs to the post office

363
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,044
and I got a nice aerial shot of the boat.

364
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,027
Basically I took the White House tour of the boat.

365
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:26,473
I canï¿½t believe Luke did this. I mean, what was he thinking?

366
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,038
I donï¿½t know.

367
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:28,169
When did he come get it?

368
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:31,533
Beats me. I didnï¿½t notice it gone when I left this morning, so ï¿½

369
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:32,998
Did he tell you he was going to take it?

370
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:33,592
No.

371
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:35,051
Well, I think that stinks.

372
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:37,028
Heï¿½s a jerk for pulling something like that.

373
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,527
Itï¿½s his boat. He can do what he wants with it.

374
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:40,325
Not if itï¿½s something mean. He canï¿½t.

375
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:44,436
Well, I caused the situation in the first place. I bought the boat. I put it in my garage.

376
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:47,027
I know, but he broke your heart and now heï¿½s rubbing your face in it.

377
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:48,932
- Geez, I sound pathetic.
- I know!

378
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:53,868
Look, Sookie, please. You donï¿½t have to be mad at Luke. Okay?

379
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,182
- You donï¿½t have to hate him.
- Oh, I donï¿½t mind hating him.

380
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,880
I appreciate that, but I donï¿½t really want to talk about it anymore.

381
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:00,043
Where are you going?

382
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:03,166
Did I drive you out? Iï¿½m sorry! Iï¿½ll stop talking about it.

383
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:05,399
No, itï¿½s fine. Iï¿½m fine, I just have stuff to do.

384
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:08,880
I have costumes to make and beards to convert, so Iï¿½ll see you later.

385
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:09,736
Okay.

386
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:52,920
Hey, Luke! We are so glad you to see you.

387
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:54,212
Youï¿½re ten minutes late.

388
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,555
Yeah, uh, sorry about that. Hey, I brought my tools.

389
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:58,541
Great. Well, this is Damon.

390
00:15:58,613 --> 00:15:59,484
Hey there Damon.

391
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:01,110
- My motherï¿½s a lesbian.
- Oh.

392
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,779
I brought my tools.

393
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,572
And you remember your supervisor, Bradley.

394
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,907
Yeah, Bradley. Nice to see you again, Bradley.

395
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:11,373
Well, you boys should get started. Iï¿½ll be right over here if you need my help.

396
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:12,171
Have fun!

397
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:13,689
So, where do we get started, men?

398
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,368
First we have to build Tevyeï¿½s house.

399
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:16,402
Okay, we can do that.

400
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:17,794
Thereï¿½s plans for the house over here.

401
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,126
Uh, yeah. Show me the plans.

402
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,069
Do you know any lesbians?

403
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:24,373
Uh, uh, sure, I do.

404
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,218
How many?

405
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:28,076
- Uh, Three, maybe four.
- Maybe four?

406
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:30,533
Well, waiting on confirmation.

407
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:31,609
I like lesbians.

408
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:32,812
Yeah, theyï¿½re, theyï¿½re swell.

409
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,081
Here are the plans.

410
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:36,067
Okay, letï¿½s see what we got.

411
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:38,420
All right.

412
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,966
Looks pretty simple. Looks like the boards are already cut. Okay, letï¿½s get started.

413
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:44,896
Uh, everyone grab a Philips-head screwdriver.

414
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,118
Okay, once you have your screwdriver ï¿½

415
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,176
what are you holding? Bradley, thatï¿½s a hammer.

416
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:53,005
It is?

417
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:54,245
Damon, thatï¿½s tape.

418
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,269
Oh.

419
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:58,131
I canï¿½t believe this. No one ever taught you what a Philips-head screwdriver is?

420
00:16:58,255 --> 00:16:59,509
My motherï¿½s a lesbian.

421
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:01,121
Uh-huh, okay. Come here.

422
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:05,336
See, this is a Philips-head screwdriver.

423
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:09,598
And this is a flathead screwdriver.

424
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:12,550
- See, ï¿½cause itï¿½s got a ï¿½
- Flat head!

425
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:16,403
Yes, exactly. Now, we need a Philips-head screwdriver,

426
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:19,716
so go ahead and find that, and weï¿½ll get started. Okay?

427
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:22,575
Hurry up, we get done by five, beers are on me.

428
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:26,063
Well, well, well, look who Santa stuffed in my stocking.

429
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:27,531
Yeah, Carrie. What a surprise.

430
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:31,024
Isnï¿½t life a scream? My God, you look fantastic.

431
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:34,346
Breakups agree with Luke Danes. Give me a hug.

432
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:36,539
Yeah, easy there, kids are here.

433
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,215
So, how are you?

434
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,325
I heard all about it. I tell you, that Lorelai is out of her mind.

435
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,007
I mean, thatï¿½s apparent from the outfits alone,

436
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:48,340
but to let one of the last real He-Men go free, she should up that dosage, baby.

437
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:49,298
Carrie, what are you doing here?

438
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:52,237
Oh, Iï¿½m the director, isnï¿½t that fabulous? Jenny got me into it.

439
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,884
- Jenny is your ï¿½
- My youngest, sheï¿½s seven.

440
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:57,403
God help her, the spitting image of her father.

441
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:58,264
Yeah, where is she?

442
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,669
Oh, sheï¿½s hiding under a chair somewhere. Sheï¿½s so odd, that girl.

443
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:04,055
- Sheï¿½s always hiding from me.
- Yeah, crazy.

444
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,282
Anyway, I gotta build Tevyeï¿½s house, here.

445
00:18:06,314 --> 00:18:10,234
Oh, I have to get rehearsals started anyway. Itï¿½s good to see you Luke,

446
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:13,661
- weï¿½ll have to catch up later.
- Yeah, sure, we sure will, Carr.

447
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:19,589
Donï¿½t you ever leave me alone with her again!

448
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:23,993
Okay, kids. I need my cast right here in the middle of the stage.

449
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:26,655
Everybody, letï¿½s gather right here.

450
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:27,940
Hey, Luke. Youï¿½re helping out here?

451
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:29,677
Oh, yeah. Sets. How about you?

452
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:30,747
Iï¿½m playing Tevye.

453
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,856
- Youï¿½re ï¿½
- Come on, kids. Chop, chop.

454
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:34,464
Excuse me, my directorï¿½s calling.

455
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,221
Okay, now, before we start rehearsal,

456
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:40,597
I just want to ask, has anybody seen Jenny?

457
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,776
Okay, never mind.

458
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:45,439
Now, I need to remind you that I need to know whose mommies and daddies

459
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,137
are going to be coming to the show.

460
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:51,140
Yes, Damon, I know your mommyï¿½s a lesbian, but is she coming to the show?

461
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,175
Okay, great. And everyone else, I need to know so I can issue your tickets.

462
00:18:55,324 --> 00:18:56,235
Yes, Kirk.

463
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:58,109
My motherï¿½s going to be in Florida.

464
00:18:58,268 --> 00:18:59,154
Okay, fine.

465
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:02,570
Everybody else, tell me or Miss Kuschner by the end of the day.

466
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:05,672
Now before we start, does anybody have to go potty?

467
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:10,013
Well, go now and go fast, we have a lot of work to do.

468
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:13,726
Iï¿½ll just be two minutes and then itï¿½s Lï¿½Chaim to Life.

469
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:15,078
Hey, Lulu?

470
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:17,059
Yes?

471
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:20,383
I was just wondering, where are all the other tall people?

472
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:21,431
Excuse me?

473
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,602
You know, other people to help out with the lighting, the makeup, the costumes.

474
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:27,438
Oh, theyï¿½ll be here. They all come in at different times.

475
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:29,506
Okay, I was just asking. No biggie.

476
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:32,113
Iï¿½m here! Iï¿½m done, I flushed.

477
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:33,269
Good boy, Kirk!

478
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:36,542
Okay, everyone take your places for the top of the show!

479
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,124
What is Kirk doing in the play?

480
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:40,782
Oh, we couldnï¿½t find a boy who could handle the part.

481
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:43,680
But itï¿½s an elementary school play. How hard could the part be?

482
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,025
Tevye is a very demanding role.

483
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:46,568
But ï¿½

484
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:47,683
We looked and looked.

485
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,094
We even opened up auditions to the scary extension school kids, but nothing.

486
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:55,256
And you know, we had a terrible experience last year when we did Jesus Christ Superstar.

487
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:55,707
Oh, yeah.

488
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:58,446
Jesus was allergic to peanuts and stuffed one up his nose

489
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:00,776
and broke out in terrible hives during intermission.

490
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,401
The second act was all Judas and Pontius Pilate ï¿½ pure disaster.

491
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:06,547
We had to refund money, it was a nightmare.

492
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,077
So this year, we went with a ringer.

493
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,601
A fiddler on the roof?

494
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,108
Sounds crazy, no?

495
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,227
Oh, boy, does it.

496
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,766
I got ï¿½em! Iï¿½m here!

497
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,599
Oh, great. Get in here.

498
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:20,529
I got all the glue and glitter they had.

499
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:21,421
Perfect.

500
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,443
So, what are you thinking here?

501
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:24,755
I donï¿½t know.

502
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:27,180
Something colorful, or something peaceful.

503
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:31,434
You know, it could be a Zen sort of space, or a yoga studio.

504
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:32,583
Drew Barrymore has one.

505
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,171
Oh, and she looks very calm.

506
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:37,390
Yeah. I just want it to be a special all-me alone place.

507
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:38,871
Here, look in this for ideas.

508
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,307
Ooo, classic Hollywood homes.

509
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:42,255
Oh, and look what I found.

510
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,329
A disco ball! Whereï¿½d you find a disco ball?

511
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,203
In my closet.

512
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:46,017
Wow.

513
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:50,114
I should have done this years ago.

514
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:51,731
Hello?

515
00:20:51,824 --> 00:20:54,354
I heard a noise in the kitchen.

516
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:55,338
What kind of noise?

517
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,130
A ï¿½bamï¿½, or a ï¿½clangï¿½.

518
00:20:57,196 --> 00:20:58,727
Possibly a ï¿½crashï¿½.

519
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:01,754
It might have a ï¿½whamï¿½ or a ï¿½kapowï¿½.

520
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:02,716
Well, did you go check it out?

521
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:06,038
Excuse me, Iï¿½m extremely busy.

522
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,268
Someone here has to work, I mean, the two of you just run off

523
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:13,816
to do your little decorating project and you leave me here alone.

524
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,778
Michel! Did you actually hear a noise?

525
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:19,802
Of course I heard a noise. It was a ï¿½thwapï¿½ or a ï¿½vroomï¿½.

526
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,133
Gotta go, Michel.

527
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,121
- Oy.
- Whatï¿½s a matter?

528
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,087
Apparently Batmanï¿½s attacking the inn.

529
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:27,888
Hmm. Hey, Moulin Rouge, what do you think?

530
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:30,259
Jeweled elephant in one corner, Ewan McGregor in the other.

531
00:21:30,314 --> 00:21:31,194
Ooo, sounds yummy.

532
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:35,997
What, Michel?

533
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:39,429
Iï¿½m smelling something very funny coming from the kitchen.

534
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:42,771
Could be a pungent cheese, could be arson.

535
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,833
Should I call the firemen to come, or should I just fetch some crackers?

536
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:52,142
Ah, Rory. Good.

537
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:54,867
Iï¿½m glad youï¿½re here. I wanted to talk to you about something.

538
00:21:55,404 --> 00:21:58,374
I think we need to discuss the incident at the Daily News the other day.

539
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,572
What incident, Doyle?

540
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,084
We were in the middle of a meeting.

541
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,176
I, your editor, was talking,

542
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,635
and suddenly, without warning, you flew out of the room.

543
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:07,703
I was gone for five minutes, Doyle.

544
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:11,501
Yes, but the very fact that you felt comfortable enough to leave signals a big problem.

545
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,873
I had to talk to a friend.

546
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:15,250
This is a matter of respect, Rory.

547
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:19,331
Respect for the paper, respect for me. Frankly, respect for yourself.

548
00:22:19,402 --> 00:22:19,884
Doyle ï¿½

549
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:20,989
I have a pebble in my shoe.

550
00:22:21,246 --> 00:22:23,632
Damn thingï¿½s been driving me crazy all day long.

551
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:27,492
- Anyhow, where was I?
- My lack of respect for you.

552
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:28,439
Yes, good, thank you.

553
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:31,722
You have to remember that this is college. Youï¿½re dealing with real life here.

554
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:34,846
You have to start developing boundaries between your work and your personal life.

555
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:35,727
- Doyle!
- What?

556
00:22:35,782 --> 00:22:38,116
- Your sock is on my coffee table!
- Just for a second.

557
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:39,438
You want to talk about boundaries?

558
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:42,648
You are here every day. You eat my food. You drink my soda.

559
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:44,504
You have a key and you donï¿½t even live here.

560
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:45,807
Paris said ï¿½mi casa su casaï¿½.

561
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:48,373
Great. Well, Parisï¿½ casa is right in there,

562
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,655
so go in or get lost, because I have company coming,

563
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:53,831
and I donï¿½t want the first thing he sees when he walks in to be your feet or your face.

564
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:55,598
But ï¿½ but Iï¿½m your editor.

565
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:57,931
Out! And take your pebble with you!

566
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:01,710
Bet Woodward and Bernstein never tossed Ben Bradley out of their room.

567
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:03,804
Ben Bradley kept his shoes on!

568
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,741
I donï¿½t know if anyoneï¿½s noticed, but suddenly I am the only one working.

569
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:10,585
Youï¿½re right, no one noticed.

570
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,151
My arm is cramping up.

571
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:14,189
We offered to take over, Michel.

572
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:16,305
These stencils are antiques.

573
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:19,689
Theyï¿½ve been handed down from generation to generation of Girards.

574
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:21,936
No one touches these stencils but me.

575
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:22,715
Okay.

576
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:24,808
The fumes are making me sick.

577
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:26,581
Oh, my God, you had a fit to be included,

578
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:28,249
and youï¿½ve done nothing but complain since you got here.

579
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,155
I did not have a fit to be included.

580
00:23:30,252 --> 00:23:32,684
I have a life. I have plenty of friends.

581
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:36,360
And I dare you to find anyone who has a larger collection of techno and world music than I do.

582
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:38,946
Feel that I need nothing from either one of you.

583
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:39,898
Poor Michel.

584
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:42,730
No, do not ï¿½poor Michelï¿½ me. No.

585
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:47,200
Well, I have to say, for only a few hoursï¿½ work, this place looks pretty snazzy.

586
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:50,847
Ah, I have finished with this wall.

587
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,766
Super, three more to go.

588
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:58,302
Well, yes. Sometimes doing one wall makes it the focal point, the place of interest.

589
00:23:58,606 --> 00:23:59,914
All four walls, Michel.

590
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:01,394
You tricked me into this.

591
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:02,578
Just like Tom Sawyer.

592
00:24:02,644 --> 00:24:03,632
So, what do you think?

593
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,858
Is it turning into exactly what you had in mind?

594
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:08,338
Your special, all-you, alone place?

595
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,158
Yeah. It sure is.

596
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:20,574
Whatï¿½s up, Doc?

597
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:21,249
Whatï¿½s up Doc?

598
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:23,201
Well, Harpo doesnï¿½t talk, so thereï¿½s no catch phrase.

599
00:24:23,258 --> 00:24:23,964
Well, then, do Groucho.

600
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,798
Everybody does Groucho. Come in! Come in!

601
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:29,862
I like what youï¿½ve done with the place.

602
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:32,848
Well, itï¿½s all about the vibe. Whatï¿½d you bring?

603
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,434
Just some leftovers from the Cartina engagement party.

604
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:36,918
I told you I would take car of the food.

605
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:38,572
And I see you did.

606
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:40,318
Pretzels of the world.

607
00:24:40,472 --> 00:24:43,983
San Francisco sourdough, German pumpernickel, chocolate covered Swiss,

608
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:47,634
and the wasabi bites are very intriguing. I also ordered a pizza before you got here.

609
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,474
Okay, well, at least we got the food part covered.

610
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,907
Yes, we do. Sit, sit, sit.

611
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:57,156
You going to stay like that all night?

612
00:24:57,507 --> 00:24:58,540
Oh, no. Sorry.

613
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:00,088
- I mean, you can.
- No, itï¿½s okay.

614
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:01,403
- I mean, it works for you.
- No, Iï¿½m good.

615
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,688
I guess we should start the movie.

616
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:06,353
Okay.

617
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:16,903
- Wasabi nugget?
- Thanks.

618
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:23,938
You in a little bit of pain there?

619
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:26,451
Much, much more than a little!

620
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:29,375
Well, donï¿½t worry! Your mouth will get numb in about a minute.

621
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,727
Iï¿½m really looking forward to that.

622
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:32,703
- How about a soda?
- That would be terrific, thanks.

623
00:25:33,554 --> 00:25:38,283
Oh, thank you very much for kicking my undefined sexual male partner out of the room that we share.

624
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,590
I had company coming, Paris.

625
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:42,505
You insulted him, you demeaned him. You mad him feel unwelcome.

626
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:43,758
He was unwelcome.

627
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:46,048
And now, thanks to you, he refuses to come back here

628
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:49,421
which means I have to spend the night over at his place with his three roommates!

629
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:51,274
The place is a health violation.

630
00:25:51,346 --> 00:25:54,254
Things grow on the windowsill without the help of pots or soil

631
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:56,363
and there is the faint aroma of sweat socks

632
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:59,385
and starter cologne lingering in the air at all times, and yes!

633
00:25:59,502 --> 00:26:03,042
I have to bring my own toilet paper over there because it is a third world country.

634
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:04,618
Thank you! Very, very much!

635
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,397
God, I missed this place.

636
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:16,568
Now that is a counter-sunk screw, Damon. Good man.

637
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:18,176
Your lesbian mother will be proud.

638
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:23,645
Oh, hey. Lulu. Itï¿½s a big day, you know?

639
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,457
I know. Itï¿½s so exciting.

640
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:29,472
Yeah. But, uh, Iï¿½m still wondering where the other adults are.

641
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:30,239
Theyï¿½ll be here.

642
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:32,867
Yeah, youï¿½ve been saying that for days and Iï¿½m still the only person in here

643
00:26:32,928 --> 00:26:35,516
that doesnï¿½t have to hang his sheets out the window in the morning.

644
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:36,471
I donï¿½t understand.

645
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,582
They wet their beds, Lulu.

646
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:40,402
Oh, right. Well, I promise you, Luke.

647
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:43,071
By tonight, thereï¿½ll be lots of grownups here for you to talk to.

648
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:45,488
Itï¿½s not about having someone to talk to, itï¿½s ï¿½

649
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:47,597
- Luke, weï¿½ve got a problem.
- Yeah, what is it, Kirk?

650
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:51,008
- Well, this dairy cart you made me ï¿½
- Whatï¿½s wrong with it?

651
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:54,924
It pulls too easily and the wheel doesnï¿½t wobble.

652
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,626
So what?

653
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,277
Well, itï¿½s too good. You built me a twenty-first century dairy cart.

654
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:01,398
Thereï¿½s no such thing as a twenty-first century dairy cart.

655
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:05,077
Exactly. Look, Tevyeï¿½s a poor man. Youï¿½ve heard the song.

656
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:06,977
Yes, Iï¿½ve heard the song, Kirk.

657
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,543
Okay, so heï¿½s poor. Heï¿½s tired.

658
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:11,417
Heï¿½s suffering, and his horse is lame.

659
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:14,105
His life is hard, so pulling this cart should be hard.

660
00:27:14,177 --> 00:27:15,906
Youï¿½re an actor. Pretend itï¿½s hard.

661
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:16,977
Iï¿½m not that kind of actor.

662
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,538
For my type of work, it has to be legitimately hard.

663
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:23,496
There you go. Remember to thank me in your acceptance speech.

664
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:24,628
Thank you, Luke.

665
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:29,154
Hey, this is impossible!

666
00:27:29,307 --> 00:27:31,371
All right, kids, breakï¿½s over!

667
00:27:31,503 --> 00:27:34,371
Kirk, letï¿½s take it from the last part of your first monologue.

668
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:35,861
All right, places, everyone!

669
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:41,277
And ï¿½ music.

670
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:48,129
Because of our traditions, weï¿½ve kept our balance for many, many years.

671
00:27:48,277 --> 00:27:52,384
Here, in Anatevka, we have traditions for everything.

672
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:56,143
How to eat, how to sleep, how to wear clothes.

673
00:27:56,444 --> 00:27:59,798
For instance, we always keep our heads covered,

674
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,436
and always wear a little prayer shawl.

675
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:05,666
This shows our constant devotion to God.

676
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:09,484
You may ask, how did this tradition start?

677
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:11,246
Iï¿½ll tell you.

678
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:13,238
I donï¿½t know.

679
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,994
But itï¿½s a tradition.

680
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:19,046
Because of our traditions, everyone knows who he is

681
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:21,210
and what God expects him to do.

682
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,447
Who, day and night, must scramble for a living?

683
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:27,582
Feed his wife and children? Say his daily prayers?

684
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:30,566
And who has the right, as master of the house,

685
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,412
to have the final word at home.

686
00:28:33,822 --> 00:28:37,012
The papa, the papa!

687
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:39,689
Tradition!

688
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:43,161
The papa, the papa!

689
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:45,590
Tradition!

690
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,498
Hey, she tripped! Yente tripped!

691
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:54,806
Damn it! I was feeling it, people! I was feeling it!

692
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:56,002
Anna, honey, are you okay?

693
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:58,062
No, sheï¿½s not okay! She tripped!

694
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:59,301
Sheï¿½s fine, Luke.

695
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:02,357
How would you know if sheï¿½s fine? Your kidï¿½s under a chair somewhere.

696
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:04,313
- Luke ï¿½
- Her costume doesnï¿½t fit.

697
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,222
- Weï¿½ll fix it before the show!
- It shouldï¿½ve been fixed by now!

698
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,119
I mean, this shouldnï¿½t have happened! There were supposed to be other adults here!

699
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:13,690
This is ridiculous!

700
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:16,243
This is completely unacceptable!

701
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:21,497
He takes his work very seriously.

702
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,074
I mean it. Just try and pull this cart.

703
00:29:29,258 --> 00:29:29,796
Hey.

704
00:29:29,986 --> 00:29:31,363
Hey. Luke, what are you ï¿½

705
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:32,494
Yente tripped!

706
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:33,724
What?

707
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:36,441
She tripped, just as she was heading out to tell Avram about Ruchel.

708
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:37,283
The shoemakerï¿½s daughter?

709
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:38,932
Yeah, sheï¿½s trying to fix him up with Avramï¿½s son.

710
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:41,021
Sheï¿½s almost blind, she can hardly see.

711
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:45,331
Hey, I am not doing a bit with you here. The kid tripped, because her dress was too long!

712
00:29:45,393 --> 00:29:46,243
Okay, is she hurt?

713
00:29:46,304 --> 00:29:48,527
Of course sheï¿½s not hurt, but she completely blew her entrance.

714
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:51,439
All the people of Anatevka are standing around with their goats,

715
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:53,216
she tripped and they have to reset the goats!

716
00:29:53,303 --> 00:29:53,865
Luke ï¿½

717
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,418
And if you were there where you were supposed to be,

718
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,819
her costume wouldï¿½ve fit, and Yente wouldnï¿½t have tripped.

719
00:29:57,886 --> 00:29:59,821
What do you mean, where I was supposed to be?

720
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,855
Youï¿½re making the costumes. At least thatï¿½s the rumor.

721
00:30:01,922 --> 00:30:03,340
Iï¿½m making the sets, and Iï¿½m there.

722
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:05,961
Yeah. I am making the costumes. Iï¿½m making the costumes here

723
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,472
and then Iï¿½m bringing them there when they are done.

724
00:30:07,518 --> 00:30:09,276
Oh, sure. A likely story.

725
00:30:09,345 --> 00:30:10,820
Hey, what is your problem?

726
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,283
My problem is that Iï¿½m spending the day teaching a bunch of kids to use tools

727
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:16,720
which wonï¿½t properly fit in their hands for another eight to ten years,

728
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,831
because you signed me up to do it, and then youï¿½re not even there when youï¿½re supposed to be!

729
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:21,935
- Well, you couldï¿½ve said no.
- I couldï¿½ve said no.

730
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:25,552
Have you tried saying no to Bradley when heï¿½s got a giant inhaler shoved in his mouth?

731
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:26,878
- No.
- Well you canï¿½t!

732
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:29,381
What the hell am I looking at?

733
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:33,902
Itï¿½s my new special alone space.

734
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:36,324
Oh, yeah? Well, you got a whole house of special alone space.

735
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:37,210
Not like this.

736
00:30:37,284 --> 00:30:39,288
So, what, are you going to hang out in your garage, now?

737
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,020
I donï¿½t know, maybe! I mean, why not?

738
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:43,793
Itï¿½s not like I have a boat that needs storage, or anything!

739
00:30:43,938 --> 00:30:44,941
You could park your car in here.

740
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:48,568
I never park my car in here! I have never, ever parked my car in here, Luke!

741
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:49,682
And you know that!

742
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:53,821
But I come home to this big, huge, suddenly empty space,

743
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,935
and I thought I would try to do something nice,

744
00:30:55,995 --> 00:30:58,407
so it wasnï¿½t just a giant hole of depression sitting out here!

745
00:30:58,474 --> 00:30:59,924
I thought I was doing you a favor.

746
00:30:59,995 --> 00:31:01,394
- Oh, please.
- I did!

747
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,627
Well, gee, thanks a lot.

748
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:04,307
- Itï¿½s your garage!
- Whatever.

749
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,509
I mean, what was I supposed to do, leave the thing in here forever?

750
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:10,184
Oh, no. Absolutely not. Much better to sneak it out of here and park it

751
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,394
in front of the diner like a giant they broke upï¿½ billboard for the whole town to see.

752
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:14,839
I didnï¿½t mean it like that.

753
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:16,174
Well, how did you mean it, Luke?

754
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:19,083
I canï¿½t believe youï¿½re mad at me for getting my boat out of your garage!

755
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,019
Iï¿½m not mad at you for getting your boat out of my garage.

756
00:31:21,074 --> 00:31:23,307
Iï¿½m mad at you for the way you got the boat out of my garage.

757
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:24,357
What, did I ruin the lawn?

758
00:31:24,427 --> 00:31:26,123
You didnï¿½t even call me, Luke.

759
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:28,084
You didnï¿½t leave a message or a note or anything.

760
00:31:28,146 --> 00:31:31,464
You just snuck in and took it, and I got to come home and find it gone.

761
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:33,322
Although, I didnï¿½t come home and find it gone!

762
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:35,862
I drove by the diner and assumed it was gone!

763
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,072
You know what, it doesnï¿½t matter. ï¿½Cause itï¿½s done.

764
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:39,975
Weï¿½re done. Itï¿½s fine.

765
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:42,058
- Iï¿½m not mad.
- I can tell.

766
00:31:42,217 --> 00:31:44,551
Well, I have dresses to make, so Iï¿½ll see you at the theater.

767
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:54,182
I am going to say something that will upset possibly everyone in the entire world.

768
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:54,765
Wow.

769
00:31:54,838 --> 00:31:57,270
I thought the I Love Lucy episode with Harpo Marx was lame.

770
00:31:57,507 --> 00:31:58,146
Get out.

771
00:31:58,212 --> 00:32:01,534
Thereï¿½s no way Harpo even for a second would have believed he was looking in a mirror.

772
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:04,447
And the last time they made that ï¿½popping up from behind the partitionï¿½ move,

773
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,091
Lucy was totally slower than him.

774
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,165
Youï¿½ve carried this with you for a very long time.

775
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:10,788
I mean, we had to believe a lot during those Hollywood shows.

776
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,644
Dori Shary just happened to be hanging out in their pool.

777
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:16,856
And Iï¿½m sorry, I was totally with Lucy when Ricky took those women

778
00:32:16,907 --> 00:32:19,406
to the premiere of his movie. What an ass.

779
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,443
Youï¿½ve got to stop watching I Love Lucy.

780
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:24,524
Oh, man, I hope thatï¿½s Paris.

781
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,089
Maybe she and Doyle had a fight. That would be great.

782
00:32:27,265 --> 00:32:31,063
Thereï¿½s so much darkness under this bosom buddies exterior of yours.

783
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:33,418
Hello stranger.

784
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:34,874
Hi. Youï¿½re back.

785
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:35,719
Just rolled in.

786
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:37,479
So, how was it? Was it fun?

787
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:39,117
No, very dull. Letï¿½s not talk about it.

788
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:40,946
Weï¿½re all going to China Palace for food. Grab your coat, letï¿½s go.

789
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,101
Oh, um. I canï¿½t.

790
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:45,482
What? Sure you can. Come on. I missed you, let me buy you a fortune cookie.

791
00:32:45,554 --> 00:32:46,639
I kind of have company.

792
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:47,719
Really, anyone I know?

793
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:50,904
Hey, Marty, good to see you.

794
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:52,373
Uh, yeah. You too.

795
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:53,699
Well, you come too. The more the merrier.

796
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:54,805
Oh, well ï¿½

797
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,244
Come on, Marty. If youï¿½re going to be hanging with Ace like this,

798
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:58,390
itï¿½s time I get to know you without a waiterï¿½s uniform on. Letï¿½s go.

799
00:32:58,466 --> 00:32:59,364
Carï¿½s waiting outside.

800
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,126
We do not have to go.

801
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:04,449
But you want to.

802
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,078
No. Well, I mean, if you do. But you donï¿½t, so forget it.

803
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,618
Uh, itï¿½s cool. Letï¿½s go.

804
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,953
Really? Are you sure? Because you donï¿½t look sure.

805
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,120
Sure. Iï¿½m sure.

806
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:16,151
Carï¿½s waiting outside.

807
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:20,142
Okay. But if we get bored, or if Dori Shary happens to be there then we bail.

808
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:21,513
- Deal.
- Okay, Iï¿½ll get my coat.

809
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:26,568
I swear, I thought he was never going to wake up.

810
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,133
If I knew the hangover was going to last that long I wouldnï¿½t have.

811
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,009
Thereï¿½s nothing like a ï¿½you wouldnï¿½t believe how drunk I wasï¿½ story to get the girls all hot.

812
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:34,269
It always worked before.

813
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,721
Oh, God, the smell of this food is making me ill.

814
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:37,924
Mmm, I think itï¿½s delicious.

815
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:39,107
How can you eat like that?

816
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:41,360
Juliet hasnï¿½t eaten a meal since 1994.

817
00:33:41,483 --> 00:33:43,372
My metabolism simply doesnï¿½t accept food.

818
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,856
Yes, that must be it. A modern medical miracle. May I?

819
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:47,637
Sure. Hey, Marty, do you want some beer?

820
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:49,321
Here you go, man. I got you.

821
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:49,947
Thanks.

822
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,209
Rosemaryï¿½s going home with me tonight. I just thought everyone at this table should know.

823
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,098
Oh, Finn, you do hallucinate.

824
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:56,372
Are you going to eat that fried shrimp?

825
00:33:56,445 --> 00:33:57,069
I think I am.

826
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,128
Oh, God, can I watch?

827
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,333
Juliet, just eat something!

828
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:02,962
No! I am not eating until I get married to some gorgeous but very poor man

829
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:06,219
who will sign an iron-clad pre-nup and get very, very fat,

830
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:08,967
but he wonï¿½t ever leave me because he would be cut off without a penny and die in a trailer park.

831
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,858
- My God, that is brilliant.
- That is sick.

832
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,567
I agree with anything Rosemary says tonight.

833
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,878
Not going home with you, Finn.

834
00:34:13,944 --> 00:34:15,669
You know where they had the best Chinese food in the world?

835
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:17,483
This tiny little place outside of Zugerberg.

836
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,887
Aw, Zugerberg.

837
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:20,457
The golden days of Zugerberg.

838
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:21,287
Whatï¿½s Zugerberg?

839
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:23,417
Zugerberg is the boarding school I went to in Switzerland.

840
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,053
Really?

841
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,557
Yep. Grade seven through twelve.

842
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,498
Wow. Living in Switzerland? That sounds exciting.

843
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:28,374
Boarding school.

844
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:30,069
Man, that mustï¿½ve sucked.

845
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:31,624
Sucked? Are you kidding?

846
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,288
Those are the greatest days of my life.

847
00:34:33,356 --> 00:34:35,389
Oh my God, the partying that went on there. Insane.

848
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,975
I did a year at Andover. Not bad.

849
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,984
So you didnï¿½t miss your home, your family?

850
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,390
My family? Did I miss my family?

851
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:42,628
Logan, did I miss my family?

852
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,425
Huh, letï¿½s see. Which mom were you on then?

853
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,294
- I believe it was the blonde.
- Ah, yes.

854
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:47,908
- She was hot.
- You didnï¿½t know her, Finn.

855
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:49,592
All your mothers have been hot, Colin.

856
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,594
No, Marty, I didnï¿½t miss my family.

857
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:00,579
Tevye. I suppose you know why Iï¿½ve come to see you.

858
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:04,962
Yes, I do, Rabbi Lazar, but thereï¿½s no use talking about it.

859
00:35:05,096 --> 00:35:05,982
Why not?

860
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:09,372
Why yes? Why should I get rid of her?

861
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:12,009
Well, you have a few more without her.

862
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,324
I see. Today you want one, tomorrow you may want two.

863
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,076
Hold still. Looks good. There you go.

864
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,249
Now, no more bottle butting till the showï¿½s over.

865
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:26,780
Here you go, Paulie. Sneak that out there when they start dancing.

866
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,726
Why is it so important to you?

867
00:35:28,848 --> 00:35:31,686
Frankly, because Iï¿½m lonesome.

868
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:34,671
Lonesome? What are you talking about?

869
00:35:34,903 --> 00:35:36,038
You donï¿½t know?

870
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:38,167
Weï¿½re talking about my new cow!

871
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:40,990
- Iï¿½ve got a hammer.
- Oh, I know you do.

872
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:43,903
A milk cow? So I wonï¿½t get lonesome?

873
00:35:45,072 --> 00:35:46,027
Whatï¿½s so funny?

874
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:48,993
I was talking about your daughter.

875
00:35:49,074 --> 00:35:51,469
- I need that schwanza.
- Oh, I got it. I got it.

876
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:53,425
- Sarah ï¿½ whereï¿½d Sarah go?
- Relax, weï¿½ll find her.

877
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,183
Okay, the nightï¿½s young. Where are we going next?

878
00:35:58,269 --> 00:35:59,538
I donï¿½t think I can move.

879
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,096
- Youï¿½re full?
- Iï¿½m full.

880
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:03,338
- Is it fabulous?
- You know, Juliet, it doesnï¿½t suck.

881
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:04,420
Letï¿½s go to the Alligator Lounge.

882
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:06,613
Yes. Perfect. Zydeco music. Youï¿½ll love this place.

883
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:07,250
Well, I ï¿½

884
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:08,901
What do you say, Marty? You up for a little Cajun craziness?

885
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,866
- Uh, I ï¿½
- Okay. I got it.

886
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,186
Everybody owes seventy-five bucks.

887
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,933
Pony up, please, so we can get the hell out of here.

888
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:14,911
Seventy-five?

889
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:16,114
I got you.

890
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:17,895
Okay. Are you okay? Do you have enough?

891
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:18,941
Uh, I donï¿½t ï¿½

892
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,358
Hey, donï¿½t sweat it, man. I can cover you, too.

893
00:36:20,424 --> 00:36:21,166
No thanks.

894
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,837
Itï¿½s no big deal. I invited you. My treat.

895
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:23,686
Itï¿½s okay.

896
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:26,548
I just need to find an ATM. Iï¿½ll be right back.

897
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:27,195
Marty ï¿½

898
00:36:27,308 --> 00:36:28,049
An ATM.

899
00:36:28,532 --> 00:36:29,734
My, how quaint.

900
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:30,717
Iï¿½ll be right back.

901
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:31,788
You okay?

902
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:33,092
Oh, yeah. No, Iï¿½m fine. I just ï¿½

903
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:36,083
I think I remember seeing a bank across the street, so Iï¿½ll go catch Marty.

904
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,498
You couldnï¿½t find an ATM?

905
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:48,525
Oh, no, thereï¿½s at least six ATMï¿½s within a two block radius.

906
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:52,205
And every single one of them is going to tell me that I only have eighteen dollars in my account.

907
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:53,963
And then I believe they will flip me off.

908
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:57,614
Well, I think some of the more reputable banks have suspended their flipping off policies.

909
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:58,789
I canï¿½t go back in there.

910
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:01,808
I canï¿½t leave. So here I stand, frozen on the sidewalk.

911
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,132
Here. I have some money.

912
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:06,518
No.

913
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:08,321
Marty, just take it.

914
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:09,892
Iï¿½m not going to take your money.

915
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,374
Well, youï¿½re not going to just stand out here for the rest of the night.

916
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,137
Well, why not?

917
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,998
Because. At the very least, when all those guys come out of the restaurant, theyï¿½ll see you.

918
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:19,508
Come on. Please, Marty.

919
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:23,384
Look, just say you found an ATM, take the money, weï¿½ll go inside,

920
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:25,732
youï¿½ll hand it to the guys, and then weï¿½ll leave. You and me.

921
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,035
What about the Zydeco club?

922
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:29,431
Well, Iï¿½ve never felt the need for Zydeco before in my life.

923
00:37:29,487 --> 00:37:30,650
No need to change that now.

924
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:31,602
Come on, please?

925
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:34,639
Yeah.

926
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:38,582
And I thought getting pantsed at the prom was going to be the low point in my life.

927
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:47,003
Do you love me?

928
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,764
Do I what?

929
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:55,682
Do you love me?

930
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:59,187
Do I love you?

931
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:04,930
With our daughters getting married, and the trouble in the town,

932
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:11,147
youï¿½re upset, youï¿½re worn out, go inside, go lie down!

933
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:13,256
Maybe itï¿½s indigestion.

934
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:16,476
Golde, Iï¿½m asking you a question.

935
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:17,352
Okay, go.

936
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,441
Do you love me?

937
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:24,505
Iï¿½m your wife!

938
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:25,610
I know!

939
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,679
But do you love me?

940
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:34,238
Do I love him?

941
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:37,810
For twenty-five years Iï¿½ve lived with him,

942
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,131
fought with him, starved with him.

943
00:38:40,245 --> 00:38:43,163
Twenty-five years my bed is his.

944
00:38:43,357 --> 00:38:46,793
If thatï¿½s not love, what is?

945
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:49,271
Then you love me?

946
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:51,519
I suppose I do.

947
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:59,293
And I suppose I love you too.

948
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:04,751
It doesnï¿½t change a thing,

949
00:39:05,502 --> 00:39:08,207
but even so,

950
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,419
after twenty-five years,

951
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:22,982
itï¿½s nice to know.

952
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:39,859
- Iï¿½ll pay you back next weekend.
- Marty, please forget about it.

953
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,128
I work a party Saturday night. Iï¿½ll pay you on Sunday.

954
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:44,421
Thereï¿½s a possibility it may all be in ones, but ï¿½

955
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:45,896
Iï¿½m really sorry about tonight.

956
00:39:46,796 --> 00:39:48,159
No need to apologize.

957
00:39:48,724 --> 00:39:51,181
You want to come in? We still have a few movies left to watch.

958
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:56,347
Rory, I feel like I really need to tell you something.

959
00:39:56,904 --> 00:39:57,653
Okay.

960
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:01,160
Um, I know weï¿½re friends.

961
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:03,950
And Iï¿½m glad weï¿½re friends.

962
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:08,164
But I donï¿½t want to be just friends anymore.

963
00:40:08,215 --> 00:40:09,084
I like you.

964
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:11,891
I like ï¿½ Logan.

965
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,466
Yeah. I figured.

966
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,583
I donï¿½t know why.

967
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,963
Really? ï¿½Cause Iï¿½ve got a few guesses.

968
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:19,624
Iï¿½m sorry.

969
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,639
Um, I donï¿½t know what to say.

970
00:40:22,732 --> 00:40:25,871
Itï¿½s okay. You donï¿½t have to say anything.

971
00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:29,629
Are we still friends? Please say that weï¿½re still friends.

972
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:30,458
Sure.

973
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:32,374
Weï¿½re still friends.

974
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:35,625
Please come back in. We can watch Duck Soup again. Please?

975
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:38,205
I donï¿½t really want to watch Duck Soup right now, Rory.

976
00:40:38,763 --> 00:40:44,062
I really like Duck Soup, so I really donï¿½t want to associate it with this particular night.

977
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:45,769
I understand.

978
00:40:46,316 --> 00:40:47,028
Yeah.

979
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:53,264
Iï¿½ll pay you back next weekend.

980
00:40:53,341 --> 00:40:54,129
Okay.

981
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:19,362
- Hey.
- Hey.

982
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:22,162
- Can I?
- Yeah, sure.

983
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,195
Huh. That move always seems cooler in the movies.

984
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:33,924
No, I think you maneuver your way through a window quite gracefully.

985
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:34,707
Thank you.

986
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:36,549
I assume youï¿½ve had practice.

987
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:37,908
No, first time.

988
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,432
Iï¿½m sure.

989
00:41:41,006 --> 00:41:43,150
So, how was the Zydeco music?

990
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:46,992
Ah, I left when Finn jumped in on vocals.

991
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,588
Excellent self-preservational instinct.

992
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,674
I just wanted to make sure you got home okay.

993
00:41:52,915 --> 00:41:54,148
Oh, yeah, I got home okay.

994
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,742
So I see.

995
00:41:56,606 --> 00:41:58,321
Thanks for the concern, I appreciate it.

996
00:41:58,572 --> 00:41:59,816
It wasnï¿½t all concern.

997
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,615
Oh, really?

998
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,301
No. I donï¿½t believe I said a proper goodnight to you this evening.

999
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:06,847
No, you didnï¿½t.

1000
00:42:08,203 --> 00:42:09,188
Good night, Ace.

1001
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:22,412
I thought you said a proper goodnight.

1002
00:42:28,066 --> 00:42:29,928
You want to get changed into something more comfortable?

1003
00:42:30,002 --> 00:42:30,841
More comfortable than this?

1004
00:42:30,913 --> 00:42:34,019
I actually was hoping for some feetsie pajamas.

1005
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:36,426
Oh, now you know Iï¿½m not that kind of girl.

1006
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:47,753
Do you want me to go?

1007
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:53,380
Rory, do you want me to go?

1008
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:54,122
No.

1009
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:57,866
Okay, ï¿½cause if you think climbing in that window was hard ï¿½

1010
00:42:57,977 --> 00:42:58,808
Shh.
