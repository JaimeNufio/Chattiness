1
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:06,408
Hey.

2
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:07,449
What?

3
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:10,607
Make an occasional noise so I know
you didn't pull an Elvis.

4
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:12,942
Just putting the finishing
touches on the face.

5
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:16,343
You're an infant. Hit yourself with a
giant powder puff and get out here.

6
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:17,640
I love this bathroom.

7
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:20,071
Uh, too much! I need the sink.

8
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:22,376
You need my sink? What about the other sink?

9
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:25,366
Oh! I forgot I had two sinks!

10
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:26,589
Well, you do.

11
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:30,238
Look at this. Two sinks. I'm so decadent.

12
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:32,515
I could brush my teeth over this
one and spit into that one.

13
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:35,775
This is now my official favorite
room in the whole world.

14
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,315
Besides the Reading Room
at the British Museum.

15
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:41,675
But add a dome ceiling and ten million books
and you've got yourself a horse race.

16
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:43,353
Paul Anka loves this room too.

17
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:46,651
You ever hear that tape of him chewing
out his band after a show?

18
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:50,576
'When I move, I slice like a hammer!
The guys get shirts!'

19
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:51,863
That's the human Paul Anka.

20
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,891
I don't believe the canine version exists.

21
00:00:53,982 --> 00:00:56,327
He is just laying low until he figures out
you're not going to break his heart

22
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,065
or eat his pig's ears or something.

23
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,179
Well, the chicken's got to show
his face so I can prove myself.

24
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:01,639
So, what all do you have going on today?

25
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,276
Oh, she's already got a list going.

26
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:07,724
Follow up calls to Yale to make sure
I'm all set up for spring semester,

27
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:09,111
four hours of community service -

28
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:12,705
I'm going to try to stretch it to five
because I am tantalizingly
close to being done -

29
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,762
my engine light was on,
but I already took care of that -

30
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:15,529
This morning?

31
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:17,274
Got to Gypsy's shop before it opened.

32
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:19,471
There was only one other annoying
early bird ahead of me,

33
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:22,648
but I bribed Gypsy with a pack of
Rolo's and she took me first.

34
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:23,926
She is such a Rolo whore.

35
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,486
I've got tons of e-mails to return, and, oh,

36
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:28,980
I've got to get the Eagle-Gazette
a bunch of stuff I've written.

37
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,841
Okay. Don't forget to sleep,
daughter of mine.

38
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:34,931
And, uh, I've got to unpack and organize
everything and that's it, for now.

39
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:37,710
Okay, but you will have to leave
the bathroom to do all that.

40
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,560
Mm, reluctantly. See you downstairs.

41
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,415
Okay.

42
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,721
Hey, you have time to eat and
hang out with me, don't you?

43
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,893
Is that on your microscopic
little list there?

44
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,409
I've timed out the rest
of the morning for you.

45
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:48,270
Good girl!

46
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:49,173
Oh! Oh, my God!

47
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:49,653
What?

48
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:50,221
Come down here!

49
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,206
I'm coming!

50
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,121
What?

51
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:55,479
He has emerged.
I'm assuming that's Paul Anka.

52
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:56,601
Well, it ain't Louis Prima.

53
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:58,051
Shoo! Shoo!

54
00:01:58,147 --> 00:01:58,812
What are you doing?

55
00:01:58,852 --> 00:01:59,996
He shouldn't be on the table.

56
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:01,538
That's his favorite spot.
What are you going to do next,

57
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,189
tell him he can't drink
out of my water glass?

58
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:04,754
Sorry. How should I approach him?

59
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:05,494
Follow me.

60
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,700
'Kay.

61
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:09,571
Okay, stop.

62
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:11,439
Now go in the kitchen and
put sugar on your toes.

63
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,057
What?

64
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:15,424
And quickly! Because first impressions are
crucial and you're blowing it big time.

65
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:16,270
Sugar on my toes?

66
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,809
Yes, he loves sugar,
so the first time you come close to him,

67
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:21,335
if you've got sugar on your toes that
he can lick and enjoy, you're in.

68
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:22,127
He's going to lick it?

69
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,499
- Go, quick!
- Okay.

70
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:31,315
Wet your toes first so it sticks!

71
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,059
What?

72
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,732
Dry sugar on a dry toe isn't going to work!

73
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:36,165
Oh, jeez.

74
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:41,389
I'm making a mess.

75
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,751
Don't worry about the mess!

76
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:44,058
We're going to have ants!

77
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:44,892
Hurry!

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,041
I'm coming!

79
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,578
Okay, my toes are all sugared.

80
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:53,304
Okay, good! Now do the hokey-pokey
and turn yourself around.

81
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:53,998
What?

82
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:55,764
All you have to do is pet him and you're in!

83
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:56,556
You're evil.

84
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,590
Yes, I am.

85
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,771
Hey, there, boy!

86
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,331
Oh, that tickles!

87
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:02,769
Well, he's glad you're here!

88
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:04,318
Wait a minute, you're here!

89
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:05,438
I know!

90
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:06,424
Wait right there.

91
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:07,632
Is this another trick?

92
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:11,127
No, I'm just getting something.

93
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,825
You're pulling out the Bop-it?
You're already that bored of me?

94
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:17,236
No. I just accidentally hit the Bop-it
while I was getting this.

95
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:18,030
You bought me a hat?

96
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,914
No, it's a hat box, filled with these.

97
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:23,549
These are notes, written on whatever
I had on hand at the time.

98
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:26,511
Any time I had a topic I
wanted to share with you

99
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:29,520
or a random thought during that
crappy time apart of ours,

100
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:33,030
I jotted it down and threw it in the
hat box so I wouldn't forget.

101
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,658
Really?

102
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:34,775
I missed you, kid.

103
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,860
Missed you too.

104
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,493
So, hit me with 'em!

105
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,791
While we walk to Luke's. Come on.

106
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,958
Some of these are pretty cryptic.

107
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:43,378
Um, Lenny Kravitz - where did Lenny Kravitz -

108
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,043
Get all his money? Yes!

109
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:47,265
One hit and he's buying
a Fifth Avenue mansion.

110
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:49,651
Maybe he went through Nicole Kidman's
wallet when she wasn't looking.

111
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:50,964
That's got to be it.

112
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,178
Computer MP down
- oh. I want to download music.

113
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,721
There's so much out there.
Can you help me figure that out? MP3 players?

114
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:57,998
I can do that. Next?

115
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,382
Eh, Kirk skeet shooting.

116
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:01,527
That's a bad combination.

117
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,855
Yeah, it's the first time the town church has
taken gunfire since the eighteenth century.

118
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:06,271
I missed so much so quickly!

119
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:02,753
Okay. Babette - cats.

120
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:03,896
- Death?
- No.

121
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:05,254
- Adopted another one?
- No.

122
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:06,146
What?

123
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:10,084
Recorded their meows, did some editing and
cut a record of them singing Ring of Fire.

124
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,020
Well, that goes straight
to the top of my charts.

125
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,613
Oh, I started reading Beowulf,
that new translation you recommended.

126
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,903
The Seamus Heaney? Good for you.

127
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:19,828
Yeah. And stopped reading Beowulf,
jotted on the same slip three minutes later.

128
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,317
Well, you gave it the old college try.

129
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:24,575
Oh, this is a new one!
Kirk's got a new hobby. He's doing -

130
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:25,565
Doing Tai Chi?

131
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:26,268
How'd you know that?

132
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:27,429
Because he's doing it right there.

133
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,938
Is it possible for him to do something
without looking a little silly?

134
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:31,206
He wouldn't be Kirk then.

135
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,830
Bendleshnitz?

136
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:34,749
That's not English.

137
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:37,038
I know. I'll add it to the ones
that I can't make out.

138
00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:40,302
And - brazzlefrat.

139
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:41,440
Another unreadable one.

140
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:43,552
They're stacking up! Okay.

141
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:45,890
Now wait out here.

142
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:46,917
Why?

143
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:49,354
It's a thing. A moment thing. Just wait here.

144
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:50,141
Okay.

145
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:52,484
Hey!

146
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,655
- You ready?
- For what?

147
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:56,615
For this!
The moment you've all been waiting for!

148
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:58,444
Brrrr!

149
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,886
- What's that?
- It's a drum roll.

150
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:00,996
It sounded more like a helicopter.

151
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,794
Well, it's a drum roll, go with it, okay?

152
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:05,086
Ladies and gentlemen, Rory Gilmore!

153
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:05,686
Hi Luke!

154
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:07,355
Hey, Rory, you're back!

155
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,139
I'm back!

156
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,732
You look good. Healthy, happy.

157
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,625
Huh, here with your mom, both of you here.

158
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:14,139
Yeah, it's great, you know!

159
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,289
Yay!

160
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:18,575
I don't think I've ever said 'yay' before.
Sounded weird.

161
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:19,097
A little.

162
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,311
Come, sit, sit.

163
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,394
What was that sound you were making?

164
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:22,193
A drum roll!

165
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,597
It sounded like a helicopter or something.

166
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:24,446
That's what I said.

167
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,381
Has no one heard a drum roll before?

168
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,114
Hey, I saved you the best table
in case you showed up.

169
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,713
In case? It was mandatory.

170
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:34,524
What can I get you? Ah, never mind.
I'm going to bring you everything you like.

171
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:35,316
I know what you like.

172
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:35,889
Sounds good.

173
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,508
Oh, hey! You were with me when I wrote this.

174
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:38,611
Uh, what does it say?

175
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,030
Oh, this is from that stupid Mexican
restaurant we went to.

176
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:43,691
Right. I wrote something on the other side.

177
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:44,843
Man, this place stunk!

178
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,661
I know, but read the back, there.
I've got to know what it says.

179
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:48,794
Look what we paid! Unbelievable.

180
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:51,643
Downright usurious!
Now look at the other side, there.
The brazzelfrat?

181
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:54,133
They did charge me for that second beer!
I never got it.

182
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:55,475
Scandalous. But the other side.

183
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,037
Six bucks for guacamole.

184
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:58,752
Oh, just bring me what she's having.

185
00:06:58,874 --> 00:06:59,562
Coming right up.

186
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:03,037
So, Luke, wait!
You haven't told me anything about yourself.
What's new with you?

187
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,286
With me? Uh, nothing.

188
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,006
We're engaged, your mom and me.

189
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:08,824
I know that, but anything else?

190
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,651
No. No, why?

191
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:11,411
Just wondering.

192
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,067
What have you heard?

193
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:13,270
Nothing. That's why I'm asking.

194
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:15,702
Well, there's your answer. Nothing.
Nothing's new.

195
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:17,739
I'm going to go put in your order, okay?

196
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,479
Sure.

197
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:19,761
We'll be waiting hungrily!

198
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,105
Did I inadvertently step
into something there?

199
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:23,095
No idea.

200
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:26,479
Mother and daughter, together again,
and all is right with the world.

201
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:27,955
- Hi, Lorelai.
- Hi, Lane.

202
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,907
So. Next Wednesday night, I need you.
Tell me you're not busy.

203
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:32,024
I'm not sure, why?

204
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:35,062
We're doing a showcase. Me and the band.
Not a gig, a showcase.

205
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:37,205
And a label's going to be there.

206
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:40,324
I'm shaking! I shouldn't shake,
I'm a drummer! It'll mess up the beat.

207
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:42,454
But, my God, we're playing for a label.

208
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,984
Wow! Lane, I'm absolutely there. This is big!

209
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:49,027
Very big. Unless it's a 'Waiting for Guffman'
thing and the label guys don't show up.

210
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,352
Did I just jinx it?

211
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,284
I don't know.
Let's do that un-jinxing thing we used to do,
just in case.

212
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:53,909
Good.

213
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:57,816
Jinx back, double pinkie, round the side,
double pinkie, jinx back.

214
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,502
Hey, I want to do that!

215
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,524
It's a serious thing, Mom!
You don't just do it.

216
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:02,354
Sorry.

217
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,015
Well, Lane,
you guys are so prepared for this.

218
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:07,450
That tape you gave me of your
new stuff was awesome!

219
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:10,909
Hey, what if I jinx it!
Do I get to do the un-jinxing thing then?

220
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:14,319
If we jinx-back a second time within the
hour, it cancels out the first jinx-back.

221
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:14,773
Sorry.

222
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,279
So, what were your favorites on the tape?

223
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,311
Well, 'Melissa' was catchy,
and 'Colleen Francine'.

224
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:24,327
But that other one - 'Rebecca in the
morning'? That was my favorite.

225
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:25,352
Mine too!

226
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,016
Zach's into songs with girl's names, huh?

227
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:29,027
He thinks that's our best shot at radio play.

228
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:31,641
Worked for the Police, the Knack,
Franz Ferdinand.

229
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:32,376
Good thinking.

230
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,444
Hey. Do you want to be our DA Pennebaker?

231
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,399
We're borrowing a video camera, and we need
someone sober to do the photography.

232
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:39,342
I could set my crack pipe aside
for the night and do that.

233
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,276
Thanks!

234
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,428
You plus one, right?

235
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:42,029
Plus one?

236
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:42,875
You plus Logan?

237
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,503
No. Just me.

238
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,395
Oh, okay. How about you, Lorelai?

239
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:49,863
Working that night, sweetie, but break a leg.
Does that get me a hand thingy?

240
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:50,415
No.

241
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:51,176
Rats.

242
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:52,171
See you guys.

243
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,650
So, just you, huh?

244
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:54,429
Just me.

245
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:55,211
Okay!

246
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:56,304
As long as you're prying -

247
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:57,124
I wasn't.

248
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,460
Briefly, succinctly,
Logan and I are not talking right now.

249
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:01,072
Ah.

250
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:03,457
We had a fight. A big one, in public.

251
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:04,013
Oops.

252
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:06,445
I think we just needed a little break,
a least I did.

253
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:07,902
It's more like a hiatus.

254
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,734
Well, sometimes a break is good.

255
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:10,721
Sometimes.

256
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:13,387
Food. First wave only.

257
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,056
Second wave, five minutes.

258
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:15,894
Let's dig in.

259
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:19,044
I hope it's not cold.

260
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,909
Oops, I think I jinxed it!

261
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:26,628
Jinx back, double pinkie, round the side,
double pinkie, jinx back.

262
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:27,465
Woo!

263
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:30,342
Okay, where's the onions for my sauce?
Who's my onion man?

264
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:31,074
Right here, Sookie.

265
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:34,103
Okay, right here, Carl.
I need them right there. Okay?

266
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,791
Get the shallots in it. It's time. It's time!

267
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:40,579
Okay. Needs more garlic. Come on.
Godfather it up for me.

268
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,655
Good! Good, good, good. Good, good.

269
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,723
Okay. If you can travel back
in time and make me not make

270
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,812
the veal and ham pate, I'd appreciate it.

271
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,304
Talk me out of these things
in the future, guys.

272
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,683
- Hello!
- Hello!

273
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,397
Could you step away from the pan, please?

274
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,158
Honey, do you see a joystick?
This is not a game. Okay?

275
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:58,205
It's a heche sauce and it's for keeps!

276
00:09:58,305 --> 00:09:59,119
Put it down!

277
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:00,551
Okay! What?

278
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:01,990
Okay!

279
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:06,916
Oh, my God!

280
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:08,087
Hi Sookie!

281
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:09,444
You're here!

282
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:12,325
You're with us! Oh, look, I missed you!

283
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,314
I missed you!

284
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:15,680
This means you can set a wedding date.
No impediments!

285
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,320
Yeah. I already told Luke.

286
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,148
Hyperventilating!

287
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:21,114
Hyperventilating!

288
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:25,694
I was just working on my list of
what to make for Thanksgiving

289
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:30,160
and I was wishing you were going
to be here and now you are!

290
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:35,670
Oh my God! What if what I'm wishing
for is actually coming true?

291
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:38,426
Quick! Wish for a Sephora to be
built within walking distance.

292
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:39,767
Do you need a paper bag?

293
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,220
I'm good, I'm good. Just happy.

294
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:44,824
Rory!

295
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,741
Oh, hi! Wow, Michel.

296
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:48,350
Hi.

297
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:49,874
Boy, that was weird.

298
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:52,702
She just surprised me, that's all.

299
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:54,695
It's kind of okay that you are here.

300
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:56,539
It's kind of okay with me too.

301
00:10:56,717 --> 00:10:57,584
- Lunch!
- What?

302
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:59,864
Lunch! I'm making you lunch!

303
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:01,133
- But we just -
- Don't fight it.

304
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,044
It just came to me. Kebabs.

305
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:08,133
Okay, drop everything, boys!
We're making kebabs for Rory,
and pot stickers!

306
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,264
Okay, throw everything out.
This is a celebration! Woo!

307
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:12,387
Let's get to higher ground.

308
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,339
Okay, we're opening with Melissa,
closing with Dear Maureen.

309
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,784
Those are great bookends,
it's the middle part that's screwing us up.

310
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,837
Aw, man, I wish we had one more ballad.

311
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,631
I'm half finished with one,
but it's not going to be ready in time.

312
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:28,472
# I saw her, in the mist she came walking by,
Stella #

313
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,289
# Now a blur,
made a list of what I like about her,
Stella #

314
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:35,034
Cool!

315
00:11:35,138 --> 00:11:38,009
Yeah! It's got a nice Fountains
of Wayne meets the Shins

316
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:39,961
crossed with Odyssey-era Zombies,

317
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:43,170
and a mix of early Who and mid-to-late-era
Replacements vibe to it.

318
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,927
Well, that's what I was going for.

319
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:46,863
Still hunting for that middle eight,
you know?

320
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,583
So, um, it's called Stella?

321
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,084
Yeah, I guess. Didn't you like it?

322
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:52,933
No, it's good. It's just
- it's another girl's name.

323
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:53,401
So?

324
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:56,367
If he were singing about dudes, I'd be out
the door before you could say 'See ya'!

325
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,845
Look, Lane, you know how I write.

326
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,101
I think about people that I've known
and I draw inspiration from that.

327
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,423
I know, it's just, no big deal or anything,

328
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:05,732
but have you ever thought to write one about,
I don't know, a girl named Lane?

329
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:08,013
Well, Lane just isn't that great
of a name for a song.

330
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,688
But you've already got one called Lorraine.

331
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:12,590
Lorraine is pretty much Lane with
an extra syllable thrown in.

332
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,360
True, but nothing rhymes with Lane.

333
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:16,478
I'm sorry,
but a million things rhyme with Lane.

334
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,389
Yeah, rain. Pain. All cliché stuff.

335
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:20,348
You're not a writer.

336
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:22,750
I think you could come up with non-cliché
stuff to rhyme with Lane.

337
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:25,651
Wait, maybe I could write one about your
Korean name. What was that again?

338
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,743
Hyung-hyung?

339
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:27,870
O for two.

340
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,854
Look, it's not your fault.
You didn't pick your name, your mom did.

341
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:31,969
Right. I didn't pick it.

342
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,904
Okay, so. Where were we?

343
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,642
Oh. Lorraine. Where should Lorraine go?

344
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,017
Try it after Rebecca.

345
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:39,699
It's not as good a transition as going
from Rebecca to Linda Marie.

346
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:41,029
True is true.

347
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:43,227
Man. I wish Stella was ready.

348
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,539
Three days.

349
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,901
Three days he had the hiccups.

350
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:49,863
Poor Paul Anka.

351
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:52,327
And by sneaking up on him
to scare them out of him,

352
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:54,677
he jumped so high, his head split my lip.

353
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:55,784
See the red? My blood.

354
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,530
Yuck.

355
00:12:56,671 --> 00:13:01,041
Oh. Um, here's a non-fun one.
Just to mix it up a little.

356
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:01,930
What?

357
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:03,235
Your dad called.

358
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:07,057
Wow. It's been, like a year, hasn't it?
When did he call?

359
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,835
The very worst possible time.

360
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,107
He's got a knack for that.

361
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,744
I didn't talk to him. He left a message,

362
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,767
some of which Luke overheard
and it freaked him out.

363
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:14,954
That's understandable.

364
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:18,276
And we argued, see? Arguing's not
just for the younger demographic.

365
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,010
Nice to know.

366
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:20,458
But then we made up and we had a good talk

367
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,468
and then I listened to the rest of
Christopher's message and he wants to see me.

368
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:25,213
Why?

369
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,925
He didn't say. He sounded very chipper.

370
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:31,274
He said he had something very important to
discuss with me, and that it wasn't a trick,

371
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:35,929
and that it was an absolute one hundred
percent positive thing for me and for you.

372
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:37,132
For both of us.

373
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:41,320
Meaning there's a ninety-nine and ninety-nine
one hundredths percent
chance that it won't be.

374
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,464
I guess so.

375
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:43,613
So what should I do?

376
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:44,547
You could ignore him.

377
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,805
That's dangerous, too.

378
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,164
It's a slippery slope with Dad.

379
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:48,362
What could it be about?

380
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:51,838
I mean, he wouldn't dare be in cahoots with
Emily and Richard on something, would he?

381
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:52,775
He's not that dumb.

382
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,108
Yeah, but he's vulnerable.
They prey on the weak.

383
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,892
But he said it's something positive.
It couldn't involve them.

384
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:59,539
Maybe he's getting back
together with his wife.

385
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,236
Well, that's not technically good
news for us, it's just news.

386
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:03,754
Maybe it's about Gigi.

387
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,296
Maybe he's discovered she's a prodigy.

388
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:08,168
Maybe he's calling to invite us to
her premiere at Carnegie Hall.

389
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:09,193
Playing what instrument?

390
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:10,158
The flugle horn.

391
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:12,897
She's three. We would have read
about it in the paper by now.

392
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:16,091
'Freakishly talented three-year-old
flugle horn prodigy discovered'.

393
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,960
It would be very positive news.

394
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:19,580
Hm. Well, I'm out.

395
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:20,634
Me too.

396
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,108
Oh. I guess there's only one way to find out.

397
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,307
Guess so.

398
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,205
Brazzlefrat.

399
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,364
Bendleschnitz.

400
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:32,669
Thank you so much, big brother.
What a godsend you are.

401
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:36,104
Yeah.
God sent me to help you and now he must pay.

402
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:39,370
You know, I've never made dinner
for twelve people before.

403
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,317
Actually I've never made dinner before.

404
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:44,564
See, I'm making rolls for my thanksgiving
dinner tomorrow,

405
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,636
and I just don't have the oven space.

406
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:47,340
Or the oven.

407
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,493
Just hurry, Liz.

408
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:51,630
See, I've got a convection
oven and a microwave,

409
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:54,089
and that's going to take
care of everything else.

410
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,434
See, I'm a student of Martha.
You know Martha Stewart?

411
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:57,507
She's a genius.

412
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,206
Don't bother the customers, Liz.

413
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,556
You know, they're all Renaissance Fair
people coming to this thing, Luke.

414
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,390
You know some of them.

415
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:03,871
Goody.

416
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:06,145
Larry with the 'Kill 'em
all' tattoo on his face,

417
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:07,863
and Freddy, the guy who doesn't have thumbs.

418
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,031
Don't tell me, he's hitch hiking in.

419
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:11,995
You're funny.

420
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:15,246
Really, Luke,
I'm calling you Yakov from now on!

421
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,193
Just try not to be too intrusive,
please, Liz?

422
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:19,611
Yes, sir!

423
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:24,467
Hey, that's fun!

424
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:27,259
Okay.
This is not what I call not being intrusive.

425
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:28,382
Okay, I know this.

426
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:33,077
Two 'not's is a double negative which
makes it a positive, and -

427
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:35,224
you know what, this is where I always
lose my train of thought.

428
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:36,290
You're intruding.

429
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,633
Is this one roll? It's crazy!

430
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:43,551
You separate 'em.

431
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:46,043
Oh, boy. My carpal tunnel.

432
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,488
That's going to make doing this impossible.

433
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:50,430
Hey, do you mind giving me a hand?

434
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:52,267
No, you don't have to do that!

435
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,492
Yes, I do.

436
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,027
If you insist.

437
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,625
I'll, uh, grab me a cup of coffee.

438
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:03,132
So, Sophie, you've done, like,
big show gigs before playing the piano.
Any advice?

439
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:04,724
Don't wear a clown suit.

440
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:05,752
Thanks.

441
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:07,583
Still got my eye on this beauty.

442
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:09,506
Just don't put your hand on it.

443
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:11,803
Maybe I'll splurge and get it.
You take MasterCard?

444
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:12,992
Why, you got one?

445
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:14,936
Just waiting to hear back on the application.

446
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:15,989
Keep moving.

447
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:18,369
Oh! Cool! We should all get these.

448
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,397
Wireless mikes?

449
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:20,648
Isn't that too Gwen Stefani?

450
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:23,457
Not if we wear 'em.
It'll be totally Peter Gabriel.

451
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:31,188
Hey, dude. That doesn't sound too bad.
What is it?

452
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:33,631
Oh, just a song I've been working on.
I don't know if it's any good or not.

453
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,045
Chords are good. Any lyrics?

454
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,615
Some. It's called Lane.

455
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:37,969
It's called Lane?

456
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:38,849
Who, me, Lane?

457
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:42,213
Yeah. We were talking about songs and Lane
yesterday and I just got inspired.

458
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:43,221
Inspired, huh?

459
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,359
That's nice! Thanks, Brian!

460
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,622
Doesn't make me want to be violently ill.

461
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:48,408
High praise.

462
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:50,099
Yeah! Thanks, Sophie!

463
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:51,603
We can learn it next week.

464
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,099
Look, we came to get picks.
Let's get picks, okay?

465
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:05,577
Lorelai. Over here.

466
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,407
I snagged the best table in the house.

467
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,299
You slip the guy a buck?

468
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,219
I had to get my fifty cents change. Hey.

469
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:12,094
Hey, Chris.

470
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:15,749
I don't know how you do it, I mean,
you always look -

471
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,074
Yeah, well, I get the girls from
the Wash & Brush Up company

472
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,821
from the Wizard of Oz working for me now.

473
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:20,772
Good deal.

474
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,473
So, uh, how's our Rory?

475
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:28,947
Oh, she's good. She's, um, you know. Great.
Very busy.

476
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:29,888
As per usual.

477
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:31,735
She took a little time off Yale.

478
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:34,168
And the Apocalypse is this week? Next week?

479
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:37,726
She's back there and she's thriving.
She'll be running the world one day.

480
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:38,427
You sure?

481
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:39,865
She's doing great. Trust me.

482
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:40,828
I do.

483
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:42,920
So?

484
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,866
So.

485
00:17:44,004 --> 00:17:44,869
What's going on?

486
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,613
Wouldn't you like to know?

487
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:47,459
Christopher.

488
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,359
This is the funnest thing I've got to
do in years. Years! All right?
Let me, let me savor it.

489
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,284
Come on! Tell me. What?

490
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,312
My grandfather died.

491
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,149
Um, that's fun how?

492
00:17:57,256 --> 00:18:00,946
Well, that's not the fun part.
The old man was ninety eight, long life,
great life.

493
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:04,139
His last words were an inappropriate
pass at the nurse tending to him.

494
00:18:04,226 --> 00:18:05,738
Pretty good one, too.
I made a mental note of it.

495
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,868
So your grandfather died.

496
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:11,390
Well, the old guy was actually pretty cool,
and for some reason he always liked me.

497
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:14,378
And he was the Hayden with the purse strings.

498
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:15,971
Long story short,

499
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:17,737
I'm rich.

500
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:19,059
You're rich!

501
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:22,902
Ridiculously. I mean,
I'm not Bill Gates by a long shot,
but I've got money!

502
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,252
Can you stand it?

503
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,034
Good, Chris. That's good.

504
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:27,435
And I want to share it.

505
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:31,282
I've set Gigi up with funds for private
nursery school and prep school

506
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:35,204
and college and grad school and post-grad
school and PhD school

507
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,684
and a wedding and a divorce if she wants it,

508
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:40,251
and another wedding or she
can buy a bunch of cats

509
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:43,563
and a lifetime supply of Twizzlers
and popcorn if that's her choice.

510
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,193
But she's all set, and...

511
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:49,284
now I want to take care of you. You and Rory.

512
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:51,928
Oh. Oh, Chris, I don't know what to say.

513
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,924
What do you want? A car? How about a Bentley?
They're pretty sweet.

514
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:58,635
Or a new house?
Or a tract of land to build a new house?

515
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,107
I can do that. I can buy you a tract.

516
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,756
Christopher -

517
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:03,741
Or is there someone you hate that you'd like
to say 'I can buy and sell you' to?

518
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:05,585
Because you can have the funds
to make that happen.

519
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:08,374
You can crush people with money.
You want some people-crushing money?

520
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:09,724
Oh, Chris, slow down, here.

521
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:11,362
Come on, everybody needs something!

522
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:13,291
Including you. Don't forget yourself.

523
00:19:13,394 --> 00:19:16,037
Ah, I bought a new bike,
I bought a giant audio system. I'm done.

524
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:17,365
What else do I want? Nothing.

525
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,863
Buy yourself a tract of land.

526
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,738
Come on. Let me give you something.

527
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:23,907
A castle in Ireland? A Civil War cannon.

528
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:27,583
A brewery. Yeah! Buy a brewery!
That would be cool!
You could brew your own beer!

529
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:30,758
You know, I had a brewery for a while,
but I couldn't stand the smell of hops.

530
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:35,170
Pay off something. Your house.
Outstanding bills. Your bookie. Something.

531
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:37,543
Pay off Yale. Pay off your back taxes.

532
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:39,019
I don't owe any back taxes.

533
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:40,131
Oh, right, that's me.

534
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:44,638
Look, Chris, you're very nice to offer,
and I love that you're so excited about it.

535
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:46,458
It's great to see you like this.

536
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,002
But I'm fine.

537
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:50,693
You're too un-materialistic. You know,
I've always thought that.

538
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:54,014
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll talk to Rory.
See if she wants a brewery or a Bentley.

539
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:55,620
Or a castle! Don't forget the castle.

540
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:56,704
I'll mention the castle.

541
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:57,918
And it doesn't have to be in Ireland.

542
00:19:58,024 --> 00:20:00,730
It can be in Germany,
Czech Republic, Scotland, Narnia.

543
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:01,863
I'll leave nothing out.

544
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,710
Okay. So, you hungry?

545
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:04,337
A little.

546
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,253
Eh, let's eat.

547
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,239
I'm paying for lunch!

548
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,407
This is the first club I ever went to.

549
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:14,702
I was underage and snuck in and saw
Granddaddy in one of their first concerts.

550
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:15,560
Cool.

551
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:17,646
I remember once throwing up in that corner,

552
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:19,780
and some dude slipped in and
had to go to the hospital,

553
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:23,451
and I stole the chick he was with and shacked
up with her for like a week and a half.

554
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:24,766
Another fun memory.

555
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,748
How about it, guys?
You about ready to do this?

556
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:28,092
Just a few more minutes, Gary.

557
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:28,997
Where's Zach?

558
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:30,672
I don't know. He's coming separately.

559
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:31,744
Here he is.

560
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:33,218
Where you been, man?

561
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:34,837
What? Are we punching time cards now?

562
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:36,135
You almost missed sound check!

563
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:38,811
Well, almost means I didn't miss it.
Just set up your amp, okay?

564
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:39,711
Whatever.

565
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:41,532
But not there. I'm not liking the setup here.

566
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:43,121
This is how we always set up.

567
00:20:43,223 --> 00:20:44,964
That's why it looks stale.
Do you want it to look stale?

568
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,041
No, we don't want that!

569
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:47,650
We're going to need room
for the new guy, too.

570
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:48,223
New guy?

571
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,023
What new guy?

572
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,663
Hey, Joel! Come over here, buddy.

573
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,567
This is Joel.
He's going to sit in on tambourine.

574
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:53,374
How you doing?

575
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:55,957
Good, Joel. Um, we added a new guy?

576
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,110
On tambourine?

577
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,171
He's going to fill out our sound.

578
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:01,602
But the only reason to have a tambourine
is if it's being played by a hot chick.

579
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:03,643
No offense, Joel, but you're not a hot chick.

580
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:06,982
Yo! Gary! See this? Remember it. It's mine.

581
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:09,442
I don't want it sucked into the club's
gear when I'm not looking.

582
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:10,959
What, the Gwen Stefani mike?

583
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:13,252
It's not a Gwen Stefani mike.
And don't take it.

584
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,523
You bought that mike?

585
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,460
It means I can crowd surf.
The audience loves that.

586
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,828
They do. They love crowd surfing. Dig.

587
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:21,097
Figure I'll stage side right
after our guitar solo.

588
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:22,982
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

589
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,633
What is wrong with you?

590
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:26,991
Nothing. Why?

591
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:29,417
You added a band member without telling us?

592
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,754
Well, it's my band, right?

593
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:33,307
Uh, no, actually,
we're supposed to be a democracy.

594
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:34,395
Is this coming from Brian?

595
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:37,412
No, it's coming from me! I'm just
- concerned.

596
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:38,569
Well don't be.

597
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,323
And don't be a huge mega bummer before
our big show. That's not cool.

598
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:43,759
Okay, I'm sorry.

599
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:55,960
Hello?

600
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:56,840
Hey, it's me.

601
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,644
Who's me?

602
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,194
Oh my God.
You don't recognize your best friend's voice.

603
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:02,122
Sorry, Paris. There's noise here.

604
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,420
So, I'm returning your call.

605
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:05,171
Thanks! I just wanted to tell you something.

606
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,460
Brrrr! I'm coming back to Yale!

607
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:09,848
What was that sound?

608
00:22:10,044 --> 00:22:11,006
That was a drum roll.

609
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:13,587
You really had to drum roll that?
Of course you're coming back.

610
00:22:13,673 --> 00:22:16,000
What are you going to do without a
college degree? Drive a forklift?

611
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:19,602
Well, I was calling to ask you if you
could keep your eyes and ears open

612
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,940
for a place for me to live.

613
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,598
Mid-year like this, it's going to be tough.

614
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:25,658
I'm not picky. Plus I want to come back
to the Yale Daily News. That's a given.

615
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,986
Where are you right now, by the way?

616
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:28,771
I'm here. At the Daily News.

617
00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:29,692
By yourself?

618
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,909
No, everyone's here.
I just like a super-quiet atmosphere.

619
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:36,803
No extraneous talking, and I've even
had the computer keyboards deadened.

620
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:38,771
So they're getting no break for Thanksgiving?

621
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:41,837
I put up a fold-out paper turkey
and I laid out some Oscar Meyer.

622
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,233
Nice.

623
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:45,404
Well, keep an eye out for
a place for me, okay?

624
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:46,419
Will do. See you.

625
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:47,661
Thanks. Bye.

626
00:22:48,644 --> 00:22:53,439
So?
No sign of crying or hair being pulled out.
The thing with Dad went okay?

627
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:55,806
It was fine. He was telling the truth.

628
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:57,753
There was nothing too horrible.
Except for the frings.

629
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:58,329
The what?

630
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:01,957
Oh, the combo basket of fries and onion
rings. Good in theory, but -

631
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:03,195
So what did he want to talk to you about?

632
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:06,101
Well, his grandfather died.

633
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:07,055
Oh.

634
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:09,939
Apparently it was one of those un-sad deaths.
Like Buddy Hackett.

635
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:11,633
No-one was sad about Buddy Hackett?

636
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,972
No one I saw on the news.

637
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:15,873
Anyway, he left Chris money. A lot of money.

638
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,255
And now he's offering to shower us with it.

639
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:19,067
You want a Bentley?

640
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:20,001
I don't think so.

641
00:23:20,093 --> 00:23:20,767
How about a castle?

642
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:21,897
What would I do with a castle?

643
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:23,348
I'm simply relaying the offer.

644
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:24,819
Dad should keep the money for himself.

645
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:27,183
Are you sure there's nothing you want?
A brewery, a Faberge egg,

646
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:32,177
or let's see, what else did he mention?
Um, paying for Yale through a PhD,
uh, vacations,

647
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:35,832
a cannon from the Civil War - functioning,
by the way, so it's not just show.

648
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,644
It seemed like the sky was the limit,
although he didn't mention the Hoover Dam,

649
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:40,921
so maybe there is a cap of some sort.

650
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:43,493
Actually, I think maybe there
is something I'd want.

651
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,475
Really? Okay, what?

652
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,566
I would maybe let him pay for Yale.

653
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:48,592
Seriously?

654
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:49,642
Yeah.

655
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:50,407
Wow.

656
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:51,565
Unless it's too much.

657
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,799
I think it was the cheapest of
all the things he mentioned.

658
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:56,126
It's just that there would
be residual benefits.

659
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:58,051
It would get me out from under
Grandma and Grandpa's thumb,

660
00:23:58,133 --> 00:23:59,498
which sounds really good to me right now.

661
00:23:59,597 --> 00:24:01,343
Well. I can't say I don't relate.

662
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,260
I don't want them to be holding anything over
my head. I don't want to owe them anything.

663
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,953
There's too much pressure. Too much expected.

664
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,619
There are too many strings with these people.

665
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,143
Okay. I'm getting very uncomfortable

666
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:13,060
with the Freaky Friday moment
we've got going on here,

667
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,313
'cause it means I have to go to Yale,
you have to run the inn,

668
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:19,169
and oh, God, I don't even like thinking
about what it would mean for Luke.

669
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:21,111
It's feeling better by the second, this idea.

670
00:24:21,213 --> 00:24:24,410
You do understand,
you'd basically be cutting Mom and Dad off.

671
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,135
You don't know what it was
like to be living there.

672
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,313
Hello, oppressed one, class of eighty-five!

673
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,107
But you got out.

674
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:31,700
No, no. You were only there for three months.
You're not in my league.

675
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:33,053
We can't swap war stories yet.

676
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:36,660
They had their Reverend come over
to talk me out of having sex.

677
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:37,800
They never did that to you.

678
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,935
Five times they did that to me!

679
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,483
The last time they triple-teamed me with a
priest, a rabbi and a Mormon missionary.

680
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:45,196
I made so many jokes that night,

681
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,148
I should have had a microphone
and a brick wall behind me.

682
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:50,956
And I never got a forty thousand
dollar sex house.

683
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:51,599
A what?

684
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:52,605
You don't want to know.

685
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,665
Look. I know it's a slippery slope.
Dad is Dad.

686
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,743
Yes, he is.

687
00:24:57,317 --> 00:24:59,599
But I'm pretty sure I want to do this.

688
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:02,160
Well, if you're sure, you're sure.

689
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,304
We'll call him.

690
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,062
We'll call him.

691
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,160
He's going to be happy!

692
00:25:05,274 --> 00:25:06,159
Not as happy as me.

693
00:25:06,258 --> 00:25:07,009
Good.

694
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:13,774
Hey. Hey!

695
00:25:13,861 --> 00:25:16,446
Wow! You look almost intimidatingly cool.

696
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:17,197
Thanks.

697
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:18,220
Everyone ready?

698
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:20,312
Pretty much,
although sound check was a little weird.

699
00:25:20,405 --> 00:25:21,634
Well, you know what they say.

700
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:23,256
Weird sound check, good gig.

701
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:24,070
Who says that?

702
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:26,257
Well, just me. But I'm hoping it'll catch on.

703
00:25:26,718 --> 00:25:28,210
See those two guys?

704
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:29,975
Those are the label guys.

705
00:25:30,057 --> 00:25:33,676
Oh. I'll be careful not to hurt them
when I start violently slam-dancing.

706
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:34,914
You're going to be great.

707
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,746
Thanks. I should get back there.
We have this pre-show thing we always do.

708
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:39,624
Good luck!

709
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:44,792
Test. Test. Test.

710
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:47,801
Monitor check! Monitor check!

711
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:51,861
Test! Test! Test! Test!
Where'd they get these monitors, the Kremlin?
Test! Test!

712
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,400
It's your wireless mic, dude.
It's not working.

713
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:55,286
Well, did somebody touch it?
Because it was working before.

714
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,125
One minute, guys.

715
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:57,832
Who says one minute? We go on when we go on!

716
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,681
No-one tells Axl Rose when he goes on,
he goes on when he feels like it.

717
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:01,940
You're comparing yourself to Axl Rose?

718
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:03,366
- Don't get in my face, Brian.
- I'm not.

719
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:05,356
Go write some more songs
if you've got a problem.

720
00:26:05,587 --> 00:26:08,329
All right! Welcome to the New Deck!

721
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:10,464
Listen, we're throwing out the set list.

722
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:11,072
What?

723
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:13,331
Keep up. I'm going to be calling
out tunes like Jack White.

724
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,204
But we rehearsed in this order.
We've got transitions.

725
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:17,735
Yeah! REO Speedwagon had transitions, too!

726
00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:20,791
You want to be REO Speedwagon?
We should have brought the smoke machine!

727
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:27,507
We've got a special showcase for you tonight.
Give it up for Connecticut's own Hep Alien!

728
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:29,222
Wait, wait,
we didn't do our lucky pre-show thing!

729
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:30,483
Lane, count it down!

730
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,358
What are we playing?

731
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:32,144
Yeah, what are we playing?

732
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:34,176
Check, one, two, check, check!

733
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:35,308
Dude, what are we playing?

734
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,001
I need to be hotter in the monitor, Gary!
Wake up, dude!

735
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:39,511
Come on, let's start!

736
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:40,937
Hey, I know that guy.

737
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:42,950
We'll start when I'm ready. This is my stage.

738
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,558
Come on, let's do Rebecca.

739
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:46,875
Just hang on,
it's worth waiting around to see the band

740
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,193
that's going to get the biggest
record deal in history.

741
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:52,757
This is pathetic.

742
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,969
You guys suck!

743
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:55,953
Freebird!

744
00:26:56,212 --> 00:26:57,905
Hey! Knock it off.

745
00:26:58,004 --> 00:26:58,451
Knock what off?

746
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,622
You know what you're doing!
Get back to your mike.

747
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:01,839
- Get back!
- Zach!

748
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:02,708
Don't kick him.

749
00:27:02,797 --> 00:27:04,591
Get off my stage if you've got a problem!

750
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:08,506
Nobody's going to tell me what to
do on my stage with my band!

751
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:11,596
Dude, you need to find another place to
stand. I'm not going to tell you again.

752
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:13,220
If he moves, he's going to block Lane.

753
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:14,788
Oh, yeah, you don't want Lane blocked,
do you?

754
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:15,876
Come on!

755
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:17,451
This is a song called Stella.

756
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:18,864
We haven't learned that song!

757
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:19,978
Let's go back to the set list!

758
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,353
No, we're not going to do that. I'm here to
destroy the system so stay out of my way!

759
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:24,491
Hey!

760
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:25,674
And you don't need to -

761
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:59,248
Dude broke my wireless mike.

762
00:28:00,435 --> 00:28:02,287
Zach. What is wrong with you?

763
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:02,895
Nothing.

764
00:28:02,992 --> 00:28:03,747
Nothing?

765
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,424
This was a disaster.
The guys from the label were there!

766
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:08,919
They showed up! It was our shot!

767
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:12,012
We worked so hard to get to this point,
and we blew our big shot!

768
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:14,015
What the hell is wrong with you?

769
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:20,305
You let me down tonight. You let down Gil,
you let down Brian -

770
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:21,728
I don't want to hear about Brian!

771
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:22,872
Zach!

772
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:24,660
This is what it is, okay?

773
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:28,783
Maybe this is why people
in bands shouldn't date.

774
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,440
Yeah.

775
00:28:36,536 --> 00:28:37,643
I guess so.

776
00:28:46,912 --> 00:28:47,704
Hey, guys!

777
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:48,863
Happy Thanksgiving!

778
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:49,699
Hey, Dad!

779
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:50,651
Come here, you.

780
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:53,364
God, I've missed you!

781
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,717
Have you grown? She's grown!

782
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:57,006
Only in my estimation.

783
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:00,050
I, I cannot tell you how jazzed I
am to see you on Thanksgiving!

784
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:02,159
You know,
we've never seen each other on Thanksgiving.

785
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:03,834
- Oh, God, is that true?
- I think so.

786
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:05,052
I know so.

787
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,406
So, uh, what's this about?

788
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,031
I filled Rory in. I mentioned the brewery,
and the castle.

789
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:12,801
- The Oompa Loompas?
- Those too.

790
00:29:12,914 --> 00:29:15,639
And, um - well, you want to take it?

791
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:16,546
Sure.

792
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:22,634
Dad, I - I thought about it,
and Mom and I talked about it,

793
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,236
and I think it would be really great
if you could pay for Yale.

794
00:29:27,323 --> 00:29:30,106
Absolutely, absolutely!
Nothing would make me happier.

795
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:31,566
Good. Thank you.

796
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,469
I am there, I am so there.

797
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,272
That's great.

798
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:35,558
Let me pay for Chilton too.

799
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:37,032
Well, that's already taken care of.

800
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,273
You know, Yale's kind of expensive.

801
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,354
But I'm loaded
- didn't you tell her? I'm loaded!

802
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,256
I told her.

803
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:45,134
So, how do I do this? Do I give you the cash,
or do I pay Yale?

804
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:47,086
Do they take checks or does it
have to be a money order?

805
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:49,721
What is a money order anyway? I mean,
how is it different from a check?

806
00:29:49,785 --> 00:29:52,276
Isn't a check a piece of paper forwarding
money? What's the difference?

807
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:53,370
Whoa, Chris, slow down.

808
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:55,844
This makes me so happy,
I can't tell you, Rory.

809
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:58,991
It means a lot to me, Dad.
This was excellent timing, believe me.

810
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,864
Well, it means more to me.

811
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:04,541
This is the paper in Stamford. Excuse me.

812
00:30:04,632 --> 00:30:06,152
Hey, try to steal a pie on the way out.

813
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:06,979
Okay.

814
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:12,886
Thanks for making this happen, Lor.

815
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:15,287
Hey, it wasn't me. It's what she wanted.

816
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:16,859
Well, thanks for giving her the choice.

817
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:17,915
My pleasure.

818
00:30:18,202 --> 00:30:19,436
So can I ask you something?

819
00:30:19,544 --> 00:30:20,163
Sure.

820
00:30:20,323 --> 00:30:22,703
It involves the E word and the R word.

821
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:26,653
Please, let's not discuss evolution or
recycling. They're just too hot-button.

822
00:30:26,748 --> 00:30:28,841
Weren't Emily and Richard paying for Yale?

823
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:29,878
Yes, they were.

824
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:31,238
Something going on there?

825
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,247
Everything's fine.

826
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:34,271
Why'd she take time off? What happened there?

827
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:36,606
It's - it's a long story.

828
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:38,639
Listen, Chris, just so we're clear -

829
00:30:38,732 --> 00:30:41,637
We're clear. I'm providing. That's it.

830
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,164
I'm just doing what I should
have done years ago.

831
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:44,925
Good.

832
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:47,284
And it will remain good. Honest.

833
00:30:47,384 --> 00:30:48,478
Okay.

834
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:52,004
So how long have you been engaged?

835
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:54,407
Who told you?

836
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,730
Your finger.

837
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:57,937
Oh. Blabbermouth.

838
00:30:58,091 --> 00:31:01,264
It's a good thing. I want you happy,
I always have.

839
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:02,566
I know, thank you.

840
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:06,624
But, this isn't going to be a weird thing
with you and him, is it? My paying for Yale.

841
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,468
No, it's not going to be.

842
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:09,681
Well, cool.

843
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:12,759
You're getting a Rolls for a wedding present,
you know.

844
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:15,723
Cool, I should register for
a driver to go with it.

845
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:17,679
Well, yeah,
they're too big to drive by yourself.

846
00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:19,635
No, God,
you've got to have somebody drive you.

847
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:21,602
Bye, now. Have a nice -

848
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:24,022
Thanksgiving. Huh?

849
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:29,171
My rolls exploded!

850
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,406
What do you mean, they exploded?

851
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:32,792
They turned black and they exploded!

852
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:35,340
- Well, clean them up. I'm not going to -
- My turkey!

853
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:37,354
Liz?

854
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:42,629
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

855
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:45,110
It's like Motley Crue's been here.

856
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:48,209
Good, that red button thingy
hasn't popped up yet.

857
00:31:48,294 --> 00:31:50,229
Look, you're way over-cooking
your stuffing, here.

858
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,153
Hey, how do you turn on your oven light?
Never mind, I'll check my Martha.

859
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:57,123
How to turn on my oven light is not going
to be in your Martha Stewart book.

860
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,073
Hey, that red pop-up thingy. Are turkeys born
with that or is that something they put in?

861
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:03,543
I don't know, why don't you ask Martha?

862
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:05,387
Oh, she knows. She knows everything.

863
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:07,526
Hey, you're going to have to get
some canned cranberry sauce.

864
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:12,296
Your homemade
- well, it's not red. It should be red.

865
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,967
I know, I don't know how that happened.

866
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:17,823
Well, everything seems kind
of under control here.

867
00:32:17,912 --> 00:32:22,822
Thanks, Luke. I'm so sorry, TJ thought the
microwave was working but I guess not.

868
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:24,336
It's okay.

869
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:29,267
Liz -

870
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:33,210
Look at Martha's hands! They're so white!

871
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:34,629
Liz, you got a minute?

872
00:32:36,557 --> 00:32:38,979
Yeah, big brother, I got a minute.

873
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:47,883
Um, this is hard, I -

874
00:32:48,495 --> 00:32:52,594
I feel like this giant weight's
been sitting on me, I just - I
just need someone to talk to.

875
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:54,221
Well, then talk.

876
00:32:59,232 --> 00:33:00,501
I've got a kid.

877
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,610
A kid? You've got a kid?

878
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:06,907
A girl. A little girl. She's twelve.

879
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:08,777
I am her father.

880
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:10,802
Oh, boy, oh boy!

881
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:16,587
She came to the diner out of the blue and she
was testing to see who her father was.

882
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:20,833
Not for money or anything,
it was for this science fair she was in.

883
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,489
She's smart.

884
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,549
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

885
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:27,819
So I went down to the fair and there she was.

886
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:30,475
You know, and there I was.

887
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:33,069
My picture, the DNA test.

888
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,264
She's mine.

889
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,305
- Twelve, huh?
- Twelve.

890
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:40,112
That's Anna Nardini, isn't it?

891
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:41,485
How'd you know?

892
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:45,044
Luke, you're not Warren Beatty. I mean,
you could have been, girls like you,

893
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:48,565
but you're a serial monogamist.
That's why you're you.

894
00:33:49,262 --> 00:33:51,259
I remember Anna, I liked her!

895
00:33:51,357 --> 00:33:55,369
I don't know what to do.
I'm just so confused.

896
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:57,296
Well, what did Lorelai say?

897
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,994
You haven't told her.

898
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,497
We're engaged, we're on track here,
her and me.

899
00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:05,990
And Rory's back, so that's settled now.
We're in a good place!

900
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:06,850
You know, this could wreck it.

901
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:08,962
It won't wreck it. Not unless you let it.

902
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:11,864
She's been out there twelve years,
this little girl!

903
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,421
What does Anna want from you?

904
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,845
That's the thing. Nothing.
She hasn't contacted me.

905
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:19,255
I mean, why hasn't she?
She could have called me.

906
00:34:19,354 --> 00:34:21,825
What? Does she think I'd be a deadbeat?

907
00:34:21,914 --> 00:34:23,676
Oh! No one would think that.

908
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:26,727
April doesn't want anything either.
That's her name. April.

909
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:30,313
You know,
it's all just very scientific with her.

910
00:34:30,424 --> 00:34:33,795
I couldn't even get her to
go for ice cream with me.

911
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:34,766
Whoa.

912
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:37,106
Did you offer cake?

913
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:38,526
No.

914
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:41,195
Maybe she wanted cake. Or pie. You offer pie?

915
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:41,890
No.

916
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:44,129
Maybe she wanted pie. Or fudge.

917
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:48,313
It's not about what I offered her, Liz.
She didn't have any interest.

918
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:52,818
You know, that's the thing.
Why should I feel burdened?

919
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:56,856
I mean, they're not reaching out.
Neither one of them. So why should I?

920
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:57,732
I don't know -

921
00:34:57,822 --> 00:35:02,113
I mean, the girl's got her life.
She seems very adjusted, a little weird,
but thriving.

922
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:05,808
Anna's got her life, I've got my life,
you know.

923
00:35:06,276 --> 00:35:11,257
I shouldn't worry about this. I mean,
why should I? There's no reason to.

924
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:12,481
I guess not.

925
00:35:12,566 --> 00:35:14,182
Good. Good.

926
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:18,032
I'm not going to worry.
I'm going to let it go.

927
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:20,292
Yeah, this has been good.

928
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:23,942
Thanks for listening, Liz. I feel better.

929
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,831
Well, you should get back
to your food, there.

930
00:35:26,964 --> 00:35:28,713
This is settled.

931
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:29,871
Okay.

932
00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:30,676
All right.

933
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:32,493
There's your Martha.

934
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:34,181
Thanks.

935
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:45,042
Everyone's here, everyone's hungry!

936
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,449
Perfect timing, 'cause Tree,
Chuck and Bob here are ready to be consumed.

937
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:49,635
Please, don't name the food we eat.

938
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,504
Sorry.

939
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,675
So are you ready to carve?

940
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:54,963
We're ready to carve.
I could use some help, though.
Maybe send Luke in.

941
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:56,254
He loves to carve.

942
00:35:56,368 --> 00:35:58,564
There's enough food, right?
Did I make enough food?

943
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,704
There's plenty,
even considering the extra guests.

944
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,530
Good. Go tell them it'll be five minutes.

945
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:03,425
Will do.

946
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:11,235
Huzzah!

947
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:15,181
You're so good at that, Stu! Really.

948
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,619
Too bad you didn't put all that effort
into something you can make money at.

949
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,769
Thanks, Liz.

950
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:22,503
So, when are you coming back out on the
Renaissance Fair circuit with us, Luke?

951
00:36:22,588 --> 00:36:25,139
I think sometime after I'm
drugged and lobotomized.

952
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:29,149
You're the funniest,
smartest guy I know, Luke.

953
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:31,172
I'm calling him Yakov from now on.

954
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:32,630
Please don't judge me by this.

955
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:34,314
I won't. Yakov.

956
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:35,864
We're just minutes away
from eating, everybody!

957
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,276
Oh, I can't wait to see this meal!

958
00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:40,908
My dinner didn't turn out
like Martha's picture.

959
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:44,016
Who knew a turkey could melt like that?
I didn't.

960
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:45,644
Hey, guys, when'd you sneak in?

961
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:46,773
Oh, just a couple minutes ago.

962
00:36:46,877 --> 00:36:47,687
How'd you like to carve for us?

963
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:48,759
I'll carve if you want.

964
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:51,247
Bless you. Um, let me talk to you
over here for a second first.

965
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:52,224
Oh, okay.

966
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:56,179
- So.
- Yeah?

967
00:36:56,356 --> 00:37:00,687
Um. That Christopher call from before,
the famous one?

968
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:01,801
The infamous one.

969
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,556
Oh, you remember that?

970
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:03,701
I remember it.

971
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:05,957
Well, I never filled you in on the content.

972
00:37:07,414 --> 00:37:12,261
He said he wanted to talk and he said it
was important, so I met up with him.

973
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:12,850
Oh, yeah?

974
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:17,207
Yeah. And he's come into a lot of money,
family money.

975
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:20,854
And he offered Rory and me lots of
things we didn't want or need,

976
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:24,479
but Rory took him up on his
offer to pay for Yale.

977
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:27,169
It was her idea and I support it. That's it.

978
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,882
So he's going to be financing her
tuition this year and next year

979
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:36,858
and, um, we got together today at a diner
to finalize it, and that's it.

980
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:39,934
I think that's great.

981
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,669
Really?

982
00:37:40,787 --> 00:37:42,798
Yes. I think that's absolutely great.

983
00:37:42,895 --> 00:37:44,562
You heard the part about how I
got together with Christopher?

984
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:48,662
Absolutely. You had to, to talk about this.
He's her dad. He's her dad.

985
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:51,438
If he's got something,
he should be sharing it, good for him.

986
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:55,553
He's been gone most of the time,
so he owes you. I'm glad he's doing it.

987
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:59,705
He's doing what a dad is supposed to do.
He's taking care of his kid. Good. Good.

988
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,675
Yeah, good. So you're good with this.

989
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,270
I am.

990
00:38:02,386 --> 00:38:03,204
And so we're good.

991
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:04,372
We're great.

992
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:06,805
Thank you for understanding.

993
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:11,095
I'm going to go carve.

994
00:38:11,198 --> 00:38:11,884
Okay.

995
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,342
Oh, Rory, have you met Freddy?
He has no thumbs.

996
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,576
No, I haven't. Hi, Freddy.

997
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:22,768
Hi!

998
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,763
Excuse me.

999
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:29,293
Hello?

1000
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:31,456
Rory, hi! It's Honor Huntzberger.

1001
00:38:31,593 --> 00:38:33,464
Oh, hi, Honor. How are you doing?

1002
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:34,707
I've been exiled.

1003
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,130
My parent's house is eleven
thousand square feet

1004
00:38:37,226 --> 00:38:39,940
and smoking is banned from every
nook and cranny of it.

1005
00:38:40,036 --> 00:38:41,917
Only because Mom stopped smoking again.

1006
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,543
So, here I am, freezing my ass off.

1007
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:44,221
Bummer.

1008
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:47,877
So, I thought I'd call and tell you what a
drag it is, this thing with you and Logan.

1009
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:48,934
Oh, yeah?

1010
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:52,067
When Logan said you two broke up,
I almost threw a lamp at him.

1011
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:55,511
Moron. He's his own worst enemy.

1012
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:58,919
He told you that we broke up?

1013
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,767
Well, I was wondering where
you were for Thanksgiving,

1014
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:04,841
and at first young Seacrest hemmed and hawed,
which wasn't sufficient,

1015
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:07,428
so he finally told me.

1016
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:09,671
Idiot. Him, not you.

1017
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:10,436
Right.

1018
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:13,415
I'm so sorry.
But you and I can still go shopping,
you know.

1019
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:14,546
Bergdorf's is calling.

1020
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:16,116
Yeah. Sure.

1021
00:39:16,218 --> 00:39:20,084
Good. Well, I have to get back inside
before I turn into an ice cube.

1022
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:21,550
Are you at least having a nice Thanksgiving?

1023
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:23,032
Yeah. It's really nice.

1024
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:24,021
I'll be in touch.

1025
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:24,885
Sure.

1026
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,537
Thanks, Honor.

1027
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:26,601
- Bye.
- Bye.

1028
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:31,576
Okay, that's too thin, too thin!

1029
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:33,426
I'm just getting started, give me some room.

1030
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:35,876
Okay, that's too thick, too thick, too thick!

1031
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:37,034
Hang on, Sookie.

1032
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,198
You’re crooked. Crooked.

1033
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:40,141
Okay.

1034
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:41,141
Good idea.

1035
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:56,169
Information, listing please?

1036
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:58,493
Yeah, uh, Nardini?

1037
00:39:58,611 --> 00:40:00,099
- City?
- Woodbridge.

1038
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:01,716
- Please hold.
- Thanks.

1039
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:06,185
Press one to be connected to area code -

1040
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:10,963
Hello. You've reached the Nardini residence.

1041
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:14,462
We're not home, or else we're too distracted
to answer right now, so -

1042
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,497
- She kick you out?
- What? Who?

1043
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,204
- Sookie.
- Oh, yeah.

1044
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:30,061
Predictable.

1045
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:31,521
Yeah, predictable.

1046
00:40:31,952 --> 00:40:33,238
Hey! You okay?

1047
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,926
- Kind of.
- You sure?

1048
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:37,117
I'm just hungry.

1049
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:39,508
Dinner is served!
