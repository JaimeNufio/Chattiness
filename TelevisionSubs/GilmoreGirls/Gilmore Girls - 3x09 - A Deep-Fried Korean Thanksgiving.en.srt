1
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:56,561
I like these women.

2
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,624
I love these women.

3
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,086
- Poor Edie. 
- Which Edie?

4
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:11,409
Little Edie. She’s just trying to sing and her mom won’t stop talking.

5
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:14,332
Big Edie was so beautiful in her day.

6
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:15,326
They were both pretty.

7
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:16,867
I can’t believe they were related to Jackie.

8
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:19,469
The Kennedy’s kind of hid them in the background for many years.

9
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:20,473
When you’re a Kennedy,

10
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:22,157
how do you even choose who in the family to hide?

11
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:23,063
It’s a tough choice.

12
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,981
Something beautiful about them though.

13
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:34,031
They’re cool, they’re free.

14
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:35,727
Yeah, and they’re memorable.

15
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:38,301
Most people are very forgettable. And they’re happy.

16
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,094
- They had their cats. 
- And their raccoons.

17
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:41,763
- And their pretty house. 
- And each other.

18
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,781
Add a few years and they’re us.

19
00:01:48,006 --> 00:02:51,369
Rhiana, run it through the sieve again, I want it smooth as glass.

20
00:02:51,526 --> 00:02:53,088
Don’t cut corners, people!

21
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:55,311
- Is she melting down? 
- Like butter on a skillet.

22
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:56,765
- Sookie... 
- Just a sec, hon.

23
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,796
How’s your love life, Pete? A little frustrated, I bet.

24
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,102
Wondering how I know that?

25
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:02,974
‘Cause you’re taking it out on my egg whites.

26
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:05,909
Gently, fold them gently.

27
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:09,462
Cheryl – you’re slicing not dicing, I can hear it in the chop.

28
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:10,896
Adjust, my friend.

29
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,431
Sookie, whoa... Hey, let’s talk.

30
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:15,045
I’m extremely lacking in time here.

31
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,857
- What’s going on? 
- Chaos?

32
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,161
A travesty of cooking? It’s a salmonella laboratory in here!

33
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:21,906
Sookie, the kitchen will be in good hands.

34
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:22,951
But not in my hands.

35
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,707
It’ll be in Bob hands. Bob has great hands.

36
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:25,936
No, you know what Bob has?

37
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:29,335
Bob has two seconds to get the hollandaise off the flame before I break his neck!

38
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,131
Sookie, listen, you hired Bob. You trained him in your image.

39
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,092
He’s great, and he’s subbed for you before.

40
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:36,448
But this is Thanksgiving, he has never done Thanksgiving.

41
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:38,659
He’s ready, he’ll sub for you seamlessly.

42
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,985
Even Big Joe Newsanchor’s have substitutes.

43
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:42,346
And that’s the thing.

44
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,900
They still say, ‘And now the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather.’

45
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:46,888
You see?

46
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:50,432
Dan is still associated with it even though he’s off snorkeling or something,

47
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,274
just like I’m gonna be associated with the dinner

48
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:54,389
because Bob is substituting for Sookie.

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,151
Excuse me one minute.

50
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,814
Oh, this can only be good.

51
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:00,805
Sookie, that’s the garbage.

52
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,274
Stop rooting through the garbage.

53
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,804
I will when people stop throwing away useful stuff!

54
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,959
Drop, drop the, drop the tops,

55
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,299
drop ‘em... Come here, come here...

56
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:12,249
Now, Sookie, listen to me because you’re torturing yourself here.

57
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,498
Emily, hi.

58
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,054
Oh, that’s nice. That’s very high school. Stick with me here.

59
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:17,287
Good to see you.

60
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,745
Yeah, that’s funny. You know who’s behind you?

61
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,522
It’s Joseph Stalin, my good friend.

62
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,406
What are you doing back from the dead, Joe?

63
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:24,850
- Lorelai. 
- Oh, Mom!

64
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,507
- Ah, geez, you scared me. 
- You heard Sookie greet me.

65
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,212
Oh, I thought it was a joke.

66
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:30,902
Like comparing me to Joseph Stalin?

67
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:32,300
I wasn’t comparing you to Joseph Stalin.

68
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:33,810
I’m in a hurry. Can we speak for a minute?

69
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:35,567
Yeah, I guess, for a minute.

70
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:40,005
- So, were you in the area or something? 
- Not really.

71
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,921
- Then what are you doing here? 
- I wanted to talk to you.

72
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:42,874
Phone’s out of order?

73
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:44,302
Let’s not play games here.

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,402
Games?

75
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,682
I’ve called several times the past few weeks

76
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:49,463
and you’ve skillfully avoided every call.

77
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,727
No, that’s not true. I’ve left messages on your machine.

78
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:52,915
Yes, messages.

79
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:55,398
And then if I happened to pick up, you’d hang up.

80
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:57,671
Or if the maid picked up, you’d ask for me,

81
00:04:57,784 --> 00:05:00,581
then claim you were driving through a tunnel so you might get cut off,

82
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,392
and then you’d make garbling noises and hang up.

83
00:05:02,484 --> 00:05:03,652
Fine, Mom, we’re talking now. What’s up?

84
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:04,604
Are you feeling well?

85
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:05,858
You came all the way out here to ask me that?

86
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,938
You’ve been sick these past few Friday’s for dinner,

87
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:10,406
so I was concerned. That’s why you didn’t come, right,

88
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:12,422
because you were sick? So are you better? You look fine.

89
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:14,547
Oh, it’s the makeup. I’m still...

90
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:17,609
these allergies really just hit me like a ton of bricks.

91
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:19,356
I’ve never heard you mention allergies before.

92
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:20,703
I’m a silent sufferer.

93
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,331
I certainly hope you’re feeling better now

94
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:24,312
because I want you to come to dinner tomorrow night.

95
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:26,134
Tomorrow? Tomorrow’s Thanksgiving.

96
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:27,722
Yes, it is Thanksgiving.

97
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:31,675
And before you sift through the dozen or so excuses you always have on hand,

98
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:35,106
let me have my say. You’ve missed two dinners and avoided my calls

99
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,421
because you’re mad at us about what happened at Yale.

100
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:40,124
But I want you and Rory at Thanksgiving this year.

101
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:41,470
- Mom... 
- If you have plans...

102
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,385
- We do have plans. 
- Alter them.

103
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:46,827
Now, there’ll be other people there, so the focus won’t be on you,

104
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,706
and you may even be able to get by

105
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:51,742
without saying more than ‘hello’, ‘goodbye’, and ‘pass the gravy’.

106
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:52,643
We already have plans.

107
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,666
Your father and I are going out of town the next day

108
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:57,108
and we’ll be gone all of December, including Christmas,

109
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,201
so it’s the last chance for the family to be together for the rest of the year.

110
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:00,764
Look...

111
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:02,335
And I want you to remember that I am not the one

112
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:05,684
who set the meeting for Rory behind your back. I want you there, Lorelai.

113
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:09,048
And if you’re still sick, I don’t want a doctor’s note.

114
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:11,589
I want your doctor himself to come to my house

115
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:13,548
and convince me that it’s true, got it?

116
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:14,435
Got it.

117
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:15,546
See you tomorrow.

118
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,391
The multi-layered membrane systems of the cytoplasm

119
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,765
are the smooth endoplasmic reticulum,

120
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,890
the rough endoplasmic reticulum,

121
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:26,284
and the golgi body.

122
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:28,603
Now, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum

123
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:31,623
is concerned with the manufacture of lipid molecules.

124
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:34,968
We’ll continue on this next week.

125
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,426
Keep up on your reading please.

126
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:40,212
That was really distracting.

127
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,289
Oh. Well, by all means, Madeline,

128
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:44,952
you should point out to the faculty that their annoying custom of teaching

129
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:46,756
is distracting you from more important things

130
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:49,426
like nail filing and daydreaming about marrying Ryan Phillippe.

131
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,488
He’s already married.

132
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,987
Then whatever strawhead actor isn’t.

133
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,077
This was bad. For the last five minutes,

134
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:56,447
every single thing she said sounded dirty.

135
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:58,660
- Yeah, same here. 
- Good God.

136
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:00,580
I mean, reticulum? Come on.

137
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,273
Plus, the golgi body.

138
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:04,599
I mean, is it me or is that majorly pornographic?

139
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:06,017
My life with the Banger sisters.

140
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,214
- So, changing the subject... 
- Hallelujah.

141
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:09,719
What’s everybody doing for Thanksgiving?

142
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,501
I can’t even talk about Thanksgiving.

143
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,289
- Louise? 
- I‘m having dinner with my dad.

144
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:14,779
Isn’t he still in jail?

145
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:18,700
Yes, but his company donated some treadmills for the inmates

146
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:22,689
so he swung a special trailer for dinner that they’re gonna set up for us in the parking lot.

147
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,042
We have it for about two hours and then one of the Manson girls gets us.

148
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:27,789
You’re lucky it’s in that order.

149
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,903
My Thanksgiving is turning into a Wes Craven movie.

150
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:30,800
How so?

151
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,966
I called shelters to volunteer to serve food.

152
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:34,793
It’s Thanksgiving – you’d think they have needs.

153
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:37,589
Nope. Every stupid soup kitchen in town turned me down

154
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:39,407
- because they have enough volunteers. 
- Bummer.

155
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,716
I’m on a couple waiting lists, but it doesn’t look good.

156
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,534
I’ve never heard of too many volunteers.

157
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:46,324
Who are all these jackasses who volunteered anyway?

158
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:49,899
They can’t all be students like me. They’re not all putting it on a college application.

159
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:52,510
I get something out of it and these other people don’t get a thing.

160
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,896
- Talk about selfish. 
- Sore subject.

161
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,114
What are you up to, Madeline?

162
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:58,087
I’ve got more college applications to fill out.

163
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:00,042
Backups, safety schools.

164
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,397
I’ve got some of that, too. I’m so behind.

165
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,225
I told you guys to have those things done by now.

166
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:05,203
Sorry, Mom.

167
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:07,380
It’s not about being sorry. It’s about being prepared.

168
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:09,423
I got Harvard and my backups in weeks ago.

169
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,936
Okay, all you’re doing is making me more nervous.

170
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:13,995
- I’ll see you guys Monday. 
- Same here.

171
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,479
Yup, see you guys Monday.

172
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,579
Harvard is going to be expecting Thanksgiving shelter work.

173
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:20,641
They’ll know I called too late and it will totally impugn my organizational skills.

174
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:25,438
By the way, you know I ultimately do all these things for the good of mankind, right?

175
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:26,145
Oh yeah.

176
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:27,870
- Sometimes I don’t think I come off that way. 
- No.

177
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,493
Hello?

178
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:32,705
Yes, thanks for returning my call...

179
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:37,072
Nothing? But wait, wait, wait – just stick me at any old pot.

180
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:39,463
I’m small, you won’t even know I’m there, I’ll even bring my own ladle...

181
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:43,780
Oh, now, come on, work with me here. I’ve got a slotted spoon...

182
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:47,436
What about coffee or condiments? You got condiments covered?

183
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,687
I’m sorry, can I speak to your supervisor?

184
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,010
My attitude? What about your attitude?

185
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,407
I’m trying to help people. It’s Thanksgiving...

186
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:58,209
So she coldcocked you, huh?

187
00:08:58,408 --> 00:09:02,342
She bit me, incapacitated me with her poison, and devoured me whole.

188
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:04,624
But how are we going to go to four Thanksgiving dinners?

189
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:05,761
It’s not four, is it?

190
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:08,444
Lane’s house, Sookie’s, and we always stop by Luke’s...

191
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:10,697
that’s three, and Grandma and Grandpa is four.

192
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:12,509
- We’re mad, Edie. 
- We’re us, Edie.

193
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:15,209
We’ve gotta go to my parents’ or we’ll be brought up on war crimes.

194
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,666
Lane’s is always super early, so that’s easy to catch.

195
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:19,606
- Sookie’s is mid afternoon. 
- Luke’s the toughie.

196
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,890
- Guess that’s the one we’ll have to skip. 
- Bummer.

197
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:23,272
I know, but he won’t care.

198
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:24,793
Holidays are nothing to him anyway.

199
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:27,092
Hey Kirk. Discover a new freaky fetish?

200
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,981
- What? 
- Nothing. You buy a cat?

201
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,935
- Yup. I’m very excited. 
- You seem it. So what’s all this?

202
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,759
I’m assuming there’s nothing left in the store.

203
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,403
Actually, there are a number of things left.

204
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:37,503
No, I meant you seem to be buying a lot of stuff.

205
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:38,721
Oh, sorry.

206
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,911
My excitement must be clouding my ability to judge comedic hyperbole.

207
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:42,817
So where’d you get the cat?

208
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,577
A lady had a bunch of them at the grocery store

209
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,673
and Kirk seemed to take an instant liking to me.

210
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:47,749
- Kirk? 
- Yes?

211
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:49,166
No, I mean, the cat’s name is Kirk?

212
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:52,017
- Weird coincidence or... 
- I named him Kirk.

213
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:53,089
Isn’t that confusing?

214
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:54,512
Not when you think about it.

215
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,508
No, it’s still confusing.

216
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:59,878
I like the name, and whenever I call Kirk’s name,

217
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,536
I obviously won’t be calling myself.

218
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:02,560
True.

219
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:05,157
Although when my mom calls for Kirk, that may be confusing.

220
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,270
Maybe I can get her to say CatKirk when she’s calling Kirk,

221
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:10,001
and HumanKirk when she’s calling me.

222
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:11,214
That would keep it straight.

223
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:12,761
I’m glad I ran into you. See ya.

224
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,344
- See ya, HumanKirk. 
- Bye HumanKirk.

225
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:17,659
He’s always been a cat person, he’s just never had a cat.

226
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:24,112
- Hey. Anywhere? 
- Anywhere.

227
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,178
- Would you mind moving? 
- I hate when you do that.

228
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:30,041
- It’s my showstopper. 
- An empty table.

229
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:32,023
- You ready to order? 
- I’m ready.

230
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:34,634
Don’t bother, saw you coming, already ordered your Wednesday usual –

231
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:37,338
the French dip, extra fries, the every-Wednesday cherry pie.

232
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:39,319
- Such service. 
- Oh, and such a food rut we’re in.

233
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,500
- Thank you, Luke. 
- I gotta get back to stuffing my turkey.

234
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:43,975
Oh, honey, do you have time to do that and prep your Thanksgiving food?

235
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,178
- Stop it. 
- Here, here.

236
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:46,851
It’s a tedious job.

237
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,232
What if we told you you could stuff one less?

238
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:50,521
- What do you mean? 
- We got jammed.

239
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:52,985
Shanghaied by my mother and what with the other things we have going...

240
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:54,777
well, too many commitments, not enough us.

241
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:56,544
- So? 
- We can’t make it tomorrow.

242
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,623
Oh, okay, fine.

243
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,119
It was beyond our control.

244
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:02,227
That’s fine, whatever. I’ll be right back.

245
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:07,977
Okay, I may be crazy, but he almost looked...

246
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:10,328
- Disappointed. 
- Yes, disappointed.

247
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,877
- We disappointed Luke. 
- I didn’t think it was possible.

248
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:14,486
Our powers are greater than we know.

249
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:16,258
He actually likes it when we come for Thanksgiving.

250
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:17,748
All these years and we never knew.

251
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:19,888
He’s the Grinch and we’re Cindy Lou Who.

252
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,383
So Cindy Lou, what do we do?

253
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,145
I got it.

254
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:27,072
Oh, perfect. That works great. Okay, bye now.

255
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:30,718
Sorry, I’m just clarifying the schedule for tomorrow.

256
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,960
As luck has it, we can make it. We’ll definitely be here.

257
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:34,527
- It’s okay. 
- No, it’s all cleared.

258
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:37,723
That was my mom, and the time’s just gonna work out just fine.

259
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:40,604
Really, you don’t have to. I already stopped prepping the last turkey.

260
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:43,816
Well, start prepping it again ‘cause we are coming.

261
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:45,525
I don’t want you to feel like you have to come.

262
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:46,433
This is tiring.

263
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:48,321
I can kneel behind him and you can push him over.

264
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:49,898
- It may come to that. 
- It won’t be a hassle?

265
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:51,420
- It won’t be a hassle. 
- You sure?

266
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:54,661
We’re coming, now go away and let us eat. Shoo, shoo.

267
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:57,682
That was very nice.

268
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,828
Well, I hate disappointing people.

269
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:01,533
Okay, now, practical question...

270
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:03,610
how are we going to eat four Thanksgiving dinners?

271
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:07,542
How? Rory, what are we if not world champion eaters?

272
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:09,427
- It’s too much food. 
- It’s not too much food.

273
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,742
This is what we’ve been training for our whole lives. This is our destiny.

274
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,801
- This is our finest hour. 
- Or final hour.

275
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,744
No, no. Get inspired and tomorrow I guarantee you,

276
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,357
we will be standing on the Olympic platform

277
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,764
receiving our gold medals for eating.

278
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:22,284
We are not Michelle Kwan-ing this.

279
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:24,158
Okay, okay, four dinners.

280
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:25,182
Yeah, we’ll skip the rolls.

281
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:26,136
That’ll help.

282
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:28,449
You know, we might wanna consider not eating much now

283
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:30,728
in preparation for our finest hour.

284
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:33,405
A little fasting so that we can enjoy more tomorrow, hm?

285
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,815
- Unnecessary. 
- Yeah.

286
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:42,188
What's on the list?

287
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,443
Flowers for everyone we're visiting and cranberry sauce for the Kims.

288
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:46,201
Tums.

289
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:48,137
- You mean amateur pills? 
- Just in case.

290
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:49,316
Okay, Tums.

291
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:50,549
I’ll do the flowers.

292
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:52,566
- I’ll do Doose’s. 
- Thank you.

293
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,132
- Hey there. 
- Hey.

294
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,295
- Wait, stop. 
- What?

295
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,136
Stop.

296
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:03,467
What are you doing?

297
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,373
Come on.

298
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,837
- What was that? 
- That was a kiss.

299
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:11,937
What’s with the relocation before the kiss?

300
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,239
- It's too early. 
- Too early? Too early for what?

301
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:15,412
For kissing like that.

302
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,677
What's the rule, no kissing before noon?

303
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:20,088
No, it's too early to do this here.

304
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,080
Where, in the street?

305
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:22,908
In the street, with people watching...

306
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:23,974
What people?

307
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:26,893
- In front of Doose's.
- Ah, Doose's.

308
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,029
We shouldn't flaunt it.

309
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,062
- But I want to flaunt it. 
- It doesn't feel right.

310
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:32,023
- He's a big boy Rory.
- I know.

311
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,916
It's not the first time a couple’s broken up.

312
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,536
- It is for us.
- This is insane.

313
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:37,984
Please, let’s not flaunt it, please?

314
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,609
- For how long?
- Until it's comfortable.

315
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,221
Before we're on Social Security?

316
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:46,023
I promise, we can kiss secretly.

317
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:48,745
Yeah, or we can wear Three Stooges masks all the time,

318
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,046
that way no one will know who we are.

319
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:51,403
- I can be Curly. 
- I’ll be Moe.

320
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,028
- Probably too silly. 
- Yeah, probably.

321
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,925
This will get better over time, I promise.

322
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:58,110
But until then, let’s just play it cool.

323
00:13:58,332 --> 00:13:59,930
Hey, I’m Frank at the Sands.

324
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:00,932
That’s cool.

325
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:10,738
Oh, hey, Kirk. Doing your holiday shopping?

326
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:13,078
Well, shopping, yes, and it is a holiday,

327
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:16,018
but my shopping isn’t holiday related, so technically no.

328
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:18,604
Oh, what happened there?

329
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:20,502
Oh, nothing, just a little scratch.

330
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,773
Looks like a big scratch.

331
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,501
Wow, Bactine, Neosporin, Mercurochrome...

332
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,017
what’s with all the pharmacologicals?

333
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:29,273
Oh, well, Kirk and I are going through a little adjustment period, that’s all.

334
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:30,907
- CatKirk? 
- It’s no biggie,

335
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:34,015
and this looks a lot worse than it is.

336
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:35,520
Yeah, I can see that.

337
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,614
So how’d it happen? Were you playing or something?

338
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:38,966
We haven’t actually played yet.

339
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:42,048
This happened when I accidentally walked into the room without announcing myself.

340
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:42,975
Excuse me?

341
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:45,020
I’ve discovered Kirk likes my presence announced

342
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:46,615
before I enter any room that he’s in.

343
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,030
You have to announce yourself?

344
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:51,613
Yeah, just a quick, ‘Is it okay if I come in?’ from the adjacent room.

345
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:53,748
Otherwise, he gets a little testy.

346
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:54,655
Hence the scratch.

347
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:57,318
It’s just a small laceration. Again, no biggie.

348
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,000
Kirk, he got your neck!

349
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:01,690
That was another mistake of mine.

350
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:03,724
I put his food bowl down in front of him.

351
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:06,017
He doesn’t like that. Or she doesn’t.

352
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,487
She? I thought Kirk was a boy.

353
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:08,761
That was just a guess.

354
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:13,472
He actually hasn’t exposed his underside to me yet. Or hers.

355
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,544
Well, here’s hoping your cat exposes itself to you soon.

356
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,060
>From your mouth to God’s ears.

357
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,437
- See ya. 
- See ya.

358
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:25,576
Hi there.

359
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:26,615
Hi.

360
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,392
So you pulled the Thanksgiving shift, huh?

361
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,252
Yeah, I get time and a half.

362
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:31,634
Good, good. It’s good to see you.

363
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:34,850
Same here. So, I gotta work.

364
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:36,770
Right, right. That Taylor’s a dictator.

365
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,011
Dean, wait.

366
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:47,062
Look, we live in a teeny tiny little hamlet here.

367
00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:51,204
I mean, stick it in an envelope and we could mail the whole town for a buck-forty.

368
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,138
It makes avoiding people tough and uncomfortable.

369
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:55,096
I know.

370
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:58,121
I hate hiding from people, especially when I don’t wanna hide from them.

371
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:01,424
You were a pal. You were so good to Rory.

372
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,303
You were the best first boyfriend a mother could’ve hoped for.

373
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,747
Thanks.

374
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,468
It’s okay to keep avoiding me if you want.

375
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,158
I just wanted you to know that you don’t need to, okay?

376
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:13,129
Just because you and Rory broke up doesn’t mean we did.

377
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,525
Good. That’s good to hear.

378
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,180
Well, Happy Thanksgiving.

379
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:21,906
Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving.

380
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,733
- Aw, pretty! 
- Yeah, good selection today.

381
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:35,813
- You get everything? 
- And then some. Look.

382
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:38,556
Chocolate turkeys, nice!

383
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,944
I think they’ll add a festive air.

384
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:40,829
Definitely.

385
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:44,327
- So, was he in there? 
- Yeah, he was.

386
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:47,517
Good, good. I hope he’s good.

387
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:49,457
- Did he seem good? 
- He seemed good.

388
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:51,495
- He’s getting time and a half. 
- Good, good.

389
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:53,774
- So, let’s go eat. 
- And eat and eat.

390
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:56,887
- And eat and eat and eat. 
- And eat and eat and eat and eat...

391
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:01,910
- Ah, the Gilmores. Happy Thanksgiving. 
- Happy Thanksgiving.

392
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:03,216
- Happy Thanksgiving. 
- Come in.

393
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:05,090
- She’s in a good mood this year. 
- Downright chipper.

394
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,922
So, Mrs. Kim, we... we brought gifts.

395
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:08,900
Flowers.

396
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,828
And cranberry sauce, our little Thanksgiving tradition.

397
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:13,266
Thank you, can never have too much.

398
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:15,362
- That’s what we say. 
- Plus, a chocolate turkey.

399
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:16,477
What should I do with this?

400
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:17,968
Oh, I don’t know, let the kids share it.

401
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,576
And then send a blank check to their dentist?

402
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,126
They don’t have to eat it, they can play with it.

403
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:21,978
Play with chocolate?

404
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,677
It’s missing its head.

405
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:24,983
Ooh, that one’s ours.

406
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:28,423
Here, this one has a head. There ya go.

407
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:29,263
Okay.

408
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:32,171
My arms are too short to box with Mrs. Kim.

409
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:33,794
The singing’s already begun.

410
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:36,657
Who’s that playing guitar? He looks familiar.

411
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:38,931
Oh my God, that’s Lane’s Dave.

412
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,802
Oh, yeah, it is. He’s all neat and tidy.

413
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:43,386
- He’s gone corporate. 
- He’s gone Korean.

414
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:46,544
Oh, hey, hi.

415
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:49,689
Hey yourself. Hey, how’d you get your mom to let you...

416
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:51,255
Come on, girls, let’s get you some punch.

417
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:53,928
- What’s going on? 
- That is not Dave Rygalski.

418
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:56,171
- Oh, intrigue. 
- Who is it?

419
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,935
I mean, not the one that I’m in a band with.

420
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,918
That is Dave Rygalski, local Christian guitar player that my mom

421
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:05,361
and I met very briefly and innocently at the dance marathon,

422
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,122
and that I coincidentally ran across again

423
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:09,929
when I found his ad seeking Christian guitar accompaniment gigs up

424
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:11,721
- on our church bulletin board. 
- Complicated.

425
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,278
I even put the fake ad up at church

426
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,889
and pretended to find it with my mom next to me.

427
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:17,655
- You’re good. 
- So, are you guys dating?

428
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:18,879
We’re laying the groundwork.

429
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,756
If she gets to know him before we date and she approves of him,

430
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:23,313
we won’t have to hide anything.

431
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:24,537
Right, except how you met.

432
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:25,941
And who he really is.

433
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:27,721
But other than that, it’s completely fib-free.

434
00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:30,446
Watch it. You break it, you buy it.

435
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,498
Ten percent off for cousins, twenty percent off for nephews and nieces.

436
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:36,923
Yung Kwan, good to see you.

437
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:38,807
Hee Kim, hi. Oh, I love your hair.

438
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:40,446
Su Nam, hi. Hi.

439
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:43,994
Ho Kyung, Wan Kyu, great to see you, hi.

440
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,399
Oh, Mrs. Kim, just a beautiful table, as always.

441
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,744
Try the tofurkey. Turkey made from tofu.

442
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:50,840
Oh, we definitely will.

443
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:54,451
And meet the guitar player. Nice young man, big fan of tofurkey.

444
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:55,366
- David? 
- Yes.

445
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:57,603
This is Rory Gilmore and Mrs. Gilmore.

446
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,759
- Hi, nice to meet you. 
- Oh, same here.

447
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,142
I think I’ve seen you around town.

448
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,139
Yeah, that might be a possibility. Happy Thanksgiving.

449
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,609
Same to you.

450
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:06,549
- Hymn 17 please. 
- Yes, ma’am.

451
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,094
Wow, he seems like a very upright young man.

452
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:10,693
Not a bad sight-reader either.

453
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:13,702
You’re taking tofurkey?

454
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,051
And some extra napkins to slip the tofurkey into

455
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:19,334
when no one is looking and then toss them away.

456
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:20,348
Very smart.

457
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,210
Mama, just a thought, but maybe we can take a break

458
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:24,501
from the hymns while we eat?

459
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,125
No break, he’s paid to play.

460
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,704
We can quit singing for now, but he should play soft in the background, okay?

461
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:30,861
Yeah. Yes, ma’am.

462
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:48,203
- The best laid plans. 
- Tell me about it.

463
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:50,368
- How do you feel? 
- I ate tofurkey.

464
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:52,053
- How do you think I feel? 
- Tofurkier.

465
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:54,946
Drat that Mrs. Kim for not taking her eyes off me the whole time...

466
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:56,897
it’s like she was anticipating my napkin maneuver.

467
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:58,848
- Hi hon! 
- Happy Thanksgiving.

468
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:01,818
Ah, thank you. Thank God, civilization has arrived.

469
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:03,416
- What’s wrong? 
- What’s wrong?

470
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,187
Do you not see what’s going on here?

471
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,104
What’s that?

472
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,839
That is a vat of boiling oil.

473
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,380
Really? Where’s Quasimodo?

474
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:11,966
- This is not a joking matter. 
- What is the oil for?

475
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:13,988
- For pouring on visigoths. 
- Lorelai!

476
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,243
When else am I gonna get to use my visigoth material?

477
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:17,717
- What’s the oil for? 
- The turkey.

478
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,686
My beautiful, expensive, organically grown turkey.

479
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:21,414
I don’t get it.

480
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,846
A couple of days ago, Jackson asked me if he could cook the turkey.

481
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,882
I thought he was gonna roast it, stick a couple of onions around it,

482
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:28,679
something simple. So I said yes,

483
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:31,491
figuring that the minute he put it in the oven and leaves the kitchen,

484
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:34,368
I can sneak in and give it a nice herb-bitter rub

485
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:36,477
and stuff it with a pancetta-chestnut stuffing.

486
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:37,712
Sure, ‘cause he’d never notice that.

487
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:40,164
Exactly. Then the propane tank arrived,

488
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:44,423
and the industrial burner, and the fifteen gallons of peanut oil.

489
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:47,721
Then he springs it on me – ‘I’m gonna deep-fry a turkey."

490
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,709
- Deep-fried turkey. 
- Interesting.

491
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,868
I tried to talk him out of it, but I’d already promised

492
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,180
and now he’s excited about it.

493
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,566
Hey, what’s keeping Jackson? Is he on the pot or something?

494
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,244
Lots of precious memories in the making here.

495
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,229
Hey Jackson, get your butt out here with that gobbler!

496
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:02,177
A gobbler.

497
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:03,528
Maybe it won’t be that bad.

498
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,001
Yeah, deep-frying’s kind of in now.

499
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:08,141
I don’t care. You don’t deep-fry turkey.

500
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:12,089
Filet of fish, yes. A batch of fries, yes.

501
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,552
A donut, yes. Not turkey.

502
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:18,045
- Come on, let’s get going! 
- Yeah, we’re hungry!

503
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:23,211
Jackson, Jackson, Jackson...

504
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:25,577
Did someone say... Jackson?

505
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,006
Wow, it’s like Thunderdome in here.

506
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,153
He should’ve just driven it out on a monster truck.

507
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:37,025
He’s shamelessly catering to his demographic.

508
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,875
Are you ready?

509
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,979
Oh my God, I can’t look.

510
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,809
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... 
- Oh my God, they’re counting down.

511
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,382
... five, four, three, two, one!

512
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,594
- It’s in the vat. 
- It’s like a death in the family.

513
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:51,644
Look at the bright side, Sookie.

514
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:53,401
At least this took your mind off the dinner at the inn.

515
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:54,860
Oh my God, the inn.

516
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:58,265
What if Bob decides to do something equally awful to the turkey at the inn?

517
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,057
- I have to call him. 
- Oh, hey guys.

518
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:02,776
Neat, huh? And it only takes forty minutes.

519
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,223
- Cool. 
- How ya doing, hon?

520
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:05,361
Oh, fine, Sweets.

521
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:08,766
And keep ‘em coming.

522
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:12,397
Hey everybody.

523
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:15,843
Oh, hey there dollfaces. Happy Thanksgiving.

524
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:16,780
Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving.

525
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:20,159
- What’s this? 
- Flowers.

526
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:22,094
- What do I do with them? 
- Not this again.

527
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,368
- Put them in a vase with water. 
- I don’t have a vase.

528
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:26,831
- You do this every year. 
- I don’t have vases.

529
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:27,777
Buy a vase.

530
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,800
But I don’t need a vase ‘cause I never have flowers.

531
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,490
Except when we bring you flowers every year

532
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:32,944
on Thanksgiving. Buy a vase.

533
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:34,317
- Stop bringing me flowers. 
- Stop bringing me flowers.

534
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:36,365
I knew you were gonna say that because you say the same thing.

535
00:22:36,477 --> 00:22:38,582
We have this same exact conversation every year.

536
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:39,939
And every year you point that out.

537
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,911
- And every year you point that out. 
- And every year you point that out.

538
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:43,702
And then every year we put the flowers on the counter

539
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,146
and forget the ugliness ever happened.

540
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:46,150
At least we have a tradition.

541
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:48,351
Good. I’ll be right back. That’s our table over there.

542
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:49,796
Hey Kirk.

543
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:52,617
- Oh my God! 
- What happened?

544
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,167
I’m scratched over sixty percent of my body.

545
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,055
Aw, CatKirk again?

546
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,337
Sorry.

547
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:01,362
- I’m so mad at that cat. 
- Very uncool cat.

548
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:04,275
I love cats, but I love Kirk, too.

549
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,095
It’s pretty much fifty-fifty, and that’s a high compliment, my friend.

550
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,155
How did this happen?

551
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,811
Well, the tension of our standoff was unbearable,

552
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:13,447
so I got on the floor and tried to play with him.

553
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,003
- It’s a him? 
- I caught a peek.

554
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:15,781
Go on.

555
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:19,417
I rolled this cute little ball of yarn over to him all nice and gentle.

556
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,460
He tried to garrote me with it.

557
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:23,077
- Oh my God. 
- Very uncool.

558
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:25,981
Just grabbed two ends with his paws and came at me.

559
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:27,281
But he doesn’t have opposable thumbs.

560
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,361
He’s beyond them.

561
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:31,501
And he’s smart. He knows things, sometimes before they happen.

562
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,637
- Get a hold of yourself, man. 
- You haven’t heard the worst.

563
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:34,731
Oh geez, there’s worse?

564
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,569
When the attacks got particularly brutal,

565
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:39,707
I had no choice but to strip naked and hide under water in the bathtub.

566
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:41,915
I read that cats are afraid of water.

567
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:43,041
They are, they are.

568
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,017
Kirk isn’t. He found me,

569
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:48,647
and he seemed to derive greater power from the water.

570
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,639
That’s when the bulk of the scratching happened.

571
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,923
Well, then, I think it’s good you’re giving Kirk a little space right now.

572
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:55,781
Just relax and enjoy your food.

573
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:57,164
I can’t taste my food.

574
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,488
- Well, then, just try to relax. 
- Thanks.

575
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:10,087
Hi, Happy Thanksgiving. So, are you joining us?

576
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,883
- Sure, if that’s okay. 
- Yeah, sit, sit.

577
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,610
- God, I’m starved. 
- You could’ve eaten.

578
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:18,766
- You kept telling me not to eat. 
- I did not.

579
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:20,660
You did, too. You said you were waiting for them.

580
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:21,980
You didn’t have to wait for us.

581
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,982
I wasn’t waiting for you, it just worked out this way.

582
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:25,949
Right.

583
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:27,378
- Looks great. 
- Tasty.

584
00:24:27,823 --> 00:24:30,281
- Shouldn’t we give thanks first? 
- Thanks for what?

585
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,850
Well, that we’re not Native Americans who got their land stolen

586
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:36,426
in exchange for smallpox infested blankets.

587
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:37,434
Amen.

588
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:39,365
So where you guys in your day?

589
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:41,582
We hit the Kim’s, we hit Sookie’s,

590
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:43,358
and we go to the grandparents from here.

591
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:44,415
- Full day. 
- Yeah.

592
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:46,498
Well, you can skip eating this one if you want.

593
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,021
Just have cokes or something, it’s no big deal.

594
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,418
No, no way, you’re the main event today, my friend.

595
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,226
- Oh, good. 
- What’s good are the yams.

596
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:55,013
Definitely. Got some more marshmallows?

597
00:24:55,356 --> 00:24:57,922
Yeah, I can grab some. Hey, refill some coffees.

598
00:25:01,506 --> 00:25:03,666
So, no offense, but lame-o kiss.

599
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:04,695
What?

600
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:06,718
You and Jess, like a couple chickens pecking at each other.

601
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:07,881
Mind your own business.

602
00:25:08,003 --> 00:25:09,043
Well, it was right in front of me.

603
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:10,927
- So, I don’t need a review. 
- Sorry.

604
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:13,477
I’m just not good with the public displays.

605
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,859
You didn’t have that problem with Dean.

606
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:17,547
I know, but now I just feel like everybody’s watching me.

607
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:19,395
- People are not watching you. 
- You were watching me.

608
00:25:19,524 --> 00:25:21,885
I created you. It’s biologically predetermined that I watch you.

609
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:24,542
I just don’t know how this whole second boyfriend thing is supposed to go.

610
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:26,857
He’s your first second boyfriend. Give it time.

611
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:29,068
The whole town got used to me with Dean, it’s just weird.

612
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:31,875
It’ll get easier. You’re gonna have hundreds of men in your life.

613
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:32,858
Gee, thanks.

614
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:35,091
Maybe not hundreds, but a couple, three, more.

615
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:36,437
- It’ll get easier. 
- I guess.

616
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:38,520
Honey, they’ll adjust to seeing you with Jess.

617
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:40,118
And then there’s Dean. What do I do about him?

618
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:42,565
Well, you know, he’ll be moving on, too.

619
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:45,642
Right, of course he will, yeah.

620
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:46,831
We’re outta here.

621
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:48,054
Time to walk some of this off.

622
00:25:48,265 --> 00:25:50,466
Oh, we’d have to walk to China to walk all of it off.

623
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:51,526
Which way’s China?

624
00:25:51,644 --> 00:25:52,969
Thataway. Have a good night.

625
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:56,523
Thanks. By the way, that was some half-assed kiss you two had.

626
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:59,196
You gotta give it a little something, honey.

627
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:01,152
- Bye Babette. Bye Morey. 
- Bye.

628
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:03,697
The whole town is watching.

629
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:10,748
- You ready for this? 
- Of course.

630
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:11,940
Even with the Cold War?

631
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:14,199
That’s been going on for thirty-four years? I can manage.

632
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:16,099
It’s been a bit colder these past few weeks.

633
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:17,599
Oh no, I’m fine, you know why?

634
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,758
Because in two hours – and I do plan on extricating us from here

635
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:23,189
in exactly two hours – the night will be over

636
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:25,295
and I won’t have to see them again until next year.

637
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:27,102
Oh, start your stopwatch.

638
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:29,018
- Hello. 
- Hi Grandma. Happy Thanksgiving.

639
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:31,290
Thank you, Rory. Happy Thanksgiving, Lorelai.

640
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:32,310
Happy Thanksgiving.

641
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:35,714
One hour, fifty-nine minutes, and forty seconds.

642
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:37,701
Oh, wow, it’s a piano player.

643
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:39,647
That’s Brad. I found him at Nordstrom’s.

644
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:40,512
Was he on sale?

645
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:43,061
I thought a little background music would add a nice touch.

646
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:44,337
He knows every song ever written.

647
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:45,889
Free Bird! Hi Brad.

648
00:26:46,012 --> 00:26:47,981
Lorelai, please. Now come along, everyone’s here.

649
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:50,794
We’re all here.

650
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,697
Oh, good. Happy Thanksgiving, Rory.

651
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:54,740
Happy Thanksgiving, Grandpa.

652
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:55,781
- Lorelai. 
- Dad.

653
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:58,918
These are our guests, Natalie and Douglas Swope.

654
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:00,568
- You two have met. 
- Yes, at the auction.

655
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,817
- Good to see you again. 
- Yes.

656
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:03,518
- Nice to meet you. 
- Yes, you, too.

657
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:04,234
Same here.

658
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:06,226
And this is our international contingent,

659
00:27:06,687 --> 00:27:08,361
Claude and Monique Clemenceau.

660
00:27:08,664 --> 00:27:09,949
They’re just in from France.

661
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:12,141
Ah, Clemenceau, I’d have guessed Spain.

662
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:19,160
- Monique, voici ma fille et ma petite fille. 
- Ah. Elles sont si jolies.

663
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:22,724
My Monique speaks only French, so please excuse the inconvenience.

664
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:24,445
Oh, no, that’s fine. I love French.

665
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:27,057
She really wants to learn English, perhaps tonight will inspire her.

666
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:30,006
Je leur ai dit que tu voulais apprendre l’anglais.

667
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:33,948
L’anglais, oui, je veux l'apprendre, mais je suis tellement paresseuse.

668
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,435
Ah, ça prends du temps, Monique. Ah, t'en fais pas.

669
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:38,115
Merci.

670
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:41,092
Oh, no no no. That’s why I love it when the Clemenceaus visit.

671
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,629
It gives me the opportunity to haul out my rusty French.

672
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:46,975
Your French is wonderful, Richard. It always has been.

673
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:48,936
Oh, non, tu es tres gentil.

674
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,564
- Please, sit, sit, sit. 
- Merci.

675
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,262
So, Rory, you speak French at all?

676
00:27:53,451 --> 00:27:55,535
- Just a tiny little bit. 
- Un tout petit peu?

677
00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:57,916
- Oui, un tout petit peu. 
- And you, my dear?

678
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:01,557
Even less. Uh, voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir?

679
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:02,877
- That’s about it. 
- Lorelai.

680
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,466
- Oh my God. 
- It’s just a joke.

681
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,364
Asking my friend to go to bed with you is a joke?

682
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,274
- It’s a song. 
- It’s just a joke, Dad.

683
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,409
Oh, je vois, c’est une chanson pop.

684
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:12,631
It’s a pop song, ah, Monique... I did not know that.

685
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:16,067
- Lady Marmalade. 
- It’s very rich. It’s very, very funny.

686
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,071
Oh, well, thank you.

687
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:18,401
You need a drink, oui?

688
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,307
Very astute, Claude. Martini with a twist, Dad.

689
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:21,244
All right.

690
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:23,303
Is this your first American Thanksgiving, Claude?

691
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,719
It is, it is. I’ve seen it in the movies.

692
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:28,316
People seem to eat and eat and eat until they can’t eat anymore.

693
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:29,135
That’s about it.

694
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:32,499
It’s about giving thanks, gets you thinking about the good things.

695
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:34,761
We have a lot to give thanks for in this country.

696
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:35,592
Definitely.

697
00:28:35,677 --> 00:28:37,696
Me, I start each day giving thanks for three things –

698
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:40,727
Cuban cigars, French champagne, and gorgeous women.

699
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,876
And I must give extra thanks for the extraordinary group here tonight.

700
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:45,709
Douglas, Richard, leave us, won’t you?

701
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,112
- What? 
- Just another joke.

702
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:50,000
- Oh, I missed another joke? 
- You have your mother’s wit.

703
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:51,617
Sometimes I wish she’d give it back.

704
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,912
Emily mentioned that you were coming from another function?

705
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:55,417
No, this is your second dinner?

706
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:57,163
- Fourth, actually. 
- Fourth?

707
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:59,335
Oh, thank you for fitting us in, Lorelai.

708
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:01,864
Don’t worry, Dad. You’re the main event.

709
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:03,646
An hour and fifty six minutes.

710
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:09,811
Beautiful table, Emily. You’ve outdone yourself yet again.

711
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,008
Oh, it’s nothing.

712
00:29:11,234 --> 00:29:13,267
Well, is everyone settled? Is everyone comfy?

713
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:14,773
- Yes. 
- Yes, Dad, we’re fine.

714
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,610
Well, then, let’s get going.

715
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:21,675
- Gorgeous. 
- Oh, wonderful.

716
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:24,265
Is it for us or the whole neighborhood?

717
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:27,897
Very nice.

718
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,123
- Oh, ho, who gets the big piece? 
- I’m sorry?

719
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:34,236
Aren’t you supposed to keep carving?

720
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:35,770
That was strictly ceremonial.

721
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:37,337
- Ceremonial? 
- Ceremonial.

722
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:39,073
- Cérémoniel. 
- Cérémoniel.

723
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:40,620
Please, start on the salads everyone.

724
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,346
Is there anything ceremonial about the salads?

725
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:44,075
Do we carve a crouton, then have them taken away?

726
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:46,774
- No, no ceremony. 
- Salad’s great, Grandma.

727
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:48,695
I’m surprised you can eat at this point, even salad.

728
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:49,708
There’s still room.

729
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:52,233
And if there isn’t room, we’ll add on. I know a good contractor.

730
00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:54,536
She’s like your Jerry Lewis. She’s very, very funny.

731
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:57,271
Rory, did your grandmother say you were a high school senior?

732
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,830
So you’re going through this horrible period of applying to college.

733
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,422
It’s not so horrible.

734
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:04,674
She’s got it pretty well covered.

735
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:05,387
That’s right.

736
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:07,614
- All your applications are in? 
- I’ve applied.

737
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,601
We have a grandson your age, he’s going through hell.

738
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:13,237
He’s already been turned down for early admission to Stanford, his dream.

739
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:14,326
Took it pretty hard.

740
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:17,276
Children put so much stress on themselves these days.

741
00:30:17,512 --> 00:30:18,546
It’s pretty stressful.

742
00:30:18,688 --> 00:30:20,117
He’s waiting to hear from his backups.

743
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:22,592
I have a grandson who lives with his mother in Orlando,

744
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:24,675
you know, he’s going through a very similar thing, poor boy.

745
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,241
How do they like Orlando, Claude?

746
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:28,325
Well, it’s all Mickey Mouse this and Mickey Mouse that,

747
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:30,226
- you know. They want to die. 
- That’s too bad.

748
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:31,603
Where did you apply, dear?

749
00:30:31,782 --> 00:30:33,246
- Harvard. 
- No word yet?

750
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:34,860
I’m not supposed to hear back for awhile.

751
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:36,764
- Where else? 
- Where else?

752
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,398
Where else did you apply? Your alternates?

753
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,720
We’re so curious, it’s like we’ve been going through this ourselves.

754
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:43,544
Well, I’m pretty much counting on Harvard.

755
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:45,155
Well, you didn’t apply to just Harvard, did you?

756
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:47,026
Well, no.

757
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:48,207
No?

758
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:50,175
- Am I prying? 
- No.

759
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,750
We applied elsewhere?

760
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,205
You can’t just apply to one place.

761
00:30:53,297 --> 00:30:54,495
Chilton wouldn’t allow that.

762
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:55,724
- Is that true? 
- Pretty much.

763
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,724
Why didn’t you tell me that?

764
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:59,617
- I was going to. 
- You have to be safe.

765
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,291
My grandson – six schools.

766
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:02,340
Same with Dustin.

767
00:31:02,781 --> 00:31:05,915
- Where else did you apply? 
- Just at some other schools.

768
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:07,885
Well, if you’re aiming at Harvard, that would be Princeton,

769
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:10,005
Yale, maybe Vassar, Wesleyan.

770
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:12,146
Certainly Yale because of Richard’s connections, yes?

771
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,298
I would assume so.

772
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:14,809
Those are the kinds of places, yup.

773
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:16,688
The kinds of places or the places?

774
00:31:16,912 --> 00:31:17,998
Rory?

775
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:19,637
Princeton...

776
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:22,575
Yale.

777
00:31:23,303 --> 00:31:24,659
- Yale? 
- Yes?

778
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:25,474
Yale, Dad?

779
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:27,691
Oh, this is the first I’m hearing about it, Lorelai.

780
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:28,971
- Oh, bull. 
- Mom.

781
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,425
- Lorelai. 
- You did this.

782
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:33,824
I haven’t discussed this awful subject since the debacle at the campus.

783
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:36,238
- You forced her hand. 
- I did nothing of the sort.

784
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,133
Mom, wait.

785
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,641
You made it seem like you’d be deeply hurt if she didn’t apply to Yale,

786
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,105
and she’s very sensitive, so that’s as good as forcing her hand.

787
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:43,134
Lorelai, really.

788
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:45,409
You wanted her to go to Yale instead of Harvard, didn’t you?

789
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:46,421
That wasn’t a secret.

790
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:48,935
Lorelai ne veut pas que Rory aille à Yale.

791
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:50,999
Je suis désolé de ce qui ce passe ici.

792
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:53,400
- Stick to English, Dad. 
- Grandpa didn’t force my hand.

793
00:31:53,553 --> 00:31:54,911
Honey, you weren’t aware he was doing it.

794
00:31:55,064 --> 00:31:56,508
She is not a puppet, Lorelai.

795
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:58,587
- I needed a backup. 
- But why Yale?

796
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,743
I could live at home.

797
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:00,943
- You. 
- What?

798
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:02,561
You got to her. That was your thing.

799
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:05,571
- I’m afraid we started this. 
- This is not your doing, Natalie.

800
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,680
Encore une fois, je suis désolé.

801
00:32:07,824 --> 00:32:09,913
- I never spoke to Rory about that. 
- I don’t believe you.

802
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:11,546
I figured it out on my own, Mom.

803
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,577
You’re saying there have been no conversations, no emails?

804
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:15,699
- I can read a map. 
- This is unbelievable.

805
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:18,065
And past indelicate. We have guests.

806
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:20,579
Yes, I’m sorry, I apologize, I’m sorry you have to see this.

807
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:23,246
This is paranoia, Lorelai. There’s been no conspiring.

808
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:24,464
I’m not being paranoid, Mom.

809
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:27,291
For seventeen years, she was going to Harvard, and now all of a sudden,

810
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:29,181
she’s applied to Yale and she’s mimicking everything you say.

811
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:30,441
This is just crazy.

812
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,324
Elle a dit que, ‘c’est de la folie.’

813
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:35,960
Excuse me, please.

814
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:43,892
It’s freezing out here.

815
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:46,012
It’s Jamaica compared to in there.

816
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:51,286
It’s just an alternative to Harvard, a backup.

817
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,964
- It changes nothing. 
- No, no.

818
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:56,786
- Lorelai. 
- Mom, I don’t wanna talk.

819
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,228
Do you believe we had nothing to do with this?

820
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:00,901
Just for a second, Mom, please.

821
00:33:01,008 --> 00:33:03,390
Just let me digest this for a second.

822
00:33:04,993 --> 00:33:06,314
All this Yale stuff...

823
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:11,679
You can’t even let Rory have one piece of our lives,

824
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:14,249
even if it’s her choice. You hate us that much.

825
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:25,801
Goodbye, drive safe.

826
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:29,893
Excellent Thanksgiving, Mama.

827
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:31,055
I think people had fun.

828
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:34,209
And it was nice of you to only charge half price on the chair that Yung Hee broke.

829
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:35,177
That was my cost.

830
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,374
That why it was nice.

831
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:38,889
I guess I’ll be going.

832
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,568
All right. You did a good job.

833
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:42,023
Thank you for your time, David.

834
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:44,025
You’re welcome, Mrs. Kim. I enjoyed it.

835
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:45,580
- Yes, thank you. 
- You’re welcome.

836
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:46,426
Here.

837
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,986
Some rice, spinach, lots of tofurkey.

838
00:33:49,482 --> 00:33:51,198
- Great, thanks. 
- And something for your time.

839
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,400
That’s very nice, thank you.

840
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:55,514
- Happy Thanksgiving. 
- Goodbye.

841
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,585
Keep clearing. I’m going to start on the kitchen.

842
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,595
Oh, Mama, look. Dave’s bible. He forgot it.

843
00:34:03,784 --> 00:34:05,416
He’s gonna need this, too. I’ll run it out to him.

844
00:34:05,606 --> 00:34:06,585
Wait.

845
00:34:07,901 --> 00:34:08,689
We’re gonna miss him.

846
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,927
Let me see that.

847
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:21,086
‘This bible belongs to God, but is being used by Dave Rygalski.’

848
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:25,028
Go on.

849
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,848
Wow, you run really quiet.

850
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:40,030
Sorry, I’m sorry about everything.

851
00:34:40,522 --> 00:34:41,776
- What? 
- The whole night.

852
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:44,167
I had no idea she’d make you play five straight hours without a break.

853
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:45,869
- It’s okay. 
- Your hands must be dead.

854
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,450
They’re just a little numb.

855
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,250
But I’ve got these Kurt Cobain calluses now, how cool is that?

856
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,899
But this whole thing, this whole charade,

857
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,881
the fake flier and everything, it was too much.

858
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,300
Lane, it’s fine. And that flier – I’ve gotten like three other calls for paying gigs.

859
00:34:57,377 --> 00:34:58,591
I should be paying you a commission.

860
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,595
Oh, that’s not necessary.

861
00:34:59,825 --> 00:35:01,432
And check it out – twenty bucks.

862
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:02,437
Wow, she liked you.

863
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:04,244
We’ll put it towards our first real date.

864
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:07,706
Really? After all this – the marathon hymns,

865
00:35:07,926 --> 00:35:09,508
the weak punch, the crabby Koreans,

866
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,009
you still wanna go out on a date with me?

867
00:35:25,028 --> 00:35:25,991
I’ve gotta go...

868
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:30,168
But I’m gonna call you tomorrow.

869
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,000
Are you mad?

870
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,740
- No, I’m not mad. 
- You seem mad.

871
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:42,571
I’m not mad.

872
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:43,651
What are you feeling?

873
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:45,723
I wouldn’t know how to word it.

874
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:46,610
Try.

875
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,926
See, my head knows that whichever one of these places you go,

876
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:56,944
Harvard, Princeton, Yale...

877
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:58,858
it’s gonna be great.

878
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:00,548
It’s gonna be awesome,

879
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,690
and you’re gonna come out on the other side an even more amazing you.

880
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:08,269
But I just wish my head could sit down

881
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:10,931
and have a chat with that gnawing feeling in my gut

882
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,209
that’s there every time my parents get involved in anything

883
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,501
and tell it, it’s gonna be okay.

884
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:19,385
It’s gonna be okay.

885
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:21,801
Nice try.

886
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,431
What else are we putting in the pot? Come on, let’s think of something.

887
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,868
A raspberry, a deep-fried raspberry. How ‘bout a rasquat?

888
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:41,838
- Cake! 
- Cake! Deep-fried cake!

889
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:44,823
Dibs on the deep-fried cake!

890
00:36:45,111 --> 00:36:47,000
You haven’t even eaten your deep-fried biscotti.

891
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,362
Hey, Sookie.

892
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,762
Ah, hi there.

893
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:52,832
- Are you okay? 
- This tastes good.

894
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,726
Yeah, it looks like they’re deep-frying –

895
00:36:54,818 --> 00:36:55,391
Everything.

896
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:57,533
Vegetables, mashed potatoes,

897
00:36:57,788 --> 00:37:01,204
butter, pickles, salt, a napkin.

898
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,759
And yet, you’re very serene.

899
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,123
You’re practically floating.

900
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,334
Well, you caught me at a good time, ladies.

901
00:37:06,446 --> 00:37:08,520
I’ve already gone through the five stages of grieving.

902
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,188
Denial, anger...

903
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:15,325
I don’t remember these two, but they were served on the rocks with salt!

904
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:19,308
Now, I’m just happily enscotched in acceptance.

905
00:37:20,492 --> 00:37:22,504
- Enscotched... 
- Ensconced?

906
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,444
Ensconced – that’s it!

907
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:29,308
I do believe I heard Phil suggest throwing Junior in.

908
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:30,563
- Junior? 
- His nephew.

909
00:37:30,702 --> 00:37:34,000
- I chimed in on that one. 
- What happened over there?

910
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:37,829
Mm, about a half-hour ago they set the lawn on fire.

911
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:41,341
But Phil says it’s okay and everything ‘cause it’ll grow back twice as lush.

912
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,117
Though that’s what he said when he broke my salad bowl

913
00:37:44,332 --> 00:37:46,196
that I brought back from Belgium.

914
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:49,191
That’ll maybe grow back, too, huh?

915
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:53,498
Phil is a riot. Am I crying or laughing?

916
00:37:53,615 --> 00:37:54,649
- Laughing. 
- Good.

917
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:56,687
Who’s that?

918
00:37:57,311 --> 00:38:00,731
It’s Lane. It just says ‘bible kiss bible’.

919
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:01,454
What does that mean?

920
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:03,640
I have no idea. Good band name, though.

921
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:06,641
Honey, we should get going? You gonna be okay?

922
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:07,588
I’m Sookie.

923
00:38:07,824 --> 00:38:09,862
Yeah, I know, but you’re gonna be okay, right?

924
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,777
- You’ll go to bed soon. 
- Unless they deep-fried it.

925
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:12,847
I’m sure they haven’t.

926
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,468
Okay, we’ll see you tomorrow.

927
00:38:17,968 --> 00:38:20,129
- Poor thing. 
- Oh, she may not remember any of it.

928
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,960
- Deep-fried shoe! 
- Deep-fried shoe!

929
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:29,518
- Get more trash cans. 
- I don’t need more.

930
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:32,120
You make me run around town for a place to dump this.

931
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:33,717
Just dump it in one of Taylor’s bins.

932
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:36,923
It gets it out of here and it’ll drive Taylor crazy. It’s a win-win.

933
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,362
- Hi guys. 
- We’re out of food.

934
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:40,430
Oh, please, we’re not eating for a year.

935
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,449
Or ‘til tomorrow morning.

936
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:43,211
Whichever comes first. Hi Saint Nick.

937
00:38:43,516 --> 00:38:44,900
Tell him he needs to get more trash cans.

938
00:38:44,957 --> 00:38:45,648
Just go.

939
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:48,070
- You got any coffee? 
- That I’ve got. Come on in.

940
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,957
Hey, did I see flames coming from Sookie’s place about a half-hour ago?

941
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,047
Yeah, why?

942
00:38:58,065 --> 00:38:59,416
I still say you should get more tra...

943
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:11,137
Later.

944
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:25,996
- Nothing to say? 
- Guess not.

945
00:39:26,232 --> 00:39:27,869
That’s funny, you usually have something to say.

946
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:29,375
Guess I’m all talked out.

947
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,383
What’s the matter, Jess? Why you walking away?

948
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:33,257
It’s getting a little West Side Story here, Dean,

949
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,155
and I gotta warn you, my dancing skills are not up to snuff.

950
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:38,167
But now’s your chance, there’s no one else around.

951
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,738
Go home. Cool off.

952
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:41,884
Come on, make one of your Boy Scout references,

953
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:45,268
or a good Farmer John joke. I got my Doose’s Market apron with me –

954
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,347
you want me to put it on, give you a little inspiration?

955
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:49,231
I don’t get it, what happened – you suddenly like me now?

956
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:51,664
Oh yeah, I was just about to invite you camping.

957
00:39:51,741 --> 00:39:53,062
Good, okay, now we’re getting somewhere.

958
00:39:53,313 --> 00:39:55,412
- I’m not gonna fight you, Dean. 
- Why?

959
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:58,756
‘Cause if I fight you, Rory’s gonna think it’s my fault,

960
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:00,509
so just forget it, okay? Just forget it.

961
00:40:00,713 --> 00:40:02,098
Go home. Let it rest.

962
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:04,567
So Rory’s got a nice little hold on you now, huh?

963
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:05,500
Geez.

964
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,371
- Don’t do that. 
- How does it feel?

965
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:11,091
It feels like I’m with Rory and you’re not.

966
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,980
You know, when all this happened with you and me and Rory,

967
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:15,996
I figured I’d just stay out of everyone’s way, that that would be easiest.

968
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,816
But now, I’m looking at you and I’m thinking,

969
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:21,102
I’m gonna run from him?

970
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,606
The Glad Man.

971
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:26,079
This is my town, I’m not hiding.

972
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,044
And I don’t have be remotely calm around you anymore,

973
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:30,410
and I like that feeling.

974
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,402
I like it a lot.

975
00:40:36,806 --> 00:40:37,942
Happy Thanksgiving, Jess.

976
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:52,979
So, how did the four dinners work out?

977
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:54,988
You guys must feel more stuffed than you’ve ever been.

978
00:40:55,075 --> 00:40:57,180
I don’t know. Is this more stuffed than the great

979
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:59,007
Six Flags hot dog consumption of ‘99?

980
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,988
No, or the taffy binge of ’97.

981
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,186
Not by a long shot.

982
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,204
See, we didn’t eat at my parents because of the upset,

983
00:41:04,316 --> 00:41:06,021
so we really had three dinners, not four.

984
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:06,932
Which means...

985
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:08,931
- What? 
- We didn’t have to skip rolls.

986
00:41:09,048 --> 00:41:10,558
Oh yeah.

987
00:41:10,855 --> 00:41:13,585
- Hey, do you have any rolls left? 
- No. Come on.

988
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,207
Just a little something for the walk home.

989
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:18,832
I don’t see how you do it.

990
00:41:18,945 --> 00:41:19,964
You’re not us, are ya?

991
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,561
- Night Luke. 
- Night Luke.

992
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:22,330
Night.

993
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,475
This has been a nice Thanksgiving.

994
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:32,381
Very.

995
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:34,680
Nicer for some than others though.

996
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,086
Night Kirk!

997
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:39,488
Night.
