1
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,690
- I've got too much stuff. 
- What?

2
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:04,840
Stuff! And it's your fault.

3
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:08,201
You inculcated into me a tolerance for rampant consumerism.

4
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:08,982
What?

5
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,317
When did I become one of those girls with dozens of beauty products,

6
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:13,764
none of which are expendable?

7
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:15,464
It used to be a touch of mascara,

8
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:17,445
dab of Coppertone, zip, bam, boom, out the door.

9
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:19,095
I heard copper and boom.

10
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:22,094
Never mind. And what's going on? We're late.

11
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:23,451
I'm looking for the camera.

12
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:25,366
Oy vey, she's looking for the camera.

13
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:27,307
- I heard that. 
- That she hears.

14
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:31,255
It is my prerogative as your mother to record any event in my daughter's life

15
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,517
that I so choose. It's in the mother's handbook.

16
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:35,551
Does Luke know that you can't drive a stick?

17
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:36,190
Why?

18
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,376
Because you borrowed his truck and it's a stick.

19
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:39,825
I can drive a stick.

20
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,960
You can stir coffee with a stick, but you can't drive a stick.

21
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:46,040
Okay, I am glad I did not choose to record that particular moment

22
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:47,720
in my daughter's life 'cause that was just ugly.

23
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:49,174
I just want you to get there in one piece.

24
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,611
- You look out for me. 
- Let's hit the road.

25
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:57,212
Oh, wait, wait, this is it! This is the precise moment that I've been looking for.

26
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,225
This is my daughter going off to college, this is my shot!

27
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:00,868
Okay, fine.

28
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,612
Okay, I'm lining you up, now look candid.

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,486
Okay, see, the very definition of candid means

30
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,310
that the subject doesn't know the picture's being taken.

31
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:09,404
- So forget the camera's there. 
- I'll try.

32
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:11,298
- And smile. 
- Okay, okay.

33
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:15,496
- I'm not happy. 
- Why?

34
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:18,057
- It looks posed. 
- How about this?

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,346
Yeah, you know the stick we were talking about before?

36
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:22,157
It looks like it's somewhere else now.

37
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,303
You're having serious Annie Leibovitz delusions here.

38
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:25,972
But it just looks like you're standing in the house.

39
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,775
No one will know that you're going off to college.

40
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:28,742
Shall I hold a sign?

41
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,370
Or you could do the "going off to college" walk.

42
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,254
- The what? 
- The walk, the this.

43
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:36,283
You look like Alfalfa coming to pick up Darla.

44
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:39,370
Here, hold some of your stuff. At least it'll look like you're moving or something.

45
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,197
It looks like you're taking out the trash.

46
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,677
Okay, that's it, we're going.

47
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:47,358
All right. I'll just have to make do with one of the pictures I already took.

48
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:48,116
Good.

49
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:51,311
I'll put it on the computer and then superimpose an important person

50
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,738
standing next to you seeing you off, like Kissinger

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,017
or Lady Bird Johnson or Pat Summerall or something.

52
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:56,928
Pat Summerall?

53
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,434
You think of somebody better.

54
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:00,584
- Orson Welles. 
- It can't be a dead person.

55
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,938
- Pat Summerall's dead. 
- No, he's not.

56
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,546
Pat Summerall is dead.

57
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,871
No, I'm telling you, he's not.

58
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:09,282
- Lady Bird Johnson is dead. 
- No, she's not.

59
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:10,665
- How much you wanna bet? 
- Five bucks.

60
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:12,764
- Let's google him right now. 
- Mom, Yale?

61
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,673
Yeah, Yale can wait for us to google Pat Summerall.

62
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,390
Come.

63
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,599
Where are your priorities?

64
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:15,546
Hey, Luke.

65
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:17,737
Hey, Rory. Isn't today Yale?

66
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,801
Yeah, I'm going right now.

67
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:21,470
You look so calm. How do you feel?

68
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:24,541
A little nervous, but a last Luke's fix before I go will help.

69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,614
Well, today is whatever you want on the house.

70
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:27,798
Wow, I feel important.

71
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:29,785
You are important. Where's your mom?

72
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,799
She's coming. She's having a wee bit of trouble with your truck.

73
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,286
What is she doing?

74
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,232
Well, she backed the truck out of our driveway all fine and everything,

75
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:43,774
but once she hit the road, she couldn't get it out of reverse, so she...

76
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:44,566
Backed it here?

77
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:46,897
Slow but steady.

78
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,873
Something's wrong with your truck.

79
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,636
Nothing's wrong with my truck. Stop the truck.

80
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,581
- It won't go out of reverse. 
- You can't drive a stick.

81
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:56,272
I can't drive an uncooperative stick.

82
00:04:56,353 --> 00:04:58,206
My stick's not uncooperative. Come on, hit the brakes.

83
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,982
Okay, good luck.

84
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:07,243
I don't think it's gonna happen.

85
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:11,713
- This is a misogynistic truck! 
- What?

86
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:14,462
It's anti-woman, it's gender-selective,

87
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:18,830
it's "Oh, let's drink a beer and watch the game and hike our shorts up."

88
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,393
I changed my mind, you can't borrow my truck.

89
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,810
- But it's full of our stuff. 
- You should've hired movers.

90
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,648
You could've said no when I asked to borrow the truck.

91
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:30,100
- You said you could drive a stick. 
- Yeah, not the Joe Sixpack of sticks.

92
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:35,444
Not the "Oh, let's scratch our bellies and eat some corn nuts and pick our teeth."

93
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,598
- Really, Luke, I can drive it. 
- Okay, fine.

94
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:42,316
Just be careful and have it back by four.

95
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:45,172
- Four-ish it is. 
- Four, I need it at four.

96
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:46,815
- Give or take a few min... 
- Four.

97
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:50,123
- God, he's so possessive about the stupid truck. 
- It's my truck, I possess it!

98
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,673
I'm just kidding. I'll have it back by four, calm down.

99
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:53,616
Okay, I'm just...

100
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,866
I'm not in much of a kidding mood with all this other stuff going on.

101
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:59,872
- Divorce papers. Fun, huh? 
- Zero fun. Sorry, Luke.

102
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:01,731
It's not that I wasn't expecting them, it's just...

103
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,393
the law firm that Nicole works for sent them.

104
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:06,523
I called with a simple question they could've answered over the phone,

105
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,053
but they insisted on sending someone down to see me.

106
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,455
I take it you're not looking forward to that.

107
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:11,740
I'm about to build a moat of fire.

108
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:13,865
- Here you go, Rory. 
- Thanks, Caesar.

109
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:16,788
Since we were short on time, I had them make us something to go.

110
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:19,082
- My Yale special. 
- Oh, share, share.

111
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,340
Sausage wrapped in a pancake tied together with bacon.

112
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:23,865
- You made that up? 
- I don't know how I do it.

113
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,602
- Here. 
- What's this?

114
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,829
A shift diagram for the truck, nice and simple. D is for drive, R is for...

115
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,703
- The R in drive! 
- R is for reverse.

116
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:33,234
- Right, reverse. 
- And one is...

117
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:34,417
The loneliest number that you'll ever know!

118
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:35,456
The first gear.

119
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,089
- I know, Luke. Really, I can handle it. 
- I hope so.

120
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,025
Thanks, Luke.

121
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:40,315
Good luck, Rory.

122
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:44,135
- Oh, goody, a guy in a suit. 
- Good luck to you.

123
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,083
- Mr. Danes? 
- Unfortunately.

124
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,052
I'm Russell Bynes. I'm with Blodgett, Sage, Albet, Pettruccio,

125
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,807
Stein, Lemming, and Stein, attorneys for Nicole Diana Leahy.

126
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,665
And the sun just went down, thanks for coming.

127
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:57,207
- Pardon me? 
- You're wasting your time.

128
00:06:57,345 --> 00:07:01,308
I had a simple question, where do I sign? It didn't require a personal visit.

129
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:04,185
Whoa, there's no place to sign because this is just a document

130
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,571
informing the defendant of the type of action being filed.

131
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:07,995
What are you talking about? Who's the defendant?

132
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,367
- You are. 
- Oh my God.

133
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:10,253
Didn't you read the papers?

134
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,597
Yeah, the Red Sox lost by three, Bush is at the ranch chatting up a Swiss dude.

135
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,372
- The divorce papers. 
- I know what you meant.

136
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:18,630
Look, I didn't kill anyone. Nicole and I just kind of accidentally got married

137
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:20,662
and now we want out. We both want the same thing.

138
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,735
- Don't try to play me, Mr. Danes. 
- I'm too busy for this.

139
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:25,254
Fine, because I should just be dealing with your legal representation.

140
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,512
I don't believe this.

141
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:30,573
Not giving us your lawyer's information is only going to prolong the process.

142
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,607
Okay, if I give you my lawyer's name, will you leave?

143
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:34,066
- I will leave. 
- Okay, you ready?

144
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:36,504
His name is Don Dewey. He works at the firm of Dewey...

145
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,325
- Dewey. 
- Cheatham...

146
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,407
- Cheatham. 
- And Howe.

147
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:39,801
Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe.

148
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,632
- That was very immature. 
- Yeah, well, tickled me.

149
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:47,097
My bosses are gonna wanna hear this.

150
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:48,657
Oh, come on, they've heard that one before.

151
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:53,584
Oh, hey, if you want Don's number, it's 555-5555.

152
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,686
- I thought you were gone. 
- Nothing's where it says it is.

153
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:00,783
It's gonna be fine.

154
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:21,411
- Nice score! 
- Thank you.

155
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,318
Oh, and later, I'll point out the seven or so fellow Yalies

156
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,531
who already hate you because your obnoxious mother

157
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:29,936
wouldn't let them park in the only open spot left.

158
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:31,529
Oh, goody. You get the truck here okay?

159
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:33,542
Oh, we had some bickering, but we made it.

160
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:34,954
Hello. Name?

161
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,354
Oh, hey. I was told it was okay to hold the spot.

162
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:42,640
A guy told me, I forget his name. He had, like, a jacket.

163
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:44,867
It's okay. I was just wondering what our newcomer's name is.

164
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,347
- Rory Gilmore. 
- Right, Rory Gilmore

165
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:49,398
Rory Gilmore, Rory Gilmore... there you are.

166
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,840
- Welcome to Yale. 
- Oh, hold the shake, hold the shake.

167
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:53,234
- Mom. 
- Wait, lens cap, lens cap.

168
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:54,882
- Sorry. 
- They all do this.

169
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:55,564
Shake.

170
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,779
Got it. Who are you?

171
00:08:57,939 --> 00:08:59,623
I'm Tess, I'm Rory's freshman counselor.

172
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:01,707
I'll be living in the building and be there for whatever she needs.

173
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,969
And you look twenty-one, convenient for beer runs.

174
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,198
I'll be giving a tour for Durfee girls you should not miss.

175
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:09,950
Oh, I know. Tour's at twelve, followed by the optional express lunch twelve to two,

176
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:11,814
which is all followed by the telecommunications orientation

177
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,606
and internet ID distribution, parents' reception eleven to one.

178
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:17,148
You memorized the schedule.

179
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,310
Yeah, she's not weird or anything, she just has a good memory.

180
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:20,728
And I see you brought your own mattress.

181
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,939
Oh, right. See, the guy...

182
00:09:23,682 --> 00:09:25,443
name, name, name. I forget his name.

183
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:30,087
Three syllables. He said it was okay, and he had, like, a mustache.

184
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,078
It's allowed as long as you make arrangements to dispose

185
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:33,805
of the one that was already there. Did you do that?

186
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,156
- Yes, we did. 
- Yes.

187
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:37,060
- Good. Get your camera ready. 
- Why?

188
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:39,466
- I'm giving Rory her key. 
- Thanks for the warning.

189
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:44,023
- See you at the tour. 
- Yes, Tess, thank you.

190
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,129
So, she's nice.

191
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:49,001
Yeah. I'm dying to see your room. Come on, grab a bag.

192
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:51,396
So, you made arrangements to get rid of the old mattress?

193
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:53,214
- Yes, I did. 
- Really?

194
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:58,195
Because it specifically says here that you're supposed to make arrangements

195
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:00,571
to have the old mattress picked up before arrival.

196
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:02,369
Ooh, very grand.

197
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,006
So, what time are the mattress guys coming?

198
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:06,357
Later today sometime.

199
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:07,909
So we have to wait in the room for them, or...

200
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:09,736
I think they just let themselves in. Here we are.

201
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:12,036
So do the mattress guys have their own key?

202
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:13,665
All right, I confess, I didn't call the mattress guys.

203
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,689
- What are we gonna do? 
- We'll find a dumpster.

204
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,481
Mom, they could trace it back to me.

205
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,305
- I'll be long gone by then. 
- Mom.

206
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:25,092
All right, we'll burn it before we dump it. A match, a little gasoline.

207
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:27,605
We're here five minutes and we're already contemplating felonies.

208
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:31,314
Just like I pictured it.

209
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,177
Did you see an emergency exit?

210
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:35,833
A fireplace, too! I wonder if it's woodburning.

211
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:39,654
It says here, "Upon arrival, please take note of the emergency exits."

212
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:42,408
Hey, hey, we could burn the mattress in there, save us a trip.

213
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,871
Man, a piece of my map ripped off.

214
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:45,874
Which one's your room?

215
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:47,538
I'm missing half of the Old Campus.

216
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,951
R.G. This is it.

217
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:51,701
If I have Old Campus activities today, I'm screwed.

218
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:54,809
Here it is.

219
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,557
Here's where you're going to be thinking all those impressive thoughts.

220
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,255
It's just waiting for your decorative stamp.

221
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:03,934
- And a little air freshener. 
- Where's the phone jack?

222
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,396
I don't know, Jack. Where is the pesky phone?

223
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:07,255
Mom.

224
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:08,786
You're one-note Nancy today.

225
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:11,265
Ah, here's a place to get replacement maps.

226
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,814
Holy cow, it's in Old Campus!

227
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:15,903
All right, that's it.

228
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:18,028
- Hey, what are you doing? 
- You just missed it.

229
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,026
Missed what?

230
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:21,315
Walking into your dorm suite for the first time. Do over.

231
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,644
What? We're short on time here and we haven't unloaded.

232
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,282
It doesn't matter. You're gonna be in the moment.

233
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:26,967
Mom.

234
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:29,682
You're gonna be in the moment or the rest of the map gets it.

235
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:32,379
No. Okay, I'm here, I swear.

236
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:33,686
You're not placating me?

237
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,009
I'll try. Really, I'm all here.

238
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:37,653
Good.

239
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:39,799
Oh, here's your suite.

240
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:41,022
Cool.

241
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,918
It is cool. My own space.

242
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:52,082
Well, yours and P.G.'s and J.B.'s and T.S.'s.

243
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,546
And a fireplace. Did you see the fireplace?

244
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:55,706
Was this do over justified or what?

245
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,807
You mentioned thoughts in here?

246
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,451
All the great ones you're gonna have.

247
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:02,776
- And air freshener? 
- That, too.

248
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:04,436
Thanks for putting me in the moment.

249
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,967
My pleasure.

250
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,595
It's something I would have not wanted to miss.

251
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:08,169
Good.

252
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,846
- And thank you. 
- For what?

253
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:13,391
For pretending that you're not at this moment thinking about missing your tour,

254
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,639
finding your phone jack, navigating the Old Campus.

255
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:16,597
It's my gift to you.

256
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:19,203
- Let's go unload and get you a new map. 
- Bless you.

257
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:32,447
Just keep in mind, guys, the dining hall hours are cast in stone - you snooze, you lose.

258
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,248
And it's a post-9/11 world, so your ID's are important.

259
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:39,130
You'll be asked for it a lot, so always have it, always, always.

260
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,976
It also operates the laundry machines and is also your meal card.

261
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:46,554
That's right, it's practically magic, so don't lose it.

262
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:49,564
If you're stupid enough to get ripped, I'm here to help,

263
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:52,135
but I do not hold buckets, if you get my drift.

264
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:56,322
Now, pay attention to street parking, it is severely restricted in most places.

265
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,248
Walk or take the shuttle when you can.

266
00:12:58,574 --> 00:12:59,559
First floor Durfee.

267
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:00,484
Third floor Bingham.

268
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:01,853
- They're babies. 
- Tots.

269
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,356
Third floor Bingham, through the gate, make a left.

270
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:08,242
Get an internet ID whether you think you'll use it or not.

271
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,917
It'll be your name at yale.edu, and there's no changing what you get.

272
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,273
Think there's gonna be a test?

273
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,579
Probably not.

274
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:19,035
Oh, you were joking. Good one.

275
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,002
No bottlenecks, girls.

276
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,824
There's about a hundred behind you waiting for the same stuff.

277
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:26,679
Do not get precious about your ID pictures.

278
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,375
They are what they are.

279
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:30,935
Did you get that down? They are what they are.

280
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,244
- I'll remember. 
- Next!

281
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,915
- That would be you. 
- What?

282
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,828
- It's picture time. 
- Oh, sorry.

283
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:40,069
I didn't think pictures were today. Do you mind if I take a second to...

284
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:40,852
One thousand and one.

285
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:42,035
Next!

286
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:49,121
Always have your keys. Never open the door to someone you don't know.

287
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,782
Walk in twos at night. That's it, any questions?

288
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:56,699
Later on, you'll have questions.

289
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:57,805
I'll be around.

290
00:13:58,558 --> 00:13:59,776
Now go do stuff.

291
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:29,518
Rory, you back?

292
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,973
- Who is that? 
- I don't know.

293
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:43,304
She just followed me in here like a puppy dog without saying a word.

294
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:44,284
Maybe she's lost.

295
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,552
Or maybe she's one of my new suitemates who I'm already off to a swell start with.

296
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:49,409
Do you know how vulnerable you are to venereal disease?

297
00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:51,560
All hail to the queen of the non-sequiturs.

298
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:53,926
This parent orientation I went to was a nonstop litany

299
00:14:53,981 --> 00:14:55,559
of the horrors awaiting college freshman.

300
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:58,181
You're supposed to carry a whistle, a flashlight, a crucifix,

301
00:14:58,339 --> 00:14:59,859
and a loaded Glock with you at all times.

302
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,304
We should go out there. She'll think we're hiding.

303
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:03,306
Okay, just don't shake hands with her. Bacteria.

304
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:03,833
Mom.

305
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,390
- Or tell her where you live. 
- Too late.

306
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:07,028
- Oh, you touched the doorknob. 
- Good grief.

307
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:11,238
- Say something. 
- What?

308
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:12,547
Anything. Go, go.

309
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,544
- I'm adopted. 
- You're up.

310
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:25,973
- What's your name? 
- Tanna Schrick.

311
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:27,426
Well, Tanna Schrick, good.

312
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:28,962
We're making some progress. Hi, Tanna Schrick.

313
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,128
I'm Lorelai, this is Rory. She'll be living here, too.

314
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:32,142
We're suitemates.

315
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:35,531
As they're ransacking your room, professional thieves typically start

316
00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:38,321
at the bottom drawer and work their way up. That way they don't have

317
00:15:38,378 --> 00:15:40,856
to close drawers before opening the next one. Saves time.

318
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:43,855
Okay. So, no storing your valuables in the bottom drawer.

319
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:45,792
Got that, Rory? Good tip, Tanna. Thanks.

320
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm not so great at extemporaneous speaking,

321
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,904
so I've memorized some quick conversational facts I can whip out at a moment's notice.

322
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:53,845
Oh, when I get to know you better, I'll memorize some facts

323
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,386
that are more specific to your person.

324
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,251
- Tanna, how old are you? 
- Sixteen.

325
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:58,874
- Sixteen? 
- On Tuesday.

326
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:00,747
- Happy birthday, Doogie. 
- Thank you.

327
00:16:01,356 --> 00:16:02,698
And, where are your parents?

328
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,087
Oh, at the hotel. Mom's napping, Dad's getting a schvitz.

329
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,744
Okay, well, we still have some more stuff to do,

330
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:11,494
but maybe your parents will be here when I get back. I'd love to meet them.

331
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:14,224
Yeah, well, they make a very good first impression.

332
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:16,537
I'm sure they do. See you later, kiddo.

333
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:17,715
Bye.

334
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,936
- Oh, hey, Rory? 
- Yeah?

335
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:22,190
You nervous?

336
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,109
- Oh yeah. 
- Okay, good.

337
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,994
- Odd, but nice. 
- I'll take it.

338
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:36,186
- So... this is it. 
- This is it.

339
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:38,989
- Learn a lot of stuff. 
- I'll try.

340
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:41,841
And, you know, keep in touch.

341
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:44,452
We'll at least exchange Christmas cards.

342
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,751
With a letter detailing what's happened over the year.

343
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:48,102
- And a current photo. 
- Don't joke!

344
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,915
- You started it. 
- I was masking my pain.

345
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:51,928
- You'll see plenty of me. 
- It's not enough.

346
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:52,644
How about tons?

347
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:55,476
That's better. I love you, did you know that?

348
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,062
I always suspected it.

349
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,337
Oh, excuse me. 

350
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:03,737
- A little fridge. 
- It's cute.

351
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,874
- I want one. 
- Go get yourself one.

352
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,951
- For you, I want one for you. 
- I don't need one.

353
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,520
For sodas and stuff when things are closed. Late night cram sessions.

354
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,056
I guess it would come in handy.

355
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:15,659
Oh, let's see what these people have going on.

356
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:16,186
Mom.

357
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,173
A rug! A rug for your room to make it cozy.

358
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:24,730
- And a vase of flowers. 
- The flowers will just die.

359
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:27,245
They have a vase of the most beautiful fake flowers I've ever seen.

360
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:29,554
- Trash cans! 
- Oh, you're right.

361
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:32,084
- And a fan. I have been remiss. 
- No, you haven't.

362
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,477
I have got another trip to make today.

363
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:34,875
No, Mom, you've done enough today.

364
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:38,167
I want you fully outfitted and settled for your first night or I won't sleep.

365
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,841
- We can get it all later. 
- No, no.

366
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,335
Now go unpack the skimpy amount of stuff I've gotten you so far

367
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:43,968
and I'll be back in a couple of hours. Copper boom.

368
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:45,764
What?

369
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,496
It's what you said to me this morning when you were trying to speed me up.

370
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,904
But you missed a bunch of stuff in between.

371
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:50,859
I think it's catchy. Go, go, unpack.

372
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,053
- Copper boom! 
- Copper boom!

373
00:17:58,191 --> 00:17:58,652
Mom!

374
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:00,035
Copper boom!

375
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:05,861
Hey, Luke.

376
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:08,760
- Oops. 
- Shoot me.

377
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:10,480
Now, or maybe later so you're surprised?

378
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:16,055
Mr. Danes, a marriage contract is a contract just like any other.

379
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,718
As the higher wage earner, Nicole wants a fair settlement.

380
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,156
But I want nothing from her, so there's nothing to settle,

381
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:23,536
- Mr... what's your name again? 
- My name is Stein.

382
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:24,975
- I thought you were Stein. 
- I'm Stein as well.

383
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:27,453
- Then I'm confused. 
- Mr. Danes, I'm an impatient man,

384
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:29,649
I'm a busy man, I'm a sensible man, I'm a skeptical man.

385
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:31,933
Oh, you're four different men, huh? Well, are they all named Stein, too?

386
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:35,078
If there's one thing I've learned in this business, it's that no one wants nothing.

387
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,494
Why won't you hire a lawyer?

388
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:39,163
Why? Because lawyers waste time and money.

389
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:41,353
They're needless middlemen who slither into people's lives

390
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:43,340
when they're at their most vulnerable so they can clamp on

391
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:46,679
and suck like leeches until everyone but them is distraught and penniless.

392
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:48,134
I can see why the marriage went bad.

393
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:50,447
Here's fair warning, Mr. Danes - if you don't hire a lawyer,

394
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:52,372
you could wind up getting absolutely nothing.

395
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:53,851
- That's what I want! 
- There he goes again.

396
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:55,434
Maybe we should get Sage and Albet into this.

397
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:56,592
Pettruccio, too.

398
00:18:57,738 --> 00:19:00,841
- They're gonna multiply like the matrix. 
- Oh, well...

399
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:03,088
- Tell them, Lorelai. 
- Tell them what?

400
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,142
- Who's this? 
- This is Lorelai.

401
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:06,878
- Are you an attorney? 
- No, she's carbon-based.

402
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:07,722
And what's her role?

403
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:09,586
Be my character witness or something.

404
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:13,011
Right, okay. Well, I can vouch for this man.

405
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:18,909
I mean, I know he cared for Nicole, and apparently they both got a little rash.

406
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:21,829
I mean, not in 'apply to affected area twice daily' rash,

407
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,839
I mean rash in that they hastily entered into a union.

408
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:25,587
We know all this.

409
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:29,503
But if you think he married her to get something, I know that's not true.

410
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:32,165
He's basically a hermit, and happy to be one.

411
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:35,016
I could show you his place upstairs. I mean, you half expect Hari Krishnas

412
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:37,194
to jump out of the bathroom banging tambourines.

413
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,654
All he likes is fishing and watching baseball,

414
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:43,542
and he's got a reel and he's got a TV, so he's all set.

415
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:46,424
So when he says he wants nothing, I know he means it,

416
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,352
because when I think of Luke Danes, I think nothing.

417
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,653
Mr. Blodgett, Steins one and two, there you go.

418
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,096
Your choice of character witness does nothing to allay our concerns.

419
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,566
Sorry.

420
00:19:57,744 --> 00:20:00,658
The bottom line, time. If we do not receive a response in this matter,

421
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:02,682
we're just going to have to kick this up a notch.

422
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:04,525
Okay, there is something I want, but I've been holding back.

423
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:06,023
- As we suspected. 
- Let's hear it.

424
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:07,822
Okay, you know Nicole and I went on a cruise, right?

425
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:08,974
- Oh boy. 
- Oh yeah.

426
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,258
The first night on the boat we, uh, went to see an act

427
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,073
that everyone was raving about. We go in, sit down, they close the door.

428
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:16,437
Turned out to be a guy playing musical drinking glasses.

429
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,987
You know, with the half-filled cups that give off different tones.

430
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:22,711
He played Mozart, and I swear I could hear Mozart banging on his coffin.

431
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:26,715
Out of politeness, we stayed, and there went an hour of our lives.

432
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,704
Next night, the sign in front of the theater said the entertainment for the night

433
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:31,702
was a guy singing the songs of Sinatra.

434
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:35,854
We verified with the guy at the door, the songs of Frank Sinatra, right?

435
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,376
Not Tina, not Frank Jr., not Bill Sinatra, but Ol' Blue Eyes.

436
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:41,389
"Yes," he says. "It's like Frank come to life."

437
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,215
We go in, sit down, they close the door.

438
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:48,274
Then they announce that the guy singing Sinatra is sick

439
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:50,605
and the glass-playing guy is filling in.

440
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:52,714
Out he comes, there's goes another hour.

441
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:56,308
Next night, we meet a nice couple while walking the Lido Deck.

442
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,170
Had some nice conversation, so we have dinner with them.

443
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:03,272
Everything's going great. Then they invite us to go somewhere afterwards

444
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:06,841
- guess where they took us? That's right, to see the glass guy.

445
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,765
Three nights in a row, three hours total.

446
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,312
That's what I want - I want those three hours back.

447
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:14,603
We'll have to confer on this.

448
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,514
Maybe do a productivity study.

449
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:19,354
Yeah, get Blobb, Fromm and Pinnuccio in there, too.

450
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,904
- We'll get back to you. 
- I have no doubt.

451
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:26,937
- I'm exhausted. 
- Sorry I barged in like that.

452
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:28,775
Trust me, the interruption was welcome.

453
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,775
So, did you check the clock? It's not yet four.

454
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,373
- Rory safe and sound? 
- Safe and sound.

455
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,308
- And the truck? 
- Well...

456
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:35,903
- You wrecked it. 
- It's not wrecked.

457
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:37,565
- I don't see it. 
- It's around the corner.

458
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:40,070
- You wrecked it. 
- No, but I need to use it awhile longer.

459
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:41,698
Because you wrecked it and it's in the shop.

460
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:44,540
You really can't afford to alienate your chief character witness.

461
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:47,100
- It's full of stuff. 
- I know.

462
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:49,343
- Why didn't you unload it? 
- I did, this is my second load.

463
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,806
You didn't say anything about a second load.

464
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,787
I didn't know I had to have one 'til I realized

465
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,098
what a piker of a mother I'd been compared to the other kids' moms.

466
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:56,074
It's still running.

467
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:58,993
Yeah, well, turns out that ignition key

468
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,890
is just as misogynistic as that stick shift of yours.

469
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:06,803
- You just have to jiggle it a little. 
- You didn't mention any jiggling.

470
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:08,335
- It's common sense. 
- Oh, that.

471
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:10,135
Wait, why is the mattress still there?

472
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,771
Oh, that's not the mattress, that's a mattress.

473
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,467
- What? 
- Rory has the new mattress.

474
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:17,655
That's the Yale-supplied mattress that has microbes in it

475
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,115
that date back to Henry Box Brown.

476
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,094
What are you gonna do with it?

477
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:22,377
I was thinking maybe you could store it for me.

478
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,123
- No. 
- Come on.

479
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,458
I can't take it back to Yale.

480
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,250
I'm not storing your microbe mattress, forget it.

481
00:22:28,408 --> 00:22:30,005
Then I'm stuck here.

482
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:31,204
Fine, because I need my truck back.

483
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:33,650
- Fine, but that leaves you with the mattress. 
- I'm not taking the mattress.

484
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:35,879
- Then let me take the truck. 
- But that means you take the mattress.

485
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:37,609
- I can't take the mattress. 
- Then you can't have the truck.

486
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:39,088
But that sticks you with the mattress.

487
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:42,837
If you take the truck, it comes with the mattress.

488
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:44,829
- I can't take the mattress. 
- Then you can't have the truck.

489
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:46,271
And that sticks you with the mattress.

490
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:48,689
- We've been here before. 
- I recognize that tree.

491
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,015
Come on in.

492
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:57,588
- Another suitemate has arrived. 
- Oh yeah?

493
00:22:57,772 --> 00:22:59,169
Yeah. She's a little weird.

494
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,440
I've already forgotten her name. I'm a disaster with names.

495
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,127
That's okay.

496
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:06,767
It's the name of a city, like Athens or Rome or something.

497
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,854
I'm sure things can be rearranged. I mean, why not?

498
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:11,878
- It's a dorm, you're supposed to. 
- Let it go.

499
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:13,209
- Paris? 
- Yeah, that's it.

500
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:15,487
- How shocked are you? 
- Do you have a resuscitator?

501
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,927
- I'm going to Yale. 
- You're going to Yale.

502
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:18,703
- And we're suitemates. 
- Of all the gin joints.

503
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:20,122
Give me a hug! Wait.

504
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:21,647
Give me a hug!

505
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:24,730
This is a massively big surprise.

506
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:28,231
I was gonna call and then I thought, hey, let's wait and just be right in her face.

507
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:30,419
- I can't even feel my face anymore. 
- This is a good thing.

508
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:32,148
No, yes, it's definitely a good thing.

509
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:35,026
It's just, again, my nose... it feels like clay.

510
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,465
Oh, this is Terrence.

511
00:23:37,223 --> 00:23:37,775
Hello.

512
00:23:38,072 --> 00:23:39,725
It's nice to finally meet you, Rory.

513
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:42,111
- Terrence is my life coach. 
- Your what?

514
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:43,361
- Don't judge. 
- I'm not.

515
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:46,509
Remember my nanny? I lost her over the summer.

516
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:47,739
I'm sorry, what happened?

517
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:49,577
She opened a pupuseria in Boise.

518
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,684
- So she's okay? 
- Yeah, but I was pretty lost.

519
00:23:52,874 --> 00:23:55,894
Then my rabbi conferred with my therapist who said a hypnotist he knew

520
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:58,440
thought a life coach would be right for me, and that led me to Terrence.

521
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,333
He's here to assist me with whatever I need assistance in,

522
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:04,472
from wardrobe to diet to finding me a kick-ass gynecologist.

523
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,940
That's great, Paris, really.

524
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:07,723
He's done so much for my people skills.

525
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:10,210
I can cope with the little annoyances now.

526
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:14,137
For instance, the old Paris would've been bothered by your penchant to hover.

527
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:16,830
It would've made her wanna ring your neck until your eyeballs popped out.

528
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:22,049
But now, I accept it because I can't control everything. Paris Gellar.

529
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:23,927
That's Tanna.

530
00:24:24,035 --> 00:24:27,742
In medieval times, surnames often reflected a person's origin or occupation

531
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,501
so they were descriptive as well as utilitarian.

532
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,400
And what does Tanna mean?

533
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:34,583
Nothing.

534
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,113
We're gonna have some fun this year.

535
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:37,152
Thank you.

536
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:40,445
- How's your face? 
- Better, thanks.

537
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,118
- Is that my room? 
- If your initials are P.G., it is.

538
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:48,032
- Terrence, I got my southern exposure. 
- I'm a happy camper.

539
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:51,682
So, weird, weird coincidence that we're roommates like this, huh?

540
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:55,662
Not really. I told Terrence all about our history and he felt very strongly

541
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,842
that our life journey was not complete, so my dad made a call.

542
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:12,747
Luke, this was so nice of you, giving me a hand like this.

543
00:25:13,238 --> 00:25:14,989
It was above and beyond the call of duty.

544
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:16,377
Don't start this again.

545
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,025
- I'm not starting anything. 
- Good.

546
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,746
- I mean, if you just had stored the mattress... 
- That's where we're not starting.

547
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:24,662
What? It was your choice to come along.

548
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:28,011
I wanted the safe return of my truck without the mattress guaranteed.

549
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:30,905
- This was the only way. 
- You know, I miss our friendship.

550
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:34,307
We used to be so close. The summers at the lake...

551
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:36,216
Let's just move along here, okay?

552
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:37,768
- Hi, there. 
- Hello.

553
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:39,346
Is that your mattress?

554
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:40,867
Well, yeah.

555
00:25:41,347 --> 00:25:42,965
Tag has a Yale stamp.

556
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:46,134
Oh, well, when I said it was mine, it's not mine. It belongs in the dorm.

557
00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:48,383
We were just driving it around New Haven for awhile.

558
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:51,219
- To air it out. 
- Oh, okay.

559
00:25:51,378 --> 00:25:53,590
- We're gonna take it right back in. 
- Great.

560
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,649
- Thanks for jumping in. 
- You seemed to have a handle on it.

561
00:25:58,044 --> 00:25:59,278
- What do we do now? 
- Unload.

562
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:03,578
With the mattress. What do we do with the mattress?

563
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,655
- Saw you coming. 
- What's up?

564
00:26:13,983 --> 00:26:15,207
You just have to see it.

565
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,962
- No. 
- Yes.

566
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:21,160
Paris?

567
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:23,338
And Terrence, her life coach.

568
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:24,453
Like on Oprah?

569
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:25,605
- Yes. 
- No.

570
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,817
Yes. They're setting up her crafts' corner.

571
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:29,845
- No. 
- Yes.

572
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:32,221
- Lorelai! 
- Hi, Paris. It's so good to see you.

573
00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:33,623
Same here.

574
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:36,295
- Terrence, this is Lorelai. 
- Hi, Terrence.

575
00:26:36,414 --> 00:26:38,216
- Nice to meet you finally. 
- Finally?

576
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,362
You and I have a bit of a journey left to finish as well.

577
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:42,916
- I'll clear my schedule. 
- I was just setting up my craft corner.

578
00:26:43,014 --> 00:26:46,832
Some mosaic tiles, some colored beads. Still kind of kids' stuff,

579
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:50,334
but Terrence showed me how working with my hands could help with my nerves.

580
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:52,885
- Oh, where are we gonna put the couch? 
- Why don't you just...

581
00:26:52,962 --> 00:26:54,222
- Paris... 
- Come on, Terrence.

582
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:56,232
Two steps forward, three steps back.

583
00:26:56,372 --> 00:26:57,426
But she was baiting me.

584
00:26:57,514 --> 00:26:59,110
Fish can choose not to bite.

585
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:03,493
We'll figure it out.

586
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,217
- This the place? 
- This is the place.

587
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,184
Oh, hold it a minute! You can't bring that thing in here.

588
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,639
I'm not taking it back out. Hi, Rory.

589
00:27:12,843 --> 00:27:13,411
Hi, Luke.

590
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:15,720
No, we're unloading bags and boxes first.

591
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:18,436
Look, that Tess already had her antennae up about the mattress

592
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,768
and she wouldn't stop watching me, so I had to do something.

593
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:22,852
Wait until she's gone and then bring it back out.

594
00:27:22,944 --> 00:27:25,898
It's heavy. The only way I got it into the building is with help from Chip

595
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,884
- his real name, believe it or not. Now I have to go help him

596
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:30,738
unload his stuff because that was the deal.

597
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:32,995
No, you don't. Blow him off.

598
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:37,752
He's probably busy taping his Carmen Electra poster up on the ceiling above his bed.

599
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:40,977
The mattress stays. Now if you'll excuse me, Chip is waiting.

600
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:43,717
Oh no! My glue gun leaked on my macaroni!

601
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,444
Compartmentalize... and breathe.

602
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:50,803
Let's get this thing out of the hallway.

603
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:54,331
I got a crisp Benjamin Franklin for anyone willing

604
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:56,281
to disappear a mattress, no questions asked.

605
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:57,669
Start pushing.

606
00:27:57,966 --> 00:27:58,550
Anyone?

607
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:02,487
Two Benjamins?

608
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:04,279
Hold on.

609
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,296
Anything else you need, you'll write it down, okay?

610
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:09,297
I've got more than I need. Stuff I don't need.

611
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:11,489
- It's all necessary stuff. 
- The disco ball?

612
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,849
You cannot host your much-anticipated Salute to Barry White Night without a disco ball.

613
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:18,456
I forgot I was anticipating that. Where's Luke?

614
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,619
He's already out at the truck.

615
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:23,208
So, this is it.

616
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,518
This is really it.

617
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:26,474
Learn a lot of stuff.

618
00:28:26,945 --> 00:28:27,764
I'll try.

619
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:29,654
You'll be a frequent visitor?

620
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:31,599
I'll be a frequent visitor.

621
00:28:31,886 --> 00:28:33,437
You can use the washer and the dryer.

622
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:35,368
- I don't need any inducement. 
- Good.

623
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:37,514
But don't you get rid of that washer and dryer.

624
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:39,125
I won't.

625
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:42,664
Ciao, baby.

626
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:44,651
Bye, Mom.

627
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,794
So Chip is like, "Set your side down first" and I'm like,

628
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,781
"My side's the side with the leg missing. It's gonna collapse.

629
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:34,069
You put your side down first" and he's like, "I'm losing my grip",

630
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:38,221
which was his excuse with everything we carried in - the TV, the stereo speakers.

631
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:41,221
- And I was like... 
- Oh my God, will you, like, get over this?

632
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:42,713
What's that?

633
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:43,778
It's my pager.

634
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:48,242
- Oh no. 
- What?

635
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:49,261
"Come back."

636
00:29:50,465 --> 00:29:51,745
- What? 
- It's from Rory.

637
00:29:51,862 --> 00:29:54,458
It says "Come back" with about a dozen exclamation points.

638
00:29:55,748 --> 00:29:57,848
- Move, move. 
- What are you doing?

639
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,644
- I gotta borrow your truck. 
- No way.

640
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,278
- I gotta go back. 
- Then take your own car.

641
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:04,048
- Remember that concept? 
- No, it'll take too long to walk back to get it.

642
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,855
Plus, I'm out of gas. Plus, it's been making weird noises

643
00:30:05,927 --> 00:30:07,770
and probably can't take a long trip. Please, Luke?

644
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,722
- I need my truck. 
- I need it more.

645
00:30:09,828 --> 00:30:11,037
You've had it all day.

646
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:14,108
- Don't you care about Rory? 
- Of course I care about Rory.

647
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:19,910
- Have it back by seven. 
- Thanks, Luke.

648
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,466
- That's reverse. 
- I know.

649
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:34,676
Rory?

650
00:30:35,342 --> 00:30:37,266
Oh, whoa, honey.

651
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,462
- Look at this, look at this. 
- Look at what?

652
00:30:40,912 --> 00:30:43,089
Four hours at Yale and I'm already homesick.

653
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:44,840
Well, that's okay.

654
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:47,516
All I could think of the minute you left was "I want my mommy."

655
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:49,446
I haven't thought that since I was two.

656
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:51,392
- That's natural. 
- I'm eighteen.

657
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:54,526
I can sign contracts, I can vote, I can fight for my country.

658
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:57,337
I mean, I'm an adult. Adults don't want their mommies.

659
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,107
Yes, they do, honey. I'm not a good example, but...

660
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:02,441
Everything's so foreign. I have to share a bathroom.

661
00:31:02,575 --> 00:31:04,382
I've never shared a bathroom with anyone but you.

662
00:31:04,536 --> 00:31:07,594
So I'm gonna be running into people in the bathroom, we're gonna have to make small talk.

663
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:10,864
- I don't know any bathroom small talk. 
- Gee, your hair smells terrific?

664
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,885
You didn't socialize me properly. You made me a mama's girl.

665
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:16,183
Why don't I hate you? Why don't I want to be away from you?

666
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:19,713
It's going to be very hard to be Christiane Amanpour broadcasting

667
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,662
live from a foxhole in Tehran with my mommy.

668
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:23,385
I guess you're just gonna have to learn how to operate a camera

669
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:25,381
- 'cause I'll need you there with me. 
- I would do that.

670
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,711
And how did I end up at Yale?

671
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:31,303
I mean, I let Grandma and Grandpa manipulate me right out of Harvard

672
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:34,682
and into Yale. That's how strong-willed I am. I know nothing about Yale.

673
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:36,751
Not so - you've memorized its entire history.

674
00:31:36,823 --> 00:31:39,885
How can you be so fine with this? You left here without a care in the world.

675
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,270
- That's not true. 
- You couldn't wait for me to get out of the house.

676
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:45,333
What were you doing when I paged you - turning my room into a sewing room?

677
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:48,303
I should hate you, not miss you. Do something to make me hate you.

678
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:50,151
Go Hitler!

679
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,667
- Check this out. 
- Your student ID?

680
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:55,731
I'm blinking and my head's in a funny place.

681
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:58,680
- No, it's not. 
- I look like Keith Richards at Altamont.

682
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:02,045
- And check out the name. 
- Ronny Gilmore. Oops.

683
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:04,983
Yeah, oops. I don't even exist. And how did they get Ronny?

684
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,718
That's not even remotely close to being short for any girl's name

685
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:11,941
- in the history of the entire planet. 
- Veronica, actually... sorry.

686
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:15,505
Great, now I have you apologizing to me after I made you come back all this way

687
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,840
just 'cause I'm a big fat stinkin' mama's girl.

688
00:32:18,013 --> 00:32:19,381
- Mom! 
- I'm here.

689
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:22,816
- But you're not supposed to be. 
- Where is it written?

690
00:32:23,073 --> 00:32:25,715
Well, it's not exactly written, but it's clearly implied

691
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:28,316
that the parents are supposed to leave the campus at some point.

692
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:31,009
Yeah, at some point. So we choose the point.

693
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:33,579
- So can you stay for dinner? 
- I can stay all night.

694
00:32:33,713 --> 00:32:35,752
- No, you can't do that. 
- Why not?

695
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:38,950
Because then I'm the pathetic person who needs her mother to stay all night

696
00:32:39,053 --> 00:32:40,772
and everyone here will see and know that.

697
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:43,138
- Okay, so I won't spend the night. 
- No, stay the night.

698
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:52,001
I've got Balinese.

699
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:53,594
Where does Bali go?

700
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:57,049
We're still putting everything in geographic order. East to west.

701
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:59,516
- That's the system. Where is Bali? 
- Indonesia.

702
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:01,569
Is Indonesia east or west of the Philippines?

703
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,213
- East. 
- No, west.

704
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,176
Near Singapore? We've got Singapore here somewhere.

705
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:06,879
Find Sri Lanka, it's a bit over from that.

706
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:09,041
- But there's no Sri Lankan food. 
- Just put it by Vietnam.

707
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:11,113
Is Vietnam east or west of the Philippines?

708
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,131
Boy, you guys really need to go to college.

709
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,051
- We ordered too much food. 
- Hello, the point.

710
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,712
We need a wide cross section for our local takeout test.

711
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,745
I still smell glue from your glue gun.

712
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:22,461
- You're rich, you know that? 
- What is this?

713
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:26,053
You've eaten Indian food, yet I see nothing about Indian food on the chart.

714
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:26,777
We'll get to it.

715
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:28,574
The whole point of getting everything within delivery distance

716
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:31,205
is so we can judge the quality of food, speed of service,

717
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,494
Cuteness of delivery guys on a scale of one to ten.

718
00:33:33,735 --> 00:33:35,127
We cannot work from memory on this.

719
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:37,528
- Where's the phone? 
- Under Mexico.

720
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:38,722
I bet it's the pizza. Come help.

721
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:45,792
- Hello, eight and a half. 
- I'm sorry?

722
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,978
Nothing. We just need to sign for the credit card?

723
00:33:48,246 --> 00:33:48,731
Yes.

724
00:33:49,914 --> 00:33:51,000
Thank you.

725
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:53,989
We're four people and we ordered for like four hundred.

726
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:57,615
So, what you're saying is you wanna crank it up? You wanna set it off?

727
00:33:57,717 --> 00:33:59,677
You wanna put a match to the keg and burn this mofo down?

728
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:00,969
I'm just saying it's a lot of food.

729
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,472
- Attention, Durfee girls! 
- Mom!

730
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:08,392
Food and tons of it in suite five. Bring your appetites, bring your opinions,

731
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:11,229
and, someone bring some music, but if it's Evanescence,

732
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:12,714
you will be severely mocked.

733
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:14,665
Enter, rejoice and come in.

734
00:34:19,365 --> 00:34:20,610
Oh, hey, ice cream man.

735
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:24,203
- Here you go. 
- Thanks. Have a nice night.

736
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:26,522
You, too. do me a favor?

737
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:28,243
Count to ten before you leave.

738
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:29,881
- Sure. 
- Thanks.

739
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:34,054
Hey, rate him, rate him!

740
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:39,260
Hey, where does ice cream stand on our organizational system?

741
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:41,658
Our organizational system broke down about an hour ago.

742
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:44,028
- Germany fell on China. 
- Well, that's Germany for ya.

743
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:48,061
Okay, we're out of Chinese completely, so we know Chinese is popular.

744
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:51,309
Freddy's Happy Tokyo Takeout is a bust. That's the consensus,

745
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:54,693
so let's lose the Freddy's menus, although Ang the delivery guy was a solid nine.

746
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:57,621
If you're gonna go to Baja Bill's, you must get the cheese quesadilla,

747
00:34:57,714 --> 00:35:01,457
and ask for Stan or Tommy. If you don't get Stan or Tommy, go to Paco's Tacos.

748
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:04,247
The delivery guys are butt ugly but the food is better.

749
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:09,152
Look at all these girls together in one room having fun.

750
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:12,105
We should dance and sing a Motown song into our hairbrushes.

751
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:16,258
So, do you like your adoptive parents?

752
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,202
I think it's good to be adopted.

753
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:22,321
If you get sick of them, you just dump this set and go find the originals.

754
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:25,578
- This is awesome. 
- Thanks.

755
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,385
Who did all this?

756
00:35:26,826 --> 00:35:29,310
- The woman with the hairbrush. 
- You guys, come on.

757
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:30,881
I know it's cheesy but just a couple bars...

758
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:32,545
You Can't Hurry Love?

759
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:35,740
Someone's gotta do it, it doesn't have to be on key.

760
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:39,846
It's lacking in storage space, but I've accepted it.

761
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:42,621
It's a bit musty, but I've accepted it.

762
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:44,136
Small.

763
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:46,604
Small, but I've accepted it.

764
00:35:47,496 --> 00:35:48,756
Hey, listen, I should be going.

765
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:51,853
Jamie, Terrence is not here, he's back in his room.

766
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,401
Oh, right, me and Terrence, that's a possibility.

767
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:59,508
I really gotta go, okay? I will. Good night.

768
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:01,357
Has he met Terrence?

769
00:36:01,976 --> 00:36:04,270
Nope, and he's not going to for as long as I can help it.

770
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:07,356
- I fixed your shower head. 
- Really? But it was barely dribbling out.

771
00:36:07,474 --> 00:36:09,661
It just needed a twist. You've got a waterfall now.

772
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:11,540
- You're so handy. 
- And my rates are reasonable.

773
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:12,780
- My turn? 
- It's all yours.

774
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:15,774
No, Mom, you sleep on the new mattress.

775
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:18,600
- But it's yours. 
- They're both mine, so I get to choose.

776
00:36:18,754 --> 00:36:21,390
- I'll sleep on the Yale mattress. 
- But you have to break in your new mattress.

777
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:26,014
If it molds to my body, your shorter body will be wallowing in the hollowness of my body.

778
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,058
In one night?

779
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,902
It's the crucial night, that first night.

780
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:31,262
Okay, but my offer still stands,

781
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:34,600
so if you get the heebie-jeebies in the middle of the night over there, come join me.

782
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:41,102
That'll get the girls talking. We'll be those dirty, filthy, almost-French Stars Hollow girls.

783
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:46,669
Oh, we spit on you, you repressed puritanical ninnies.

784
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,676
We smirk in your general direction.

785
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:53,243
We cast sidelong glances that are vague but slightly threatening.

786
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,869
We eschew your quaint double entendre

787
00:36:55,962 --> 00:36:59,464
for the appealing lasciviousness of the entendre singular.

788
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:01,901
We... I'm out.

789
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:02,934
Me, too. Get the light.

790
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,894
- Did I tell you I found good coffee? 
- No, where?

791
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:15,321
The little kiosk by the library. I found it on the way to that parents thing.

792
00:37:15,412 --> 00:37:15,949
Cool.

793
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:17,568
- I'll circle it on the map for you. 
- Good.

794
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:23,830
Is that some guy howling?

795
00:37:24,257 --> 00:37:26,027
I don't know, sounded like it.

796
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,657
- Sounds like the guys' floor had some fun tonight, too. 
- I'd say so.

797
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:38,063
- Mom! 
- Well, if no one answers him, he may never stop.

798
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:42,543
Or it'll get a bunch of other guys howling, one or the other.

799
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:47,500
- Oh, boy. 
- It's fun.

800
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:55,599
It is fun.

801
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:02,655
- What? 
- I don't know.

802
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,452
So, what's first on the agenda today?

803
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,653
I have a little time, so I thought I might walk around

804
00:38:10,718 --> 00:38:13,227
and get the lay of the land a little bit, and then I have my big freshman assembly.

805
00:38:13,355 --> 00:38:15,311
Where they teach you the secret Yale handshake?

806
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:16,642
Amongst other things.

807
00:38:16,842 --> 00:38:19,418
Oh my God, check out Paris' craft corner.

808
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,050
She gets more done before nine than other people do all day.

809
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:25,327
She's a craft person now, so it's not safe to leave anything around her anymore.

810
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,748
- Maybe that's where crafty comes from. 
- Good point.

811
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,527
All right, I should go. I called Luke last night

812
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,892
and he made me promise to get the truck back by two hours ago,

813
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,865
so if I leave now it's sooner than I planned.

814
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,496
Thank Luke a lot for me, okay?

815
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:41,501
Okay, say goodbye to Paris and Tanna.

816
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:42,344
Will do.

817
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,581
- So, this is really it. 
- Yup.

818
00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:48,700
- You good? 
- I'm good.

819
00:38:48,864 --> 00:38:51,224
- Just keep your pager with you. 
- Always.

820
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:03,917
- You're late. 
- I'm sorry.

821
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:05,866
It's okay. I told you to get it back three hours

822
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:08,407
before I actually needed it back and it worked out perfectly.

823
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:09,988
- You rat. 
- So it's in park?

824
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:11,852
- It's in park. 
- Engine's off?

825
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,545
Yes. Here are your keys.

826
00:39:14,806 --> 00:39:18,034
And thank you, Luke. I've been a huge burden on you the past couple days.

827
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:18,883
It's okay.

828
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:21,284
I don't believe it.

829
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,398
- It's like a horror movie. 
- Oh, Luke.

830
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:28,200
The mattress that would not leave my truck.

831
00:39:28,374 --> 00:39:29,793
- I had no choice. 
- I may cry.

832
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:31,606
- Don't do that. 
- I don't want this mattress.

833
00:39:31,846 --> 00:39:33,156
- Help me take it somewhere. 
- Where?

834
00:39:33,316 --> 00:39:36,807
To the conveniently located old mattress drop-off station right around the corner?

835
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,885
- Or if you could store it for awhile... 
- I wasn't kidding about the crying.

836
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:42,956
I'll call a charity and have them come pick it up. I promise, and this time I mean it.

837
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:44,057
And where's my spare tire?

838
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:46,412
- There was a spare tire? 
- I had my spare tire back here.

839
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:49,474
Oh, we must've accidentally unloaded it on one of our trips.

840
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:50,816
Could you try to get it back?

841
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:54,220
Yes, as long as Paris hasn't made it into a planter yet.

842
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:56,960
- Or I'll buy you a new one, I promise. 
- Okay, I'll see you later.

843
00:39:57,113 --> 00:40:00,898
Okay, bye. Oh, and Rory says thanks for everything, too.

844
00:40:01,062 --> 00:40:04,148
- She said specifically to tell you. 
- Okay, good. So she's okay?

845
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:06,826
- She's fantastic. 
- Good.

846
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:16,365
- You're up? 
- I was up. Come on in.

847
00:40:16,902 --> 00:40:19,257
We Lorelai'd a few places and found the good coffee.

848
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:21,341
- Lorelai'd? 
- Checked places out.

849
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,157
Seems like the appropriate word. We found decent muffins, too,

850
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:26,421
- but I bet there's better out there. 
- You'll Lorelai 'em another time.

851
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:29,979
So this is thanks for last night. It was a perfect first night at Yale.

852
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:30,833
I thought so.

853
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,287
We're gonna go to freshman assembly together.

854
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,210
- Do you wanna come? 
- Sure.

855
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:37,135
Then we're all going to conveniently lose our student ID's and go take new pictures.

856
00:40:37,244 --> 00:40:39,277
- Oh my God, I'm so with you on that one. 
- Cool.

857
00:40:40,711 --> 00:40:43,593
Whoa, this is really good. Kiosk by the library?

858
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:46,696
- Oh, you found it first. 
- Kind of.
