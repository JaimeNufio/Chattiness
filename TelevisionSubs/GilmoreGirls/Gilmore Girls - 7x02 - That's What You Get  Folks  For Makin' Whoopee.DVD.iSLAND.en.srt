1
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:10,747
Morning, Rory.

2
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,539
Please tell me you haven't
been standing there all night.

3
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:13,660
I love you Rory.

4
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,762
Creepy.

5
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:17,076
- Ooh, waffles?
- Yes, I got up early this morning

6
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:18,801
and I thought,
"what better way to pass time

7
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:22,581
than make some of my
famous homemade waffles?"

8
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:24,326
I can't believe I forgot
about your homemade waffles,

9
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,478
seeing how famous they are.

10
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:26,926
Infamous, really.

11
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,161
So why'd you get up so early?

12
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:29,619
Mm, well, couldn't sleep.

13
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:31,681
And, initially,
I was at a loss.

14
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,702
I mean, how would I pass the time
until my one and only offspring,

15
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:37,012
- the fruit of my loins --
- Too early.

16
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:38,767
...loin fruit that she is,

17
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,385
straggled out of bed to
grace me with her presence?

18
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:45,644
But then I asked
myself, "W.W.T.B.F.C.D.?"

19
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:47,409
And it came to me in a flash.

20
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:48,549
"I'm gonna make waffles."

21
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,883
"What would the
barefoot contessa do?"

22
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:50,883
Exactly.

23
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:51,888
Barefoot's one word.

24
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:53,107
Shut up, loin fruit.

25
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:54,995
So, what? Are you just sleepy

26
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,889
or has last night's "my boyfriend gave
me a love rocket" elation worn off?

27
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:00,779
It may have worn
off a little bit.

28
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,110
Why? What happened?

29
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:04,788
The love rocket was making you
swoon for Logan last night.

30
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,091
I'm still plenty swoony.

31
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:08,833
I just realized that
the rocket doesn't mean

32
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,771
I should be packing
my bags for London.

33
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:12,078
Why? What happened?

34
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:14,302
Nothing happend.
I just called Logan, and I was like,

35
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,563
"yeah, yeah.
Oh, I love the love rocket, you know?

36
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:17,650
And I can't wait
to come see you."

37
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:19,718
And he was like,
"oh, yeah, me too.

38
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,924
Um, I'm gonna buy you
a ticket for december."

39
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,677
Oh, no. Did you tell him
you want to visit him now?

40
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:27,181
There wasn't really a point,
you know, because I get it.

41
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:29,270
He is starting his
first real job.

42
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:32,829
I mean,
he needs time to adjust and focus

43
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,229
and learn the lay of the land.

44
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,406
I mean, it's good that he's trying
to be a grown-up, you know.

45
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,747
So now I'm trying
to be a grown-up.

46
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:42,124
So why am I gonna get all pouty
because I don't get to do it?

47
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,196
Hmm.

48
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,709
Well, that sounds like
a real grown-up talking.

49
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:46,458
Thank you.

50
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:48,675
You know the one thing that
grown-ups don't call themselves?

51
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:49,526
What?

52
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,762
Grown-ups.

53
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:53,985
They say "adults," And they
pronounce it "ah-dults."

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,192
- It stinks!
- Oh, it really stinks.

55
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:57,208
Stupid London!

56
00:03:57,222 --> 00:03:59,952
If he weren't in London right now,
we would be on our Asia trip.

57
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:02,847
I mean, I knew that it might not happen,
but I hoped it would,

58
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:06,166
and I just kept planning
and planning and planning.

59
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:12,045
Wow. Were you planning on
visiting Asia or invading it?

60
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:13,436
Look at all this wasted effort.

61
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,037
All this highlighter
ink? Wasted.

62
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:16,907
All of these sticky
notes? Wasted.

63
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,582
We were going to see the
terra-cotta soldiers in Xian.

64
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,326
And we were going to go to Peking
for the opera and the duck.

65
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:26,153
I want to see Tibet. I want to snorkel
off the an thoi islands in Vietnam.

66
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:30,181
I want to see the crazy teenage fashions
in the harajuku district of Tokyo.

67
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:31,656
Oh, wow.

68
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,008
Stupid London!

69
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,351
-  So, no Asia?
- No Asia.

70
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:37,813
Well, I guess I got
to go to stupid work.

71
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,913
Here's one good piece
of news, though.

72
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,430
Lane called.
She's back from her honeymoon.

73
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,908
- Oh, yay!
- Yeah.

74
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:45,286
She sounded kind of tired,
which is good, I think.

75
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,270
Tired after a
honeymoon bodes well.

76
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:49,640
My married friend Lane and
her married husband Zach.

77
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:50,684
Nutso.

78
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,796
Hmm. Spoken like
a true grown-up.

79
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:54,522
Say "hey" to her for me.

80
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:55,671
It's nice to have you home.

81
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,160
Bye.

82
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:11,630
Morning, Luke.

83
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:13,825
- You need a hand with this?
- Thanks.

84
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,024
Sure thing.

85
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,306
Just give me one second
to savor this coffee.

86
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:22,143
So, how are you this
lovely morning?

87
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:23,492
Just fine.

88
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:25,988
- Hey, I got a coffee for you, too.
- Thanks.

89
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,787
But then, as it became clear that
you were most likely gonna be late,

90
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:31,605
I didn't want it to get cold,
so I drank it myself.

91
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,844
I wasn't late.

92
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:33,859
Who said you were late?

93
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,109
You did, one second ago.

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,574
Oh, no, I said you were
mostly likely gonna be late,

95
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,787
but it turns out you weren't.
Who knew?

96
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:41,898
Sounds like you need a little caffeine,
my friend.

97
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:44,208
What say you and I go over to
the diner across the street

98
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:46,289
and pick us up a
nice cup of coffee?

99
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,842
Forget it. I'm fine.

100
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,405
What diner across the street?

101
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,488
This place --
Kirk's. Great place.

102
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:53,846
The owner's a real character.
And the coffee's fantastic.

103
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:55,162
Come on, let me get you a cup,

104
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:59,027
though maybe you ought to pay, seeing
as I did pick us up the last round.

105
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:02,720
Eggs sunny side up
with a side of bacon.

106
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:05,920
And who's got the
scrambled with hashbrowns?

107
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:07,272
Here we go.

108
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:09,048
What the hell is going on here?

109
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:10,765
Welcome to Kirk's.
I'll be right with you.

110
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:11,878
What is this?

111
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:12,941
It's a diner, Luke.

112
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,187
A diner called Kirk's?

113
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,779
It's the name my
mother gave me.

114
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,152
Top you off there, Jake?

115
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,484
Why  are you doing this?

116
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:20,286
I just saw a need,
and I filled it.

117
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,404
Seemed  to me Stars Hollow was in
want of a real neighborhood joint,

118
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,640
a watering hole where the
townsfolk could mingle,

119
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:29,551
a place where a fella could come and
get a piece of pie, a cup of arbuckles',

120
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,526
and a soupcon of
small-town charm.

121
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:33,735
Yeah, well,
Stars Hollow has already got that place.

122
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:35,183
It's right across the street.

123
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:37,109
It's called Luke's.
Luke's. Ring any bells?

124
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:38,596
Sounds a little like Kirk's,
doesn't it?

125
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:40,723
Luke, if you are suggesting that
you were the very first person

126
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,073
to ever think of naming a
restaurant after yourself,

127
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,816
I think that Denny Arby,
and Tony Roma

128
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,256
might have something
to say about that,

129
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:49,454
not to mention Mr.
Chuck E. Cheese.

130
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:51,206
Chuck E. Cheese... Chuck E.
Cheese is not a person.

131
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:54,583
Luke, do you think a giant mouse opened
a national restaurant franchise by himself?

132
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:57,745
Look at this -- french toast,
pancakes, buttermilk pancakes.

133
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:59,121
You stole my menu.

134
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,240
You did not invent
pancakes, Luke.

135
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,801
Anyway, I heard Luke's
went out of business.

136
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:05,169
Luke's did not go out of business.
Luke's is closed for repairs.

137
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:06,333
And you want to know
why it's closed?

138
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:10,351
Because some nincompoop yesterday
drove his car through my diner!

139
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:13,111
Would you care to step
outside for a moment, Luke?

140
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:15,233
Outside? Outside what?

141
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:21,926
I think it would behoove you
not to use slanderous language

142
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:24,398
like nincompoop in my
place of business, Luke,

143
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,421
because, let me tell you, it is only
out of the kindness of my heart

144
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:29,867
that I am not suing
the pants off of you.

145
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:33,491
You're gonna sue me after
you crash a car into my diner

146
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:35,668
and bust a giant
hole in my wall?

147
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:37,212
For all you know,
I could have brain damage.

148
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:38,691
Oh, I'm pretty sure you do.

149
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,867
You know what, Kirk?
Go ahead. Sue me.

150
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,398
Crash into my diner,
make me lose a week's business,

151
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:46,199
make me pay for the repairs,
and then sue me for damages --

152
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:48,146
for brain damages!
That sounds fair.

153
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:50,649
Luke, calm down.
I get where you're coming from.

154
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:52,489
I think we can work
something out.

155
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,555
What is this?

156
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:57,917
A job application.

157
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:01,111
The way business is picking up,
I'm totally gonna need a fry guy.

158
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:03,779
What, it sounded like your
finances were kind of tight.

159
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:06,129
If you came expecting a handout,
you came to the wrong guy.

160
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,602
I'm of the "teach a man
to fish" school, Luke.

161
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:15,641
You do not throw trash on the
floor of a restaurant, Luke.

162
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,976
Not cool.

163
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:21,012
Okay, this is easy.
You put in your snow crab.

164
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:24,550
You put in your avocado.
You put in your cucumber.

165
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:26,574
You match it together.

166
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,153
And then you just roll it up.

167
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:33,058
Slice it up like this,
and voilà.

168
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:34,868
Or whatever they say in Japan.

169
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:36,751
- Arigato.
- Karate.

170
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:40,201
Look, it's those little coin shapes,
just like in a japanese restaurant.

171
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:41,813
Arigato karate, babe.

172
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:43,588
Yep. Okay.

173
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,437
I'm gonna make one
more California roll,

174
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:47,547
and then we can make your
meat-loaf sushi as promised.

175
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,937
Yay! Do you want to put
suntan lotion in there?

176
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:53,186
Did you just say sun--
Oh! Of course.

177
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:57,466
Because a California roll would
have some suntan lotion in it.

178
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,478
You're such a pity laugher.
Mmm! Good!

179
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:01,293
- Good?
- So good!

180
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:04,312
It's the best non-meat-loaf
sushi I've ever had.

181
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:06,441
Ooh! What about
fried-chicken sushi?

182
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:08,475
With some slaw in it.
That would be so good.

183
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:12,158
Or chinese-food sushi.
Or P.B.-and-J. sushi.

184
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:13,520
Or, hey, dessert sushi.

185
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:16,060
Oh, my god, that's genius.
That is why you are the chef.

186
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:18,103
That and because you're
the one who can cook.

187
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,500
So, um...

188
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:22,821
Hey, um...

189
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:25,952
So I-I told him.

190
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:28,461
Told who what?

191
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,830
- Telling him that?
- Yeah.

192
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:33,102
Are you saying you told
Luke about Christopher?

193
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,943
Yes. What did you think
I was talking about?

194
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,231
I don't know.

195
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,571
I'm hoping there's
something that I forgot,

196
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,130
like maybe you were debating
on whether or not to tell Kirk

197
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,440
the difference between
antiperspirant and deodorant.

198
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:45,014
You told Luke
about Christopher?

199
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:45,752
Yes.

200
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,612
I thought no matter what
you weren't going to.

201
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,545
I wasn't.

202
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:49,884
Oh, honey, why?

203
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:52,764
Because Luke showed up
at my house this morning

204
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:55,640
with the truck fully packed,
ready to elope.

205
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:56,897
- Oh, god, he did?
- Yeah.

206
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,918
And he wouldn't take no for an answer,
and so I had to tell him.

207
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,511
That's the only way he
was gonna believe me

208
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:04,521
because it had to be no.

209
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:05,893
Did it have to be?

210
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:08,500
I mean,
did the answer have to be no?

211
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:11,695
No. I mean,
I guess I could be married right now

212
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,534
to someone who doesn't
want to be married to me

213
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:17,170
and who doesn't know that I slept with
someone two nights before we got married.

214
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:20,058
Well, when you
put it that way...

215
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:22,830
Must have been horrible.

216
00:10:23,226 --> 00:10:26,916
It was one of the most horrible
moments of my whole life.

217
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,344
Are you okay?

218
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:29,839
No.

219
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:34,318
I mean, no, not at all.
I'm so very not fine,

220
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,897
but what am I gonna do,
you know?

221
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:38,874
I have to be fine.

222
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,736
Oh, honey.

223
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,595
Yeah.

224
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,005
Hey, Zach.
So, the honeymoon's over.

225
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:51,159
Is  the honeymoon over?

226
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:51,773
What?

227
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:52,789
How was Mexico?

228
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:53,986
Full of parasites.

229
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,599
Oh, gee, that's no good.

230
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,556
The whole trip was
a total fiasco.

231
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,982
It was the Stones at
Altamont times a billion.

232
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:01,918
But you and Lane were
so excited about it.

233
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,884
From the way you talked,
I was worried you'd move there

234
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,026
and start a mariachi band.

235
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,383
Mexico sucks.
And we were psyched.

236
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,746
That's part of why
it sucked so bad.

237
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:10,876
I thought I found this
amazing deal online, right?

238
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:13,160
Pedro's Paradise.
It all sounded good.

239
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,293
The website said it had ocean views,
its own kitchen, and a jacuzzi.

240
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:19,920
And nobody loves jacuzzis
more than me. Nobody.

241
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,970
And then we get there,
and it turns out Pedro's Paradise

242
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,028
is just this room in this dude
Pedro's crappy apartment.

243
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:27,187
No. His apartment?

244
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:31,820
23 miles from the ocean, with a view of
a billboard for mexican nasal spray.

245
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,250
So the website lied.

246
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,857
And the kitchen we were promised --
it smelled like rice-a-roni

247
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:37,814
and was always full of
Pedro's jerky friends

248
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,733
listening to the devil's music,
playing cards,

249
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:42,362
and making snide remarks
about us in code.

250
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,761
Pedro's friends talked in code?

251
00:11:43,776 --> 00:11:46,168
Well, spanish, technically.
Same difference.

252
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:48,605
They knew I couldn't understand them.
Pedro was evil, man.

253
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,507
Man.

254
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:51,675
Anyway, on the second day,
I got some parasite,

255
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,369
and I've been barfing Linda
Blair style ever since.

256
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,239
I'm getting better,
but now it looks like Lane's got it.

257
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,035
Oh no!

258
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,395
I'm heading over to
Doose's right now

259
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,565
to get some ginger
ale and saltines,

260
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:02,921
which, by the way, was all we
ate in the way of mexican food.

261
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:04,640
Oh,  I'm sorry your
trip was so sucky.

262
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:06,538
Yeah, well, live and learn.

263
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,841
Like, now I know not to
drink the water in Mexico,

264
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,075
which, by the way,
somebody should really tell you.

265
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,202
And I learned that I'm not
morally against murder.

266
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:14,756
I just wish I had
the guts to do it.

267
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:17,846
Well, I'm glad you didn't kill Pedro.
I mean, he's not worth it.

268
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,408
Yeah, whatever.

269
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,178
Hello.

270
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,866
Hola, Rory.

271
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,686
Hey, sicko.

272
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:36,920
Oh, welcome home.

273
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:39,521
I heard Pedro's Paradise
wasn't so paradisey.

274
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:40,720
Mexico sucked.

275
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:43,470
Oh. But guess who I heard it from --
your husband.

276
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:44,909
Can we not squeal about that?

277
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:46,386
I don't really want to squeal.

278
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:48,006
But if you feel like squealing,
go ahead.

279
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:50,261
Oh, I'm sorry.
Of course you don't feel like squealing.

280
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:51,182
You're sick.

281
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:53,195
I actually feel okay right now.

282
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,178
My aversion to squealing is
more emotional than physical.

283
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm so sorry your honeymoon
was such a bummer.

284
00:12:58,013 --> 00:13:00,408
On, like, the fourth day,
Zach got so paranoid

285
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:04,542
that Pedro and his friends were
talking lasciviously about me in code

286
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:07,245
that he lunged at Pedro --
leapt at him from behind the door.

287
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,064
Luckily, Zach was so weak from
parasites that he missed --

288
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,743
just flopped to
the kitchen floor

289
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,025
Like he was a pancake someone
threw across the room.

290
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,504
People throw pancakes?

291
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:18,323
I just stared at him lying
on the floor and thought,

292
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:19,856
"I just married that man."

293
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:21,841
And you didn't squeal for joy.

294
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:22,656
Nope.

295
00:13:22,672 --> 00:13:23,703
I went into the other room

296
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:27,126
and stared at Pedro's poster
of Spuds McKenzie hanging 20

297
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,959
and ate my 20th
saltine of the day.

298
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,444
The whole trip sounds
kind of rough.

299
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,307
Oh, you have no idea.

300
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:35,548
What I just told you are the
highlights compared to the real stuff.

301
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:36,871
No. What?

302
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:38,607
We can't talk here.
The walls have ears.

303
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:39,575
And giant sombrero.

304
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,109
And big mouth.
Let's go for a walk.

305
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,913
No, you're not feeling right.
You should take care of yourself.

306
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:45,366
I'm feeling all right
right now, actually.

307
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:47,036
Besides, I have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow,

308
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,838
and if I start to
barf in public,

309
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:50,843
you could just pretend we
were partying too hard.

310
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:52,358
Which would do
wonders for my rep.

311
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,796
All right, Mrs. Van Gerbig,

312
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,698
let's blow this popsicle stand.

313
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,601
Okay. So tell me --

314
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:00,529
what are we thinking
about here?

315
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:03,281
Well, the basic idea is
to fix the giant hole.

316
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:05,057
Yeah, but how?
'Cause I've been thinking about it.

317
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:08,077
I got a couple ideas about
a sort of log-cabin thing.

318
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,637
I think what might really be nice
is a giant stained-glass window.

319
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,354
Yeah, I don't think so.

320
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,693
Don't rule it out so quick.

321
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:18,521
I can picture what you're picturing,
like with all scary religious pictures.

322
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:20,708
It wouldn't have to be
a bloody crucifixion.

323
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:24,103
It could just be an
image of a happy animal.

324
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:26,157
I don't know,
a smiling penguin or...

325
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:28,104
or perhaps a
peaceful-looking giraffe.

326
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,442
You think I should put up
a stained-glass window

327
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:33,311
of a peaceful-looking giraffe
on the side of my diner?

328
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,670
I'm just spitballing.
Nothing's written in stone.

329
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:36,666
Oh, well, that's good.

330
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,200
How about diamond shapes?

331
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,904
You know what, T.J.?
Why don't we just get to work?

332
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,726
- You're in a bit of a mood.
- I'm not in a mood, damn it.

333
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:49,249
Okay! I'm sorry
I said anything.

334
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,753
I won't say anything else.

335
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,882
You know what, T.J., forget it.
I'm sorry.

336
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,070
I really appreciate the
help you're giving me.

337
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,278
I know it was
last-minute. Okay?

338
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,580
No problem, buddy.

339
00:14:58,594 --> 00:15:00,401
What are brother-in-laws for?

340
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,041
Actually...

341
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,590
I'm glad for an excuse
to be out of the house.

342
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,045
Because being pregnant
makes Liz incredibly horny.

343
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,525
- T.J.
- Yeah, Luke?

344
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:11,701
Can we not talk about
my sister's sexuality?

345
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:14,319
Oh, yeah. Well, sure.

346
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:17,858
I guess it's something about all
those hormones racing around in there.

347
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:20,004
You should totally knock
Lorelai up, though.

348
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,021
T.J.

349
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:22,604
What, I'm not talking
about your sister.

350
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:24,955
I'm talking about your fiancée.

351
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,840
I  got a feeling pregnancy would
make Lorelai particularly randy.

352
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:30,343
T.J.!

353
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,319
Just think how cool it would be if
we raised our families together.

354
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,007
You should get
started now, though.

355
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,207
Right.

356
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:40,739
So how many kids you guys want?

357
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:42,408
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go get the primer.

358
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:43,818
- Now?
- Yeah. I'm just...

359
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,420
worried about the hardware
store's gonna run out.

360
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:46,714
'Cause you know,
it is the primer season.

361
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:48,490
- Good thinking.
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

362
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,760
So, now I know.

363
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:56,660
Know what?

364
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:58,789
That it's bad. It's terrible.

365
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,737
Sex.

366
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:03,308
Oh. No. Sex was bad?

367
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,550
You can drop the act, Rory.
It's okay.

368
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:07,353
I've known the real deal
about Santa Claus for years.

369
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:08,640
And now I know about sex.

370
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,153
- Lane --
- You know what's funny?

371
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,435
I really thought my mother
was being an insane prude

372
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:15,110
when she said that sex
was horrible for women.

373
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:17,057
But now I can see that,
in fact,

374
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:19,408
my mother was the only
woman who wasn't willing

375
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:23,647
to maintain this ridiculous,
pervasive, media-supported charade.

376
00:16:23,662 --> 00:16:26,667
What ridiculous, pervasive,
media-supported charade?

377
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:27,801
That sex is normal.

378
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,870
That sex is a
wonderful part of life.

379
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,663
That sex is sexy.

380
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,045
I mean,
can we just not admit it?

381
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,050
Sex is not sexy.
Sex is horrible.

382
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:36,939
Sex doesn't have
to be horrible.

383
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,843
In a way, I'm impressed with
the depth of the conspiracy.

384
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:44,439
If you think about it, it says something
about the potential power of women

385
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,243
that the entire
gender could collude

386
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,889
in creating the
"sex is sexy" myth.

387
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:50,807
So sex with Zach was bad?

388
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,714
Unbelievably bad.

389
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,201
Every time?

390
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:56,657
Yeah, right. Every time.

391
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,384
You only did it once.

392
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,264
That's right, and I'm out.

393
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:02,105
Well, the first
time can be weird.

394
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,254
I mean, my first time definitely
had its weird aspects,

395
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:06,403
but it gets better.
It gets good.

396
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,527
Um, sorry.
I just don't believe you.

397
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,289
Um... okay. You have to walk
me through what happened.

398
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:15,972
I mean, not graphically,
but help me out here.

399
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:19,186
Okay. So we decided that,
for our first time,

400
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,998
since it was such a big
deal and everything,

401
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,937
since we've been waiting
and waiting and --

402
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:24,393
God, if I'd known what
it was going to be like,

403
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:25,620
I would have gladly
kept waiting.

404
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:29,237
But anyway, we decided to re-create
the scene in "From here to eternity."

405
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,394
Wow. Ambitious.
Sex on the beach.

406
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:33,618
Anyway, the whole
thing was a disaster.

407
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:35,355
Because you know what
movies don't tell you?

408
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,715
That sand is basically dirt.

409
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,498
It was dirty. It was cold.

410
00:17:39,513 --> 00:17:40,543
My hands were shaking.

411
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,604
I'm trying to remember stuff from
school about condoms and bananas.

412
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:46,154
And then suddenly I realize,
we got crabs,

413
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,234
live ones that are
scuttling all over us.

414
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:51,475
And Zach starts freaking out because,
apparently, he's afraid of shellfish.

415
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,798
And it's getting
colder and dirtier.

416
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:56,895
And at some point,
this pervert with a snorkel mask

417
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,070
appears out of nowhere.
And I'm thinking,

418
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:01,805
"we took three buses from
Pedro's apartment for this."

419
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,185
Oh, Lane.

420
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:06,637
Yeah, just talking about it
makes me feel sick and queasy.

421
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:08,961
Well, you are sick and queasy.
You have a parasite.

422
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:09,917
But, okay.

423
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:13,141
Once you feel better, you really should
try sex again indoors in a bed.

424
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:15,348
I'm open to the idea
of a sexless marriage.

425
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,263
I mean, it happens for some people,
eventually. Why wait?

426
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:20,134
Try a bed first. Seriously.

427
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,944
You would not believe what a comforter
can do in this kind of situation.

428
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,771
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be in Asia right now?

429
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:28,340
How come you're not traipsing
around Thailand with Logan?

430
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,127
Um, Logan's job started.

431
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:32,082
He's far, far away in London.

432
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:33,644
You're lucky.

433
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:35,325
Yeah.

434
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:50,755
Sorry.

435
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:53,143
Oh. Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

436
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:55,262
Are you fine, really?

437
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,651
Because, I mean,
you don't have to be fine.

438
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:01,162
Because this is really
weird and really hard and...

439
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:04,010
- I'm not exactly fine.
- You're not?

440
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:05,158
Of course not.

441
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:07,605
Well, that's too bad because I am.
I'm fine.

442
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,370
Well... okay.

443
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,614
You know, maybe you should
punch Christopher's lights out.

444
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,492
- That seemed to do it for me.
- What?

445
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:15,689
Oh, so your boyfriend
didn't tell you.

446
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:17,139
You punched Christopher?

447
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:19,170
You two need to work on
your communication skills.

448
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,408
- Oh, stop it.
- What?

449
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:21,818
Christopher is
not my boyfriend.

450
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:22,911
I don't care if he is.

451
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,326
I mean, you can date whoever
or whatever you want.

452
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,034
I couldn't care less. I'm fine.

453
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,067
Okay, fine.
Well, if you're so fine,

454
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,530
the next time you get a hankering
to punch someone else, don't, okay?

455
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:35,159
If you need to take your anger
out on someone, take it out on me.

456
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,711
I'm the one you're mad at.
I'm the one who deserves it.

457
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:39,761
Look, you're the one
who's still hung up here.

458
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:41,278
I'm telling you, I'm over it.

459
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,230
I mean, I guess it's just not as
big a deal to me as it is to you.

460
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:46,032
Oh, it's not as big a deal?

461
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,192
Yeah, so what? We're not getting
married. It's okay by me.

462
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,904
I mean, you're the one who
proposed in the first place.

463
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:03,575
It looks good.

464
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:05,884
If you say so.
It's no Sistine chapel.

465
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:06,891
Well, that's true.

466
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:09,347
- It's no Taj Mahal.
- No, it is not the Taj Mahal.

467
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,763
So, look,
the window guy's coming by tomorrow,

468
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,218
and he and I are
gonna put it in, so...

469
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:16,119
after this coat,
you're free to go, okay?

470
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:18,275
And thanks for the help.
It really looks good.

471
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:19,581
You sure you don't
want any of this?

472
00:20:19,614 --> 00:20:20,943
No, I'm sure.

473
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,157
- You stop drinking beer?
- No.

474
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,767
It makes you kind of bloated,
but to me, it's worth it.

475
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:28,086
I'm psyched Kirk's
got a liquor license.

476
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,806
How come you quit
drinking beer?

477
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,330
Whoever said I quit
drinking beer?

478
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:32,565
You know what I like?

479
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,579
Drinking beer outside.

480
00:20:34,595 --> 00:20:35,924
I don't know,
maybe it's 'cause I grew up

481
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:37,917
watching my dad drink
out behind the tool shed,

482
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:40,200
and it's got this
romantic image for me.

483
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:42,455
- But that's my thing.
- Your thing is drinking beer outside?

484
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:44,191
Beer outside is the greatest.

485
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:47,583
Oh, except for at ice-skating rinks,
of course.

486
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:48,170
Of course.

487
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:49,695
Yeah, there's
something about the way

488
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,833
the zamboni exhaust
mixes with the beer

489
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:54,221
that's really just
out of this world.

490
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:57,836
Speaking of which, guess what I just
got -- tickets to the hockettes.

491
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,657
You know the hockettes,
the ice-skating girls? They're amazing.

492
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:04,215
They do everything the rockettes do,
only they do it with ice skates on.

493
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,345
Oh, that's great, T.J.

494
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,157
Guess how many tickets I got.

495
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,319
Four.

496
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:11,618
And who did I think might
like to go with me and Liz?

497
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:14,294
President and Mrs.
Bush. Just kidding.

498
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:16,690
- You and Lorelai.
- Oh, gee.

499
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:19,914
I don't...
think we can make that.

500
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:22,953
Come on! When's the last time
we all had a wild night out?

501
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,226
Yeah, you know,
I think I'm doing something that week.

502
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,165
Man, that sucks.
Wait, which week?

503
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:28,851
Uh, the week of the rockettes.

504
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:29,916
Which is which week?

505
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:31,241
The week they're here.

506
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:32,812
They're in town a whole month!

507
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,682
And I'm fully willing
to switch my tickets

508
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:36,590
for whichever night
is best for you guys.

509
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:38,290
Yeah, I don't --
I don't think so.

510
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:40,321
- Come on.
- I...

511
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:44,072
Lorelai and I... broke up.

512
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,973
- T.J., okay!
- It's okay, buddy.

513
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:52,836
It's okay. Let it out.
There is no shame in experiencing pain.

514
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:54,045
I'm having trouble breathing.

515
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,227
You are coming over to dinner
tonight with me and Liz.

516
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,429
Hello, honorable Rory-San.

517
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:20,904
You've made Asia for me?

518
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:23,774
Mm-hmm. Here's your kimono,
honorable Rory-San.

519
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:25,411
Thank you.

520
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,100
You made crazy Asia.

521
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:30,372
Well, actually, believe it or not,
but this is an exact replica

522
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:32,787
of Japan, China,

523
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,830
Vietnam, Cambodia,

524
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:36,642
Hong Kong, Korea,

525
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,904
and any other Asian countries that might
have slipped my mind for the moment.

526
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:41,092
This is exactly what you
would see in the other Asia.

527
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:42,128
The one that's not
in our living room.

528
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:43,681
Yeah, the old Asia.

529
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,282
The first attempt, I like to call it
"The prototype".

530
00:22:46,294 --> 00:22:47,910
Asia's a lot smaller
than I thought,

531
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,732
more intimate.
And more fragrant.

532
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:52,832
Yes, well, miss Patty donated
a bottle of her opium perfume,

533
00:22:52,845 --> 00:22:54,473
- and I spritzed it around a little.
- A little.

534
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:57,356
Well, little at first,
and then I tripped on my flip-flop

535
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:58,192
and broke the bottle.

536
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,915
Asia's so pretty.
I love all the lanterns and...

537
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:02,758
Oh, the poster of Mao.
Very nice.

538
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:05,700
And one of Sandra Oh. Because oddly,
you have a poster of Sandra Oh.

539
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:06,900
Well, she's a goddess.

540
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:09,107
And those aren't posters.
They're billboards.

541
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,257
You've lost perspective.

542
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:12,184
Ah. I see you feng
shuied the furniture.

543
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:15,118
Because it was so unfeng shuied before.
It was ridiculous.

544
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:16,902
Here --
to document our journey.

545
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:17,880
Xie xie.

546
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,802
Oh, god bless you.

547
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:20,470
That's "thank you" in mandarin.

548
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:22,743
I knew that. Just testing you.

549
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:25,006
Perhaps I shall
outline our itinerary.

550
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:26,512
Perhaps we shall.

551
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:29,706
All right, well,
first stop is Japan,

552
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,461
land of the rising sun,

553
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:33,417
ruled by Hello Kitty,

554
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,729
where we are gonna
make our own sushi.

555
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:37,685
You, me, and raw fish?
Is that safe?

556
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:39,929
Well, I took a lesson,
and if you're really nervous,

557
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:41,415
then we can skip the fugu.

558
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:45,088
After we're stuffed with sushi,
we will take an invisible rickshaw

559
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:47,545
to the rice paddies, i.e.
your room,

560
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,921
Where we will spend
hours origamiing.

561
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:52,694
- Paper cranes!
- Yeah, and paper bulldozers

562
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,071
and paper dump trucks and whatever
else your little heart desires.

563
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:57,864
Then, we'll take a bullet
train straight back to Tokyo

564
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,500
where we'll relax
with some tai chi

565
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:04,480
in preparation for the
kabuki play I wrote.

566
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:06,197
Tai chi's actually chinese.

567
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,491
Duh. I know that.

568
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:09,604
We're gonna teach
it to the japanese.

569
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:11,665
- That's nice of us.
- We're very nice that way.

570
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:13,996
All right. So, finally,
we will conclude our journey

571
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:16,192
with some fortune cookies
and dessert sushi.

572
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,455
Dessert sushi --
I do love Asia.

573
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:22,281
And that will be followed
by an educational video,

574
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,782
which includes, but is not limited to,
"Bridge on the river Kwai,"

575
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:28,361
"The joy luck club," "Karate
kid," "Shanghai surprise,"

576
00:24:28,374 --> 00:24:30,355
The Bruce Lee classic
"Enter the dragon,"

577
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,349
The Tom Selleck
classic "Mr. Baseball,"

578
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:34,499
- and/or "Breakfast at Tiffany's."
- "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?

579
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:38,191
Yeah, starring Mickey Rooney in his
tour-de-force racist performance

580
00:24:38,207 --> 00:24:40,080
as holly golightly's
japanese landlord.

581
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:41,539
Oh, yeah, he's so bad.

582
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:42,882
All right,
let's make some sushi.

583
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:44,022
But I'm scared.

584
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:47,275
Oh, I'll let you in on a secret.
The fish is really fried chicken.

585
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,363
You are honestly
asserting that you like

586
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,377
the "tootsie-roll marshmallow
twizzler" roll better

587
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:53,996
than the "butterfinger junior
mint chocolate-chip jujube" roll?

588
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,026
Call me crazy. But I just don't
think butterfingers go with jujubes.

589
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,379
Crazy.

590
00:24:58,395 --> 00:25:00,776
The limitations of your
palate astound me.

591
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,542
Hey, I liked the "oreo
red hot" sashimi.

592
00:25:02,554 --> 00:25:03,347
Me too.

593
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:04,661
See, I'm not a hater.

594
00:25:04,674 --> 00:25:08,690
Did you notice how the red hots
acted as a dessert-sushi wasabi?

595
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:10,646
I did,
which is something we should remember

596
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:12,082
when we go to
mass-market these.

597
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,336
I'm telling you, the invention of
dessert sushi is gonna make us

598
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:15,835
- our first million.
- And our second.

599
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,558
I'd like our third
to be go-go dancing.

600
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:18,770
Sounds like a plan.

601
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,678
You know,
I'm really not following this plot.

602
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:23,057
Okay, um... in the last scene,

603
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,981
there was a sign that said,
"No shirt, no shoes, no service."

604
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:30,863
And this guy, shirtless guy,
is angry about that -- angry.

605
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:34,057
And he's like, "no, I'm not gonna
wear a shirt! I hate shirts!"

606
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,116
End that really pissed those
other guys off.

607
00:25:36,131 --> 00:25:39,800
Hey, you know what would be
amazing and really asian?

608
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:41,497
Fried ice cream.

609
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:43,465
Oh, cows must envy
your stomach.

610
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:44,220
They do.

611
00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:45,479
I'm so full, I can't move.

612
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:47,762
I feel like one of those cats
that's bred to have no legs.

613
00:25:47,774 --> 00:25:49,764
Don't get me wrong --
my stomach's ready to explode.

614
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,009
This is not a physical hunger.
It's more of a spiritual hunger.

615
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:53,311
- For fried ice cream.
- Yeah.

616
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:55,845
It's an eastern-philosophy thing.
You wouldn't understand.

617
00:25:56,241 --> 00:26:00,036
So, how do you think one actually
goes about frying ice cream?

618
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,933
Probably in a frying pan.

619
00:26:02,073 --> 00:26:04,842
Uh-oh. Bit of a situation here.

620
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:05,616
What?

621
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:08,004
We are out of ice cream.

622
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,306
I'm a cat with no legs.

623
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:12,369
We can't answer it.
We're out of the country.

624
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:14,411
No ice cream. Unbelievable.

625
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:17,214
One time I feel like cooking,
there's no ice cream to fry.

626
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:19,371
Lor, hey, it's me.

627
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:21,088
Just still trying to reach you.

628
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:22,382
Sorry I missed
your call before.

629
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:24,683
But I wasn't calling about that
whole "Luke hitting me" thing.

630
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:28,003
I don't care about that.
I just want to talk to you.

631
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:29,509
I want to talk to you
about the other night.

632
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,158
I know you said it was
just a one-night thing,

633
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:33,191
but I want to talk about it,

634
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,452
and about you and me, so...

635
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:38,168
call me so we can talk.

636
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,719
Okay. Bye.

637
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:43,654
So...

638
00:26:44,513 --> 00:26:46,310
You slept with dad.

639
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:49,916
Yeah. I did.

640
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,432
You slept with dad.

641
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,741
Um, that's just...

642
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,756
I can't believe
you slept with dad.

643
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:58,605
Is that why you and Luke broke up,
because you slept with dad?

644
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,676
No, honey. No, I...

645
00:27:00,692 --> 00:27:02,202
believe me, no.

646
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,232
Um, Luke and I had
broken up before.

647
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:07,362
For how long?
I mean, it couldn't have been long.

648
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:11,090
Because you and Luke have only been
broken up for what, like three days.

649
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,307
Yeah, it was that night.

650
00:27:13,322 --> 00:27:15,657
The night you and
Luke broke up. Wow.

651
00:27:15,671 --> 00:27:19,126
So you just rushed right over there
the minute you were free, huh?

652
00:27:19,144 --> 00:27:19,905
Rory.

653
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:21,428
Sounds like you were
in quite a hurry.

654
00:27:21,444 --> 00:27:24,305
Did you put a dummy in the passenger
seat so you could use the car-pool Lane?

655
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:24,911
Rory.

656
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:27,489
What? You didn't think of it?
In too much of a rush, I guess.

657
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:29,890
I hope you buckled your seat belt.
You're supposed to buckle your seat belt

658
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:31,049
even if you're in a rush.

659
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:32,189
Hey, Rory --

660
00:27:32,205 --> 00:27:34,713
No, don't "Rory" me.
You don't get to "Rory" me.

661
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:36,373
You slept with dad.

662
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:39,585
Yeah. I-I-I...I know.

663
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:41,637
Are you and dad an item now?

664
00:27:41,651 --> 00:27:43,632
No, it was nothing.
I mean, it...

665
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:45,339
it had nothing to do
with me and Luke.

666
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:47,830
What happened between me
and your dad was nothing.

667
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:48,674
It was nothing.

668
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,250
Mom, you slept with dad.

669
00:27:50,264 --> 00:27:52,389
For the love of god,
will you stop saying that?

670
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,506
No, I can't stop saying
it because it happened.

671
00:27:54,522 --> 00:27:56,071
And you're trying to
pretend like it didn't.

672
00:27:56,104 --> 00:27:58,364
I'm not perfect, okay?
People make mistakes.

673
00:27:58,378 --> 00:28:00,473
I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow dyed
her hair that dark brown.

674
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:01,813
It was very unflattering.

675
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:04,116
If she's not perfect,
how do you expect me to be?

676
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:06,820
Yeah, because what you did is
equivalent to dying your hair.

677
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,164
That's great.

678
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,579
Things were finally
good between you two

679
00:28:10,594 --> 00:28:11,943
And between me and dad.

680
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,849
Did you not care that things were
finally really good between me and dad?

681
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,227
I mean, do you not want us to be close?
Did you mean to ruin that?

682
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:18,962
No! God, no!

683
00:28:18,978 --> 00:28:20,938
I love that dad's been good

684
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,701
and that things with you
and dad have been good.

685
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:26,596
I...I was hurting.
I was heartbroken.

686
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,486
And...it happened.

687
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:29,830
I slept with your dad.

688
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:31,958
It's over now,
and it was a mistake.

689
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,971
I can't believe you
didn't tell me this.

690
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:36,272
I mean, first of all,
you say you don't want to talk.

691
00:28:36,288 --> 00:28:38,537
So I figure you're going
through some hard emotional time

692
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,274
and you need some space.
That's fine.

693
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,940
But what you didn't tell me
is that you slept with dad.

694
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:44,549
No, instead you're going around

695
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:48,050
joking about, you know,
origami and marshmallow sushi,

696
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:49,845
like I'm some idiot 5-year-old.

697
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:51,983
Rory, I was gonna tell you.

698
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,709
- I just wanted --
- You know what, mom?

699
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:56,173
If you're heartbroken,
you rent "An affair to remember,"

700
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:59,616
you have a good cry, and drown your
sorrows in a pint of ice cream.

701
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:02,080
You get a hideously
unflattering breakup haircut.

702
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:04,334
You don't sleep with dad.

703
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,024
Honey, we're home.

704
00:29:14,037 --> 00:29:15,558
Hi.

705
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:21,175
Keep your hands off me,
you sex maniac.

706
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:23,910
Oh, big brother,
I'm so, so sorry.

707
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:24,494
Aw, thanks.

708
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:26,212
Come in, come in.
Make yourself at home.

709
00:29:26,227 --> 00:29:27,315
Dinner's still in the oven,

710
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:30,614
so we have time to have
a cocktail here and talk.

711
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:33,079
Cocktail hour.
Pretty swanky stuff, huh?

712
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:34,507
- Very, yeah.
- Sit, sit.

713
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,127
You should be the one
that's sitting, Liz.

714
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:37,643
- I'm fine.
- She's fine.

715
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:39,063
Plus, it's good for
her to move around.

716
00:29:39,097 --> 00:29:40,925
Keeps all those
hormones circulating

717
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:43,609
so they don't settle in one place,
if you know what I mean.

718
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:46,112
White russian. T.J.

719
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:49,256
She's trying to liquor me up.
I can see where this is going.

720
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:50,333
It better not.

721
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:52,213
We're really into white
russians recently.

722
00:29:52,227 --> 00:29:53,620
- It's our thing.
- Yeah.

723
00:29:53,637 --> 00:29:54,877
Of course, mine's a virgin.

724
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,700
Ironically.

725
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,043
Just cream.

726
00:29:58,056 --> 00:29:59,623
So...

727
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:01,274
I'm ready to talk.

728
00:30:01,287 --> 00:30:03,203
Oh, you know, it's really okay.

729
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:05,905
I don't need to talk.
It's just nice to be here.

730
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,115
So was it Anna?

731
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:09,224
What? No. It wasn't Anna.

732
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,566
- You sure?
- Look, it wasn't Anna, okay?

733
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:14,299
Lorelai and I broke up,
and I'd really rather not talk about it,

734
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,342
so... if you don't want to
talk about something else,

735
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:19,168
let's just sit here and
drink our white russians.

736
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,555
Lane?

737
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:24,531
Lane?

738
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:25,366
I'm in here.

739
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,709
Is Zach or Brian here?

740
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:27,742
No.

741
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:31,121
Sorry I didn't call first. I don't
know the protocol for married friends.

742
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:33,537
I just had to get
out of my house.

743
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:34,890
If I were there for
one more second,

744
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:37,007
I think I would have had
to karate-chop my mom.

745
00:30:37,024 --> 00:30:39,231
I swear,
just chopped her in half.

746
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:40,863
I guess I...

747
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:43,981
Lane, are you okay?
Did the doctor say you have a parasite?

748
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:46,206
In a manner of speaking.

749
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,851
I'm pregnant.

750
00:30:49,865 --> 00:30:51,651
- Shut up.
- I'm pregnant.

751
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,186
- You're not.
- I am.

752
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:54,116
- No.
- Yes.

753
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:56,660
I went to the doctor and he told me.
I'm pregnant with a baby.

754
00:30:56,673 --> 00:30:58,088
- No.
- Yes.

755
00:30:58,101 --> 00:31:00,849
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

756
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,419
Oh, my god. Wow.

757
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:05,752
Wow. How did Zach take it?

758
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,737
He didn't. I haven't told him yet.
I haven't told anyone.

759
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,665
I just came back here
and sat here. Pregnant.

760
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:11,150
- You're not.
- I am.

761
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:12,283
- Really?
- Really.

762
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:14,316
I guess the combination
of salt water

763
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:16,770
and seaweed and discount
mexican condoms

764
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:19,645
and terrible,
terrible sex leads to a baby.

765
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:20,655
A baby.

766
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,916
A baby. Sex sucks so bad.

767
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,434
Sex sucks worse than I thought.

768
00:31:24,446 --> 00:31:27,425
You only did it one time, and --
wow, a baby.

769
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:29,112
That's what you get,
folks, for making whoopee.

770
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:30,310
You're going to be a mother.

771
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:32,393
When the doctor told me,
I just started throwing up.

772
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:33,804
Well, you had morning sickness.

773
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:35,462
This was a different
kind of throwing up.

774
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,368
This was the kind of
throwing up that you do

775
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:39,414
when you have to do
something that you can't do.

776
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:40,938
You're going to be
a great mother.

777
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:42,654
Maybe someday, but not now.

778
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,909
I have a picture in my
head of me as a mother.

779
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:46,997
You know, I can imagine it,
and in that picture,

780
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:49,137
I'm wearing a skirt and heels,
and my hair is up in a bun.

781
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,915
And I'm pushing one of those really
fancy british baby carriages

782
00:31:52,932 --> 00:31:55,043
that are called silver
surfers or something.

783
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:57,270
Very Madonna in her
british-mommy phase.

784
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:59,717
When I'm a mom,
I'll be calm and wise

785
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,672
and have my act together.

786
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,263
I am not calm and not wise,

787
00:32:04,277 --> 00:32:06,197
and I really,
really don't have my act together.

788
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:08,961
You don't have to wear heels
and push a pram to be a mother.

789
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:10,216
A pram! See?

790
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,769
I didn't even remember
the word pram.

791
00:32:11,785 --> 00:32:13,025
Mothers know the word pram.

792
00:32:13,043 --> 00:32:14,678
Mothers don't have to
know the word pram.

793
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:16,021
Yes! Yes, they do!

794
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:17,255
They have to know
all sorts of things.

795
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,950
They have to know what to
do when your baby is crying

796
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,438
and how to change a diaper

797
00:32:21,454 --> 00:32:24,392
And how to use your wrist to
test if the bottle is too hot.

798
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:26,108
Why the wrist? I don't know.
I have no idea.

799
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:28,322
I think because it's handy,
no pun intended,

800
00:32:28,338 --> 00:32:31,095
and it's sensitive.
Wrists are sensitive.

801
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:33,568
It's just one false move,
one misstep,

802
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:36,275
and I'll ruin it.
I'm still making mistakes, Rory.

803
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,540
Example "a" -- I'm pregnant.

804
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:39,805
I can't be making mistakes
when I'm a mother.

805
00:32:39,818 --> 00:32:42,144
I'm not the person I need to
be to be able to do this.

806
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,791
I'm not perfect yet.
I'm so not perfect.

807
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:45,414
You don't have to be perfect.

808
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:47,867
I mean,
even Gwyneth Paltrow makes mistakes,

809
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,289
like "Shallow Hal"

810
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,101
and that other movie
that nobody saw

811
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:52,636
where she played a stewardess.

812
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,456
So who's perfect? Nobody.

813
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,232
Not even mothers.

814
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:57,758
Yeah.

815
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:00,548
I'm scared.

816
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,646
I know you are,
but you can do this.

817
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:06,035
First of all, you are great.

818
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,498
And second of all,
you have nine long months

819
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,934
to study about
bottles and wrists.

820
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,419
That's true.

821
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:15,670
And, already,
you are way ahead of a lot of people

822
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:17,781
as far as parenting skills go.
Like Britney.

823
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:19,880
Britney Spears does not know
which end of a baby goes up.

824
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,981
And Courtney Love?
She's no June Cleaver.

825
00:33:21,998 --> 00:33:24,274
Yeah, I bet I could be a better
mother than Courtney Love.

826
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:26,613
My sock drawer could be a better
mother than Courtney Love.

827
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:27,986
But, yes,
of course you would be.

828
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:30,957
And Michael Jackson --
you know not to name a child "Blanket."

829
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:31,908
I do know that.

830
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:34,592
Do not name your baby
after an inanimate object.

831
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:37,220
See? Way ahead of the pack.

832
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:39,495
Yeah. Hey...

833
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:44,297
I wonder if Blanket ever met
Tom and Katie's baby, Pillow.

834
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,065
Yeah, that would be
a perfect playdate.

835
00:33:46,076 --> 00:33:49,123
Yeah, when it's nap time,
they would be totally set.

836
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:52,145
And then they could invite
Gwyneth's Apple over afterward

837
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:53,497
for a little snack.

838
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:57,075
Banjo, Rachel Griffiths' baby,
could play for them.

839
00:33:57,086 --> 00:34:00,670
And then they could all jump
in Mia Farrow's Satchel

840
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:03,335
and make fun of, uh...
what's his face?

841
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:05,933
- Oh, Pilot Inspektor Lee.
- Yeah.

842
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,241
Little more time, looks like.

843
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:15,581
Can I set you up with another
white russian there, Luke?

844
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,932
One was plenty, thank you.

845
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:18,275
I can't believe it's not ready.

846
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,050
I thought for sure
it'd be ready by now.

847
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:21,764
I'm so sorry, Luke.
You must be starving.

848
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,985
Don't worry about it.

849
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:25,140
Maybe we should start with
a little first course.

850
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:26,588
Let me see what I have in here.

851
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:29,457
So what exactly are you making
that cooks for this long?

852
00:34:29,473 --> 00:34:30,915
Tuna loaf.

853
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:31,931
Tuna loaf.

854
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,525
That sounds amazing.

855
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,749
Well, it's very
thoughtful of you.

856
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:37,937
- Jello cups!
- Score.

857
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:42,290
Well, anyway,
invention is the mother of necessity.

858
00:34:44,106 --> 00:34:46,155
Eat your jello course.

859
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:49,933
So it's not surprising,
you know?

860
00:34:50,312 --> 00:34:51,200
What's not?

861
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:54,412
You and Lorelai breaking up.
I mean, that's not much of a surprise.

862
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,577
Yeah. I don't know.

863
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:59,552
I mean, I love Lorelai,
but the two of you were...

864
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:00,713
Were what?

865
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:02,130
You were never in sync.

866
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:03,617
I don't mean that in a bad way.

867
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:05,517
What do you mean,
we were never in sync?

868
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,930
Okay, for one thing,
you never really moved in together.

869
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:10,483
You wanted to,
but you never did.

870
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:12,472
You were in two
different places.

871
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,120
Well, there was a
logistical thing.

872
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:16,881
And then,
when you found out you had a daughter,

873
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,242
you never told her.

874
00:35:18,256 --> 00:35:19,981
That's not normal, Luke.

875
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,574
That's not how people in a
healthy relationship act.

876
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:26,022
It's like that
space-time-continuum thing.

877
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:28,304
You're on a plane over here,

878
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,358
and she's on this
plane over there,

879
00:35:30,372 --> 00:35:34,654
and you were both never here
nor there at the same time.

880
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:36,032
It's like string theory.

881
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:37,790
String theory?
What do you know about string theory?

882
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:39,620
Don't underestimate me, Luke.
I read.

883
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:41,432
And I watch
"Battlestar Galactica."

884
00:35:41,446 --> 00:35:44,751
Look, Lorelai and I
just did not work out.

885
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,698
You were on different planes.
It could have worked out

886
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:50,111
if there was a wormhole between
your plane and her plane.

887
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:51,924
We didn't need a wormhole.

888
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,987
It was like that
movie with, um,

889
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,369
Keanu Reeves and
Sandra Bullock.

890
00:35:55,382 --> 00:35:56,213
- Exactly!
- Yeah.

891
00:35:56,225 --> 00:35:58,082
Oh, yes! Exactly, exactly!

892
00:35:58,098 --> 00:35:59,906
You're living in
the same house, man,

893
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:02,273
but you are a
couple years apart

894
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:04,199
In the space-time continuum.

895
00:36:04,214 --> 00:36:05,743
What house? It was a bus.

896
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:09,121
Oh! I thought you were
talking about "Speed."

897
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,193
"Speed" applies, too.

898
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:12,975
Lorelai and I didn't break up

899
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:17,079
because we weren't on the same
place in a space-time continuum

900
00:36:17,095 --> 00:36:18,473
or because there
weren't any wormholes.

901
00:36:18,506 --> 00:36:21,127
We broke up because we
weren't right for each other.

902
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:23,343
Okay, it wasn't space.
It wasn't time.

903
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,307
It was us, okay?
We didn't belong together.

904
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,060
We never really...

905
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,122
belonged together.

906
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:32,801
We wanted to, but...

907
00:36:32,812 --> 00:36:34,661
we never did.

908
00:36:34,797 --> 00:36:36,551
That's it.

909
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:43,721
I am so excited.

910
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,473
It's cold.

911
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:55,354
The oven's cold.
The oven's broken.

912
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:56,956
Oh, man, still?

913
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:59,441
We forgot to fix the oven.

914
00:36:59,454 --> 00:37:01,761
Oh, Luke, I am so sorry.

915
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:04,784
I really wanted to make
you a home-cooked meal.

916
00:37:04,797 --> 00:37:07,248
I'll go the store.
I'll get something to make for us.

917
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:08,429
Oh, Luke.

918
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:10,251
That's okay, really.
I don't mind.

919
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:12,582
I'll get us some stuff and
make us a home-cooked meal.

920
00:37:12,594 --> 00:37:13,616
Your burners work?

921
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:16,195
Yeah, they work.
Okay, good. Great.

922
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:18,144
At least you'll have
a home-cooked meal.

923
00:37:18,157 --> 00:37:20,117
Okay, I'll be back in a bit.

924
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,222
Hey.

925
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,061
Well, I guess both of
us avoiding Doose's

926
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:39,894
didn't work out that well, huh?

927
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:41,505
Well, I wasn't
avoiding Doose's.

928
00:37:41,518 --> 00:37:44,257
Just the closest market
to Liz and T.J.'s house.

929
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,253
Right. Because you're
not affected by this.

930
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,593
You're not mad. I forgot.

931
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:51,854
No, I...I was mad.
I was really mad.

932
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,914
Yeah, I kind of figured.

933
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,886
I know I was a jerk.

934
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,970
I was just... mad.

935
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:00,801
I was the jerk.
I was such a jerk.

936
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:03,035
I'm not mad anymore. Well...

937
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,825
That's not true, but...

938
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:08,752
I won't be,
you know, eventually.

939
00:38:09,783 --> 00:38:11,428
Really.

940
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:13,009
Yeah?

941
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:14,908
Yeah.

942
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,805
Okay.

943
00:38:20,408 --> 00:38:22,810
It's not your fault.
It's not my fault.

944
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:25,190
It's just,
we're not right together, you know?

945
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,658
You're you, I'm me.

946
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,310
I just want to stop pretending
we're something else.

947
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,920
You don't belong with me.

948
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,804
You belong with someone like
Christopher, and I just...

949
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,307
Let's just stop
fighting it, okay?

950
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:41,069
And you go back to
being Lorelai Gilmore.

951
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:44,361
And I'll go back to being the guy
in the diner who pours your coffee.

952
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,783
My hand's getting cold.

953
00:38:51,845 --> 00:38:53,251
Okay.

954
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:54,841
Okay.
