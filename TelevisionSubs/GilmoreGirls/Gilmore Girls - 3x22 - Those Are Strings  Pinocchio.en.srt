1
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:13,461
Coming through! Heavy packs.

2
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:14,860
Out of our way, peace boy!

3
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:19,018
No offense, love the song. Carry on. Go.

4
00:00:25,848 --> 00:00:27,553
And wuss patrol, halt.

5
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:30,539
I've never known such pain.

6
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,234
We are so not walking around Europe

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,964
with those annoying things on our backs.

8
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:35,480
But we're backpacking through Europe.

9
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:37,169
How're we gonna do this without backpacks?

10
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,829
But all the time we've talked about backpacking,

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,728
I never actually pictured us with backpacks.

12
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:41,853
What were you picturing?

13
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:44,972
Spry, accommodating European men

14
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:47,574
with neat mustaches trailing after us, carrying our luggage,

15
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:51,035
hailing taxi cabs, constantly reminding us how beautiful we are.

16
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,758
No, it's just the two of us humping our backpacks around.

17
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:57,424
Well, at least my new walking shoes are all broken in.

18
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:59,923
If you count broken skin, broken toes.

19
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,807
- Don't do that. 
- Don't do what?

20
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,486
Don't take your shoes off. This is a restaurant.

21
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:05,648
I don't see a "No shirt, no shoes, no service" sign.

22
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:06,958
It's right here, don't do that.

23
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:08,151
We're in pain, Luke.

24
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:11,239
But it's great that you guys are bearing it so nobly. And can you move these?

25
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:12,324
Can? No.

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,743
Would if we could? Debatable.

27
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:18,069
- Look at that. 
- Spry and accommodating.

28
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:20,572
Hey, would you grow a mustache and follow us around Europe?

29
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:22,949
- Sorry, got travel plans of my own. 
- Really?

30
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:24,751
Yup, I'm closing down the diner for a couple of weeks

31
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,329
and taking Nicole on a little trip.

32
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:27,072
Fun.

33
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:30,557
We're driving through Western Canada and then taking a cruise up to Alaska.

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,288
- A cruise? 
- Intimate.

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,959
I guess.

36
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:35,431
- Is it? 
- The Love Boat.

37
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:35,950
What?

38
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,489
A cruise is a good spot to get down on one knee.

39
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:40,651
And do my ventriloquist act?

40
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:43,527
- And propose. 
- I have no plans to propose.

41
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:46,835
You don't now, but after you've had dinner at Captain Stubing's table

42
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,424
and Isaac's served you up a couple of mojitos.

43
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,624
Romantic cruises say commitment, my friend.

44
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,438
I am not committing and I am not proposing, so drop it.

45
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:56,506
- Okay, it's dropped. 
- Really drop it.

46
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:59,267
- Did I not just say it's dropped? 
- Heard it with my own ears.

47
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:02,371
The Love Boat.

49
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:04,715
If you'd get a radio in here, I wouldn't have to do that.

50
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:07,546
Okay, so your graduation is Wednesday at four, correct?

51
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:09,590
You know, you really don't have to go to it, Luke.

52
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,289
I want to. I feel like I've been through this whole Chilton thing with you.

53
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,844
Okay, good, I want you there.

54
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:14,936
Good. So what do you want?

55
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:17,398
- Are you hungry? 
- I'm just sore.

56
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:18,643
Let's go home and rest.

57
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:23,625
Hey, wait, don't leave these.

58
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:24,896
Store 'em for us.

59
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:26,994
Yeah, until we hire a flatbed truck to carry 'em home for us.

60
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,158
My left foot hurts. My right foot hurts. Carry me.

61
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:31,530
- You carry me. 
- You carry me.

62
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:32,637
- No, you carry me. 
- Come on.

63
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:33,591
- What is taking him so long? 
- I don't know. Luke, come on!

64
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:38,685
Oh, god, I walked right into a cobweb.

65
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:41,424
So, what's the shape of the place?

66
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,538
- It was a really big cobweb. 
- Terrible. So what's the story?

67
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:47,047
- Is there a spider on me? 
- Suck it up, big guy, and tell us the scoop.

68
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:49,755
- It's not so bad. 
- So it's not so good.

69
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:51,256
Not so bad is not so good.

70
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:54,317
- No, really, it's not bad. The floors... 
- Are rotted!

71
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,160
- I knew it. They need to be replaced. 
- It's a disaster.

72
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:58,260
The floors are fine. They need refinishing,

73
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:00,948
but they're really nice quartersawn oak floors.

74
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:01,809
What about the roof?

75
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:03,067
- The roof... 
- Is shot?

76
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:04,727
- It's caving in. 
- The walls, too?

77
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:06,141
Along with our hopes and dreams.

78
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:08,603
No, the roof is fine. Some shingles need replacing,

79
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:10,614
but that looks like the extent of it.

80
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:13,252
- Almost done here, folks. 
- Great, Kirk. You find any mold?

81
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:15,329
You mean, did I find any silent death?

82
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:16,549
- Not so far, no. 
- Good.

83
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:19,754
I did tell you about the dangers of mold, right? And Ed McMahon's dog?

84
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,588
Yes, you did.

85
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:22,778
Suffered memory loss due to mold infestation.

86
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:25,166
- Forgot how to sit. 
- Yes, it was horrible.

87
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,279
It's a growth industry right now, pardon the pun.

88
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,427
Mold is money.

89
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:30,787
I just wish I wasn't so scared of finding it.

90
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,686
- Well, don't look too hard then. 
- Thanks.

91
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:36,286
So, what's the final prognosis, Luke? We're not buying a money pit, are we?

92
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:39,395
You're gonna spend money, but it's not a pit. Might be a steal.

93
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,573
It's a steal!

94
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,405
We are such great businesswomen.

95
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,838
Once you start work, you can probably have this place up

96
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,953
and running in four or five months.

97
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,501
Which will give the Independence Inn owners plenty of time to find our replacements.

98
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,692
We could be running our own inn in less than a year.

99
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,769
What's the matter Kirk? Mold?

100
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:57,505
No, mouse!

101
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,373
We all knew that our education at Chilton would be exemplary,

102
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:02,840
but it was the people at Chilton.

103
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:05,359
All my friends - Hi Marcy, love you.

104
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,074
Cody and Debbie, love you, too.

105
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,322
The faculty, the administrative staff.

106
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,297
Even our janitorial staff - Jaime and Joachim.

107
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:14,464
I can't count the number of times you guys made me laugh...

108
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,000
- Does she need medical attention? 
- Paris.

109
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:18,727
Jaime and Joachim aren't even getting a copy of this. She's maroon.

110
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:20,465
It's the end of the year, people get nostalgic.

111
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:22,642
So, how's your valedictorian speech coming along?

112
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:26,512
Oh, it's okay. Pretty standard. Boring.

113
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:28,365
'We love the school, blah blah blah.'

114
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,969
No one listens to those things anyhow, so -

115
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,481
Relax, I'm okay with you making valedictorian over me.

116
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,699
Oh, good, thanks.

117
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:35,421
Sure.

118
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,744
I actually googled the personal histories of Ivy League valedictorians

119
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:41,744
going back twenty-five years, and found some enlightening statistics.

120
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:44,745
They don't necessarily do too well in later life, did you know that?

121
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,025
- No. 
- Oh, yeah.

122
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,211
A lot of business failures, crumbled marriages, suicides, obesity.

123
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,070
A bunch died in car crashes, several did time,

124
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:54,641
one suffocated when his cat fell asleep on his face.

125
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:55,763
Okay, well, thanks again.

126
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:58,846
Okay, A/V geek, just pan my body nice and slow.

127
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,520
- Why? 
- Yeah, why?

128
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:02,548
Because I'll never look better than I do now.

129
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:03,961
Come on ladies, we don't have all day.

130
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:09,705
A/V geek, I'm going to need six minutes.

131
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:11,365
- You're only allowed two. 
- Rolling!

132
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:12,337
Rolling.

133
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,938
Fellow Chilton seniors, it's been quite a year...

134
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:19,640
I hate this.

135
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,142
One guest. In the whole inn, one guy.

136
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:25,322
And I pulled towel duty today.

137
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,113
It's especially awful handling guest towels

138
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:30,638
when you know exactly which guests the towels belong to.

139
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:33,278
It's his mites on those towels.

140
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:34,759
Don't be gross.

141
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:37,734
This is degrading for a man of my capabilities.

142
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:39,484
Well, what about me? I've got no kitchen.

143
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:41,555
I'm a chef. My skills are deteriorating.

144
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,406
I need to saut�, emulsify, marinate.

145
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:46,864
I need more mental stimulation.

146
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:50,484
I need to frickin' fry a dead animal in a skillet. I'm going nuts.

147
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,660
- I should've been a dancer. 
- What?

148
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:55,362
My mother put me in dance school and I rebelled,

149
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:58,277
I wanted to kick the football. I should not have.

150
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:01,313
I've seen you dance and you jump around like a duck.

151
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:03,142
You know, I'm getting mighty sick of you.

152
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,713
Not as sick as I am of you.

153
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,647
You know what, you do his towels. I'm not doing his towels anymore.

154
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:09,941
I'm not doing his stupid towels. I hate that stupid guy

155
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,974
with his stupid newspaper. He's stupid.

156
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,017
Yo, guys, no bickering in front of the guest.

157
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,591
Tell it to Deney Terrio here. I should've been a dancer.

158
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:21,416
Lorelai, how long can we keep this up?

159
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:22,495
Keep what up?

160
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:24,560
We have one guest,

161
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,607
half the rooms are still closed from the fire,

162
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:30,341
most of the staff is laid off, I am doing mite towels,

163
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:33,571
and the owner's son is walking around with a bunch of men in suits.

164
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:35,431
Yeah, John's here. That can't be good.

165
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,783
John is here looking things over for the renovation

166
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:42,114
that will reopen all the closed rooms so we can be up and running again.

167
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:43,065
Stop worrying.

168
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,673
- Okay. 
- Okay.

169
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:49,604
Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.

170
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:52,215
- Lorelai, it's your mother. 
- Mother, hi.

171
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:55,497
I'm calling to find out how it's going to work at Rory's graduation.

172
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:57,295
Are we going to be sitting together?

173
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,782
Well, mmm... 

174
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,716
- Lorelai. 
- Sorry. Hmm.

175
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:04,786
Lorelai.

176
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:06,820
Mom, of course we'll be sitting together. We're family.

177
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,893
Well, I knew that. I just wasn't sure if you did.

178
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,310
Well, we're sitting together.

179
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,892
- Good. 
- Yes, it is.

180
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:13,296
Ask her about the gift, Emily.

181
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,181
- Dad? 
- He's on the other line.

182
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,796
Oh, sure got the quiet thing down there.

183
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,628
I'm on the upstairs portable, but I'm on my way downstairs.

184
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,359
I see your mother now. Hello Emily.

185
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:23,424
Hello Richard.

186
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:25,729
I'm on my way to the couch and am about to sit.

187
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,494
It's like the thrilling day of radio here.

188
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:29,481
We wanted to ask you about a gift for Rory.

189
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,340
It's a big gift, a little extravagant.

190
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:33,270
But it's a big occasion, so it makes sense.

191
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,444
We wanna buy her a car.

192
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:36,640
Well, I think that's a great idea.

193
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:38,443
- Really? 
- Wonderful.

194
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,972
Yeah, Rory needs to get back and forth from Yale a lot,

195
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:43,384
and the quicker she can do it, the more I get to see her,

196
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:45,252
so it's really kind of a present for me, too.

197
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:48,140
- Yes, right. 
- I suppose so.

198
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,424
- Didn't think of that. 
- Just not a gas guzzler.

199
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:54,188
- And no Ferrari's or Lamborghini's. 
- So nothing Italian?

200
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,296
No, it can be Italian, just sensible Italian.

201
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,080
All right, well, good.

202
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,703
I'm glad we had this settled.

203
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:03,399
Good. Well, maybe I'll see you at the graduation, maybe I won't.

204
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:05,502
- What? 
- See you there. Bye.

205
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:07,205
- Goodbye. 
- Bye.

206
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,923
Hey, you and your Armani posse want something to drink, John?

207
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:17,470
No, no, Lorelai. We're fine, thanks.

208
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:21,003
So, I've been lying to people about you all day.

209
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:21,964
About what?

210
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,810
Oh, about how it's not a big deal that you're walking around

211
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:27,961
with a concerned look on your face with a group of men

212
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:29,497
with concerned looks on their faces.

213
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:32,558
I think I've been lying to me a little, too.

214
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,125
We have to close off three more rooms.

215
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:35,042
Three rooms?

216
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,033
That'll leave us with two.

217
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:40,162
And, the estimate for the repairs to get everything back

218
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:42,103
to the quality we had and up to code...

219
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:44,647
- it's not pretty. 
- No, that's not pretty.

220
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,711
- Mom's leaning toward selling. 
- Selling.

221
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:49,973
- Nothing's final yet. 
- Yeah, nothing's final.

222
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:52,738
I just... Rory grew up here.

223
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:54,853
I grew up here.

224
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,873
Yeah, I better get back to my group.

225
00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:59,178
Right, sure, you go.

226
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,130
Hey, be careful not to trip over our guest.

227
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,277
I won't.

228
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:09,043
Sookie, Jackson, you better not be in bed.

229
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,811
- Are you expecting Lorelai? 
- No.

230
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,612
Come on. The night is young and the champagne's cold.

231
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:14,486
The champagne?

232
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:16,887
- Surprise! 
- What is this?

233
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:19,110
- It's a celebration. 
- For what?

234
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:21,988
Sookie, get some glasses, and Jackson, put some music on.

235
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,980
Whatever you want, just make it festive.

236
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:26,386
- Got it. 
- I don't know what this is, but it's fun.

237
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:29,606
Let's see. I've got Creedence Clearwater Revival.

238
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,975
Good energy, too hillbilly.

239
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,743
How you coming with those glasses, Sook?

240
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:35,260
Just wiping off the fancy ones.

241
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,004
Huey Lewis and the News? It's Sookie's.

242
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,222
Hey, we all have our guilty pleasures.

243
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,893
- Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass? 
- Ah, fun, festive, that's perfect! Crank it.

244
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,159
Okay, I've got some cold Dom for me and Jackson.

245
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,752
- Happens to be my brand. 
- Oh, I love this song.

246
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,493
And, for Sookie and little baby, whatever-it-is,

247
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,309
we've got the apple bubbly stuff.

248
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,157
- And cheers. 
- Cheers!

249
00:11:01,738 --> 00:11:03,386
Well, come on, what are we celebrating?

250
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,562
- Well, you ready? 
- Yeah.

251
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:06,555
Definitely!

252
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:08,906
The Independence Inn is closing.

253
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:14,860
- The inn is closing. 
- Not closing, closed. We're finished. It's all over.

254
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,314
They're boarding the place up as we speak.

255
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:17,150
Who wants more?

256
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:19,452
Well, did they find some gold in the basement or something

257
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,107
'cause I'm missing the celebrating angle.

258
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:24,045
You should always celebrate new challenges, and that's what this is.

259
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:25,305
A new challenge.

260
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,774
Yes. They'll be some severance pay, then nothing.

261
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:28,849
Nothing!

262
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,127
Nothing but exciting new challenges. Cheers!

263
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:33,104
The inn is closed.

264
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:38,480
I guess this means that you guys can focus solely on refurbishing the Dragonfly,

265
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:40,273
getting that up and running. That's exciting.

266
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:42,444
- Yes, it is. 
- Yeah, I agree.

267
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,383
But just drink some more. How're you feeling?

268
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,871
A little drunk, and all I'm drinking is apple juice.

269
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,359
Well, good, 'cause I've got another little piece of news for you.

270
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,445
We can't buy the Dragonfly because I can't swing my share of the money

271
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,200
because I no longer have a steady income.

272
00:11:57,435 --> 00:11:59,760
Wow, that is great.

273
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:02,454
I'm sorry, was that an exciting challenge too?

274
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:05,746
Absolutely. Yesterday our lives were boring and predictable.

275
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,742
We had jobs, we were gonna start our own business.

276
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:10,339
But now everything is wide open.

277
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:14,311
We can do anything we want because we're not penned in. That's good.

278
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:15,878
Yes, that's good.

279
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,151
And thinking of those new challenges is a nice way to distract me

280
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:21,376
from the fact that we don't work together anymore

281
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,107
so we're gonna see way less of each other.

282
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:27,917
Which will make our limited time together more enjoyable.

283
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:32,187
Right. And since I'm your vegetable supplier, I'm losing work,

284
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,256
and seeing my wife and close friend way less than before.

285
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,260
Cheers!

286
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:43,799
That would convert it into a town bylaw,

287
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:47,798
a minor but nonetheless important change from local ordinance,

288
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:52,612
giving us the leeway to enforce charter amendments five and six

289
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:58,802
and grandfathering in previously proposed statutes with no procedural delay.

290
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:03,825
So all those in favor of going ahead of this, say aye.

291
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:07,072
All those opposed?

292
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,718
People, what's going on?

293
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:14,066
- People! 
- Oh, sorry, Taylor.

294
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:16,083
What is the matter with you?

295
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:19,739
I think it might be the first time sixty people lost their train of thought all at the same time.

296
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:23,087
Yeah, Taylor, your voice always makes me think of my grocery list.

297
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,618
- We need croutons. 
- Got it.

298
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,133
Moving on.

299
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:29,786
Now, people, I know it's an unpleasant subject,

300
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:34,445
but the deer population in this town is reaching monstrous proportions.

301
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:35,658
Not this again.

302
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,884
- He's always going on about the deer. 
- Leave 'em alone, Taylor.

303
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:44,063
But they're taking over the town. We need to institute partial elimination.

304
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:47,938
- Partial elimination? 
- You wanna kill the little romping Bambi's?

305
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,461
People, do I have to detail the problems that these deer cause?

306
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:52,424
No, but you will.

307
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:55,961
Lyme disease, auto accidents, plane accidents.

308
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:58,122
- We have flying deer? 
- Oh, that's scary.

309
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:00,207
Yeah. Those ones you can snuff.

310
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:03,465
But the worst problem is the crop loss.

311
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,188
Dean, hand me the blow-up please.

312
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,380
Hey, Dean, he's paying you for all this, right?

313
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:08,768
Really, how much?

314
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:15,838
People, this is a randomly chosen but typical landscaped area in the town

315
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:19,080
that was denuded by these ruminant pests.

316
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:21,584
- Randomly chosen? 
- Taylor, that's your backyard.

317
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,658
This is a little self-serving.

318
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:26,955
- It might be my yard. 
- Might be?

319
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:30,192
Taylor, no one else has a "Kiss the Gardener" sign.

320
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:32,158
This is a trumped up problem.

321
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,296
So none of you are interested in addressing this scourge?

322
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:36,976
- I have a thought. 
- Go ahead, Kirk.

323
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,040
- A controlled hunt. 
- Guns?

324
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:41,676
- Not guns, wolves. 
- What?

325
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,990
You release a pack of wolves, they eat the deer, problem solved.

326
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,386
Of course, then you'll have to deal with your wolf problem.

327
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:50,974
I say that we defer this unsavory topic for another year.

328
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,946
- Now wait a minute. 
- All those in favor?

329
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:53,909
Aye!

330
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,490
Taylor's opposed. Meeting adjourned.

331
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,549
I missed the whole thing?

332
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:03,509
Yes, and I'm still semi-grounded,

333
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:05,449
so I only have a limited amount of time in the outside world.

334
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,181
Well, hurry and show me your prom pictures.

335
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:10,699
- These are them. 
- Lane, how many did you take?

336
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:13,530
Three hundred. I'll leave them with you, they're pretty self explanatory.

337
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,394
- What's this? 
- Our chicken piccata.

338
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,631
- Ah, and this? 
- Our chicken piccata after one bite.

339
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:19,152
So, don't tell me, two bites?

340
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,092
Okay, I think I can follow this.

341
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:22,977
Gotta run. Keep 'em in order.

342
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:23,699
I will.

343
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:40,140
Taylor's paying you to do all this work, isn't he?

344
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:44,039
He knows I need money, so he's helping me out with extra stuff to do.

345
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:46,547
- He's a good guy. 
- Yeah, he is a good guy.

346
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:49,852
A very good guy. So how are the old wedding plans?

347
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,293
They're fine.

348
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:54,805
You know, my mom's held about a million weddings at the inn

349
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:58,169
and I've worked on a lot of them, so I'm a fountain of useful tips.

350
00:15:58,405 --> 00:15:59,116
Good.

351
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,970
For instance, your photographer,

352
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,595
have him take candid photographs along with the other ones,

353
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:06,910
so that way you'll capture a lot of your favorite moments

354
00:16:06,993 --> 00:16:10,268
and you won't be stuck with just the stiff, you know, posed shots.

355
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:11,738
Candid, okay.

356
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,390
And if the ring bearer is younger than five years-old.

357
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:15,702
My nephew, he's three.

358
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:18,358
Don't give him the ring until the last second

359
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:20,570
because I have seen many a ring swallowed,

360
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:23,582
and well, it takes a couple days to get it back.

361
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,152
Good point.

362
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,143
It's actually been kind of overwhelming.

363
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:30,924
I mean, you have to rent the hall like a year in advance.

364
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,479
And make sure that your deposit is refundable as long as you can.

365
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:37,355
Yeah, it is. And then there's a lot of stuff that we have to buy, too, for our place.

366
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:39,766
Oh yeah, about that. Come on, sit.

367
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:46,188
- What's this? 
- Your wedding gift.

368
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:47,804
What?

369
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,267
You can get anything you want, but I've marked a bunch of pages

370
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,074
with stuff that I think would be most appropriate,

371
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:55,381
and I just wanted to get in early so I'd be the first one

372
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:56,940
to get you a blender, not the third one.

373
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,426
- You don't have to do this. 
- I know. That's why it's fun.

374
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:06,694
This has everything.

375
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,551
I'd recommend the mixing bowls, those are really nice.

376
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:13,187
Or a knife set and a sharpener. Sharpening's very important.

377
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:15,998
I learned that from Sookie. If you leave 'em too long, it's too late.

378
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:16,966
Respect your knives.

379
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,034
- Thanks, Rory. 
- You're welcome.

380
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:23,392
So just look through it with Lindsay and pick out what you want and I'll order it.

381
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:24,749
I will.

382
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:29,740
Bye, Dean.

383
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:31,918
Bye, Rory.

384
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,604
Maybe we should bring it in a bit more.

385
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:44,055
Oh sure, but first we'll have to use a medieval torture instrument to crush my ribs

386
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:47,228
and flatten my spinal cord in order to accommodate your sadistic wish there.

387
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:49,222
Don't use subtlety on us. We're slow.

388
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:51,685
I think she's saying that we don't need to bring it in anymore.

389
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,252
Take it off, you're done.

390
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:57,312
I should go. I've got a stupid job interview tomorrow morning,

391
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:59,272
- and you know what, I'm nervous. 
- Which place?

392
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:01,424
- Harrington's in Woodbridge. 
- Nice.

393
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,285
They want me to be their executive chef four nights a week.

394
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:07,885
God, I can't imagine working someplace else. And without my Lorelai!

395
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:10,220
But it's only a few months until the Dragonfly opens, right?

396
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:13,727
- You haven't told her yet. 
- Told me what?

397
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:16,615
- I was waiting for an opportunity. 
- To tell me what?

398
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:18,331
Which apparently is right now.

399
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,659
Okay, hon, listen.

400
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,622
We're not buying the Dragonfly.

401
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:28,551
- What? 
- It's just not the right time.

402
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:31,043
- You're crazy. It's the perfect time. 
- Not really.

403
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:33,430
But if you wait, someone else is gonna buy it. You said so yourself.

404
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,006
I'm gonna go, guys. Sorry to spill the beans.

405
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:37,435
That's okay. I'll see you later.

406
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:39,175
Mom, why put it off?

407
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:42,083
I mean, I know the Independence Inn closing is a setback.

408
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:42,821
Big one.

409
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:46,207
But we've got the rest of Grandpa's money, that's plenty to buy the Dragonfly Inn,

410
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:50,250
and we'll just scrimp on everything until it's all up and running and successful.

411
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:51,858
It would take a lot of scrimping.

412
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:54,562
Well, I'm a master scrimper. I would make the Olympic scrimping team.

413
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,535
- I'm that good, boy. 
- Honey, we didn't get financial aid for Yale.

414
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,180
- What? 
- No scholarships, no hardship money,

415
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,590
no money-off coupons, no gift certificates, nothing.

416
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,428
I don't understand, what happened?

417
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:07,624
Well, irony of ironies, the money I got from your grandpa

418
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:11,398
took us out of the running for financial aid 'cause it made it look like we have money.

419
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,117
Well, send them proof - a bank statement, a letter from Grandpa.

420
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:15,417
Here, take a picture of this couch -

421
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:17,023
no one will think we have money after looking at this couch.

422
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,979
- I tried everything, I swear. 
- Why didn't you tell me this?

423
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,887
With everything that's going on, finals and all your personal stuff,

424
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:24,937
- I didn't want you worrying. 
- But Grandpa's money -

425
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:27,548
- Is paying for Yale. 
- No! No way!

426
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,183
I'll take a student loan out from the bank. That's what banks are for.

427
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,047
Honey, I don't want you to be buried by loans the day you graduate from college.

428
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:36,452
then I'll major in something that'll immediately make me a lot of money

429
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,264
when I graduate. I'll major in business or engineering.

430
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,575
You are not changing your major from journalism because of my lack of money.

431
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:44,594
It's our lack.

432
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:48,542
Look, if you need to work as a low-paid intern for a magazine

433
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,907
or a stringer for some small-town newspaper

434
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,067
or Tom Brokaw's toupee comber-outer

435
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:56,857
before you make real money, then that's what you'll do.

436
00:19:56,949 --> 00:20:00,150
- There has to be another way. 
- I've looked. There's nothing.

437
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,440
This is so not fair to you.

438
00:20:01,578 --> 00:20:05,654
I'll have my own inn one day, I promise. But Yale comes first.

439
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:08,844
- What are you gonna do now? 
- Rail at God for awhile.

440
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,404
Tell her I said hi.

441
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:17,535
What happened to our packing elves who were gonna pack our packs over night?

442
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:18,304
How about this?

443
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,304
You hate the dress I made you that much?

444
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:22,743
Not for graduation, for Europe.

445
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:26,189
Oh, it's perfect. It's black so it won't show dirt or wrinkles,

446
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:29,319
and if you wear it with a moody look on your face like you're thinking of Bolsheviks,

447
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,997
they'll mistake you for Simone de Beauvoir. Pack it.

448
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,913
- It's too heavy. 
- So, was that a trick question?

449
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:35,832
We both need to cut weight from our packs.

450
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,327
I am doing my part here.

451
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:39,001
You don't need five pairs of boots.

452
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:41,075
I'll drop some boots if you drop some books.

453
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:43,145
- I can't drop books. 
- You can't bring twelve books.

454
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,506
You also need to cut your undergarments.

455
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:46,800
Don't forget, we'll rinse in Woolite every few days.

456
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:48,762
This is going to an uncomfortable place.

457
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:50,774
And your toothpaste - you have three full tubes.

458
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,228
- So? 
- Why three?

459
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:54,537
If I lose one, I'll have another to take its place.

460
00:20:54,747 --> 00:20:57,752
If you're bringing three tubes of toothpaste, I am bringing twelve books plus a dictionary.

461
00:20:57,895 --> 00:20:59,775
Then I'm bringing a gallon of mercury

462
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,305
which is one of the densest and heaviest substances known to man.

463
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,368
- I think the writing's on the wall here. 
- Cancel Europe.

464
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:06,435
I've gotta run. I love my graduation dress.

465
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:07,619
I know.

466
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,011
Hey, it's a shame about Europe being canceled, huh?

467
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,063
That's okay. It's not supposed to be that great anyway, except for the cheese.

468
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,818
- Nine books for two toothpastes. 
- Deal.

469
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,429
- Who is it, Emily? 
- I don't know, Richard.

470
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:23,390
My x-ray vision isn't working at the moment.

471
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,888
I was wondering if you were expecting somebody.

472
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,384
I wasn't expecting anybody.

473
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:31,121
- Rory. 
- Hey Grandma, hey Grandpa.

474
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,739
What brings you here on this busy day?

475
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:35,494
I have sort of a time-sensitive issue I need to talk to you about.

476
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:37,444
Time sensitive. Well, come in, come in.

477
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,041
We were just getting ready for your ceremony.

478
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,489
And I was just retying my tie for the third time.

479
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:48,627
No matter how many times I tie a tie, there's always room for error.

480
00:21:48,802 --> 00:21:50,255
It's not an exact science, is it?

481
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:52,566
Nor an art form. It's pretty much nothing.

482
00:21:52,693 --> 00:21:54,204
Sit down, please.

483
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:56,904
All right.

484
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:02,069
- Should we be nervous? 
- No, you shouldn't be. I am a little.

485
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:03,221
Well, what is it?

486
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:06,810
- I need money. 
- You need money.

487
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:08,679
- For Yale. 
- You need money for Yale.

488
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:11,766
- Stop repeating everything she says. 
- I'm sorry, I'm processing.

489
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:14,838
Look, it's a long story, but no other financing came through

490
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:18,407
and all of the other options that Mom and I have are just... well, not good enough.

491
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:22,443
So here's the offer - I would like for you to loan me the money for four years at Yale,

492
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,464
and in return I will get a part time job and pay you in installments.

493
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:28,010
I will continue this payment schedule after graduation

494
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:30,616
increasing the payment amounts in proportion to my income.

495
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:33,821
Plus, I will reinstate Friday night dinners with me.

496
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:36,477
Every Friday night, I will be here, seven o'clock on the dot.

497
00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:39,504
- Well, how wonderful. 
- We've missed you, Rory.

498
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:43,407
I've missed you, too. So this should work out for everyone, right?

499
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,254
Absolutely. We're happy to do it.

500
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:47,431
- Not so fast. 
- Richard.

501
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:50,958
Oh, I'm happy to pay for Yale, but I don't want it to be a loan.

502
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,460
No, I don't want that. I want it to be a loan, because otherwise it's too easy.

503
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,258
Well, then here's my counteroffer.

504
00:22:56,479 --> 00:23:00,206
Let's make it a loan, but I insist that you not start paying it back

505
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:02,434
until at least five years after you graduate.

506
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:04,635
Seven years if you go for your Master's.

507
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:06,708
That sounds fair, but I should pay interest.

508
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:07,769
- No. 
- Grandpa.

509
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,467
You are not going to pay me interest on this money, no way. That's a deal breaker.

510
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:15,925
- Okay. 
- Good.

511
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:18,823
- Wonderful. 
- We have a deal.

512
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:23,088
Listen, if journalism doesn't work out, you might consider working for me

513
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,647
after you graduate. You've got good deal-making skills. Eye of the tiger.

514
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:27,839
I'll keep that in mind.

515
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,456
- I should go. 
- Rory, does your mother know you're here?

516
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,517
This is my thing.

517
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:36,565
I'll see you at the ceremony.

518
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,255
Where do you wanna sit?

519
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,778
Is there no special designated area for family and friends of the valedictorian?

520
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:57,773
Like a skybox or a velvet rope on one of the rows.

521
00:23:57,845 --> 00:24:00,400
We're the Chilton equivalent of 50 Cent's posse. Where are the boys?

522
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:01,517
Over there.

523
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:06,102
They're doing that thing guys do around fancy buildings.

524
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:08,617
- Talk about their construction. 
- The insurance costs.

525
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:10,900
Hey guys, get over here.

526
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:13,811
Here's a row. Let me see, how many seats do we need?

527
00:24:13,981 --> 00:24:16,265
- You, me, Luke, Jackson. 
- That's four.

528
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,507
- Plus Picklepuss and Sauerkraut. 
- Your parents make six.

529
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:22,195
These stones have to be carved by hand.

530
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,146
Without the tools we have now. No electricity.

531
00:24:24,238 --> 00:24:27,198
- Just pulleys and fulcrums. 
- Hey, Bob Vila, take a seat.

532
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:30,398
Okay, we have to vow not to make fun of any of the kids

533
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:33,834
because inevitably their family will be sitting right behind us just like at the play.

534
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:38,743
Right. The big-eared Romeo fiasco of '98. Gotcha.

535
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,311
Who's paging you?

536
00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:43,090
Maybe there's a special surprise party

537
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,411
for the valedictorian's mom backstage before the ceremony.

538
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,397
- I bet there is. 
- I'll be right back.

539
00:24:48,482 --> 00:24:51,258
- Wow, look at the gargoyles. 
- What? Wow, yeah.

540
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:53,280
Oh, now those have to be imported from Europe.

541
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:56,941
The insurance on this place must be astronomical.

542
00:24:58,441 --> 00:25:01,233
Nanny, you brought the kids! Voc� trouxe as crian�as.

543
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:02,491
Paris!

544
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,521
Ah, minha queride Elzira, Catarina.

545
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,502
E olindo Enrique, Antonio Banderas.

546
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,679
Oh, excuse me. Hi, I'm looking for Rory Gilmore.

547
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:16,342
She's the valedictorian. I'm her mom.

548
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:18,291
- Mom. 
- No, wait, go away.

549
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:20,647
I wanna tell a bunch of other people that I'm the valedictorian's mom

550
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,591
and I'm looking for you.

551
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:23,515
I've got good news I wanna tell you real quick. Come here.

552
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,545
- Okay, you ready? 
- I hope so, ready for what?

553
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:30,571
- You're getting your inn. 
- What?

554
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,088
Go put in the bid on the Dragonfly.

555
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:34,144
You've got the money now, Grandpa's money.

556
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:35,743
What are you talking about? How do I have money?

557
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,612
Grandma and Grandpa are paying for Yale.

558
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:39,297
- Now wait a minute. 
- I explained the situation,

559
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:41,599
they totally understand, and they're loaning me the money for Yale.

560
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:42,907
When did they approach you about this?

561
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:44,781
- They didn't. I approached them. 
- No.

562
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,428
I just left them now. It's a done deal,

563
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:49,339
so go make the call, put in the bid, before someone else does.

564
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:52,720
Rory, honey, do you understand, the Gilmores do nothing altruistically.

565
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:54,563
Strings are attached to everything.

566
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,596
- There are no strings. 
- No strings?

567
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,207
No. I just have to pay them back starting five years after I graduate,

568
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:01,082
and I have to start going back for Friday night dinners.

569
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:03,139
Hello, Pinocchio, those are strings.

570
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:06,929
But it was my idea to resume the dinners, and I obligated just me.

571
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:09,074
- You are in no way apart of it. 
- This can't happen, Rory.

572
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:10,913
I don't want you to defer your dream.

573
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,444
You shouldn't have done this behind my back.

574
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:15,449
Mom, Yale is my thing. I needed financing, I got it.

575
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:17,999
Oh, those people, those master manipulators.

576
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:20,370
Mom, this was my idea. I'm manipulating you.

577
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:22,495
They are manipulating you to manipulate me.

578
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:24,625
- How are they doing that? 
- Rory, don't you see?

579
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,984
If you go to Friday night dinners, Mom knows I'll go to just to be with you.

580
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:30,937
- She wasn't thinking that. 
- They're getting exactly what they want.

581
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,467
Don't you see? We're all getting exactly what we want.

582
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:35,335
It's a win-win-win situation.

583
00:26:35,402 --> 00:26:36,494
- It's not. 
- It is.

584
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:38,515
Okay, maybe, maybe it is.

585
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:42,340
But just once, just once, I want you to get exactly what you want,

586
00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:45,454
and me to get exactly what I want, and them to get nothing.

587
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:47,419
Well, we'll see if we can't arrange that sometime.

588
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,601
But the ceremony's about to start, I better get back out there.

589
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:51,327
And go buy that inn!

590
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:03,379
Didn't you see Sookie? We've got seats all saved.

591
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:06,099
Yes, but we didn't know if the whole seating issue had been resolved.

592
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:07,174
It was. Come on.

593
00:27:07,282 --> 00:27:09,043
I don't remember it being fully resolved either.

594
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:10,051
It was. Come on.

595
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,598
We didn't know if you'd changed your mind.

596
00:27:11,684 --> 00:27:13,400
- I didn't. Come on. 
- It wasn't crystal clear.

597
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:16,304
- Fine, just stay there. 
- You're not serious.

598
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:29,268
Mom, Dad, you've met everyone here.

599
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:30,722
Sookie, Jackson, Luke.

600
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:34,118
- How ya doing? 
- No... Christopher?

601
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:36,951
No, he's out of town, but he's having us tons of pictures

602
00:27:37,064 --> 00:27:39,747
and order him the official video and we may even come back

603
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:42,794
and reenact the whole thing when he gets home. Now sit, relax.

604
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,970
Sookie, long story short, and a partially painful story at that,

605
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:52,133
and hang onto your hat, but we can now put a bid in on the Dragonfly.

606
00:27:52,446 --> 00:27:55,005
- What? Are you kidding? 
- No.

607
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:57,120
- How? What happened? 
- I can't go into it now.

608
00:27:57,305 --> 00:28:00,126
Okay, I've gotta tell you, even with the champagne and the Herb Albert,

609
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:02,558
I've been depressed for days. I couldn't watch the Dating Game anymore.

610
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,782
That's all changed now.

611
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:07,961
I'll go call the attorney. You sit back and relax and enjoy the graduation.

612
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,684
This will not happen again, promise.

613
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:21,176
You're gonna have to move over one more chair to be part of the group, guys.

614
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,095
Oh, I thought maybe someone else was coming.

615
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,869
No.

616
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:24,857
- You sure? 
- Yes.

617
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,745
Because if there is, it would be awkward to move during the ceremony.

618
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,220
Yes, I know what awkward is.

619
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,784
- What Mom? 
- Nothing.

620
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,525
That man in front of me is extraordinarily tall, don't you think?

621
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:56,470
The middle one, Catarina, she bowled a 143 last week.

622
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:57,228
Impressive.

623
00:28:57,438 --> 00:29:01,728
Sorry. I was here before a lot of you, it just looks like I'm late.

624
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,657
Appearances can be deceiving. So sorry.

625
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,418
Real estate agent wasn't in, so I left a message.

626
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:09,306
- Rats. 
- Did Rory walk in?

627
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:10,612
Yeah, first row.

628
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,863
Right in front of the kid with the humongous... the really cute kid.

629
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:19,307
Darn, I wanted to get a picture of her walking in. I'll get some of her in her seat.

630
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:24,699
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm not like this.

631
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:27,811
Today I am. I'm with the valedictorian, so...

632
00:29:28,962 --> 00:29:31,034
Invited guests, fellow faculty,

633
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,903
honored attendees and students,

634
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:38,840
welcome to the Chilton Academy graduating class ceremony of 2003.

635
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:44,537
This year's class is a distinguished assemblage,

636
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:47,492
equal to or surpassing what has proceeded it.

637
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:49,536
In its 200-year history,

638
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:54,154
Chilton has not failed to produce a class that brings only honor to these grounds

639
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:56,371
and to the academy's fine traditions.

640
00:29:56,607 --> 00:30:00,195
To begin, I would like to invite the student body president Paris Gellar

641
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,572
to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

642
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:03,919
Paris?

643
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,627
As his parting shot to me, Charleston never responded

644
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:10,313
to the three aspects of the pledge that I had an objection to and considered rewriting.

645
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:12,873
That's not going to stop me from using air quotes.

646
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:19,693
Through good times and bad, Chilton formed us,

647
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,638
brought us hope, honed our insight, gave us encouragement.

648
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,628
Though my time here was briefly interrupted by my period spent on Broadway

649
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,118
hanging out with Stephen Sondheim,

650
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:32,115
I still consider Chilton the most rewarding experience of my young life.

651
00:30:32,243 --> 00:30:35,617
Now it had always been my plan in closing to recite a short poem I'd written.

652
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:38,582
- But you reconsidered. 
- Come on, Brad. Go out a winner.

653
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:41,326
But as I read it aloud, I realized the sentiments I wanted to share

654
00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:44,168
with my fellow students were better expressed in a favorite song of mine.

655
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:50,808
Cherish is the word I use to describe...

656
00:30:50,903 --> 00:30:54,441
- Bong, bong. Bong, bong. 
- Oh, Brad.

657
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,973
All the feelings that I have hiding here for you inside, bong, bong, bong.

658
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:04,479
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you...

659
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:07,480
It's a distinct pleasure for me to introduce to you our valedictorian.

660
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:11,291
This young lady was a second-year transfer from a modest school

661
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,492
where she distinguished herself immeasurably.

662
00:31:13,603 --> 00:31:17,382
She is humble, hard working, competitive when need be,

663
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:20,188
and unparalleled in her academic achievements.

664
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:23,276
Ladies and Gentlemen, Rory Gilmore.

665
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,373
- Not crying, right? 
- Not crying.

666
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:36,630
Keeping our cool so we don't miss anything.

667
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,191
- Tears get in your eyes. 
- Then you miss things.

668
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,783
- So we're not crying. 
- Not crying.

669
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:42,570
- Not crying. 
- Not crying.

670
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,509
- Not crying. 
- What?

671
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,599
- No crying. 
- I'm not crying.

672
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:48,827
Headmaster Charleston, faculty members,

673
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:51,724
fellow students, family and friends, welcome.

674
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,619
We never thought this day would come.

675
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:57,608
We prayed for its quick delivery, crossed days off our calendars,

676
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:00,511
counted hours, minutes, and seconds, and now that it's here,

677
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:03,844
I'm sorry it is because it means leaving friends who inspire me

678
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:05,365
and teachers who have been my mentors -

679
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:07,331
so many people who have shaped my life

680
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:09,943
and my fellow students' lives impermeably and forever.

681
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:13,782
I live in two worlds. One is a world of books.

682
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:17,198
I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County,

683
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:20,582
hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon,

684
00:32:20,716 --> 00:32:24,949
sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly,

685
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,968
rode a sad train with Anna Karenina,

686
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:28,893
and strolled down Swann's Way.

687
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:32,969
It's a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior.

688
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:37,397
My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric but supremely real,

689
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:41,904
made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything.

690
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:47,229
Richard and Emily Gilmore are kind, decent, unfailingly generous people.

691
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,270
They are my twin pillars without whom I could not stand.

692
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:52,395
I am proud to be their grandchild.

693
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:55,944
But my ultimate inspiration comes from my best friend,

694
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:58,606
the dazzling woman from whom I received my name

695
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:01,064
and my life's blood, Lorelai Gilmore.

696
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:03,618
Hang in there.

697
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:06,481
My mother never gave me any idea that I couldn't do whatever

698
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:08,949
I wanted to do or be whomever I wanted to be.

699
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,801
She filled our house with love and fun and books and music,

700
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,935
unflagging in her efforts to give me role models

701
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:18,003
from Jane Austen to Eudora Welty to Patti Smith.

702
00:33:18,436 --> 00:33:21,576
As she guided me through these incredible eighteen years,

703
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,508
I don't know if she ever realized that the person I most wanted to be was her.

704
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:28,310
- Not crying. 
- Crying a little.

705
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,286
Crying a little, but not blubbering.

706
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:32,902
That's what we meant when we said no crying, no blubbering.

707
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:36,195
Thank you, Mom. You are my guidepost for everything.

708
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,345
On the verge of blubbering here.

709
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:39,856
Not doing too well myself.

710
00:33:40,592 --> 00:33:42,231
Not you, too.

711
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:44,352
I'm blubbering, you're freaks.

712
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:47,080
As we prepare ourselves today to leave...

713
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,585
Allegra Grace Fass.

714
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,645
I swear, I do not recognize half of these people.

715
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,205
Hey. What's your name, what's your story?

716
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:56,956
- Where is she, do you see her? 
- She's the one in the robe.

717
00:33:57,106 --> 00:33:57,889
Lorelai, please.

718
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,255
She's lost in a sea of blue polyester, Mom.

719
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:01,524
I couldn't point her out if I wanted to.

720
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:03,710
Richard, how much to insure all this?

721
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:05,586
The insurance is probably not prohibitive,

722
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:08,453
but the deductibles would be enormous. Well into six figures.

723
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:09,774
Six figures?

724
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,119
- That's like having no insurance at all. 
- So if there was a fire...

725
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:15,745
Guys, please stop assessing the value of the building and pay attention.

726
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:17,286
- Rory's coming up. 
- Ooh, ooh, sorry.

727
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:19,482
I wanna get a closer shot of her getting her diploma.

728
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:22,702
Ooh, sorry, sorry,

729
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:25,437
I suck, I'm sorry.

730
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:30,507
- Paris Eustace Gellar. 
- Finally, a name I recognize.

731
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,624
- Congratulations, Paris. 
- No hard feelings.

732
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,787
- Lorelai Leigh Gilmore. 
- This is it.

733
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:47,756
- She looks so solemn. 
- Like a Gilmore.

734
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:52,263
- Congratulations, Rory. 
- Thank you, Headmaster.

735
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,683
Diana Christine Godby.

736
00:34:57,901 --> 00:35:00,348
- Lorelai, really. 
- I taught her everything I know.

737
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:03,285
Honest to God, last time. Sorry.

738
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:13,996
Oh my God. I need a pen. I don't have a pen. Luke, give me your pen.

739
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:16,233
- I don't have a pen. 
- Where's the pen you take orders with?

740
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:19,475
You have got to stop assuming that I take pens with me everywhere I go.

741
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,593
- Never be without a pen. 
- Thank you, Dad.

742
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:35,535
Really, Lorelai, how many more times are you gonna do that?

743
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:36,780
I think about six.

744
00:35:39,244 --> 00:35:42,182
Class of 2003, give yourself a hand!

745
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:51,050
How was my speech?

746
00:35:52,123 --> 00:35:55,196
It made everyone cry, including stone cold Luke.

747
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:58,197
- Luke, you old softy. 
- I will never live this down.

748
00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:00,799
- Not with me in your life. 
- I gotta go, I gotta get back to the diner.

749
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:03,870
- Thanks for coming, Luke. 
- Oh, sure. The building's amazing.

750
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:07,700
- So are you. 
- Thanks.

751
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:14,270
It really was great of you to come, Luke. It meant a lot to her.

752
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:14,966
It was fun.

753
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:20,582
So if I don't see you, have fun on your trip with Nicole.

754
00:36:21,074 --> 00:36:22,343
Oh, we may not go now.

755
00:36:22,544 --> 00:36:24,044
What? You were really looking forward to it.

756
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:27,746
I don't know if the timing's right and... things are kinda weird right now.

757
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:29,445
- Oh no. 
- What?

758
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,942
It's because I teased you about the commitment thing and proposing. I ruined it.

759
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:33,845
No, that's not it.

760
00:36:33,963 --> 00:36:36,067
Please, promise me that's not it. It would break my heart.

761
00:36:36,134 --> 00:36:37,669
But you weren't wrong about that.

762
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:41,284
It got me thinking and it is kind of like committing to her.

763
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,567
- So? 
- I don't wanna lead her on.

764
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:46,823
But you like her, Luke. You like her a lot, don't you?

765
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:48,625
- Yeah, she's great. 
- Then go.

766
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:50,591
No matter what she's reading into it.

767
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:53,166
Really? You think that's okay considering...

768
00:36:53,991 --> 00:36:55,998
I don't know... everything?

769
00:36:57,764 --> 00:36:59,352
Yeah, I do.

770
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:02,707
Oh, okay. I'll probably go then.

771
00:37:02,825 --> 00:37:03,346
Good.

772
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,215
I guess I was just nervous about nothing.

773
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:06,721
That's what I think, too.

774
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:10,504
- I'll see ya in a couple months. 
- Yeah, I'll see you then.

775
00:37:18,092 --> 00:37:20,048
I guess we should say our goodbyes.

776
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:23,126
Nanny made me a special dinner. She makes a mean farturas.

777
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:25,890
Well, good, I'm glad you found me. I wanted to say goodbye, too.

778
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:27,980
Good. Well, good luck.

779
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,320
You know, it's weird,

780
00:37:31,355 --> 00:37:35,406
- most of the time I really hated you. 
- Yeah, I really hated you, too.

781
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:48,062
Well, I think it might be time to present Rory with her graduation gift.

782
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:50,044
Oh, you guys didn't have to get me anything.

783
00:37:50,244 --> 00:37:50,981
Nonsense.

784
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:54,362
This one wouldn't fit in an envelope, so follow me please.

785
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:56,404
We're really excited about this one.

786
00:37:56,604 --> 00:37:57,326
So am I.

787
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:58,284
Good.

788
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:02,804
Rory, there is your gift. It's the one with the bow.

789
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,954
- Grandpa. 
- Richard.

790
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:10,356
Oh, for Pete's sake. Well, it was the only one there when I drove it up.

791
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,651
You should've put a more distinctive bow on it.

792
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:15,329
Well, how was I supposed to know that every kid at Chilton was getting a car?

793
00:38:15,447 --> 00:38:18,212
- You got me a car? 
- We got you a car.

794
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:21,750
That's amazing. Thank you.

795
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:25,093
Thank you. Which one is it?

796
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:27,474
Or did you get her one for every day of the week like the underwear?

797
00:38:27,622 --> 00:38:32,216
We got her one car. It's a little Prius. It's safe, it gets great gas mileage.

798
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,557
And it's the one that Leonardo DiCaprio drives.

799
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:37,920
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you guys.

800
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:40,408
- We love you, too. 
- And don't forget to call about...

801
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,339
Insurance. I'll do it the second I get home.

802
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:44,607
Good. Congratulations, Rory.

803
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:47,224
And thank you for your speech.

804
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:49,768
You're welcome. I meant it, thank you for everything.

805
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:50,746
Have fun in Europe.

806
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:52,999
- Both of you. 
- Thank you, Mom.

807
00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:54,960
- When do you get back? 
- The 27th.

808
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,458
Terrific. We'll see you that Friday for dinner.

809
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:02,979
Explain the win-win-win thing again.

810
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,657
Everybody wins, that's what it is.

811
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:15,294
- A hang up? 
- Yeah.

812
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:16,850
You're getting a lot of those lately.

813
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:29,572
Jess, is that you?

814
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,694
Jess, I'm pretty sure it's you and I'm pretty sure you've been calling

815
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,027
and not saying anything but wanna say something. Hello?

816
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,313
You're not going to talk? Fine, I'll talk.

817
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,723
You didn't handle things right at all. You could've talked to me.

818
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:47,047
You could've told me that you were having trouble in school

819
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,618
and weren't going to graduate, and that your dad had been there,

820
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,322
but you didn't. And you ended up not taking me to my prom

821
00:39:52,419 --> 00:39:56,582
and not coming to my graduation and leaving again without saying goodbye again,

822
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,859
and that's fine, I get it, but that's it for me.

823
00:39:59,956 --> 00:40:03,099
I'm going to Europe tomorrow and I'm going to Yale and I'm moving on.

824
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:06,736
And I'm not going to pine. I hope you didn't think I was going to pine, okay?

825
00:40:07,298 --> 00:40:08,195
I think...

826
00:40:10,478 --> 00:40:14,754
I think I may have loved you, but I just need to let it go.

827
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,820
So, that's it, I guess.

828
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:26,975
I hope you're good. I want you to be good, and...

829
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,152
Okay, so, goodbye.

830
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:33,725
That word sounds really lame and stupid right now, but there it is.

831
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:34,821
Goodbye.

832
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:55,189
Hey. You okay?

833
00:40:55,726 --> 00:40:56,321
I'm okay.

834
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,713
Come on.

835
00:40:57,974 --> 00:40:59,531
But Sookie and Jackson are out that way.

836
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:01,246
I wanna go back a different way, come on.

837
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:03,719
I thought we were going home.

838
00:41:04,123 --> 00:41:05,767
I just wanna make one more stop before we do.

839
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,489
- Hey, Luke. 
- Lorelai, hi. Where's Rory?

840
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:15,537
Oh, out in the car.

841
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:18,092
Oh. It was a really nice ceremony, wasn't it?

842
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:19,946
Yeah, it was beautiful.

843
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:21,830
What's up?

844
00:41:22,536 --> 00:41:26,104
I just wanted to say something to you in case

845
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:28,010
we don't see each other before you go on your trip.

846
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:29,357
Sure, what?

847
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,670
Don't get engaged.

848
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:35,716
What, why?

849
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:40,427
Lorelai?

850
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:55,455
- Mom, wait. 
- Hurry, hurry.

851
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:58,204
This outfit produces a lot of wind resistance.

852
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,973
- What are we doing? 
- Leaving our mark. Got a knife?

853
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:03,336
A knife? For what?

854
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:04,852
Carving our initials. Come on, knife, knife.

855
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:07,632
Like the switchblade I keep in my sock? No, I left it at home.

856
00:42:07,797 --> 00:42:09,465
I must have something in here.

857
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,999
- Ah, safety pin, perfect. 
- We can't do this.

858
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:17,064
Yes, we can. People need to know we were here.

859
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,773
- I'm in the yearbook. 
- How about the wall?

860
00:42:20,182 --> 00:42:22,246
No, that's too out in the open. They'll trace it back to us.

861
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:24,530
They'll see LG and RG and figure out it was us?

862
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:26,696
- They're are no dorks here. 
- Somewhere in the floor?

863
00:42:26,865 --> 00:42:29,936
This marble is two hundred years old. Harriet Beecher Stowe walked on this marble.

864
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:33,326
The banister.

865
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:35,579
Was donated by Robert Frost.

866
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:37,336
The sconce.

867
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:40,106
Was ceremonially lit for the first time by Thomas Edison.

868
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,646
Geez, is there anything in this whole room

869
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:44,909
that some famous dead person didn't have something to do with.

870
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:49,286
Cool it, cool it. And this is some very interesting architectural do-dads and hoo-ha's.

871
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:51,949
- And wingdings and tum-tum's. 
- That was close.

872
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:56,039
Look, just carve it really tiny here on the baseboard of the wall,

873
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:59,365
and do it reversed, so GL and GR.

874
00:43:00,282 --> 00:43:02,049
Oh, maybe it's not such a good idea.

875
00:43:02,403 --> 00:43:03,355
The madness passes.

876
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,918
Hey, you guys coming? Party at your place, right?

877
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:08,455
- Party? 
- Just a little gathering.

878
00:43:08,557 --> 00:43:09,223
Cool.

879
00:43:09,357 --> 00:43:10,391
We'll meet you back at our house.

880
00:43:10,636 --> 00:43:11,481
Okay, see you there.

881
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:13,627
Wait, wait.

882
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:16,509
Look around for a second.

883
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:19,796
Notice?

884
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:21,276
Notice what?

885
00:43:22,848 --> 00:43:24,052
It's not so scary anymore.

886
00:43:26,444 --> 00:43:27,993
No, it's not.

887
