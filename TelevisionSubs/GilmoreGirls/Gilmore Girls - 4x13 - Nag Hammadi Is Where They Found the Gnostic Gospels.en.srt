1
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:44,403
Cold, cold, cold, cold !

2
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,337
Icy feet, stupid frozen-tundra house!

3
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:52,182
Honey, why are you sleeping in here? Your room is way warmer.

4
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:56,640
Okay, here's the question for today, kids.

5
00:00:57,184 --> 00:00:58,795
What the hell are the Eskimos thinking?

6
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:01,515
I mean, yes, the hoods are cute, but it's always cold. Always!

7
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:04,925
Plus you have to eat fish for breakfast and you have to eat whales

8
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:07,602
and then polar bears and penguins

9
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,188
and Santa Claus...

10
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:14,627
Okay, coffee's on, Pop-Tarts are pop-tarting!

11
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:17,673
If you're just going to lie there, I'm going to have to sit here.

12
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:20,787
I'm going to make myself very comfortable on a nice, warm Rory!

13
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,235
Why is it so cold in here?

14
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:24,596
I thought I was sitting on you!

15
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,069
Oh, really? Good trick...

16
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:28,098
Well, if you are there, then who is this?

17
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:28,983
I don't know.

18
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:30,299
We've got a stranger in our house.

19
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:32,070
- Robert Downey, Jr? 
- Or a murderer.

20
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,058
... who needed to take a nap before committing his crimes?

21
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:36,909
I think this belongs to you.

22
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:38,486
She must have followed me home from Yale.

23
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:40,268
I told her she could hang out there this weekend.

24
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,712
But why do that when you can come here

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,150
and sleep where penguins need a coat?

26
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:44,747
Yeah, why is it so cold in here?

27
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:47,323
I broke that stupid window trying to lock it last night.

28
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:48,558
Well, get it fixed, woman.

29
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,472
I left Luke a message just now. He'll do it.

30
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:52,489
Before or after the re-enactment of Alive?

31
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,758
- Hopefully before. 
- Why don't you call a guy?

32
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,673
- What guy? 
- A window fixing guy.

33
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,437
Ah, Luke always gets mad when I pay someone

34
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:01,464
to do something that he could do for free.

35
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:05,719
And then he lectures me about it every time I see him and it's annoying.

36
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,258
"Oh, you paid him how much to fix the window?

37
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:12,335
What, you couldn't just find someone to steal your purse that day?

38
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:14,598
Hey, while you're at it I've got an idea,

39
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,133
why don't you go down to a Versateller and let them charge you five bucks

40
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,077
to take your own money out of the bank?

41
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:22,349
Or buy some tickets at Ticketmaster and wind up paying more in service charges

42
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:24,260
than it would cost you to see the band?

43
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:27,346
Oh, here's a great fifty buck mark up on a bottle of wine

44
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,660
that it would have cost you ten dollars in the supermarket you're missing!"

45
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:31,300
Oh my God, Luke is annoying.

46
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:35,119
So…

47
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:36,685
What?

48
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:39,998
Just wondering what you're thinking about.

49
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,410
I'm thinking about nothing.

50
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,581
Nothing wouldn't happen to wear a leather jacket

51
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:46,782
and be able to pull off an extremely convincing

52
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:49,434
- "Adrian!" would it? 
- No, it wouldn't.

53
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:52,245
You think he froze to death?

54
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,667
- No, He wasn't sleeping here. 
- Right.

55
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:56,225
I'm sure Luke took care of it.

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,362
Hey, did somebody sit on me just now?

57
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,047
- No, why? 
- My hip hurts.

58
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:02,685
Oh, getting old...

59
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:08,809
Hey, did anyone ever think that maybe Sylvia Plath wasn't crazy,

60
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:10,079
she was just cold?

61
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:35,618
Come on guys, push harder.

62
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:38,578
We need more stars in the gazebo area.

63
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,004
I repeat: we need more stars in the gazebo area.

64
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,371
Do you copy? Roger.

65
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,475
I'm supposed to say roger, Kirk.

66
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:48,291
I don't think so. Copy. Roger.

67
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:51,261
Roger means I heard you, Kirk. I was supposed to say roger.

68
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:54,982
Negative. I am in charge here and I say roger! ROGER.

69
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,966
No, you don't.

70
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:57,492
Just let him say roger, Joe.

71
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,391
If he says roger, what the hell am I supposed to say?

72
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:00,257
Who cares?

73
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,200
- Get out of the way, Kirk. 
- Hold on. Roger.

74
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:04,456
This car is not stopping.

75
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:07,578
I am planning the Firelight Festival. Taylor left me in charge,

76
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,161
and I have to make sure everything is perfect.

77
00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:10,170
- Move! 
- Roger.

78
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,211
Shouldn't you have a marching band behind you?

79
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:14,060
Go away.

80
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,976
The Budweiser Clydesdales prancing along, Ann Jillian waving in the back.

81
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,080
I've got to get my car to Gypsy so she can fix it and I can leave.

82
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:22,790
So you decided to push it there.

83
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:23,795
I didn't have a choice.

84
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:25,059
Just push this piece of junk out of my way!

85
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,814
I'm going as fast as I can, jerk!

86
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:29,568
Jess, do you at all find this ridiculous?

87
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:33,220
Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I do find this ridiculous.

88
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:38,084
I find it ridiculous that Gypsy won't walk twenty feet to take a look at my car.

89
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:39,358
Hire a tow truck.

90
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,381
It costs eighty bucks to hire a tow truck.

91
00:05:41,663 --> 00:05:44,407
Oh, come on, it's like freakin' Carnivale out here.

92
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,635
- I'll give you the eighty bucks. 
- No.

93
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:48,774
- You're blocking the whole street. 
- I don't want your money.

94
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,669
You wanna get out of here, let me pay the eighty bucks.

95
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:51,734
I'll pitch in ten.

96
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,463
Hey, how about more walkie, and less talkie.

97
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:56,123
You're making a spectacle of yourself.

98
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:58,605
Go home, you won't have to watch.

99
00:05:59,035 --> 00:05:59,613
Fine.

100
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:05,891
- Well? 
- Still looking.

101
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,628
- What's the matter with it? 
- Still looking.

102
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,704
You've been circling around the thing for fifteen minutes.

103
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,789
You waiting for it to tell you where it hurts?

104
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,181
I've seen dumber things talk.

105
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,158
Just tell me what's wrong with the car.

106
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:16,510
You need a carburetor.

107
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:18,956
- So how long until it's fixed? 
- Not sure.

108
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:20,878
It has to be today.

109
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:24,677
I have to walk out of this half-mile, four-block, freakhole of a medical experiment.

110
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:25,895
You are delightful.

111
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:29,986
I'll have you out of here tonight. Go away and come back at closing.

112
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:30,656
Fine.

113
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,561
And bring a lot of money because I'm going to overcharge you

114
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,209
like you've never been overcharged before.

115
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:35,668
I'll bet you say that to all the guys.

116
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,712
On second thought, maybe I'm closing early tonight.

117
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,551
I'm going.

118
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:42,309
That's not her.

119
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:44,158
What?

120
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:45,484
She cut her hair.

121
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:46,809
Don't know what you're talking about.

122
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,571
Okay, my mistake.

123
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:57,163
Okay, now. Hold it.

124
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:01,188
Oh, okay, how does it look?

125
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,236
Festive and femme.

126
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:03,825
Yes, and completely ineffective.

127
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:05,330
Maybe it just needs another layer.

128
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:06,354
Yes, of glass.

129
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,679
Nice. Something to protect us from freezer burn.

130
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:09,773
Come over here and help us.

131
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:11,546
I'm not going to help you Barbie Band-aid our window.

132
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:16,076
I will, however, help you to call one of the many extremely qualified window repairmen

133
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:17,587
that I've circled for you in the phone book.

134
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:19,718
Hey, if we fix the window before Luke comes over,

135
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,596
he will have his feelings hurt. Do you want that?

136
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:23,495
- Phone book's on the kitchen table. 
- Where are you going?

137
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:26,204
I'm going to take a walk, get a Danish, hit the bookstore,

138
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:27,715
- and I'll be back for lunch. 
- Okay.

139
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:29,951
Maybe if we add a layer of tinfoil.

140
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,927
Hey, professional window guys are driving by,

141
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:34,437
pointing and laughing. I just thought you should know.

142
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:35,277
Thank you.

143
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,383
So, listen, I have some errands to run today. Do you need anything?

144
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:40,494
No, I'm fine.

145
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,022
Okay. I'll probably be heading down Elm.

146
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,551
Well, that's a good street.

147
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,984
Yes, it is.

148
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,780
If there is anything you'd want me to do on Elm,

149
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:53,314
or anyone you wanted me to see, I could...

150
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:54,251
That's okay.

151
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:57,733
Has she said anything to you?

152
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,642
No, but she's wanted to.

153
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,831
How can you tell?

154
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:02,361
Let's just say it's a mom thing.

155
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,449
Yeah, well...

156
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:07,421
Okay, well maybe tomorrow then.

157
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,713
- Hello? 
- It's a complete disaster!

158
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:19,263
- My existence? 
- Not everything is about you, Lorelai.

159
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:20,113
Oh, sorry.

160
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:22,309
The rare manuscripts acquisition fundraiser is tonight

161
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:24,951
and we still haven't filled our table. I'm four people short.

162
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:27,061
The Burles are going to visit their daughter in New Hampshire.

163
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:29,697
Well then they can just go straight to hell, then, can't they?

164
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:31,602
Mom, I already said I'd go.

165
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,266
But we still have a half empty table.

166
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:35,442
Well, fewer people to fight over the centerpiece.

167
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:37,192
Stop it. This is not funny.

168
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,908
The last person who didn't fill her table was Loretta Bobbins.

169
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:41,273
Do you remember Loretta Bobbins?

170
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:42,544
- No. 
- Exactly!

171
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,361
Once you do not fill your table, you do not get another table to fill.

172
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:47,674
- You are off the list. 
- Mom, that's not gonna happen to you.

173
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,677
- You said you would come. 
- I am coming.

174
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,894
And you're bringing someone.

175
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:52,118
I never said I was bringing someone.

176
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,638
- I'm telling you to now. 
- Mom, it's tonight.

177
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,696
I need you to bring someone, Lorelai.

178
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:59,256
- But I… 
- Loretta Bobbins, Lorelai.

179
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:02,154
All right, the Dartmores are trying to change Bitty's viewing.

180
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,342
They'll call back in a minute.

181
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,554
They owe us, Richard. Remind them that they owe us.

182
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:08,857
All right. I'll see you tonight at six o'clock sharp

183
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:11,118
and don't wear those pantyhose with the seams up the back.

184
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:12,420
You look like ten cents a dance.

185
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,435
Richard, I need a gimlet.

186
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:19,471
After we light the bonfire, the dancers should come through.

187
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:20,478
Okay, Kirk.

188
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:24,272
They'll circle the gazebo. Jazz hands, jazz hands, jazz hands.

189
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:25,783
Then out come the flaming batons.

190
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:26,980
That sounds good, Kirk.

191
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,303
Are you ignoring me?

192
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:30,651
Since you were old enough to walk, Kirk.

193
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:32,035
- What do you think? 
- I think it's good.

194
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:33,205
Is there too much turquoise?

195
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:35,056
Are you kidding? Turquoise is timeless.

196
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:36,791
What are you doing?

197
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:40,047
Oh, hey, Luke. You remember my friend Carrie, right?

198
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:41,799
Oh, yeah. Hey, Carrie.

199
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:45,342
Hi, Butch, good to see you. Been under any bleachers lately?

200
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:47,174
No, I haven't.

201
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:49,806
- What is that? 
- It's an earring tree.

202
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:52,253
- And what is it for? 
- You hang earrings on it.

203
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:53,287
And what is it doing here?

204
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,900
I thought I'd put some of my earrings out,

205
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:57,598
you know, and see if I could sell some to the good people of Stars Hollow.

206
00:09:57,748 --> 00:09:58,557
- No. 
- Why?

207
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,071
- They're cute. 
- This is a diner.

208
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:02,688
- People come here to eat, not shop. 
- But now they can do both.

209
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:05,167
Hey, Liz, can I talk to you for a moment?

210
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,455
Liz, you want me to negotiate with him for you?

211
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:09,795
No, she doesn't, Carrie. Thanks for the offer. Liz, please?

212
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:11,284
Sure, my brother.

213
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:14,418
Why are you so stressed about this?

214
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:17,357
Liz, do you remember when you decided to make those ceramic pots?

215
00:10:17,474 --> 00:10:18,657
Without a kiln?

216
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,321
- And how did that go? 
- Pretty bad.

217
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:22,303
You were depressed for a month, you cut all your hair,

218
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,082
- you threw out all your clothes... 
- I remember the bad times.

219
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:28,432
You put those earring out on my counter and nobody buys them…

220
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:30,470
They sell great at the fairs.

221
00:10:30,607 --> 00:10:33,419
I'm sure they do, but this is not a renaissance fair.

222
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:35,773
Look around. Everybody here has a life.

223
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:38,242
No one's gonna buy them. Please, just...

224
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:41,749
Oh, look at this. Oh, these are so cute!

225
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,002
- Luke, are you selling these? 
- He sure is.

226
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:46,572
- I'll take 'em. 
- Excuse me, I wanted those.

227
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:49,142
Turquoise? With your complexion?

228
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:51,052
They're for Lulu. She's a sweetheart.

229
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,594
Does she have pierced ears?

230
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,052
I can check.

231
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:57,283
Joe, have you ever noticed my girlfriend's lobes?

232
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:58,333
What?

233
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:01,010
Okay, thank you both for the show of support.

234
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,362
It's very kind but you don't have to do this.

235
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,235
Do what?

236
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:06,249
Pretend that you like them because Liz made them.

237
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:08,767
- Who's pretending? 
- Yeah, they're phat.

238
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,846
- They're gonna fall apart. 
- No they're not.

239
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,680
They're gonna make people's ears green and send them to the hospital.

240
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:14,517
You cannot design my ad campaign.

241
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,499
- Liz! 
- You need to nap, Jack.

242
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,859
I'm cool, they're cool, everybody's cool.

243
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:21,169
- Stop, Kirk! 
- Ouch! She slapped me!

244
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,700
- Who saw her slap me? 
- Okay, relax you two.

245
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,200
I can make you whatever you want!

246
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,745
I want these ones in fuchsia pink. I want these in purple...

247
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,753
Hi, I'd like a large coffee and a cherry Danish, please.

248
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:41,449
I'm leaving.

249
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,592
- A little farther back. Roger. 
- What?

250
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:54,146
It's gotta go back farther. Roger.

251
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,395
I can't hear you.

252
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:58,273
Speak into to your walkie-talkie. Roger.

253
00:11:58,448 --> 00:11:59,840
Kirk, what are you saying?

254
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:02,317
Speak into your...

255
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:05,140
Speak into your walkie-talkie! Roger!

256
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:08,067
I lost my walkie-talkie. I told you that.

257
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,341
Then it's your own fault! Roger!

258
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:14,575
Hey, Luke, hey Luke, hold on!

259
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,857
Please, I know you owe us nothing but our dead frozen carcasses

260
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:19,967
may someday haunt you in your old age, or not...

261
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,098
because you don't know who I am.

262
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:22,547
Hi. Sorry. I thought you were Luke.

263
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:25,722
- I should put on some lipstick. 
- No, I just saw the truck.

264
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:27,523
I borrowed the truck.

265
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:28,717
- Right. 
- He knows.

266
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:30,898
- I'm sure he does. 
- I'm Liz, Luke's sister.

267
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:34,472
Oh, Luke's sister, yeah, I knew you were here.

268
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:36,770
Hi, I'm Lorelai. So, is Luke in the diner?

269
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,245
No, he just stepped out for a sec. You need him for something?

270
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:40,637
I just needed to tell him something, I...

271
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:42,064
You want me to give him a message?

272
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:43,884
Sure, yeah...

273
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,627
tell him Lorelai wanted to gently remind him about the window.

274
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:48,813
I'll be home until five-thirty and tell him I looked cold.

275
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:52,168
- Oh, you're the wife. 
- The wife?

276
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,764
Yeah, I knew he got married, but I hadn't seen the face yet.

277
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:57,435
So, oh wow, it's good to meet you.

278
00:12:57,691 --> 00:12:59,714
No, no, no. I'm not the wife.

279
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:03,733
I'm the friend and the customer, not the wife.

280
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:06,616
Oh, sorry. You look like his type, so…

281
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,876
No, no, not his type or his wife,

282
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,004
just his friend. And his customer.

283
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:12,202
Still good to meet you.

284
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:14,092
You too. Luke has told me a lot about you.

285
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:16,979
- Yeah, like what? 
- Oh, like you're his sister…

286
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:17,942
He admits it!

287
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:20,434
And that, you know, you're here visiting him,

288
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:23,056
and how happy he is that you're visiting him.

289
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,044
- He did not say that. 
- I think he did.

290
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:28,397
He's not probably too thrilled I'm here. I'm kind of pain in his ass.

291
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,198
- Aren't we all? 
- Yeah, but I'm special.

292
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:35,545
I kinda screw up a lot and then he has to fix it and then we fight

293
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:38,176
and then I screw up again and he fixes it - it's a pattern.

294
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:40,065
Luke likes his routine.

295
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,667
He's pretty amazing though. No matter how much I screw up,

296
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:46,112
he just keeps fixing it. I need money, he gives me money.

297
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,920
No place to live, Luke finds an apartment.

298
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,285
Even my kid when I was having trouble with him...

299
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,517
- Did you ever meet Jess? 
- Oh yes, I did.

300
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:54,991
I tell you, he was hell on wheels.

301
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:58,056
I couldn't do a thing with him. I didn't know what to do, so...

302
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,751
- Luke fixed it? 
- He tried.

303
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:02,528
He wasn't entirely successful.

304
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,607
I don't know, maybe if I had sent Jess to him a little sooner…

305
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:11,082
Anyhow, Luke did what he could. He always does.

306
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,915
He's like my hero, you know.

307
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:16,459
Like one of those Greek gods with the golden helmets

308
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:18,327
and the shields and the sandals.

309
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:20,774
- And the little white toga dresses. 
- I sound silly.

310
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:21,972
No, you don't.

311
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:24,671
Take it from someone who's run to Luke many a time.

312
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,417
He's definitely one of the good ones.

313
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:29,275
Maybe THE good one.

314
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:33,632
Yeah, I miss him. I've even been thinking of moving back here.

315
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,388
- To Stars Hollow? 
- Maybe.

316
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:39,949
I've discussed it with my boyfriend. I'm not sure how Luke would like it, but I sure would.

317
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:41,905
I should get going.

318
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,129
Sure.

319
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,283
It was nice to meet you, friend and customer, not wife.

320
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:47,732
Nice to meet you too.

321
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:49,837
I'll be sure and give him your message.

322
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:51,296
Don't forget, human popsicle.

323
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,206
I have to tell you this is a real treat having you two girls over,

324
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:02,617
like spur of the moment, I don't know what I did to get so damned lucky.

325
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:05,294
We just realized we hadn't seen you very much lately

326
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,839
and we thought "Hey, today is the perfect day to catch up with Babette."

327
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:09,283
Oh, yeah, the perfect day.

328
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,163
Well I am tickled pink.

329
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:13,968
Here you go-- hot cocoa.

330
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:14,899
Thanks, Babette.

331
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:16,701
Ah, we don't deserve such treatment.

332
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,022
Of course you do...

333
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:22,318
two young hotsy-totsies like yourselves hanging out with an old bird like me.

334
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:23,993
You deserve a lot better.

335
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:27,834
So, you kids going to the Firelight Festival tonight?

336
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:28,591
You bet.

337
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:30,470
We're going to be late though because we have to make a pit stop

338
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:31,826
at one of my mother's charity events.

339
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,136
- Oh, sounds ritzy. 
- Like the cracker.

340
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:36,343
The festival should be quite a shindig.

341
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:40,495
Just watching Kirk trying to get those stars hung was worth the price of admission.

342
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:43,689
You know, he insisted on demonstrating the correct way to hang 'em

343
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:45,680
and treed himself. It took the fire department

344
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:47,915
and two cans of tuna to get him down.

345
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,209
I hate that I missed that.

346
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:52,264
Plus, the whole town is buzzing about Jess coming back.

347
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:56,618
Stupid little pisher, trying to sneak out of town without anyone knowing.

348
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:58,824
This town, what is he kidding?

349
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,245
Oh, I'm so sorry, sugar.

350
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,370
Here I am, going on and on about Jess.

351
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:05,849
It's fine, Babette. I'm fine.

352
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,370
- She's fine. 
- You sure?

353
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,524
- Yes. I'm sure. 
- She's fine.

354
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,846
- I saw him. 
- Who?

355
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:11,655
- Jess? 
- Yes.

356
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,597
- When? 
- Where?

357
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,246
- Today at Weston's. 
- He went into Weston's?

358
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,083
- That little bastard. 
- What happened?

359
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,024
I went in, he saw me and he left.

360
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:19,284
- No! 
- He said nothing?

361
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:22,418
No, he said something. He said, "I'm leaving."

362
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:24,240
Way to state the obvious.

363
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:27,041
It was so weird. I mean, he's the one who left town.

364
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:30,962
He's the one who didn't call and now he just gets up and walks out like he's mad.

365
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:32,033
What does he have to be mad about?

366
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:34,869
Exactly! I should be mad. It's my town.

367
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:36,836
I should be the one to walk out in a huff.

368
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,470
You still stuck on him, honey?

369
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:39,487
No, I'm not.

370
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:42,585
I just wasn't expecting him to come back, that's all.

371
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:43,614
He'll be gone soon.

372
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:45,535
Yeah, I know. He'll be gone soon.

373
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:47,885
Oh my God, I forgot the marshmallows!

374
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,472
He'll be gone soon.

375
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:52,472
Mayday! Mayday!

376
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,546
The Morrison kids have stolen the bonfire again!

377
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:57,838
I repeat: the kids have stolen the bonfire again! 

378
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,338
Cesar, I'm back.

379
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,581
What did you burn?

380
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:04,034
- Liz! 
- Luke, hi!

381
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,712
- What are you doing? 
- I just needed some things.

382
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,531
- Steaks? 
- Yeah.

383
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,274
You needed steaks?

384
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:09,133
I'm making dinner upstairs and you don't have anything.

385
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,034
Then go to a store.

386
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,594
Oh, come on, a couple of steaks. What's the big deal?

387
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:13,929
The big deal is, I run a diner.

388
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,869
I sell food, that's how I make my living. It's how I can afford all this.

389
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:19,086
Oh, you can spare a couple of things.

390
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:21,154
How do you know what I can spare? That's a whole pie.

391
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:22,839
It's a peach pie. Nobody eats the peach.

392
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:24,103
A lot of people eat the peach.

393
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:27,468
I'll buy a pie tomorrow. Tonight I'm making a feast for my guys.

394
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,520
Your guys? Who are your guys?

395
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,794
- You and T.J. 
- T. J.?

396
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,306
Yep, you're really gonna like him. He's upstairs right now waiting for us and he...

397
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:38,492
Upstairs in my apartment? You left some guy named T.J. alone in my apartment?

398
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,872
- Ah, Liz! 
- I've been gone twenty seconds.

399
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:42,889
- That's all it takes. 
- To do what?

400
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:44,835
Steal the singing "Be Happy" Bass?

401
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,519
Hey, that is my singing "Be Happy" Bass

402
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:48,845
and it had better still be up there, including the batteries.

403
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:54,194
Hey, I thought I'd make chili.

404
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:57,403
You are not Liz.

405
00:17:57,789 --> 00:17:59,259
Already smarter than the last guy.

406
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:03,154
Hi, baby. Look what I found downstairs.

407
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:04,900
You must be Luke.

408
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:06,559
I think she's talking about the steaks.

409
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,673
I was not talking about the steaks.

410
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:12,892
This is my "Him." This is my guy.

411
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:14,321
This is T.J.

412
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,054
- Guess what it stands for? 
- What?

413
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:19,190
- T.J. Guess what it stands for? 
- I don't know.

414
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:19,973
Just guess.

415
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:21,853
- I can't. 
- Come on.

416
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:25,088
- Thomas Jefferson? 
- No. Thomas Jefferson?

417
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:27,091
Wow, that's a weird guess.

418
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:28,580
Okay, you know, I've gotta go back.

419
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:31,488
Oh no, come on, Cesar's there, sit down.

420
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:32,323
You want a beer?

421
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,786
You mean one of my beers out of my fridge? Sure, why not.

422
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,835
Coming right up.

423
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:38,534
Oh, I'm so excited.

424
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:40,766
My two favorite guys are here with me,

425
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,126
drinking, talking…

426
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:44,775
And soon, there will be chili.

427
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:48,237
I forgot something.

428
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:51,252
Oh my God, this is freaky.

429
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,966
It's like fate. Jess didn't know we were here.

430
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:58,057
I had no idea that Jess would come by and now look at us together.

431
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:02,245
All the men in my life are drawn here to me.

432
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,905
This is positive. This means something. Do you feel it?

433
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,811
I sure do.

434
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,906
Baby, this is my kid.

435
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:09,889
This is Jess.

436
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:12,583
Jess, this is T.J.

437
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:14,266
- Guess what it stands for. 
- No.

438
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,361
Oh, you'll stay for dinner.

439
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:18,198
I've gotta go check on my car.

440
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:20,769
Come on, we're making a ton of food. There's beer.

441
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:22,208
- My beer. 
- I'm not hungry.

442
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,491
Oh please, stay for a little while.

443
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,503
I think you guys are really gonna get along great.

444
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:38,250
T.J. is really enjoying Stars Hollow. Aren't you, baby?

445
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:39,764
Oh yeah, this place is great.

446
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:42,320
- It reminds me of New York. 
- How?

447
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,227
- You know. 
- Neither one is in space.

448
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:47,358
- No, that's not it. 
- Of course not.

449
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:48,668
There's an energy, right?

450
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,765
There is. I feel it. A very similar energy.

451
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:55,682
Liz showed me your old house and your school.

452
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,178
Like the picture of you in the shorts.

453
00:19:57,439 --> 00:20:01,017
My brother was very big in athletics in his day.

454
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:03,532
And the ladies loved him.

455
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:05,610
Ask Carrie. They went out.

456
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,509
Crazy Carrie and I did not go out.

457
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,761
- They just made out. 
- We did not make out.

458
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:14,264
We did not go out. We did nothing that involved the word out.

459
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:15,932
I think he's still hung up on her.

460
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,201
- A lightening bolt, please. 
- I gotta go.

461
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,099
Oh, okay, but come back after you've checked your car.

462
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:24,376
We'll save you some food. You look good.

463
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:25,824
Handsome.

464
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,529
If I was some girl, I wouldn't kick him out of bed.

465
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,761
- Come back, okay? 
- Okay.

466
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:32,690
Yeah, if you do, I'll draw your portrait on my Etch-A-Sketch.

467
00:20:32,828 --> 00:20:33,863
Hey, can't miss that.

468
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:35,798
We'll see.

469
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:37,662
Hey, Jess wait a sec.

470
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,327
- So, wow. 
- Yep.

471
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,447
If I had to pick anyone in the world for my sister to be with,

472
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:49,372
that guy would definitely be his cab driver.

473
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:50,826
I don't know. He had a certain something.

474
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:53,058
- Yeah, lack of chromosomes. 
- That sounds right.

475
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:53,898
So, what do we do?

476
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:56,104
- About what? 
- About that, them, him.

477
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:56,842
Nothing.

478
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:59,227
- Where are you going? 
- To check on my car.

479
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:01,224
But Jess, don't you think that we should discuss this?

480
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:03,422
- Discuss what? 
- T.J.

481
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:05,675
- I thought we just did. 
- But we didn't come up with a solution.

482
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:08,085
- A solution to what? 
- Are we having the same conversation?

483
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:09,495
A solution to him.

484
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,437
A solution would have been birth control. Too late, move on.

485
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,993
Jess, we have to do something about this.

486
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:17,004
- Like what? 
- I don't know.

487
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:18,357
- We have to say something. 
- Like what?

488
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,067
He's a grown man with an Etch-A-Sketch!

489
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:22,268
So shake him real hard. Maybe he'll disappear.

490
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,845
Oh come on. What, do you like this guy?

491
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,128
Of course I don't like this guy. I don't like any of the guys,

492
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,260
but she's gonna do what she's gonna do.

493
00:21:28,377 --> 00:21:32,078
No, I do not accept that. We can go to Liz together. We can tell her...

494
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,758
She does not care what we think.

495
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:35,744
She really doesn't care what I think.

496
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:38,069
I've got nineteen years of proof to back me up.

497
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,548
Yes, she does. You just have to find the right angle with Liz.

498
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:42,779
- Can I go please? 
- No, you can't go.

499
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:47,731
We have to fix this. I cannot watch her throw her life away again with a loser again.

500
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:49,005
You see, this is your problem.

501
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,418
You're going to help people whether they want it or not.

502
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,367
You have to fix everything.

503
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,114
You have to fix everyone.

504
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:59,035
You think it makes you a good guy, but really, it just makes you a pain in the ass.

505
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:02,696
You make it so that when people fail you,

506
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,260
you get to feel like the martyr and they get to feel like not only did they screw up,

507
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,214
but they also disappointed you.

508
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,676
You interfere and you make everything worse.

509
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:13,787
No one is asking for your help.

510
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:15,660
No one wants your help.

511
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:18,026
Focus on your own life and leave everyone else alone.

512
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:29,398
Give it back! I mean it!

513
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,277
I'm in charge here guys! Come on!

514
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:34,093
Give it back! I need that!

515
00:22:35,705 --> 00:22:36,714
Hey, Andrew.

516
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:39,996
Can you track these down for me? They're all out of print.

517
00:22:40,103 --> 00:22:41,164
- You got it. 
- Thanks.

518
00:22:56,463 --> 00:22:57,010
Ow! Damn it.

519
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:57,884
Hello?

520
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:00,656
Oh, Luke.

521
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:01,971
Oh yeah. Hey.

522
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:03,429
How did you get in here?

523
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:04,987
You left your bedroom window open.

524
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:06,803
My bedroom window is on the second floor.

525
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:07,986
What did you do?

526
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:12,007
I promised to fix your window, so I'm here to fix your window.

527
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,594
Oh, my God, you cut yourself.

528
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,764
- Glass was broken. 
- Hence the need for fixing.

529
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:19,051
I'm sorry. Are you drunk?

530
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:22,149
I am not drunk. I do not get drunk.

531
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:25,768
I had some beer-beers. More than one.

532
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:29,083
A few. And then I came here and I climbed your tree.

533
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:31,632
- Well, good thinking. 
- And then I fell out of your tree.

534
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:32,677
Sit down.

535
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:35,492
I landed flat on my back. I felt like Kirk.

536
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:36,848
Hold your hand up in the air.

537
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:40,966
And then I climbed back up the tree. This time I made it.

538
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:43,761
I got in. Sorry about the lamp.

539
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:46,070
You know, Luke, you could have broken your neck.

540
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,224
You know, it would have been all right if I had.

541
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:50,495
I would have fixed it because that's what I do:

542
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:53,454
I fix things. Even when they don't want to be fixed.

543
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:55,593
- Let me see your hand. 
- Why?

544
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:59,065
Because it is bleeding and I need to look at it. Ew! Gross!

545
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:02,305
- It's fine, leave it. 
- I can't leave it, it's cut.

546
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:03,371
That's my wrist.

547
00:24:03,715 --> 00:24:05,061
Ah, sorry.

548
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:07,555
You're very good at this.

549
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:10,012
- I don't like blood okay? 
- So leave it alone.

550
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:11,301
No, I can't leave it.

551
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:14,358
Do you want to tell me what happened?

552
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:16,186
Nothing.

553
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:18,152
What are you doing?

554
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,533
- I'm going to fix the window. 
- Forget the window.

555
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:21,962
I can't forget the window.

556
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:24,322
I made a promise and I'm the reliable guy

557
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:27,046
who helps everybody out whether they like it or not.

558
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:28,260
- What? 
- Oh, yeah.

559
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,616
Nothing I can do about it, just the way I am.

560
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,653
It is my big problem.

561
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:35,080
Didn't know it was my big problem until today,

562
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:38,874
but now I know. It is my big problem.

563
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,592
- Got a handful of Barbie. 
- Luke, what happened today?

564
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:45,479
Today I found out what a big, dumb, idiot guy I am.

565
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:50,559
Just an imposing, judgmental know-it-all who blows around yelling

566
00:24:50,686 --> 00:24:53,804
and complaining and screwing up everybody else's life.

567
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:55,734
- I hardly think you're... 
- I'm dumb.

568
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:58,596
Yeah, not like Jess. Jess is smart.

569
00:24:58,756 --> 00:25:00,926
You know, he doesn't care about anybody else's life.

570
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:04,126
He just takes care of himself.

571
00:25:04,623 --> 00:25:05,908
Did you and Jess have a thing?

572
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:08,110
He informed me that I am nothing

573
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:12,011
but an unwelcome burden to everyone around me.

574
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:15,427
- Luke, that's not true. 
- Yes, it is.

575
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:16,860
Luke, stop it.

576
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,437
Liz was just saying today how grateful she is to have you as her brother

577
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,654
- and how much she looks up to you. 
- You talked to Liz?

578
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:25,810
- I thought she was you. 
- I'm a man.

579
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:27,413
She was in your truck.

580
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:30,055
When I'm in my truck, I'm still a man.

581
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:32,276
I couldn't see who was driving, okay?

582
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:34,473
I went over the truck and we met and we started talking.

583
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:35,861
You shouldn't have talked to Liz.

584
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:37,499
She worships you.

585
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:41,882
She said she even wants to move to Stars Hollow so she can be closer to you.

586
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,308
- She didn't say that. 
- She did say that.

587
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:47,827
Jess is an unhappy kid, Luke. He's angry.

588
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:50,535
- He doesn't mean the things he says. 
- He did me a favor.

589
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:55,573
Listen, why don't you hang out here and rest for little while, okay?

590
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,051
- We'll get you a real bandage. 
- I like the Barbie ones.

591
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:01,702
Yes, honey, but the other kids will beat you up if they see you with one of those.

592
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,070
I'll be right back.

593
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,531
You sure I can't help you?

594
00:26:20,097 --> 00:26:21,292
Can I hand you something?

595
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,961
You know, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to run.

596
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,992
Just curious--have you noticed since you started standing there,

597
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:31,465
there's been a lot less of the clinking sounds?

598
00:26:31,735 --> 00:26:34,479
And the clinking sounds are the sounds tools make when they fix things.

599
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,970
You've been fixing this car for hours.

600
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:37,726
And I'm not done, so, back off.

601
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,659
- Jess! 
- Hey, she sounds mad.

602
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:43,702
You've been here less than twenty-four hours and already I wanna kill you.

603
00:26:43,813 --> 00:26:45,585
- What did I do to you? 
- All the crap you said to Luke...

604
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:46,747
- What crap? 
- A man who has done nothing

605
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:49,584
- but support you and try to help you. 
- I don't know what you're talking about.

606
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:52,200
You do know what I'm talking about. Don't act stupid.

607
00:26:52,328 --> 00:26:55,257
Why would you do that? What an incredibly insensitive, mean-spirited--

608
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:57,719
Oh, drop it. This has nothing to do with Luke. This is about Rory.

609
00:26:57,847 --> 00:26:59,645
This is not about Rory. This is about Luke.

610
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:02,282
Don't you have an ounce of sensitivity in that thick head of yours

611
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,681
or are you so mad at the entire world that you don't care who you hurt?

612
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:07,663
And I suppose we're still not talking about Rory?

613
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:09,439
Wow, second "Rory" in ten seconds.

614
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,779
You sure have Rory on the brain. I wonder why that is.

615
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:13,874
- You started this! 
- Is that why you came back here?

616
00:27:14,078 --> 00:27:16,465
Are you still hung up on her Jess ? Is that why you came back?

617
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,621
- No. 
- Good.

618
00:27:17,908 --> 00:27:21,850
Because she is over you. She has moved on and she is very happy.

619
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,985
Please hurry up so I can get the hell out of here.

620
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:25,046
I second that.

621
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,814
I wonder where Demi and Ashton are sitting.

622
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,207
- I think we're late. 
- We're not late.

623
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:37,518
Grandma said dinner starts at six.

624
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:39,555
- Yeah, well that means seven. 
- In what universe?

625
00:27:39,677 --> 00:27:41,589
They invite you at six knowing you won't be here until seven

626
00:27:41,675 --> 00:27:43,657
so dinner won't start until eight. Actually we're early.

627
00:27:43,815 --> 00:27:45,638
Oh, there they are. Hey. Hi Mom.

628
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:48,379
- Oh, that's a bad face. 
- Told you we were late.

629
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:50,989
- What is Rory doing here? 
- Hi, Grandma.

630
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:52,304
You weren't supposed to bring Rory.

631
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:54,107
You're really helping the kid's self-esteem here, Mom.

632
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,872
You don't know one man that would be willing to spend the evening with you?

633
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,989
I thought you liked Rory.

634
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:00,091
We do like Rory but we're short of men.

635
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:01,086
Well so am I.

636
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:04,040
Honestly, Lorelai. It's not your looks that keep them away. Think about that.

637
00:28:04,137 --> 00:28:05,458
Excuse me, should I stay, or--?

638
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,685
Of course you should stay. We can't do anything about that now.

639
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,669
Come on, come on...

640
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:11,136
So on a wigged-out level of one to ten, Mom is at--

641
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:12,174
- Frances Farmer? 
- Yeah.

642
00:28:12,717 --> 00:28:14,439
Rory, what are you doing here?

643
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,219
Lorelai couldn't find a man.

644
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,160
You weren't specific, Mom. You didn't say, "Bring a man."

645
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:20,521
And if I had, you would have been able to find one?

646
00:28:20,624 --> 00:28:21,590
Rory, sit over there.

647
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:25,553
Marjorie, Shawna, this is my daughter Lorelai and her daughter Rory.

648
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,958
This is Marjorie and Shawna.

649
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:29,707
Who are Marjorie and Shawna?

650
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,980
Richard and Jason's secretaries.

651
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:35,794
Dull girls, like two rolling pins sitting across from you, but we were desperate.

652
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:37,627
- Hello, Emily, Richard. 
- Ah, Jason.

653
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:38,657
You're late, Jason.

654
00:28:38,804 --> 00:28:41,140
I know, I'm sorry but I got hung up talking to Feriman in the lobby.

655
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,178
Feriman is here?

656
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:44,120
Yes, and he's three drinks ahead of everybody else.

657
00:28:44,283 --> 00:28:46,177
- Oh, marvelous. 
- No, don't sit there!

658
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:48,846
- Sit next to Lorelai. Rory move over. 
- Why?

659
00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:50,576
- You two, pretend you're together. 
- What?

660
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:51,615
Emily, good idea.

661
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:54,702
Shawna, Marjorie, for God's sake, look like you belong here.

662
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:57,002
Oh yes, that's much better.

663
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:59,194
- So who else is joining us? 
- No one.

664
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,553
We brought one of Richard's coats to hang over the chair.

665
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:03,181
We're saying it's Marjorie's husband.

666
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:06,254
He's making the rounds and at about eight he'll get sick and have to leave.

667
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:08,071
Does everybody understand the story?

668
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:10,653
I think so. But then we'll have to hide his jacket.

669
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:13,657
So I suggest I put it under my dress and pretend to be pregnant,

670
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:16,939
then Jason can pretend to be the doctor, then Rory can dig a tunnel, and...

671
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:19,269
I might have known you'd turn this into something ridiculous, Lorelai.

672
00:29:19,352 --> 00:29:20,381
Yeah, I wanna be the doctor.

673
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,614
Oh good Lord.

674
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:23,897
And Jason, move closer to Lorelai.

675
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,714
And for God's sake, you two, at least act like you like each other.

676
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,845
Hey, your mom said.

677
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:33,375
Hey, there you are.

678
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:36,867
Yes here I am, at my job. Will wonders never cease?

679
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:39,110
- Major party happening outside. 
- So I hear.

680
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,184
You gotta see it.

681
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,437
I'm sure you can see enough for the both of us.

682
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:44,925
Big fire, crazy punch, too.

683
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:46,815
Seriously, man, come on out. You won't believe it.

684
00:29:46,898 --> 00:29:49,748
No, T.J., actually, I will believe it, because, see, I live here,

685
00:29:49,897 --> 00:29:54,167
so I've seen this festival, oh let's say, about five thousand times.

686
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,679
Yes, I see your point.

687
00:29:55,832 --> 00:29:58,862
Okay, Liz and I are taking off right after the festivities,

688
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:00,654
so maybe you can come out and say sayonara.

689
00:30:00,818 --> 00:30:02,503
- I'll come out as soon as I can. 
- Great.

690
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,018
How long do you think?

691
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:05,504
How long I think what?

692
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:06,860
How long do you think you will be doing that?

693
00:30:06,998 --> 00:30:08,755
- I don't know. 
- Looks like you're almost done.

694
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:11,017
- Well I'm not. 
- The stack is getting pretty small.

695
00:30:11,147 --> 00:30:13,485
Look, I will be out soon, okay?

696
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:14,299
Okay.

697
00:30:15,252 --> 00:30:17,658
- I am going to hold you to that. 
- I consider myself warned.

698
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:25,292
The importance cannot be overstated.

699
00:30:25,347 --> 00:30:28,400
Language is humanity's lifeline.

700
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,876
That is why I thank each and every one of you

701
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:38,400
for your loyal support of the Ephram Wordus Rare Manuscript Acquisition Foundation.

702
00:30:38,774 --> 00:30:44,329
Because without it, we would just be stuck rooting around Nag Hammadi.

703
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:49,034
Psst! I don't get it.

704
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:50,826
- Me neither. 
- You go to Yale.

705
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:53,289
I skipped Obscure Manuscript Humor 101.

706
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:54,573
Hey, why was that funny?

707
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,750
- No... no idea. 
- You were laughing.

708
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,617
Take a poll. No one in this room has any idea

709
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:01,184
what this crazy old man is talking about.

710
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:02,525
What a bunch of poseurs.

711
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:05,040
...hundreds of literary artifacts

712
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:07,860
which might otherwise have been lost.

713
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:09,636
How far do you think we can push this?

714
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:10,999
- I'm not sure. 
- Dancing?

715
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:12,524
- Possibly. 
- Stroll on the terrace?

716
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:13,114
Passable.

717
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:14,557
Making out in the coat-check room?

718
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,997
Oh, that's going to be tricky.

719
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,344
So, once again, I thank you

720
00:31:19,513 --> 00:31:22,340
and I hope you all have a lovely evening.

721
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:29,231
I'm going to go find Feriman.

722
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,438
I have to say hello to Babe Wellington.

723
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,638
Mom, how much longer do Jason and I have to pretend to be together?

724
00:31:35,044 --> 00:31:36,911
Lorelai, don't do this to me.

725
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:40,430
Until this evening is over, you are together and I don't want to discuss it again.

726
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:41,243
Fine.

727
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,054
- I just secured us the coatroom. 
- Let's go.

728
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:47,172
I'm going to make out in the coatroom. Don't eat my chicken.

729
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,345
That's going on your tombstone.

730
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:49,497
Jason.

731
00:31:50,004 --> 00:31:52,452
Oh, hello. I didn't know you'd be here.

732
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,880
- You look well. 
- Thank you.

733
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:55,211
- How is business? 
- Very good.

734
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:57,018
- I'm pleased to hear. 
- How's your golf game?

735
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,989
Well it certainly can't match yours but I'm catching up.

736
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,155
- Well, when you're ready… 
- I'll give you a call.

737
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:02,808
Fine. Good to see you again.

738
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:03,679
Same to you.

739
00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:07,642
Well, who was that?

740
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:09,592
- My father. 
- Your father?

741
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,739
And you two have met before?

742
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:14,887
Yes, briefly. I believe there was an Aquaman party involved.

743
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:18,205
Oh, man. This business thing must have been really bad for you guys.

744
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:18,972
What do you mean?

745
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:22,110
I mean, that was so cold. You talked like you barely knew each other.

746
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,935
Oh, no, no, we've always been like that.

747
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:24,948
You're kidding.

748
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:27,774
No, actually, asking me about my golf game

749
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:29,952
was actually a little too touchy-feely for me.

750
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:33,058
Wow, who would have thought I would ever put my mother

751
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,839
next to someone and think, "warm?"

752
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:37,493
Jason, I just heard your father was here.

753
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,216
How could you possibly have found that out this quickly?

754
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,152
News travels fast here. People talk.

755
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:44,200
- So, what did Floyd say? 
- Well...

756
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:46,350
Richard, Floyd was just here.

757
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:47,680
We know, Mom, we saw him.

758
00:32:47,984 --> 00:32:50,001
He came by the table? What nerve.

759
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:52,478
- How dare he talk to his son. 
- Be quiet, Lorelai.

760
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,205
If he's here he must have a motive.

761
00:32:54,312 --> 00:32:57,066
That's right. He never cared about rare manuscripts before.

762
00:32:57,195 --> 00:32:58,930
He must be trying to get information.

763
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,512
Richard, I don't think he had an agenda.

764
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:02,171
What was his body language like?

765
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,198
He was breathing and standing.

766
00:33:04,404 --> 00:33:05,842
I think all signs point to alive.

767
00:33:06,063 --> 00:33:08,074
What did he ask you about?

768
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:09,354
He asked me about my golf game.

769
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:10,650
- Not the business? 
- No.

770
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,303
Oh, oh, oh. He's tricky.

771
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:14,055
He didn't ask about the business, Dad, okay?

772
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:16,861
I know he didn't ask about the business, Lorelai. That was deliberate.

773
00:33:16,984 --> 00:33:19,615
So he wanted to know nothing on purpose? The fiend.

774
00:33:19,794 --> 00:33:20,802
Please, stay out of it.

775
00:33:20,962 --> 00:33:23,672
He is planning something. Jason, I think we should strategize.

776
00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:24,951
Richard, I really don't think...

777
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,849
I have been doing this a lot longer than you have, my boy.

778
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:31,284
If a man like Floyd Stiles comes over to you and does not ask about the business,

779
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:33,941
you can be sure that something very big is coming.

780
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:38,764
I guess I have to go. If you'll excuse me, ladies.

781
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,991
Bye. Nobody was believing you two as a couple anyway.

782
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:23,504
This is Bird Dog One to Bird Dog Two.

783
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,706
The southwest corner is secure.

784
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:27,538
I'm at the southwest corner, Kirk.

785
00:34:28,325 --> 00:34:29,279
Then where the hell am I?

786
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:33,273
Well, look who finally came out of his cave.

787
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:35,213
Oh, Carrie. What a coincidence.

788
00:34:35,372 --> 00:34:36,933
You remember Anna, Jill.

789
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,695
Hello, Anna. Hello, Jill.

790
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,623
We just came from the reunion so we're a little tipsy.

791
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:45,838
Ah, you know, drink water, and take some aspirin before you go to bed.

792
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:48,545
I told them that you're trying to pretend

793
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:51,121
that you don't remember the night.

794
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:53,040
I don't remember the night.

795
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,657
- I remember the night. 
- The whole reunion remembered the night

796
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,536
- We all talked about it. 
- Terrific.

797
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,866
Everybody had a crush on Butch Danes in high school.

798
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:02,523
So serious, so intense.

799
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,760
So hot in those tiny little shorts.

800
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:07,003
Okay, I should go find Liz.

801
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,545
Oh, I'll help you find her.

802
00:35:08,652 --> 00:35:10,505
Oh, no, I don't wanna break up the party.

803
00:35:10,618 --> 00:35:12,466
Oh, there's always room for a foursome.

804
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,906
So twenty years later, none of you are married?

805
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,141
Oh, no, we're all married.

806
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,180
Oh, there's Liz.

807
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:21,144
They're not gonna run out of punch are they?

808
00:35:21,237 --> 00:35:24,032
- They never run out of punch. 
- Oh, okay, I should go.

809
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:30,417
Wait, we're all going to the Styx/REO Speedwagon/Journey concert next week.

810
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,614
We have an extra ticket if you're interested.

811
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:36,857
Oh, wow. If it was just Styx and REO Speedwagon,

812
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:39,485
I'd be there, but Journey freaks me out.

813
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:41,000
Sorry. Enjoy the festival.

814
00:35:42,526 --> 00:35:46,545
So there's a line a mile long, the place is going crazy for the earrings.

815
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:47,896
Oh, come on T.J.

816
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:49,586
Hey, I'm just telling it how it is.

817
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:53,380
The last fair we went, the line was so long it blocked the fruit-ice stand.

818
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:57,728
And traditionally the fruit-ice people are not the nicest people on the circuit

819
00:35:57,844 --> 00:36:00,052
but you block their stand and they really go crazy.

820
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,515
They threw lemon rinds. But it didn't matter.

821
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:04,439
Most people stayed and they bought plenty.

822
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:06,309
People seem to like my stuff.

823
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:09,192
We're heading to Minnesota next month. Big fair there.

824
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,199
And this time we're unveiling the booth.

825
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,356
The booth?

826
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:15,673
T.J. just built me the greatest booth. You should see it.

827
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:18,806
You've gotta have a good booth. It's the first thing people see.

828
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:20,696
Earrings are small. You don't know they're there

829
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,141
until you're right up on them, but a booth and a nice sign?

830
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:27,286
A person's standing at the jousting match,

831
00:36:27,445 --> 00:36:29,856
they turn around and,"Hey, look at that booth with the nice sign."

832
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:33,122
They come over, take a look at Lizzie's stuff, and bam, they're hooked.

833
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:35,970
Well, Luke, nice of you to join us.

834
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:37,423
Oh hi, Luke, I didn't see you there.

835
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:39,932
Yeah, I heard you were leaving right after the festival, so...

836
00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:42,278
I'm so glad that you came out.

837
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,222
See you later, Liz.

838
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:49,532
Can you believe this thing? It hasn't changed one bit since we were kids.

839
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:52,138
Yeah, same crazy gathering that Mom would take us to.

840
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:55,109
- And then Dad after she died. 
- He hated it worse than we did.

841
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,772
He only took us 'cause Mom liked it.

842
00:36:56,935 --> 00:37:00,310
- Of course, that Founder's Day punch… 
- Lethal.

843
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:03,305
The first time I ever threw up on booze it was Founder's Day punch.

844
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:04,319
That's a nice story.

845
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:08,451
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about Jess.

846
00:37:08,783 --> 00:37:11,180
Boy, that statement could encompass a whole myriad of things.

847
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,575
I'm sorry I told you I wasn't in touch with him.

848
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:17,575
It's just been the last six months he started calling and he asked me not to tell you,

849
00:37:17,707 --> 00:37:19,893
so I was trying to bond or something.

850
00:37:20,723 --> 00:37:22,331
I just mentioned the car to him.

851
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:24,036
I didn't know he'd come back here and try to take it.

852
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,786
It's okay. It's his car and he should have it.

853
00:37:27,124 --> 00:37:28,762
I'm just trying to make things better with us.

854
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:31,256
You should. It's fine.

855
00:37:32,172 --> 00:37:33,595
I have a feeling about him.

856
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,311
I think he's going to be okay.

857
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:38,168
He's kinda like Dad, don't you think?

858
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:41,324
- Oh, I don't know. 
- Oh, I do. I think he's like Dad.

859
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:44,988
I want to thank you for everything that you did for him.

860
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:46,882
Well it never hurts to take a shot.

861
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,700
At least you know you tried.

862
00:37:49,094 --> 00:37:51,591
Sometimes things take a while before they sink in.

863
00:37:52,074 --> 00:37:52,909
It did with me.

864
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,627
Sorry, I'm so boring tonight.

865
00:37:55,837 --> 00:37:57,292
I only had one cup of punch.

866
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:59,963
Gary switched us over to club soda after that.

867
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:01,203
You're not boring.

868
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:04,296
- Who's Gary? 
- That's T.J.'s real name.

869
00:38:04,423 --> 00:38:05,514
T.J.'s real name is Gary?

870
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:06,470
Gary?

871
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:08,350
How the heck did he get - Never mind.

872
00:38:08,781 --> 00:38:12,436
I heard him talking back there, Gary.

873
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:14,940
It sounds like things are going pretty good.

874
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:16,926
- They are. Really good. 
- Good, good.

875
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:21,325
Oh, hey, wait. I just made these last night.

876
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:24,407
You can give them to your wife.

877
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,818
Or Lorelai. Whoever...

878
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:28,493
Thanks.

879
00:38:28,646 --> 00:38:31,191
Well, I'm going get my stuff together. We need to leave soon.

880
00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:33,402
- Tell Gary I went back to your place. 
- I'll do that.

881
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,098
See you.

882
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:47,130
Gone for the rest of the night. We're stuck with the rolling pins.

883
00:38:47,273 --> 00:38:49,874
- God! So boring! 
- I am starving.

884
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:53,203
What? The possibly beef and some sort of cream sauce

885
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:54,442
did nothing to curb your appetite?

886
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,659
Do you want to start with burgers or do a cart-to-cart attack?

887
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,689
There's two of us. I think we can accomplish both goals.

888
00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:01,543
I'm going to get the burgers, you hit the carts.

889
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:02,624
- I'll meet you by the bonfire. 
- Okay.

890
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,450
- T.J. 
- Hi, you're here. Cool.

891
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:08,452
Yeah, so, Liz is back at my place getting your stuff,

892
00:39:08,534 --> 00:39:10,544
- she just wanted me to tell you. 
- Okay. Thanks.

893
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,922
So look, I kind of heard you guys talking,

894
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:18,925
and things seem to be going pretty good for Liz which is different,

895
00:39:19,038 --> 00:39:22,529
and a nice change, and I know that you guys are thinking about moving here,

896
00:39:22,786 --> 00:39:27,266
and I just wanted you to know, it's okay by me.

897
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:30,042
Okay. I didn't realize we needed your permission.

898
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:33,534
Oh, no. You don't.

899
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:34,879
Maybe you misunderstood me here.

900
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:39,002
I was just trying to say that I assumed because my sister has a history with guys,

901
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:41,398
you know, that, you know, you were like the others.

902
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,414
But, you seem like a pretty good guy.

903
00:39:44,628 --> 00:39:46,697
Thanks. You're a dick.

904
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:51,541
So, I just heard the tail end of that conversation

905
00:39:51,658 --> 00:39:53,487
and I'm assuming you haven't changed your name to Richard?

906
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:55,448
Long, long story. I'll tell you later,

907
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:58,156
but here's a teaser: the word Etch-A-Sketch comes up.

908
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,996
I'm hooked.

909
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:01,289
You're all dressed up.

910
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:02,390
Just for you.

911
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:04,003
You go somewhere?

912
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:06,942
My parents had a charity event and

913
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:09,932
they needed a chair filled and who fills a chair better than I?

914
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:10,941
No one comes to mind.

915
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:13,609
So, did Jess leave yet?

916
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:19,015
I stopped by Gypsy's earlier and she was just about done then, so probably.

917
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,202
- No good-byes? 
- No.

918
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,228
Liz has a feeling about him, though. She thinks he's gonna be fine.

919
00:40:25,565 --> 00:40:26,798
- He could be. 
- Yeah.

920
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:29,393
Oh, hey,

921
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:32,998
here.

922
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,008
Pretty.

923
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:42,609
Liz made them yesterday. She wanted you to have them.

924
00:40:43,725 --> 00:40:46,433
Oh, great. Well, be sure to tell her thanks for me.

925
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:47,157
I will.

926
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,334
- There. 
- Thank you for your business.

927
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:59,336
- Do not come again. 
- Not likely.

928
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:31,028
- I get to leave first! 
- Rory, wait! Stop!

929
00:41:31,163 --> 00:41:32,437
No, you don't get to walk away!

930
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:35,664
- Hold on! 
- My town! I leave!

931
00:41:35,765 --> 00:41:37,460
I just wanna--where are you going?

932
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:39,599
- None of your business! 
- We look like idiots.

933
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:41,350
- I don't care! 
- Stop running!

934
00:41:41,857 --> 00:41:43,527
- Stop following! 
- Oh, come on!

935
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,427
Go away, I'm leaving!

936
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,315
- Rory, stop! 
- Why?

937
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:48,549
Because I wanna talk to you.

938
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,980
About what? What do you want to talk to me about?

939
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:53,460
When did you learn to run like that?

940
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:55,773
You know, I have actually thought about this moment.

941
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:58,394
A lot. What would Jess say to me I ever saw him again?

942
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:02,097
I mean, he just took off, no note, no call, nothing, how could he explain that?

943
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,388
And then a year goes by. No word, nothing,

944
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:08,384
so he couldn't possibly have a good excuse for that, right?

945
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:11,209
I have imagined hundreds of different scenarios

946
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:14,119
with a hundred different great last parting lines,

947
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:16,766
and I have to tell you that I am actually very curious

948
00:42:16,874 --> 00:42:18,292
to see which way this is going to go.

949
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,512
Could we sit down?

950
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:23,713
No. You wanted to talk, so talk.

951
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:25,327
What do you have to say to me?

952
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:31,409
I love you.
