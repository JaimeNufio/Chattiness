1
00:00:02,944 --> 00:00:04,810
Oh! Winded-- too many steps.

2
00:00:04,856 --> 00:00:06,068
I said I'd carry them.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:07,534
Need water. Gunga din!

4
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:08,791
They're not that heavy.

5
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:10,949
You should take those steps out.
They get in the way.

6
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:13,584
First thing tomorrow.
Man, you bought a lot of stuff.

7
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:17,363
All stuff I need or want or think I might
some day need or want. Okay,
let's find your new wallet!

8
00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:18,798
We can get it later.

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,786
No, it's buried in here somewhere.

10
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:21,864
Have I looked in this bag already?

11
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,911
You didn't have to buy me a new wallet.
My old wallet was fine.

12
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:26,187
Your old wallet has velcro.

13
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,226
It works.

14
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,470
It's disgusting. Come on, let's find it.

15
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,075
Wait a second. What is this?

16
00:00:31,342 --> 00:00:32,409
Your underwear.

17
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:34,298
Ah, thanks a lot.

18
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:36,501
I didn't see how big they were.
What are they doing in there?

19
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,012
Well, I guessing probably hiding
from their real owners,

20
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:40,899
'cause I would hate to be wrapped
around the woman who fit those.

21
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,676
You grabbed the wrong bag.

22
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:44,173
Poor thing, she's single.

23
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,069
It still applies.

24
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:49,498
Hello?

25
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:52,960
Sookie, slow down,
I can't understand a word you're saying.

26
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:54,282
She's got huge feet.

27
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:55,785
The Inn's on fire?!

28
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:56,359
What?

29
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:58,770
The stove is on fire? Well, put it out.

30
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:01,766
It's out? So you're saying there was a fire,
but now it's out.

31
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,149
Good, what's the damage?

32
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,327
You had a fire?

33
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:08,036
Okay, okay, good. I'll be right there.

34
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,864
The wall behind the stove caught fire.
There's damage, but nothing major. Thank god.

35
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,912
Come on. I'll take you.

36
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:16,121
Oh, my god, another fire at the Inn,
like the Independence Inn.

37
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:18,232
Oh no. Am I a fire starter?
I'm a fire starter, aren't I?

38
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:20,506
You are not a fire starter.
Caesar, we'll be right back.

39
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:22,367
- What about the bags?
- Caesar will put the bags away. Let's go.

40
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:25,208
Go first, in case things burst into
flames behind me as I walk.

41
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,072
Will do.

42
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:26,692
I saw my whole life pass before my
eyes-- that's how traumatic it was!

43
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,880
She's been Scarlett O'Hara for two hours.

44
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,921
It's sickening.

45
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:32,763
My whole life-- flash-- I mean,
that's upsetting!

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,409
You know, not that it's been a bad life,

47
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:36,924
although I could have skipped
seeing "Mummenschanz."

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,401
Do you want to hand me the screwdriver?

49
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:40,481
I would kind of need a third hand to do that.

50
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:41,314
Why are the boys bickering?

51
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,531
There's something in the air today.

52
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,354
Could you not shine that in my face?

53
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:45,531
Just move your face.

54
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:46,920
You mean off of my head?

55
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:49,547
So, Mutt and Jeff,
what's the prognosis there?

56
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:51,177
When's the last time you
checked your ductwork?

57
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,343
Never.

58
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,571
Oh, boy, I shouldn't be allowed in a kitchen!

59
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:56,876
My guess is that the grease
built up in the back,

60
00:02:56,917 --> 00:03:00,346
and the ventilation's not great,
and the wall heated up, and it burned.

61
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:01,149
So what do we do?

62
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,570
Don't tell me we're shut down!

63
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:06,791
Repair the wall before you put the
stove back, and you're gonna
have to clean your ductwork.

64
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:08,549
Which means closing the kitchen till you do.

65
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,067
Well, then, fix it now.

66
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,186
You need a pro to do this.

67
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,044
If an insurance guy doesn't see it
before you fix it, he won't pay.

68
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,170
Well, I've already talked
to the insurance company.

69
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,366
They've never heard of us.

70
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,401
That's impossible-- we're customers.
We send them a check every month.

71
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,577
The people I talked to-- all very rude,
by the way--

72
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,036
said they don't even cover
businesses such as ours.

73
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,944
Again. A mistake. I'll get the policy out,
I'll call them myself.

74
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:29,022
Thank you.

75
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,108
You really should get a second screwdriver.

76
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:32,355
Nag, nag, nag.

77
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,428
- We should be flayed.
- Don't overreact, Nora.

78
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,134
We should never have let it get to this
point. We're all at fault here.

79
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,777
It's a humiliation.

80
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:44,243
Ladies, we know this.
No one is more embarrassed than myself,
but what are we going to do?

81
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,159
How many tables are still unsold?

82
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,706
- Over half.
- Oh! Unbelievable!

83
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,779
This is a function for our troops.

84
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:52,799
We'll be the laughingstock of the D.A.R.

85
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:56,294
We'll lose our national accreditation,
and this is a very weak drink.

86
00:03:56,347 --> 00:03:57,556
It's just punch, Nora.

87
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:58,753
My point, dear.

88
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:00,537
I simply don't understand people.

89
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:04,323
This money was designated for additional
armor for the boys at Fort Drum.

90
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,390
We've insulted the organization,
insulted our troops.

91
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:10,298
We might as well march to Mount Vernon,
drop our drawers,

92
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,669
and do something foul on George
Washington's grave.

93
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:13,279
Nora!

94
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:16,253
I'm sorry, but I'm really upset about this,

95
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,753
and I'm far too sober to put it
in any sort of perspective.

96
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:23,040
But the function is still a week away.
There's time to fix this.

97
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,812
Rory, you're darling.

98
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,836
She's new, ladies.

99
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:27,010
A week is nothing.

100
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:28,765
Again, what do we do?

101
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,404
We should cancel the event.

102
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:31,559
This is a nightmare.

103
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:34,509
Is Constance not showing her face on purpose?

104
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,173
Would you?

105
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:36,102
Why would Constance...?

106
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:38,064
She's running the event-- into the ground.

107
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,972
I blame myself. I let her talk me into it.

108
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:42,379
She's never slipped up like this before.

109
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,315
Is it definitely too late to do something?

110
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,282
To do what?

111
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:48,679
I don't know. To publicize the event more,
get those tables sold?

112
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:51,066
We spent our budget for publicity.
We're wiped out.

113
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:52,969
A budget is just an estimation.

114
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,471
It's guesswork, fake numbers.

115
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,807
In any business endeavor,
sometimes it makes sense

116
00:04:56,859 --> 00:05:00,006
to run a deficit in order to achieve
a bigger payoff later.

117
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:02,484
We're lunching with Grover Norquist.

118
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,985
Well, have we tried getting the word out
online? A lot can be done that way.

119
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:09,553
And maybe we can add some
entertainment or a theme,

120
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,900
send out some e-mails.
E-mailing doesn't cost a thing.

121
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,151
We hadn't thought about e-mail.

122
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,925
I think there's a way to correct this.
A week is plenty of time.

123
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:18,793
Well, well, well, we have a star amongst us.

124
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:19,585
- Who?
- You.

125
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:20,279
Me?

126
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:21,850
- Take it over.
- What?

127
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:24,083
I think that's a wonderful idea!

128
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:25,990
I don't know.
We have a mountain here, ladies.

129
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,178
We're screwing the pooch, Emily,
and we've got to go balls out.

130
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:34,080
I will not have those priggish twigs from the
New York chapters lording this over us.

131
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:38,271
We need to take a swing here,
and babe Ruth sits before us.

132
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:39,605
You shouldn't feel pressured.

133
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:40,447
I know.

134
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:44,610
If Rory doesn't think she can do it,
she'll turn us down.

135
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,937
I suppose that's true.

136
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:47,556
What do you say, slugger?

137
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:50,925
- I'll do it.
- Yes!

138
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,243
Let's ring Constance.

139
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,018
We'll put you in touch with the people
at the venue immediately.

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,784
And you'll have an assistant, Lacey.
You'll love her.

141
00:05:57,845 --> 00:05:58,882
I'd look at the menu.

142
00:05:58,955 --> 00:06:00,824
And we'll set up a discretionary fund.

143
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:03,542
This publicity idea you were
thinking of may be the key.

144
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:12,502
Dig in, everybody.

145
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:14,945
I'm past digging, I'm burrowing.
This is delicious.

146
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:17,592
Tri-tip on the barbecue-- you can't beat it.

147
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,429
- Hey, you turn the barbecue off?
- The barbecue is off.

148
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:22,320
- Good stuff, huh?
- Really good.

149
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,367
Thanks. Excuse me.
Davey, turn the volume down!

150
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,095
The vegetables are good, Sookie.

151
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:30,758
Thanks, Luke.
Davey, you heard your father-- turn it down!

152
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,201
- I'll turn it down.
- No, we want Davey to do it.

153
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:34,337
That's how he learns.

154
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,284
You heard me, son. Turn it down.

155
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,487
- Turn it down!
- Right now.

156
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,506
Ooh, I need a lemon slice.

157
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:43,080
So did anybody see that new
show on TV last night?

158
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:46,280
Where they were solving crimes by cutting
bodies open and poking their organs?

159
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:46,899
No.

160
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:49,965
Where they're solving crimes from 30
years ago by going to graveyards

161
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,382
and cutting open bodies and
poking their organs?

162
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,180
No.

163
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:55,837
The one where people are missing,
and they find their bodies,

164
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,924
cut them open, and poke their organs,
and that's how they solve crimes?

165
00:06:58,981 --> 00:06:59,523
No.

166
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,661
- What else is on?
- You gotta turn the TV down, son!

167
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,501
- Are you sure you don't want me to--
- He's got to learn.

168
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,726
You heard me, son! Volume down!

169
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,462
- Volume down!
- Listen to your mother!

170
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:12,024
What's that show I'm thinking of?

171
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:12,932
I'm back.

172
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:15,350
You like the squash, Luke?

173
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:16,930
Oh, this is gonna bug me.

174
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:18,314
I'm not a big fan of the squash.

175
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:20,043
I forgot the pepper flakes.

176
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:21,657
Sookie, your food's getting cold.

177
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:22,904
I thought you liked squash.

178
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:23,742
Nope.

179
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,505
What's that vegetable I thought you liked?

180
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:29,447
Hey Sookie, do you have a fork for Paul Anka?
He likes his own fork. Plastic preferred.

181
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:30,340
Got one here.

182
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:33,653
Oh, now this is gonna bug me!
What is that vegetable?

183
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:36,034
The plastic's too high for me to reach.
It's up there.

184
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:38,345
I'll get it. You have to eat.

185
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,760
Jackson, what's that smell?

186
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,390
Oh, man, I left the barbecue on.

187
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:45,219
We cannot set this place on fire, too.
I have had enough fires this week.

188
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:46,332
I'll get it.

189
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,506
Turn the volume down, Davey.
I'm not gonna tell you twice.

190
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:52,777
Here you go. It's nice and lean,
the way you like it.

191
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:54,812
Dog who doesn't like fat is just weird.

192
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:55,792
He's not weird.

193
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:58,067
He's trying to maintain his
bathing-suit figure.

194
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,694
So, speaking of my least favorite
word in the world-- fire--

195
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:03,152
where are we with the insurance company?

196
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:05,504
Nowhere.
I got the same runaround they gave Michel.

197
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:09,173
Let's just do the work. Forget the insurance.
Give me back my kitchen.

198
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,775
Tom's all ready to jump in, but we can't
afford to do it without the insurance money.

199
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:13,895
That's why we have insurance.

200
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,582
We have stupid insurance.

201
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:17,913
- Wasn't this policy set up by your--
- Yes.

202
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,549
- Does it mean that you have to--
- Yes.

203
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:23,484
- Sorry. - I know.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

204
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:25,225
I'll call him tomorrow.

205
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:26,451
Barbecue's off.

206
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:27,448
Martha's up.

207
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:28,437
I'm on it.

208
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:30,051
Turn the TV down, Davey.

209
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:32,896
Turn it down. You heard us-- turn it down.

210
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:38,099
I'm gonna count to 10, Davey, then the TV
is going off for the rest of the week.

211
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,311
10...

212
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,799
9...

213
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,106
8...

214
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:43,547
7...

215
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,938
6...

216
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,083
5...

217
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:47,324
4...

218
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:48,792
3...

219
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:50,101
2...

220
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,055
1...

221
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,295
She threw out the menu.

222
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:01,416
Hmm?

223
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:03,854
Rory-- she's changed the entire menu.

224
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,370
What menu?

225
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:07,851
Richard, listen when I talk to you.

226
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,062
I'm sorry, Emily.

227
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:12,705
It takes a second to emerge from Samuel
Beckett. He's a strange man.

228
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:13,666
Go on.

229
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,651
Rory threw out the entire menu
for the Fort Drum event.

230
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:20,489
I mean granted, Constance was going with
cornish game hen-- been there, done that--

231
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:22,636
and her fetish for Brussels
sprouts is upsetting.

232
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:25,906
But to throw out the entire
menu so close to the event?

233
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:30,767
I can't say that I'm a big fan of D.A.R.
cuisine, so I may not be of much help.

234
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:32,867
I'm trying not to butt in,
but how can I not worry?

235
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:34,508
By not thinking about it.

236
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,527
Is there still a U.S.O?

237
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:38,070
I think so. Why?

238
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:39,932
That's the theme, the U.S.O.--

239
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,877
Or that's where it's being held.

240
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:46,283
Oh, my god,
she didn't change the menu and the location?
Is that possible?

241
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,766
You should ask her.

242
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,162
I'm trying to keep out of it.

243
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,984
You're doing a terrific job.

244
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,439
She's not serving salmon puffs.

245
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:56,248
Good night, Mr. Beckett.

246
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:58,155
We've never not served salmon puffs.

247
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:01,365
Not in 25 years have we staged
an event without salmon puffs.

248
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:02,893
Emily, please.

249
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:04,130
It's Rory.

250
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:06,497
What she tackles, she conquers.

251
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:09,032
This girl could name the state capitals at 3,

252
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:11,724
recite the periodic table at 4,

253
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:15,727
discuss Schopenhauer's influence
on Nietzsche when she was 10.

254
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:19,094
She's read every book by every
author with a Russian surname

255
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:23,950
and had a 4.2 grade-point average at one of
the toughest schools on the east coast.

256
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:28,831
If she's excluding salmon puffs, she has
a good reason to exclude salmon puffs.

257
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:34,171
And I, for one, have complete confidence
in her ability to tackle this job,

258
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,236
and so should you.

259
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,405
Fine, go back to your Beckett.

260
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:40,350
Thank you.

261
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,948
Salmon puffs.

262
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,291
We'll show 'em, huh, guys?!

263
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:52,759
We'll show 'em you don't need fancy
stuff like stoves in order
to make a delicious meal.

264
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:55,882
We've got salads-- lots and lots of salads--

265
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,389
caprese and endive and arugula and-- ooh!--

266
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:05,240
cold sandwiches and beef carpaccio and tuna
carpaccio and vegetable carpaccio and--

267
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,312
oh, my god.
Am I ever gonna get the stove back?
I'm dying here!

268
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:10,397
- Okay, hang in there, hon.
- Thanks.

269
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:14,014
Lorelai, I hope it's all right
walking in like this.

270
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,852
I knew where the kitchen was,
so I just figured I'd come back.

271
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:17,567
Sookie.

272
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:19,796
You're our knight in shining armor,
Mr. Gilmore.

273
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,950
This is Harris. He'll do the inspection,
get the lay of the land.

274
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,253
Shouldn't take long.

275
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,398
Go ahead and start.

276
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,776
I should apologize for the
red tape and the delay.

277
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:32,477
As a rule,
we don't take on small accounts like this,

278
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:34,234
except under extraordinary circumstances.

279
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,119
Until the news reached my desk,
no one was sure of what to do.

280
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,110
Uh-huh.

281
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,812
I can write you a check today.

282
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:42,242
Figured that would please you.

283
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:43,414
Terrific.

284
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:47,957
I'm gonna go call Tom and see if he can race
right over here and start the work.

285
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,937
Bless you, sir. You're my golden god.

286
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:03,396
So, um, how's your big plan working out?

287
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,505
Excuse me?

288
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:07,567
Oh, your big plan for Rory.
How's that going, dad?

289
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:09,392
Let me know if you need anything, Harris.

290
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:10,761
Is she back at Yale?

291
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:11,507
Lorelai--

292
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,148
Oh, I take it she's not.

293
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:14,313
No, she's not.

294
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,797
Huh. But it's in the works.

295
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:18,141
We'll be here 10 minutes.

296
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:21,110
Let me guess-- you're gonna trick
her into going back, right?

297
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:23,539
You'll drive up and drop her off at Yale,

298
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:27,339
then you'll drive away really quickly before
she catches on. Is that one of the plans?

299
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,548
Is there anything I can do
to expedite this, Harris?

300
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:32,712
You see that family of Logan's recently,
the Hamburgers?

301
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:33,780
Huntzbergers.

302
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:36,115
Right, right. How are the old Huntzbergers?

303
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,768
They behaving any better than that night
they humiliated your granddaughter?

304
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,164
They did not humiliate her.

305
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:41,590
Rory said they did.

306
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,941
I know the Huntzbergers. They're fine people.

307
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,973
What happened that night
was a misunderstanding,

308
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:47,707
because they have nothing against Rory.

309
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:48,238
No?

310
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,037
Why would they?

311
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:49,823
Ask them!

312
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:50,693
It's not true!

313
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,951
Well, then that granddaughter
of yours-- what a liar.

314
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,756
Harris, take a couple of
pictures and we'll go.

315
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:58,814
We just need the quote from
your contractor in writing.

316
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:00,955
Send all his bills directly to me.

317
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,437
- Will do.
- Goodbye.

318
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:08,836
It's been lovely.

319
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:13,522
What about silverware?

320
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,393
I can get you 1940s, the real thing.

321
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:16,976
Plates are a toughie.

322
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:17,774
Plates break.

323
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:19,988
I can get you a couple of dozen,
hand-painted, not 100.

324
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:23,514
So, what's our best bet, an off-white, new,
but made to look vintage?

325
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,511
Off-white would be super.

326
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:26,212
They should be heavy, right, solid?

327
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,638
My servers are gonna love that.

328
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:30,117
Then not too heavy.
Lacey, get me samples of all this?

329
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:30,729
Will do.

330
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:33,546
There must be a color photo
of the Hollywood canteen.

331
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:35,371
We've checked the internet. The library?

332
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:38,816
The Getty in California has one in
their collection, but they're
very flaky on the phone.

333
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:39,853
Oh, California.

334
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,120
I'm so over the west coast.

335
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,752
A bunch of granola heads.

336
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,744
Rory Gilmore's phone.

337
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:45,905
Who's calling?

338
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:46,901
One moment, please.

339
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:47,889
It's Logan Huntzberger.

340
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:48,876
I'll take that.

341
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:50,510
Hello?

342
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,926
Oh, my god. Who was that?

343
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,287
My assistant. I forwarded my phone to hers.

344
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:55,417
You have an assistant?

345
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:57,655
Just for this D.A.R. thing.
I get a million calls.

346
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,173
I consider myself lucky
to be patched through.

347
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:01,713
You have priority clearance.

348
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:04,517
So, good news. I got the P.A.
system you wanted at the price you wanted.

349
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:06,098
Really? Cool.

350
00:14:06,164 --> 00:14:07,811
Lacey, P.A. system-- done.

351
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:08,627
Excellent.

352
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,473
That's great.

353
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:12,374
This guy's done the sound at every party I've
ever thrown. He's the best in the business.

354
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,469
And, oh, goody.

355
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:17,336
Paris is here. And she looks upset.

356
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:19,238
That and a bulldozer would knock me over.

357
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,889
Excuse me? The door is locked.

358
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:21,961
Do you know her?

359
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,673
Let her in, then hide.

360
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:24,742
I'll call you later.

361
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,561
Bye.

362
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,212
"Do you know her?"

363
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,977
I'm only her best friend.
Who the hell are you?

364
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:31,764
Paris, come here. Calm down.

365
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:33,676
- What's wrong?
- I'm broke.

366
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:34,882
Broke? How?

367
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:37,540
My parents flipped the bird at the I.R.S.
one too many times.

368
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:41,362
They've frozen everything.
All I've got is my trust fund,
which doesn't kick in till I'm 25.

369
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:44,975
Unless you can whip out a magic wand
and age me four years, I'm a goner.

370
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,995
Sit down. Calm down.

371
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,874
My ATM refused me.

372
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,495
I thought it was just that particular one.

373
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,598
So I went to another, and it refused me, too.

374
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:55,013
So I went to the bank and used
a few choice expletives,

375
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,349
and a bunch of guys in suits
started closing in on me.

376
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:59,495
So I started pacing and yelling,
"Attica! Attica!"

377
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,350
Then the manager hit a little
red button under his desk,

378
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:03,471
so I ran out of there and
came right over here.

379
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:06,078
I'm a pauper. I'll be playing a
hurdy gurdy on street corners

380
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:07,826
and selling pencils out of a tin cup.

381
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:08,558
Slow down.

382
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,693
Yale's paid for through the end of the year,
thank god.

383
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,862
But what'll I do about everything
else I need? What'll I do?

384
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,566
You'll have to do what everyone
else who needs money has to do.

385
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,296
What's that?

386
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:18,450
What people do.

387
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:19,469
What am I, a mind reader?

388
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:20,541
Get a job.

389
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:21,671
A job?

390
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:24,999
I've never had a job. I don't know the
first thing about having a job.

391
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:27,058
All I've got on my resumé
is academic achievements,

392
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,795
which will mean doodly-squat when
I'm in line with 11,000 people

393
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:32,123
vying for an opening in the garden
department at Wal-Mart.

394
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:36,187
Paris, wait. As you said, Yale's paid for.
That's the bright side.

395
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:38,523
From now on,
you'll just have to keep your expenses low.

396
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:41,583
And I could get you some work-- right away.
How would that be?

397
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:43,060
- Really?
- Yes.

398
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:44,819
I know you'll be a hard worker.
That's a given.

399
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:45,837
I definitely would be.

400
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:48,365
And I speak Chinese and Farsi. That'll help.

401
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,320
Well, I need servers for the food.
You could do that, right?

402
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:52,021
I think so.

403
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:53,870
See? You're on the road to recovery.

404
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:55,934
Oh, thanks.

405
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,728
And I'll work my butt off, too, Glenda.

406
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:02,528
Oh, and I know a smattering of ancient
Aramaic, if that helps.

407
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,501
- It could.
- If Christ shows up.

408
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:05,368
And who are you?

409
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:07,434
Go home, Paris. You've had a rough day.

410
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,086
I guess.

411
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,390
I'll call you with the details.

412
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:10,318
Thanks.

413
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,516
Hey, uh, can you spot me a 20...

414
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:14,631
Sure.

415
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:16,107
5, 25?

416
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:17,493
Here you go.

417
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:18,473
Thanks.

418
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:25,352
I owe you more than you currently realize.

419
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:26,611
Okay, where were we?

420
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:28,149
Mmm.

421
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:30,228
Pasta's almost done, sauce is close, too.

422
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:32,457
We could have just used the
store-bought sauce I have.

423
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:33,857
That stuff is junk.

424
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:35,329
It's delicious Italian sauce.

425
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:36,621
Okay, first off, it's not.

426
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:40,342
Second, all you had was four already-opened
jars, two of which I
couldn't get the lids off of.

427
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:41,716
Somebody needs some gym time.

428
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,901
- And one of them had a layer of white
fuzz on it. - That was a little gross.

429
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:47,242
- And the last one, green fuzz.
- Also gross.

430
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,318
I make better, just like mama taught me.

431
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:50,610
I know you do.

432
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:53,304
- How's Paul Anka's dinner coming?
- His hamburger's close, too.

433
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:56,161
You're not overcooking it,
'cause he likes it rare plus--

434
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:58,184
you know, not too rare, but not medium rare.

435
00:16:58,245 --> 00:17:01,321
I'm cooking it to his exacting
specifications.

436
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:02,974
Miss Patty's having a recital?

437
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:05,835
Oh, yeah. It's her big annual show.

438
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:08,192
All her kids in all her
classes get to perform.

439
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,960
It's be there or be square,
best show in town.

440
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:12,693
This Thursday? This is a goood night.
I can have Caesar close for me.

441
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:13,511
Why?

442
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,630
So I can go with you.

443
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,613
Oh, no. You're not going to this recital.

444
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:17,381
Why not?

445
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:21,884
Because it's a night of kids dancing,
singing, twirling batons-- you'll hate it.

446
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:22,676
No, I won't.

447
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:23,443
Yes, you will.

448
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:26,094
It's not my first choice in entertainment,
but I'll go.

449
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,266
Luke, no.

450
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:29,799
You have been sacrificing too much
of yourself these past few months.

451
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,401
You go with me to my movies,
you tag along when I go shopping.

452
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:35,707
And that dinner at Sookie and Jackson's-- how
you kept from killing
us all, I'll never know.

453
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,425
I haven't been complaining about any of this.

454
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,597
I know,
and that has filled me with no end of guilt.

455
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,628
You've been a saint,
but you've got to do your Luke stuff, too.

456
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:44,831
When was the last time you
went camping or fishing?

457
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:46,027
You don't like camping or fishing.

458
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:47,887
That shouldn't stop you from
camping or fishing.

459
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,154
I'd go if I felt like it.

460
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:51,193
Then go Thursday while I'm at the recital.

461
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:52,982
I'll go with Sookie. It'll be fun with her.

462
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:53,555
You sure?

463
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:56,111
Yeah, go.
You haven't been camping in forever.

464
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,500
Be Grizzly Adams.

465
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:59,662
Okay, sure, I'll go camping.

466
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:00,848
Good.

467
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,993
Oh, that's officially it.

468
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:05,197
Oh, medium rare, not rare plus.
I'll get him another.

469
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:08,105
Well, I don't know why I bother.

470
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,962
The great books take practically
a lifetime to read as it is.

471
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:13,431
But if you heed the word of Mortimer Adler,

472
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:17,479
one needs to read a classic three times
to fully comprehend its meaning.

473
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,261
Yeah.

474
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:21,500
I wonder if Mortimer ever read
"Euclid's geometry" three times.

475
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,182
That's a fun read.

476
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,589
Have you read "Euclid's geometry"?

477
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:26,919
Me? No.

478
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,430
It doesn't get any drier.

479
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,278
What have you been reading lately?
I keep forgetting to ask.

480
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:32,500
Rory?

481
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:35,607
Sorry, guys.
The event's right around the corner,

482
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:36,899
and I just keep thinking
of things I have to do.

483
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:38,235
I'm just texting Lacey.

484
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,459
So how's that going?

485
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:40,390
Good, really good.

486
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,294
Good.

487
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,263
Did Lacey mention the partitions?

488
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,040
Partitions?

489
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:45,056
At Wafford Hall.

490
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:49,376
It's so big, and these partitions can cut
the room so it won't look so empty.

491
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:50,903
They're not very decorative, but they work.

492
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:52,865
Hold on just a second.

493
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:54,378
Partitions?

494
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,422
For the room.

495
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,721
But we won't have any room-- we're sold out.

496
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:58,830
Sold out?

497
00:18:58,912 --> 00:18:59,791
That's not possible.

498
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:02,029
Oh, it's a fact.
The theme got people's attention.

499
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:04,841
Plus, the online campaign
went like gangbusters.

500
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:08,215
We're having to turn people away.
That's what I was texting Lacey about.

501
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,315
I'm trying to squeeze in a few more, but
we're fighting the fire department over it.

502
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:12,706
You're turning people away?

503
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,385
But still encouraging them to give
a sizable donation to our boys.

504
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,259
Brilliant.

505
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,646
Sold out!

506
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:19,758
I knew you could do it!

507
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:20,775
Good job!

508
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,435
Thank you.

509
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:23,164
- Continue texting.
- Thank you.

510
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,612
Oh, when the band gets here,
grab Jerry and get them to do a sound check.

511
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:32,030
Make sure they're happy with the sound.
Not just Jerry, because--

512
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:33,199
Lacey? Where's my Lacey?

513
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:34,029
Here.

514
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:35,311
Come on, honey, keep up.

515
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:36,978
I spotted the security guard,
so I filled him in.

516
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:38,990
Excellent. Cross that off the list.
Servers are here?

517
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:40,734
- Got them all waiting in the back.
- Excellent.

518
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:43,794
Treat her gently there, boys.
Betty's life was tough enough.

519
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:48,303
Hey, Paris.

520
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,322
- Rory, I clocked in.
- Cool.

521
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:52,324
They gave me this card,
and it had my name on it.

522
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:54,717
And I shoved it in the clock thing,
and it made the punchy sound,

523
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,833
- and I'm officially on the job.
- Great.

524
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:57,747
And I'm prepared, too.

525
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:00,528
I was a little nervous last night about
making small talk with co-workers,

526
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,782
so I went to the video store
and rented "Working girl"

527
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,432
and the first season of "Just shoot me."

528
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:07,500
Got a couple of Wendie Malick bon mots
that have already come in handy.

529
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,054
- Very good. Welcome.
- Thanks, boss.

530
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,139
- I'm gonna welcome the whole group here.
- No problem.

531
00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:15,308
Hello. You must be my servers.

532
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:18,339
I'm Rory Gilmore.
I'm running this little shindig.

533
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:19,627
How are all of you today?

534
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:20,716
- Good.
- Great.

535
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:23,608
You all come highly recommended by Glenda,
our catering manager,

536
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:25,013
so I know you're all top notch.

537
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,516
Yeah, super.

538
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:29,527
Looks like a good group. Good group.

539
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:33,252
Um, you know, you should probably
be standing over with the others.

540
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:36,080
Oh, right. I'm one of them. Got it. Sorry.

541
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:40,663
So it's going to be hard work tonight.
We have 100 people dining with us.

542
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,626
But I want you to have fun, too.

543
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,329
We have your outfits on a rack over here.

544
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,596
Your name should be on them.

545
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:49,583
It's a good cause,
so let's get changed and go do.

546
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:53,527
So, working hard or hardly working?

547
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,495
Oh, my, oh, my.

548
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:56,752
I love it!

549
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:59,007
Thank you.

550
00:20:59,102 --> 00:21:00,201
So where's Luke tonight?

551
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:01,959
As we speak, he's off communing with nature.

552
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,483
- Oh, good for him.
- Yeah.

553
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:06,255
Ooh, the ballerinas are doing "Swan lake."

554
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,669
That always makes me cry.

555
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:11,258
Oh, Patty's packed it all in. Baton twirling,
a modeling exhibition.

556
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:13,387
She's added a couple new features, too.

557
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:14,488
What's krumping?

558
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:17,660
Um, like hip-hop dance, I think,
more herky-jerky.

559
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,277
And what is pubic speaking?

560
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,844
I'm hoping it's a misprint.

561
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,799
I hope so, too.

562
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:27,437
Welcome, everybody, to the 28th-annual
miss Patty's school grand recital.

563
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:31,700
Thank you.
We have a lot on the program tonight.

564
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:37,077
So, without further ado, please welcome my
intermediate pupils as they welcome you.

565
00:21:37,102 --> 00:21:38,370
Hit it, boys.

566
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:42,565
She always does a fun opening number.

567
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,742
- Isn't he cute?
- Darling.

568
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:03,418
Uh-oh, they're in the audience.

569
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:06,351
I hate it when they come into the audience.

570
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:10,082
This is-- this is not good.

571
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:21,321
Oh! Blowing stuff on us!

572
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:34,414
- People seem hungry tonight. Tell...
- ...Glenda to speed the trays up a bit.

573
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,838
- Yeah, and let the sound guy know...
- ...that the drums are a little loud.

574
00:22:36,884 --> 00:22:39,296
- And it's a tad warm.
- Already had them adjust the A.C.

575
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:41,377
- Any incoming choppers, radar?
- Choppers? No.

576
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:43,185
- What do you mean?
- That was a joke, Lacey.

577
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,631
Oh. Sorry.

578
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:46,937
You're a doll.
Remember to have a little fun tonight, too.

579
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:47,462
Will do.

580
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:49,082
Radar-- I get it now.

581
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:51,076
That was funny. I'll be back.

582
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:55,436
- Appetizers?
- Oh, thank you.

583
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:56,458
You're welcome.

584
00:22:57,321 --> 00:22:58,712
So how was that?

585
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,087
Mm, fine, very good.

586
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:01,513
I meant the transaction.

587
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:03,872
I'd love a performance review. Come on.
Be my Dave Navarro.

588
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:05,944
Um, you were fine.

589
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,272
I'm gonna need more.

590
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,334
It was T.S. Eliot who said criticism
is as inevitable as breathing

591
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:12,992
and said that we should be none the worse
for articulating what passes in our mind

592
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:17,739
when we read a book, see a play, or-- now I'm
elaborating-- pass a cheddar and olive ball.

593
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,706
I need some feedback.

594
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,041
Really, you offered it to me well,
and all seemed great,

595
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:22,473
and I don't want to talk about this anymore.

596
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:24,414
Good. Thank you. This has been a help.

597
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,175
Welcome to the Hollywood canteen.

598
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:28,645
Thank you. We're the Gilmores.

599
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:30,312
Richard, look at this place!

600
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,140
It's wonderful.

601
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,521
Here is your table number.

602
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:34,268
And take a pin, both of you.

603
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,234
Oh, thank you.

604
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:36,455
Yes, thank you.

605
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,817
Oh, I love this song.

606
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:41,546
And look at the band-- it's
the Andrews Sisters.

607
00:23:41,596 --> 00:23:43,017
They've kept in pretty good shape.

608
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,177
Hi, guys.

609
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:45,987
Looks like you've got a hit on your hands.

610
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,383
So far, so good.

611
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:48,833
No one's dancing, though.

612
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,093
It's early.
You'll see plenty of dancing after dinner.

613
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,686
You'll see some dancing right now.

614
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:55,421
Richard, it's before dinner!
There's no dancing during appetizers.

615
00:23:55,478 --> 00:23:58,145
Come on,
let's show these fuddy-duddies how it's done.

616
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,271
My father was a huge Benny Goodman fan.

617
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:36,967
Hated Glenn Miller, hated him.

618
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:40,544
Always claimed it wasn't the enemy who shot
down that plane of his, but music lovers.

619
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:42,430
Oh, Richard, that's a horrible thing to say.

620
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,677
It was my father who said it.

621
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:44,884
But you just repeated it.

622
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,678
Here's the woman of the hour.

623
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,733
How's the food, everybody?

624
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:51,472
The macaroni and cheese-- what
an inspiration!

625
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:54,736
Rory, please accept my profound
thanks for serving food

626
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:57,098
at a D.A.R. event which is remarkably edible.

627
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:58,888
Oh, Richard. We always have good food.

628
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:00,430
You have fancy good food.

629
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:04,387
If I never look at another duck's liver for
the rest of my life, I will be a happy man.

630
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:06,722
Rory, could I pull you away
for just a second?

631
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,527
Sure. Excuse me, everybody.

632
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:11,357
She's so poised...

633
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:12,815
like you, Emily.

634
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:17,277
A party's arrived. I'm looking, looking.

635
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:19,295
They did not RSVP,
but they're expecting a table.

636
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:20,588
Oh, great. Where are they?

637
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,750
By the war bonds table.
It's Shira Huntzberger.

638
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,095
She waltzed in with a group of ladies in tow

639
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:26,465
and made it clear she expected
to be accommodated.

640
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:28,106
- Dis she?
- And not very nicely either.

641
00:25:28,157 --> 00:25:29,103
Oh, what a shock.

642
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,296
But you know her, right?
That's your boyfriend's mother.

643
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:32,722
Yeah, yeah, I know her.

644
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:34,724
I didn't mean to insult her before.
She was just very abrupt.

645
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:36,053
I'll take care of it.

646
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,883
- Here's the seating chart.
- Thanks.

647
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:41,940
Hey, boss.

648
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:43,224
It's interesting, you know.

649
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,150
Karl Marx has come alive for me today.

650
00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:47,363
I never understood what he was
yammering about before.

651
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:50,507
Now it just seems so obviously wrong
that those who control capital

652
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:53,517
should make their fortunes off the
labor of the working class.

653
00:25:53,582 --> 00:25:54,361
What's wrong with you?

654
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,587
Shira Huntzberger is here.

655
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:56,267
Logan's mom?

656
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:58,056
And she showed up with no warning,

657
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:01,450
no RSVP,
no donation to the cause that I know of.

658
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:04,072
Just sashayed in,
expecting everyone to fall at her feet.

659
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,701
- I hate that.
- I hate her.

660
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:09,648
Hate-- strong, unadulterated, blind-- ah!

661
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:12,448
Wow. You're always so Desmond Tutu-ey.
This is refreshing.

662
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:17,328
I should tell her to leave. I should
march up to her and tell her to
grab those arrogance-dripping,

663
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,789
petulance-oozing, surgically cosmeticized
bims she brought along and hit the bricks.

664
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,400
I bet they all have money, too--

665
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,480
every one of those commodity fetishists.

666
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:27,233
How can she expect a table?

667
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,804
The tables are for the people
who are polite enough

668
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:32,399
to respond to an invitation
in the proper manner.

669
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:34,607
I bet you the Romanovs never RSVP'd either.

670
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:36,582
They got theirs. Capitalist scum.

671
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:37,459
I hate her.

672
00:26:37,516 --> 00:26:38,493
I hate the rich.

673
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:40,725
A hard rain is gonna fall,
you know what I'm saying?

674
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:41,675
I really hate her!

675
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:42,965
They should die.

676
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:44,626
I should probably give her a table.

677
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:45,525
What?

678
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:48,565
We have a spare table. We kept it open
in case of something like this.

679
00:26:48,611 --> 00:26:49,496
I should give it to her.

680
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:50,528
But she doesn't deserve it.

681
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,496
I know, but this is business.

682
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:53,738
It's not personal.

683
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:54,959
I should give her that table.

684
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:57,361
Fine. Whatever you think. You're the boss.

685
00:26:57,596 --> 00:27:00,756
Hey, boss, how much are you getting
paid in this job of yours?

686
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,280
Mrs. Huntzberger.

687
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:12,279
Rory, hi! What are you doing here?

688
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:13,599
I'm running this event.

689
00:27:13,655 --> 00:27:14,651
I didn't know.

690
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:15,817
Well, now you do.

691
00:27:16,006 --> 00:27:17,279
I think I've been bad.

692
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,505
Oh, really? Why?

693
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:20,274
I just showed up without any warning.

694
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,195
I didn't think I could come,
so I didn't call.

695
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:25,180
Then I could,
and the group and I just came down.

696
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:26,350
It happens.

697
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:28,354
That's what I told that other girl.

698
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:29,724
She was a bit rude.

699
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:31,460
Lacey? I'll talk to her.

700
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:32,689
Could you get us a table?

701
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,868
Of course.

702
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:34,809
It's not a problem?

703
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,026
Not at all. Come with me. It's all set up.

704
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,407
You are the best.

705
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:39,613
It's just my job.

706
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:40,911
So no Logan?

707
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:42,019
Not tonight.

708
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:42,980
Not his thing?

709
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,167
Oh, you know Logan.

710
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:45,214
Here we are.

711
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:46,661
Thank you so much.

712
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:47,811
And you look so pretty.

713
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:49,414
So do you. Have a good time.

714
00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:50,620
I'm sure we will.

715
00:27:57,115 --> 00:28:00,603
You've created a superstar here tonight,
Emily. I hope you know that.

716
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,773
Well, yes, I do.

717
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:04,053
There's already talk of giving her the A.A.

718
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,173
An A.A?

719
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:08,637
An Abigail Adams,
for distinguished service above and beyond.

720
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,712
She deserves it.

721
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,817
She's made this a must-be-at event.

722
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:13,891
I'm guessing that's what brought Shira here.

723
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:14,908
Shira?

724
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,227
Shira Huntzberger's here?

725
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:18,025
Rumsfeld, himself, would probably call her

726
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,561
and thank her for the donation
she made on the way in.

727
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,146
Hillbilly armor will be a thing of the past.

728
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:23,947
Where is she sitting?

729
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:25,611
Up front-- the table by the band.

730
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:26,627
Oh, my god.

731
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:27,557
What?

732
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:29,049
Oh, my god, excuse me.

733
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,826
Rory, where's the seating chart?

734
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:32,801
What? Why?

735
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:34,191
There's been a terrible mistake.

736
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:34,963
What mistake?

737
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:37,294
You sat Shira Huntzberger at the slush table.

738
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,734
It was all that was available.

739
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,492
The slush table is the loser table.

740
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,292
But why would we have a loser table?

741
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,035
It's for people who show up unannounced.

742
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,425
She was unannounced.

743
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:48,481
There's people,
then there's the Huntzbergers.
They cannot sit at the table.

744
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,743
This needs to be rectified.

745
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,753
I don't know what I can do.
Every table is taken.

746
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:53,368
I'll take care of it.
Give me the seating chart.

747
00:28:53,414 --> 00:28:55,029
I'll find someone to bump.
There's always someone to bump.

748
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:56,888
Grandma, it doesn't seem
fair to bump someone.

749
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:00,787
It's not. But if we don't find better
seating for the Huntzbergers,
it'll be a major faux pas,

750
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:04,156
and it may be the only thing people remember
from this otherwise wonderful event.

751
00:29:04,217 --> 00:29:05,674
- Wow.
- Yes.

752
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,162
Well, thank you for helping.
And it's not the Huntzbergers.

753
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,425
What?

754
00:29:09,476 --> 00:29:12,010
You keep saying "the Huntzbergers."
It's only Shira and some friends.

755
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:13,351
- And Mitchum.
- No.

756
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:15,170
Yes. He's right over there.

757
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,959
The Bettertons, perfect!
We'll bump Constance Betterton.
It's a win/win.

758
00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:28,718
- Paris?
- I'm just on my break.

759
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:30,503
You're white as a sheet.

760
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:32,919
I'm having trouble breathing.

761
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:34,535
You're having a panic attack.

762
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,495
I think so.

763
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:37,554
Don't worry. I have these all the time.

764
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,359
- What do I do?
- Well, it depends.

765
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,083
There are different kinds. Does it feel like
an elephant is sitting on your chest?

766
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:42,850
No.

767
00:29:42,926 --> 00:29:45,855
Does your chest feel like an overinflated
balloon with a slow leak?

768
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:47,061
Not really.

769
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:49,688
Sharp needles, intermittently poking
into your left ventricle?

770
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:52,591
I don't know from ventricles,
but there is a needle thing.

771
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:53,680
You need diazepam.

772
00:29:53,746 --> 00:29:55,739
50-- no, 100 milligrams. I'll get my purse.

773
00:29:55,842 --> 00:29:58,050
No, wait. I don't want any diazepam.

774
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:00,937
Well, what do you want?
Fluoxetine, protriptyline?

775
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:02,582
I have others floating around
the bottom of my purse.

776
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:06,186
I have no idea what they are,
but popping a few can't hurt.
Pretty hot grab bag.

777
00:30:06,396 --> 00:30:10,569
These people-- those people,
they didn't even RSVP.

778
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:13,781
That's not right. This is for our boys.
They need to make a donation.

779
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:15,213
Tough night for you, huh?

780
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:18,457
Shira's one thing. I can deal with her.
But Mitchum?

781
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:21,529
I can't see him. I can't face him.

782
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,947
It's too much, after what he did,
what he said to me.

783
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:25,868
What did he say to you?

784
00:30:25,928 --> 00:30:27,764
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have--

785
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,040
You wouldn't have what?

786
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:30,407
Rory?

787
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:32,173
Nothing, nothing.

788
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:33,703
He's just--

789
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,037
they're just not the nicest people.

790
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,287
Well, the rich never are,
because they don't have to be.

791
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:42,207
When you control the means of production,
it reduces the incentive to humanize workers.

792
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,400
- Capitalist system--
- I haven't eaten all day.

793
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:46,781
I think I should eat. That's my problem.

794
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:48,646
Sure, boss, go eat.

795
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:51,013
There's probably somewhere
else where you eat, right?

796
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,398
Special room.

797
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:09,611
It's just so damn beautiful.

798
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:11,809
I know, honey.

799
00:31:21,938 --> 00:31:24,725
The Patty ballerinas, everybody.

800
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:31,588
Now I would like to introduce a special
new segment of my annual recital

801
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:34,792
entitled "it was 20 years ago today."

802
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:37,446
One of our local townsmen is
going to re-create an act

803
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:41,077
that he performed on this
very stage 20 years ago.

804
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:47,094
This young man was a talented pupil
of my wonderful dancing
skills and a genius tumbler.

805
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:50,359
He once did 98 somersaults in
a row without throwing up.

806
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:53,705
But that's nothing compared
with his talent for mime.

807
00:31:53,754 --> 00:31:59,968
Here to present a piece of his own creation
entitled "the journey of man"

808
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,006
exactly as he performed it 20 years ago is...

809
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:04,956
Kirk!

810
00:32:10,776 --> 00:32:13,420
It's moments like these that
make life worth living.

811
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:26,775
- Ew.
- Ew.

812
00:32:35,602 --> 00:32:36,888
- Ew!
- Ew!

813
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:46,640
So it's the birth of Lucille Ball?

814
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:02,770
He's a parent now, I get that.

815
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:05,734
He's moving along at a nice clip.

816
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,121
I'll be right back.

817
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:16,314
I'll catch you up when you return.

818
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:31,967
Hey, Grizzly Adams.

819
00:33:32,294 --> 00:33:33,879
Why are you back?
The woods closed or something?

820
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:36,053
No, they weren't closed. I was--

821
00:33:36,863 --> 00:33:39,823
I don't know. It's... what it is.

822
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:41,378
- Nature.
- Nature?

823
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:43,212
Nature is...

824
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:47,168
You know, it's there,
I saw it-- trees, leaves, whatever.

825
00:33:47,214 --> 00:33:51,021
That's your second answer in the form
of a haiku. Let's get beyond
that. Why are you back?

826
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:54,005
Because I felt like coming back.
I can't do what I want to do?

827
00:33:54,078 --> 00:33:55,213
- Of course you can.
- Good.

828
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,934
But camping is something you want to do.

829
00:33:56,985 --> 00:33:58,595
No, it's what you wanted me to do.

830
00:33:58,652 --> 00:33:59,956
When did you turn against camping?

831
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:01,783
I didn't turn against camping.

832
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:06,969
I'm just trying to understand why you
were trying to get rid of me tonight.

833
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,097
I wasn't doing that.

834
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:09,604
You sent me off to the woods.

835
00:34:09,661 --> 00:34:11,419
What if I dot want to go off to the woods?

836
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,782
You always want to go to the woods.

837
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:15,293
I don't like going to the woods when
I'm being banished to them.

838
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,167
- No one is banishing you.
- It felt like it.

839
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,077
Well, then, that's my fault.

840
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:26,250
Look... I like doing things with you.

841
00:34:26,343 --> 00:34:27,824
Surprised I have to tell you that.

842
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:28,958
You don't have to tell me that.

843
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:33,466
I like going shopping with you,
I like having dinner with Sookie and Jackson.

844
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:37,135
The actual shopping seems a little pointless,

845
00:34:37,198 --> 00:34:41,797
and Sookie's kids drive me up a wall,
but you're there,
and I like hanging with you.

846
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:42,564
I know that.

847
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,542
And I could have been fun at this recital.

848
00:34:45,604 --> 00:34:47,839
You're probably sitting there
mocking most of it.

849
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,039
I can mock stuff.

850
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,332
Oh, you're a great mocker.

851
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:52,535
I was only thinking of you when
I mentioned the camping.

852
00:34:52,597 --> 00:34:56,521
You haven't been camping since we got
together, and I was feeling weird about that.

853
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:58,786
You should do the things you like.

854
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,370
I do do the things I like.

855
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:04,618
I wasn't getting rid of you. I want you
to do whatever you want to do with me.

856
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:08,559
I know that sounded dirty.
And dirty things count,
but I didn't mean the dirty things.

857
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,390
You and me can hang whenever, wherever.

858
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,423
Yeah, well, maybe I'm being sensitive.

859
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:15,121
I really wasn't getting rid of you.

860
00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:18,513
I mean, I'm not dying to see baton twirling.

861
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:20,165
I'm happy to be with a man who isn't.

862
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,226
Was there baton twirling?

863
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,425
Oh, yes, and it was no fun.
She didn't drop it once.

864
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:27,053
You want to come back to the recital with me?

865
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:29,195
Kirk is doing something
strange and disturbing.

866
00:35:29,302 --> 00:35:32,184
No, I think I might go back out camping.

867
00:35:32,251 --> 00:35:33,596
Wouldn't mind doing some fishing.

868
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:34,315
Good.

869
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:35,349
Yeah.

870
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:36,964
- Good.
- Okay.

871
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,068
Excuse me. Thank you.

872
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:49,138
Kirk's dying.

873
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:50,062
Oh.

874
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:54,668
Well, it's gonna happen to all of us one day.

875
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:00,591
Just not so spazzy.

876
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:23,313
And that's our show, everybody,
and I think it was the best one ever!

877
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:27,551
From all of us at the miss Patty school,
we thank you.

878
00:36:34,156 --> 00:36:35,137
They're back!

879
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:38,877
Okay. Oh, wow!

880
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:41,452
You'd think they would have
run out of glitter by now.

881
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:43,062
This is so stressful!

882
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:49,557
Richard.

883
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:52,231
Oh, Mitchum, old boy.
I didn't know you were out there.

884
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:54,787
Just got here.
It's quite the affair we got going here.

885
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,284
And for a wonderful cause.

886
00:36:56,432 --> 00:36:58,707
Not stuffy like the others,
no smell of mothballs.

887
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:00,521
Oh you know,
my granddaughter is responsible for it.

888
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:01,322
Oh yeah?

889
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:02,264
Planned the whole thing.

890
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,021
That's nice. I didn't know that.
She's a sweet kid.

891
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:04,866
The sweetest.

892
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:06,966
Yeah. I wish Rory nothing but the best.

893
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,990
I came straight from work without
looking in a mirror.

894
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,029
Wish I had.

895
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,709
Mitchum, just out of curiosity,
what happened with all of that?

896
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:16,715
All of what?

897
00:37:16,962 --> 00:37:21,614
Uh, that paper of yours in
Stanford-- something apparently
got blown out of proportion.

898
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:22,937
There was some misunderstanding.

899
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:24,889
Oh, it was nothing much. She's a great kid.

900
00:37:24,945 --> 00:37:28,681
She is. And a great journalist-- I've read
things she's written. She's a talent.

901
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:30,624
Maybe.

902
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:33,138
What do you mean "maybe"?

903
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:35,719
Well, I worked with her, Richard.
I read her stuff, too.

904
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,552
Meaning?

905
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:38,133
I've read great. I know what great is.

906
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,393
When I said great,
I didn't mean she was Ben Bradley yet,
but she could be.

907
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:45,046
Anything's possible.

908
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:48,680
What exactly happened at that paper, Mitchum?

909
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:50,817
It didn't work out, Richard.
It was just one of those things.

910
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:52,581
She's better off for what I did.

911
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:54,267
And what exactly did you do?

912
00:37:54,328 --> 00:37:55,631
Nothing you wouldn't have done.

913
00:37:55,768 --> 00:37:57,210
And what was that?

914
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:59,402
You're in the business world.
You have employees, yes?

915
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:00,164
Of course.

916
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:02,919
Say you got a guy working in your office,
you brought him in.

917
00:38:02,985 --> 00:38:06,236
Nice guy, everybody loves him,
but he just doesn't have it.

918
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:08,433
He's a drain on the company.
What are you gonna do?

919
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,933
My granddaughter was not
a drain on your company.

920
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:15,390
My point is that I wasn't going to put
her in a position to become a drain.

921
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,775
Now, Richard, really,
we should get back out there.

922
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:18,982
What did you say to her?

923
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:20,730
- Richard--
- What did you say to her, Mitchum?

924
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:23,141
I did what I do with everyone.
I called it like I saw it.

925
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:26,188
I was honest with her. I don't pussyfoot.
You know that.

926
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:27,323
You crushed her.

927
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:30,001
And if she's got what it takes,
she'll bounce back.

928
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,946
No one's every criticized you,
reprimanded you, critiqued you?

929
00:38:32,992 --> 00:38:34,085
I find that hard to believe.

930
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:35,184
This is not about me.

931
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:36,246
She was in over her head.

932
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:37,233
She lacked maturity.

933
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:38,444
She's not even 21!

934
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:40,857
Look, just blame me, okay?

935
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:44,582
I felt bad that she had to sit through that
disastrous dinner with Shira and pop

936
00:38:44,643 --> 00:38:47,618
going on about marriage and how
she can't become a Huntzberger.

937
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:51,226
I don't care about any of that,
so I gave her a shot,
and she wasn't up to it.

938
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:52,438
You crushed that girl!

939
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:53,905
I did what I do.

940
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:57,910
We should have done this on the phone.

941
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,424
Richard, there you are.
This is one of your favorites,
and you're missing it.

942
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,819
It's all true, all of it.

943
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:13,601
What's true?

944
00:39:13,662 --> 00:39:14,925
Everything she told us. Everything.

945
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:16,719
- Everything who told us?
- Lorelai--

946
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:19,602
About what Mitchum did to Rory,
how he said things to her,

947
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:21,613
crushed her, about Logan's whole family!

948
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:22,351
That can't be.

949
00:39:22,412 --> 00:39:24,523
Mitchum just confirmed everything.

950
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,271
He told that girl she wasn't good enough.

951
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:27,258
I ought to punch him!

952
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:28,994
Richard, calm down. People will hear.

953
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:32,205
They don't want her marrying into
their precious family. They
don't think she's good enough.

954
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:34,159
He told her that she didn't have it.

955
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:35,747
And you know she does! I know she does!

956
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:36,877
Of course she does.

957
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:38,533
I can't stay in this room with these people.

958
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,275
Richard, go outside, get some air.

959
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:41,164
We should go home.

960
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:43,612
- I'll catch up with you. Go outside.
- Yeah, yeah.

961
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,788
- Emily!
- Hello, Shira.

962
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,293
I'm here to rescue you. I've got a table
for you and Mitchum right in the center.

963
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:11,839
Oh, bless you, Emily. I'm undeserving.

964
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,613
Nonsense. It was a terrible mistake,
and it must be rectified.

965
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:16,107
Aren't they amazing?

966
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,413
The whole combo is amazing. Follow me.

967
00:40:18,513 --> 00:40:23,477
Me, I love the Beatles. Mitchum
took me to see Paul McCartney
last year, and I almost died.

968
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:27,534
So Richard tells me we have a little problem.

969
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:28,925
Really? With what?

970
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:31,216
With the kids-- Logan, Rory.

971
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,469
I understand you're not exactly
thrilled with the match,

972
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:36,381
that you let that be known to Rory at
the dinner she had at your house.

973
00:40:36,453 --> 00:40:39,254
Oh, well, I wouldn't say "not thrilled."

974
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:40,414
Then what would you say?

975
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:42,222
Oh, Emily, this is a party.

976
00:40:42,284 --> 00:40:43,501
I'm just curious.

977
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:46,594
This may not be the time and place, Emily.

978
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,796
Hello, you two, drop by our table later.

979
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,723
Let's make it the time and place.

980
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,665
Consider the discrepancies, Emily.

981
00:40:52,737 --> 00:40:54,110
That's what's confusing me.

982
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:56,789
They both come from good families,
both have good values.

983
00:40:56,865 --> 00:40:58,921
Money doesn't seem to be an issue.
We all have money.

984
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:01,276
Frankly, Emily, there's your money,
then there's our money.

985
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:01,885
Oh?

986
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:05,191
And our family has a lot of responsibilities
that come with that,

987
00:41:05,273 --> 00:41:06,454
an image to maintain.

988
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:10,389
Ah yes. Let me tell you this,
Shira-- we are just as good as you are.

989
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:13,628
You don't think Rory is good enough for your
son, as if we don't know Logan's reputation.

990
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:16,109
We do. But he is welcome in our home anytime,

991
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,296
and you should extend the
same courtesy to Rory.

992
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:20,876
- Emily--
- Now let's talk about your money.

993
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:24,458
You were a two-bit gold digger,
fresh off the bus from Hicksville

994
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:27,566
when you met Mitchum at whatever bar
you happened to stumble into.

995
00:41:27,623 --> 00:41:29,817
And what made Mitchum decide
to choose you to marry

996
00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:32,442
amongst the pack of women he was bedding
at the time, I'll never know.

997
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:34,401
But hats off to you for bagging him.

998
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:35,902
He's still a playboy, you know?

999
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:37,440
Of course you know. That would explain

1000
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:40,139
why your weight goes up and down
30 pounds every other month.

1001
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:41,656
But that's your cross to bear.

1002
00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:44,963
But these are ugly realities.
No one needs to talk about them.

1003
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:48,026
Those kids are staying together
for as long as they like.

1004
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:49,440
You won't stop them.

1005
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,964
Now, enjoy the event.

1006
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:54,030
Diane, hello.

1007
00:42:02,948 --> 00:42:05,013
The Swing Dolls, everybody.

1008
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:13,017
I'm Rory Gilmore,
the architect of this event.

1009
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:16,452
Thank you.

1010
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:21,992
And I'd like to take this moment to thank
some others for the outstanding
success this evening.

1011
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:27,261
To Lacey Boscombe, my right hand,
my girl Friday,
I could not have done it without you.

1012
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:30,812
To Glenda, Lance, the entire serving crew,
thank you...
