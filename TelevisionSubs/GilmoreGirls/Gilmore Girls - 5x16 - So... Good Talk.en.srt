1
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:47,553
Thanks, Skip! Love that you’re back in shorts.

2
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,136
Missed those stems of yours, baby.

3
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,624
Now, come on.

4
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,556
Hello?

5
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:03,718
Yeah, we’ve got to talk mail.

6
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:04,527
Not again.

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,231
It’s all for you. Every piece.

8
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:08,485
How can that be? You only half live here.

9
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:10,344
This mail envy of yours is not pretty.

10
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:13,497
Catalogues, business solicitations, credit card offers.

11
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,040
Oh! And for me, some more stupid Greenpeace return address labels.

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,400
Well, you are the environmental philanthropist in the family.

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,780
Well, I feel very badly for the planet right now.

14
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:23,148
Hey, you called my cell.

15
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:23,723
I know.

16
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,355
Well, I told you to call my land line. My cell phone bill is astronomical.

17
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,797
But a conversation with me, priceless.

18
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:30,047
Oh, joy.

19
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:30,655
What?

20
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,543
Well, I did get a piece of mail. The temple of Apollo.

21
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:35,146
Grandma still hitting you with the postcards, huh?

22
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:38,167
As if nothing even remotely unpleasant happened between us.

23
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:41,858
How does she do that? Compartmentalize like that? It’s weird.

24
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:45,243
She’s the serial killer who goes to work and talks about a funny Seinfeld he saw

25
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:47,505
and then goes home and cooks himself a man-flesh sandwich.

26
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:48,141
Ew.

27
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,763
Let’s see how her trip has been since the last card.

28
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:55,104
Dear Lorelai, kicked a dog then punched a gypsy in the groin. Oh, that’s nice.

29
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:55,837
Mom –

30
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:58,596
Complained about the foie gras to a waiter whose yearly pay

31
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,388
is less than I spend monthly on silver polish, then kicked another dog.

32
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:02,124
Come on.

33
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,105
Tripped a nun, then burned down an orphanage.

34
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:05,499
Sounds like a busy itinerary.

35
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,053
And the sun sets on Apollo.

36
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,489
At least you don’t get the nothing said all about it reminders about Friday night dinner.

37
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:13,015
She’s putting her hooks in you, huh?

38
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:17,015
Yeah, three cards in a row, reminding me in no uncertain terms that they’ll see me soon.

39
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:18,858
Well, she’s smart enough not to do that to me.

40
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,835
Well, I’m mad at her too, you know. Just for the record.

41
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:21,638
I know.

42
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,626
Anything else?

43
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:24,991
Whoa. One minute of talk, and then I get the bum’s rush?

44
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:26,288
I’m right in the middle of studying.

45
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,796
I gotta pop out of an envelope for you to have an interest in me?

46
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:31,806
I’ll be home Friday. We’ll eat, we’ll talk, we’ll laugh. What a time we’ll have.

47
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:32,942
Skip’s back in shorts.

48
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:35,626
I am not wasting cell phone minutes on Skip’s shorts!

49
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:38,728
It’s the Reno 911 short shorts. Ooh, disturbing.

50
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:39,706
I’m hanging up now.

51
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:40,660
Fine. So Friday?

52
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:41,428
Friday. Bye.

53
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:42,312
Bye-bye.

54
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:48,696
- Sit up.
- Huh?

55
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,803
Sit up and feet off the chair.

56
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:51,574
What’s with being a Chilean dictator dude?

57
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,991
Luke is on a tear, so this is for your own protection.

58
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:55,102
He’s always on a tear.

59
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,275
This is different! And you have to pay today.

60
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:59,814
For the ice-cold, undercooked fries? I don’t think so.

61
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,781
Zach, please!

62
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:01,595
Ow!

63
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,739
I do this because I care for you. You know I care for you, right?

64
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:05,687
Yeah.

65
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:07,027
Gosh.

66
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,148
Excuse me, miss?

67
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,065
Can I help you?

68
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:12,635
Sorry to be a pest, but I asked for my omelette soft. This is way overdone.

69
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:13,837
Shh. Not so loud.

70
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:15,307
You should probably make me another –

71
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,185
How’s everyone else’s eggs, huh?

72
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,399
Great.

73
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,241
That’s all I’ve got, man.

74
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:32,547
His eyes. Red, like the fires of Mordor.

75
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,933
Go, go. I’ll see you later, and keep low!

76
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,939
How are you doing, Kirk?

77
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:40,452
Great. I’m loving this blackened Cajun bread Luke made for me.

78
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:41,635
I didn’t even ask for it.

79
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:43,586
That’s burnt toast, Kirk. You don’t have to eat it.

80
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:45,230
But I’m loving it! And look.

81
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:48,666
I’ve been mixing blackened ash with the runny eggs.

82
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:50,826
Goes great with the fishy tasting bacon.

83
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,434
- Glad you like it.
- Order’s up!

84
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:56,270
Uh, Luke?

85
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:57,041
What?

86
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:59,652
Um, I know you’re really busy back there –

87
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,198
Is that the door to the oven?

88
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:03,048
It fell off when I kicked it. Something wrong?

89
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:07,887
Well, I needed a side of hash browns for table three, and I’m really, really sorry, but this is hash.

90
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:09,971
- I think. I mean, it’s hash-like.
- They’ll eat it.

91
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,172
They might, or they might go have breakfast at Weston’s

92
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:14,437
like the lady with the walker you threw out about an hour ago.

93
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:17,237
So, let ‘em go to Weston’s. Huh?

94
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:22,388
All of you! If you can eat ceramic cow creamers and kitty cat salt and pepper shakers

95
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,016
and stupid little flowers drawn in powdered sugar on your plate,

96
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:28,829
then that’s where you belong anyway!

97
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:36,145
Unidentified breakfast food, on the house?

98
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:36,995
Terriff.

99
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:40,114
No, I don’t understand.

100
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,837
Well, yes, of course I’ll hold. I thought you’d never ask.

101
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:45,645
- How’s your reservation book looking?
- What?

102
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:47,857
Are we booked up, half full, kinda light?

103
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:48,373
For when?

104
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,551
Next two to three months.

105
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:52,346
Um, we’re fairly booked. I’d say eighty, ninety percent.

106
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:54,414
Eighty, ninety percent! Now, did they seem hungry?

107
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:55,289
What?

108
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:57,200
Oh, and where are they from? Any from Jersey?

109
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,980
People from Jersey love my Chinese chicken salad. Any Texans?

110
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:01,563
Oh, any from France?

111
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:04,384
Yes, I’m still here. Yes, great.

112
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,361
What’s the panic, Sookie?

113
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:07,089
- What’s the panic? I’m giving birth!
- Right now?

114
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:11,537
No, not right now, but eventually. And when I do, I’ll have to have all the menus made out,

115
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:15,086
and a food order put in, and a backup plan, in case there’s a bad tomato crop,

116
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:17,518
or if Oprah decides to get mad at beef again.

117
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:22,447
Hello, Blaine! Yes, you were about to explain to me the reason you once again raised our premium here.

118
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,711
Uh-huh. Those were all very small claims due to the snow, and – right.

119
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:32,890
Well, who else would we come to, but our trusty insurance agent. Guy. Stud.

120
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,608
Pick the appropriate term and insert here. Now.

121
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:39,330
Eh – yes, well, of course. Holding’s one of my great pleasures.

122
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:39,913
Problem?

123
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,920
The charmers at our insurance agency get mad when you try to claim something.

124
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:43,728
The stable roof.

125
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:47,537
Yes, and – and now I’ve been disconnected. Coincidence? I think not.

126
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,770
- Have people made dinner reservations?
- Be my guest.

127
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:52,965
Dragonfly Inn, Lorelai speaking.

128
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:54,635
Lorelai, it’s your mother, I –

129
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,772
Hey, we’ve got vegetarians in April! What, were you hiding them?

130
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,006
Yes, I’m evil that way.

131
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,078
Dragonfly Inn, Lorelai speaking.

132
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:04,317
Lorelai, you just hung up –

133
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,512
Hey, so who do you think will take over while you’re gone?

134
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,736
I was thinking about Chantelle.

135
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,298
The one who got her face caught in the mixer?

136
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:12,826
She’s better now. She just got her new nostril last week.

137
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:13,620
That’s good.

138
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:16,524
Dragonfly Inn.

139
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:20,333
Ah, yes. Lorelai. It’s your father.

140
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,555
Oh, Dad! How was your trip?

141
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,711
Fine, Lorelai. Thank you very much.

142
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:26,007
And the flight back?

143
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:26,953
Very smooth.

144
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,260
Smooth is good.

145
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,960
Actually, your mother wanted to talk to you for a moment.

146
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,200
Hello, Lorelai, I –

147
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:41,249
Hey, do you have any of that really great braised lamb risotto thing leftover from last night?

148
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,052
I think so, why?

149
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,161
Well, since I’m not going to Friday night dinner tonight or ever again,

150
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:48,069
and I’m not in the mood for pizza, I thought I’d have a little fancy food with my movie.

151
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,304
You’re going to a movie!

152
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:51,895
I Netflixed all three ‘A Star is Born’s.

153
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:53,246
Janet, Judy and Babs.

154
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:57,014
The holy trinity. I thought I’d hunker down with some fabulous food

155
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,643
and watch all the men that got away.

156
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:00,230
What? No, you can’t do that!

157
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:00,819
Why not?

158
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:03,496
Because! Look, I’m worried about you.

159
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:04,183
Why?

160
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,753
Just because you don’t have someone in your life right now –

161
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:07,480
Meaning Luke.

162
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,747
And your parents, and your Friday night dinners, and Rory’s off at college –

163
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,754
I do, however, have my original nostril.

164
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,237
You can’t use that as an excuse to become couch potato girl.

165
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,188
What are you talking about?

166
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:20,389
Sitting at home. Ordering take-out. Watching television night after night.

167
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,819
That’s what I’ve always done. I was couch potato girl even when I had a guy.

168
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,993
And Friday night dinner. And, by the way, the entire time Rory was growing up.

169
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:28,560
Yes, but now it’s pathetic.

170
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:29,875
Well, just a little.

171
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:32,349
You are not sitting home tonight! We are going out!

172
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:33,137
We are?

173
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,990
Girl’s night out, just you and me. Oh, it’ll be fun. Big excitement, big hair!

174
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,087
We’ll get all dolled up and paint the town!

175
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:39,569
But –

176
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,170
I am coming to your house tonight, at seven o’clock sharp,

177
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:45,093
and I am taking you out, and you better look hot! You hear me?

178
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:46,593
- Yes I do.
- Good.

179
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:49,123
But remember, I don’t put out unless I get dinner.

180
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:50,883
I know. I saw your bumper sticker.

181
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:57,535
Hi. I'd like a large caramel macchiato with an extra shot and whip cream, please.

182
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,078
Coming up.

183
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:00,207
Wait, hold on. How much is that?

184
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:00,997
Four eighty-five.

185
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,835
Okay, better drop the extra shot. What does that make it?

186
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:03,676
Four twenty.

187
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:05,416
Better make it a small. What does that make it?

188
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:06,123
Three thirty.

189
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,475
Better drop the whip cream. What does that make it?

190
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:08,438
Less calories.

191
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:11,115
Just a plain old small coffee, please.

192
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,259
D'oh.

193
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:19,323
This would definitely qualify as a cute meet if we hadn't already met.

194
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:21,816
Logan. Hey. This is nice and embarassing.

195
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,951
Are we going after the rollers? A couple of them are headed into the bushes.

196
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:28,155
No, I think I've supplied people with a sufficient amount of silly images of me for one day.

197
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,515
Small coffee for me, and put the lady's on my tab too.

198
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:31,990
No, Logan, you don't have to do that.

199
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:34,852
Ace, I can't take a chance of you pulling out that purse again. Someone might get hurt.

200
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:36,583
Okay, well, thank you.

201
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,076
So I stopped by the paper the other day to see you.

202
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:39,866
Really?

203
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,471
And then I tried to sneak out when I realized you weren't there.

204
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:46,044
But our omnipresent editor cornered me. Does Doyle ever leave that place?

205
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:49,348
Unfortunately yes, otherwise I would be denied the regular pleasure

206
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:52,157
of seeing him in Property of Alcatraz pajama pants.

207
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,208
Thanks for the image.

208
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,217
Hey, come here.

209
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:55,215
What are you doing?

210
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:00,531
So that's what you're doing.

211
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:01,775
What'd you think I was doing?

212
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:06,347
People will see.

213
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:07,361
I don't care if people see.

214
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:10,731
A professor will see you, and he'll take advantage of the fact that you're distracted

215
00:10:10,797 --> 00:10:12,317
and pull you in, make you take a midterm.

216
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:13,284
I'm done with them.

217
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:13,976
With your midterms?

218
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,491
I already took the ones I couldn't get out of.

219
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,242
Then why are you here? You're going off skiing, aren't you?

220
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:20,520
I just have to drop off a paper for my ethics class by eleven thirty and then I'm off.

221
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:21,876
It's eleven twenty-five.

222
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,403
So we're swimming in time.

223
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:27,688
What are you doing?

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,953
I want to see your paper.

225
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:30,608
Your mind is a mysterious thing.

226
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:33,981
Come on. I'm dying to know what your take on ethics is. For instance, are you for it or against it?

227
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,137
No way. It's too dangerous.

228
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:35,983
Dangerous?

229
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:38,640
I actually worked on this thing. It goes from my hand to the professor’s.

230
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:39,823
Like I'm going to lose it.

231
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:42,434
I saw you with your coins, plus let's remember Hemingway.

232
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:43,444
What about him?

233
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:47,176
Trusted that wife of his with the only copy he had of the novel he was working on. The silly woman lost it.

234
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:50,714
Not so. I know the story. Hemingway left it on a plane.

235
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:52,265
His wife had nothing to do with it.

236
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:53,842
- That's not the way I heard it.
- Well, you heard it wrong.

237
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:54,651
How much you want to bet?

238
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,536
All the money in my purse, plus a million dollars.

239
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,962
Well, my spelling stinks. Take my word for it.

240
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:02,972
You'll call me from the cabin?

241
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:03,910
Absolutely.

242
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:04,974
Thanks for the coffee.

243
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:05,737
Anytime.

244
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:08,988
Better have that million bucks ready when I get back, and I don't accept coins.

245
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:10,070
No promises.

246
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:14,176
Hello!

247
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:15,093
Kitchen!

248
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:16,975
Ow! Rat bastard!

249
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,748
- Are you okay?
- Give me a hand!

250
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,955
Okay, Bob Hope’s laughing in heaven, but I’m not.

251
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:24,108
Bob Hope got into heaven?

252
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:25,015
Please grab a bag.

253
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,228
This cannot all be laundry.

254
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,019
It’s all laundry. The machine’s fixed, right?

255
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,183
Yes, humming like new. Which one’s the rat bastard?

256
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:30,816
That one.

257
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:32,059
Take that! And that!

258
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:34,692
Okay, he’s had enough! I want to get a load going before I go to Grandma’s.

259
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:35,542
Good idea.

260
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,083
- Hey, you’re using it!
- Yes, I know.

261
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,696
- Well, but I had dibs.
- No, you didn’t call dibs.

262
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:45,147
I’m a college student coming home on Spring Break.

263
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:47,077
That implies dibs on the washer and drier.

264
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:50,411
There’s no implied dibs in dibs. If you don’t call it, you don’t get it.

265
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,723
- Well, this is just wrong!
- What?

266
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,284
You’re washing two socks!

267
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:57,862
- Well, they were dirty.
- That’s wasteful.

268
00:11:57,933 --> 00:11:59,618
I really wanted to wear them tonight.

269
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:03,703
They are your dancing Santa Claus socks. You’re not going to wear those for another ten months.

270
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,448
No, I can wear them eccentrically any time I want!

271
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,936
Well, then you’re going to have to put one of my loads I while I’m gone.

272
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:09,908
And risk a hernia?

273
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,604
I’ll never finish otherwise!

274
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,181
I’ll do two loads. How’s that?

275
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:14,953
Thank you. All right, I’ve got to take off.

276
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:17,809
Okay. Drive safe, and you’ve got gas, right?

277
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,668
Yeah, I’ve got gas.

278
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,569
Okay. Enough gas to get to Hartford?

279
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,994
I think so. Why?

280
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:25,009
Oh, well, because I’ve got a twenty – ah! A twenty!

281
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:26,658
On the fridge, here! Look!

282
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:29,853
Oh, here it is. I’m not going to use it. You should use it for gas.

283
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,106
Is it that obvious I’m broke?

284
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:34,040
Well, you mentioned the minutes on your cell phone, a hint of panic in your voice,

285
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:36,216
and now the months of saved up laundry.

286
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:39,125
Well, there are just no good jobs at Yale right now, and I’d take anything. Trust me.

287
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:43,324
Well, I took the liberty of asking around town for you. Made you sound all pathetic and ragged.

288
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,851
And there are a few temporary things you could take.

289
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:47,599
You are very in demand in Stars Hollow.

290
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:48,341
Like what?

291
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:52,201
Well, the radio station needs someone to drive up the hill a couple of times a day

292
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:54,092
and shoo the cows away from the transmitter.

293
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:55,398
I’m not good with livestock.

294
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:59,467
Well, the road crew needs a part-time ‘Slow Down’ sign holder-upper.

295
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,460
- You get to wear a helmet.
- I don’t think so.

296
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:06,150
I saved the best for last. Andrew needs help doing inventory at the bookstore.

297
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:08,409
I think that’s probably your best bet.

298
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:09,909
That sounds great, actually.

299
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:11,454
- Cool, just give him a ring.
- Thanks.

300
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:13,687
Now I just need to borrow some clothes to wear to Grandma’s.

301
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:14,500
You’re in clothes.

302
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:17,912
Well, she’ll insist I take my jacket off and I’m down to my ‘Give Bush a Wedgie’ t-shirt.

303
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,187
Please wear that to Grandma’s!

304
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,061
I’m going to borrow some clothes.

305
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:22,490
There’s another twenty in it for you!

306
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:23,625
Start one of my loads.

307
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:25,786
Forty if you snap a picture of her seeing it!

308
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:26,989
Finish your socks!

309
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:33,538
Rory, hello! Come in!

310
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:34,285
Hi, Grandma.

311
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,665
Oh, we missed you.

312
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:38,167
It’s only been a few weeks, Grandma.

313
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:39,569
Give your coat to Eliza.

314
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:41,793
That’s an interesting outfit you have on.

315
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:42,652
Laundry day.

316
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,509
Laundry day. Everything young people do sounds like fun to me.

317
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:46,892
No, it’s pretty dreary.

318
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,705
Well, come in. Come in.

319
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:51,392
Richard, Rory’s here.

320
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:54,122
Hurry down, and don’t forget to bring the you-know-what!

321
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,226
- Forget you heard that.
- Consider it forgotten.

322
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:59,436
Our trip was wonderful. We have so much to tell you.

323
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:00,153
Good.

324
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:02,642
We’ll have to wait ‘till next week to show you pictures.

325
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:06,897
Richard bought this new digital camera that’s supposed to be so simple a child can use it.

326
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:09,159
So now we need to find a child who’ll show us how.

327
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:12,611
Are you feeling okay?

328
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:13,675
I’m feeling fine.

329
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:16,589
So, did you go to Athens on that first big European trip of yours?

330
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:17,609
Um, yeah.

331
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,450
I hope you saw the National Archaeological museum.

332
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:24,264
I thought of you there the whole time. The room with the Mask of Agamemnon?

333
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:25,129
Yep, we hit that.

334
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:26,082
Interesting, huh?

335
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:26,752
Yep.

336
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:27,515
Rory!

337
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:29,429
Grandpa! Welcome home!

338
00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:30,439
Well, thank you!

339
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,979
Look at this outfit! I like the colors.

340
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:34,219
Thanks! It’s borrowed.

341
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:36,087
So, we have quite a bit to catch up on!

342
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:38,339
I know, I want to hear all about it!

343
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,235
Well, I’m sure your grandmother has caught you up somewhat.

344
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,116
I started to.

345
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:44,525
And with the dozens of postcards she sent, you probably remember the trip better than I do.

346
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,835
I still want to hear your account.

347
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,106
Have her open the gift, Richard.

348
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:48,907
Oh, yes. Please. Open it!

349
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,958
Oh, my God, it’s amazing!

350
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,759
Leaves of Grass in Greek.

351
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:57,124
A hundred years old, some beautiful engravings.

352
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,217
Now I have to learn Greek.

353
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,247
Feel the leather.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:00,756
Grandpa, thank you so much.

355
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:02,908
Well, you can thank your grandmother. She helped pick it out.

356
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:03,957
Thank you, Grandma.

357
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:05,698
Dinner is served, Mrs. Gilmore.

358
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:08,339
Thank you Eliza. You can flip through that a little later.

359
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:09,768
Okay.

360
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:14,708
So, Grandpa, is it true that every restaurant in the Placa has a view of the Acropolis?

361
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,152
Well, they like to think so.

362
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:19,045
But we found this charming little taverna – Dionysus.

363
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:23,429
The view was spectacular, and the Ouzo certainly lived up to its name.

364
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:37,996
Oh, I am so hot. I’m going to hit on myself tonight.

365
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:38,948
You look nice.

366
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:40,684
So do you, your hair is so fancy.

367
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,061
And I’m ready to let it down!

368
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:44,268
So, what town are we painting first?

369
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,316
Oh, well, it’s your big night out, so anywhere you want!

370
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:48,237
Okay. How about dancing?

371
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,778
Dancing! Yes!

372
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:53,075
I’m a brick – da-da-da-da - house.

373
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:56,572
Now, of course I can’t really dance ‘cause my ankles are completely swollen,

374
00:15:56,665 --> 00:16:00,541
and, uh, my stomach’s a bit of a hindrance on the dance floor. But I can watch you dance.

375
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,369
No, that’s okay. Let’s do something else!

376
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:03,531
But you want to go dancing!

377
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:04,472
No, we’ll do whatever.

378
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:05,165
Like what?

379
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:06,889
We can go to a bar, hang out and talk.

380
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:08,131
Sounds perfect!

381
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:13,351
Of course, I tend to get a little depressed when I’m in a room full of people drinking and I can’t have a cocktail!

382
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:17,305
You know, did I tell you I’m having a recurring dream lately, about a magic pina colada?

383
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:21,831
With whip cream, and a ton of rum, and a talking little paper umbrella!

384
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:25,005
If you’re having dreams like that, you don’t need a cocktail! How about a movie?

385
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:26,706
I have to get up to pee every five minutes.

386
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,783
But, we can sit on an aisle near the back and you can fill me in on what I missed!

387
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:30,541
Sookie.

388
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:33,714
Why don’t we just stay home?

389
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:35,358
No! We’re hitting the town!

390
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:36,290
Not tonight.

391
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:39,584
We have to. I can’t let you become this spinster on the couch.

392
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,826
We can go inside and order in pizza.

393
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:44,903
You need to go out, and see things, and do things!

394
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:47,253
I have ‘A Star is Born’. All three versions.

395
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:50,074
We can compare and contrast performances and dosages!

396
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:52,516
It is my responsibility as your best friend to make sure

397
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:55,250
you go do exciting things even when you don’t want to.

398
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:56,919
Hanging out with you is exciting!

399
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:57,832
It is?

400
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:00,099
And with pepperoni and some extra cheese – look out.

401
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,405
I am getting kind of hungry!

402
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:03,529
Well, sure, all this partying will do that to you.

403
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:05,666
Can we watch the Streisand ‘A Star is Born’ first?

404
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:08,635
I really love that scene where she chews on Kris Kristofferson’s lip!

405
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:09,368
Yeah!

406
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:20,530
So, where are all of your Yale friends for Spring Break?

407
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:21,758
Oh, here and there.

408
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,648
Did your friend Paris make interesting plans?

409
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:24,400
Not really.

410
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:27,109
And how’s the shortcake?

411
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,220
It’s fine, thanks.

412
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,429
I know this seems a bit basic, but Eliza found the first decent strawberries of the year.

413
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,857
I’m so mad at California.

414
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,243
Well, you’d think that rain would be good for crops.

415
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,630
It’s counterintuitive.

416
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:40,873
Anyway, these strawberries are wonderful. Could you pass them to me, Rory?

417
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:53,180
So, Rory. Is everything all right with you this evening?

418
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:54,178
I’m fine, Grandpa.

419
00:17:57,831 --> 00:18:00,349
You’d tell us if anything was bothering you.

420
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:01,660
Really, it’s nothing.

421
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:04,988
Seems as though there might be something on your mind.

422
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,843
Not really.

423
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:07,968
All right.

424
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,459
So, Grandpa, you hardly told me anything about your trip?

425
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,247
How was the Archaeological museum?

426
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:14,173
Oh, now, that’s it.

427
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:14,819
Emily –

428
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,155
What is wrong with you?

429
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:16,974
Nothing.

430
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:20,948
I asked you about that museum earlier and all you did was mumble something about hitting it!

431
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:22,878
I should have been more expansive. I’m sorry.

432
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,691
You’ve been pushing me away all evening!

433
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:25,567
Emily, please.

434
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:27,583
You asked your grandfather question after question

435
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:32,216
and make polite chit-chat about the duck with the maid, what’s her name, tell her it’s wonderful –

436
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,266
Because she made it! And her name is Eliza!

437
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:37,620
I told her to make it! You’re enjoying duck because I requested duck!

438
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:40,834
Well, it was a great duck, Grandma! Kudos on the duck!

439
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:43,257
This isn’t you, this attitude of yours. This is your mother.

440
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:44,224
Don’t bring up Mom.

441
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,503
Look, both of you. Let’s try to calm down.

442
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,712
Why are you acting this way?

443
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:49,478
Your memory can’t be that short, Grandma!

444
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:50,187
What does that mean?

445
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:51,495
Do we really have to get into this?

446
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,922
You should walk out that door and come in again. Start all over.

447
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,586
She doesn’t need to do that, Emily.

448
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:57,963
- We have a contract!
- A contract!

449
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,070
We pay for Yale. You come to dinner every Friday night and you act pleasantly and decently.

450
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,054
You’re right, Grandma. We do have a contract.

451
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,901
But it’s to come to dinner. Period.

452
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:09,518
There’s no agreement on how vivacious or bubbly I have to be.

453
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:11,474
- You need to act like you!
- I am!

454
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,505
This isn’t you!

455
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:14,485
Look, Grandma, you know what you did.

456
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:15,530
Rory, please sit down.

457
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,081
I mean, what did you expect?

458
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:20,819
Ten Acropolis postcards and I forget the fact that you broke up Mom and Luke?

459
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:25,540
Now, I respect our contract. And I will continue to come every Friday night and eat dinner with you.

460
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,591
But I won’t guarantee an attitude that will please you. Excuse me.

461
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:30,470
You are certainly not excused, we’re not through.

462
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,882
We have had dessert, I’ll skip the port. Good night.

463
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:33,527
Rory.

464
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,436
Good night, Grandpa. I’ll see you in a week.

465
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,940
See, now, this is perfect.

466
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:51,172
It’s not a nightclub, but it’s a place she never goes.

467
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,283
Different and exciting.

468
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:53,128
And chocolaty.

469
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:53,937
Are you having fun?

470
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:56,134
Oh, not missing the couch a bit.

471
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,453
Hi, Lorelai. Wow, twice in one day, huh?

472
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,356
Hi, Frankie. Yeah, well, gotta have some pie, you know.

473
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:06,283
Well, I haven’t memorized the menu yet.

474
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,147
You come here?

475
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:09,093
You know, just once a – day.

476
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,943
Unbelievable.

477
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:11,269
Well, I have to go somewhere in the mornings.

478
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:13,435
I didn’t want to take you somewhere you always go!

479
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:16,814
I had a great time tonight, and I appreciate your concern.

480
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:20,142
And I promise, I am not going to become a couch potato spinster woman.

481
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:24,746
Okay, the minute this comes out, you and I are going away for a weekend. Just the two of us.

482
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:28,874
Absolutely, except for the fact that you’ll have a newborn baby at home, that’s a perfect plan.

483
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:31,796
- Hello, ladies!
- Hi, kid. How’d you know we’d be here?

484
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:34,076
What do you mean? You’re always here. Hey, Sookie.

485
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,857
Hey, egghead. Do you want some pie?

486
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,269
Oh, I never say no to pie.

487
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:38,431
So how was dinner?

488
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:39,912
Loud.

489
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:40,623
Meaning?

490
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:41,545
There was yelling.

491
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:42,493
Why, what happened?

492
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,468
I just got so mad. She was acting like nothing was wrong.

493
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,181
Like it was totally normal that you weren’t there. And I couldn’t take it.

494
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:49,020
I understand.

495
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,310
I understand too.

496
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:51,764
Are you getting sleepy, there, Sookie?

497
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,868
No, I’m fine. Just a little past my bedtime is all. Keep talking.

498
00:20:55,944 --> 00:20:57,096
I left during shortcake.

499
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,576
I’m sorry to hear that.

500
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:00,188
Hey, Grandma did this. You didn’t.

501
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:02,253
I know. I just hate that you’re fighting with them.

502
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:03,178
Don’t worry about it.

503
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:05,165
She’s sleeping.

504
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,873
Yeah, well, we partied pretty hard tonight.

505
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,891
Should we wake her up?

506
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:10,899
Nah, we’ll wait a minute.

507
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,778
Mom. Can you -

508
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:13,807
What?

509
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:17,432
Something wrong?

510
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,426
Is it about Grandma?

511
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:22,329
Do I have to ask eighteen more of these?

512
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,286
You know how, with Dean, things didn't exactly go the way I planned?

513
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,022
You mean with you and him getting together?

514
00:21:28,135 --> 00:21:30,220
No, I mean, yes, that too.

515
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,140
But I promised you that I would come to you and talk to you when I thought I was ready to -

516
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:39,327
but I didn't, um, because it all happened so fast and I didn't get a chance

517
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:43,811
and then everything got so messed up, and then after, it was weird.

518
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:48,616
The situation was weird, and I didn't feel comfortable coming to talk to you about anything concerning us at all -

519
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,669
You can always talk to me. Even when it's weird.

520
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,349
I know. I want to. I want to go back to talking about everything. Just like before Dean.

521
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:55,640
I second that motion.

522
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,750
So I thought I would come talk to you now about Logan.

523
00:21:58,012 --> 00:21:59,696
Oh. Okay.

524
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,812
I want to tell you now, so you hear it from me, right when it's… starting.

525
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,983
Right when it's starting? Oh. Got it. So, the two of you are starting something, huh?

526
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:12,067
Yes. We have definitely started something.

527
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:16,064
Started! Oh, you have already started something. Wow. Okay, fast.

528
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:19,567
I know, but he's so great. I mean, you've seen him. He's beautiful,

529
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:24,048
and really smart. Smarter than me, I swear. And he's – great.

530
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,491
Yes, he seems great.

531
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:27,258
And we have a lot in common, which is good.

532
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:28,149
Very good.

533
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,876
The paper, and Yale of course, and he's extremely well-read.

534
00:22:31,943 --> 00:22:34,677
And I know Logan's rich, and I know you don't really -

535
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:37,120
No, no. Rory, I don't care if he's rich. If you like him -

536
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:38,498
I do. I really like him.

537
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:39,598
And he's treating you well.

538
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:43,291
He is. I'm having fun. A lot of fun.

539
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:48,071
Okay, well. If he's that important to you, I should probably, you know,

540
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,271
meet him again, under different circumstances.

541
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,050
Right.

542
00:22:52,174 --> 00:22:53,560
Everything all buttoned and zipped.

543
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:54,744
You will, I promise.

544
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:55,864
Good, that's good.

545
00:22:56,254 --> 00:22:58,573
Anyhow, I just wanted you to know.

546
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,612
Okay, so.

547
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:02,521
Good talk.

548
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,357
Yeah?

549
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:04,400
Absolutely.

550
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:08,133
Man, I feel like I should buy you a shot or something.

551
00:23:08,276 --> 00:23:09,220
How about a rum ball?

552
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:10,933
Two rum balls, coming up.

553
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:16,602
Hello?

554
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:17,963
Lorelai, it’s your father.

555
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:20,298
Well, hello there, my father. What can I do for you?

556
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:22,598
Well, you can take a more serious tone, for starters.

557
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,384
Oh. Hello, my father.

558
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:25,050
Lorelai.

559
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:27,273
Oh, sorry. I thought the British thing made it pretty serious.

560
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:30,125
I assume you heard what happened at dinner last night?

561
00:23:30,186 --> 00:23:31,154
Did it involve a fork?

562
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,454
No, it did not.

563
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:36,263
It involved your daughter being incredibly rude and insensitive to her grandmother.

564
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,655
I heard there was a bit of a flare-up there, yes.

565
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,553
It was more than a flare-up. I’ve never seen Rory behave like that.

566
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:43,058
Well, she was upset, Dad.

567
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:44,865
Well, that is no excuse!

568
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:46,161
Well, I don’t know what to tell you.

569
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:48,071
You can tell me what you intend to do about it.

570
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:48,987
Uh, nothing?

571
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:50,384
You have to talk to her!

572
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,466
No, I do not.

573
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:55,316
Lorelai, you are her mother. It is up to you to set an example for your daughter.

574
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:57,749
I did set an example for her, Dad. I didn’t go to dinner.

575
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,985
She went anyhow, damn kids, you can’t teach them anything.

576
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:02,136
She yelled at her grandmother, Lorelai!

577
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,929
At the dinner table, right in front of me!

578
00:24:03,996 --> 00:24:05,300
Well, this is none of my business.

579
00:24:05,373 --> 00:24:08,260
Of course it’s your business! It’s your battle she’s fighting.

580
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:09,908
I do not have a battle.

581
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:12,786
You need to talk to her and tell her that this behavior is not –

582
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:14,901
Dad, listen to me. This is Rory’s thing, okay?

583
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:16,370
She was mad. She was upset.

584
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:18,015
Well, what does Rory have to be upset about?

585
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:20,590
Rory loves Luke, Dad. She does not want to see him hurt

586
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:22,909
and humiliated like he was. She cares about me.

587
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,758
Your mother did what she thought –

588
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:28,476
Whoa, just stop right there. I’m not interested in why Mom did what she did.

589
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,927
- Well, I was just –
- Luke and I have broken up, Dad. Okay?

590
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:34,618
We are no longer together. And it is a direct result of what Mom did.

591
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:38,152
And I know that you could care less, and I know that Mom will be thrilled, but I am not thrilled.

592
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:40,568
I am not thrilled. And Rory is not thrilled.

593
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:43,396
We’re both hurt and extremely upset.

594
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:48,398
Now, I can stay away and not come to dinner and not see Mom, but Rory made a deal with you guys,

595
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,476
and Rory never goes back on anything she says, so she went. She was there,

596
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:55,560
and if she was rude or cold, then I’m sorry, but I personally feel she has every right to be,

597
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:58,373
and you and Mom will just have to work that out with her yourselves.

598
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:00,773
So then this is it? You’ll never visit our home again?

599
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:01,757
I don’t know.

600
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:05,417
You’ll send Rory, but you’ll avoid us at Thanksgiving? On Christmas?

601
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,353
Probably.

602
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:09,319
So we’re just supposed to accept the fact that we’ll never see you again?

603
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:12,621
You can see me anytime you want, Dad. I have no beef with you.

604
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:13,405
I see.

605
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:15,484
Well.

606
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:16,697
Uh, Dad?

607
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,286
Yes?

608
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:19,627
While you’re all calm and quiet there, can I ask you a question?

609
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:20,521
Go ahead.

610
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:25,263
Well, the premium on my insurance policy at the inn is going up fifteen percent

611
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:26,933
because of some small damage claims –

612
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:29,323
I’m sorry, you’re asking me a question about insurance?

613
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:29,988
Yeah.

614
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:33,077
Carry on.

615
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:36,119
So these guys came by the Inn last week, and –

616
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:39,979
Oh. Dad, I gotta call you back in a sec, okay? Thanks. Bye.

617
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:42,596
Excuse me! Hello! Hi, hi.

618
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:43,871
Is this your boat?

619
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:46,640
Ah, technically. It is. Yeah.

620
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:48,474
And I’m sorry that it’s parked out here like this, but, see,

621
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,732
it’s supposed to be auctioned off for charity for the National Boating for Peace

622
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:55,959
and, uh, low blood sugar organization for tiny children,

623
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,835
and so they delivered it early and not finished,

624
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:03,854
and so it was dropped off here, so, to be picked up by the boat finishing guys.

625
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:06,261
I’m supposed to move it. But there was this kitten. In a tree.

626
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:08,339
He had a cold, and I had to bring him a Kleenex, and –

627
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:10,362
Just move it on street-cleaning days.

628
00:26:10,516 --> 00:26:11,346
Yes, ma’am.

629
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:22,000
You want some ketchup, Kirk?

630
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:25,771
No, thanks. The distinct charred flavor of this meat is like a delicacy.

631
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:27,931
I wouldn’t dream of obscuring it with condiments.

632
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:29,066
I think that’s a pancake.

633
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,532
Fascinating.

634
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,517
Luke, my cheeseburger and fries up yet?

635
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,569
How would I know? What am I, a food psychic?

636
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:38,565
What, do you want to know how the grapefruit crop’s gonna be this year?

637
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:41,663
Hold on, I’m getting a message from a kumquat from beyond the grave.

638
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:43,105
Okay, I’ll go see for myself.

639
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:45,048
Hey, Luke, can I get a napkin?

640
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:50,460
A cloth napkin and a moist towlette, all in one!

641
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:52,656
I’ve got a delivery, I’ll be right back!

642
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:55,196
Sit anywhere?

643
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:59,696
Ah, listen. I will be back in fifteen minutes. Why don’t you wait, and let me seat you then?

644
00:26:59,758 --> 00:27:00,285
What?

645
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:02,343
- Just trust me –
- Forget it! I’m hungry now.

646
00:27:02,718 --> 00:27:04,423
Okay. Anywhere’s fine.

647
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,931
- Soup’s on!
- Oh, thank God. I am starving.

648
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,526
I have been dreaming about Luke’s cheeseburgers for a month.

649
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:30,612
How’s the inventory coming?

650
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,073
Perfect. I have a great system going. This is my ‘to be written down’ pile,

651
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:37,981
my ‘already written down’ pile, and this is my pile of books that I have seen and now have to buy.

652
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,009
That’s a big pile.

653
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,695
Yep.

654
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,083
Bigger than the other two piles.

655
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,698
Yep.

656
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,326
This job must be costing you a fortune.

657
00:27:43,383 --> 00:27:43,968
Yep.

658
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:47,458
Oh, my God.

659
00:27:48,548 --> 00:27:49,562
What is that thing?

660
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:51,000
Sorry. I should have warned you.

661
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,914
This is disgusting! This is from Luke’s?

662
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:54,724
Yeah, he’s been a little off his game lately.

663
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:57,140
Off his game? It’s like Tiger Woods made this thing.

664
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:58,312
Luke’s been in a mood.

665
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,095
And he’s taking it out on the cheeseburgers?

666
00:28:00,171 --> 00:28:02,654
It’s been awful. Everything’s either been burnt or dropped.

667
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,932
He’s absolutely miserable. He just mopes and growls and stomps around.

668
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,329
He throws customers out the door.

669
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,032
Geez.

670
00:28:08,112 --> 00:28:10,263
I’m assuming his mood might have something to do

671
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:13,611
with a certain someone who’s been spending a lot of her time at Weston’s lately.

672
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:15,292
Oh, poor, sad Luke.

673
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:16,485
Poor, sad tips.

674
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:19,015
Listen, I have to get something to eat. You want to run over to Al’s with me?

675
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:21,399
Can’t. If Luke’s left alone too long, he might burn the place down.

676
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:22,788
Well, how about tonight? You want to do something?

677
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,139
I would love to, but Zach is cooking me dinner.

678
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,467
Really? Oh, it’s so sweet.

679
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,648
- It is, isn’t it?
- It’s so nice that you have Zach.

680
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,338
I know, it’s like having a perfect haircut every single day.

681
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,894
My God, that is beautiful.

682
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,707
I’ll call you later?

683
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,192
Okay. Thanks for the concept of lunch.

684
00:28:36,265 --> 00:28:36,908
Anytime.

685
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:43,801
This job was a great idea.

686
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:50,323
Hey, Sookie? Has my dad –

687
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,281
August fourteenth!

688
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:52,172
Oh, geez!

689
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:53,642
What are you doing August fourteenth?

690
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:56,387
Uh, recovering from the grand jete you just did there?

691
00:28:56,457 --> 00:28:59,546
Last night I called Jackson’s sister – Colleen, not the drunk one –

692
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:02,587
and I asked her to take the kids on the weekend of August fourteenth

693
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:04,595
because by then there will be kids,

694
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:07,334
and I will be free to girlfriend the weekend away.

695
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:08,255
What do you think?

696
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:09,750
Oh, shoot.

697
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:10,375
What?

698
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:11,829
Well, If you had just gotten to me sooner.

699
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,299
Sooner than six months ahead of time?

700
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:14,854
Well, August is my bathing month.

701
00:29:14,943 --> 00:29:20,047
Oh, well, September will probably work, and you’re joking.

702
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:21,679
August fourteenth would be perfect.

703
00:29:21,753 --> 00:29:22,972
Oh, yay!

704
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:25,025
Hey, Dad, how’s it look?

705
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:28,976
Why don’t you go and check that landing again, Phil? I’ll be up in a moment.

706
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:32,792
Well, is it bad, is it good, am I screwed? What do you think?

707
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:35,315
Philip and I have thoroughly toured the property,

708
00:29:35,505 --> 00:29:40,876
and with the exception of one too many garden gnomes, we have found it to be in top shape.

709
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:41,527
Really?

710
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:44,046
Yes. I’ve also reviewed your policy,

711
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:49,038
and while I tip my hat to the criminal genius who convinced you to sign it, I find it appalling.

712
00:29:49,105 --> 00:29:51,849
I knew the name Sheisty McSheisterson should have tipped me off.

713
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,355
You can do better. And I can help.

714
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:54,394
Don’t you tease me, Gilmore.

715
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:55,699
Oh, no, I wouldn’t dare.

716
00:29:55,787 --> 00:29:56,463
So what do we do?

717
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:59,208
Well, Philip will go over the property again, he’ll take some pictures,

718
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:01,875
and tomorrow I will put a new policy together for you.

719
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:03,350
Oh my God, you’re my lifesaver.

720
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:05,153
Hey, can I make you guys some lunch?

721
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:06,202
No, thank you, Sookie.

722
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:07,814
Come on, Dad. Not even a sandwich?

723
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:10,210
I’ll tell you what. I’ll have some coffee, if you’re offering.

724
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:11,076
We’re offering.

725
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:12,721
I’ll heat up some scones to go with it.

726
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,064
- Oh, no, I don’t – uh, I don’t want the –
- Forget it, Dad. You’re getting scones.

727
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:16,770
My God, this is a bossy place.

728
00:30:18,198 --> 00:30:21,506
You know, I have to say, Lorelai. You’ve done a wonderful job here.

729
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:22,888
Thank you, Dad.

730
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,166
Well, the restoration. The rooms. The homey feel.

731
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:28,229
And the stables – very smart.

732
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:28,828
Yes.

733
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:29,893
People love horses.

734
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,316
They turned out to be quite a draw.

735
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:36,093
Hmm. You know, small inns like this are very fashionable right now.

736
00:30:36,271 --> 00:30:40,461
The larger hotel chains are constantly searching to acquire charming places like this.

737
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,948
They keep them just as they are, usually retain the management.

738
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,418
I could, uh, do a little sniffing around for you if you like.

739
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:50,496
Are you talking about selling my inn?

740
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:51,915
Well, you would still run it.

741
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,588
But you’d make a lot of money.

742
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,705
I’m good, Dad.

743
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,180
Well, you should really think about it.

744
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:59,830
I don’t think I’m going to be selling this place, but thank you for the suggestion.

745
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:01,858
Yes, well, if you change your mind.

746
00:31:01,955 --> 00:31:03,636
Yes, I know where to find you.

747
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:06,001
Oh, my, what is that heavenly smell?

748
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:06,969
Scones.

749
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:09,953
I have never smelled anything as heavenly as this.

750
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,065
Wait till you taste them.

751
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:12,653
More bubbly, my dear?

752
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:13,506
Please.

753
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,978
I opened the bottle this afternoon, so it’s just the way you like it. Nice and flat.

754
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,655
You’re very sweet. This whole thing was so sweet, Zach. Cooking me dinner?

755
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:21,398
It was fun.

756
00:31:21,485 --> 00:31:22,555
The sauce was amazing.

757
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:27,254
My own creation. Ragu with garlic salt, cayenne pepper and a dash of wasabi.

758
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:28,341
It made my ears pop.

759
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:29,361
One of the benefits.

760
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:30,748
Spaghetti was just right, too.

761
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:33,072
I threw some up against the wall to tell if it was done.

762
00:31:33,144 --> 00:31:35,614
Made a shape like Peter Gabriel’s big bloated head.

763
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:36,790
It’s still there if you want to see it.

764
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:37,833
Yeah? Cool.

765
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,846
But not now, okay?

766
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:43,390
- Later.
- Oh, sure.

767
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:47,736
You’re the best, you know.

768
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:49,175
The coolest,

769
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:51,141
the cutest.

770
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:53,429
Aw, thanks. Back at you.

771
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:56,513
I liked you the day I met you. I even remember what you were wearing.

772
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,620
Oh, God. I probably looked like a pig. I need more clothes.

773
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:01,807
I want this to be right, you know?

774
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:03,814
Yeah. Absolutely.

775
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,279
Music’s good for you?

776
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:06,380
Sure.

777
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,734
- That was nice.
- Yeah, it was.

778
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,408
We should probably clear the plates, right?

779
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:20,968
What?

780
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,955
Just to get them soaking.

781
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:24,044
No. Uh, later.

782
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:26,455
After.

783
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,596
Okay. After what?

784
00:32:29,378 --> 00:32:30,527
After.

785
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,093
Right.

786
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:35,139
After.

787
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,488
- Oh, my God!
- What?

788
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,593
You want to have sex.

789
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:44,801
Kind of.

790
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:45,846
Oh, my God!

791
00:32:47,142 --> 00:32:48,525
You didn’t know where this was heading?

792
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,646
How could I have known, Zach?

793
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:50,783
I thought it was clear.

794
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:51,755
How, how?

795
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:53,537
I cooked. I never cook.

796
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,017
I don’t know that you’ve never cooked. I’ve known you, what, two years? This could be a dormant hobby.

797
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,108
I lit candles.

798
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,479
I thought you were trying to save on electricity. Very prudent.

799
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:04,325
I told you I wanted to have a special evening with you.

800
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:05,211
That’s a clue?

801
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:07,633
I don’t say crap like ‘special evening’, Lane!

802
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,185
- I play guitar!
- Okay! But –

803
00:33:09,229 --> 00:33:13,608
I lined the path to the bedroom door with rose petals? You had to have seen that.

804
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:16,219
I thought you tracked them in. You’re always stepping in things, Zach.

805
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:17,883
I don’t know what else I could have done.

806
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:19,660
Yeah, well, neither do I.

807
00:33:20,586 --> 00:33:21,283
What?

808
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:24,708
You’re right. You gave me, like, eighty-three clues, and I missed them all. I’m stupid.

809
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:25,559
You’re not.

810
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,271
I was just trying to be subtle and that’s not my thing.

811
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,717
I’m bad, I’m a bad man.

812
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,883
You’re not bad. You’re good. I’m stupid.

813
00:33:34,954 --> 00:33:37,171
I pushed you. I should be arrested.

814
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:40,412
No, Zach. I should have known.

815
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:44,176
We’ve been dating for what, four months?

816
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:47,171
And we live together, and I’m twenty.

817
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,290
You’re a guy, and I’m a girl.

818
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,915
Birds do it, bees do it.

819
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:56,864
So, what do you think?

820
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:58,733
Oh, well, I have to wait until I get married.

821
00:33:58,814 --> 00:33:59,337
What?

822
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,205
- I have to wait till I get married?
- I didn’t know that.

823
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:02,440
- Neither did I.
- Whoa.

824
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:03,265
Yeah, whoa.

825
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,693
I don’t know if I’m okay with that.

826
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:06,552
I’m not sure if I’m okay with that either.

827
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:10,146
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

828
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:11,661
- I’ll do it.
- No, Zach.

829
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:14,596
You’re not getting any tonight, the least I can do is clean up.

830
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,961
Emily, I don’t believe we’ve finished talking about this.

831
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,972
I think once you take a step back and think about this

832
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,209
you will see that there is nothing to be upset about.

833
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:36,541
I’m not upset, Richard.

834
00:34:36,613 --> 00:34:37,252
You’re not.

835
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,635
No, I’m not.

836
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:40,698
Oh, that flower just had it coming, I assume.

837
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:41,907
You’re loving this, aren’t you?

838
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:42,833
Loving what?

839
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:48,224
Rory won’t even look at me, but it’s ‘Grandpa, how was Greece?’ and ‘Grandpa, I just love my gift’!

840
00:34:48,282 --> 00:34:49,474
Oh, now, Emily.

841
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:52,466
Lorelai won’t take my calls, but runs to Daddy with her insurance problems.

842
00:34:52,531 --> 00:34:54,474
Well, her insurance company’s been robbing her blind!

843
00:34:54,544 --> 00:34:55,128
Please.

844
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,836
Well, would you like to see her policy? The deductible alone –

845
00:34:57,898 --> 00:35:00,817
You’re the favorite and you’re loving every single minute of it.

846
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:02,532
This is not a popularity contest.

847
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:04,452
No, not a contest. You’ve already won.

848
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:06,653
Emily, you are acting incredibly immature!

849
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:10,785
You couldn’t wait to run over to that inn of hers for your secret clandestine meeting!

850
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:13,366
Well, how clandestine could it be? I just told you about it.

851
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:16,293
I do not understand why you refuse to stand by me on this.

852
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,322
Why haven’t we gotten stools in here?

853
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:20,214
I did what I did for her own good!

854
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:21,118
Of course you did!

855
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:24,969
I only want the best for her, and since she is incapable of judging what is right and what is wrong,

856
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:27,057
I had to step in! I had to act!

857
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:29,427
Yes, you did. You acted and it backfired.

858
00:35:29,576 --> 00:35:30,272
Richard!

859
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:32,541
Well, you did! It was a noble effort, but it failed.

860
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,762
And now we have to deal with the reality in front of us.

861
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:38,131
However misguided Lorelai’s feelings are right now,

862
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:40,687
the fact is, she is not willing to deal with you.

863
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:42,965
She will, however, deal with me.

864
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:45,937
And at least this way we still have contact with her.

865
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:47,051
Contact, please.

866
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:49,494
And hopefully, with time,

867
00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:52,653
we will be able to convince her to come back and things will return to normal.

868
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:56,488
However, if we simply cut her off, no contact whatsoever,

869
00:35:56,632 --> 00:36:00,671
then the odds of being able to get things back to the status quo

870
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,253
are not very good at all.

871
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:03,436
Don’t you agree?

872
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:05,311
I thought so.

873
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:07,168
All right, now don’t worry.

874
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:08,936
I have everything under control.

875
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,591
Of course you do.

876
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:14,168
Because you’re the favorite.

877
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:18,003
I can’t believe it. I just cannot believe it!

878
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:18,859
It’s okay.

879
00:36:18,956 --> 00:36:22,789
How did this happen? I started listening to rock music when I was seven years old.

880
00:36:22,853 --> 00:36:26,420
I snuck makeup on at school. I managed to join a band without anyone knowing.

881
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,313
I had a boyfriend who my mother thought was a Christian guitarist.

882
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,695
And I ate spicy condiments like they were going out of style.

883
00:36:31,797 --> 00:36:32,309
Lane.

884
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,386
I drank soda, ate hamburgers, wore jewelry, I danced.

885
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:36,268
Not very well.

886
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,235
Hey, any skill level’s a sin. And then I moved out and I lived with two guys.

887
00:36:40,297 --> 00:36:43,037
I mean, nothing else stuck. Nothing. So why this?

888
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,035
It’s a mystery.

889
00:36:44,123 --> 00:36:48,059
Why couldn’t the gluten-free thing stick? I could’ve lived with that. Or the not dancing thing.

890
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:49,898
Oh, you should have seen Zach’s face, it was like -

891
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,663
Like he realized he wasn’t going to have sex with you until the wedding night.

892
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:54,154
Yes! Exactly.

893
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:55,264
God, this blows!

894
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,404
A lot of people wait until they’re married to have sex.

895
00:36:57,478 --> 00:37:00,400
Yes. Jessica Simpson and Donna from 90210.

896
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:01,689
And a couple of others.

897
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,195
Oh, my God, what if I never get married?

898
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:04,097
You’ll get married.

899
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:06,333
If I never get married then I’ll never have sex.

900
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:07,993
You’ll get married, you’ll have sex.

901
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:12,534
That’s easy for you to say. You’ve already had sex with two different guys. All within a one year period.

902
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,127
Okay, you’re making me sound a little slutty.

903
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:15,437
Well, why shouldn’t you be slutty?

904
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,001
You have absolutely no mother-taught morals standing in the way of you and your sluttiness.

905
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:21,100
Oh. Well, when you put it that way.

906
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:21,996
Is it great?

907
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:22,943
Is what great?

908
00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:24,233
Sex! Is it great?

909
00:37:24,322 --> 00:37:25,525
Not in front of the books, Lane.

910
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:26,493
What am I saying?

911
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:31,070
Of course it's great. It’s great. And I will never experience it because by the time I’m ready to get married

912
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:34,131
all the men will have been taken by women who didn’t grow up in my household!

913
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,113
Going out to find a husband?

914
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:38,223
I have to get extra trash bags for the diner.

915
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,431
All right. Call me later.

916
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:58,709
You’re in my head! Are you happy?

917
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,281
You are in my head!

918
00:38:00,353 --> 00:38:01,009
What?

919
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:11,806
Hello?

920
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:12,959
We were both wrong.

921
00:38:13,147 --> 00:38:13,808
About?

922
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,295
Hemingway’s manuscripts were stolen in Hadley’s suitcase at the Gare de Lyon.

923
00:38:17,668 --> 00:38:20,200
Yep. Just thought you should know. We’re both dumb.

924
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:21,469
Guess we found each other.

925
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,508
Guess we did.

926
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:25,191
So how’s the outing in the woods going?

927
00:38:25,278 --> 00:38:28,473
It was going fine until Finn decided to go through one of his naked phases.

928
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:29,173
Yikes.

929
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:31,745
Yeah. Suddenly the cabin seemed very small.

930
00:38:31,822 --> 00:38:32,614
I bet.

931
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:35,000
Plus it got boring, and there’s too many people there I know, so...

932
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,341
I decided to cut my skiing trip short.

933
00:38:37,418 --> 00:38:38,529
Yeah? Where are you now?

934
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:39,533
Yale.

935
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:40,316
What?

936
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,229
Yep. Seems like I got the whole place to myself, too.

937
00:38:43,286 --> 00:38:45,589
I bet. Everybody’s gone for spring break.

938
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:47,858
You know it’s nice like this. Very quiet.

939
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,743
Lots of privacy. It’s too bad you’re not here.

940
00:38:49,814 --> 00:38:50,710
And why is that?

941
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,996
I just think you’d like it.

942
00:38:52,072 --> 00:38:53,194
Well, take me a picture.

943
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:55,656
You know if, by chance, you decided to cut your spring break short,

944
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:57,750
you could be here with me to see it yourself.

945
00:38:57,858 --> 00:38:58,647
Oh, really?

946
00:38:58,815 --> 00:39:00,156
Just a suggestion, Ace.

947
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:01,448
Well, I’ll think about it.

948
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:04,355
So you’re sure you’re okay with this?

949
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:06,388
Oh, my God, for the fiftieth time, yes.

950
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:09,170
But I know you had the whole week planned out. I saw the DVD’s.

951
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,947
Oh, hon.

952
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,262
Woman Under the Influence?

953
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,681
A.k. a. the story of me.

954
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:13,638
Soap marathon.

955
00:39:13,757 --> 00:39:15,118
All can be done at a later time.

956
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:16,394
Okay. How about next weekend?

957
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:18,483
Mm, let me check my spinster catalogue.

958
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,697
No, I’m going to be knitting toilet paper cozies till three. But after that I’m good.

959
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:25,389
Great, and we can do the Friday night Weston’s dessert thing again next week.

960
00:39:25,452 --> 00:39:26,475
Yeah, whatever you want.

961
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:28,092
Okay. You’re sure you’re not mad?

962
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:31,425
Oh, well, you’ll never truly know until you read my memoir.

963
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:32,215
Oh, well.

964
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:32,947
Wait.

965
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:35,339
Here.

966
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:38,687
So you’ll always have clean underwear.

967
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:39,808
- Mom –
- Take them.

968
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:41,554
Ah. Clean underwear, priceless.

969
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,340
And I’m going to cover the books you bought from Andrew.

970
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,580
- No.
- Yes.

971
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:45,452
You’re an enabler.

972
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,908
I know. You’re my only daughter. That I know of.

973
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:48,973
Mom, thanks.

974
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:49,977
You’re welcome.

975
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,695
So, he came back early, huh?

976
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:56,648
Oh, yeah. Um, he said there just wasn’t much to do up at the cabin,

977
00:39:56,714 --> 00:39:59,301
and it just got kind of cramped and gross with all those guys, so –

978
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:00,817
So, he came back early, huh?

979
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:01,553
Yeah.

980
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:02,823
- Bye.
- Bye.

981
00:40:19,874 --> 00:40:23,059
Oh, my God, I love this stuff I think is meatloaf.

982
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:26,608
Sorry.

983
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,292
Hello, Luke.

984
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:36,198
When you get a moment, I’d like to have a word with you.

985
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:38,246
I’m busy right now.

986
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,202
That’s fine.

987
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:44,596
I’ll just wait here until things die down.

988
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:55,285
You have a wide selection here.

989
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:58,147
What is mud pie?

990
00:40:58,228 --> 00:41:01,972
Oh, that’s awesome. It’s chocolate pie with Oreo cookie crust,

991
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:05,575
and sometimes you can get Luke to put gummy worms in it, like worms in the mud,

992
00:41:05,628 --> 00:41:07,107
so, you can imagine.

993
00:41:07,522 --> 00:41:09,495
Well, you’ve painted a wonderful picture.

994
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,397
Your coffeemaker seems to be full now.

995
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:16,294
Coffee, Kirk?

996
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,581
Oh, no. I can’t drink coffee. It makes my lungs hurt.

997
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:23,052
Thanks.

998
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:25,991
Would you mind excusing us?

999
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,766
Oh, um, okay.

1000
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:39,546
My daughter and I aren’t speaking.

1001
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,362
She won’t take my calls, she won’t come to dinner. She apparently wants nothing to do with me.

1002
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:49,294
I’m sure you know that Lorelai and I have had many battles.

1003
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,642
Most of them have been because I feel that I know what’s best for her.

1004
00:41:52,816 --> 00:41:57,292
But Lorelai has her own ideas about what she thinks will make her happy.

1005
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:01,530
She wants you, Luke.

1006
00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:04,773
She’s made her choice, God help her, but there it is.

1007
00:42:05,438 --> 00:42:08,173
It doesn’t matter if I agree with it, I can’t fight it.

1008
00:42:08,244 --> 00:42:09,207
You’ve won.

1009
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:11,715
Go back to her.

1010
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:14,849
I promise I will stay out of it.

1011
00:42:19,098 --> 00:42:20,793
You’re going to have to clean that window.

1012
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:30,281
The night is bitter,

1013
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,461
the stars have lost their glitter.

1014
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,937
The winds grow colder,

1015
00:42:37,164 --> 00:42:40,200
suddenly you’re older,

1016
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:50,924
and all because of the man that got away.

1017
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:57,419
No more his eager call,

1018
00:42:57,649 --> 00:43:03,926
the writing’s on the wall,

1019
00:43:03,988 --> 00:43:07,976
the dreams you’ve dreamed

1020
00:43:08,027 --> 00:43:14,479
- have all gone astray. Synchro:
