1
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:04,628
Whoa, honey!

2
00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:06,871
Oh, I'm sorry Patty, I didn't see you there!

3
00:00:06,942 --> 00:00:10,265
- Goodness, what's left to wear on your feet?
- I know, it's a sickness.

4
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:13,308
Everyone thinks it started with Bradshaw but actually it came over on the Mayflower.

5
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:15,031
Oh, well, what a wonderful history lesson.

6
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,089
Any time.

7
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:18,389
Oh! What the...

8
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:20,935
Pasquale's feeling unappreciated again.

9
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,274
We had "Star's Hollow Loves Pasquale Day" last week!

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,894
Didn't stick. Oh, listen, I want to invite you to my anniversary party!

11
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,339
Absolutely! Which husband?

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,712
Oh, no husband, honey, I'm talking about a lover that's been far more loyal and seductive than a husband.

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,373
I'm talking about that business we call show!

14
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:38,817
- Forty years!
- No!

15
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:41,938
Forty years ago today, I did my first play, off Broadway.

16
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:43,754
- Off Broadway?
- Cleveland.

17
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:45,061
That is off Broadway.

18
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:51,084
Anyhow, I thought I'd throw a big party. Food, booze, a little song, a little dance, a little salsa down your pants.

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,376
- Well, count me and my pants in.
- Oh! Wonderful!

20
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:58,702
I will even drag Luke there. So if there's any audience participation, please pick on him.

21
00:00:58,763 --> 00:00:59,930
Oh, Luke won't come.

22
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,438
Sure he will, I have very effective methods of persuasion.

23
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:05,951
They include extremely high heels and all of Jessica Simpson's bath products.

24
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:09,729
No, honey, the party's on Tuesday, the 30th.

25
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:12,796
- So?
- So, the 30th is the "dark day".

26
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:18,009
- What dark day?
- Luke's "dark day". The day that he disappears.

27
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:18,957
Disappears? Where?

28
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:22,893
Nobody knows. Nobody knows where he goes or what he does, all we know is not to try and find him.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,020
Why didn't I know about this?

30
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:29,196
I don't know, honey, everyone else does. Anyhow, you come yourself, okay? Eight o'clock!

31
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:30,942
I'll be there. See you Tuesday, Patty.

32
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,718
Ah! Pasquale, the Maestro!

33
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:39,057
My God, you look virile today. Are you sure your wife won't share you?

34
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:40,368
Oh, she's good.

35
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:35,890
I don't agree.

36
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,918
You're living in a fantasy world.

37
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:39,295
I have classes all day long.

38
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:40,780
I hear you protesting.

39
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:43,878
I've got a double major of poli-sci and bio-chem, Terrence!

40
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:45,531
I see you over-scheduling.

41
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,466
Sorry, I'm just getting a water here.

42
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:50,590
Paris, you're not yelling at me, you're yelling at the world.

43
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:53,631
I'm not yelling at all. This is the natural register of my voice.

44
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:57,287
It's the register of a timid little girl who is not putting herself out there.

45
00:02:57,374 --> 00:02:58,991
I am putting myself out there!

46
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,352
Why are you arguing with Terrence? Why?

47
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,745
Look. I know I haven't dated lately, but Asher was very important to me.

48
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:09,487
Hey Paris, I can't find my notebook? The black one with all the yellow notes in it.

49
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:11,822
You have not put yourself out there.

50
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,241
He just died.

51
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:15,735
Oh, for God's sake, he was halfway dead when you met him.

52
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:18,663
Rory, has she been putting herself out there or not?

53
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:19,384
Out where?

54
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:23,026
Out in the world. Has she tried to meet men since Asher died?

55
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:25,288
You don't just meet people! It doesn't happen.

56
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:26,896
Um, I'll just go in my room now.

57
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:30,987
Look at your dream log, you are months behind. And your pretty thoughts journal.

58
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:33,485
Okay, fine. I have neglected thinking pretty.

59
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,381
But I hardly think I should be penalized for time lost while you were in court ordered rehab!

60
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:38,344
Hey Paris, what's this?

61
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:41,407
I had a back problem. The prescription was at home in my File-o-fax.

62
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:45,032
This is a message from Headmaster Charleston. When did Headmaster Charleston call?

63
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:46,608
- Earlier.
- And you didn't tell me?

64
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,742
I'm in session.

65
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:54,877
Hello, Headmaster Charleston, this is Rory Gilmore. I'm sorry it took so long to call you back, I just got your message.

66
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:57,767
Sweetie, that was a little passive-aggressive. We should talk later.

67
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,167
So, um, how are you?

68
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,829
I'm very well. How are you enjoying Yale?

69
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,099
I love it!

70
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,558
Is it everything you thought it would be?

71
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,118
It's nothing like I thought it would be, it's better actually.

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,218
I have no doubt.

73
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:15,552
Now, I'm calling because we often ask a former Chilton student to host a prospective Yale student for a couple of days.

74
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:20,473
Show them around, let them observe classes, campus life, that sort of thing. I was wondering if you'd be interested.

75
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,437
- Me?
- Yes, this is a very special young lady.

76
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,723
Bright, focused, quietly determined. She reminds me a great deal of you.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,282
- Thank you.
- I assume you haven't changed.

78
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:33,643
Well, I've upgraded the wardrobe a little bit, but I'm basically still me.

79
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,917
Excellent. Then I hope you'll consider accepting. I know your workload must be substantial.

80
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,539
- That's okay. I can handle it.
- So I can take that as a yes?

81
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,380
Yes. Take it as a yes. And thank you, I'm honored.

82
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:49,688
Her name is Anna Fairchild. She's sixteen years old and she'll be arriving Monday morning at nine o'clock.

83
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:51,381
- Does that work for you?
- That works perfectly.

84
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,844
Very well, it's a date. I'm very glad to talk to you again, Miss Gilmore.

85
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:59,139
Yale certainly sounds like it's agreeing with you. I hope it will also agree with Miss Fairchild.

86
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:01,045
- Like Sabrina!
- I beg your pardon?

87
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:02,902
Sabrina Fairchild, that was her name.

88
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,365
Have we segued into discussing a movie?

89
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:07,187
And we can segue right out again.

90
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:12,682
I'm very grateful for that. All right then, my office will be contacting you with the particulars.

91
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:15,907
I hope you have a wonderful time. I'm sure Miss Fairchild will.

92
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:17,890
Thank you, Headmaster Charleston, I won't let you down.

93
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:20,997
What I nice thing to hear. I'm sure we'll be talking soon.

94
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:22,493
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

95
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,720
- Well this is a very big honor, you know.
- Oh, I know.

96
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:29,470
Of all the Chilton alumni at Yale, they're asking you.

97
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:30,787
I know! I know.

98
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:33,701
Well, have you thought about what kinds of things you'd like to show her?

99
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:38,683
Well, she'll go to all of my classes with me, of course. And then I thought she'd got to the paper with me

100
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:42,415
and then I thought maybe a trip to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript library.

101
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:44,431
Oh, you're going to show her the Gutenberg.

102
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:45,625
- Steve?
- Bible.

103
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:46,346
R ight.

104
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:50,822
Then I was torn between taking her to the Hewitt Memorial Quadrangle or the Science Center and gymnasium.

105
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,328
Huh. That is a conundrum.

106
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:57,049
Yeah, especially since she'll be snoring by then, you'll just be dragging her dead body weight around the campus.

107
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,557
Lorelai, these things are of great interest to any young person considering attending Yale.

108
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:03,683
Oh, I am sure.

109
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:06,924
I, personally, would enjoy every single thing on my list.

110
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:12,479
Yes, I know. But it wouldn't hurt to maybe throw a little something fun in. I'm not talking a kegger,

111
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:17,252
but just walk her by the crazy drama students yelling "Give me a location" or something like that.

112
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:19,704
- You know, your mother may be right.
- Who heard that?

113
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:22,909
Well, a good college experience is a well-rounded college experience.

114
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:27,921
It's important for you to show her that Yale students have fun, too. Oh, have her touch the toe!

115
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:29,427
- Yeah!
- Touch the toe?

116
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:34,367
The toe! The statue of Theodore Woolsey. It brings good luck to everyone who touches his feet.

117
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:37,613
And for that reason he has one left toe that's been rubbed completely shiny.

118
00:06:37,726 --> 00:06:41,362
Wow, that is fun! Make sure you get a parent consent form for that one.

119
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:45,227
Oh, it is so exciting watching you at Yale. Such a wonderful time for me.

120
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:48,673
The people that you meet there will stay with you for the rest of your life, mark my words.

121
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,363
Tell me, are you making good friends?

122
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:51,597
Yeah, I have some good friends.

123
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:53,552
And what about Mr. Huntzberger?

124
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:54,827
Who's Mr. Huntzberger?

125
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:57,065
Um, Logan Huntzberger's a boy I go to school with.

126
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:59,077
A fine boy, from a fine family.

127
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,085
- You know him?
- His parents are very good friends of ours.

128
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:03,065
Oh, you know Mitchum Huntzberger, Lorelai!

129
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:03,685
No.

130
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,477
He's been coming to our Christmas parties for years.

131
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:06,337
No.

132
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,775
His mother's on the pediatric hospital committee with your mother.

133
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,454
Oh! � No.

134
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:14,669
Well, Logan is their son. And I noticed that you two seemed to be hitting it off the other night?

135
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:15,962
The other night?

136
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,386
He's very nice, Grandpa.

137
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:20,418
I don't want to be too forward, but you made a handsome couple.

138
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:23,586
Uh, was this Logan at the "Male Yale" party you threw?

139
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:25,001
He's the one who gave me a ride home, Mom.

140
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:26,972
Oh, Limo boy. Swell.

141
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:28,446
He's also on the paper with me.

142
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:31,128
You know, his father owns some of the finest papers in the country.

143
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,152
- I know.
- Not a bad connection, huh?

144
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,536
Nope, not a bad connection at all.

145
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,722
- Hey! So tell me about this Logan.
- It's three degrees out here.

146
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,753
Uh, as of tonight my father knows way more personal dish about you than I do. That's not right or fair.

147
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:49,777
He doesn't get as much enjoyment out of the dish as I do. For him the dish is always half empty.

148
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,762
You're just talking to keep yourself warm, aren't you?

149
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,100
What is the deal with this guy? Are you dating?

150
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,831
No, we're not dating! He's just a friend.

151
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:58,920
How close? For example, if we freeze to death will he come to the funeral or just send a nice fruit basket?

152
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:01,229
I know him from school, he's just a casual friend, that's it.

153
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:03,481
- Do you think he's cute?
- What does it matter if I think he's cute?

154
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,577
Uh, it matters to me. I don't want ugly grandchildren.

155
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:09,104
Mom, I'm not dating Logan or anyone. Since Dean, I'm taking a boy break, okay?

156
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:12,248
- I'm just concentrating on school, that's it.
- Fine. If that changes?

157
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:14,204
- You'll be the first to know.
- �Kay. Thank you.

158
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,354
- 'Cause there are not many ways I can outdo my father.
- I know.

159
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:20,876
Info on you and looking better in chiffon, that's about it. Oh, and my pole-dance is way hotter.

160
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:22,421
- I'm frozen now.
- Okay. Let's go.

161
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:28,740
In my hand, ladies and gentlemen, sits the true advantage of dating a diner owner.

162
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:31,367
I am never more than ten feet away from pie.

163
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:34,377
Ah, see, I thought it was the way we always smell faintly of meat.

164
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:35,672
Oh, it's heaven!

165
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:39,051
One quick trip downstairs and I have all the treats I want.

166
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,206
- You're like Willy Wonka but hotter.
- I am not hotter than Willy Wonka.

167
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,402
Slap on a purple top hat and you're close.

168
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,708
This is nice.

169
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:57,776
I think it's going very well, you and me. You think it's going very well?

170
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,644
I have very few complaints.

171
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:02,532
Hmm. I'm going right past the very few complaints comment,

172
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,494
'cause I know you're just trying to bait me. What complaints?

173
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,119
Hey, so Luke?

174
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:11,150
Miss Patty is celebrating her forty year anniversary.

175
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:12,210
Which husband?

176
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,842
With the business we call show.

177
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:14,851
Oh, him.

178
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:18,451
And she's having a big party and I told her we'd go.

179
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:19,883
Oh, man.

180
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,984
It'll be fun.

181
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:22,459
It will not be fun.

182
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:27,430
She'll be wearing tap shoes, and there'll be songs and punch and at least one story about Milton Berle's penis.

183
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:29,648
- Only one?
- Come on! I have to have you there.

184
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,869
- Otherwise people will think I made you up.
- Fine. I'll go.

185
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:32,674
Thank you.

186
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:36,186
Okay, so it's Tuesday at eight o'clock.

187
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,007
I can't go Tuesday.

188
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,870
- Why not?
- I have to go out of town.

189
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:42,421
- Why?
- Business.

190
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:44,829
Business? Now you're Willy Loman?

191
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:47,542
Banking business in Woodbury, standing appointment. Sorry.

192
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:50,875
Hit the light, will you? I have to get up early. 'Night.

193
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:55,755
Okay. 'Night.

194
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,389
Wait till you see all the stuff I got for Anna.

195
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:07,545
Yale tee-shirt. Bulldogs sweatshirt. Yale baseball cap. Visor. Coffee mug.

196
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:10,520
I told you to open a window when you're hot gluing in here.

197
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:11,565
It's freezing outside.

198
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:17,258
Oh, wait. This is new, they just came out with this. The Yale soda cozy. How cute is that?

199
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:20,002
I can't believe you. You don't even have your loser card-swiping job anymore,

200
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:22,057
and you're buying all this crap for some kid you don't even know?

201
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:23,505
I'm trying to make her feel welcome.

202
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:26,624
Oh, she'll feel welcome. They all feel welcome.

203
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:27,903
- Who's "they"?
- The enemy.

204
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:28,892
Who's the enemy?

205
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,201
Any girl under the age of seventeen is the enemy.

206
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,541
- Okay, I'm opening a window now.
- They're coming for everything.

207
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:36,305
They're going to take our jobs, our thunder, our starter husbands.

208
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:38,200
- Don't you have a class to get to?
- They're coming, Rory.

209
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:42,363
They're coming, and they are going to keep on coming. Like the locusts descending on Mankato.

210
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,626
We'll be beating them off for the rest of our lives.

211
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:47,651
Please don't be here when she arrives, I don't want you to scare her off.

212
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:49,607
Me? Scare her off? Please.

213
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:51,968
She's the one with the alabaster skin and the perky breasts.

214
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,697
Do not say "perky breasts" to her, do you understand me?

215
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,966
Eve Harrington has arrived.

216
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,242
Hi. I'm looking for Rory Gilmore?

217
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,602
- I'm Rory, you must be Anna.
- Yes.

218
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:05,362
Great, come in. You find it okay?

219
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:09,454
I got lost a couple of times, but people were really nice and got me here.

220
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:11,629
Yeah, it's a friendly world out there, isn't it?

221
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,383
Anna, this is my roommate Paris, and I'm sorry.

222
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:15,121
For what?

223
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:16,882
- Trust me.
- Okay.

224
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:20,620
Okay, let me show you around the place. That is Paris' room.

225
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:21,398
Don't go in.

226
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,581
That is my room, and this is the common room which is also your bedroom.

227
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:27,347
Bathroom is literally outside the door.

228
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,661
And there's a fridge, with water or soda or whatever you want - oh! And I got you some welcome to Yale gifts!

229
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:35,775
Oh! Really? Thank you.

230
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:39,605
I'm really glad you're here. You are going to love Yale, it's an amazing place.

231
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:43,307
I mean, I was excited when I first started here, but every day is different and better.

232
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,839
You have no idea how much there is to learn. It's - oh, well, you'll see.

233
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:50,706
Okay. I actually snagged us some caviar.

234
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:55,841
They were all out of toast points, but I think we can use Doritos and achieve a very similar result. Hey.

235
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:58,181
- This is Anna.
- Did Paris move?

236
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:00,295
- I'm right here, Marty.
- I know, Paris.

237
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:03,874
Anna is from Chilton, my alma mater, and I'm showing her around Yale for a couple days.

238
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,515
Oh, cool. I'll put this in the fridge. In my room.

239
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:08,880
Thanks! Okay, you ready?

240
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:11,959
I'm ready. You have boys bringing you food?

241
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:14,656
Yale is a magical place, Anna.

242
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:17,252
A magical, magical place.

243
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:25,772
The oldest part of the campus is, of course, the old campus, and it houses most of the undergraduate freshman class.

244
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:31,614
It was begun be Theodore Dwight Woolsey, president of Yale from 1846 to 1871.

245
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:34,737
Over here is the Elihu Yale bench.

246
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:38,090
Now, Eli Yale was an officer in the British East Indian Company.

247
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:43,554
He gave what was then called the Collegiate School 562 pounds and 417 books

248
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:48,265
and a portrait of King George the first. And so it was renamed in his honor.

249
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:52,672
He actually gave an additional 500 pounds to the school but Yale College never recieved it

250
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:56,006
because he mistakenly sent it to the non-existing Collegiate School,

251
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,357
apparently forgetting that Yale was named after him.

252
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:01,828
Oh, wait. This is the wrong bench.

253
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,715
So keep the story, but cross out the diagram. Moving on.

254
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:08,626
There's actually an ongoing rumor that you can automatically graduate and earn your degree

255
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:11,419
if you become sufficiently fluent in Latin, Greek and Hebrew.

256
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,930
Imagine all the tables you could wait with those skills, huh? Okay.

257
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:20,492
You are about to get a first-hand feel of what it's like to work on a real newspaper.

258
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:23,824
Now be prepared. It is an extremely hectic, fast-paced environment.

259
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,312
Don't get intimidated and don't get in the way. Ready?

260
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:28,903
Here it is.

261
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,883
Everyone must be out getting a scoop or something. But you just wait.

262
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:39,060
It can heat up in a second, and when it does, man, watch out. My desk is over here.

263
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,780
I do not care!

264
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:44,425
Hey! I am your editor, Paris, and I demand that you tell me!

265
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:45,927
I won't tell you where I got it, Doyle.

266
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:47,795
You will if you want to stay on this newspaper!

267
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:54,642
Okay, you are now privy to one of the classic journalistic dilemmas between reporter and editor - the right to protect sources.

268
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:57,052
Damn it, Paris, you tell me where you got that pen right now!

269
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:57,978
The pen fairy.

270
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:01,523
That is one of my personal fine point gel tipped pens from my bottom right hand drawer.

271
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:03,626
And you went into that drawer and you took that pen and it's mine!

272
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:09,728
Okay. For "fine point gel tips" substitute "confidential source deep within the administration". Huh?

273
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:11,814
You get a little thrill, don't you?

274
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:14,302
Hang on a sec.

275
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,392
Hey.

276
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:19,202
Question. Have you ever heard anything about Luke's "dark day"?

277
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:20,201
His what?

278
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,108
Well, one day a year he apparently has a "dark day".

279
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,996
No one knows where he goes or what he does, he just disappears.

280
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:27,288
I've heard nothing about this.

281
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,460
Okay, well, did we see him on November 30th last year?

282
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:31,463
How am I supposed to know?

283
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:35,167
Because, you keep all those crazy anal Bob Graham kind of notebooks.

284
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:38,755
"Eight a. m., got up. Eight fifteen, brushed teeth. Eight twenty-five, had impure thoughts.

285
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:40,501
Eight thirty-six, sent dwarves off to work. "

286
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:43,547
I do not have my diaries from last November on me at the moment.

287
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,135
- But you do have them.
- Yes.

288
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:47,966
And they will contain where we ate breakfast that morning.

289
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:50,382
- Yes.
- I love my little circus freak.

290
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,528
- I call you later.
- Hey, did your Mini-Me show up?

291
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:53,915
Yeah, her name's Anna. She's right here.

292
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:56,138
- Oh, how's the tour going?
- It's going great.

293
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:57,817
How many boring bench lectures did you give?

294
00:14:57,904 --> 00:14:59,752
Two. But they were about the same bench.

295
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:03,240
Oh, you know what? I have someone standing abnormally close to me right now. I'll call you later?

296
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:04,560
Okay, say hi to Kirk for me.

297
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,874
'Kay, bye. Kirk! What can I do for you?

298
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:08,978
- I have a business proposition for you.
- Okay.

299
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:11,867
- How often do you slip in your tub?
- Never.

300
00:15:12,103 --> 00:15:15,824
- Okay, it doesn't work if you answer like that, so...
- Constantly. I never stop slipping even when I get out.

301
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:20,299
I thought so. Then my new line of bath and shower adhesive decals are for you.

302
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:22,731
Huh. "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow. "

303
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:27,676
Yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.

304
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:31,369
Well, Kirk this looks very impressive. And wow, very expensive.

305
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:35,997
Well, it's yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.

306
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,552
Hmm. Well, why don't you leave the catalogue with me and I'll look it over?

307
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:41,261
- Could you look at it now? It's the only one I have.
- Okay.

308
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:46,260
I like that one. If you put the fishes� faces together it looks like they're kissing.

309
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:51,699
Oh, hey, Kirk. Do you know anything about Luke's dark day?

310
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:53,706
Everyone knows about Luke's dark day.

311
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:54,681
Do you know what it is?

312
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:59,304
Not the details, just that he has it once a year. I think it goes back a long, long time.

313
00:15:59,401 --> 00:15:59,954
Yeah?

314
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:02,999
Sure, I mean, Luke's always had a touch of darkness in him.

315
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,442
I guess we all do, but Luke's a little more touched than some.

316
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:08,012
He's kind of grabbed, actually.

317
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:09,037
What do you think it's about?

318
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:12,160
When I was in seventh grade, Luke knocked the books out of my hands.

319
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:13,369
Because of his dark day?

320
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:16,691
No, everyone knocked my books out of my hands. I was kind of a target.

321
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,453
I used to wear a cape to school.

322
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:27,239
Now, outside, we just passed the women's table, which was designed by Maya Lin.

323
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:30,101
She's also the one who designed the Vietnam War memorial,

324
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:34,473
which, by the way, originally was a class project for which she received a 'B'.

325
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:38,677
The teacher who gave the 'B' also submitted a design for the war memorial,

326
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:42,711
but hers was chosen. His was not. That's a life lesson to remember.

327
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:48,712
This is Sterling Memorial Library. One of my favorite places on campus.

328
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:54,780
It was built in 1930 and it houses over one third of the University's ten million volumes.

329
00:16:54,913 --> 00:17:00,278
I love libraries. I just spend I can't tell you how many hours just - you're not writing.

330
00:17:00,371 --> 00:17:01,645
Oh. Sorry.

331
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:06,437
- I come here sometimes late at night...
- I just love how everybody's dressed.

332
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,833
- What?
- No uniforms.

333
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:13,033
I love that there's no uniforms. College, to me, means no more uniforms.

334
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,563
Oh, right.

335
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,701
However, wait till you're late for class and it takes you twenty minutes to put together an outfit.

336
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:20,472
Suddenly you'll miss those uniforms.

337
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:22,699
How many guys have you dated since you've been here?

338
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:28,167
Oh, well, none from Yale. Anyhow, the books - are you seeing the books?

339
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:31,955
Everything you'd want to read is right here. Feel it.

340
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:34,782
Feels good, right? Now smell it.

341
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:38,959
Nothing, nothing smells like that.

342
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,709
I'm sorry, excuse me - did I just see you smell that book?

343
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,008
- Hey, Logan.
- Hey, Ace. Who's your friend?

344
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:47,501
Oh, Anna, this is Logan. Logan, this is Anna, she's from my high school.

345
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,344
- I'm showing her around campus.
- Hi.

346
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,884
High school? Naw, I woulda sworn you were a college girl.

347
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:55,011
- So is she showing you a good time?
- I'm showing her everything important.

348
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,398
Mmm. Good. Make sure she takes you by the pub. Local place, everyone goes there.

349
00:17:58,457 --> 00:18:02,068
- I'm not taking her to the pub.
- Oh, please? The pub sounds fun.

350
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,867
You don't have to drink, they do have coffee. It's a cool scene, make her take you. Bring a book to sniff!

351
00:18:05,938 --> 00:18:08,134
- What are you doing in a library anyhow?
- Got lost.

352
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:11,958
Don't tell anyone I was here, ruin my rep. Anna, it's been a pleasure. See you, Ace.

353
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:13,750
He's cute.

354
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:17,847
Yes, he is. But not as cute as Pushkin. Right this way, missy.

355
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,666
I'm not being mean, I'm just - Fine! Do whatever you want!

356
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:30,104
Well I'm sorry you're so upset!

357
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:32,731
Well, you're giving me a week's notice! What am I supposed to do with a week's notice?

358
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,655
Well my son just called me from Florida, telling me about the condo, Luke!

359
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:39,300
Okay fine, go! And enjoy Florida, I hear they have great weather there. Terrific hurricanes!

360
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,445
Make sure you bring plenty of plywood and bottled water!

361
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:43,079
- Hey, hi, hello!
- What are you doing here?

362
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:46,407
I was just driving down the street and I saw you guys, thought I'd stop by and say hey, hi, hello.

363
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:47,978
- Hello Mrs. Thompson.
- Hello, dear.

364
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,164
- So, what's going on?
- Nothing. Nothing's going on.

365
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:54,737
Luke, please understand there's nothing I can do! I've already found someone else to rent the house and they have cars!

366
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:57,629
- And you just agreed to that!
- Well, it seemed rather reasonable to me!

367
00:18:57,707 --> 00:19:00,371
- Oh, come on!
- Um...

368
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:02,749
- Luke's very upset with me.
- Why?

369
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:06,856
Well, his father rented the garage, he was building a boat and he didn't have room at his place,

370
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:11,331
so he paid me to do it here. And then when he died, Luke continued to pay me for the garage,

371
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:14,695
and now I'm moving to a nursing home and I need him to move his boat!

372
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:18,755
You're mad because this little old lady is moving to a nursing home and you have to move your boat.

373
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,383
Is this really the story you want to stick to?

374
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:23,225
She called me out of the blue, and I've paid for an entire month.

375
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,338
I can give you a partial refund if you like.

376
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:29,009
Where am I supposed to find a space to store a boat on a moment's notice? Huh?

377
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,525
Did you think about that for even a second?

378
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:35,247
Could we sit down? The doctor says the screw in my hip is loose.

379
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,745
Yes, yes, let's sit and calmly try to figure this out.

380
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:41,827
No, no, I've got it figured out. Just haul it off! Trash it!

381
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,065
- Haul what off?
- The boat?

382
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:46,819
Yes, the boat. Scrap it. Find somebody to drag it away and cut it up for firewood!

383
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:48,826
- Oh, now Luke...
- Who's going to haul it off?

384
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:53,713
Anyone. Just find a guy with a truck and a hook. Strap it on and drive it away and send me the bill. I'm done!

385
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:57,463
Luke - we'll be right back. Luke, stop! What, what and what?

386
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,074
I have paid that woman every month for fifteen years!

387
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:01,585
Luke, she's moving to a nursing home!

388
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,689
And my dad was paying her every month for twenty years before that!

389
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:05,347
- Nursing home, Luke!
- I know where she's going!

390
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,139
- She's not trying to hurt you.
- Whatever.

391
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:09,445
- Hey, where are you going?
- Back to the diner.

392
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,810
- Let me drive you.
- No.

393
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:15,715
Look, I can drive you back to the diner. I promise if we pass any senior citizens I'll let you jump out and pants them.

394
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:16,683
Fine.

395
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:29,268
And here we have the world famous Luke's diner, home of the best coffee on the east coast

396
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:33,380
and the most delightful and chatty proprietor since Mel kissed Flo's grits.

397
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:38,229
Okay, well, I should get back to the Inn.

398
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:43,974
I hope you've enjoyed your tour and don't forget to buy yourself a souvenir plastic monkey on the way out.

399
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:51,039
Tomorrow's the anniversary of my dad's death.

400
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:54,347
Oh - oh, hon...

401
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:58,858
And every year on that anniversary... I disappear.

402
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:03,756
I don't work. I don't talk to anyone. I get in kind of a funk - it's like... um...

403
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,050
- You have a "dark day".
- Yeah. I have a dark day.

404
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:10,914
I thought I should tell you this because we're in a relationship,

405
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,848
and I thought you might wonder why I suddenly don't answer the phone, or I'm not around.

406
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:22,559
Why you can't flip your hair and con me into going to Miss Patty's crazy anniversary party.

407
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:25,062
The hair flip is that effective, huh?

408
00:21:25,154 --> 00:21:28,619
Combine that with your black dress, you could probably get me to be your backup dancer.

409
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,879
I'll remember that.

410
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:34,950
I've never told anyone this before. I don't really like to talk about it.

411
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:37,223
I guess that explains the thing with Mrs. Thompson.

412
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:42,961
Yeah. Some timing, her springing this boat thing on me now. I'll apologize to her.

413
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:49,721
You know, I never finished that boat. It's been sitting there half done for fifteen years.

414
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,448
Hey, Luke, don't you think you might have been a little hasty about the boat decision?

415
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:59,202
I mean, you were upset, and I bet some day you're going to be really sorry you don't have that boat anymore.

416
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:02,233
No, it's better she gets rid of the thing now.

417
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:03,689
But...

418
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:08,633
I haven't even looked at that boat since my dad got sick. Not a glance, nothing.

419
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,277
Even more reason.

420
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:15,403
If it's gone, then I don't have to deal with it. It's time to move on, you know?

421
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,642
- But...
- I'm fine. Really.

422
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:22,193
- Thanks for the ride.
- Any time.

423
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:36,016
- I love it here!
- You love it here? We just walked in!

424
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:38,536
I know, but it feels so collegiate!

425
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:40,516
Actually, you know what is great about this place?

426
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:42,051
Eli Yale drank here?

427
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:44,438
No, they make amazing cappuccinos. You want one?

428
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,019
- Yeah.
- Okay. You go sit and I'll get the coffees.

429
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:49,841
- Two cappuccinos, please.
- Sure thing.

430
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:51,576
- Hey.
- Hi, you just get here?

431
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,231
Yep.

432
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:53,700
- You want a...
- Yes, please.

433
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:55,867
I'm sorry, could you make that three cappuccinos?

434
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,401
- So how's it going?
- I think I may have overwhelmed Anna.

435
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:02,010
Her hand cramped up about an hour ago, and it's been smasming ever since.

436
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:03,992
- Really? Where is she?
- She's right there...

437
00:23:04,735 --> 00:23:08,810
I turn around for one minute.
Excuse me.

438
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:12,419
Rory, Mark and Matthew were just telling me about a great party tonight.

439
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:16,668
Really, well that was very nice of them. Thank you, Matthew and Mark, was it?

440
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,519
- That's right.
- Well, how biblical.

441
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:22,224
Okay, well, our schedule is completely full at the moment,

442
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:27,560
but if that changes - if things lighten up, or if she suddenly ages two years in the next three hours,

443
00:23:27,662 --> 00:23:31,046
then we'll know where to find you. Okay? Bye-bye, now. Bye-bye.

444
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:33,257
We'll be over here, just in case.

445
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:36,703
- Rory!
- Anna!

446
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:39,694
Well this is so not fair. You get to talk to boys.

447
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,351
- What?
- Well, you were over there talking to Marty.

448
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:47,155
That's different. Marty's just a friend. Which is another great thing about college.

449
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:51,449
You learn to have guy friends. Nothing romantic, just a good pal.

450
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:55,980
Those boys are not interested in your friendship, unless the word "friendship" is tattooed on your butt.

451
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:57,133
Now drink your coffee.

452
00:23:58,301 --> 00:23:59,390
It's good, huh?

453
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:02,775
Can I sleep with the TV on?

454
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:06,164
Um, yeah, as long as you don't wake Paris up, and that advice is for your own good.

455
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:08,498
- And if I can't go to sleep?
- Then you don't go to sleep.

456
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:12,822
I love that! I love not having someone to tell me when to go to sleep.

457
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:14,095
Yes, it's great.

458
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:19,062
I love sleeping with the TV on, and I love having no parents around, and I love cappuccino,

459
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:21,829
and I love apple muffins, and I love college!

460
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,717
What's she on?

461
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:24,981
Four cappuccinos and three Red Bulls from the fridge.

462
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:26,721
Enjoy your night. How do I look?

463
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:28,759
- Where are you going?
- I'm putting myself out there, Rory.

464
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:29,921
- Now?
- Yes now.

465
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:33,085
It's eleven o'clock at night, who are you hoping to hook up with now, Spike and Drusilla?

466
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:35,007
Just tell me if my lipstick is too whorish.

467
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,209
Nope, just whorish enough.

468
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,008
Going out at eleven o'clock at night? I love college!

469
00:24:40,283 --> 00:24:42,051
I may suffocate her when I get back.

470
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:43,213
Hey, if you can catch her.

471
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,277
- Bye.
- Good luck.

472
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,258
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.

473
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:53,033
Which brings us to this question.

474
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:57,457
Does Campbell�s work successfully resolve the disparate stances of Jung and Freud

475
00:24:57,518 --> 00:24:59,439
when it comes to the collective unconscious?...

476
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:04,195
Hey, pay attention. Professor Bell is one of the foremost philosophy professors in the country.

477
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,063
- Oh. Sorry.
- ... archetypes bordering on metaphysical?

478
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:11,194
All right. Let's call that close enough. But now, Camel can point to the repetition

479
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,989
of the hero myth in culture after culture and say, "Hey Sigmund!

480
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,983
Like it or not, here are the same basic characters over and over"...

481
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,973
- Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm right in the middle of a class, young man.

482
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:25,662
I know, I'm sorry. Rory, you can't just walk out like that. Not after everything we've been through.

483
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:28,576
You just left. I was still in bed, I mean, what is that all about?

484
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,937
- Okay, you need to do this later.
- I can't do this later.

485
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:34,024
Rory, I love you. I love you, damn it.

486
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,963
How many times do I have to tell you? God, just talk to me!

487
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:40,261
- Okay, out! Right now, just get...
- Colin! What are you doing, man?

488
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:42,559
- Get the hell out of here!
- She's with me now, I told you that. Let it go.

489
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:43,661
I will not let it go!

490
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:45,232
She doesn't love you, Rory, tell him you don't love him!

491
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,549
- Everything was fine until you came along!
- Don't blame me 'cause you couldn't keep her!

492
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:50,900
- I swear to God, I'm going to kill you.
- Oh, I'd love to see you try.

493
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:57,750
Stop it! Stop it right now! Anthony, get security! Stop - break it up!

494
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:02,958
What are you - gentlemen! You are losing control! You are in a classroom, stop it!

495
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,865
All right, that's enough, break it up, you two!

496
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:14,022
Rory Gilmore, you should be ashamed of yourself.

497
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,795
Toying with these boys like this. They used to have pride.

498
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:21,840
They used to have dignity. They used to have balls.

499
00:26:24,406 --> 00:26:27,586
Damn it Gilmore, give 'em back their balls!

500
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:44,060
- God, this is a lot of junk.
- I know.

501
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:47,155
I mean, who has three Thigh Masters, besides Suzanne Somers.

502
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:48,772
Well, Mrs. Thompson, apparently.

503
00:26:49,181 --> 00:26:52,403
You'd think if she had three Thigh Masters she'd wear some slacks once in a while.

504
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:55,106
And, I'm sorry, why exactly did you have to take all this crap?

505
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:57,271
It was the only way I could get her to give me the boat.

506
00:26:57,369 --> 00:27:00,794
Some guy wanted it, and she got him to buy all her other crap,

507
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:04,276
so if I wanted the boat I had to take everything, and that's what I did.

508
00:27:04,364 --> 00:27:06,391
I just have to hide it for a few days, then I'll move it.

509
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:07,128
Where?

510
00:27:07,215 --> 00:27:10,896
I don't know. Somewhere. The Inn! I'll put it in the old stable out back.

511
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:12,468
- Are you ever going to tell Luke?
- Yes!

512
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:15,741
- Oh, when?
- A week, a year - I haven't thought that far in advance.

513
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:20,276
I just couldn't let her get rid of his dad's boat! What if we hang the Thigh Masters on it?

514
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:22,369
- Or get more trees!
- Yeah, or get more trees!

515
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:24,387
- Jackson's got some trees at home.
- Think I could borrow them?

516
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,792
Sure! We'll just wait 'till he lies down for his nap and sneak them right out of there.

517
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:31,381
Great. Then I'll hop a fence and get Richard Widmark to sign my grapefruit.

518
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:35,240
I'd like to welcome you all to today's speed dating session.

519
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,133
Many of you have been with us before, many of you are first timers.

520
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,041
So, for the latter group, here are the rules.

521
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:46,804
Each couple will have one minute to talk and get a sense of the person across from them.

522
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:51,207
When the bell rings, the women will get up and switch tables. Men, stay where you are.

523
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,994
This will continue until every woman has met every man and after that, it's up to you.

524
00:27:56,084 --> 00:27:59,235
Are we all ready? Then let the dating begin.

525
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,650
- I'm Jack.
- Paris.

526
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,718
- Parents travel a lot?
- Why?

527
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:06,370
- Your name is Paris.
- No.

528
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,665
- Did your parents change flat tires a lot?
- What?

529
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:11,144
- Or plug the phone into the wall a lot?
- No.

530
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:15,418
Great. So we've cleared up that mystery. What's next on your fascinating list of talking points?

531
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:18,014
- Uh - what's your major?
- Seriously?

532
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:21,455
You've got one minute to make an impression and that's all you can come up with?

533
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:26,574
You want to know my sign, too, Jack? Or how about my favorite color or if I'm a "Britney" or a "Christina"?

534
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:30,414
Here, I'll ask you a question. Was the last time you had an interesting thought

535
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:32,991
when you considered flinging yourself off a building?

536
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,965
Bye, Jack. I'll write mother immediately.

537
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:40,757
Paris, and no, my parents didn't travel.

538
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:43,988
Billy, and I have no idea what that means.

539
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:46,006
Never mind. So, what's your story, Billy?

540
00:28:46,117 --> 00:28:48,258
- Well, I'm a drama major...
- Ding, ding, ding!

541
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:52,769
- Doyle!
- Paris.

542
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:55,647
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I can say the same for you.

543
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,029
So, you find any good prospects?

544
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,541
- Oh, yes, one girl wants to have eleven children.
- Good God!

545
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:02,789
The second one was cut off quickly - thank you, by the way -

546
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:05,667
I believe the words "Latter-Day Saints" were about to come out of her mouth.

547
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:07,084
I can't believe I came here.

548
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:08,294
It's my third time.

549
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:10,290
You ever meet anyone you actually wanted to date?

550
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:11,908
My bar is so not that high.

551
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,660
I don't see one person in this room that shouldn't be sterilized immediately.

552
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:16,803
Right there with ya.

553
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:20,663
So, you've been reading about those skeletons they've been finding on the island of Flores, right?

554
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,899
Oh yeah. I mean, they're only 13,000 years old. That's nothing, in geological time.

555
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:27,145
They made tools, and probably had a language, and...

556
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,656
Keep moving, sister.

557
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,773
You know, they were supposed to be master hunters.

558
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:37,503
Even though they were diminutive in size.

559
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:41,400
And then, when that other guy came in in that outfit - how great was that!

560
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:44,723
We also studied Dylan Thomas today. Why don't we talk about that for a while?

561
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:50,407
Yeah. That was cool, but when Logan and Colin started to fight, that was so amazing.

562
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:52,325
The teacher had nothing to say, nothing.

563
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:55,638
He just stood there. Do you think they'll get in trouble for that?

564
00:29:55,731 --> 00:29:58,766
- Probably not.
- God, that's great!

565
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:04,159
I mean, you can do anything in college. No rules, no consequences...

566
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:06,958
Well, Anna, there are always consequences. You're getting the wrong idea.

567
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:10,738
College is not just a crazy, wild, sleep-deprived, hedonistic society.

568
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:15,264
Oh. It wasn't the TV.

569
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,792
No. It wasn't the TV.

570
00:30:17,926 --> 00:30:19,770
This isn't what it looks like.

571
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:20,916
I hope not.

572
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:25,350
- I told you it wasn't the TV.
- Hi, Paris.

573
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,983
All right, fine. Doyle and I had sex.

574
00:30:27,122 --> 00:30:28,084
Okay, Anna, get your coat.

575
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:31,982
We met at speed dating, and we considered having dinner first, but we both knew where it was going to end up,

576
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:34,674
so we figured we'd just cut to the chase and save the calories.

577
00:30:34,756 --> 00:30:36,246
- Hurry up, Anna.
- Where are we going?

578
00:30:36,323 --> 00:30:37,019
Dinner.

579
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:38,299
It's only five.

580
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,827
You have no right to be repulsed by my sex life.

581
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,789
This is an exceptionally comfortable robe.

582
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:50,915
Dinner whenever you want, random sex whenever you want, I can't wait to go to college!

583
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:57,418
Ice cream and cereal for dinner!

584
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,383
Yeah, yeah, yeah, college rocks.

585
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:00,434
Ladies!

586
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,732
- Hi, Logan!
- How we doing this fine evening?

587
00:31:02,823 --> 00:31:05,236
- We're doing great, you want to join us?
- Sure.

588
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:08,594
- So, dull day, uh?
- Not for me.

589
00:31:09,162 --> 00:31:11,835
- Someone's quiet.
- Got nothing to say.

590
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:14,135
- Do you get the sense that she's mad at me?
- Yep.

591
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:18,926
Hey, Anna, why don't you head on over to the Fro-Yo social. You remember where it is, right?

592
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,199
Yeah, but I just had three scoops of ice cream.

593
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:24,487
Kid, you're in college now, okay? Now go get yourself some yogurt!

594
00:31:24,594 --> 00:31:25,675
Are you going to come, Logan?

595
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:28,214
Aw, I'm not sure how well I'll be walking here in a minute, Anna.

596
00:31:28,284 --> 00:31:30,504
Oh! Okay. Bye.

597
00:31:35,387 --> 00:31:36,821
That's not a good look.

598
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:40,035
- I have no words...
- It was just a joke!

599
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:43,354
Oh, no, wait. I thought of some. Jerk! Ass, arrogant,

600
00:31:43,436 --> 00:31:47,978
inconsiderate, mindless, frat-boy, low-life, butt-faced miscreant!

601
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:49,391
Butt-faced miscreant�!!

602
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,121
Why would you do something like that?

603
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,913
I'm sorry, butt-faced miscreant�??

604
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,143
Here I am, trying to show Anna what college life is really like, and...

605
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,554
- That is what college life is really like!
- Maybe your college life. Not mine.

606
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,482
That was my class, Logan. That was my professor who decides my grades.

607
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:07,161
- And you made me look ridiculous to him.
- No, I made me look ridiculous to him.

608
00:32:07,254 --> 00:32:09,015
Oh, you don't think he thinks I was a part of it?

609
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:10,868
I'll talk to him. I'll tell him you were an innocent bystander.

610
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:15,242
The whole class was in a frenzy the entire time. We never got back to what we were talking about.

611
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,849
There's another class next week!

612
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:21,299
Ugh. I know that classes and the paper and Yale in general mean nothing to you,

613
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,507
but it means something to me. Professor Bell's course is only six weeks long,

614
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:28,380
and you blew one of those weeks for me. I won't get that week back.

615
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:31,144
Look, you want up close and personal time with Bell? My dad knows him.

616
00:32:31,227 --> 00:32:32,762
- He'll arrange...
- Please stop talking.

617
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:35,645
I'm sorry you're so bent out of shape. I didn't mean to upset you.

618
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:37,437
Anna thinks that Yale is just a big joke.

619
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:40,193
If Anna thinks that Yale is a big joke after spending five minutes with you,

620
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:42,911
then she was always going to think that Yale's just a big joke. Relax.

621
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:47,217
You and me? Very different people. I have to go.

622
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:49,434
To the Fro-Yo social.

623
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,968
Yes. I have to go to the Fro-Yo social.

624
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:57,246
And yes, I do realize how incredibly stupid that just sounded. Excuse me.

625
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,773
All I'm saying is, I just want a little information.

626
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:06,928
Is this a relationship? A one-night stand? The beginning of a series of late-night booty calls?

627
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:08,111
I think I have the right to know.

628
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:10,492
I hear you. Doyle, do you hear her?

629
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,465
I do hear her, I just don't understand why we can't decide this amongst ourselves.

630
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,157
Because you can't, Doyle. Now, please tell Paris how you feel.

631
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:22,730
- Well, I feel that...
- Speak into the phone, Doyle, I can't hear you.

632
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,860
- Is Anna here?
- No, why?

633
00:33:24,946 --> 00:33:28,089
- She didn't show up at the Fro-Yo social!
- Geez, do you blame her?

634
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:30,605
- I have to find her.
- Why, did you loan her money or something?

635
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:32,832
Just go back to what you were doing, please.

636
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:36,898
Hey, Marty? Um - I lost Anna.

637
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:39,922
I don't know where. Um - just... Thanks.

638
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:43,477
- If she comes back here, call me.
- Go ahead, Doyle. Tell him.

639
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:45,607
Any idea where she'd go?

640
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:49,329
No! She was supposed to meet me, I can't believe I let her go off by herself.

641
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:50,306
Well, we'll find her.

642
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:51,801
- Mom?
- Hi!

643
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,551
Where would a sixteen-year-old girl go for a good time?

644
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:57,853
Oh, how sad you had to come to me for this conversation.

645
00:33:57,976 --> 00:34:00,357
- Mom...
- You were sixteen a lot more recently than I was.

646
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,938
- I lost Anna.
- How did you lose Anna?

647
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:04,797
She never showed at the Fro-Yo social!

648
00:34:04,884 --> 00:34:08,309
Okay. Relax. Sixteen-year-old girl at college. You have to check parties.

649
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:11,739
- Bars and Chinese restaurants rarely card.
- There's no Chinese restaurants around!

650
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,104
- The pub, did you check the pub?
- No. The pub, we have to check the pub. Parties and the pub.

651
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,793
- Okay. Call me when you...
- Ow!

652
00:34:17,032 --> 00:34:19,762
- Uh, I have to go, hon, call me when you find her.
- Okay. Bye.

653
00:34:19,855 --> 00:34:20,822
Bye.

654
00:34:22,618 --> 00:34:24,463
Oh my God, are you okay?

655
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,669
I smashed my leg on a Thigh Master.

656
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:28,051
I'm so sorry.

657
00:34:28,138 --> 00:34:31,486
And then I tripped and smashed my other leg on another Thigh Master.

658
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:32,471
I'm sorry.

659
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:34,000
Why the hell do you have so many Thigh Masters?

660
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:36,663
I have a really bad thigh complex. Are you bleeding? Do you want to come in?

661
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:38,410
No, I'm fine, I just...

662
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:42,137
You left your glasses at my house. I thought you might need them.

663
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:42,949
Thank you.

664
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:44,722
I didn't think you'd be here, I thought you were going to Patty's.

665
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:47,180
I am. I was just leaving. But I don't have to go if you want to come in.

666
00:34:47,282 --> 00:34:51,430
Naw, it's okay. I'm still going through my, uh, dark day. I'm going to go.

667
00:34:51,527 --> 00:34:52,264
Okay.

668
00:34:52,653 --> 00:34:53,892
Sorry about your foot.

669
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:55,903
- What's going on with your garage?
- What?

670
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,988
Your garage door looks all weird.

671
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,831
Oh, no, it's fine, its - jammed. Leave it.

672
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:03,948
No, you can't leave it open like that, you could ruin all your stuff.

673
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:06,069
No, no, no, that's okay - I have too much stuff anyhow,

674
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:08,720
so if some of it gets ruined, serves me right for being so darn materialistic!

675
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:10,968
- What are all these trees doing here?
- No, no, no, just stop.

676
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:13,696
Go back to your dark day. No, no, don't. There's clowns in there,

677
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:18,223
and puppies wearing costumes and they'll cheer you up and then your dark day will be ruined...

678
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:23,589
What is this?

679
00:35:24,213 --> 00:35:26,829
- It's your boat.
- I thought I told her to get rid of this boat.

680
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:30,664
She did. She sold it to me, along with all her other crap. She made quite a killing, actually.

681
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:36,077
I just couldn't stand the idea that you might regret - someday - giving this boat away.

682
00:35:36,158 --> 00:35:39,098
- Even though I said I wanted it gone.
- Yes, I know, but you were upset.

683
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,186
Oh, I was cranky. Now I'm upset.

684
00:35:41,288 --> 00:35:44,008
- Sorry. I just thought...
- You thought about you.

685
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:46,741
You thought about you and how you'd feel. You didn't think about me,

686
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:49,646
or the fact that I said I wanted to get rid of this damn boat.

687
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:52,349
I mean, I said it, Lorelai. I said it, you heard it, and you ignored it.

688
00:35:52,404 --> 00:35:55,897
- Because I didn't want you...
- You had no respect for what I wanted.

689
00:35:55,968 --> 00:36:00,893
This was my dad. This was his boat and this decision was mine. This was not yours.

690
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:01,697
I know.

691
00:36:01,824 --> 00:36:05,278
This is who I am. I don't want to hang on to things, or stare at things.

692
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:09,418
Except my horoscope. Which was absolutely the wrong thing to bring up right now. I'm sorry.

693
00:36:09,494 --> 00:36:10,340
I'm getting out of here.

694
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:14,707
No, I'm sorry. Please. Stay and yell at me.

695
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:17,072
Why, what's the point? You don't listen to anything I say anyhow.

696
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,092
- She's nowhere.
- She's not nowhere.

697
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,326
This is all my fault.

698
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:27,537
There's more bars, we'll find her.

699
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:31,937
God, I'm so stupid. If I didn't have to confront Logan like that I wouldn't have had to send her off on her own

700
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:34,559
- and we wouldn't be looking for her right now.
- We'll find her!

701
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:37,194
He's so frustrating, that guy.

702
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:40,946
I mean, I don't know what I did to get on his bad side, or why he just has to come after me.

703
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:41,977
Oh, stop it!

704
00:36:42,254 --> 00:36:45,233
- What?
- He's not coming after you. He likes you.

705
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:47,943
- He does not.
- Oh, please, Rory.

706
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:50,830
Marty, he does not like me. I mean, look at what he did.

707
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:53,835
Look at that stunt he pulled. He totally humiliated me.

708
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:57,822
Attention like that from people like Logan is like being tapped.

709
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,483
You've been anointed. You're in.

710
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:02,677
- In what?
- In with him. With his group.

711
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,712
He likes you. Stop being so naive, it's annoying.

712
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:06,881
Marty...

713
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,496
- Hello?
- Miss Gilmore, Headmaster Charleston here.

714
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:15,344
Oh. Hi, Headmaster Charleston. What's going on?

715
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:19,722
Well, not much, thank you for asking. I was just wondering how things are going with Miss Fairchild.

716
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:21,893
- Oh, Fine.
- Yes?

717
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:23,956
- Everything's great.
- Wonderful!

718
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:27,930
Then I can inform Anna's parents that the under-aged girl the Yale campus police found

719
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,201
when they broke up a rather raucous Yale party is, in fact, not their daughter.

720
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:33,207
I'm sorry, Headmaster Charleston.

721
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,823
And what a help that is.

722
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:38,129
I tried. I just - I turned around for a moment.

723
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:40,443
Did she tell you about the bench? 'Cause I spent a lot of time...

724
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:45,010
I'm sorry, Miss Gilmore, I have to go. Some angry parents will be here in a moment to talk to me.

725
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,637
I appreciate the attempt. Good luck at Yale.

726
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:49,194
Bye, Headmaster Charleston.

727
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,788
The campus police got her.

728
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:55,347
She came, she spent one day with me and she got sent home by the police.

729
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:57,958
I think I'm going to retroactively flunk high school.

730
00:37:58,082 --> 00:37:59,463
At least she's safe, right?

731
00:37:59,603 --> 00:38:00,329
Right.

732
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:03,765
Crappy, crappy day.

733
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:06,509
You want to take a cab? My treat.

734
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:11,484
Thanks.

735
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:15,197
I think I'm going to walk.

736
00:38:15,985 --> 00:38:18,481
- Marty...
- I'll - I'll see you tomorrow.

737
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:30,516
What are you doing?

738
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:32,247
I smell like trees.

739
00:38:32,473 --> 00:38:33,190
You do?

740
00:38:35,268 --> 00:38:36,595
Hey! Me too!

741
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:38,611
Now we're the crazy pine scented ladies.

742
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:41,530
How's your punch?

743
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:42,559
It's good.

744
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:46,655
You okay?

745
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:48,888
Yeah, fine. Just fine.

746
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:52,800
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!

747
00:38:53,534 --> 00:39:00,033
I'm honored that you came here to help me celebrate forty wonderful years on the stage.

748
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:06,076
It feels so good to be here in front of an audience, and so close to a piano!

749
00:39:07,465 --> 00:39:10,079
So close to a piano!

750
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:12,425
Kirk!

751
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:14,114
Sorry.

752
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:17,689
Hey, Patty, why don't you do a little something for us?

753
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,738
Well, if you insist. Hit it.

754
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:50,585
I'll be right back.

755
00:39:58,504 --> 00:39:59,309
Hey.

756
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,352
See, there's a reason why I stay away from people on this particular day. It's 'cause I kind of suck.

757
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,837
Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry.

758
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:13,512
I should have listened to you. I should have stayed out of it. You were right, I didn't think.

759
00:40:13,615 --> 00:40:17,050
I mean, I didn't think like you would think. I thought like I would think.

760
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:21,182
And my thinking is sometimes very, very wrong if you're not me, and occasionally if you are me...

761
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:26,670
You just keep thinking like you'd think.

762
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:28,001
I can do that.

763
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:32,655
Do you want to come in? You get drunk just standing next to the punch bowl.

764
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:34,105
No, I'm still kinda...

765
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:35,445
I get it.

766
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:37,566
- I just didn't want us to...
- We're not.

767
00:40:38,374 --> 00:40:40,044
- You go have a good time.
- See you tomorrow.

768
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:41,944
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

769
00:41:21,574 --> 00:41:22,476
Logan!

770
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,861
Huh? Richard! Wow, this is a pleasant surprise!

771
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,506
Finn, Colin, you know Richard, don't you?

772
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:33,396
Well, hello, boys. Nice to see you. Logan, I wanted to talk to you. I just heard about the incident.

773
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:34,070
The...?

774
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:36,482
I heard that you professed your feelings for Rory.

775
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:37,093
Wha...?

776
00:41:37,184 --> 00:41:40,435
Mr. Bell is a very dear friend of mine, as is the Dean of admissions.

777
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:43,159
- Well, you know in this place, news travels fast...
- Yeah, look...

778
00:41:43,246 --> 00:41:49,227
I have to tell you that, while I understand what could have driven you to such a public display of affection,

779
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,571
there is an appropriate time and place for that sort of thing.

780
00:41:51,638 --> 00:41:54,613
And a classroom in the middle of class is not one of them.

781
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:58,521
- No, I know, I...
- However, what's done is done. It's out.

782
00:41:58,673 --> 00:42:01,633
So I dropped by to tell you that I have spoken to your father.

783
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:03,768
- My father?
- We pounded out a few things.

784
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:06,979
- Property agreements, pre-nups, that sort of thing.
- Okay, I think that there's been...

785
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:09,497
Oh, we came to a very fair agreement. I'm sure you'll be pleased.

786
00:42:09,763 --> 00:42:15,006
Now, we're setting up a dinner for next week to finalize the engagement and start talking about the ceremony.

787
00:42:15,104 --> 00:42:18,684
Emily is handling all the newspaper announcements, so, not to worry. That's all taken care of.

788
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:21,201
- But...
- She is a fine young lady, Logan.

789
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:24,642
I want her to be happy. You'll take care of that, I assume.

790
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,648
All right, I'll let you get back to your coffee break.

791
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:30,095
Nice seeing all of you again. And Logan...

792
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:33,126
welcome to the family, son.

793
00:42:45,408 --> 00:42:49,781
I do hope one of his dopey looking friends knows CPR, or he just might not make it.

794
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:51,251
You're the best, Grandpa!

795
00:42:51,728 --> 00:42:54,266
All right, who's next? Paris giving you any trouble?

796
00:42:54,343 --> 00:42:55,604
Not anymore than usual.

797
00:42:55,705 --> 00:42:59,857
However, there is a girl in my modern poetry class who keeps kicking my chair.

798
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:01,992
Ah, I do love this place.

799
00:43:02,064 --> 00:43:03,462
Right back at you, Grandpa.
