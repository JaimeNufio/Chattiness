1
00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:03,787
So, Lorelai couldn't have been more
than, what, 8 or 10 years old?

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:05,635
But she was very definite
about the whole thing.

3
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:08,624
She looked me directly in the eye,
and she said,

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,802
"When I grow up,
I'm going to marry Tip O'Neill."

5
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,278
I swear to you,
I nearly had a heart attack.

6
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:18,356
I liked the name "Tip." I thought it
was cute, like a puppy or a bunny.

7
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:21,168
Anyway, I'm happy that
you two got married,

8
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:25,169
and quite relieved not to have
had Tip O'Neill as a son-in-law.

9
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:26,867
Here's to your marriage --

10
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:30,340
our heartfelt congratulations.
We also got you a little gift.

11
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:33,345
Oh, yes,
which is crying out to be opened.

12
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:35,809
It's just a little token to
commemorate the occasion.

13
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:37,191
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,081
I love the look of
this wrapping paper.

15
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:41,210
- To the happy couple...
- Oh, well, not the time.

16
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:44,063
- ...to Lorelai and Christopher.
- Hear, hear!

17
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,630
To Lorelai and Christopher.

18
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:47,882
Long may they live.
Okay, time to open?

19
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,581
Yes, Lorelai,
you may open your present.

20
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:52,310
For heaven's sake,
you're like a dolphin at feeding time.

21
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:01,490
Wow.

22
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:03,583
I mean, d--

23
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,073
I -- it's -- it's like, "wow."

24
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,061
It's an etching by Kiki Smith.

25
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,200
It's extraordinary, this item.

26
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:11,260
- Wow.
- Wow, right?

27
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:12,483
It's called "Wolf Girl."

28
00:01:12,497 --> 00:01:15,033
Baldwin, our dealer,
is a big fan of Kiki Smith.

29
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:16,661
She's all the rage in New York.

30
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,413
That was very generous of you.

31
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:19,520
It's our pleasure.

32
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,632
All couples should
cultivate an art collection.

33
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,242
Well, this is gonna start
our collection off...

34
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,953
with a bang.

35
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:29,591
I'm so happy you love it. We were
flying blind without a gift registry.

36
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:31,032
Well, you flew great, mom.

37
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:33,470
Of course, I imagine it's
difficult to have the forethought

38
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:36,412
to register when you
decide to suddenly elope.

39
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:39,160
Everything changes when a couple elopes,
doesn't it?

40
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:41,690
Nothing is done in quite
the traditional manner --

41
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:44,012
for instance,
informing your parents of your marriage

42
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:46,432
by leaving them a message
on their answering machine.

43
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:48,962
What? You told me
you told them.

44
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:50,652
I didn't say they were
home when I told them.

45
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:52,242
Mom, you're such a chicken.

46
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:54,383
You left a message
on their machine?

47
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:56,210
She certainly did.

48
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:59,760
I come home, and I push "play" on
the machine, and what do I hear

49
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,643
between a message
from Lily Margulies

50
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:04,013
about her fund-raiser
for tanzanian children

51
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,643
and one from my tennis pro,

52
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:08,103
but my very own
daughter telling me,

53
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:09,891
guess what -- she's married.

54
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:12,510
- Mom, I'm sorry. I just --
- Why just talk about it?

55
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:14,770
- Why not share it?
- No, no! Hey, hey!

56
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:18,272
Hey, just wanted you guys to know,
Christopher and I are back from Paris.

57
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:19,971
G.G.'s all set.

58
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:23,610
And, uh, we just ended up, uh...
getting married.

59
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,100
So, anyway,
see you friday. Bye!

60
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:27,413
Isn't that lovely?

61
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:29,100
Mom, erase that, please.

62
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:30,822
I most certainly will not.

63
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:33,303
Your father and I plan
to treasure it forever.

64
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:36,401
We're going to have it as
a keepsake or a memento.

65
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:39,211
"Remember when Lorelai
told us she was married?"

66
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:42,281
"Ah, yes, and what was 
it exactly that she said?"

67
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:45,133
"I think it was
something like this."

68
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:48,682
Hey, just wanted you guys to know,
Christopher and I are back from Paris.

69
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:50,473
G.G.'s all set.

70
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:54,871
And, uh, we just ended up, uh...
getting married. So, anyway--

71
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:51,711
The lamb is delicious, Emily.

72
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:54,412
Who's being Mr. "Favorite 
son-in-law happy smile face"?

73
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,951
I'm glad you're enjoying
it, Christopher.

74
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,813
My butcher had it flown
in from New Zealand.

75
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,891
-  First class, I hope.
- Well, the dinner is very nice.

76
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:00,572
It is.

77
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:02,501
It ought to be.
We have cause to celebrate.

78
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:04,761
Yes, we do.
Speaking of which, we have decided

79
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:07,162
that we would like to throw
you two a wedding party.

80
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:09,043
- Oh, that's very sweet.
- Very sweet.

81
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:11,630
Very sweet, mom, but you know what --
it's totally unnecessary.

82
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,050
Look, you already gave us
"Wolf Girl," which, I mean, ah?

83
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,791
- How do you top that?
- We insist.

84
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:18,793
Dad, we're already married.
Isn't it too late?

85
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:21,280
No, but soon it will be.
We need to get on this right away.

86
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:23,883
We don't want it to look as if there's
anything to be ashamed of here.

87
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,472
If we don't throw a party,
who knows what people will think?

88
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:28,461
Why don't you give us
an anniversary party?

89
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,442
Like a 10th?
Wouldn't that be nice, honey?

90
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:33,862
I mean, what is 10 --
bronze, sandstone, particleboard?

91
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:35,071
Actually, it's tin.

92
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:36,391
But that's not for 10 years.

93
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:38,243
Giving you plenty of
time to plan. Tin?

94
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:39,380
Things just stick in my brain.

95
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,463
Lorelai, you ought to
celebrate your marriage.

96
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:44,000
We did. We did celebrate --
right after we got married,

97
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:46,513
we went out and had a beautiful meal,
didn't we?

98
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:47,763
We had a beautiful meal.

99
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:51,463
Yeah, we had a chocolate mousse and
a para liqueur and a cheese plate.

100
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:52,602
A cheese plate?

101
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:54,890
Since when is a hunk of
fermented milk a suitable means

102
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,983
- for celebrating a marriage?
- Look mom, we're good.

103
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,303
- Honestly, we're celebrated out.
- But what about us?

104
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:01,610
Hey, if you and dad want a party,
it's fine by me.

105
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:04,330
Buy some 40s, rent an inflatable
bounce house. That's great.

106
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,932
- Knock yourselves out.
- What about Rory?

107
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:06,963
What about Rory?

108
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:10,423
Rory, now tell me, don't you think this
marriage should be officially celebrated?

109
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:13,341
Well... yes, actually.

110
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,703
I think it would be nice.

111
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:15,663
C hristopher?

112
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:17,521
Well, I think it would be fun.

113
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:19,611
I'm not one to turn
down a free cocktail.

114
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:21,240
Lorelai?

115
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:26,111
Okay, then, let's celebrate.
Let's have a party.

116
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:26,923
Wonderful.

117
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:29,991
Now, if we book the Harbor Club,
we can't have more than 400.

118
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:33,341
So Lorelai, I'll need a list of your
people as soon as it's earthly possible --

119
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:34,211
you too, Christopher.

120
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,700
Well, I can give you my list right now.
It's me, Chris, Rory,

121
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:38,170
Logan --
if Rory wants him there --

122
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:39,660
Sookie, Jackson, and Michel.

123
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:40,442
That's it?

124
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,791
You can invite more people than that.
It's your day.

125
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:43,651
That's my list. 

126
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:46,693
Why don't you invite some of your
charming Stars Hollow friends?

127
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:47,942
That's okay, mom.

128
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:50,561
We can make it black-tie optional,
if that will help.

129
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,543
It's not because they
don't have black ties.

130
00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:54,763
Suit yourself.
Now, what do you think --

131
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:58,052
a string quartet, or something more fun,
like a swing band?

132
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,873
My god, woman,
is there a book you don't own?

133
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:04,312
I'm so sorry.

134
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:06,551
I think I may have
re-activated my scoliosis.

135
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,180
Suck  it up, people.
That was the last of it.

136
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,373
So much for one trip, huh?

137
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:11,370
Well, who knew I had nine
trips' worth of stuff?

138
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:15,112
Your place is so big, it made my
stuff look small and inconsequential.

139
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,631
Did I mention I'm so sorry?

140
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,123
Two copies of "The
Norton Anthology"?

141
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:20,183
They were gifts.
I can't get rid of gifts.

142
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:22,823
Okay, looks like all that's left
to do now is the paperwork.

143
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:24,370
- Paperwork?
- The lease.

144
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,635
- You want me to sign a lease?
- Well you are subletting from me and

145
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:28,819
the last time you lived here, you just
up and left in the middle of the year.

146
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,431
Um, you kicked me out.

147
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,621
You moved all my stuff out in
the hallway and locked the door.

148
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,370
Well, now you'll have a
legally binding contract

149
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:36,680
that will negate my ability
to do that in the future.

150
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,371
All right. What does it say?

151
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:41,592
Standard boiler-plate stuff --
just sign here and here.

152
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,553
And initial here and here.

153
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:48,053
Okay. What is this?

154
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:51,180
"Rights and privileges of Logan
Huntzberger or any other paramours"?

155
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:53,713
If Logan is going to be
spending an enormous amount of time here,

156
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:56,632
it's only fair to assess a daily
tariff for water and power use.

157
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:58,500
- Paris!
- It's a very simple formula,

158
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,673
based on the number of nights he
spends per month at the apartment,

159
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:03,532
times the approximate minutes per day he
spends showering, brushing his teeth,

160
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:06,360
and/or surfing the internet.
And sunday is no charge.

161
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:07,952
It's okay. I'll kick in, Paris.

162
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:09,672
Thataboy, Rockefeller.

163
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:10,983
- All right.
- Okay.

164
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,551
- Welcome back to the hood.
- Thanks.

165
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,691
- It's good to have you back, Rory.
- Oh, thanks, Doyle.

166
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,730
- All right, I better take off.
- Oh, no.

167
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:19,402
You just got here,
and we spent the whole time moving.

168
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,882
Why don't you come
in on thursday?

169
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,313
I've got to wine-and-dine some clients,
but you should join us, it'll be fun.

170
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:26,002
We'll rack up an obscene bill at
Nobu and charge it all to my dad.

171
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:28,422
I can't.
It's Lucy's 21st birthday on thursday.

172
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:29,953
We're throwing her a big party.

173
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,432
I was hoping you
might be able to come.

174
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:32,591
I can't -- Nobu.

175
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:34,581
Nobu, schmobu.
It's a college party.

176
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,111
Don't you miss college parties?
Our theme's 2002.

177
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:38,701
- Why?
- Just because.

178
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,423
- What's your theme?
- Contracts.

179
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:43,130
Boring. 2002's so much better.

180
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:45,010
Just bring your clients,
and we'll let them tap the keg.

181
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:46,373
- Right.
- Come on.

182
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a 2002 party, right?
In 2002, you were a college freshman.

183
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,963
You would have been
bored by businessmen

184
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:54,643
and thrilled to go to a party
thrown by hot senior girls.

185
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:56,521
It's all very tempting,
but I have to go.

186
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:57,483
- I know.
- I love you.

187
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:58,523
Love you, too.

188
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:03,863
I'll put you down for
half a day, Logan.

189
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:05,471
Good morning.

190
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,441
Well, good morning,
madame Defarge.

191
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:10,770
Good morning, Mr. "I remember stuff
from english class in high school."

192
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,371
Can I ask how long this Mr.
"Long sentence

193
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:14,273
of words strung together"
thing is gonna last?

194
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:16,060
I'm not sure, Mr.
"Doesn't understand

195
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:18,522
the more annoying you tell me a bit is,
the more I want to do it."

196
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:21,103
Look at you, knitting away,
just like a proper married lady,

197
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:22,943
the picture of domesticity.

198
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:26,131
So what's for breakfast, Martha Stewart?
Poached eggs? Blueberry muffins?

199
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:27,750
Oh, is there gonna be
fresh-squeezed orange juice?

200
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,731
'Cause I'd really appreciate it
if you could strain the pulp.

201
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,922
Yeah, I got your strained
pulp right here, buddy.

202
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:33,290
So what exactly
are you knitting?

203
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:34,941
It doesn't matter
what I'm knitting.

204
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,290
I'm knitting just to knit.

205
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:37,440
Someone's philosophical.

206
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,851
No, someone is in training
for the knitathon.

207
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,850
And we get pledged
by the skein,

208
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:43,333
so I'm just working
on my speed.

209
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:44,811
-  "Knitathon"?
- Yeah.

210
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:46,182
You didn't hear
about the knitathon?

211
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:48,622
I did not hear about the knitathon.
Do you want something?

212
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:51,201
Yeah. Poached eggs and
some orange-juice pulp.

213
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:52,763
- How about coffee?
- Sold.

214
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:55,551
So, we are holding a knitathon
the day after tomorrow

215
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:58,162
to raise money to rebuild
the old muddy river bridge.

216
00:08:58,177 --> 00:08:59,102
What's wrong with the bridge?

217
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,852
Well, we rebuilt it a couple years ago,
but now it's started to rot.

218
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:03,271
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

219
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:05,163
It's too bad, too,
'cause it was gorgeous.

220
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,720
We all loved, loved, loved it.

221
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:09,383
It was sturdy and strong, made out
of these beautiful japanese maple --

222
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,830
which it turnes out is exactly the
kind of wood that attracts beetles,

223
00:09:12,846 --> 00:09:14,990
and I'm not talking
british-invasion kind of beatles.

224
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:17,432
I'm talking the kind of
beetles that like to eat wood.

225
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:20,530
So now we're gonna make it
out of a less-delicious wood.

226
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:22,250
Ah. So, how goes the training?

227
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:23,931
Are your fingers getting
strong and muscly?

228
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:26,251
My fingers are fine.
It's these needles.

229
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,571
I keep dropping stitches
'cause they're slippery.

230
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:29,871
I need nonslip needles.

231
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,330
Do they make nonslip needles?

232
00:09:31,346 --> 00:09:32,883
I don't know.
You know what, I'm gonna go into town

233
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,422
and see if anyone's
selling them.

234
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:36,491
- Oh yeah ? I'll come with.
- That's okay.

235
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:37,922
No, no. I could use some air.

236
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,961
Yeah, but I have
errands to run.

237
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:41,662
Plus I got to go to
the dry cleaner's.

238
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:42,860
So?

239
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:45,573
So I don't want to subject you
to Lizzie the crazy dry cleaner.

240
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,463
It's very intense, you know.
She starts complaining about --

241
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:49,853
Why don't you want me to
come into town with you?

242
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:52,821
Oh. Well, you know...

243
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:55,631
I just want to give people...
time to adjust.

244
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:57,661
- To?
- To you and me.

245
00:09:57,675 --> 00:10:00,613
I mean, I just want to be sensitive,
you know?

246
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:03,023
You're not who they expected,
and I--

247
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,451
I just don't want the marriage
to seem sudden, you know.

248
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,431
I-I want to kind of
ease them into it.

249
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,381
Is that why you didn't want to invite
any of your friends to your mother's party?

250
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:15,193
No. Well, yeah, but 90% of it
was I didn't want them to have

251
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:17,930
to deal with salsa dancing and
the peabodys and the sandborns.

252
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:20,491
But I guess 10% is I
didn't want to feel like

253
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,490
I'm shoving our marriage
down their throats.

254
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:24,233
By inviting them to a party?

255
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,761
So soon. I just don't want it to
seem like we're flaunting, you know.

256
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:29,340
I want to give them
time to adjust.

257
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:32,070
They're not gonna adjust
if they never see me.

258
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,113
Yeah. You're right.

259
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,043
Come on.
Let's go for a stroll.

260
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:37,060
Okay, but a stroll.
Not a strut.

261
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:40,411
Yes, I promise I will keep my
chicken-walking to an absolute minimum.

262
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:43,030
- How long is this gonna go on?
- Couple more days.

263
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:45,772
It's ridiculous already.
Somebody's gonna poke an eye out.

264
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:47,010
You're just bumming
'cause April's gone.

265
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,983
First, get your hand
off my shoulder.

266
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,282
Second, I'm not bumming,
and April is not gone.

267
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:53,310
She just went back to
living with her mother.

268
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,502
I'm just saying,
I'm feeling you, Luke.

269
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,062
- Luke.
- T.J.

270
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,162
- I need a drink.
- We don't serve alcohol.

271
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,111
Well, then,
anything that's carbonated.

272
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:06,032
If I drink fast enough,
bubbles tend to have the same effect.

273
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:07,873
What are you doing here?
Is Liz okay?

274
00:11:07,888 --> 00:11:09,731
She's gonna have a
baby at any moment.

275
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:11,722
- It's not good, Luke.
- What?

276
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,560
We're having a
baby at our house.

277
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:16,781
We talked about this.
You're gonna be a great dad, T.J.

278
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:20,000
No. You don't understand. We're having
a baby at our house any minute now.

279
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:23,093
Liz wants to have our
baby in our living room!

280
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:24,961
What? Why? 
What about a hospital?

281
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,351
She won't go! She's got it in her head
that this should be done at home.

282
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:31,252
My sister is gonna
have her baby at home?

283
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:33,563
She got the idea from --
phew! -- Marcy Hedges,

284
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:36,282
who plays the midwife at
the renaissance festivals.

285
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:38,992
Only Marcy has five kids --

286
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:41,042
all born in hospitals --

287
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:44,220
and now she's telling Liz
how amazing and natural it is

288
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:45,542
for her to do it at home.

289
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:46,653
This  is crazy.

290
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:50,413
Liz said she had Jess at a hospital,
and she wants to have this one at home.

291
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:53,501
She has this birth coach,
called a doula.

292
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,161
That's not her real name.

293
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,943
Don't call her that.
She's very touchy.

294
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:57,952
Her real name is Sandy.

295
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,411
Okay. Sandy the doula.

296
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,773
Anyway, Sandy's done about
200 of these home births,

297
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:06,660
and she says statistically, they're
every bit as safe as hospital births.

298
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:10,151
I can't believe she's
having her baby at home.

299
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:14,621
Anyway, she wants you to
be there at the birth.

300
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:16,971
She wants the baby to
be born around family.

301
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,992
So I promised I'd
get you to come.

302
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:20,453
Of course, sure. I'll be there.

303
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:22,383
Just call me whenever,
and I'll come right by.

304
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:24,611
Great. Thanks, Luke.

305
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:30,043
That feels good.

306
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:31,690
Yeah, all right,
I'll see you later, T.J.

307
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,370
Just let me know when
the water breaks.

308
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,120
Go take care of her, all right?

309
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,773
- All right. 
- See you, man.

310
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:54,422
That's it! All right,
this diner is now a knit-free zone!

311
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,973
Stop knitting or
get the hell out!

312
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:01,643
..yarn around,
new loop through, old loop up.

313
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,390
Needle in, yarn around,
new loop through, old loop up.

314
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:06,901
Keep a gentle tension
on the strand!

315
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,501
Humongous needle!

316
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:11,032
Careful! Just because
it's decorative

317
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:13,420
doesn't mean it's not sharp!

318
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,012
- I don't like root beer.
- No?

319
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:16,822
Not without carbonation.
You want it?

320
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:19,762
- Your used dum dum?
- It's not used. It's vintage.

321
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:21,113
It was nice of Lizzie, though.

322
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:23,852
Dude, 15 minutes of
perchloroethylene talk?

323
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,930
We earned those dum
dums fair and square.

324
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:28,513
All right, knit and purl,
like brick and mortar!

325
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:30,531
- Hey, Babette!
- Oh, hey!

326
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:32,772
Keep going with the
rib stitch there.

327
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:34,102
How are you, sweetheart?

328
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,202
Hey, Christopher.

329
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:36,241
How you doing, Babette?

330
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,532
Congratulations on the
getting-married thing.

331
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:41,091
I'd give you a hug,
but my hands are kind of full here.

332
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:42,602
- So, you eloped.
- Yeah.

333
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:44,362
We were in Paris,
and we eloped.

334
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:47,400
That's smart, eloping. Smart.

335
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,661
Who needs the hassle 
of a real wedding, you know?

336
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:50,653
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

337
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,741
All the planning and the fuss,
so much stress.

338
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:53,582
Exactly.

339
00:13:53,596 --> 00:13:56,451
Plus the dress.
I mean, why would anyone want to buy

340
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,650
a big, expensive wedding dress
you could only wear once?

341
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,250
Except for me.
I got to wear mine twice.

342
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:05,000
But once was for Halloween.
I was the bride of Chucky.

343
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,373
Oh, yeah?
Did Morey go as Chucky?

344
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:09,413
Huh?! No,
he was a futuristic pirate!

345
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:11,813
So, welcome to Stars Hollow!

346
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:13,580
Thank you.
It's good to be here.

347
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:15,293
Knit and purl!

348
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:17,643
Lorelai, Christopher,
there you are.

349
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:18,572
Hey, Patty.

350
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:20,431
I'm sorry I didn't get
this to you sooner.

351
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:22,580
Part of my job as
town social chair

352
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:25,731
is greeting all newlyweds with
the Stars Hollow welcome wagon.

353
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,611
Look at all this.
Thank you so much.

354
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,850
Just a few odds and ends from our
town merchants to say "welcome."

355
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:33,672
This is so cool. I didn't know the
welcome wagon came in a real wagon.

356
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:34,831
Yeah.

357
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:37,171
Well... so there you go.

358
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:39,130
- Oh, terrific. Thank you.
- Thank you, Patty.

359
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:42,091
So, how are you adjusting to
Stars Hollow, Christopher?

360
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:43,501
Oh, it's terrific.

361
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:45,670
I'd bet you're bored
senseless here.

362
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:47,183
No, no. Not at all.

363
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:50,362
There's hardly any nightlife.
I mean,  a worldly guy like you

364
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:52,141
must feel like he's
out in the sticks.

365
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:55,100
Well, my discothequing
days are mostly behind me.

366
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:57,853
Anyway, I probably should run.
Enjoy the wagon.

367
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:59,672
- Thank you.
- Bye, Patty.

368
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:02,052
You want a ride?

369
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,643
No. That's okay.

370
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:17,250
- Hey.
- Hi.

371
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:20,203
Um, I have some 2002
paraphernalia here.

372
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:21,472
Okay.

373
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,021
Are Lucy and Olivia home?

374
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,401
No.

375
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:28,173
'Cause they said to
bring this stuff by.

376
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:30,090
Do you know when
they'll be back?

377
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:31,182
No.

378
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:32,753
Do you know where they went?

379
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:34,130
- Just down the hall.
- Rory!

380
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:37,012
- Yay! Rory's here!
- Oh, hey, guys.

381
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,721
- You brought stuff.
- As promised.

382
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:41,183
- Let's see.
- Boyfriend.

383
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:42,793
Nice poster work. 

384
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:45,072
I went with double-sided
tape rather than thumbtacks.

385
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:46,680
I think it gives
it a cleaner look.

386
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,192
I think you're right.
Plus, double-sided tape is so 2002.

387
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,392
- You're a genius.
- You're my inspiration.

388
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:53,982
- You brought J.Lo?
- Of course.

389
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,841
- And I have boots.
- Oh, my god, so did we!

390
00:15:58,056 --> 00:15:59,790
We are gonna ugg-ugg!

391
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:02,152
My  feet were so much more
comfortable in 2002.

392
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:03,202
What do you think, boyfriend?

393
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:04,663
Very Clydesdale.

394
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:07,473
Hey, compliments only from
boyfriends on birthdays.

395
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:09,722
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

396
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,250
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey, Anna.

397
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:16,180
- How's April doing?
- She's doing great.

398
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:18,672
I'm pretty sure as of friday,
she had shown her appendix scar

399
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:21,683
to every one of her teachers and
classmates. She's quite proud of it.

400
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:22,930
I'm just glad she's doing good.

401
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:23,893
Yeah, me too.

402
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:26,222
Um, can we talk in private?

403
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,542
Sure. Come on up.

404
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:29,031
Caesar, I'll be back!

405
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,510
Oh, the place looks nice.

406
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:34,720
April's handiwork.

407
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:37,362
Right. She told me -- cerulean.

408
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:41,471
So, um... my mom --

409
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:42,763
Yeah. How's she doing?

410
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:44,112
Still recovering.

411
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,803
I think I have her
care all worked out,

412
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:49,643
but it is an ongoing rubik's cube
of day, night, and weekend nurses.

413
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:50,751
That's tough.

414
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:53,253
Yeah, especially being on the
other side of the country.

415
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:55,133
And she's really lonely.

416
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,653
I thought about
moving her up here.

417
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:00,530
But she's been living in
that house for 42 years,

418
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:02,102
and I just feel like
it would be cruel.

419
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:05,392
Yeah. Say,
April can stay with me any time.

420
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:07,002
Whatever you need.

421
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:08,661
Luke...

422
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:11,822
I've decided that April and I
are gonna move to New Mexico.

423
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:14,153
Oh. Really? Wow.

424
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,103
Yeah, I-I'm sorry,
but my mother is all alone.

425
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:21,133
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, it's, uh... wow.

426
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:23,370
But it's where I grew up,
so I know the area.

427
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:25,002
They have a lot of
really good schools.

428
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:27,152
Does April know?

429
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:31,042
- I told her last night.
- How's -- I mean...

430
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:32,832
is she okay with it?

431
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,202
Well, she's not thrilled.

432
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,122
It'll take some
getting used to, but...

433
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:38,302
So, when? How soon?

434
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:39,840
As soon as possible.

435
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,682
Tina, my assistant manager,
is gonna run the business for me.

436
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:44,730
I've already been
looking online at houses,

437
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:46,400
found a nice
little neighborhood.

438
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:50,341
And I just --
I wanted to, you know, let you know.

439
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,152
Yeah. Hey, uh, I guess you got to
do what you got to do, you know.

440
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:57,002
I mean, when my dad was sick...

441
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,540
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

442
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:01,691
I should go.

443
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,501
- I have some things.
- Sure. Sure.

444
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:06,960
Yeah.

445
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:15,911
Drat you,
you dratted spaghetti,

446
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:18,272
you slippery, slithery,
uncooperative --

447
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,922
- Am I interrupting something?
- No.

448
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:23,251
Seriously, if you and spaghetti need
privacy, I can come back later.

449
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,603
In the middle of the night last night,
I woke up with an idea.

450
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:26,582
Yeah?

451
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,410
For days,
I've been trying to figure out

452
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:30,411
what to serve at my
knitathon booth, right?

453
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:33,811
So, it's 2:00 a.m.
Flash! I have a vision.

454
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:37,182
Balls of yarn made
out of spaghetti,

455
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:39,693
with breadsticks stuck in the middle,
like knitting needles.

456
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:42,291
It's brilliant!
Brilliant! Horrible!

457
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:44,780
Not that appetizing. Why don't
you just make regular spaghetti?

458
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:46,501
'Cause that's not theme-y.

459
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:49,801
Why are you in early? I thought
you were not coming in till late.

460
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:51,860
Well, I was,
but I had some paperwork and...

461
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:52,743
And, um...

462
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,522
Christopher and I just
walked through town.

463
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:55,453
And?

464
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:56,950
Everyone was very cordial.

465
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,243
Ooh. Cordial?

466
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:01,133
Yes. They said hello.
They shook his hand.

467
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:02,911
They welcomed him
to Stars Hollow.

468
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:04,172
Jeez, really? Cordial?

469
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:07,072
Yes. Creepy, right?
I saw miss Patty and Babette.

470
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:08,522
Neither one of them
pinched his butt.

471
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:10,302
Well, honey,
you married an outsider.

472
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:11,212
I know.

473
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:13,151
We just --
we all thought you and Luke...

474
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,553
I knew people thought me and Luke.
I thought me and Luke.

475
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,822
But it's not me and Luke.
It's me and Christopher.

476
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:20,720
I know. It's just --
people really loved you and Luke.

477
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:22,752
Right. But it's not their life.
It's my life.

478
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:25,611
And frankly, I don't see why I
should have to go around feeling bad

479
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:28,141
that my life didn't turn out
the way everybody wanted it to.

480
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:30,991
- I know--
- I'm sick of it. I really am.

481
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:33,042
And, look,
I understand that you liked Luke

482
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:35,273
and you're not so sure
about Christopher,

483
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,281
but, Sookie,
you're my best friend.

484
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:39,360
I really need your
support here.

485
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:41,703
I mean,
Christopher is my husband,

486
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:44,500
and it would be great if
you would just get on board.

487
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,851
- Okay.
- Okay?

488
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,912
Yeah, I'm on board.
What do you need?

489
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:51,813
I'll swab the deck, I'll hoist
the sail -- anything nautical.

490
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:54,540
Okay, I need you to help me get
the rest of the town on board.

491
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:56,063
- Okay.
- Okay. What do we do?

492
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:58,183
- We need a campaign.
- Right. A campaign.

493
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,723
Oh, he could walk Paul
Anka around town.

494
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:03,500
Cute guy, cute dog --
very appealing.

495
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:05,790
Paul Anka's not good with sidewalks --
sensitive paws.

496
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,001
He could pull him in the
welcome wagon -- or Jackson.

497
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:09,772
You want him to pull
Jackson around on a wagon?

498
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,782
No, maybe he and Jackson
could do something together.

499
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:13,412
You know,
Jackson's got a lot of clout.

500
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,172
If people see that
Jackson likes Christopher,

501
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,762
then maybe they'll
like Christopher.

502
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,353
You think Jackson's
got a lot of clout?

503
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:20,510
Jackson has tons of clout.
He's lousy with clout.

504
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:22,390
Okay. What should they do?

505
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:24,042
Something where
they'll be seen.

506
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,100
Ooh, how about a movie?

507
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:26,230
- Too dark.
- Yeah. Yeah.

508
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:27,272
Pancakes at Al's?

509
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:28,622
Jackson is off of wheat.

510
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:30,931
But, ooh, how about 
country night at miss Patty's?

511
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:32,032
Chris and Jackson?

512
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:35,301
Well, I mean, Jackson is a fiendish
two-stepper, but he's handsy.

513
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,933
- What do regular guys do?
- Grunt?

514
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:38,462
- Scratch?
- Leave the toilet seat up?

515
00:20:38,475 --> 00:20:39,780
- Talk about sports?
- Talk about cars?

516
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:40,942
- Burp?
- Beer!

517
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:42,691
- Drink beer.
- At Casey's!

518
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:44,131
- Perfect.
- Oh, like manly.

519
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:45,320
- Simple.
- Ooh!

520
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:48,392
And while they're scratching and grunting,
 we can actually go do something fun.

521
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:51,311
- Country night at miss Patty's.
- Mm-hmm. Hee-haw.

522
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:53,941
So, what are you up for tonight?
I was thinking we could

523
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,842
rent "A brief history
of time" again.

524
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:58,703
Maybe I'll understand something
more than the credits this time.

525
00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,643
Sure.

526
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:02,511
Look... your mom told
me you were moving.

527
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:04,862
- To New Mexico.
- Yes, it's not so bad.

528
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,142
You've been there visiting
your grandma before, right?

529
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:09,063
I don't want to
move to the desert!

530
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:10,630
It's just--
there aren't even any seasons!

531
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,070
It's hot,
and it's a miserable place,

532
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:14,941
- and I hate it!
- Let's take a walk.

533
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:16,893
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

534
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:18,762
Look, I know you're
a little upset,

535
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,461
but this could be a
really good thing --

536
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:23,391
I mean, the new people you'll meet,
the teachers you'll impress.

537
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,960
- I'll never see my friends again.
- Of course you will --

538
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:28,041
Breaks from school
over the summer.

539
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:31,030
No, Janie Freedman moved to
Virginia at the end of last year

540
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:32,632
'cause her dad got
some teaching job.

541
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:34,402
And she said she'd stay
in touch with everybody,

542
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:35,671
and she did for like a week.

543
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:37,622
And then after that,
nobody ever heard from her again.

544
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:38,632
It doesn't have
to be like that.

545
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,983
We're moving 2,000 miles away!
That's how it's gonna work!

546
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:43,610
- Mom is ruining my life!
- April.

547
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:46,770
I'm finally happy.
I finally have friends.

548
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:49,283
It took me forever,
and now I'm just gonna be

549
00:21:49,297 --> 00:21:52,983
that weird,
dorky loser girl all over again!

550
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:56,012
I know. Come on.
It's gonna be fine.

551
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:59,152
- I don't get it.
- What?

552
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:00,952
- 2002 party.
- It's a theme.

553
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:01,930
How is that a theme?

554
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:02,972
It's just supposed to be funny.

555
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,073
- I'm not laughing.
- Well, you don't have to go.

556
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:06,430
Why not 2001?

557
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:07,741
It could be 2001, I guess.

558
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:09,193
"Space odyssey" --
that's a theme.

559
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:11,283
People dress up like
astronauts or apes.

560
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:12,680
I don't know what
to tell you, Paris.

561
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:14,791
- Will there be dancing?
- Yes, it will be dancing.

562
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:15,803
What kind of dancing?

563
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:17,430
I don't know. 2002 dancing?

564
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:18,680
So we're talking
mostly hip-hop.

565
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:20,422
Paris, you don't have to
hip-hop-dance at this party.

566
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,543
I can hip-hop-dance.
Don't you worry.

567
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:24,411
Doyle and I will be
scorching the floorboards.

568
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,952
Looking forward to that.

569
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,963
- Hi, mom.
- So what are you gonna pledge me?

570
00:22:27,977 --> 00:22:29,760
- In the knitathon?
- Yeah, what do you say?

571
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:31,890
- Like 10 bucks a skein?
- How about $5?

572
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:33,230
- So, $15?
- Make it $3.

573
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:34,860
- $20 a skein?
- A buck 50.

574
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:36,611
- 25 smackeroos?
- 75 cents.

575
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:38,101
We have no idea how to haggle,
do we?

576
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,752
No idea. Why don't you just
put me down for $30 even?

577
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,842
I will not take less than $30,
and then you got a done deal.

578
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:43,950
The best I can do is $30.

579
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:45,523
All right, you give me $30,
and it's a deal.

580
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:46,940
Do I have to pledge dad, too?

581
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,320
No, no, he's just a spectator.
Although, you know what he's doing?

582
00:22:49,358 --> 00:22:51,060
He's going on a
man-date with Jackson.

583
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,760
Cute. A mandated man-date?

584
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:55,173
Yes, it was
suggested enthusiastically.

585
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:56,850
What is that you're
listening to?

586
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:59,951
That's Paris. She and Doyle are
threatening to scorch the floorboards

587
00:22:59,968 --> 00:23:01,532
at Lucy's party.

588
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,133
Aw. Poor floorboards.

589
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:05,441
Hey, how did all
the party prep go?

590
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:08,151
Good. We're just about ready
to party like it's 2002.

591
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,843
There's just one thing though --
this whole Marty debacle.

592
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,761
It's just so annoying
to be around him.

593
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:14,761
Is he still acting
all cold and weird?

594
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:16,811
Beyond cold and beyond weird.

595
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:20,021
You're a hard one to get over, kid,
you know. He probably just feels bad.

596
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:22,311
When guys feel rejected,
they act all cold and weird.

597
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:25,872
Yeah, but I rejected him,
if that's even what happened, years ago.

598
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:28,931
I mean, isn't there a statute of
limitations for being a jerk?

599
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:31,260
Marty just probably
feels awkward.

600
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,730
Maybe you should
try to be nice.

601
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:34,282
He's not exactly
being nice to me.

602
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:36,081
Well, you have to be
the bigger person.

603
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:37,541
Why doesn't he be
the bigger person?

604
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:39,972
Because you're 11 feet tall
and he's a mere mortal.

605
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,352
I hate being 11 feet tall.

606
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:43,940
I know.
It's hell finding jeans that fit, huh?

607
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:46,852
I got to go.
I got a man-date fashion disaster.

608
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,013
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

609
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:49,843
So, uh, $30 a skein?

610
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,901
- Total -- $30 total.
- Yeah.

611
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:53,001
Hey.

612
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:54,932
W-What?

613
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:56,193
Is that what you're wearing?

614
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:57,703
What? What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?

615
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:59,430
Nothing. It's just
that it's, um...

616
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:01,161
- What?
- ...black.

617
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:02,823
- It's a black shirt.
- Yeah.

618
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:04,013
Okay, then.

619
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:07,431
It's very Joaquin
Phoenix at the Oscars.

620
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,401
I have no clue what that means.

621
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,573
It's very fitted.

622
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:11,880
I should wear a shirt
that doesn't fit?

623
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:12,880
No.

624
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,121
- Should I tuck it in?
- No!

625
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:17,190
Why are you grimacing
at this shirt?!

626
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,190
Um... I don't know.

627
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,103
Maybe it's not the best thing to
wear on your man-date with Jackson.

628
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:24,710
Okay, first of all,
if you say "man-date" one more time,

629
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:26,501
there is no way in hell
I am leaving this house.

630
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:30,262
And second, last I knew, I was about
to go and have a beer with a farmer.

631
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:32,133
I don't think it really
matters what I'm wearing.

632
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:34,640
Oh, it is very important that
you make a good impression.

633
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:36,652
Lor, come on,
how great did our walk through town go?

634
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:38,683
You were all worried about that,
and everybody was nice.

635
00:24:38,715 --> 00:24:40,463
- They were nice.
- It went great.

636
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:41,961
- Eh.
- Didn't it?

637
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:43,342
- Nah.
- What are you saying?

638
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:46,911
I'm saying it didn't go so great.
They were cordial, they were polite.

639
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:47,851
But the wagon...

640
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:51,153
Was full of cleaning
supplies and shoe trees.

641
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:53,240
When Claude and Michael
Davies got married,

642
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,432
they got handmade clothing
and homemade baked goods,

643
00:24:56,446 --> 00:24:59,790
and the pizza guy
whittled them bookends

644
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:01,792
in the shape of
senegalese tigers.

645
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:03,341
That's a welcome wagon.

646
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:06,402
We got a "we're tolerating
that you're here" wagon.

647
00:25:06,427 --> 00:25:07,492
Sorry.

648
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:10,391
So, going out with Jackson
is important because...?

649
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:13,870
Jackson is loved.
Jackson is respected.

650
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:16,521
If you're in with Jackson,
you're in with Stars Hollow.

651
00:25:16,538 --> 00:25:18,900
Okay, maybe I could wear
the gray polo shirt.

652
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:20,901
I love that idea!

653
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:23,351
- What about the jeans?
- They're fine.

654
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:24,610
They're just a little tight.

655
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:26,800
All right,
I'll change the jeans.

656
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,073
The shoes?

657
00:25:28,088 --> 00:25:30,830
All right, I'll change the shoes.
I hate to say this out loud,

658
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:34,140
but all of a sudden, I'm very nervous
about my man-date with a farmer.

659
00:25:34,155 --> 00:25:36,723
You're gonna be great.

660
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:39,981
Not too much stuff in the hair!

661
00:25:40,395 --> 00:25:41,771
So, what do you think?

662
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:45,282
I'm down with any place where you can
throw your peanut shells on the floor.

663
00:25:45,297 --> 00:25:47,382
Not exactly a
Manhattan hot spot.

664
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:50,393
A beer in Stars Hollow tastes
just as good as a beer in Soho,

665
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:51,731
and it's a hell
of a lot cheaper.

666
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:52,990
It's a Microbrew.

667
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:54,813
They brew it right
here on the premises.

668
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:04,521
So, what's your best crop?
Do you have a favorite?

669
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:06,550
Don't get me started.
I love them all.

670
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,970
But it has been a
standout eggplant year.

671
00:26:09,016 --> 00:26:10,783
- Do you like eggplant?
- Yep.

672
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:13,553
Don't say another word.
I am your eggplant connection.

673
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:16,070
Guess I'm gonna have to get
rid of my other guy, then.

674
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:20,852
It's just -- it's just a joke.

675
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:23,641
Oh. Yeah.

676
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,502
- So, you and Lorelai, huh?
- Yeah.

677
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:39,841
That's quite an achievement. I mean,
many have tried, many have failed.

678
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,711
Yeah, I feel pretty lucky.

679
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:52,321
You know what I love about farming?
The commitment.

680
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,833
No shortcuts, no quitting.

681
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,770
You have got to be
there for your crops

682
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:58,311
morning, noon, and night.

683
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:01,903
I mean, you can have the
greatest soil and perfect seeds,

684
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:04,713
but if you are not
100% committed,

685
00:27:04,828 --> 00:27:07,113
you might as well pave
over those 32 acres

686
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,522
and build yourself a strip mall.
You know what I mean?

687
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,041
It's a lot of responsibility.

688
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:12,772
It sure is.

689
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:14,890
It sounds like you
really love farming.

690
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:15,991
I do.

691
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:18,033
Sookie and I, we both do.

692
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:19,782
Me too.

693
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:26,813
Yeahn okay. If you want to come by,
I'll be in all afternoon.

694
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:28,871
Great. I'll see you then. Bye.

695
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,361
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.

696
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:32,211
Sure. What's up?

697
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:35,003
Well, April --
she's pretty upset.

698
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:36,390
Yeah, I know.

699
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,101
I wanted to make sure we were
doing everything we could

700
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,642
to make it as easy as,
you know, it could be for her.

701
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:43,951
- So, what have you got in mind?
- Okay, well, I was thinking.

702
00:27:43,988 --> 00:27:46,232
Instead of pulling her out in
the middle of the school year,

703
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:50,141
maybe you could wait to move
till the end of the school year?

704
00:27:50,156 --> 00:27:51,793
And you don't think
I thought about that.

705
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,991
No, you could go back and forth,
and still be there for your mom,

706
00:27:54,026 --> 00:27:55,710
and I could help
covering for April here.

707
00:27:55,725 --> 00:28:00,103
No, I have to be out there full
time as soon as possible, Luke.

708
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:02,711
Oh, well, she could stay
with me to finish the year.

709
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:05,351
She's already been with me
for two months, you know?

710
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:07,101
I'd love it.
It would be great, actually.

711
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,532
Luke, I know you mean well,
but that's not gonna happen, okay?

712
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,622
I'm not splitting apart
from April for six months.

713
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:14,903
No, I understand.

714
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:18,583
Okay, so, maybe, you know,
we could buy her some plane tickets

715
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:22,140
so she'll know she's going
back and forth and when?

716
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:23,793
We can't make that plan now.

717
00:28:23,806 --> 00:28:25,850
No, it doesn't have to
include everything.

718
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,681
But, like, I already told
her she could stay with me

719
00:28:28,696 --> 00:28:30,752
for spring break 
and part of the summer, so if --

720
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:32,980
Whoa. You told her that?

721
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:35,063
- You actually said that?
- Yeah.

722
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:37,420
I have no idea what
we'll be doing then.

723
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:38,260
I just assumed that --

724
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:40,660
You have no right making
promises to my daughter.

725
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:41,662
I just wanted her--

726
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:44,821
I don't want you talking to her
about this again. Are we clear?

727
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:46,291
- Anna.
- No, Luke.

728
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:48,070
Listen, these are my decisions.

729
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:50,221
I'm not gonna have you
going behind my back,

730
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:52,770
making promises to
April that I can't keep.

731
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:55,662
So, are you saying
she's not coming back?

732
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:58,643
I am saying I'm not
ready to make decisions.

733
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,972
And they are my decisions to make,
not yours, Luke.

734
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,800
Now I'm gonna go.

735
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:10,292
Hello?

736
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:14,343
It's showtime, Luke!

737
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:16,660
What the hell's going on over there?
Is Liz okay?

738
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:18,093
She's amazing!

739
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:20,323
We're having a baby, baby!

740
00:29:20,336 --> 00:29:22,733
It's beautiful!
You got to get over here.

741
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:24,572
I'm on my way!

742
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,992
Free needles.
Free for everyone.

743
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:56,741
Free needles! Free needles!

744
00:29:56,758 --> 00:29:58,902
See? Who says Stars
Hollow's not progressive?

745
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,210
- Hey.
- Hey, you guys.

746
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:02,021
- Yummy.
- Hey, Jackson. What's up?

747
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:05,122
Hey. How's it going? So wednesday
night -- we still on to watch the game?

748
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,110
Sounds good.

749
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:08,312
All right, we're gonna stake out
some prime knitting real estate.

750
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:08,811
See you later.

751
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,412
- Save us a spot!
- We will.

752
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:11,722
You're seeing Jackson
wednesday, huh?

753
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:12,911
Yeah, we were thinking maybe.

754
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:14,423
- I guess that could work.
- What do you mean?

755
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:16,710
- I have some other plans for you.
- Plans?

756
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:19,943
Yeah, you got bird-watching with Morey,
darts with Andrew.

757
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:22,023
Ooh, and Glenn Belkin wanted
to have coffee with you.

758
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,782
He is the head coach of the
peewee little league teams.

759
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:26,002
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

760
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:28,722
He think he might have a plum
assistant-coaching job for you.

761
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:30,360
Assistant coach, huh?

762
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:32,342
All right, I'm feeling the
knitting vibes right here.

763
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,973
Hello, hello!

764
00:30:33,986 --> 00:30:36,550
Hiya, kids.
Boy, it's a chilly one, huh?

765
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,733
Welcome, fair citizens
of Stars Hollow.

766
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:41,423
We come together on this
glorious autumnal day

767
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:44,873
to rescue our beloved
muddy river bridge.

768
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:49,721
And the knitting will commence
at precisely 10:00 a.m.,

769
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:52,812
and we will knit unceasingly
until our long day's journey ends

770
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:54,962
at the stroke of 10:00 p.m.

771
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,742
Taylor, 10:00 a.m.
is 40 seconds away.

772
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:59,213
What? No.
I've got 3 1/2 more minutes.

773
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:01,842
I've timed this speech to
last exactly 3 1/2 minutes.

774
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:07,082
Um, a bridge is not merely a feat
of engineering and architecture.

775
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:08,641
A bridge is also a metaphor.

776
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:10,872
Taylor, I'm sorry.
Your watch is wrong.

777
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:14,373
I have precise atomic clock time.
28 seconds.

778
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:16,433
I'm with Kirk! 26 seconds!

779
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:17,772
But I just got this watch.

780
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:20,053
- Make that 22, 21.
- 20.

781
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:23,463
As I was saying, a bridge is a metaphor,
a meeting place between here and there,

782
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:27,481
between the past and the future.
The Golden Gate, the Brooklyn...

783
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:29,240
to raise funds...

784
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:32,011
- our duty as citizens!
- Nine seconds!

785
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:34,640
Real-time accounting
of the funds approved.

786
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:35,372
Seven seconds!

787
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:36,762
- As we strive toward --
- Six!

788
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:40,983
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

789
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:43,531
Oh, fine! Go ahead and knit!

790
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:53,032
Thank you! Thanks so much.

791
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:54,323
- Hey.
- Hi.

792
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:56,583
How are you enjoying
your first legal drink?

793
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:57,982
Third, actually.

794
00:31:57,997 --> 00:32:01,903
I like it, although I kind
of miss being a lawbreaker.

795
00:32:02,827 --> 00:32:05,061
Oh, my god. It's Paris Geller.

796
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:07,653
- I told you.
- You totally delivered.

797
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:08,783
Who's the dude?

798
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:10,002
That's her boyfriend -- Doyle.

799
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:12,191
- I'm fascinated.
- Go talk to her.

800
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:14,042
- Really?
- Yes, it's your party.

801
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:14,712
How do I look?

802
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,712
You look tiara'ed,
21, and fabulous.

803
00:32:18,117 --> 00:32:21,443
Hi! Thank you for
coming to my party.

804
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,180
Barkeep, I'll have an upside-down
tequila slammer with a twist.

805
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:34,292
I don't know how to make that.

806
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:36,491
Yeah, I just made it up.

807
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:41,381
Really? Is this the
way it's gonna be?

808
00:32:41,397 --> 00:32:44,551
I say something, and you grunt
and make me feel like an idiot?

809
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:45,780
Really? That's it?

810
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:47,092
What do you want me to say?

811
00:32:47,105 --> 00:32:48,861
Well, what I would
like you to say

812
00:32:48,877 --> 00:32:50,881
is that you've put me in a
really difficult position,

813
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:53,561
and the least you can do
is not be a jerk about it.

814
00:32:53,587 --> 00:32:54,731
I'm sorry.

815
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:55,781
Yeah?

816
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:56,911
Yeah.

817
00:32:56,928 --> 00:32:58,963
So you're done being a jerk?

818
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,391
Y-Yeah, I-I'm done.

819
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:01,291
Good.

820
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:04,452
So you still want that
upside-down tequila slammer?

821
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:06,232
- With a twist.
- Right.

822
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,330
- Probably has tequila in it.
- Yeah.

823
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,243
Um, the upside-down part,
I'll have to improvise.

824
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:16,300
But the slammer and the twist
are pretty straightforward.

825
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:18,020
You might want to stand back.

826
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:18,980
Oh, okay.

827
00:33:22,155 --> 00:33:25,823
Go, Paris! Go, Paris!
Go, Paris!

828
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,562
Go, Paris! Go, Paris!

829
00:33:31,787 --> 00:33:34,541
Shh! It's okay, sweet girl.

830
00:33:34,557 --> 00:33:36,600
Y-You sure about
the name "Doula"?

831
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:39,520
She's such a Doula.
Isn't that right, gorgeous?

832
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:41,231
- It's cute, right?
- Yeah, no no.

833
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:42,572
What's that, Doula?

834
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,543
I want my uncle
Luke to hold me.

835
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:48,350
Oh, no, no, no. You keep her.

836
00:33:48,366 --> 00:33:50,000
Please! Uncle Lukey!

837
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:51,591
- No, really.
- Come on, Luke.

838
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:53,312
I-I don't have to.

839
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:55,090
I want my uncle
Lukey to hold me!

840
00:33:55,107 --> 00:33:56,771
Okay. Okay.

841
00:33:56,788 --> 00:33:58,733
- Here you go, Doula.
- Here we go.

842
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:01,212
- Look at her.
- Hey, Doula.

843
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:04,460
Isn't she beautiful? Look at her eyes.
She's got Liz's eyes.

844
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:05,811
It's true.

845
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:09,840
And --
and aunt Sissy's chin, right?

846
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:12,532
- That's totally Sissy's chin.
- No, Sissy was adopted.

847
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,260
- So?
- So.

848
00:34:15,268 --> 00:34:19,981
Well, I-I don't know how she does it,
but she's got her chin.

849
00:34:22,206 --> 00:34:23,992
What do you think, Luke?

850
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:25,801
She's great.

851
00:34:25,827 --> 00:34:28,263
That's your uncle Luke.

852
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,112
And Luke's daughter
is your cousin April.

853
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,950
Now, I bet April is gonna be
your number-one babysitter.

854
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:35,633
Am I right, Luke?

855
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:37,813
Yeah. Sure.

856
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,810
$2,200! Not bad, people!
Not good, exactly, but not bad.

857
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:45,302
And we have seven more hours to make
up the rest, so keep on knitting!

858
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:47,932
And as you do,
think of the bridge!

859
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:49,293
Who wants coffee?

860
00:34:49,306 --> 00:34:50,632
Is that a rhetorical question?

861
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:52,023
Thank you, Christopher.

862
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:53,660
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

863
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:54,952
Not without doping.

864
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:57,132
You guys don't talk like that!
Think of the bridge.

865
00:34:57,147 --> 00:34:59,311
We'll never be able to look it in
the I-bar again if you let it down.

866
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,482
How's it going?

867
00:35:00,496 --> 00:35:04,233
Well, I can't tell if my
hands are cramping or numb,

868
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:07,013
but they just keep knitting. So I
guess I'm trying not to think about it,

869
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:09,470
although I guess, right now,
I am thinking about it.

870
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:12,213
Maybe scheduling an
outdoor event in november

871
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:13,793
wasn't such a great move.

872
00:35:13,805 --> 00:35:16,163
It was a great move --
a Fred-and-Ginger-type move.

873
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:17,862
It's just a brisk fall day.

874
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:19,620
Nah, it's a bad move,

875
00:35:19,637 --> 00:35:22,712
but it's part of a great
tradition of bad moves by Taylor.

876
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:24,983
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

877
00:35:24,996 --> 00:35:30,262
I just received a
donation of $7,800!

878
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:33,150
Thanks very much to Stars
Hollow's newest resident,

879
00:35:33,168 --> 00:35:36,772
Christopher Hayden, for bringing
us up to our goal of $10,000!

880
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:37,382
Honey?

881
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:38,832
Christopher, you did that?

882
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,282
Yeah. Well, yeah, I --

883
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:43,800
Well, tha-- thank you.
Uh, i-it was really...

884
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:46,131
Generous. It's generous, right?

885
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:47,323
Yeah, generous.

886
00:35:47,335 --> 00:35:48,450
Thanks, Christopher.

887
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:50,053
You're welcome.
I just figured --

888
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,322
So what?
Do we stop knitting now?

889
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,730
Okay, pack it up, people.

890
00:35:52,748 --> 00:35:54,420
I guess we stop knitting now.

891
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:57,361
We've reached our goal.
Our work is done here.

892
00:35:57,376 --> 00:36:00,392
If we get that llama back in the next
half-hour, we're gonna save a bundle.

893
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,762
Wait, you guys, what are you doing?
W-Why are you leaving?

894
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:03,833
Well, you heard Taylor.

895
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:06,063
Yeah, but nobody ever listens to Taylor.
Come on, we got to keep knitting.

896
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:08,052
- It's seven more hours.
- What's the point?!

897
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,963
The point is, it's fun.
It's a festival.

898
00:36:09,977 --> 00:36:12,863
We haven't even got rowdy. we haven't
even wrapped Taylor in yarn yet.

899
00:36:12,877 --> 00:36:15,023
- Like a big Taylor cozy.
- Yeah.

900
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:18,241
But we already got all the money.
So, thanks very much, Christopher.

901
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:19,193
You're welcome.

902
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,400
Gypsy?

903
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:22,403
7,800 buckaroos.

904
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:25,070
Wow. You must really love
bridges, Christopher.

905
00:36:25,087 --> 00:36:26,233
What are you doing?

906
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:27,810
I'm gonna go catch a movie.

907
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:31,380
Wait a minute.
Where is your Stars Hollow spirit, huh?

908
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,820
Where's the love of knitting
just for knitting's sake?

909
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:35,210
At the movies?

910
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:36,991
- Sorry, honey.
- Yeah.

911
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:38,541
I wonder what's playing.

912
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:40,690
I don't know, but I'll bet
it's nice and toasty in there.

913
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:41,930
Thanks again, Christopher.

914
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:44,052
Sure. Happy to help.

915
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:47,961
Okay, let's get those needles down!
And careful, there, fellas!

916
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:50,961
Just because they're decorative
doesn't mean they're not sharp.

917
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:01,171
How is she still dancing?

918
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,002
Paris?

919
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:03,380
No -- Lucy.

920
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:04,811
Paris I understand,

921
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:08,070
'cause Paris has been training for
this like it's an olympic event.

922
00:37:08,086 --> 00:37:10,411
But Lucy?
Lucy weighs 11 pounds,

923
00:37:10,426 --> 00:37:12,532
and I'm pretty sure most
of that is tequila by now.

924
00:37:12,548 --> 00:37:14,280
The girl loves to move.

925
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:17,351
Oh, buzz-cut boys
going through.

926
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,753
Mmm! I'm going in.
I've got time for one or two

927
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:21,890
more awkward interactions
before the night is through.

928
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:23,050
Nice.

929
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,942
The bar is closed!

930
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:29,053
You finally quit.

931
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:30,722
Nope, just ran out of booze.

932
00:37:30,735 --> 00:37:32,450
I think I drank most of it.

933
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:36,663
That upside twisted slammer
was living up to its name, man.

934
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:38,580
I don't know if I'm more
twisted or slammed.

935
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:41,130
I'm both.
I think I had three of them.

936
00:37:41,145 --> 00:37:42,942
Or was it four?

937
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,512
You know,
the last time I saw you drunk,

938
00:37:44,545 --> 00:37:46,943
you were passed out and
naked outside my dorm room.

939
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:51,080
So, the truth comes out
after all these years.

940
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:53,743
- You checked me out.
- I did not.

941
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:56,682
- It was uncomfortable and weird.
- Well, it's for the best.

942
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:58,892
I was quite the
scrawny freshman.

943
00:37:58,905 --> 00:38:01,481
I think I actually
weighed 98 pounds.

944
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:03,762
But, you know, now...

945
00:38:03,777 --> 00:38:06,052
- You've been working out.
- Can't you tell?

946
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:09,503
I'm huge. I'm massive.
I'm Marty Schwarzenegger.

947
00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:11,852
I can tell.
You're looking good.

948
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:14,232
And you are more
beautiful than ever.

949
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:24,151
Um, you should be
out there with Lucy.

950
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:34,432
Hi!

951
00:38:39,098 --> 00:38:43,581
Why should I feel bad that I donated
$7,000 to help save the bridge?

952
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:44,382
You shouldn't.

953
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:47,433
I don't. I thought the point
was to save the bridge.

954
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:50,681
Well, the point was to
save it with knitting.

955
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,342
- That doesn't make any --
- I know it doesn't make any sense.

956
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,121
That's Stars Hollow.
That's just how it is.

957
00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:55,812
It's hard for outsiders
to understand.

958
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:57,422
So I'm an outsider?

959
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:58,722
For now.

960
00:38:58,738 --> 00:39:00,191
I thought I was
doing a good thing.

961
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:02,972
I know. You just don't have to
drop all that money like that.

962
00:39:02,988 --> 00:39:05,751
- I know I don't have to.
- You don't have to try so hard

963
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:07,640
to get people to like you.
What?

964
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:09,041
- That's funny.
- Why?

965
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,813
'Cause you're the one who's
making me try so hard.

966
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:12,830
Bird-watching,
backgammon, darts,

967
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:14,903
assistant-managing a
peewee baseball team?

968
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:15,983
I just want --

969
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:17,783
I know.
You want people to like me.

970
00:39:17,797 --> 00:39:19,730
You know what?
I'm a likable guy.

971
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:23,731
I always have been. I may not be the
smartest guy or the toughest guy,

972
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:25,183
but I'm the guy
that people like.

973
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:26,191
You are?

974
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,100
And you know why people in
Stars Hollow are gonna like me?

975
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:29,820
Why?

976
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:31,791
Because I love you.

977
00:39:31,807 --> 00:39:34,100
And I'm gonna be here,
loving you.

978
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:36,233
- You are?
- You bet.

979
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,090
You know, when you're a farmer,

980
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:40,291
you got to be there
for your crops.

981
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:42,291
It's not about the
seeds or the soil.

982
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:44,150
It's about being there,
being committed,

983
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:46,630
all day, every day, forever.

984
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:48,601
- Farmer, huh?
- Why not?

985
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:50,802
You know what, Mr.
"Doesn't seem like he knows

986
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:52,763
what he's talking about but
is actually pretty wise"?

987
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:56,832
What's that, Mrs. "Goes through 500
emotions every hour of the day"?

988
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,551
I love you a lot.

989
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,363
Yeah, you're okay, too.

990
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:21,670
- Hey.
- Hey.

991
00:40:23,315 --> 00:40:24,852
- April's not here.
- I know.

992
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:27,532
She's sleeping at
Gabrielle Wilder's tonight.

993
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,372
So, what's up?

994
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:32,101
I also know that Gabrielle
has a peanut allergy,

995
00:40:32,116 --> 00:40:33,833
and before I drop her off,

996
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:36,803
I check that April isn't
packing a snickers bar.

997
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:39,680
I also know that she likes
Gabby's coin collection,

998
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:42,571
so I thought I might take her
over to a coin shop in Stamford,

999
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:44,401
'cause she'd like it.

1000
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:45,831
What are you doing here, Luke?

1001
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:49,061
You know, you're always telling me that
I can't do this with your daughter

1002
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:50,771
and that I can't do that
with your daughter.

1003
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:53,532
Well, she's not just
your daughter, Anna.

1004
00:40:53,545 --> 00:40:54,780
She's my daughter, too.

1005
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:56,790
- Luke --
- No. No.

1006
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:59,172
I know I wasn't around
for all those years.

1007
00:40:59,186 --> 00:41:01,190
But, you know,
that was your decision.

1008
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:02,753
That was your choice, Anna.

1009
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:04,742
And, frankly,
it was a damn lousy one.

1010
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:08,313
Okay, I didn't get to see her
born or take her first steps

1011
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:10,973
or take her to her first
day of school -- none of it.

1012
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:14,230
And I can never get any of that back.
It's gone!

1013
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:18,593
But that's not gonna happen anymore.
That, I can guarantee you.

1014
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:21,341
- What are you saying?
- That she's my kid, all right?

1015
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:23,893
She's our kid.
She's not just yours.

1016
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:26,030
And I'm not gonna let
you treat me this way.

1017
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:29,592
I'm her father.
God, why do I even have to say that?

1018
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:33,310
I mean, April and I,
we have this relationship, okay?

1019
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:35,862
A-And you can't
just decide things.

1020
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:38,011
That's not how
this works, okay?

1021
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:41,401
I mean, we have to make decisions
together, decisions about April.

1022
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,282
And I will fight you.

1023
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:46,581
I will fight you for that,
Anna, if I have to.

1024
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:48,322
I have rights.

1025
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:51,962
I'm her father,
and I have rights.

1026
00:41:56,978 --> 00:42:00,710
