1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:01,696
You're looking good, dad.

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,079
I'd say you shaved a few
minutes off your last lap.

3
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:05,374
If I had to guess,

4
00:00:05,404 --> 00:00:08,083
I'd think you're clocking in
at about a 45-minute mile,

5
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:10,166
which puts you just
behind Mrs. Abalone.

6
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:11,247
Lorelai, really.

7
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,968
I think that's an
unfair comparison.

8
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:16,251
Mrs. Abalone had her bypass
two whole days before mine.

9
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:18,735
No no, no excuses.
You just have to dig a little deeper.

10
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:21,990
Come on, grandpa, just visualize Mrs.
Abalone eating your dust.

11
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,349
- Rory, honestly.
- No, it's all right.

12
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:25,975
How's this?

13
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:29,531
Wow, I would say we have
a new slow-walk leader

14
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:31,201
in the cardiac-recovery wing.

15
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:32,232
Hey, do you hear that?

16
00:00:32,626 --> 00:00:33,962
What, the crowd cheering?

17
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:36,620
Whoo! Yeah, grandpa!

18
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:38,712
Would you two stop?
You're making a scene.

19
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,911
Mr. Gilmore,
congratulations on your recent victory.

20
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:43,841
Any opinions about the
allegations of steroid use

21
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,113
among your fellow athletes?

22
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:48,052
I consider myself proof
positive that it can be done...

23
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:49,320
and done clean.

24
00:00:49,355 --> 00:00:51,251
Richard, must you
encourage them?

25
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,421
Excuse me, Emily.

26
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,883
I'm getting a little stir
crazy in this place.

27
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:56,833
You'll be getting out
of here soon enough.

28
00:00:56,865 --> 00:01:00,383
Oh, I forgot to tell you -- Kate and
Daniel Urman called to send
their regards.

29
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:01,891
Oh, hey, Mr. Gavelle.

30
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,050
Looking good, Ira.

31
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:05,473
They sent a lovely floral
arrangement to the house.

32
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:08,600
Although personally I find white
roses a little uninspiring.

33
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:11,581
I think my favorite arrangement is
still the one that Christopher sent.

34
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:14,560
It was very tasteful and
appropriate and so colorful.

35
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:17,222
I mean, we're not in mourning,
for heaven's sake.

36
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:20,293
I'm getting very tired of white flowers.
You thanked him for us?

37
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:22,291
Uh, yeah.
Hey, you know that young guy

38
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:25,190
who's been visiting miss
Santiago in room 236?

39
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:26,683
Not her son. Her boyfriend.

40
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:27,760
- No!
- Yes.

41
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:30,021
Girls, I don't think that's
any of our business.

42
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:32,231
But he's at least 20
years younger than she is.

43
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,703
- 32 according to the night nurse.
- 32?

44
00:01:34,737 --> 00:01:37,430
He's just a boy. What could they
possibly have to talk about?

45
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:40,210
I don't think they're doing a lot of
talking, if you know what I mean.

46
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:42,352
I most certainly do
not know what you mean.

47
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:43,692
All right, that's enough.

48
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:45,461
Rory, when are you
heading back to Yale?

49
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,671
Yeah, you should
hit the road, huh?

50
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,263
Yeah. Remember,
you owe me a full report on the T.A.

51
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:50,922
that's taking over my spot.

52
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:54,513
The whole semester should
concentrate on microeconomics,

53
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,720
so if this Culbertson fellow
even mentions Ben Bernanke,

54
00:01:57,757 --> 00:01:59,673
- give me a call.
- I promise I will.

55
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,971
But actually, I was thinking maybe
I'd hang out here with you guys

56
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,691
a little longer and
go back next week.

57
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:05,603
- What?
- Don't be silly, Rory.

58
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:08,072
- You're going back today.
- I've only missed two days.

59
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:09,513
Two days? That's plenty.

60
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,390
But it's just the
beginning of school.

61
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:12,851
It doesn't matter.
It's not a big deal.

62
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:15,850
It is a very big deal.
Plus, we already decided.

63
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:19,150
Yeah, but haven't you ever decided
something and then changed your mind?

64
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:22,180
Honey, listen,
everything is gonna be fine.

65
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:24,843
Grandpa's doing great.
There's no reason for you to stay.

66
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,433
What if he needs something?

67
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:27,932
Grandma has got
this place wired.

68
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:30,422
She's already slipped the nurses
something to keep the ice chips coming.

69
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:32,070
- Really, he's fine.
- Okay.

70
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:34,122
- What about you?
- What about me?

71
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,993
I  don't want you to
have to go home alone.

72
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:37,201
Oh, I'm fine.

73
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:38,791
Yeah, but dad hasn't been home.

74
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:41,400
Well, he's with G.G.
at his mom's.

75
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:43,022
Okay, but for how long?

76
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:45,333
I don't know, honey.
He just said he needed some time.

77
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:46,601
How much time?

78
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:49,432
He didn't say.
Look, I've had my hands full here,

79
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,642
so I really didn't want to
get into it over the phone.

80
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:54,071
Do you want me to call him
and just see what's going on?

81
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,681
Absolutely not.

82
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:58,712
Well, what is his problem?
It was just a character reference.

83
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,540
Hey, don't worry about it.
It's between me and your dad.

84
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:03,661
We're gonna work it out, okay?

85
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:04,913
Okay.

86
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:07,683
"Okay" like you're
gonna go back to school

87
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:09,541
like our original deal?

88
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:11,452
I will go back to school.

89
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,292
However, for future reference,

90
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:15,730
the next time we have a conversation
where I say, "maybe friday,"

91
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:17,682
that does not mean that
we have struck a deal.

92
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:21,270
See, I remember you saying "absolutely,
definitely, positively friday."

93
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:24,002
Oh, so it's your
word against mine?

94
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,371
It's a classic case of she said,
she said.

95
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:28,811
Hi, Mrs. Santiago.

96
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:31,020
Her boyfriend, really?

97
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:32,390
She's got a nice butt.

98
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,711
- What?
- What?

99
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,390
It's the hospital gowns.
Believe me.

100
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:37,412
I wish I did not know that.

101
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:34,471
- You're back.
- I'm back.

102
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:35,453
Thanks for the call.

103
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,972
- Hey, how's your dad?
- Oh, he's great, thanks.

104
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:40,852
How was the Wilson wedding?
I can't believe she added 15 people

105
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,290
-  at the last minute.
- I know, right?

106
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:44,180
It took us an hour to get
the extra rooms ready,

107
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,780
but we sent welcome baskets up like
you said, and everyone seemed fine.

108
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:48,330
- Even the mother-in-law?
- She was awful.

109
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:49,503
She's a beast.

110
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,850
- Hey!
- There she is!

111
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:53,870
So?

112
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:57,190
Well, he made his nurse go get him
a Wall Street journal this morning.

113
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:58,463
That's good!
That's a good sign!

114
00:04:58,497 --> 00:04:59,713
Yeah, he's doing better.

115
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:01,770
And thanks for the cookies.
They were a big hit.

116
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:03,620
Oh, good. With these cravings,

117
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:06,502
all I feel like cooking is chili with
cayenne pepper and extra onions,

118
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:09,081
but I didn't think chili with cayenne
pepper and extra onions cookies

119
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:10,631
would go over well
with your parents.

120
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,873
Tell them it's exotic and expensive,
and they'll love it.

121
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,841
The little one has
a spicy palate, huh?

122
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:16,462
Yeah, except for the
cauliflower thing.

123
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:18,881
He or she has got a
huge cauliflower thing.

124
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:21,120
Also not a good cookie.
Oh, hi.

125
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,443
Hello, Lorelai. Welcome back.

126
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,731
Thanks. What's with the dog?

127
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:25,751
Why is that here?

128
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:27,542
I assume you're
talking about Paw-Paw.

129
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,842
I'm talking about the furry thing 
that you know you're not supposed

130
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:32,593
to bring to work due to the fact
that many of our guests do not enjoy

131
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,043
finding dog hairs in
their lobster bisque.

132
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:36,670
I had no choice but to
bring him in today.

133
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,011
Paw-Paw could not
be left alone.

134
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,350
His brother Chin Chin
passed away last night.

135
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:41,831
Michel, I'm so sorry.

136
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,721
Paw-Paw is beside himself.

137
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:46,890
I'm really sorry, Michel.

138
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:48,781
You didn't even like him.

139
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:51,303
Sure,  I did. That little guy!

140
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:53,893
You called him a
walking flea circus.

141
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,620
Chin Chin was a
wonderful dog, Michel.

142
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:57,311
Thank you.

143
00:05:57,345 --> 00:06:00,380
Yeah. Remember at
the labor day picnic,

144
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,129
I dropped my sandwich,
and I was like,

145
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,335
"oh, great,
now I've got to clean this all up."

146
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,431
And Chin Chin just came
in and scooped it up,

147
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,102
and saved me that trip.

148
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,632
That was Paw-Paw.

149
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,950
What? No!

150
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:14,280
I was standing right there.

151
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:16,151
That was Paw-Paw who
ate your sandwich.

152
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,450
Chin Chin didn't
even like barbecue.

153
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:20,553
Oh, well, still.

154
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:23,873
Still what?! Are your two stinky
little children interchangeable?

155
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:25,392
Hey! Excuse me!

156
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,271
What Sookie means to say
and what I mean to say

157
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:29,152
is we're very sorry
for your loss.

158
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:30,790
Thank you, Lorelai.

159
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:33,963
He was always such
a sweet little dog.

160
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:36,651
What a personality. So warm.

161
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:40,861
Warm. Yes.
And, um, fuzzy and...

162
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:43,502
I just can't believe he's gone.

163
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:47,410
It doesn't feel real.
I miss him so much.

164
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:50,233
Well, you should have a
memorial or something.

165
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,312
Yeah, that's a good idea.

166
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:54,433
Oh. I suppose it is.

167
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:57,072
Yeah, it'll give you and
Paw-Paw a chance to say goodbye.

168
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:58,651
That might be nice.

169
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:00,263
Could you do it by tomorrow?

170
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:01,533
Me? What?

171
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:05,001
If you're going to put together
a memorial, it should be soon.

172
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:08,531
Uh... yeah, sure.
Tomorrow would be fine.

173
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:10,162
All right, that sounds fine.

174
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,093
Well, I guess I should get
started on the guest list.

175
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:16,561
There are so many people who
will want to pay their respects.

176
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:18,252
Paw-Paw. Come on.

177
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,632
Any objections to holding
a chow funeral, speak now,

178
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:23,770
although it's already too late.

179
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:27,051
Oh, it's a nice idea, though.
He was so upset.

180
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,380
I could have sworn the
sandwich dog was Chin Chin.

181
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:31,291
It was hard to tell the difference
between them. They were both so --

182
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,072
- Aloof.
- I was gonna say obnoxious.

183
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:33,881
That too.

184
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,863
I think Chin Chin was the one who
was aloof, obnoxious, and a biter.

185
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:38,180
That's right.

186
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:41,251
Oh, good. You're back.

187
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:42,450
Yeah, I'm back.

188
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:44,521
I went to the Sigma
Chi party without you.

189
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:46,271
I was going to wait,
but I didn't know when you'd be back,

190
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:48,262
so I decided to just
go ahead and do it.

191
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:49,613
Well, that's fine, Paris.

192
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:50,590
I know it's fine.

193
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:51,801
It was on the schedule.

194
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:54,602
What was I supposed to do,
stop my life because you were gone?

195
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:57,012
No, but I'm glad that you went.

196
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:58,511
That's great. How was it?

197
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,941
Asinine. You didn't
miss anything.

198
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,690
Here, I wrote a summary.

199
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:05,792
And here's your mail.
I flagged your bills.

200
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:07,253
Oh, thanks, Paris.

201
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:10,262
So, how are you?

202
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:11,601
Oh, I'm okay.

203
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:13,813
- And Richard?
- Oh, he's really good.

204
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:16,471
They're gonna keep him for another
night, then he should be able to
go home.

205
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:18,082
It was a myocardial infarction?

206
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:19,290
Yeah, a heart attack.

207
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:21,470
- Is he going on beta blockers?
- I don't know.

208
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:23,171
If he can tolerate them,
he should.

209
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:26,400
They reduce the risk of death
following a heart attack by about 25%.

210
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,930
Of course, he'll have to
implement a few lifestyle changes,

211
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,572
but you tell him if Bill Clinton can
give up cheese fries and pork grits,

212
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:33,401
he can get by without
his 5:00 martini.

213
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:34,721
I will pass that along.

214
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:35,701
Good.

215
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:37,933
Anyway, I'm glad he's okay.

216
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:40,361
Yeah, me too. That was scary.

217
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:41,423
I'll bet.

218
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:44,461
So, I downloaded your reading lists,
and I went to the bookstore

219
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:47,271
and hid copies of your books so you
wouldn't get stuck buying used ones

220
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,481
with some idiot's
comments in the margins.

221
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,611
And here,
I made you a copy of the notes

222
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:54,290
from our "History of feminism" seminar
since you missed the first class.

223
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:57,301
Oh, thanks, Paris.
What's with the blacked-out section?

224
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,331
I'm happy to share the things the
teacher said to the general public,

225
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:03,001
but I'm not about to share my
insights into the material.

226
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:04,721
Don't give me that look.

227
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,453
If there's one thing I
learned in that first lecture

228
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,570
it's there's not room for
many women at the top.

229
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:10,351
Gloria Steinem
would be so proud.

230
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:12,590
Whatever. The facts
speak for themselves.

231
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,911
Nadine Strossen is
the head of the ACLU,

232
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:17,340
not Nadine Strossen and
her very best friend.

233
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,952
Oh, we're supposed to choose
a paper topic by next friday,

234
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,651
but I'm sure you can swing an extension
if you play the grandfather card.

235
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,272
I will have a topic picked. I don't
need to play the grandfather card

236
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:26,732
because my grandfather is fine.

237
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:27,781
Okay.

238
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,343
So, are you ready to trade?

239
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,103
- Trade what?
- R�sum�s.

240
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,392
It's on the schedule.
We're supposed to trade r�sum�s today

241
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:35,801
and get back to each other by tomorrow
morning with questions or comments.

242
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:36,853
I forgot.

243
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:38,922
I've been at the
hospital for two days.

244
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,812
So much for not playing
the grandfather card.

245
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,572
No, there's no card.

246
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:44,572
I just mean that I haven't
gotten around to it.

247
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:46,432
I will get you my
r�sum� by tomorrow.

248
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,883
Fine. By "r�sum�" you
mean "r�sum�s," right?

249
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:50,980
How many do we need?

250
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,851
I have 21 versions,

251
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:56,102
each one tailored to a particular
job in a particular field --

252
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,292
grad school,
law school, med school,

253
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,161
fellowships, jobs
on newspapers,

254
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:01,852
jobs on the business
side of newspapers,

255
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:03,851
jobs working for
multimedia conglomerations,

256
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:06,072
jobs working for
"the little guy,"

257
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:09,213
jobs in the public sector, i.e.
internships in Washington,

258
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:11,482
for which there are three different
versions based on whether or not

259
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:14,780
I'm  applying to work for a democrat,
a republican, or a Joe Lieberman.

260
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:17,422
Wow. When did this get here?

261
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:19,163
Yesterday. Anyway,
like I was saying,

262
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:21,903
it's important to tailor your
r�sum�s to your potential employers.

263
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,472
You think Harvard law school is
looking for the same skill set as Nasa?

264
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:26,141
Probably not. Funnily enough,

265
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:28,841
neither Harvard law school
nor Nasa are on my list.

266
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,500
So, I'll get you my
r�sum�s tonight.

267
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:35,662
Oh, look, it's from Logan --
second-semester senior survival kit.

268
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:38,952
There's a datebook
and a stress ball,

269
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:42,012
a magnetic poetry kit,
bags and bags of coffee beans,

270
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:44,213
something called an
inspirational marble keepsake

271
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,960
with the words "anything's
possible" engraved on it.

272
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:49,211
Don't worry.
I'll keep it in my room.

273
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,651
Oh! This is a beer funnel.

274
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:55,252
I saw one at the
party last night.

275
00:10:58,095 --> 00:10:59,652
Logan, thank you.

276
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:00,833
You got the package?

277
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:04,281
Yeah, finally someone gave me
an inspirational keepsake.

278
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:07,481
Are you inspired?
Next year, baby, anything's possible.

279
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:10,053
Yeah, I hear you loud
and clear and heavy.

280
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,641
Good, because the
world is your oyster,

281
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:13,851
to quote the other inspirational
keepsake I was considering.

282
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,952
So how's it being back?
How are you doing? You doing okay?

283
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:17,191
Yeah, I'm fine.

284
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:18,861
Because if you want me
to come up tonight...

285
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:20,393
No, I'll see you on sunday.

286
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:21,932
Okay, but if you 
change your mind...

287
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:22,891
You'll be here.

288
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:24,743
Logan, I cannot
thank you enough.

289
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:27,722
You've just been really great
throughout this whole thing.

290
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:29,252
No way.
You don't get to thank me for that.

291
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,592
It comes with the territory.

292
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:32,481
Rory, my 10:00
coffee just showed.

293
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:34,743
Go. I've got a 10:00
cereal waiting for me.

294
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,600
- I'll call you later?
- Sounds good.

295
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:38,473
-  I love you.
- You, too.

296
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:43,012
What's with the gooney look?

297
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,333
Your face.
It's right out of a Harlequin romance.

298
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:47,653
He's just been so great.

299
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:49,990
I mean, he's really been there
for me for the past couple days.

300
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,780
I had to practically send him
away from the hospital yesterday.

301
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:55,932
I know. It's amazing. I never
thought you guys were gonna last.

302
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,791
- What?
- I'm just being honest.

303
00:11:57,826 --> 00:11:59,123
Logan Huntzberger?

304
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:02,263
Between the women and the drinking, that
kid was on the Colin Farrell freeway

305
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,531
about to pull over into the
Robert Downey Jr. rest stop.

306
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:05,591
I get it, Paris.

307
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,833
What I'm trying to say is,
he's changed.

308
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,653
You changed him. It's amazing.

309
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,330
I'm rarely this wrong.

310
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:12,511
Well, thanks.

311
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:13,760
Don't get me wrong.

312
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:15,783
Doyle was quite the ladies' man,
as well.

313
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,992
Now, he's down for the count.

314
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,932
The other night, he wanted to play
"Let's think up baby names" in bed.

315
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,492
- Really?
- Yeah.

316
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,102
I mean, let's face it.
We took two wild stallions,

317
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:26,120
and we broke them.

318
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:27,951
I don't think I
really "broke" Logan.

319
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:29,203
Oh, you broke him.

320
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:30,412
You broke him hard.

321
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:32,561
You can open the gate,
and he's not going to bolt.

322
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:35,161
You can kick him with a spur,
and he's not going to spook.

323
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:36,320
You own him.

324
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,493
Paris, stop. That's ridiculous.

325
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:40,780
I think I'm gonna go
work on my r�sum�s.

326
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:42,721
Hey, let's make them go
out and get tattoos.

327
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:44,350
It'll be like we branded them.

328
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:47,891
It says here "12% sales
tax." And that is?

329
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:50,422
The percentage of sales tax the
state of Connecticut mandates.

330
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,561
I know. It's outrageous.

331
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:52,842
Harold, I've already
paid the bill.

332
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:54,130
And this is the room rate.

333
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,510
Times three nights. Yep. 

334
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:59,063
Okay, and what is this charge for,
exactly, under room service?

335
00:12:59,096 --> 00:13:02,021
That's... for the room
service that you ordered.

336
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,462
Would you like to
see an itemized copy?

337
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:04,760
- No.
- Yes.

338
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:07,442
That's it. I'm leaving.
Thank you for your patience.

339
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:08,652
No problem.

340
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,490
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

341
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:11,793
Thank  you. Bye.

342
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:14,021
- So, are you ready to talk?
- Oh, sure.

343
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,322
Let's go to the library.

344
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:16,400
Okay.

345
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:21,021
Please sit down.

346
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:29,591
Okay, I'm ready to hear
your ideas for the funeral.

347
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:33,400
Okay. Um... gosh, our ideas.

348
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,710
Well, we've got so many ideas.

349
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,773
So, so many.

350
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:41,241
Why don't you start with,
uh, the ideas?

351
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:44,633
Okay. Um, well,
first of all, we thought

352
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,992
- we'd put him in a box.
- A box?

353
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,273
- A bag?
- A bag?

354
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:51,003
Sorry, animal disposal is
not my area of expertise.

355
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:53,910
Chin Chin has been cremated
at the animal hospital.

356
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:57,082
After the memorial, his ashes will
be scattered under the poplar tree

357
00:13:57,117 --> 00:14:00,452
behind my house where he
so often went to think.

358
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:02,253
Oh, okay. Cool.

359
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:04,010
A tree. That's nice.

360
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:07,231
Why don't you talk me through
the particulars of the event?

361
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,700
Right. Okay.

362
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:13,031
Well, we, uh,
thought we would have it here.

363
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:14,572
That sounds good.

364
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:16,952
- Okay. During lunch.
- During lunch?

365
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:18,972
- Or before lunch.
- Or after lunch.

366
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,161
Either way. Before or after lunch.
Doesn't matter.

367
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:22,830
Why must it relate
to lunch at all?

368
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:26,313
It doesn't have to. We were just
using lunch as a measure of time.

369
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:27,971
A way to break up the day.

370
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,333
Yes, totally arbitrary.

371
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,521
I was thinking twilight
might be nice.

372
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:34,220
Great. Well, then 5:00 it is.

373
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:36,870
That's a wonderful... idea.

374
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:40,223
Sookie, what else
was on our list?

375
00:14:40,257 --> 00:14:41,561
Do you have yours with you?

376
00:14:41,595 --> 00:14:43,830
I don't. Sorry.

377
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:47,463
I left mine with yours, so...

378
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:48,993
The flowers.

379
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:51,382
Oh, that was the first
thing on our list.

380
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:52,960
There will definitely
be flowers.

381
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,970
I was thinking gerber
daisies would be nice,

382
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:58,693
maybe in red, yellows,
oranges to complement his fur.

383
00:14:58,728 --> 00:14:59,653
Done and done.

384
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:01,612
Can I trust you to
liaise with the florist?

385
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:03,541
I'll liaise with the florist.

386
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:05,621
Let's discuss the programs.

387
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:08,050
- The programs.
- You want programs?

388
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,893
Do you think when the Princess
of Wales was interred at Althorp

389
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:14,683
the Spencer family was asked
whether or not they wanted programs?

390
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:15,581
Probably not.

391
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:19,052
I assume there are no stationery
selections for me to choose from yet.

392
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,611
- Not yet.
- You know what, who cares?

393
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:22,273
Why don't we just
use fax paper?

394
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:24,232
And why not print them
out on the computer?

395
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:26,402
After all, it's just a dog.

396
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,880
Hey, Michel,
don't worry about the programs, okay?

397
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:32,653
We'll make up something
really nice for you.

398
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:33,943
Fine.

399
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:37,823
Here's the picture I'd
like to use for the cover.

400
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,571
Aw, well, isn't that cute?

401
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,911
Oh, yeah. Cute.

402
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,643
Shall we go over the menus?

403
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,301
Ah, the menus.
Well, Sookie, take it away.

404
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:49,153
Oh! Hey. Stay.

405
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:51,003
I'd love your input.

406
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:53,633
You've always let me know that when
it comes to food, you're the boss.

407
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:55,802
Well, you're the boss.

408
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:03,450
- Hi.
- Hi.

409
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,840
I guess we should talk.

410
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:08,201
I guess we should.

411
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:09,382
Crudit�s?

412
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:10,522
Not here. Come on.

413
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:13,312
If your child died,
would you serve crudit�s?

414
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,551
Hey, can my children
not be your go-to?!

415
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:22,511
Okay, go. Talk.

416
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,822
Well, obviously we
have some issues.

417
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:27,410
Issues? What issues?
We got in a fight and you took off.

418
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,200
- I was mad.
- Oh, you were mad.

419
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,471
Then never mind.
You should have left.

420
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:32,443
- Don't be sarcastic.
- Don't tell me what to do,

421
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:35,613
not when I wake up on the morning after
we have a fight and you've disappeared.

422
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:38,431
- I needed some space.
- Oh, you needed space?

423
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,192
We're married. You need space,
you walk around the block,

424
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:42,871
you go get a beer.
You don't take off.

425
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,500
My father was in the hospital.
You weren't there.

426
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,631
I turned my phone off after the fight.
I was upset.

427
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:47,923
I came as soon as I heard.

428
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:51,001
Yeah, you came and then you stayed
for an hour and then you left again.

429
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:53,521
I didn't feel like staying much
when I saw who else was there.

430
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:54,903
I didn't ask Luke to come.

431
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:56,413
You didn't ask him
to leave, either.

432
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,203
No, I didn't. He's my friend.

433
00:16:58,236 --> 00:16:59,542
He brought food.
You weren't there!

434
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:01,812
I was there. I saw your dad.
I checked in.

435
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:04,102
"Checked in." I'm not
the 6:40 to Buffalo.

436
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:06,211
I'm sorry.
I'm sick of seeing that guy.

437
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:07,590
How do you think I feel?

438
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:10,080
For two days,
I'm in that hospital 18 hours a day.

439
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,623
I didn't even know if
you were coming back.

440
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,800
- I needed time.
- I needed you.

441
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:14,791
Lor...

442
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,590
You know what the
worst part of it was?

443
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:20,172
When you weren't there,
part of me wasn't surprised.

444
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:23,220
That's not fair.

445
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,902
I can't do this now.
I have a million things to get done.

446
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:28,181
I just -- I can't.

447
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:30,473
- So, when?
- I don't know. Later.

448
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,983
Okay. Well, then,
you're all set for the 16th.

449
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,750
- Hang on.
- Hanging.

450
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:45,381
Yes, sir.

451
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:48,442
Well, that's wonderful.
We're looking forward to it. Thank you.

452
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:49,752
Okay, bye.

453
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:50,761
Hi, hon.

454
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:52,872
Quick, get me into a
microeconomic mood.

455
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:57,282
Uh, okay. Supply and demand,
profit margin, pork bellies.

456
00:17:57,316 --> 00:17:58,681
You had me till pork bellies.

457
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:00,683
You're going to grandpa's
class sans grandpa?

458
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:02,412
Yes, and I'm kind
of dreading it.

459
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:05,022
I only signed up for this class
because grandpa was teaching it.

460
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:06,782
I'm not naturally econ crazy.

461
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:08,861
Is anyone really econ crazy?

462
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:10,733
Oh, yeah.
First thing I learned last semester.

463
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:13,611
People find the gross national
product endlessly fascinating.

464
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,751
Weird.

465
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:15,881
Blew my mind.

466
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,360
So, how's your
re-immersion going?

467
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,570
Pretty good,
loving the non-fluorescent lighting,

468
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:23,173
although I miss eating my
meals out of a vending machine.

469
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:24,022
How are you doing?

470
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:24,960
Not bad.

471
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:27,851
Logan got me a marble plaque,
and Paris hid books. It was sweet.

472
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:29,510
All right,
must be a generational thing.

473
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:32,072
Must be. Any word from dad?
Latte, please.

474
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:36,110
Um... yes, actually.
He just came by the Inn.

475
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:37,701
- He did?
- A couple hours ago.

476
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,531
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know,

477
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,961
he said he's been
needing some space.

478
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,522
That's ridiculous.
He hasn't been home in two days.

479
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,753
He was upset about the letter, then he
saw Luke at the hospital, you know?

480
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:49,570
So what if he saw
Luke at the hospital?

481
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:50,890
He should have been
there for you.

482
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:52,350
He was. He came.

483
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:53,942
Yeah, but then he left.

484
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:56,412
Honey, look,
don't be mad at your dad, okay?

485
00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:58,320
It's a complicated situation.

486
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:00,072
Mom, stop it.
I'm not Switzerland.

487
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:01,942
- What?
- I'm on your side.

488
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:04,492
I don't want you to take sides.

489
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,213
Look, I'm not a
kid anymore, okay?

490
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:08,501
I get to have an opinion,
and I get to pick a side.

491
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:09,941
And I'm on your side,
like it or not.

492
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:10,802
Okay.

493
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:13,362
It's not just because you're
right and he's wrong.

494
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:15,893
I'm on your side,
no matter what.

495
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:17,690
No matter what?

496
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:21,780
I mean, even if I cut off all your
hair while you were sleeping,

497
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:23,361
would you still be
on my side then?

498
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:24,140
Yep.

499
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:27,012
What if I signed you up for a
camping trip and made you go?

500
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:27,840
Even then.

501
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,812
What if I put a secret clause on
your birth certificate that says

502
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:32,470
when you turn 23,
your name changes to Hildegarde?

503
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,671
There's no such thing as a
birth-certificate clause.

504
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,972
- I had a really good lawyer.
- Even then.

505
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:38,282
Oh, good to know.

506
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:40,722
So, talk to me.
How are you feeling?

507
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:43,640
Oh, good. Fine. Medium.

508
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:46,011
You know, rare --
medium rare. Rare.

509
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:47,243
More like sashimi.

510
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:48,193
Yeah?

511
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,952
It's scary, you know?
Your dad, um...

512
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:52,730
tends to...

513
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:56,193
avoid conflict when
things get complicated.

514
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:58,312
Did you tell him that?
You should tell him that.

515
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,170
I did.

516
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,472
I mean, I tried.

517
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:02,981
I was mad.
I told him we'd talk later.

518
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:04,732
Well, you can call me
after you talk to him.

519
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,973
I'm sure you guys will work
everything out, but...

520
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,553
you can call me if
you need anything.

521
00:20:08,588 --> 00:20:10,202
Yeah. I got you on speed dial.

522
00:20:10,237 --> 00:20:11,711
Really? You programmed
your speed dial?

523
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,011
No. It's
metaphorically speaking.

524
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,560
I can dial really fast, though.

525
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:17,420
Got you.
Okay, I'm gonna run into class.

526
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:18,721
Okay, hon. Sounds good.

527
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:20,890
- Okay, peace out, yo.
- Bye, Hilde.

528
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:25,693
- Hey, Rory.
- Hey.

529
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,470
- Good to see you.
- Rory Gilmore?

530
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:30,240
Heard your name.
Just want to introduce myself.

531
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:32,220
Tucker Culbertson,
filling in for your grandfather

532
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:33,771
until he's well
enough to come back.

533
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,660
Well, hello,
professor Culbertson.

534
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,823
Thanks for the promotion.

535
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:40,912
I'm not a professor yet.
I'm just a T.A.

536
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,101
Oh. Uh, sorry --

537
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:47,051
not that you're a T.A.,
just that I called you --

538
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:49,870
- Um, I'm Rory.
- I know.

539
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:51,602
Right.

540
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,982
So, how's he doing?

541
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:54,870
Great. Thanks.

542
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,033
I'm glad.
I heard he's a terrific lecturer.

543
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:59,060
Oh, yeah, the best --

544
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:02,032
well, in my entirely
biased opinion.

545
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,601
I'm with you. I can't believe
this is his first year teaching.

546
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:07,522
He really put together a great syllabus.
I'm looking forward to getting into it.

547
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,763
Me too.

548
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:10,342
Well, it's nice to
meet you, Rory.

549
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,052
Yeah, well, good luck.

550
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:16,200
Oh, I mean,
not that you need it or anything.

551
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:18,013
Okay, bye.

552
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,521
- Hey.
- Hey.

553
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,220
Sorry I'm late.
It was busy at work.

554
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:32,412
That's okay.

555
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:34,941
I hope you don't mind.
I saw you were using three of them,

556
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:37,290
so I thought I'd program
your universal remote.

557
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:38,450
Thanks.

558
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:40,832
- Want some coffee?
- No, I'm okay...

559
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:43,632
- Unless you want some.
- No, I'm okay.

560
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,933
- So, uh...
- So, uh...

561
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:52,430
I've been thinking
about things, and...

562
00:21:52,468 --> 00:21:54,323
you're right.
I shouldn't have taken off.

563
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,360
No, you shouldn't have.

564
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:57,253
But you got to understand,
Lor, that letter --

565
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:59,221
- Ugh. "Character reference."
- Whatever.

566
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:00,761
No, not whatever.

567
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,181
There's a big difference between a
letter and a character reference.

568
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:05,282
I had to write that stuff
for Luke for a judge

569
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:06,993
so he could get
custody of his kid.

570
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:08,043
- Don't do that.
- What?

571
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,463
Make me think this
is all in my head.

572
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:10,462
- It is!
- It's not!

573
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,923
- I see the way you look at him.
- Stop.

574
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,801
I chose you. I married you.

575
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,852
- It's not that simple.
- What else is there?

576
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,843
- Stuff! There's other stuff.
- Like what?

577
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:20,923
I got into a fight
with the guy, Lor.

578
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:22,043
What?

579
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:25,152
About a month ago at the gazebo,
I just walked up to him.

580
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:27,220
We started whaling
on each other.

581
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:28,543
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

582
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:30,790
It's not something
I'm exactly proud of.

583
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:32,970
This is what it's come to --
I'm fighting the guy in the street.

584
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:35,572
Isn't that the kind of thing
you would tell a person?

585
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:38,730
I mean, I could help.
I could have been more sensitive.

586
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,490
It's not just about
the fight, Lor.

587
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,500
I should have given you more time.
You asked me to.

588
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,521
I said I would. I didn't.

589
00:22:44,555 --> 00:22:45,521
No, Chris.

590
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:47,942
You were vulnerable,
and I pushed you.

591
00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:50,440
And I think it's because we
always had this timing issue.

592
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:53,333
We were too young,
and then Sherry got pregnant.

593
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:55,073
You were with him and --

594
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,051
I don't know.
I saw this opportunity, and I thought,

595
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:59,391
"now, we should do this now
while we have the chance,

596
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,742
while you're free and clear."
But you weren't. You're not.

597
00:23:01,765 --> 00:23:02,811
Yes, I am!

598
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:06,520
You were engaged to him, Lor.
You needed time to -- to disengage.

599
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:08,391
Stop. That's not what this is.

600
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:10,922
We're together now.
Maybe we did rush into it,

601
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,340
but we can work this out.

602
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:16,702
I don't think we can.

603
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:19,613
What does that mean?

604
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,942
You're giving up?

605
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:22,751
I don't know what else to do.

606
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:25,210
There's lots else to do.
We can work on this.

607
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:27,080
Work on what?
Work on you thinking that I'm the man

608
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,622
you want to spend the
rest of your life with?

609
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,891
I've been asking you to marry me
for 20 years. We're finally married.

610
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:32,893
I still feel like
I'm asking you.

611
00:23:33,308 --> 00:23:34,602
That's terrible.

612
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:37,333
I'm sorry if you feel that way,

613
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:39,133
if I made you feel that way.

614
00:23:39,658 --> 00:23:42,323
That's not how I feel.
I'm in this.

615
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:44,620
I want to believe that.

616
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:46,750
You should. It's true.

617
00:23:51,978 --> 00:23:54,683
Look, I should probably
get back to my mom's.

618
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,601
G.G.'s been there all day.

619
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:59,480
Yeah, you should be with her.
How is she?

620
00:24:00,537 --> 00:24:03,080
She's fine. She's good.

621
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:07,352
So, we'll talk more tomorrow?

622
00:24:08,337 --> 00:24:10,130
Okay. Yeah.

623
00:24:21,497 --> 00:24:23,771
Lorelai, I specifically
sent out a memo

624
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,071
asking that all
pillows featuring cats

625
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:27,760
- be removed from the library.
- What?

626
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:28,991
The cat pillows --
they're still there!

627
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:30,800
Ah, yeah, I'll take care of it,
I promise.

628
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:32,582
- And you have to talk to Sookie.
- What about?

629
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:34,230
I asked her about
the final menu.

630
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,423
She said she didn't have it yet.
I said "when can I expect it?"

631
00:24:36,456 --> 00:24:39,200
She said she wasn't sure. I said,
"might I ask what you are planning?"

632
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:40,803
And she said -- and I quote --

633
00:24:40,837 --> 00:24:43,190
"let's see what's left over
at the end of the day,

634
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:45,231
and I'll whip up
something delicious."

635
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,652
Leftovers! Why even bother?

636
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:51,090
Is it too much to ask that
the passing of my beloved dog

637
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,463
be marked by food that has
been prepared specifically

638
00:24:53,495 --> 00:24:54,800
with that occasion in mind?

639
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:56,683
I'm sure the food
will be wonderful.

640
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,420
Have you called
about the flowers?

641
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,351
- I was just about to.
- Lorelai.

642
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:02,022
Grayson's only needs
a 2-hour heads up.

643
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:04,430
At least do you have a
program for me to approve?

644
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:05,823
Uh, not yet, but I will.

645
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:08,713
- The funeral is tonight.
- I'm well aware of that.

646
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:11,012
- Then why has nothing been done?
- Plenty has been done.

647
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:13,762
No! Nothing has been done.
You are putting no effort into --

648
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:15,100
Michel, back off.

649
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:17,091
I happen to have a few other
things on my mind right now,

650
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,060
so forgive me if I haven't
put all of my energy

651
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:21,290
into focusing on
your dog funeral.

652
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:27,130
I apologize that my loss has come
at an inopportune time for you.

653
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,351
I will try to schedule
the next death

654
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:31,441
when it is more convenient.

655
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:37,910
Let's see -- "Gender trouble,"
Judith Butler. It should be here.

656
00:25:37,947 --> 00:25:39,022
Are you sure this is
where you hid it?

657
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:41,052
Of course.
I had an aunt Judy who loved to travel,

658
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:42,223
hence the travel section.

659
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:44,633
Then I used my standard
covert alphabetizing system

660
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:46,822
using the third letter of
the author's last name, "T,"

661
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,210
followed by the third letter of
the author's first name, "D."

662
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,430
So it should be right here,
after Tabin but before Thoreau.

663
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:53,882
I don't understand
why it's not here.

664
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:56,092
Okay, I'm gonna go check the
women's studies section again,

665
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:58,243
see if I can find a used copy,
just in case.

666
00:25:58,275 --> 00:26:00,402
Wait a minute.
This whole shelf is a mess.

667
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,891
Why is Congwen Shen
before Tony Griffiths?

668
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,490
Excuse me. You.

669
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:06,440
Come over here and
explain yourself.

670
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:12,913
Rory.

671
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:14,831
Oh. Hey.

672
00:26:14,997 --> 00:26:16,723
- How you doing?
- Good, thanks.

673
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:19,240
I'm glad.
I wanted to thank you.

674
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:21,163
Seems you gave me a
pretty good evaluation.

675
00:26:21,195 --> 00:26:21,851
What?

676
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:23,352
I got a call from
your grandfather.

677
00:26:23,388 --> 00:26:24,660
I think he was
talking about class,

678
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:27,520
unless you happened to see the econ
grad students take out the comp.

679
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:29,091
Lit grad students in
ultimate frisbee.

680
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,993
Oh, right. I'm sorry.
I'm a little all over the place.

681
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:33,470
New semester, you know.

682
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:36,142
I just wanted to thank you.
It's always nice to get good feedback.

683
00:26:36,156 --> 00:26:37,770
- No problem.
- See you around.

684
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:38,891
Okay.

685
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:42,080
That -- That's a good book.

686
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,993
- Which one?
- Um, "Eva luna."

687
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:47,450
Everyone loves "House of the
spirits," but I just think "Eva luna"

688
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:48,872
is Allende's best work.

689
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,663
Cool. I'm looking
forward to reading it.

690
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:51,953
Yeah, me too.

691
00:26:52,626 --> 00:26:54,350
Oh, for you to read it.

692
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:56,373
I'll see you around.

693
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,553
Bye, Rory.

694
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:00,832
Where were you? The women's
studies section is over there.

695
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:02,950
Um, yeah, I was on my way.

696
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:04,141
The book's gone.

697
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:06,682
Apparently, they redid the travel
section and alphabetized it

698
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:08,623
according to destination
instead of author.

699
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:10,812
I ripped the salesman a new one,
but it was too late.

700
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:13,291
Hey. What's wrong with you?

701
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:13,993
What?

702
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:15,202
You're all red and blotchy.

703
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:16,353
Oh, am I?

704
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:18,893
It's probably just 'cause
I'm a bit warm in here.

705
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:20,423
So you found it?

706
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:22,492
No. Weren't you listening?

707
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:25,900
Here. It's used, but luckily,
the previous owner was a dimwit slacker

708
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,302
who only made it
through chapter one.

709
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:28,583
Oh, great.

710
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:30,680
That's good.

711
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,350
Flower delivery.

712
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:34,782
Kirk?

713
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:36,780
Oh, I didn't know you
worked for Grayson's.

714
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:39,093
Oh, no, I don't work there.
I'm volunteering.

715
00:27:39,128 --> 00:27:40,282
How... noble.

716
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:42,991
Yeah, I just thought it was
time to give something back.

717
00:27:43,026 --> 00:27:44,210
Here's your bill.

718
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:47,030
It's a little high because we
had to do a little airbrushing.

719
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,721
Small blemish on the nose.

720
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:52,232
Probably wasn't visible to the naked
eye, but when we blew the picture up --

721
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:53,613
- Wow.
- Sounds great.

722
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:56,091
I got stuff to take care of.
Bring the rest of the flowers in?

723
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,433
Sure thing.

724
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:00,493
I don't want to
embarrass you, but

725
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:02,741
it is customary to
tip the deliveryman.

726
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:03,972
I thought you
were volunteering.

727
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:05,222
Not for you.

728
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:07,660
Ask Rob at the front desk.
He's got the petty cash.

729
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,001
Hey, Christy,
will we see you tonight at the memorial?

730
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,830
- Actually, I don't think --
- Let me rephrase that.

731
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:15,700
We'll see you tonight at the memorial.
Attendance is mandatory. Thanks.

732
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:19,301
- How's the food coming?
- Hey!

733
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:21,720
I've got a walnut arugula
gorgonzola croustini,

734
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:24,553
a little caraway cornbread
with apricots, bacon,

735
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:26,481
and a little jalape�o jam,

736
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:29,182
beef tenderloin chiffonade
in little focaccia rounds,

737
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:31,183
and -- oh! --
sweet potato biscuits

738
00:28:31,216 --> 00:28:33,740
with pork tenderloin and
a little apple chutney.

739
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:34,763
- Wow.
- Yeah.

740
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,552
Some of my finest work all
wasted on a dog funeral

741
00:28:37,587 --> 00:28:38,960
and a petty little man.

742
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:40,822
Well, he said some
things he didn't mean.

743
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,472
You don't go after
someone's children.

744
00:28:42,507 --> 00:28:46,091
He's going through a very rough time,
and he really will appreciate all
of this.

745
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,650
I know. I made him
some fat-free brownies, too.

746
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,270
I know. I'm a softy.

747
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:51,961
And the whole kitchen staff's
gonna be there, right?

748
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:53,650
Those who value
their jobs will be.

749
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:55,302
I pulled out my "don't
mess with me" face,

750
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:57,123
which I use on the
kids all the time.

751
00:28:57,157 --> 00:28:59,620
I'll be damned if they don't
hop to and brush those teeth.

752
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,903
Good, I want a full house,
and if they have minty-fresh breath,

753
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:03,120
that's just a plus.

754
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,502
They'll be there --
not that Michel will say thank you

755
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,803
or modify his behavior in any
way to show that he's grateful,

756
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:11,811
but just so you know,
you're doing a really nice thing.

757
00:29:11,848 --> 00:29:14,311
Well, thanks.
I feel bad about snapping at him.

758
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:16,592
You have a lot on your mind.
Want a brownie?

759
00:29:16,627 --> 00:29:17,952
Mm, no, thanks.

760
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:20,261
Um, so,
I talked to Christopher.

761
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:21,743
Wait. Get out.

762
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:23,591
You're doing a
great job, though!

763
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:24,933
- Thanks. Sorry.
- Keep it up.

764
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:26,520
Go.

765
00:29:27,077 --> 00:29:29,012
I talked to Christopher.
I was really mad.

766
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:30,492
But you were able
to work it out.

767
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:33,041
We're working on working it out.
He thinks I don't want to be in it.

768
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:35,523
He thinks that I don't even
want to be in this marriage.

769
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:37,672
- But you do, right?
- Of course I do.

770
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:38,633
Yeah, that's what I thought.

771
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:40,231
It's this Luke thing.

772
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:42,883
Christopher's jealousy
is blinding him,

773
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:46,273
and I've been racking my brain to
think of a way to convince him

774
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:48,052
that I twant to be
in this marriage.

775
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:51,523
And I think the only way is if I
cut Luke out of my life entirely.

776
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:52,462
No Luke at all.

777
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:54,560
No, I mean,
it wouldn't be that big a difference.

778
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:57,492
It's not like I see
him a lot as it is.

779
00:29:57,526 --> 00:30:00,663
Well, that's true, although just
because you don't see him a lot

780
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:03,222
doesn't mean he's not a
big part of your life.

781
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:05,241
Eight months ago,
you were engaged to the guy.

782
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:08,110
I know. I try not to dwell on
that because I've moved on.

783
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:09,800
I-I married Christopher.

784
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:12,903
It's just that it's Luke.
You guys were together a long time.

785
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:13,773
I know.

786
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:16,640
You were friends for years
even before you were together.

787
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:19,222
And then, when you were together,
you were really together.

788
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:20,711
Yes. We were.

789
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:23,252
So all I'm saying is that
you broke up with Luke

790
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,091
and immediately started
dating Christopher.

791
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,090
And I know you're over it,
and I know you've moved on,

792
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:31,071
but all those feelings for Luke didn't
just disappear overnight, right?

793
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:32,990
That's what I'm saying.
Of course they didn't.

794
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:34,921
It's just,
you moved really quickly.

795
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:38,301
Yes, I moved quickly to a
man I love who loves me,

796
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,031
who wanted to marry me.

797
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:42,552
When Luke and I were together,
he was kind

798
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:44,603
and loyal and thoughtful.

799
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:46,720
The guy built me an ice-skating rink,
for god's sake.

800
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,031
God, I forgot about that.

801
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,440
But he was also distant
and uncommunicative,

802
00:30:50,476 --> 00:30:52,340
and he didn't want to marry me.

803
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:54,650
And I tried everything
I could to work it out.

804
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,092
Of course I have
feelings for him.

805
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:57,640
That's what Christopher's
responding to,

806
00:30:57,677 --> 00:30:59,943
and that's why,
in order to save my marriage,

807
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:02,770
the only thing I can do
is cut Luke out, right?

808
00:31:02,806 --> 00:31:03,970
Right.

809
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:08,401
I'm sorry, it's just,
I have a but.

810
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:09,622
Yes?

811
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:15,122
If there were no Luke -- no Luke in
the past, no Luke in the picture...

812
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:17,341
Yeah?

813
00:31:17,737 --> 00:31:19,702
Well, would it be Christopher?

814
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:21,932
Would he be "the one"?

815
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,380
I don't even know why we are
bothering to select music.

816
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,611
Why not just turn on the
radio and hope for the best?

817
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:34,861
Maybe we'll get lucky
and a hip-hop station

818
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:36,763
will be playing
Snoop Doggy Dogg.

819
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:38,712
Michel, come on.
I said I'm sorry.

820
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,192
We're gonna have a
beautiful ceremony.

821
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:41,651
Look, here's Zach. Hi, Zach.

822
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:43,201
Hey. Lorelai.

823
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:46,660
Hello, Michel.
I'm very sorry to hear about your loss.

824
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:47,910
It totally blows.

825
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,101
Thank you.

826
00:31:49,137 --> 00:31:51,273
So, Zach's gonna do the
music for the ceremony.

827
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:53,740
I'm psyched, dude.
At first I was thinking mandolin,

828
00:31:53,776 --> 00:31:55,731
but then I'm like, "whoa,
Zach, are you tripping?

829
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:57,471
It's got to be the
acoustic guitar."

830
00:31:57,508 --> 00:31:58,950
A way more soulful sound.

831
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:00,873
Have you thought about the
music for the ceremony?

832
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:03,060
Yeah, I did --
vintage Bowie, originally recorded

833
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:06,070
with Herbie Flowers on bass,
Aynsley Dunbar on drums.

834
00:32:06,105 --> 00:32:07,612
You know where I'm going?

835
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:10,171
"Diamond dogs"? Whoo-Hoo-Hoo!

836
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:12,092
# They call them
the diamond dogs #

837
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:14,013
# Bow-wow, woof woof,
whoo-hoo! #

838
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:15,373
That sounds great.

839
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:17,651
We didn't need a song
that necessarily had dogs

840
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,923
in the lyrics, right, Michel?

841
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:22,650
Whatever. David Bowie
sounds like a hoot.

842
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:24,863
More princess Diana, less dog.

843
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:26,320
So you want Elton John?

844
00:32:26,356 --> 00:32:29,131
We were thinking very dignified --
Bach, Mozart.

845
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,930
- C�line Dion.
- Or C�line Dion.

846
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:32,380
Please don't make me do that.

847
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:35,721
After all, "My heart will go on"
was Chin Chin's favorite song.

848
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:37,982
Oh, well, then,
there you go, huh?

849
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:41,781
We'll just find, uh,
"My heart." "My heart belongs to daddy,"

850
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:43,811
"My heart belongs to me,"
"My heart belongs to you."

851
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:45,151
My heart can't
make up its mind.

852
00:32:45,188 --> 00:32:47,400
How about "Tears in heaven"?
That's a wicked song.

853
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:49,883
Well, "My heart is
crying for you,"

854
00:32:49,915 --> 00:32:51,873
"My heart is waiting,"
"My heart stood still."

855
00:32:51,908 --> 00:32:54,113
People very interested in
this whole heart thing.

856
00:32:54,145 --> 00:32:56,360
"I will always love you" --
it's got the cheese factor,

857
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:58,561
but it's still at
least a legitimate --

858
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:02,260
- "My heart will go on."
- Oh, good! They have it!

859
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:06,052
So you get working on that,
and, uh, we'll be moving on.

860
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:10,722
Okay, so,
we're all set with the music,

861
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,960
and the rest of the flowers should
be delivered in about an hour.

862
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:15,153
You got your suit from the cleaners.
All we have to do now

863
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:18,393
is stop by the printer's and
approve the layout for the program.

864
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:21,692
Actually, as long as we're here,
I think I'm gonna stop into Luke's.

865
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:23,031
Really? Why?

866
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:26,213
Do you remember last year when that
troupe of mimes took over the Inn?

867
00:33:26,248 --> 00:33:30,201
It was a very stressful time for me,
guessing at what they wanted,

868
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:33,363
watching to see what they were pointing
at so I knew what to fetch them.

869
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:36,533
When they finally left,
I needed a bit of comfort,

870
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:40,692
so I stopped at Luke's
and I bought a hamburger.

871
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:41,782
- You didn't.
- I know.

872
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:43,552
It was a moment of insanity.

873
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:45,452
Thank god by the
time I got home,

874
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:48,311
I had already calculated that
it would take me 55 minutes

875
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:52,340
of medium-intensity interval training on
my elliptical machine to work it off.

876
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:55,571
Thought better of the whole thing and
dumped the foul thing in the trash.

877
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:56,592
Close call.

878
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:58,893
Yeah, extremely.
Unfortunately, Chin Chin,

879
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:03,063
being the little rascal that he was,
fished it out of the garbage.

880
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:06,860
After all the exotic dog
food I lavished on him --

881
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:09,502
homemade biscuits,
fresh-ground lamb --

882
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:13,560
It was this burger that he
seemed to enjoy the most.

883
00:34:13,598 --> 00:34:17,842
And today,
I will eat one in his memory.

884
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:19,901
Well, what a sacrifice.

885
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:21,663
Uh, go on in.
You get your burger.

886
00:34:21,697 --> 00:34:23,103
I'll get started
at the printer's.

887
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:24,381
Sounds good.

888
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:26,780
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

889
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:49,990
What are you doing here?!

890
00:34:50,025 --> 00:34:52,112
Aw, I couldn't
wait till sunday.

891
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:55,661
What's that look?

892
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:58,691
Oh, Paris calls it my
Harlequin romance face.

893
00:34:58,727 --> 00:34:59,862
Come on in!

894
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:04,921
Where is the infamous
miss Geller?

895
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:07,172
Now? Let's see.

896
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:11,032
This afternoon, she is belly dancing
with the Yale Belly Dance Society

897
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:12,332
at the Payne Whitney gym.

898
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:13,852
Wow, how'd you get out of it?

899
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:17,161
I'm supposed to be at a wrestling match.
We're supposed to trade notes later.

900
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:18,402
Use the term "half nelson."

901
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:20,253
I'll use the term "whole
nelson." I'm not afraid.

902
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,461
Yeah, don't do that.

903
00:35:25,078 --> 00:35:27,373
Logan, um,
I have to talk to you.

904
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:28,611
Sure, what's going on?

905
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:31,492
Well, uh, maybe let's sit.

906
00:35:31,528 --> 00:35:33,240
Yeah, come on. Sit down.

907
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:34,593
Okay.

908
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:39,853
Okay. Um...

909
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:42,982
This is hard for
me to bring up,

910
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:47,770
but, um, because of the whole
thing that happened with Marty,

911
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:49,282
I just wanted to tell
you about it now

912
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:51,500
so that you don't think
this is a big deal.

913
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:53,503
Or, actually, maybe it is a big deal.
I don't know.

914
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:55,000
That's why I want to
talk to you about it.

915
00:35:55,038 --> 00:35:56,190
What's going on?

916
00:35:56,225 --> 00:36:01,613
Well, maybe it's just human nature.
Maybe we don't want to be happy.

917
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:02,783
You're not happy?

918
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:05,603
No, that's not what I'm saying.
I'm so happy.

919
00:36:05,637 --> 00:36:07,662
Okay, good,
so what's the problem?

920
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:12,563
Um, I don't know. I never thought of
myself as a self-destructive person before,

921
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:17,103
but I don't know, maybe I do have
this weird self-sabotaging streak.

922
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:18,723
What are you talking about?

923
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:22,943
Well, the grad student who's
filling in for my grandfather --

924
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:25,713
I guess he's kind
of good-looking.

925
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:29,363
And I ran into him at the bookstore,
and I told him I liked Isabel Allende,

926
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:31,313
and it was disgusting!

927
00:36:31,346 --> 00:36:33,731
You told him you
like Isabel Allende?

928
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:37,231
But it was the way I said it.
I was all nervous and weird.

929
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:40,450
I googled him after class.
I don't know even know why.

930
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:43,810
You're being so perfect,
and I'm turning into this monster.

931
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:46,431
- You're not a monster.
- No, I am. I am.

932
00:36:46,468 --> 00:36:51,032
I think I got so safe
and felt so good with you

933
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:53,562
that I let my guard down,
and this beast emerged.

934
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:55,522
Hey, make up your mind.
Are you a beast or a monster?

935
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:56,542
- Logan.
- What?

936
00:36:56,577 --> 00:36:58,540
It sounds like you have
a crush on this guy.

937
00:36:58,577 --> 00:37:00,241
I'm so sorry.

938
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:02,240
Why are you looking
at me like that?

939
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:03,773
It's just a crush.

940
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:05,001
You're not upset?

941
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:08,411
I'd be a hypocrite, because I have on
occasion found other girls attractive.

942
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:09,402
Yes, I know.

943
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,441
But I would never do anything
about it because I love you

944
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:12,992
and want to be with you.

945
00:37:13,206 --> 00:37:14,481
That's good, I guess.

946
00:37:14,515 --> 00:37:16,662
- You guess.
- No, it is good.

947
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:19,201
It's just, did I break you?

948
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,372
What?

949
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:23,972
Paris said that I broke you,
that if I kicked you with my spurs,

950
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,440
you wouldn't spook.
Is that true?

951
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,311
No, I'd definitely
be a little spooked.

952
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,173
- You know what I mean.
- I honestly don't.

953
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:33,673
I guess she meant that you
belong to me or something.

954
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:35,572
Well, do you belong to me?

955
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:37,262
Yeah, I guess I do.

956
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,232
Well, then I'm cool with that.

957
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:40,771
- You are?
- Yeah.

958
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:42,660
This whole thing is my fault.

959
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,822
- What? Why?
- I was a jerk about Marty.

960
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:47,062
I overreacted,
and I obviously freaked you out so much

961
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,193
I made you think you have to tell me
when you recommend a book to a guy,

962
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:50,673
and you don't, okay?

963
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,172
Yeah, okay.

964
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:55,122
Because I trust you completely,
and I'm not worried about us.

965
00:37:55,157 --> 00:37:57,022
Yeah, I guess I'm not either.

966
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:58,731
It's weird.

967
00:37:58,795 --> 00:38:00,200
But good weird?

968
00:38:00,475 --> 00:38:01,833
Great weird.

969
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,492
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah. Anything.

970
00:38:09,685 --> 00:38:11,730
Has Paris ever
belly danced before?

971
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:13,352
No, I think this is
her first class.

972
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:15,300
- Another question?
- Shoot.

973
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,540
Why the hell aren't we
over there watching her?

974
00:38:17,746 --> 00:38:19,083
Yeah, we should.

975
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:21,520
- Hi.
- Hey.

976
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,450
How was the funeral?

977
00:39:25,828 --> 00:39:26,911
Sad.

978
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:41,090
- It's not just Luke.
- Lor...

979
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:45,322
I mean, you were right.

980
00:39:45,947 --> 00:39:47,732
There are feelings there,

981
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:49,583
because...

982
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:54,332
When that ended, I just jumped.

983
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:56,533
I pushed you.

984
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:58,961
I jumped.

985
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:04,732
But if that's all there was --

986
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:07,910
If that's all it was,

987
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:10,570
we could fix it, you know...

988
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:12,893
with time.

989
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:15,050
But it's not.

990
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:23,130
You've always been this...
possibility for me...

991
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:28,251
...this wonderful possibility.

992
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:31,373
But it's just not right.

993
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:36,293
And I'm so sorry.

994
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,793
I'm so sorry.

995
00:40:44,498 --> 00:40:45,540
Yeah.

996
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:52,641
I guess I should
have known, huh?

997
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:55,411
It took me 20 years to
get you to say yes.

998
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:58,780
I need you to know...

999
00:40:59,677 --> 00:41:02,301
that you're the man...

1000
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:04,691
I want to want.

1001
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:07,571
I know.

1002
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:13,842
You have no idea...
how badly I wish...

1003
00:41:13,877 --> 00:41:14,911
I do.

1004
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,210
I do know.

1005
00:41:31,046 --> 00:41:32,103
I do.

1006
