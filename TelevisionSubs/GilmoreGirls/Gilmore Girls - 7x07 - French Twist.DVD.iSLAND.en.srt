1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:02,585
Okay, sweetie, what do we say to
mommy when we see her at the airport?

2
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:03,474
Bonjour!

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,203
"Bonjour, mama!
What's the haps?"

4
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:07,100
I don't know the french
word for "haps." Passports?

5
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,132
Got 'em. But sweetie,
even after we meet up with mommy,

6
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:10,860
we're gonna stay with
you all day, okay?

7
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,711
All day. You will not
be able to shake us. Cash?

8
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:13,448
Check.

9
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:15,138
- Confusing shorthand.
- Check -- I've got cash.

10
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:15,741
Thank you.

11
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:17,286
Will there be food
on the plane?

12
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:18,774
There will be food,

13
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,439
but airplane food is one
of life's cruel jokes,

14
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:24,055
so, just in case,
we have snacks up the wazoo.

15
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:26,769
Are you sure the departure's 3:30?
Why did I think it was later?

16
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:28,055
3:30-ish.

17
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:30,098
That's what it says on the ticket?
"Departure 3:30-ish"?

18
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,371
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Traffic this time of day's impossible.

19
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,675
All right, honey. Let's go.

20
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,744
You choose a trip to France
to start using free weights?

21
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:38,662
Those are my shoes--
of course it's heavy.

22
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:39,908
You teach them and teach them,

23
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:42,354
but they never learn,
do they, G.G.?

24
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:45,780
Why do I feel like the
departure was 6:15?

25
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:46,958
Let's go.

26
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:49,461
Now, G.G.,
you are gonna love Paris.

27
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:51,292
You know,
they call it "the city of love."

28
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:52,972
- Why?
- Why?

29
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:54,677
Well, because it's romantic,

30
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:57,365
and there's just
love everywhere.

31
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,801
Of course,
there's also pigeons everywhere,

32
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:02,533
but nobody would want to visit
the city of pigeons, would they?

33
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:03,645
I think we're ready.

34
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:06,840
Are you gonna tell me what time
this flight actually leaves?

35
00:01:06,854 --> 00:01:08,039
Soon.

36
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:11,249
Your daddy is very vague, G.G.

37
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:12,937
How cool is it that
we're going to France?

38
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:14,897
You're going to have such a
good time staying in Paris.

39
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:16,937
I am green with envy.
Am I green?

40
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:19,000
- It's more of a teal.
- It goes great with my eyes.

41
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:21,312
Driver, take us to France!
Au revoir, house!

42
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:22,721
Au revoir, house!

43
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,756
We're pretty low on gas.
Gonna have to stop and get some.

44
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:26,231
Honey, how do we have time
to stop for gas?

45
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:28,197
Our flight's not
for 3 1/2 hours.

46
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,890
We knew it, G.G., didn't we?

47
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,682
G.G. and I knew it.

48
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,390
So, as your newly
elected editor in chief,

49
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:33,606
it is my great honor to...

50
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,609
- honor... the stepping down...
- Okay.

51
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:38,181
- "Stepping down."
- Eloquent.

52
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:39,448
...of our former leader.

53
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,136
Anyone else thinking "recall"?

54
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:43,521
That's okay, Bill. Keep going.

55
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,574
As I was saying, in recognition

56
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:48,250
of  Rory's hard work and
devotion to the Daily News,

57
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:50,304
we have a few tokens
of our appreciation.

58
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:51,090
A.K.?

59
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:52,951
This is just something
to hang on your wall

60
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,060
when you become editor
of the New York Times.

61
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:56,088
Oh, thank you.

62
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,185
It's the front page of the
last edition you edited.

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,941
Yeah, she needed
that explained.

64
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:03,709
Rory... this is to commemorate
all those articles of ours

65
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:05,755
that you
carefully, thoughtfully

66
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,278
ripped to shreds.

67
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,397
Thank you, Rob.
Now I think I have to go out

68
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:11,748
and buy a freakishly
large pencil sharpener.

69
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,501
I have a confession to make.

70
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:17,588
I only joined the Yale Daily
News as a way to meet cute guys,

71
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:20,878
but after watching you handle the
job of editor with intelligence

72
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:22,844
and... and grace...

73
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:25,463
I became inspired to
become a journalist.

74
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:26,766
Thank you.

75
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:30,756
Whoa, Joni,
I'm touched and a little damp.

76
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:32,309
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

77
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:33,880
I have a Rory story.

78
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:36,355
When I was running the paper,
I was dying to do an article

79
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:39,177
about everybody's asinine
obsession with Boho Chic,

80
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:40,872
but Rory had the
guts to tell me

81
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,271
that the idea for my
article was trite and passé,

82
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:44,679
because that's who Rory is --

83
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:47,068
honest, direct,
and to the point.

84
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:48,784
Like, when you all turned on me

85
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:50,905
and decided you didn't
want me in charge anymore,

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,101
and you all chewed me
up and spit me out,

87
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:55,528
Rory was the one who
broke the news to me.

88
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,869
Thank you, Rory,

89
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,529
for being the one
person with integrity

90
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:01,406
among a collection
of cowardly back servers.

91
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:07,715
These are all such
great stories.

92
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:09,989
- To Rory.
- To Rory!

93
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:11,658
Thank you very much.

94
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:13,530
I didn't write a
speech or anything,

95
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:15,848
although I could recite "The
Charge of the Light Brigade,"

96
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:18,016
or the lyrics to
"Rebel Rebel"...

97
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,091
Let's hear it.

98
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:22,015
...neither of which I think
are appropriate, but, um...

99
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:25,124
Look, I've really
enjoyed being editor.

100
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,455
It's been great.

101
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,515
But it's time for
a change, right?

102
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:34,503
So sayeth the Yale
Daily News bylaws.

103
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:36,959
Um, so...

104
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,117
ladies and gentlemen,

105
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,014
I give you your new
editor in chief --

106
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:43,423
what's your name again?

107
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:44,898
Ha ha.

108
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:46,838
Anyway, my first editorial move

109
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,791
is to take everyone
to Rich Man's Shoe.

110
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:49,836
Drinks on me.

111
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:51,862
All right,
that's what I'm talking about!

112
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:54,497
All right! All right!

113
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:56,502
Coming?

114
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:57,749
- Huh?
- For drinks?

115
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,803
Uh, no. I think I'm gonna pass.

116
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:00,830
How  come?

117
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,911
Um, well, new editor,
new regime --

118
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:05,059
I don't want it to seem like I'm
still trying to be your boss.

119
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:07,809
Yeah, no one likes someone hanging
around, telling us how to get drunk.

120
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:08,771
You know what I mean.

121
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:09,806
Yeah.

122
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:11,513
- See you around.
- You too.

123
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,784
Well, now we're both
ousted leaders.

124
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:15,644
Welcome to club Nixon.

125
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:25,901
Twins, Zach.
We're having twins.

126
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:27,812
Yeah, it's heavy,
but we can handle it.

127
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:30,209
Twice as many mouths to feed,
twice as much to clean up after...

128
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,209
Yeah, all that --
plus, there's gonna be prejudice,

129
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:33,898
- but we can fight that.
- What?

130
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,076
And they have
surgeries now, babe.

131
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,678
- This does not have to be permanent.
- What doesn't?

132
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,459
As long as the babies don't have some vital
organ attached, they can be separated--

133
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:40,924
- easy-breezy.
- What are you talking about?

134
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,562
Until the operation,
we'll just get specially made clothes.

135
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,980
Unless they're attached at the head.
Then they can wear just about anything.

136
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:47,611
I mean,
we just slip it on from the feet up --

137
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:50,671
Zach, we're having twins,
not siamese twins.

138
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:58,085
Dude, that is such
a load off my mind!

139
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,741
So than why were you freaking
out at the doctor's office?

140
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,149
Because we're having twins!

141
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:04,287
Yeah, but they're separate.
It's, like, way easier.

142
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:06,562
Easier than what?
Triplets? Siamese triplets?

143
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:09,908
Yeah, Zach, twins is way
easier than siamese triplets.

144
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:14,865
I think we kind of have to tell
your mother you're pregnant now.

145
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,360
Ugh... she is so
going to kill me!

146
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:19,890
- I mean, you're starting to show.
- Of course I'm starting to show!

147
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,802
My body's filling up
with two growing people!

148
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,449
She is so gonna think we
had sex before the wedding,

149
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,570
and she'll convince me we did.

150
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:26,816
But we didn't.
Believe me. I'd remember.

151
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,241
You don't understand.
This is what she does to me.

152
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,035
She gives me this look, and I get
all panicky and start sweating.

153
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,769
Once, at a church picnic,
someone had taken a bite

154
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:35,859
out of six deviled eggs and
put them back on the platter.

155
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:38,978
My mother accused me of doing it,
and I almost confessed!

156
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,222
- But you hate deviled eggs.
- That's the point!

157
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,023
After she gave me that look,
I wasn't sure.

158
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,445
Maybe I had taken those bites.

159
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:46,995
She gets in my head.
It's like korean voodoo.

160
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:50,264
It's gonna be okay. It is.

161
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,988
Whoa... you know what
this picture is?

162
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:54,627
Our first album cover.

163
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:55,682
Zach...

164
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:58,109
Yeah, it's like a
prenatal "Nevermind."

165
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:14,335
Merci...

166
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,443
monsieur... bellhop. Jeesh.

167
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:20,800
Did you see that? He literally
sniffed at my tip and sauntered off.

168
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:23,370
Yeah, he sniffed and sauntered.
He did not hop.

169
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:25,709
The bellhop was a gem
compared to the concierge.

170
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:27,743
Isn't it his job to be polite?

171
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,414
You would think the
concierge would be polite.

172
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:31,227
It's not like we're being
obnoxious and asking someone

173
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:33,336
to take a picture of us in
front of Jim Morrison's grave.

174
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,349
Which, by the way,
I promised Rory we would do.

175
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:37,669
I hope G.G. picks up
the language and the customs,

176
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:39,030
but none of the rudeness.

177
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:41,678
Oh, no, G.G.'s too sweet.

178
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,001
She's got an impenetrable
coat of sweetness around her.

179
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,967
You shouldn't have called her G.G.,
you should've called her M&M's.

180
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,442
You were great with
her the whole flight.

181
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,935
You were also great
with Sherry today. Thank you.

182
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,250
She was great with me.

183
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,620
So, it's not just me, right?
She does seem to have it together?

184
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:55,996
Yeah, she seems
grounded and sincere.

185
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,290
She was nice. I couldn't believe
how prepared for G.G. she was.

186
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,496
She was.
She had her favorite "Madeline" book.

187
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,723
She knew where the
nearest park was.

188
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:03,668
And  did you see?
She already had a booster seat.

189
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,761
Very impressive. But by the time
I got Rory one of those,

190
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:08,456
she was 60 pounds.
It got stuck on her butt.

191
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,955
Oh, my god.

192
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:13,892
- What?
- We're in Paris!

193
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,370
You were thinking
it was Phoenix?

194
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:17,096
I just wasn't
thinking anything.

195
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,096
I mean, I was focused on getting G.G.
all settled in.

196
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:24,058
It slipped my mind that we're in the
most beautiful city in the world!

197
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:25,256
The Phoenix of Europe.

198
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,702
First we have to go to Harry's
bar and smoke gauloises cigarettes

199
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:30,553
and get in a fight about
cubism and gesticulate wildly.

200
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,729
I am going to call our
friend the concierge

201
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:36,593
and make a reservation at the most
romantic restaurant in Paris.

202
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:40,498
Ask him why these beds are
so insanely comfortable.

203
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,627
Yes, can I -- No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey!

204
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,637
No sleeping. We are in Paris now.
We are on Paris time.

205
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:47,710
- Fight the jet lag.
- Fighting the jet lag.

206
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:49,107
Jet lag strong.

207
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:54,239
Yes, I'm sorry, sir. Could I make
a 8:30 reservation at L'Arpège?

208
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,547
Yes...

209
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,098
Uh-huh, I-I understand.

210
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:01,443
Thank you.

211
00:09:01,964 --> 00:09:03,284
Did he book it?

212
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:06,236
He did. He also
reminded us to wear shoes.

213
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:08,368
I sense he has a very
low opinion of americans.

214
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,650
Well, the french might be rude,

215
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:12,873
but they know how to
make a very cozy bed.

216
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:14,034
- Lorelai?
- What?

217
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,730
- I know you're tired.
- A tad.

218
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:18,004
I know you've been awake for
something like 30 hours...

219
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:19,011
32 1/2.

220
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,257
...just to help me make the
transition easier for G.G.,

221
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:22,702
and I really appreciate it.

222
00:09:22,717 --> 00:09:24,259
Aww, don't mention it.

223
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,847
And I just want to show
you the best possible time

224
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:29,569
that you can have in Paris
because you deserve it.

225
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:32,313
Aww, you're sweet.

226
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:35,317
- Lorelai... Lorelai! Lorelai!
- Okay, all right.

227
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:37,175
Yes, we're gonna get up,
'cause we're in Paris,

228
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,844
and we're gonna have
a great parisian time.

229
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:39,968
- We are!
- Yes!

230
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:41,943
Hey, is the Tour de
France still going on?

231
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,507
'Cause we could stand on
a little Paris street

232
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,166
and yell "whoo-hoo"
when the guys go by,

233
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,069
or I could pour a cup of water on
one of them as he goes whooping by.

234
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:50,181
Actually, the Tour de France
was a couple of months ago.

235
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:52,617
But we are going to a beautiful,
intimate restaurant,

236
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:55,140
and after we finish our meal,
you can throw water on me.

237
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:56,548
Whoo-hoo!

238
00:09:58,854 --> 00:10:00,058
What are you doing right now?

239
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:00,796
Not much.

240
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,917
Would you mind swinging by
the library to drop these off?

241
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,370
I'd do it, but I just got
cornered by professor Edwards.

242
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,963
She wants to meet for
coffee in five minutes

243
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:09,343
to discuss me being her T.A.
second semester.

244
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:11,567
I got to start thinking
about life after graduation.

245
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,966
Cozying up to professor Edwards
could be a fast pass to a fellowship.

246
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:14,935
I guess that's true.

247
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,122
- What about you?
- What about me?

248
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,443
You looking into any fellowships?
Scholarships? Grad schools?

249
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:20,169
Not really. I mean, not yet.

250
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:21,724
I will, probably.

251
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:25,214
Time's running out. They only give
the Lsat one more time before spring.

252
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:26,834
Anyway, thanks for
dropping off the books.

253
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,320
I don't mean to make
you run out of your way.

254
00:10:28,355 --> 00:10:29,875
I just thought you have a lot of
free time since you don't work

255
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:31,420
- at the paper anymore.
- That is true.

256
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,483
What are you taking,
by the way?

257
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,270
Taking?

258
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:34,911
Just remember,
tricyclic antidepressants

259
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,029
are better than your
monoamine oxidase inhibitors,

260
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:38,537
since those are
for panic attacks.

261
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:39,667
It doesn't look like
you're there yet.

262
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:40,991
I have no plans of going there.

263
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:41,721
You will.

264
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:44,424
I  know when I was finished as editor,
I went into a major tailspin.

265
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:45,230
Can you tell ?

266
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:48,336
You masked it so well with your
generally gloomy disposition.

267
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:50,483
The first day is hard.
Then it just gets worse.

268
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,345
As it happens,
I am totally relieved

269
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:53,640
that my job at
the paper is over.

270
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:55,462
Yeah, I did the
denial thing, too.

271
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:58,405
I even tried smiling a lot. That got
old, and I think it made this line.

272
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:59,568
That'll teach you to smile.

273
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:01,657
You know, you really shouldn't
be alone at a time like this.

274
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,366
Why don't you call your
"girls gone wild" friends?

275
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,801
They seem delightful in a
"get crazy-drunk in Cancun

276
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:07,076
and flash your
breasts" kind of way.

277
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:09,300
Your take on Lucy and
Olivia is so not them.

278
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,799
Whatever. Later.

279
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:13,366
Oh, and Lexapro is fast-acting,
but side effects

280
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:15,882
are weight gain and noticeable
drop in sexual appetite.

281
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:18,289
Of course, with Logan gone,
that's moot.

282
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,369
Always a pleasure, Paris.

283
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,234
How's the maeun-tang?

284
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:40,603
- Good!
- Yeah!

285
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,484
Really good maeun-tang.

286
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,408
How was work?

287
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:51,546
- Oh, yeah, my work is good.
- My work is good.

288
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:53,195
That's good.

289
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,235
This is great dinner, mama.

290
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,512
I'm glad you like it.

291
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,831
It's been too long since
we had dinner together.

292
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:09,424
Way too long.

293
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,614
I think you've been avoiding me,
and I know why.

294
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,292
- We haven't been avoiding --
- Do not try to fool me.

295
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:16,855
I know what's going on.

296
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:24,137
You have no new music to show me,
and you are ashamed.

297
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,573
- Music?
- Yes, music --

298
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,232
the  thing you say you
want to do for a living.

299
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:29,402
Oh, no, I do!
Yeah, I've been working on some stuff.

300
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,426
What kind of stuff?

301
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,373
Actually, I've been experimenting
with different instruments.

302
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:34,558
Like, I've been playing electric
mandolin, which sound really--

303
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,037
Mom, I'm pregnant!

304
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:39,471
We waited until after we were married!
If you don't believe us,

305
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:41,417
we have a note from our doctor,

306
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,105
which doesn't prove anything,
but it does!

307
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,352
- Hit me! Hit me!
- Firmly established --

308
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:46,768
- It's my fault! Hit me!
- It happened during the --

309
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:50,758
A new child is a
great blessing.

310
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:52,563
Really?

311
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:55,114
Chuka hamnida, Lane and Zach.

312
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,847
She says, "congratulations."

313
00:12:56,862 --> 00:12:57,807
Really?

314
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:00,607
Then you should say
"chuka hamnida hamnida"

315
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,459
Because we're having twins.

316
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:04,348
- Twins?
- Twins.

317
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,533
Oh, that's wonderful.

318
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,179
So, monday,
you move in with me.

319
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,333
Cool.

320
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,735
I must go e-mail this good news
to our relatives in Pusan.

321
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,395
They just got wi-fi.

322
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,000
"Cool"?!

323
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:35,604
No! Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no!

324
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,386
- What? What?
- Honey, get up! Get up!

325
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,653
I'm up! I'm up! I'm up! I'm up!

326
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,962
What? We got to go, right?
I-I got to shave?

327
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,957
No, not unless
you're a werewolf!

328
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:43,995
What?

329
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,232
It's the middle of the night!

330
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:46,671
- What?
- It's 4:00!

331
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:48,608
- What's 4:00?
- That. It.

332
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,583
- It's 4:00?
- Yes! It's 4:00!

333
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,509
We fell asleep! Damn the french
and their comfortable beds!

334
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:56,050
Oh, we must've dozed
off around 7:00.

335
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:57,902
We just had ourselves
a 9-hour nap.

336
00:13:57,913 --> 00:13:59,676
Nine hours?! That's not a nap.

337
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:01,268
That's a coma.

338
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,453
Wow, the city looks
really beautiful...

339
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,893
and dead.

340
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:08,845
Ugh, okay -- this place is very
tastefully decorated and everything,

341
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,107
but would it kill them to
put a minibar in here?

342
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,956
- I'm starving.
- Me too.

343
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:16,315
You don't think they're still holding
our table at L'Arpège, do you?

344
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:18,844
I'm guessing our table at
L'Arpège smells of disinfectant

345
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,868
and has two chairs
on top of it.

346
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:24,457
It's okay, it's okay!
I can fix this!

347
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:26,968
Room service!
What are you in the mood for?

348
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:31,315
Um... I would like a cheeseburger
with a side of cheeseburger,

349
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,180
and see if they can make me
a cheeseburger smoothie.

350
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:36,481
Well, if they can make goose
innards into a tasty spread,

351
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:38,746
I'm sure they can make
a cheeseburger smoothie.

352
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:39,992
Yes, sir, hi.

353
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:42,333
I would like to order
some room service.

354
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:46,649
What'd he say?

355
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:49,228
He didn't say,
so much as chortle.

356
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:51,557
No room service?
And no minibar?

357
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:53,728
But two toilets.
Where are their priorities?

358
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,682
Okay, let me float
another plan.

359
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,619
Don't say "float" unless
"root beer" is attached to it.

360
00:14:57,653 --> 00:14:58,896
It's after 4:00.

361
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,333
Why don't we get a
few more hours' sleep,

362
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:02,954
we wake up early,
feast on a delicious french breakfast,

363
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,272
and then we hit Paris
totally refreshed.

364
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:06,922
Oh, fine...

365
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,905
Crummy Europe.
Crummy time change.

366
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:11,209
We switched to the
metric system --

367
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,762
why don't they switch
to our time zone?

368
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,846
- We didn't actually switch --
- I know!

369
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,580
Never been so wide awake.

370
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:36,856
I'm more wide awake.

371
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,189
So wide awake I could watch

372
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,341
the Ken Burns documentary
of "Sod" and not drift off.

373
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,902
There are 104 fleur-de-lis
stencil on the ceiling --

374
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,238
that's how wide awake I am.

375
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:47,193
I tried humming Brahms'
"Lullaby" in my head,

376
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,737
but it kept morphing
into "Purple Rain,"

377
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,348
and "Purple Rain" made
me think of grapes,

378
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:51,910
which made me think of grape jam,
which made me think

379
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:53,847
of english muffins
slathered in grape jam.

380
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:55,998
Hold it -- this is
the greatest city in the world.

381
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:57,580
There is a restaurant out there,
still open,

382
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:59,882
with candles and soft
lighting and great food,

383
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:01,569
and I'm gonna find it for you.

384
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:02,702
My hero.

385
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:05,079
Besides, just being out on the
Paris streets late at night --

386
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,930
what could be more romantic?

387
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,221
Being out on the Paris
streets late at night

388
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,400
eating a big, fat cheeseburger.

389
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:28,480
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Rory.

390
00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:29,831
Hey, what's going on?

391
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:31,173
Not a lot. What's up with you?

392
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:33,735
I'm sitting here making a
mobile for my sister's baby.

393
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,137
But it's turning
out really good,

394
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,666
so I might just keep it for myself
and give the baby a pair of socks.

395
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,211
Or make her a mobile
out of socks.

396
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:40,343
Oh, that's genius.

397
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:41,342
What's Lucy doing?

398
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:43,269
Watching "Real World: Denver."

399
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:46,376
Lucy's eating it up with a fork and
spoon 'cause boyfriend's working,

400
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,541
and you know how much
he hates reality TV.

401
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:49,347
Does he?

402
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:51,583
I keep forgetting --
you still haven't met boyfriend.

403
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,627
Yeah, I'm beginning to
wonder if he really exists,

404
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,621
or if he's just
Lucy's Snuffleupagus.

405
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:56,789
Lucy, it's Rory!

406
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:58,065
Hey! What's up, girl?

407
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:58,901
Hey, Lucy!

408
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,273
Rory says "hey."

409
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:01,872
You guys feel like
doing something?

410
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,016
We should go somewhere!

411
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,290
Cool, where do you want to go?

412
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:06,302
I want to go to the country,
I want to get off campus.

413
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,830
It's the weekend.
Let's get out of here.

414
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:10,074
I'd so love to go to,
like, a cabin in the woods.

415
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,117
Or just a house.

416
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,921
We could... go to my house.

417
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:13,994
Yeah?

418
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:16,998
I mean, it's in Stars Hollow.
It's this really small town,

419
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:18,445
and there's not a lot to do...

420
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,807
Oh, my god.
Does your house have a yard?

421
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,726
And a porch?

422
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:22,828
The house has a yard and
a porch with a swing,

423
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,526
and the swing makes this
little creaking sound.

424
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,241
That sounds so perfect.

425
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:28,822
When we get there, I'm definitely
mixing up a batch of lemonade

426
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,414
and flirting with Slim,
"The Hired Hand".

427
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,829
Slim The Hired Hand is a hottie,
but he's missing a hand.

428
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:33,664
Ironic, huh?

429
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,654
Pick you up in a little bit?

430
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:35,517
We'll be here.

431
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:36,522
Bye.

432
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:51,649
So, class,
the word for "closed" is...

433
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:53,583
You know, after seeing this sign
in seven different restaurants,

434
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,513
it's no longer informative--
It's just mocking.

435
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:56,748
This place looks good, too.

436
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,848
Even the sound of it -- Fermé.

437
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,720
- Let's try around the corner.
- It has a mocking tone.

438
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:03,262
"Ha ha,
fermé." Do you hear that?

439
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:05,909
I hear a woman who's delusional
with hunger. Come on.

440
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:07,682
See, this is why french
people are so skinny --

441
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:09,024
'cause they have no
late-night snacks.

442
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,347
How do you explain
Gérard Depardieu?

443
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:13,687
Oh, that's obvious. Gérard
Depardieu has hogged all the food.

444
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:17,753
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. Oh, I saw that.

445
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:18,681
Come on.

446
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,369
What do you say?
You hit him high, I hit him low.

447
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:21,769
Monsieur?!

448
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,372
Wait-- attendez!

449
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:25,164
We just want to know where
you got the sandwich!

450
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:26,644
- Oh, look what you did!
- What?

451
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:27,718
You charged him.

452
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,384
Everyone knows you
don't charge a bear

453
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,563
or a man with a sandwich.

454
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,015
That's a lot of bread.

455
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:37,711
What are the chances there's
a butter truck nearby?

456
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:41,308
Uh, pardonne-moi. Bonsoir.

457
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,924
- Nous avons, hungry, hungry...
- I got it. I got it.

458
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:47,856
Funny americans, huh?

459
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:50,147
Yeah, funny.
Hungry americans, huh?

460
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,219
"Everybody loves Raymond."

461
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:54,242
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

462
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,139
Happy people, the french.

463
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,291
What?

464
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:11,026
Nothing. It's weird...

465
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:13,174
it's just being this hungry
makes me think of this time

466
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,882
when we were in 10th grade,
and, for some reason,

467
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:17,358
I had to make up this
chemistry exam during lunch,

468
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,974
and it went on and on and on forever,
and then finally,

469
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,239
when I was done, I came out...

470
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,826
and there you were,
waiting for me.

471
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,394
And you took this slice of
pizza from the cafeteria

472
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:31,091
out of your coat pocket,
and you gave it to me.

473
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,326
Pepperoni -- I remember.

474
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:36,776
Even then, you were so sweet.

475
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:42,722
Head back to the hotel?

476
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:49,821
You don't still have that
pizza anywhere, do you?

477
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:52,008
- Different coat.
- Darn!

478
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:00,919
Babe, could you
check on my order?

479
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,334
Oh, I did. I asked Luke where it was,
and Luke said,

480
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,879
"from now on,
if Zach wants to eat here,

481
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:06,605
he has to stand on his head
in the middle of the diner

482
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,834
and eat out of a rusty bucket."

483
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:09,829
So I said, "cool!"

484
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,678
I couldn't help it, Lane!
I was so relieved

485
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:13,645
that your mother wasn't pissed
off about the pregnancy.

486
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:16,437
"Cool" just came out,
like a happy vocal burp.

487
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,383
Next time, cover your mouth!

488
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:19,734
Jeez!

489
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,684
Kirk, what are you doing?

490
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:23,188
Trying to feel a kick.

491
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:25,806
You're gonna feel a kick if you
don't get your hand off my stomach.

492
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:28,597
So, I don't know if you've decided where
you're gonna drop this little load,

493
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:31,357
but I highly recommend Woodbury
Memorial, where I was born.

494
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:32,201
Good to know.

495
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:34,177
The maternity suites
there are primo,

496
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:37,536
and they let the mother hold the baby
post-delivery as long as she wants.

497
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:40,076
Explains a lot about the relationship
between me and my mother.

498
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:41,763
- Yes, it does.
- Kirk, go away

499
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,057
and stop harassing
my employees.

500
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:46,021
You should sit awhile.

501
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,645
No, I'm fine!
Standing's no problem.

502
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,444
All right, but from now on,
no more serving heavy food --

503
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,032
your meat loaves, your bowls of stew.
Somebody who orders that--

504
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:54,701
let Caesar carry it.
He needs the workout.

505
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:56,906
- Well, that's not really --
- And if you have any questions

506
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:59,882
or are worried about anything
having to do with...

507
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:02,222
you know, what's going on there,
I'll call my sister, Liz --

508
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:03,448
she's a veteran.

509
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:05,011
Thanks, Luke.

510
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:06,910
Anyway, uh...

511
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,156
you two are gonna be great.

512
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,825
You'll be great parents.

513
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,037
Zach...

514
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:19,714
we're gonna be parents.

515
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:23,484
Yeah, it's like...
we're not just kids anymore.

516
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:25,795
We're one of them now.

517
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,190
Parents don't have to
be told what to do.

518
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,821
Parents do the telling.

519
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,010
That's right.

520
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:33,782
Besides, if we say no,
what's the worst your mother could do?

521
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:40,084
Seriously, b-babe,
w-what is the worst she could do?

522
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:43,048
Yeah.

523
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:44,620
What, "yeah"?

524
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,597
That's what I'm talking about.

525
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:47,899
Yeah?

526
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:49,417
I'll say.

527
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:51,584
I can barely talk.

528
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:53,711
Uh-huh, which is, uh...

529
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:55,391
Saying something?

530
00:21:57,148 --> 00:22:00,099
I could just live in
this room forever.

531
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:01,489
Let's.

532
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:03,102
- Except--
- No "except."

533
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,683
It's decided. Call the guy.

534
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,313
Come seal the doors.

535
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,596
- I'm too hungry!
- Me too.

536
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:10,485
My stomach is a pit.

537
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:13,506
I know. If I don't eat something,
my stomach's gonna eat me.

538
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:15,356
We need to find food!

539
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:16,622
We do!

540
00:22:18,114 --> 00:22:19,711
Look at that view.

541
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:21,877
It's so beautiful,
I could eat it.

542
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,743
- Oh, my god.
- What?

543
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,623
- I could totally fix this!
- How?

544
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,265
I'm not gonna tell you.

545
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,605
- Let's shower.
- Tell me.

546
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:31,737
- It's a surprise.
- Tell me.

547
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:32,984
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Come on!

548
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,223
Not telling.

549
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:36,245
Is this your fix?

550
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,308
To get me to think
about what your fix is

551
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:40,034
instead of thinking
about food, huh?!

552
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:41,326
- Is it working?
- A little.

553
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:43,350
All I can tell you is it's
bigger than a breadbox.

554
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:44,993
Mmm, bread.

555
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:46,901
- Come on!
- Okay!

556
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,214
There's Dean.

557
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:49,710
Ooh, Dean is smokin'.

558
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:51,274
Oh, yeah. Dean's a fox.

559
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,433
- He looks tall.
- He is.

560
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:53,871
How can you tell from
a picture of his face?

561
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,359
- It's a talent I have.
- Spooky.

562
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,054
Yeah, right, I figure I'll be
recruit by the FBI any day now.

563
00:22:58,068 --> 00:22:59,964
It's a very specific specialty.

564
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:01,448
Wait, there you are.

565
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,750
Oh yeah. That was my first
year at the Chilton paper.

566
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:05,630
Look at you and your
big Rory smile.

567
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:06,944
What are you there -- 5'2"?

568
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,094
More like 5'7".

569
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,552
Are you sure?
You don't look like 5'7".

570
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,246
I'm sure. Is this dye supposed
to smell all vinegary?

571
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:13,464
Mm-hmm. It means it's working.

572
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,655
I feel like an easter egg.

573
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:16,658
Boyfriend is gonna totally
freak when he sees this color.

574
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:18,000
- Freak, like, be mad?
- No.

575
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,217
First, he'll be like,
"whoa," and then like, "I like it,"

576
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,471
and I'll be like,
"thanks," and he'll be all,

577
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,332
"I thought you looked
pretty good before, too,"

578
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:26,354
and I'll be like,
"better?" And he'll be like,

579
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,148
"No, I think you look good
no matter what you do,"

580
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,892
and I'll be like,
"what if I got a mohawk?"

581
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,716
and he'll be like,
"even if you had a mohawk,"

582
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:33,789
and then we'll look at each other
all goony-eyed, and we'll kiss,

583
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:35,695
and he'll say,
"don't get a mohawk."

584
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:37,059
And too bad if he
doesn't like it.

585
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:38,890
Serves him right for
working all the time.

586
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:40,251
Boyfriend's got great hair.

587
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:42,266
Oh, the best.
It's, like, beyond human.

588
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,694
Like, Conan O'Brien's?

589
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,124
No, it's, like, really full.

590
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:46,397
It's more like a
cartoon character.

591
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:48,882
Yeah, it's like Snap's hair from Snap,
Crackle, and Pop.

592
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:50,214
Wait, am I thinking of Crackle?

593
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,442
Is Crackle the one
who wears a hat?

594
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:53,267
They all wear hats.
It's like part of their uniform.

595
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,068
Yeah, but one of them wears
it all the way on his head,

596
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:57,330
and one wears it further
back so his bangs swoop out.

597
00:23:57,347 --> 00:23:59,374
That's Pop.
The blond one's definitely Pop.

598
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:02,004
Okay, so boyfriend's got the color
of Crackle and the style of Pop.

599
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:03,508
Ooh! We should make
Rice Krispy treats.

600
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:04,946
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yes!

601
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,812
I think there is a cake
pan in that broom closet.

602
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:09,609
Broom closet?

603
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:12,246
Yeah, my mom's not really
into baking or brooms.

604
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,307
Okay, so the butter's
in the fridge,

605
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:16,809
and I will get the marshmallows
and the Rice Krispies.

606
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:19,870
Oh, my god!
Come here, you guys!

607
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:21,969
It's Rory through the ages.

608
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,253
Oh, I totally forgot
that was there.

609
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,687
How cool is this? Can you believe
you were this short in 1991?

610
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:28,270
No.

611
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:30,198
Check it out.
The next year, you shot up like a weed.

612
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,683
That's when I
finally quit smoking.

613
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:34,446
This is awesome. You have a record
here of you literally growing up,

614
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:36,318
and here you are when you're,
like, 7,

615
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:38,658
and then here you are when you're
ready to graduate college.

616
00:24:38,672 --> 00:24:39,923
Yeah.

617
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,446
It's freaky.

618
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:43,357
Oh! There's the cake pan.

619
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:45,197
Let's get cookin'!

620
00:24:46,507 --> 00:24:49,113
Well, well,
what do you know? Fermé.

621
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,988
Listen, honey,
if they weren't open at 11:00,

622
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,696
I don't think they're gonna be
open at 5:00 in the morning.

623
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,587
Trust me.

624
00:24:54,604 --> 00:24:56,527
Trust is not the point.

625
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,416
The point is food
and finding some,

626
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,971
not standing in front of
closed restaurants feel--

627
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:04,187
Monsieur Hayden...

628
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:05,511
mademoiselle Gilmore.

629
00:25:05,525 --> 00:25:06,720
That's us.

630
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:08,696
Welcome to L'Arpège.

631
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,250
Please come in.

632
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:11,974
Your table is ready.

633
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:14,671
After you, mademoiselle.

634
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,518
Thank you.

635
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,821
Thank you.

636
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:34,168
Thanks. What is this?

637
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:37,159
I'll give you a moment
to peruse the wine list.

638
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:39,259
Please let me know if
you have any question.

639
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:40,747
Thank you. We will.

640
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:42,292
Merci.

641
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,239
Pretty cool, huh?

642
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:48,312
How did you --

643
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:51,352
I'm thinking the '78 Latour.
Sounds like a classic car.

644
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:54,002
Honey, how did you do this?

645
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:55,726
I have my ways.

646
00:25:55,743 --> 00:25:57,414
Tell me!

647
00:25:57,937 --> 00:25:59,612
- You really want to know?
- Yeah!

648
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:00,869
It might take away
some of the magic.

649
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:02,237
I'll risk it.

650
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,563
Well, I was lying in bed,
and I was thinking about us,

651
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,999
and how, when we were 16,
we planned our trip to Paris,

652
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:12,461
but it kind of got derailed.

653
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:14,073
I'll say.

654
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:17,383
And then I was thinking about how
amazing it is that after everything --

655
00:26:17,397 --> 00:26:20,775
the years, the distance,
the screw-ups, everything --

656
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:24,029
we finally managed to make it
here and how, in some ways,

657
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:27,395
it feels like nothing has
changed and no time has passed.

658
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,506
I know.

659
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,907
But then I started thinking about
all the things that have changed.

660
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:35,267
When did you do
all this thinking?

661
00:26:35,282 --> 00:26:38,730
And I realized the one
big thing that has changed

662
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:42,259
is that now...
I'm totally loaded.

663
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:43,632
Okay.

664
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:45,857
And I guess, in some ways,
I'm not quite used to it

665
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,686
because I didn't
even think earlier

666
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:50,323
that I might be
able to use that.

667
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,012
You totally bribed
them to open.

668
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:56,126
Not bribed --
gave financial incentive.

669
00:26:56,142 --> 00:26:57,756
Oh, my god!

670
00:26:57,994 --> 00:26:58,803
I know.

671
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,789
You totally bribed
them to open!

672
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:03,935
You don't have to whisper.
Everybody here knows.

673
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,624
I just can't believe that
people really... do this.

674
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,014
Apparently.

675
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,912
- Cool!
- Right?

676
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:13,802
And I was prepared to do
other things to get you fed.

677
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,690
I mean, I had backup plans that
included theft and chicanery.

678
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,752
Ooh. Chicanery? For me?

679
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,450
Anything for you.

680
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,183
Anything.

681
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,746
So, you happy?

682
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:26,759
Really happy.

683
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,041
This is wonderful.

684
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,900
You didn't have to do it,
you know?

685
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:33,195
I wanted to.

686
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:35,160
I would've been happy
with a croissant.

687
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:37,144
Or a park bench. I know.

688
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:38,881
Why a park bench?

689
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:41,412
Remember when we were 16
and planning to go to Paris?

690
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,551
We always said we'd
sleep on a park bench.

691
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,394
Oh, yeah!

692
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:48,212
Well, because we didn't have any money,
so we couldn't afford a hotel,

693
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:50,506
we'd have to sleep
on a park bench.

694
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:52,759
I can't believe
you remember that.

695
00:27:53,752 --> 00:27:56,586
I'd still sleep on a
park bench with you.

696
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,696
Name the bench.

697
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,198
Compliments of the chef...

698
00:28:01,607 --> 00:28:05,934
langoustine on a bed of mush
and candied carrot cannelle.

699
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:07,673
Have you decided on the wine?

700
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:10,627
Yes. We're gonna go
with the '78 Latour.

701
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,353
Excellent choice, monsieur.

702
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:18,555
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

703
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:21,969
So, this fix?

704
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:23,746
Not only bigger
than a breadbox,

705
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,240
also a lot better.

706
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:26,699
Told you.

707
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,944
Hey, when we're done,

708
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,869
can we go back to
that beautiful bed?

709
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:33,489
You don't want to
sleep on a park bench?

710
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,532
Mmm... no park bench.

711
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,871
Thank god.

712
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,120
Oh yes, this is very nice.

713
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:53,151
So, mama, the reason we wanted
to talk to you is 'cause --

714
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:55,126
If you're wondering about your room,
it isn't ready yet.

715
00:28:55,158 --> 00:28:57,512
We weren't wondering -- mama!

716
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,221
You want two separate
beds, correct?

717
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:00,801
Well, that's not
really the issue.

718
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:02,000
Better for Zach to
have his own bed.

719
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,398
Soon, you will be giant.
Who can sleep with that?

720
00:29:04,414 --> 00:29:07,582
Mama, could you stop for a minute?
We really need to talk.

721
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:10,717
I have to unload this shipment.
I may be old, but I can multitask.

722
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:12,137
The thing is, Mrs. Kim,

723
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:15,294
when you said that we should move
in with you and I said, "cool,"

724
00:29:15,306 --> 00:29:17,757
what I meant was,
"that's cool...

725
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:20,175
that you're offering to
have us move in, but...

726
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,116
no."

727
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:22,523
What do you mean, "no"?

728
00:29:22,588 --> 00:29:24,828
We really appreciate
the offer, mama,

729
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,637
But Zach and I are going to be
parents soon, and we're adults...

730
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:29,910
You know, young adults.
Not like I'm gonna be smoking a pipe,

731
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:31,877
and she's gonna be all, "hey,
let's watch '60 minutes.'"

732
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:33,811
...and we're gonna be
starting our own family,

733
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:37,849
and it's important to us that
we do that in our own home.

734
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:41,773
We can do this, mama.
We're ready.

735
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:46,827
Very well.
I respect your decision.

736
00:29:52,212 --> 00:29:53,568
Cool!

737
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,699
How much do you love this hair?

738
00:29:55,713 --> 00:29:56,840
So much!

739
00:29:56,854 --> 00:29:58,959
Okay, now we're gonna have
to start a girl band.

740
00:29:58,973 --> 00:29:59,956
We so have to.

741
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,451
We'll pretend we're a
norwegian girl band,

742
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:03,333
and we can purposely
lip-synch just slightly off.

743
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:04,935
- Oh, we'll be famous!
- We'll be huge!

744
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:07,377
You can write articles about
us in the Yale Daily News.

745
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:07,994
Yeah.

746
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,947
You can say things like, we're the
hottest thing to come out of
Norway since...

747
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:12,192
what came out of Norway?

748
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,984
Well, we got the vikings,
we got Edvard Munch,

749
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:16,748
and that's all I got.

750
00:30:16,764 --> 00:30:18,675
I mean, you still have an
in at the newspaper, right?

751
00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:21,313
Sure she does. It's like once you're
president, you're president forever,

752
00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:22,617
unless you get assassinated.

753
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:25,005
Actually, it's good Rory's
not editor anymore.

754
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:26,732
More time to be in "The
Forbidden Fjords."

755
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:27,805
Okay, yeah. Wait.

756
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,122
We need to discuss the name.

757
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:31,680
Rory, where are you on
"The Forbidden Fjords"?

758
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:34,347
Oh, my god.

759
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:36,350
Rory, are you okay?

760
00:30:36,364 --> 00:30:38,010
- I'm fine.
- Do you hate your hair?

761
00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:39,362
- 'Cause you can change it.
- So easy.

762
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:41,893
No, no, no, I love my hair.

763
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,967
It's -- it's nothing.
It's stupide.

764
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:46,218
- It's not nothing.
- What is it?

765
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:50,307
Everything is just... ending.

766
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,267
I just feel like everything
is gonna be over.

767
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,583
I'm done at the paper.

768
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,011
Soon I'm gonna be done at Yale,

769
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:58,094
and it's just like I'm
standing on this cliff,

770
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,403
looking out into
this huge, foggy...

771
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:01,659
Abyss?

772
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,646
...like, a huge, foggy abyss,

773
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:07,032
and in my whole life,
there's never been an abyss.

774
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:08,115
It's been abyssless.

775
00:31:08,128 --> 00:31:10,965
I've always known exactly
what is in front of me,

776
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:13,417
and I've always known
exactly where I'm going,

777
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:14,855
and now...

778
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:16,593
I don't know what's out there.

779
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,734
Besides fog.

780
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:20,774
A ton of fog, and I hate not
kwowing what is out there.

781
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:22,673
I mean,
what's going to happen to my career

782
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:25,983
and my relationship with
Logan and the rest of my life?

783
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:27,527
Rory...

784
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:31,219
I'm so sorry,
I don't mean to...

785
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:33,061
drag everything down.

786
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:34,624
I so know what you're
talking about.

787
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:35,868
Totally!

788
00:31:35,885 --> 00:31:37,520
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

789
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:39,225
Once I move that tassel
to the other side,

790
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:40,884
I have no idea what
the hell I'm gonna do.

791
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,331
I mean, besides that FBI gig.

792
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:44,538
I'm an art major --

793
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:47,300
not like that's an obvious road
sign to the rest of my life.

794
00:31:47,316 --> 00:31:49,306
I can't believe you
guys worry about this.

795
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,440
I mean,
you're so carpe diem-ish.

796
00:31:52,456 --> 00:31:54,310
How could you not be
worried about it?

797
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:56,161
Everywhere you turn on campus,
someone's talking

798
00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:57,881
about their brilliant
plans for next year.

799
00:31:57,895 --> 00:31:59,997
Even our friends that were
really cool on laid-back --

800
00:32:00,015 --> 00:32:01,775
english majors,
philosophy majors --

801
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,989
they're talking about
coming investment bankers.

802
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:05,648
- When did that happen?
- Traitors.

803
00:32:05,663 --> 00:32:08,277
The other day, somebody used the
phrase "negative amortization."

804
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,089
What the hell is that?!

805
00:32:14,877 --> 00:32:17,510
I have no idea what I'm doing.

806
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,065
Maybe I should be
applying to grad schools.

807
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:23,304
I mean...

808
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,741
journalism school
or law school.

809
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:27,361
Maybe I should go
to law school.

810
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,661
Dude, you don't want
to go to law school.

811
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:32,186
So don't want to
go to law school.

812
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:39,944
You're amazing.

813
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,188
No, you are.

814
00:32:41,204 --> 00:32:43,512
Don't start a fight with me.
I'm trying to say thank you.

815
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:44,767
You're welcome.

816
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:47,472
I mean, this is ridiculous.
This is incredible.

817
00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:48,988
Here we are just
finishing dinner,

818
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,296
and the sun is coming up and
people are just going to work.

819
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:52,833
I mean,
it's just all so unreal.

820
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,537
I feel like any minute the
waiters could break into song.

821
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,196
Well, if you want...

822
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:00,976
What?

823
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:02,856
I'm just so happy.

824
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:04,619
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

825
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:06,258
I don't ever want
to leave Paris.

826
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,171
I know.

827
00:33:07,183 --> 00:33:09,663
I don't want it to be over,
I don't want it to end.

828
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,765
It doesn't have to end.
When we get back to Stars Hollow,

829
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:15,445
we can sleep all day and wander the
town in the middle of the night, and...

830
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,471
that stuff we did back
in the hotel room --

831
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:20,731
we can definitely do that
back in Stars Hollow.

832
00:33:20,744 --> 00:33:22,532
Are you saying we'll
always have Paris?

833
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:24,480
I'm saying I love you, Lorelai.

834
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:26,246
I love you, too.

835
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:28,587
- And, Lor?
- What?

836
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:33,133
Remember when I told you that I
would wait till we were both 80

837
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,086
for you to figure out us?

838
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:39,030
U-us?

839
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:40,987
You and me?

840
00:33:41,423 --> 00:33:42,790
Right.

841
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,886
I don't want to wait.

842
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,979
- Chris...
- I mean it.

843
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:54,826
But don't you think it's --
it's too soon?

844
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,083
No.

845
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:57,961
We've only been
dating a few months.

846
00:33:57,976 --> 00:33:59,197
Try 25 years.

847
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:00,627
I know,
but you know what I mean.

848
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:02,719
So it's taken us this long to
work it out, to figure it out,

849
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,578
but we're here now.
We're ready.

850
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:07,858
We're finally ready. Let's do it.
Let's do it right here in Paris.

851
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:09,161
No, not here.

852
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:10,984
- Why not?
- Well, Rory...

853
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:12,882
Rory? Rory will be thrilled.

854
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,671
Honey, I love you,
I really do, but...

855
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:19,250
I think we should wait.

856
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,554
Come on, Lor.

857
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:23,029
We love each other.
We belong together.

858
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,787
What do you say?

859
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,182
Marry me.

860
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:31,392
No.

861
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:33,936
But those are cool names,
and whenever we call for "Marco,"

862
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,974
Polo would answer with his name,
so we'd always know where he was.

863
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,165
No.

864
00:34:38,532 --> 00:34:40,600
We don't even know if
they're going to be boys.

865
00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:42,881
- Mama!
- This place is a death trap!

866
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:45,067
- What are you doing?
- We must think like a baby.

867
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,120
Anything that can be grabbed
with little baby hands

868
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:49,624
must be put up high or
locked away in cupboards.

869
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,668
- How'd she get in?
- Who couldn't get in?

870
00:34:51,682 --> 00:34:55,147
Hiding a key under the mat is like
hosting a burglars-only open house.

871
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:56,961
Mama, we're gonna
baby-proof the apartment,

872
00:34:56,974 --> 00:34:58,266
but we've still
got like months.

873
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:59,791
Of course,
the drum kit has to go into storage,

874
00:34:59,825 --> 00:35:01,776
and you must throw
away all of these.

875
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:02,830
My guitar picks?

876
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:04,146
To you, they are guitar picks.

877
00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:06,831
To a baby, they are candy
waiting to be choked on.

878
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:09,494
That's true. One time,
I was tuning to an open "e"

879
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:11,002
and holding a pick
between my teeth,

880
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:13,256
and Brian made this really funny sound,
and I snorted a laugh,

881
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,472
so the pick went shooting
to the back of my throat.

882
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:16,939
Mama, did you shop for us?

883
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:19,787
Yes, and I will cook dinner as
soon as I am finished unpacking.

884
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:22,078
- Unpacking?
- My things.

885
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,650
You are right.
You are adults now.

886
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,539
You should raise your
children in your own home.

887
00:35:25,554 --> 00:35:27,399
It would be wrong for
you to move in with me,

888
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:29,522
so I will move in with you.

889
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:30,746
Cool?

890
00:35:32,153 --> 00:35:33,481
Mama?

891
00:35:33,494 --> 00:35:34,795
Where's Brian?

892
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:37,278
Don't worry about Brian.
Brian is fine.

893
00:35:37,398 --> 00:35:39,841
Um, could you please
pass the bulgogi?

894
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,049
- French fries.
- Yep.

895
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,303
Definitely french fries.

896
00:35:46,317 --> 00:35:48,511
Even if I haven't even gone
within a mile of one...

897
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,342
Always smell like french
fries after a road trip.

898
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:53,891
Smell like, feel like, a thin layer
of vegetable grease all over me.

899
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:58,108
- Boyfriend!
- Hey!

900
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,419
- I think boyfriend's here.
- No way.

901
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:03,699
So once we saw the hair,
it was obvious -- girl band.

902
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:06,010
Rory has the most awesome house.
You have to meet Rory.

903
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:09,264
Rory... this is boyfriend.

904
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:11,526
- Oh! I --
- Actually, it's Marty.

905
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,088
Nice to meet you.

906
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:15,054
You too.

907
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:18,853
Okay... I got to show the dresses you're
talking about for our norwegian band.

908
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:20,195
So perfect. Go get yours.

909
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,257
You're going to be, like,
"we have to wear these dresses."

910
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,000
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

911
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,310
Um... why did you just pretend
like you didn't know me?

912
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:31,646
I just thought it
would be weird.

913
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:33,285
Weird? That we were friends?

914
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:34,447
Why would that be weird?

915
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:37,459
Well, what's the difference?
I mean, it's not important.

916
00:36:37,473 --> 00:36:38,676
But...

917
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:41,258
yeah, but we used to
hang out all the time.

918
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,703
Ta-da!

919
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,919
Give it up for The
Forbidden Fjords!

920
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,242
- Aren't these perfect?
- They are. They're perfect.

921
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:49,186
Two Halloweens ago,
Lucy and I went to a party

922
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:51,691
as "And Dawn,"
without Tony Orlando.

923
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:52,842
Do you like me in this dress?

924
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:55,746
Yeah. You look nice and shiny.
Goes great with your hair.

925
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,319
Thank you. Was I right?

926
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,895
Doesn't boyfriend
have unreal hair?

927
00:36:58,907 --> 00:36:59,969
He does.

928
00:36:59,983 --> 00:37:02,702
- So, the road trip --
- Was so far out?

929
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:04,994
The town where Rory grew up is,
like, your perfect small town.

930
00:37:05,027 --> 00:37:06,605
You expect professor
Harold Hill to move there

931
00:37:06,637 --> 00:37:08,359
and sucker everyone into
buying band instruments.

932
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,736
It's, like, ideal, but not scary,
"a serial killer lives next door" ideal.

933
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,367
4-h club ideal.

934
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,085
Bonsoir, house.

935
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,771
Feels good to be home, huh?

936
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:32,190
So good.

937
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,629
It's funny when you go away,

938
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:36,209
even on a short trip...

939
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:38,377
everything looks a little
different when you get back.

940
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,500
Yep.

941
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:43,270
Of course, now I'm seeing it
with a french perspective.

942
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:44,494
How's it look in french?

943
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,633
American and dusty.

944
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:49,625
I'm gonna go get the
rest of our stuff.

945
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:53,848
Welcome home, Mrs. Hayden.
