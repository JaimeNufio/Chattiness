1
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:22,053
So is this more or less fun than watching the same T.V. show at the same time?

2
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:23,843
I think it's more.

3
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:25,999
You know, if we died right now,

4
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:27,060
and decomposed,

5
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:29,812
it would vacuum us up and no one would ever know.

6
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:31,371
Freaky.

7
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,264
I'm walking on sunshine! Whoa!

8
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:35,812
I’m walking on sunshine, whoa!

9
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:39,228
I’m walking on sunshine, whoa!

10
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:42,412
And don’t it feel good! Hey, all right!

11
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:42,970
Hey!

12
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,770
What?

13
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,320
Learn a new song, or I am tying you to a chair and putting Hotel Rwanda on again.

14
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:48,745
It’s love, baby. Deal.

15
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:51,002
You’re not going to use that as a microphone, are you?

16
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:53,489
Oh, no, Reverend has the town band dancing and singing?

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,948
I’m really happy.

18
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:56,009
Doyle, I assume?

19
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:58,430
You know, he calls me his girlfriend now with no visible shaking.

20
00:01:58,463 --> 00:01:59,591
I’m happy you’re happy.

21
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:00,983
So, how are things with Logan?

22
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,574
You want to hand me that hairbrush?

23
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:03,371
Look at us.

24
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:05,328
We’re happy, we have boyfriends!

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,611
This is infinitely better than any mood stabilizer I have ever been on.

26
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:10,171
Oh, shoot, what time is it?

27
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:11,199
It’s Hammer time.

28
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,658
It’s Logan. Hairbrushes down.

29
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:13,587
You got it.

30
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:17,832
- Evening, Ace.
- Hi.

31
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,584
Nice. Very nice.

32
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,403
Hey, you want to see my room? It’s far away from here.

33
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:24,232
Super idea.

34
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:38,245
- Hello.
- Hello.

35
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,372
What are you thinking about?

36
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:41,859
Whether or not you’ve ever woken up with Paris standing over you with a knife.

37
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:43,882
Not recently. She’s been in a good mood.

38
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:44,545
Why is that?

39
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:45,640
Because she’s in love.

40
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:46,469
With Doyle?

41
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:48,823
Yes, with Doyle. And do not mock or make fun,

42
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:51,311
because when Paris is happy, the whole world is happy.

43
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:54,030
But when she’s not happy, the whole world is Deadwood.

44
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:55,323
Got it. You hungry?

45
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:58,308
Yes, I’m starving. Just let me get my sweater.

46
00:02:59,223 --> 00:02:59,688
Hey,

47
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:01,478
what do you think of this dress?

48
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,137
Does it look newspaper-y enough?

49
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:03,634
What?

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,690
I’m trying to figure out what to wear on my first day at the paper.

51
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:08,011
Ah, the internship rears its ugly head again.

52
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:10,598
I want to look professional but not too Lois Lane-y,

53
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,422
and I don’t want to look like a college kid.

54
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:13,516
You are a college kid.

55
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:14,478
Not on Monday.

56
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,031
On Monday, I am a newspaper woman.

57
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:19,187
And I have to look like a newspaper woman.

58
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:20,281
Whatever you wear will be fine.

59
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:21,707
I’m so excited.

60
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,470
I can tell.

61
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:24,959
Oh. Last night, I couldn’t sleep,

62
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,551
so I Googled your father.

63
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:27,280
Excuse me?

64
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,066
Twelve thousand fifty three items came up.

65
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,050
I could only pull up a couple thousand, but it really helped.

66
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:36,333
He was born in 1953, Episcopalian,

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,157
second of four children, oldest boy,

68
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:39,915
Yale undergrad, star of the track team.

69
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,606
No grad school. Interesting.

70
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:46,282
Then he had a couple of lost years. Kind of a blank period, a little Jesus thing going on there.

71
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:48,272
Worked as a reporter and editor

72
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:52,119
of the Huntzberger papers
before taking over as CEO of the company!

73
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:54,308
I mean, when you look at all these accomplishments,

74
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,469
the man must never sleep!

75
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:55,823
Well -

76
00:03:55,853 --> 00:03:57,600
Ah. Mm-hm, four hours a night.

77
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:58,340
Just like Clinton.

78
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:01,557
You don’t have a wall in a secret room with pictures of my father pasted all over it,

79
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,152
Logan, I’m going to be interning for him.

80
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,077
I need to know everything about him.

81
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:08,903
Is he an egghead? Because he seems very roll-up-the-sleeves-y.

82
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:13,060
But he’s written about everything, from foreign affairs, domestic policies.

83
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:14,974
He had a wine column, for God’s sake.

84
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:15,982
I should learn more about wine.

85
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,704
Look, Rory -

86
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:17,675
What are his politics?

87
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,630
He’s unbelievably neutral in his writing!

88
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,542
Right wing, left wing, middle wing.

89
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,584
Oh, the man was short-listed for the Pulitzer

90
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:26,360
for covering the Iranian hostage crisis when he was twenty-five!

91
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:27,530
Yeah, I heard something about that.

92
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:28,401
Twenty-five!

93
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:29,394
How did he do that?

94
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:31,199
Especially considering his lost years?

95
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:33,116
He’s a born journalist.

96
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:34,497
I mean, what does he read?

97
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:35,580
What papers,

98
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:36,390
what journals?

99
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:37,697
Come on, tell me something.

100
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,013
He hates peas.

101
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,457
Logan, I need your help here.

102
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,834
Rory, my dad and I basically have two conversations.

103
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,602
‘Logan, you’re not living up to your potential’

104
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:49,603
and ‘Logan, when you’re sailing close-hauled, wait until you gain
that last bit of boat speed before you pull in the jib sheet. ’ That’s it.

105
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:50,437
- But -
- Ace!

106
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:53,082
You’ve learned more about my father in one night than I’ve learned in my whole life!

107
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:54,763
Don’t worry. You’re going to be fine!

108
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,818
Now, I thought we’ve established that we’re both starving.

109
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,710
Yes, we have. Let’s go.

110
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,243
Oh! Wait!

111
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:05,355
Your dad covered Haiti in 1985.

112
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:06,696
Must learn more about Haiti.

113
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,132
Got it.

114
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,501
Okay, let’s go.

115
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,601
Hey, have you ever discussed Pinochet with him? Because one time he wrote -

116
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:12,459
Peas, Ace. Peas.

117
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:13,679
Right. Sorry.

118
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,374
As we move on from the empiricist to the rationalist,

119
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,056
it would be good to start thinking about the differences between the A posteriori truths,

120
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:23,272
and the Apriority truths of the rationalist,

121
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,463
which exists independent of experience.

122
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:31,012
So for Wednesday if you would all take a crack at the first five chapters of Spinoza’s Ethics.

123
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:36,846
That is, those of you who’s entire weekend won’t be consumed by books on wine and Haiti.

124
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:37,705
Yes.

125
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,294
My interests are teasingly diverse.

126
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:41,651
Whatever.

127
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,104
See you all on Wednesday.

128
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:52,072
Hello?

129
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:54,312
Ah, thank God. Did you return the blue sweater?

130
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:55,022
Oh, no.

131
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,043
Answer, please.

132
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,561
- Two days ago.
- Why?

133
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,599
Why? Because two days ago you asked me to take it back.

134
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,768
Demanded me, in fact.

135
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,303
And suddenly you’re just so freakin’ reliable, you just hop to it and do whatever I say?

136
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:08,029
I’ve always been freakin’ reliable. It’s how I was raised.

137
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:09,232
Oh, so blame me.

138
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:12,307
I am not returning the blue sweater again, so don’t think about asking.

139
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:13,925
But I want it, I need it.

140
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:16,300
I’ve already returned the Capri pants twice.

141
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:19,972
I’ve tried to return a couple of your other items that were all sales final,

142
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:21,391
which makes me look retail simple.

143
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:22,670
And this is not the first,

144
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,450
but the second time I will have returned the blue sweater.

145
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,610
Ooh, the Capri pants. Have you taken those back yet?

146
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,980
I can’t show my face in any stores in New Haven.

147
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:31,319
They think I’m Paper Mooning them.

148
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:34,630
Oh, she was very cute in Paper Moon. You’re very cute, too.

149
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:37,403
Calling me cute is not going to persuade me. And I have classes.

150
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:37,876
A life.

151
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,806
Monday afternoon. That’s your free time, right?

152
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,398
I remember some bragging to that effect.

153
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,169
Go back on Monday.

154
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,286
Oh. Well, Monday used to be free.

155
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,150
Used to be? It’s not free anymore?

156
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:48,254
I guess we haven’t talked in a couple of days.

157
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:48,988
Um,

158
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,445
I actually got an internship.

159
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,129
Really?

160
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:54,548
Kind of an important high-profile one.

161
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,266
Wow! That’s great!

162
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:58,955
It’s for a newspaper in Stamford that Logan’s dad acquired.

163
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,273
He offered me the spot himself.

164
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:01,431
Logan’s dad.

165
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,198
Yeah. It was kind of out of the blue.

166
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,849
So when did you hear?

167
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:06,107
Just a few days ago.

168
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:08,484
I forgot I hadn’t told you, I start on Monday.

169
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,215
Wow, congratulations!

170
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,005
It’s a pretty amazing opportunity.

171
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,537
Yeah, sounds like it.

172
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,425
You’ll be having lunch with the off-bet editors from the Times.

173
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:17,684
Hanging out with Peter Jennings.

174
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:19,584
Dan Rather will be valet parking your car.

175
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:22,870
Yeah, it’s more likely that I’ll be pulling wire reports off the AP machine, but sure.

176
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:25,556
Good, good. So, no worries on the blue sweater front.

177
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:26,838
It’s off my radar screen.

178
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:28,556
Really? So you’re really not going to make the effort?

179
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:30,482
I’ll see if I can swing by on Tuesday.

180
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:32,511
Just send your assistant. You’re getting an assistant, right?

181
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:34,354
Oh, I’m sure. I’ll see you Friday night.

182
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:35,387
- Bye, hon.
- Bye.

183
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:37,603
Taylor?

184
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:39,654
Hello, is someone out there?

185
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:41,507
Where are you, Taylor?

186
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,802
Over here!

187
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:43,885
I can’t move!

188
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,728
Oh, I have got to get a camera.

189
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:51,226
How in the hell did you do this?

190
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:55,343
I was doing a little light dusting, and was toying with the idea
of

191
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:58,679
repositioning the horse’s hindquarters, and the whole thing came tumbling down.

192
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:00,133
You can’t leave anything alone, can you?

193
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:01,962
Are you going to help me, or not?

194
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,004
I feel like I’ve been lying here for days.

195
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,647
You have not been lying here for days.

196
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:07,437
Kirk came into the diner two hours ago.

197
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,578
You waited two hours to come and get me?

198
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,184
I have a business.

199
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:14,678
I can’t come running every time a family of mannequins decides to attack you.

200
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:16,658
- Ow!
- Just lie still.

201
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:18,450
Oh, this is so humiliating.

202
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,330
Taylor, don’t you think it’s time?

203
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,209
Time for what?

204
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,031
You’ve been trapped under the Jebediahs for two hours and no one has come in here.

205
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:26,151
What’s your point, Luke?

206
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,280
My point is the museum’s a bust.

207
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:31,115
Well, I’ll admit. Attendance is low.

208
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:32,820
No one is coming!

209
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,858
I was reading an article about the power of bus bench ads for getting the word out.

210
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:42,573
Very big in the music industry. Apparently the rapper, Fitty Cent, swears by them.

211
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:44,540
Taylor, come on. Isn’t it time to sell?

212
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,478
Let somebody who really wants this place have it!

213
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:50,861
I guess it is. I had such dreams.

214
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:52,131
There’ll be other dreams.

215
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:53,724
I guess.

216
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,771
You can resume your attempts to get me out of here.

217
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,787
You’re definitely ready to sell the house?

218
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:00,020
Yes.

219
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:02,833
Then let’s get you out of here.

220
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:04,958
Tennis lessons? That sounds great, Grandma.

221
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,215
I’ve always liked tennis.

222
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,659
And I have to say, I’m excited by the prospect of getting some good, healthy exercise.

223
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:13,705
I’m excited by the prospect of those fetching tennis costumes.

224
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:15,298
Richard, not in front of Rory.

225
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:16,966
Oh, I’m fairly worldly now, Grandma.

226
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,796
She was a heck of a tennis player in her day.

227
00:09:18,844 --> 00:09:20,214
And very competitive.

228
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,359
I wasn’t that competitive.

229
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:25,823
This woman was kicked off the field hockey team in Smith for elbowing Ceci Everetts in the neck.

230
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:26,748
She got in my way.

231
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:28,864
And this happened in the parking lot after the game.

232
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,872
Now, now.

233
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,115
Rory, tell us a little more about this internship. It sounds very exciting.

234
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:36,850
Well, all I really know is that I’m going to be shadowing Mitchum Huntzberger,

235
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:39,510
just to sort of learn and observe, plus pitching in here and there.

236
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:41,278
You are going to learn a hell of a lot.

237
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,494
It was very sweet of Logan to arrange this for you.

238
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,506
Well, actually, Mitchum Huntzberger offered it to me himself.

239
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:47,275
Really?

240
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,519
Now, how about that?

241
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:49,627
He just called you up?

242
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:52,154
Your reputation for excellence preceded you?

243
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:56,196
Well, he came by Yale, actually.
I had met him when I had dinner at his house, and then -

244
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:56,993
Dinner? What dinner?

245
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:59,308
Um, just a dinner that Logan took me to.

246
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,429
At the Huntzbergers’ house?

247
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,636
Well, yes.

248
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:02,478
When? When?

249
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,146
About a week ago, I guess.

250
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:04,856
Good Lord.

251
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:06,026
Richard, it’s already been a week!

252
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:07,321
We need to invite him right away!

253
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:07,831
Who?

254
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,350
Logan! The ball’s been dropped!

255
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:11,438
I’ll put an invite in the mail first thing tomorrow.

256
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,834
We really should have had him over first.

257
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:14,113
We probably should call him as well.

258
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:16,379
We could messenger it in by tonight, it isn’t even eight.

259
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:18,570
Well, it’s really nice of you to want to have him over,

260
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:19,814
really, but you don’t need to.

261
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:23,696
Rory, if you could mention it to him yourself, preferably tonight, I’ll get a note over to him tomorrow.

262
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:24,891
He’ll need a choice of dates.

263
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:25,824
I’ll get my book.

264
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:27,181
I’ll get mine, too.

265
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,085
Rory!

266
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:31,645
Mm!

267
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:33,089
Oh, call him now!

268
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:34,545
Right now, right now, right now.

269
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:35,267
Oh, okay!

270
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:40,866
Hello?

271
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:43,976
Listen. You’re going to be getting a note from the Gilmores sometime soon.

272
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:46,353
Maybe in the mail, maybe hand delivered tonight.

273
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:49,079
For all I know, a carrier pigeon is heading for your room as we speak.

274
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,221
You might want to open your window.

275
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,927
Why is a carrier pigeon heading here?

276
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,470
They want to have you over for dinner.

277
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:54,815
Oh!

278
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,109
They’re flipping out about it.

279
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:59,654
She’s sending an apology for being so remiss as to wait one whole week

280
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:02,291
since I had dinner at your house to extend an invitation.

281
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:03,374
I mean, they’re losing it.

282
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,088
So I’m calling to warn you, and, I want you to know,

283
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:09,657
I didn’t suggest us having dinner with them or encourage it in any way.

284
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:15,321
And I definitely did not refer to you as my b-word in front of them or even imply it in any way.

285
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,341
Because, you know, I’m really happy with the way things have been going

286
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:19,761
and I don’t want any pressure put on us,

287
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:22,537
and I’m sorry,
and I think I already said that, and that’s it.

288
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,091
What are the odds of getting out of this?

289
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:25,062
Pretty much zero.

290
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:25,921
Then let’s do it.

291
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:26,565
Really?

292
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:27,847
Yeah, it won’t be so bad.

293
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,262
Well, you are a true gentleman.

294
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,316
Oh, my God, what was that?

295
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,002
Carrier pigeon. Should have opened the window.

296
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:35,935
Not funny.

297
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:36,919
Kinda funny.

298
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,201
Bye.

299
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:43,939
Burger rare, cheddar cheese, barbecue sauce on the side.

300
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,592
Oh, hey, save Rory some lemon pie.

301
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:46,538
Rory’s coming in tonight?

302
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:49,518
Yeah, she’s going to see Lane’s band play at Positively Four Street tonight.

303
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:51,016
They have the coveted three in the morning slot.

304
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,435
I hear that’s how Zeppelin started.

305
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:56,068
Yeah, her genius plan is to come home, go to bed early, set the clock for two,

306
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,051
get up and go rock.

307
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:58,084
Solid plan.

308
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,915
Yes, except that when the clock goes off at two, she will be dead asleep and won’t hear it.

309
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:03,122
I, however, will.

310
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,629
I will then proceed to get up,

311
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:09,346
drag myself downstairs, recreating a classic Zucker Brothers moment and then I’ll shake her awake.

312
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:13,736
She’ll get up, throw on some jeans, a t-shirt, and no make-up and look like a Neutrogena ad,

313
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,882
whereas once she leaves,

314
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,926
I’ll pass out on the couch, too exhausted to make it all the way upstairs,

315
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,536
and in the morning I will have bags under my eyes that should have Tumi stamped on them.

316
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:24,014
I love being a mom.

317
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:30,321
Aw. Are the guys in town unusually lonely these days?

318
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:32,885
No, they’re from the museum. I think they’re getting ready to close it.

319
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,491
Close it? No! Why?

320
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:37,102
Oh, well, you know, no one was going.

321
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:37,525
I was going.

322
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,521
Oh, well, you went once.

323
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:39,728
No, I was going to go again!

324
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:42,940
Just as soon as the nightmares about the ‘I love Jesus’ mannequin subsided.

325
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,493
Well, you saw it once.

326
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:45,551
I guess.

327
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:50,791
Here’s your sweater, and I hope you’re happy, because the saleswoman called me a name. Where’s my pie?

328
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,099
Luke! Pie!

329
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:54,523
What do we think?

330
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,108
It’s great.

331
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:56,153
Huh.

332
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:56,913
No.

333
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:58,033
I thought it was light blue.

334
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,228
No, it was dark blue.

335
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:01,491
Oh. Did they have one that was light blue?

336
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:04,638
You are officially banned from ever shopping in New Haven again.

337
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,257
Well, thank God I have you to do it for me.

338
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:08,706
Hey, Luke. You’re the only one I like around here at the moment.

339
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:09,727
Right back at you.

340
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:12,452
Okay, so, other than your stylist duties,

341
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:14,306
what else is going on in the life of the young and hopeful?

342
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:15,775
I’m considering taking Russian.

343
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:17,406
Oh, very practical. How’s Logan?

344
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,792
He’s fine. Grandma and Grandpa invited him to dinner.

345
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:20,352
You’re kidding.

346
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:24,398
It was actually less of an invite and more of a freak-out. They heard about the dinner I went to.

347
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:25,107
Heard how much?

348
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:26,336
The Reader’s Digest version.

349
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:26,809
Got it.

350
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:30,182
Apparently they’ve already exceeded the polite reciprocal invite window,

351
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:32,846
and if he doesn’t come to dinner soon, Grandma has to give back her pearls.

352
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,739
Wow. So, um,

353
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,143
when is this dinner happening?

354
00:13:36,204 --> 00:13:37,660
Three dates were proposed.

355
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:38,843
Logan’s picking one of them.

356
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:41,231
Huh. So it should be an interesting evening.

357
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:43,385
Yep. I’ll take notes and pictures.

358
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,767
Cool, okay. You do that.

359
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:47,726
I want to go to dinner.

360
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:48,348
Where’s the clock?

361
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,896
I mean, you said that I could meet Logan properly, and you know how good I am when there’s food involved!

362
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,056
Twelve thirty!

363
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:54,768
I mean, is there a reason I wasn’t invited?

364
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:57,121
Ah. Can’t we talk about this tomorrow?

365
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,054
It is tomorrow.

366
00:13:58,092 --> 00:14:00,718
I just don’t think it’s right that they get first dibs on him. I mean,

367
00:14:00,728 --> 00:14:04,674
I am your mom, and we are very close, in case you haven’t heard, and I should get to know him first!

368
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:06,853
Grandma and Grandpa already know him!

369
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:09,140
Huh! Okay, so they have a head start!

370
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:13,459
Fine. But I bet they won’t know him, know him like I will know him if you let me go to dinner.

371
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,214
I didn’t think you’d want to come to dinner.

372
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:15,870
Why not?

373
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,720
Well, it’s at their house, first of all,

374
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:21,856
and I don’t know how you feel about the Logan situation.

375
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:25,304
Hey, this guy is in your life and I want to know him.

376
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:26,735
Don’t you want me to know him?

377
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,337
Of course I want you to know him.

378
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:29,669
Okay, so -

379
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:31,623
I’d love for you to come to dinner.

380
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:34,138
Great! Good. You call Grandma for me.

381
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:35,532
No way!

382
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:36,154
Why not?

383
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:38,541
You want to come to dinner, you call Grandma!

384
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,109
But I’m not talking to Grandma.

385
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,287
Well, you’re going to have to talk to her if you come to dinner!

386
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:43,010
No, I won’t.

387
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:43,806
Mom!

388
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:45,720
No. I am there to talk to Logan.

389
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,679
To get to know him.

390
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:50,600
I mean, other than the fact that he’s blond, rich and straight, I’m out.

391
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:52,975
You’re not going to come to dinner and ignore Grandma.

392
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,626
I will not be ignoring her. I just don’t think I’ll get to her.

393
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,012
What?

394
00:14:56,323 --> 00:15:00,127
Well, I’ve heard through the grapevine that Logan is so chatty that once you get him started there’s no shutting him up.

395
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:01,652
Mom, forget it. If you want to go,

396
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:04,328
then you are going to have to call Grandma and tell her that you’re going!

397
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:04,552
But -

398
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:06,469
Now, I have to get up in two hours!

399
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:07,842
So, if you don’t mind, beat it!

400
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:08,129
But -

401
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:09,187
Hey! Sleeping!

402
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,407
Mom!

403
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:14,104
Sorry!

404
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:24,755
Can I help you?

405
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:28,203
I was just trying to figure out if I’m in the right place.

406
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:30,929
Were you hoping to be in some sort of newspaper office?

407
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:34,471
Yes, I was. I’m Rory Gilmore, I’m an intern.

408
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:37,272
Mitchum, uh, Mr. Huntzberger, hired me

409
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,357
For nothing, of course, because an intern makes nothing and they’re happy to do it

410
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:41,166
I’m new.

411
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,987
Here’s a temporary I.D. Sometime today, stop by and see Al Carson. He’ll take a picture and give you a permanent one.

412
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:49,240
I’ve never had a picture I.D. before!

413
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,954
I’ll take very good care of it. Is there a fine if you lose it?

414
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:52,535
No fine.

415
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:54,651
Well, I still won’t lose it. I promise.

416
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:57,116
Okay, you need to go see Harry, he deals with interns.

417
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:59,518
Good morning, Eagle Gazette. Please hold.

418
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,136
Good morning, Eagle Gazette.

419
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:02,452
Uh, where do I find Harry?

420
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:05,327
I’m sorry, Mr. Wallace won’t be in until this afternoon.

421
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:06,472
Uh-huh.

422
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:13,661
Harry?

423
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,022
Harry!

424
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:18,353
Who called Harry?

425
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:20,519
I did! I called Harry!

426
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,710
Hi! I’m Rory Gilmore.

427
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,216
Um, I’m an intern,

428
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,411
I have I.D.,

429
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:25,784
and -

430
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,689
Okay. This is basically the newsroom.

431
00:16:27,697 --> 00:16:30,759
Reporters, support staff over there, the composing room where we do paste-up.

432
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,514
It’s called paste-up because it used to be done with -

433
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:33,186
Scissors and paste!

434
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:36,050
Right, but now we do it on a Mac. In that cabinet are all our back-issues.

435
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,370
’95 to present are on CD-ROM, earlier on microfiche.

436
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,013
If you use the microreader, make sure you turn it off,

437
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:42,768
because the bulb is too hot and melts the stuff.

438
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,399
Boy, I sure wish I had a pencil.

439
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:48,615
This is Tom Firth’s desk. He writes Firth Things First on the op-ed. That’s Ed Rose,

440
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:51,005
circulation, advertising.

441
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:53,246
In case of fire, stairs are that way.

442
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:55,022
This is the kitchen.

443
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:58,196
Coffee, stale donuts. If you finish a pot, you make a new one.

444
00:16:58,246 --> 00:16:58,706
Harry!

445
00:16:58,769 --> 00:16:59,478
Be right back.

446
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:28,812
Huntzberger’s here.

447
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:31,289
Huntzberger’s here.

448
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:31,774
Where?

449
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:33,319
He’s one of those guys there.

450
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:34,962
Yeah, in the middle. Striped tie.

451
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,958
You know Huntzberger?

452
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:36,344
Yes.

453
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:37,303
Really? What’s he like?

454
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,207
Um, Episcopalian.

455
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,958
Second of four children, oldest boy.

456
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:43,673
And um, hates peas.

457
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:45,814
This is Stan Mercer, circulation.

458
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,482
Les Cavanaugh, city beat.

459
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:50,046
Miss Stephanie Fitz-Simmons, photo editor.

460
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:54,835
And this is Patel Kandrasaskar. He’s our resident computer whiz.

461
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:57,385
Okay. Lot of people, lot of names,

462
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,511
and I promise I’ll learn some of them.

463
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,590
We’ll talk more about this at the general meeting,

464
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:05,910
but I want you people to understand that the Huntzberger Publishing Group isn’t going to change what you do.

465
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:07,823
We’re going to help you do what you do better.

466
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:11,608
All right, I want to get all the department heads gathered in the conference room in ten minutes.

467
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:12,688
Someone make some coffee.

468
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:13,323
Rory?

469
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:14,159
Yes sir?

470
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,215
You ready to shadow me?

471
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:16,136
Yes, sir!

472
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,119
Let’s go.

473
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,869
Did you see where they went?

474
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,218
Hello?

475
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:39,658
Hello?

476
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:42,739
Who are you looking for? Did you dial the wrong number?

477
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:48,783
You know, it’s very rude to dial someone and then just sit there on the phone without so much as a grunt or a moan.

478
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:52,891
I mean, as far as perverted phone calls go, this is a very poor one.

479
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:55,393
Mom, hello.

480
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:56,349
Lorelai?

481
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:57,531
Is Rory okay?

482
00:18:57,656 --> 00:18:58,776
Yeah, Rory’s fine.

483
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:00,046
Did somebody die? Who died?

484
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:01,823
Nobody died, Mom. Everyone we know is fine.

485
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:02,682
Then why are you calling?

486
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,487
Well, I was wondering -

487
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:05,993
Yes.

488
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:10,498
I just wanted to give you a heads up that I was thinking I might come to Friday night dinner.

489
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:12,826
Mom, hello?

490
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:14,514
When?

491
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:16,543
Um, Friday night?

492
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:17,589
This Friday night?

493
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:18,909
Yes.

494
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:20,984
The night that Logan Huntzberger is coming to dinner.

495
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,216
I guess. Sure.

496
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:25,204
Well, that’s quite a coincidence, isn’t it?

497
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,913
That Logan’s coming to dinner the night that you’re suddenly free.

498
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:29,959
Well, I guess so.

499
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:32,282
Do you really think that it’s going to work this way?

500
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:32,879
What way?

501
00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:38,020
That you just check the itinerary and pick which Friday night dinners you’ll deign to come to, and which ones you won’t?

502
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,423
I am not picking. It just happened that this Friday I -

503
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:43,842
Did you wait ‘till we have a guest like the Pope for dinner and then say, oh, yes,

504
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:46,929
well, now it’s worth my while to have dinner with my family, I get to meet the Pope.

505
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:47,912
You’re Protestant, Mom.

506
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,900
You do not get to cherry-pick which Friday night dinners you attend.

507
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,200
It does not work that way. It’s never worked that way.

508
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,358
I wasn’t cherry-picking.

509
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:56,910
If you come to this dinner, you come to them all. That’s the deal.

510
00:19:56,942 --> 00:20:01,212
Well, I’m really not sure that I’m free every Friday night from now through eternity.

511
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:04,797
If you come to this dinner then you come to them all. That’s the deal.

512
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:08,043
As I said before, I’m just not sure about my schedule -

513
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,300
Well, I’ll tell you what.

514
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:11,403
You go check that schedule of yours.

515
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:15,709
If you show up on Friday night, the night that Logan Huntzberger happens to be here,

516
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:20,051
then I’ll assume that you’ve discovered that your Fridays, at least for the foreseeable future, are free.

517
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:20,960
Good-bye.

518
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:26,806
I’m saying it’s these little costs that’s having you drop your hard correspondents.

519
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:28,649
How much are you paying for syndicated features?

520
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:31,313
You run Dear Abby, and Ann Landers, and Ask Vicky.

521
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:35,828
How many different ways do the people in this community need to hear ‘honey, he ain’t going to change, dump his ass. ’?

522
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:38,604
I’d like to get that physical plant tour in before five.

523
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:41,240
Uh hang on, I'll be call mister Huntzberger is ready for you.

524
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:45,457
Well, if we’re in a holding pattern, why don’t you start getting into those circulation issues?

525
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:50,772
Wow.

526
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:56,159
The ability to run a four minute mile would come in pretty handy right about now, huh?

527
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:56,757
Sorry?

528
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,338
A four minute mile?

529
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:00,015
I don’t follow.

530
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,849
At Yale. Uh, track and field. You ran a four minute mile.

531
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:05,106
Oh. Right.

532
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,315
That’s fast. Four minute mile, whoosh!

533
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,642
Dan’s going to need another ten.

534
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:13,082
Why don’t I take you into Ron Stone’s, we’ll talk some advertising.

535
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,593
Let’s do it.

536
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,537
If you’re looking for Huntzberger, he went in there.

537
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:23,968
Oh, thanks.

538
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:38,159
Hello?

539
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,242
Help, help, help!

540
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:40,265
What’s the matter, Ace?

541
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,095
Nothing! I’ve just won the Spaz of the Year award. I believe it’ll be on the front page of the Gazette tomorrow.

542
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:46,501
Oh, I’m sure it’s not that bad.

543
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:49,423
I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I don’t know where anybody is.

544
00:21:49,473 --> 00:21:54,166
I can’t walk in these shoes. I got a run in my pantyhose. I ran into a file cabinet.

545
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:55,038
Slow down!

546
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:57,823
I didn’t even know if I was supposed to go to lunch when everybody went to lunch,

547
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:00,761
so I just stood in the break room for, like, forty-five minutes!

548
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:02,043
And then I ate an Altoid.

549
00:22:02,077 --> 00:22:03,882
It’s the first day. It’ll get better.

550
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,812
Your father must think I’m an idiot.

551
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:06,857
I’m sure he doesn’t.

552
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:09,694
I need some help. I need something to say to him other than,

553
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:11,163
‘yes, the bleeding stopped, thanks’.

554
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,743
Hey, I think that’s pretty good.

555
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:14,782
Logan, please. Give me something.

556
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:16,860
Something I can use to connect with him.

557
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,429
I don’t know!

558
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:21,327
You do know. This is important to me, Logan. Please?

559
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:27,361
He likes jazz, but not when it gets too experimental, and he hates when they quote My Favorite Things.

560
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:27,872
What?

561
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,727
My Favorite Things, from the Sound of Music.

562
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:32,998
Okay. Good. Go on.

563
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:35,909
Uh, he lets people go at seven,

564
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:39,693
but he keeps going ‘till eight thirty or nine, and he notices the people who stay.

565
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:43,638
He hates double talk, but he’s really good at it.

566
00:22:43,672 --> 00:22:48,377
And, uh, he has high blood pressure so he switches to decaf after four.

567
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:50,530
That’s good. That’s almost something.

568
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,796
Don’t worry, Ace, I’m sure you’re doing fine.

569
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:55,482
I just don’t want your father to be disappointed in me.

570
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:56,451
Rory,

571
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:00,658
in order for my dad to be truly disappointed in you, your name would have to be Logan.

572
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:01,866
I’m sure that’s not true.

573
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:02,525
Uh-huh.

574
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:03,583
Thanks, Logan.

575
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:04,766
Go get ‘em, Ace.

576
00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:13,636
Oh my God, this smells good. What is this?

577
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:17,442
It’s nothing. Just some soft-shelled crab amandine on a bed of wild rice.

578
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:22,994
Okay. There is no sentence in the English language that begins with ‘it’s nothing’ and contains the word amandine.

579
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:24,482
Happy.

580
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:27,955
Oh, my God, your girlfriend is so important.

581
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:29,648
Hello?

582
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,470
Lorelai.

583
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:31,167
Hey, Dad.

584
00:23:31,254 --> 00:23:33,607
Something very remarkable happened today.

585
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:37,873
I got a call from someone wanting to know if I was Lorelai Gilmore’s father.

586
00:23:37,973 --> 00:23:38,720
Really?

587
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:42,738
Outside the context of trouble at school, that’s the first time anyone’s ever asked me that.

588
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,481
And why did someone ask you that?

589
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:47,378
Well, one of our clients is the Durham Group.

590
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:48,026
Do you know them?

591
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,507
They, um, own hotels?

592
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:51,074
They own boutique inns.

593
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:55,232
The CEO, Mike Armstrong, is good friends with Twee Silverman,

594
00:23:55,354 --> 00:23:57,283
who is the publisher of American Travel.

595
00:23:57,818 --> 00:24:02,636
It seems there’s quite an article coming out about you and Sookie and your success at the Dragonfly.

596
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:05,545
According to Twee, it’s the cover story of the May issue.

597
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:10,425
The article’s coming out! Uh, Dad, did your guy happen to talk about what’s in the article?

598
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,543
I don’t think he read it.

599
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:15,987
Twee clued him in because she knows he’s always looking for up-and-comers.

600
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:18,422
Apparently, you are an up-and-comer.

601
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:19,281
I’m an up-and-comer!

602
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:20,824
Long story short, Lorelai,

603
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:23,563
Mike Armstrong would like to take a meeting with you.

604
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:24,120
Why?

605
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:25,738
Well, he’s in the inn business.

606
00:24:25,788 --> 00:24:27,730
I assume he wants to offer you some sort of job.

607
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,430
Dad, I have a job. Apparently you can read all about it in May.

608
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:32,049
He asked if you traveled much.

609
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,639
He wants to know where I go on vacation?

610
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:35,245
Well, he was referring to business travel.

611
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:37,162
Perhaps the position involves travel.

612
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:39,204
Do you travel? I wasn’t really sure.

613
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:41,901
Well, the liquor store is a little further out than I’d like, but -

614
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:42,549
Lorelai.

615
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,640
Yeah, Dad. I travel. Sometimes.

616
00:24:44,677 --> 00:24:45,536
Well, good!

617
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:50,165
I’ll have my secretary fax the contact information to your home fax tonight and you can call him in the morning.

618
00:24:50,203 --> 00:24:52,120
Dad, I don’t have a home fax.

619
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:55,104
I don’t see how you can do business on this level and not have a home fax.

620
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:57,095
Yeah, we’re all confounded by that, yes.

621
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:58,527
Call my office in the morning.

622
00:24:58,938 --> 00:25:01,947
I’m quite proud of you, Lorelai.

623
00:25:02,158 --> 00:25:03,241
Thanks, Dad.

624
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:06,030
They’re running the article!

625
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:08,588
Good, I’m glad that they’re running the article. I never liked that you pulled it.

626
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:14,142
Yes, well, if you recall, I pulled it only after I suggested my mother might have been personally responsible for global warming!

627
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:17,265
Are you seriously worried that things might get worse between you and your mother?

628
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:17,934
Good point.

629
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,598
So what’s all this stuff about you traveling?

630
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:24,507
Oh, some guy my dad knows wants to offer me a job and apparently there’s travel involved.

631
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,378
You have a job.

632
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:27,853
I know, but companies like this would probably want to buy the inn and,

633
00:25:27,878 --> 00:25:30,753
I don’t know, keep me on to manage it, or send me out as a consultant.

634
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:32,107
Buy the inn, you just opened the inn!

635
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:32,493
I know.

636
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,626
You don’t want to sell the inn!

637
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:34,149
I know!

638
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:36,838
I mean, who are these people, coming in from out of the blue with this stuff?

639
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:39,971
I don’t know. It’s just some guy who called my dad and wants to meet me.

640
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:41,116
Well, this is crazy.

641
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:42,623
You don’t want to meet with this guy.

642
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:44,811
Luke, I’m not interested, so it doesn’t matter.

643
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:47,437
I have no intention of meeting with this guy. I’m happy with what I’ve got.

644
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:47,935
Good.

645
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:53,731
You know what?

646
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,482
You should meet with this guy.

647
00:25:56,582 --> 00:25:58,620
My daughter, my sister, my daughter, my sister, my daughter -

648
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:00,665
I’m serious. Even if you’re not interested, I mean,

649
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:03,674
it’s good people are talking about you and your business.

650
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:06,251
I mean, just take the meeting. It’s -

651
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:09,460
it’s contacts. It’s networking. Right? That’s the right word, networking?

652
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,058
I think.

653
00:26:10,145 --> 00:26:11,253
Well, then you should network.

654
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:13,117
All right. Well, I’ll think about it.

655
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,511
Good, good.

656
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,556
Good.

657
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:20,088
Beatrice.

658
00:26:20,197 --> 00:26:20,795
Yes, ma’am.

659
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:21,940
Do you know what these are?

660
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:22,736
Lilies.

661
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:23,720
Fragrant lilies.

662
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,209
Would you like to eat dinner with fragrant lilies in the room?

663
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:26,629
Yes.

664
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:27,961
Well, then you’re insane!

665
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:34,223
I don’t know how you think my guests are supposed to enjoy their dinner with this floral reek wafting up their noses!

666
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,497
Move them to the living room and bring the peonies in here.

667
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:37,904
Yes, ma’am. Sorry, ma’am.

668
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,447
Everything looks lovely.

669
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:40,269
Does it?

670
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,049
Yes, and so do you.

671
00:26:42,543 --> 00:26:44,086
What’s on the dinner menu tonight?

672
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:44,808
Roast beef.

673
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:45,617
Oh,

674
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:47,846
I hope Logan’s not some kind of vegetarian.

675
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:51,278
Well, his grandfather owned ten thousand head of cattle. I sincerely doubt it.

676
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,917
You know, I’ve just been thinking.

677
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:57,738
The Huntzbergers will all be transferring down to Martha’s Vineyard soon.

678
00:26:57,785 --> 00:27:00,897
Mid-June, every year. I’m sure Logan’s there for some of that.

679
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:02,553
They have six acres there.

680
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,586
It’s quite a spread.

681
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,442
They’ve held their share of functions down there, too. Graduations, parties, weddings.

682
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:08,948
Maybe it’s time for us, Emily.

683
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,645
Time for what?

684
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:11,002
Time to acquire an acreage.

685
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:13,253
A compound for the extended family.

686
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:14,460
A place on Cape Cod!

687
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:16,014
Our own Kennebunkport.

688
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:17,744
Get it all ready for the next generation.

689
00:27:17,781 --> 00:27:19,512
The Cape’s as good as the Vineyard for a wedding.

690
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:20,507
Or some would say better.

691
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:21,740
Sandier beaches, too.

692
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:25,919
Children love sandy beaches. Just love running and playing on them.

693
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:29,305
Oh, damn. I forgot to fill the ice bucket.

694
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:30,882
Go get, it. I’ll get the door.

695
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:33,198
Richard!

696
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:37,555
Picture his blond hair and her blue eyes on a little baby!

697
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:38,933
Incomparable!

698
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:46,800
Hi, Mom.

699
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:48,351
Oh. Come in.

700
00:27:48,712 --> 00:27:49,446
Thanks.

701
00:27:51,488 --> 00:27:53,081
Beatrice, take my daughter’s coat!

702
00:27:55,322 --> 00:27:55,857
Thank you.

703
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:05,663
What are you doing here?

704
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,122
I don’t know, I just followed you.

705
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:10,388
Richard, come out here and sit with Lorelai.

706
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,396
Coming!

707
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,139
Mom, it’s okay. I can sit by myself.

708
00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:14,708
You need me to sit with Lorelai?

709
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:17,903
I’m fine. I swear. I have been sitting without any help since I was two and a half.

710
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:20,019
No, that’s all right. I don’t mind. Come along.

711
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:23,729
Please, sit. Sit.

712
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,092
There’s a lot of pressure to do it right now.

713
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:27,735
So, did you ring Mike Armstrong?

714
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:29,811
I did. We have a meeting set up for tomorrow.

715
00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:31,404
Oh, good. Good, I’m glad.

716
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,010
Mike is very big in that business.

717
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:34,330
I think you’ll find him a valuable -

718
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:35,151
Richard!

719
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:36,542
I need help in here!

720
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:39,131
I’m sitting with Lorelai, Emily!

721
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:40,301
Dad, really. It’s okay.

722
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:42,729
I promise not to stick my finger in any sockets.

723
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:43,566
Well, all right.

724
00:28:44,462 --> 00:28:45,371
Here I come.

725
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:50,325
What sort of help do you need, my dear?

726
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:59,040
You know, you’re not obligated to be polite until we’re actually inside my grandparents’ house.

727
00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:02,709
Good. Allow me to use these brief moments of time to make disgusting noises with my armpits.

728
00:29:02,747 --> 00:29:04,514
Oh, would you? So,

729
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:06,454
this is going to be quick and painless.

730
00:29:06,503 --> 00:29:09,354
Believe me, my grandparents like you better than they liked Ronald Reagan.

731
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:10,673
Wow. High praise.

732
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:11,495
What are those?

733
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,770
Hostess gifts. Never a bad idea to bring hostess gifts.

734
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,165
Well played, Huntzberger!

735
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,494
So what about your mom? She going to be cool?

736
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:17,814
Of course she’ll be cool.

737
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:19,656
She’s the essence of cool

738
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:20,913
Cool’s her street name.

739
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:23,129
She’s got it monogrammed on her towels and everything.

740
00:29:23,188 --> 00:29:26,200
Well, if she’s got it monogrammed on her towels, there’s nothing to worry about.

741
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,333
What’d you bring, anyway?

742
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:31,901
Cigars for Richard, chocolates for Emily, and Mrs. Eleanor Shubick’s silver lighter.

743
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,018
Huh? What’s that for?

744
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:36,018
Rory! Logan, welcome!

745
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:36,890
Come in, come in!

746
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:37,749
Hi, Grandma!

747
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:38,769
Hello!

748
00:29:38,865 --> 00:29:39,997
And our guest of honor.

749
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:41,217
L’invité d’honneur.

750
00:29:41,242 --> 00:29:42,761
How are you, Richard? Emily?

751
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:43,794
Wonderful, now.

752
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:44,914
Yes, wonderful.

753
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:47,824
Oh, look at you two, you’re just perfect. Aren’t they perfect, Richard?

754
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:48,322
Perfect.

755
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:49,343
We’re not perfect.

756
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:50,525
Nonsense, you’re perfect!

757
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,616
No, she’s right. I’ve got split ends like you wouldn’t believe.

758
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:54,533
And a sense of humor.

759
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:57,057
Emily, these are for you. A small token of my gratitude.

760
00:29:57,094 --> 00:30:00,045
Vunderschen chocolates, I absolutely adore these!

761
00:30:00,144 --> 00:30:01,688
I picked them up last time I was in Switzerland.

762
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:03,007
Well, aren’t you clever.

763
00:30:03,128 --> 00:30:04,323
And here’s a little something for you, sir.

764
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:05,767
Oh, Romeo y Julietas.

765
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,859
You are a good man, Logan Huntzberger!

766
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:10,796
Come on, let’s all go in the living room, shall we?

767
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:15,250
I just adore this jacket you’re wearing. Isn’t this a fine jacket, Richard?

768
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:18,323
Oh, I like how the lapels are cut. Aren’t those nice lapels, Rory?

769
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:20,461
Uh, sure, Grandpa. His lapels look great.

770
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:22,602
Most modern tailors cut lapels too low.

771
00:30:22,813 --> 00:30:27,706
It’s so sloppy, having one’s lapels hang down around the chest like a basset hound’s ears or something.

772
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:28,922
But those are excellent.

773
00:30:28,947 --> 00:30:29,955
Oh, they really are.

774
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,752
Hi, Mom.

775
00:30:30,802 --> 00:30:32,146
Hey, how am I sitting?

776
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,839
Great. Mom, you remember -

777
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:37,682
Logan, this is Rory’s mother, Lorelai. Lorelai, this is Logan Huntzberger.

778
00:30:37,707 --> 00:30:40,022
Yes, we’ve met, actually. Nice to see you again, Logan.

779
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:40,879
Nice to see you.

780
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,306
Come on, sit, sit, sit. Let’s get drink orders.

781
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:43,929
Mm.

782
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,107
Logan, what will you like?

783
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,464
McKellen neat, if you have it.

784
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,837
Oh, I adore a man who drinks his scotch neat.

785
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:51,617
That is a fine drink indeed.

786
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:52,389
Rory?

787
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,721
Just club soda.

788
00:30:53,845 --> 00:30:55,488
So demure. Isn’t she demure?

789
00:30:55,526 --> 00:30:56,335
The demurest.

790
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,318
One club soda.

791
00:30:58,351 --> 00:31:00,479
And your usual, Lorelai? A sidecar?

792
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,447
Sidecar? No.

793
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:02,331
Isn’t that your drink?

794
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:05,555
No, my drink is a martini. It’s always been a martini.

795
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,165
Really?

796
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,057
Yes. Pretty much every one of the other eight thousand times I’ve had a drink here

797
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:11,028
it’s been a martini.

798
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,218
I would’ve sworn you were a sidecar girl.

799
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:14,711
Not even sure what’s in a sidecar, Mom.

800
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:17,662
Well, Richard, apparently Lorelai would like a martini.

801
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:19,019
Can do.

802
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:20,870
I just can’t get over those lapels.

803
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,044
Grandma and Grandpa are very taken with Logan’s lapels.

804
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:25,301
They look fine to me.

805
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:30,139
You’ll have to excuse Lorelai, Logan. It takes a certain eye to be aware of this kind of thing.

806
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,766
One scotch neat, and a club soda.

807
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:33,227
Thank you.

808
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:33,886
Thanks, Grandpa.

809
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:35,803
And one martini.

810
00:31:36,086 --> 00:31:37,443
That’s with a twist, Lorelai?

811
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:38,563
Nope. An olive.

812
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:39,807
In a vodka martini?

813
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:41,090
Not vodka, Mom.

814
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:44,587
Gin. It’s always been gin. Gin martini.

815
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:45,245
Really?

816
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:46,552
Yes! Always!

817
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,033
I don’t remember that at all.

818
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:51,830
Uh, so. Logan. Where exactly do you live at Yale? Are you in Rory’s building?

819
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,798
No, I’m at Berkeley.

820
00:31:52,835 --> 00:31:53,906
Is that far from Rory?

821
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,708
No, I’d say it’s about ninety Kropogs or so.

822
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:59,306
Kropogs! Did somebody say Kropogs?

823
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:01,880
Kropogs. Now that is clever.

824
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,042
Uh, fill me in here. What’s a Kropog?

825
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:09,271
Years ago, someone at Yale started measuring things based on the height of a kid named Kropog.

826
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:13,761
I can’t believe that today’s Elis are still using Kropogs. Now that is really something.

827
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,882
Maxwell T. Kropog was his name, class of forty-four.

828
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:21,267
Oh, Lorelai, I’m sorry. I forgot your drink. I made it and everything.

829
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:23,008
Well, you remembered now.

830
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:24,452
No, Richard, stay, I’ll get it.

831
00:32:25,507 --> 00:32:29,490
I’m glad to hear that Kropog is still part of the Yale vernacular.

832
00:32:29,627 --> 00:32:30,773
Tradition is so important.

833
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:33,100
Why don’t we talk about something other than Yale?

834
00:32:33,135 --> 00:32:37,131
Nonsense, there’s nothing better to talk about than Yale. Because Yale men are the greatest.

835
00:32:37,452 --> 00:32:42,444
I dated a few Princeton men and a Harvard man back in my day, and they had nothing on Yale men.

836
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:43,352
They’d better not.

837
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:44,435
Here you go, Lorelai.

838
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:48,601
Mom, there’s an onion in here.

839
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:49,709
Is that not what you wanted?

840
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,203
Olive. I said olive.

841
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,446
Well, I heard onion.

842
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:53,479
Well, I said olive.

843
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:55,832
Let me get you an olive.

844
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:04,891
And the racquets have changed too. Honestly, the people at the club must have thought I was there to play badminton when I showed up with my old wooden thing.

845
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:08,287
Oh, you have to get a new racquet, Emily. The materials available today make all the difference.

846
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,643
I told her the same thing.

847
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:14,520
I know this guy, he’s one of the top manufacturers of ceramic racquets. Pete Sampras loves them. I could totally set you up.

848
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:16,785
Did you hear that, Richard? Logan can set me up!

849
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:17,943
Well, how about that!

850
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,486
Dinner is ready, Mrs. Gilmore.

851
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:20,803
Well, shall we?

852
00:33:21,263 --> 00:33:24,960
I’m just going to pop into the kitchen to check on a thing or two. Richard, will you come carve the roast?

853
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:25,645
Certainly.

854
00:33:25,782 --> 00:33:27,350
Is there going to be alcohol with dinner, Mom?

855
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:27,923
What?

856
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:32,773
You know, booze? ‘Cause I haven’t been able to get even a Kropog of gin since that first drink.

857
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:35,985
A Kropog is a unit of distance, Lorelai. Not volume.

858
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:39,691
And there’ll be wine with the meal. There’s always wine with the meal, Lorelai!

859
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:42,069
Honestly! You’re acting as if you’ve never been here.

860
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:44,605
Sorry.

861
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:46,484
Just wasn’t sure.

862
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:53,503
Roast. Sounds good.

863
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:55,407
It does.

864
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:56,503
Yeah.

865
00:33:57,832 --> 00:33:59,550
Who doesn’t like a good roast?

866
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:07,735
What are you doing?

867
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:12,466
A little Life and Death Brigade business. Every time we’re in a rich person’s house we take a knick-knack.

868
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,018
Then I leave the knick-knack I took from the last rich person’s house. I’ve been doing this up and down the eastern seaboard for years.

869
00:34:17,043 --> 00:34:17,790
Logan, no.

870
00:34:17,803 --> 00:34:19,222
Trust me. They never notice.

871
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:20,168
You’re crazy!

872
00:34:20,218 --> 00:34:21,437
It’s fun to be crazy.

873
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,613
Grandma probably wants us here.

874
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:31,092
All right, the salads will be out in just a moment. Everybody, sit.

875
00:34:33,256 --> 00:34:34,115
Wait a minute.

876
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,717
What’s wrong, Emily?

877
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,345
Well, I don’t know.

878
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:42,092
Wait. My antique sewing box! It’s missing!

879
00:34:42,152 --> 00:34:43,459
Well, that can’t be.

880
00:34:43,484 --> 00:34:45,450
It is! It’s gone! Was it here during drinks?

881
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:47,206
Well, I can’t say that I noticed.

882
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,468
You, hovering there! What do you know about this?

883
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:49,953
Ma’am?

884
00:34:50,028 --> 00:34:52,368
My antique sewing box. Did you move it somewhere?

885
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:52,791
No.

886
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:53,884
And yet it’s not here.

887
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:56,623
Do you have any explanation as to why it’s not here, Beatrice?

888
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:58,241
I’m sure it’s just a mix-up, Mom.

889
00:34:58,278 --> 00:34:58,664
And -

890
00:34:59,424 --> 00:35:00,058
what’s this?

891
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:02,059
What’s this lighter?

892
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,051
Richard, is this from the pool house?

893
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,856
Well, I don’t recognize it, but,

894
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:08,906
well, you never know. One of the guys might have left it after a poker game.

895
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:11,206
Well, Beatrice. I don’t know what to say.

896
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:15,015
I almost feel like I should go through the whole house and make sure nothing else has been misplaced.

897
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:16,183
Mom, I found it.

898
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:18,610
However, we have company and I don’t want to be rude.

899
00:35:18,856 --> 00:35:22,454
Let’s just leave it for later and then you and I will have a very serious discussion.

900
00:35:22,877 --> 00:35:24,134
Mom, I found it!

901
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:24,720
What?

902
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:26,110
Yeah, here it is.

903
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:26,783
Really?

904
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,002
Where was it?

905
00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:29,210
Behind the centerpiece.

906
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:30,729
I guess the flowers kind of hid it.

907
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:32,832
Behind the centerpiece?

908
00:35:33,226 --> 00:35:34,571
What on earth are you smiling about?

909
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:35,952
I’m just glad you found it.

910
00:35:36,002 --> 00:35:38,168
Would you please go into the kitchen and bring out the salad course?

911
00:35:38,629 --> 00:35:40,583
Rory, Logan, I’m so sorry.

912
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:42,584
Well, never a dull moment, as we say.

913
00:35:42,621 --> 00:35:45,671
Ah, here we are. Avocado salad with beet dressing.

914
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:48,372
Oh, wonderful. I’m starving.

915
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:55,196
Believe me, Rory’s the real star at the Yale Daily News. People hate her.

916
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:56,179
They hate you?

917
00:35:56,217 --> 00:35:57,910
I’m not hated. Am I hated?

918
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,797
She’s had more pieces printed above the fold this year than anyone.

919
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:03,090
Well, you are both enormously talented.

920
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:07,472
Because if you have one tenth of your father’s ability, young man, you are going to go straight to the top.

921
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,238
A power couple. That’s what you are.

922
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:12,746
We were thrilled to hear that Rory is going to be working with your father, Logan.

923
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,447
I’m not really working with him. Just near him, more like.

924
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,457
She’s knocking them dead over there. Now if I can just get her to relax.

925
00:36:18,532 --> 00:36:19,291
I relax.

926
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:22,737
Speaking of relaxation, does your family still have their place on Martha’s Vineyard?

927
00:36:22,774 --> 00:36:25,998
I think they bought it from Martha. They’re not giving that up. It’s not going anywhere.

928
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:27,352
It’s lovely in the vineyard.

929
00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:32,817
A few years ago, Richard and I attended a wedding there. I thought there could be no more gorgeous a spot for a wedding.

930
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:33,676
It’s beautiful.

931
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,189
But then we went to one on Cape Cod

932
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:37,919
and it was wonderful too.

933
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:40,542
Either place would be good for a wedding, don’t you think?

934
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:42,446
Sure, I’ve been to weddings at the Cape myself.

935
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:43,529
So you like Cape Cod?

936
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:44,077
Yes.

937
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:44,908
We like Cape Cod.

938
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:45,371
Mm.

939
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:46,118
Great.

940
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:48,132
And I know Rory would like Cape Cod.

941
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,639
I like what I’ve seen in pictures.

942
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:51,954
You two would look awfully cute in Cape Cod.

943
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:55,151
Mom, did you get a job at the Cape Cod chamber of commerce?

944
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:55,849
No.

945
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,821
There are a lot of kids in your family, aren’t there?

946
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,020
Yeah. The extended family’s been pretty busy procreating lately.

947
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:03,287
They have, have they?

948
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:04,146
Do you like kids?

949
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:04,744
Sure.

950
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,935
Kids love Cape Cod.

951
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:09,783
I think internships are a Communist plot.

952
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:10,417
What?

953
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:12,483
Forcing someone to work without pay?

954
00:37:12,508 --> 00:37:13,815
It’s a little Pinko, isn’t it?

955
00:37:13,876 --> 00:37:16,216
I mean, where’s Roy Cohn when you need him?

956
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:17,371
Have you lost your mind?

957
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,035
No, no. It’s still sloshing around up there.

958
00:37:20,943 --> 00:37:22,114
Would you like another apple, Rory?

959
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:24,476
Oh, no thanks. They were really good, though.

960
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:25,796
How about you, Logan? Apple?

961
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,613
Thank you, but I don’t think I could eat another thing,

962
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:31,157
and unfortunately we should be going. I have an early day tomorrow.

963
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:33,373
Oh, Logan, an early day. I’m so sorry we kept you.

964
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:34,518
I wish I could stay longer.

965
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:36,719
An early day is an early day. Beatrice, get their coats.

966
00:37:36,744 --> 00:37:38,898
I had a wonderful time. Thank you so much.

967
00:37:38,947 --> 00:37:41,325
Yes, thank you, Grandma and Grandpa. It was great.

968
00:37:41,387 --> 00:37:43,155
Of course. We had a wonderful time too.

969
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:43,575
Bye, Mom.

970
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,517
Bye, hon. Goodnight, Logan.

971
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,276
Nice to see you again.

972
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:47,956
Nice seeing you again, too. I hope we can all do this -

973
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:50,322
Lorelai, don’t keep them. Logan has an early day tomorrow.

974
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:51,131
Sorry.

975
00:37:51,277 --> 00:37:53,891
Now, I’m going to hold you to your promise about that tennis racquet.

976
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:56,766
Oh, absolutely. I’ll call you this week, or maybe I’ll just shoot you an e-mail.

977
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,692
Shoot me an e-mail. That is so clever.

978
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,205
That’s good business sense, too.

979
00:38:01,255 --> 00:38:04,305
You have to utilize the latest technology or you’ll fall behind.

980
00:38:05,388 --> 00:38:07,018
Now, would you look at that!

981
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:10,090
What a cunning little car! I adore sports coupes.

982
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,721
Fine parking job, too.

983
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:13,302
Well, good bye, Grandma and Grandpa.

984
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:14,161
Thanks again.

985
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,389
Good night, you two. Drive safe!

986
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,838
More coffee, Lorelai?

987
00:38:22,137 --> 00:38:23,394
No. Thank you.

988
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:26,839
What?

989
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:30,623
Um, nothing. Just on those National Geographic shows,

990
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:34,017
people are so sweaty after a mating ritual. But you two are powder dry.

991
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,523
What on earth are you talking about?

992
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:38,324
They’re just kids, and they’re still figuring things out,

993
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:44,235
and they don’t need you two dropping all these heavy-handed hints about weddings and babies and Cape Cod.

994
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,347
You should be thrilled by this match, Lorelai.

995
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:47,455
Well, who says I’m not thrilled?

996
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:49,061
Well, you’re not acting very thrilled.

997
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:51,127
I’m annoyed at you. That’s why.

998
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:54,662
Putting all this pressure on them? They are in their early twenties, for God’s sake.

999
00:38:54,696 --> 00:38:56,389
You are letting your own personal tastes

1000
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:57,982
cloud your judgment of this boy.

1001
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:59,949
He is perfect for Rory, and you don’t see it!

1002
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:01,741
This is not about my personal taste!

1003
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,855
You’re uncomfortable around people like Logan.

1004
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:04,938
He’s not your type.

1005
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,996
That’s well documented.

1006
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:08,274
Oh, that was a nice not-so-subtle dig at Luke.

1007
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:08,834
Luke?

1008
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:10,101
Who said anything about Luke?

1009
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:11,408
You’re very sensitive tonight.

1010
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:15,924
I’m not sensitive. It’s just you’re busy marrying Rory off into a family that wasn’t even nice to her!

1011
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:17,107
Who wasn’t nice to her?

1012
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:18,153
The Huntzbergers.

1013
00:39:18,178 --> 00:39:21,239
She went over there for dinner and they treated her like trash.

1014
00:39:21,286 --> 00:39:22,743
I highly doubt that.

1015
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:23,552
Well, they did!

1016
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:25,967
If the Huntzbergers were so horrible to Rory,

1017
00:39:26,014 --> 00:39:29,001
why on earth did Mitchum give her a very valuable internship?

1018
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:30,533
He was buying her off.

1019
00:39:30,582 --> 00:39:32,225
So, the internship was like hush money?

1020
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:32,797
Yes!

1021
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:34,986
There’s no money! It’s an unpaid position!

1022
00:39:35,011 --> 00:39:36,156
It’s a figure of speech.

1023
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,743
Rory got this internship by making a contact.

1024
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:41,693
In a way, similar to me setting you up with Mike Armstrong.

1025
00:39:41,743 --> 00:39:42,801
Is there something wrong with that?

1026
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:43,449
No.

1027
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,292
I concur.

1028
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:46,308
There is still something wrong with this internship.

1029
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,863
My God, you’re paranoid.

1030
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:49,108
I am not paranoid!

1031
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,361
And Logan did not have an early day!

1032
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:51,897
What?

1033
00:39:51,981 --> 00:39:55,168
What twenty-two year old has an early day on a Saturday?

1034
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:57,819
Why are you so hell-bent on derailing this match?

1035
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,348
They’re perfect for each other!

1036
00:39:59,385 --> 00:40:01,589
Okay, that word, perfect, he is not.

1037
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:04,078
I mean, no one is, okay, but especially him!

1038
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:08,008
I mean, at your wedding, I caught him and Rory in the back room

1039
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,349
uh, kissing.

1040
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:14,740
Kissing.

1041
00:40:15,027 --> 00:40:16,520
You have something against kissing?

1042
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:18,037
I never thought of you as a prude.

1043
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:19,245
Paranoid, not a prude.

1044
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,614
He stole your sewing box.

1045
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:23,923
The sewing box is sitting on the table in the living room, Lorelai.

1046
00:40:23,947 --> 00:40:25,030
No, no. He’s just a -

1047
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:25,739
Are we done here?

1048
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:26,299
No!

1049
00:40:26,322 --> 00:40:27,579
Good. I have a call to make.

1050
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,085
You might want that cup of coffee.

1051
00:40:29,147 --> 00:40:31,313
Clear your head a bit before you drive home.

1052
00:40:31,337 --> 00:40:34,026
Or maybe you’ve just had one too many sidecars.

1053
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:42,673
So it’s not necessarily a diminishment of personnel.

1054
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:45,661
No, that’s the advantage of using crewed reporting through the whole syndicate.

1055
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:48,273
By sharing the resources, you’re going to have more options.

1056
00:40:48,336 --> 00:40:50,763
With more options, you’re going to be less reliant on the wire services.

1057
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:54,706
People will only read so many flatly written wire stories before they

1058
00:40:54,742 --> 00:40:57,966
catch on and start reading something else, or worse, turn on the T.V.

1059
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,588
Coffee?

1060
00:40:59,272 --> 00:40:59,991
Uh -

1061
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:00,928
It’s decaf.

1062
00:41:01,622 --> 00:41:02,158
Oh.

1063
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:03,714
Well, thank you.

1064
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,062
It’s good. All right,

1065
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,487
let’s take a look at that editorial budget.

1066
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,163
What are you waiting for, Gilmore, an engraved invitation?

1067
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:21,887
Good!

1068
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:22,784
Very good!

1069
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:23,817
I’d say it’s a nine.

1070
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:24,626
Nine plus.

1071
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,908
What would make it a ten?

1072
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:26,842
Another half a point.

1073
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:29,206
Lemon juice and a handful of parsley.

1074
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:30,476
Yes. A tart fresh taste.

1075
00:41:30,526 --> 00:41:33,127
Manny, try a little lemon juice and parsley!

1076
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:33,775
Okay!

1077
00:41:33,812 --> 00:41:35,044
How long are you going to have him working here?

1078
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:36,002
Well,

1079
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:40,620
with that fancy pants article coming out about us, I want to make sure that the food stays top-notch.

1080
00:41:40,677 --> 00:41:42,246
You know, Mike Armstrong called again.

1081
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:42,930
Really?

1082
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:44,860
That’s the second time since the meeting, isn’t it?

1083
00:41:44,897 --> 00:41:46,777
Yeah. He’s, like, open to any option.

1084
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,756
Buying the inn, or just investing in the inn -

1085
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:49,789
We’d have money again.

1086
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:51,195
Remember what it was like to have money?

1087
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:52,661
He’d be keeping us on to run it.

1088
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:56,843
We could consult. We could travel around the world telling other people how to run their inns -

1089
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:59,619
We could be bossy. Oh, we could travel and be bossy!

1090
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:01,362
He mentioned the south of France.

1091
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:05,343
Apparently they’re making a huge investment there and they have a need for people like us.

1092
00:42:05,378 --> 00:42:07,992
I can picture us in the south of France, oh, topless!

1093
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:08,651
At work?

1094
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:09,734
No. We’re on the beach.

1095
00:42:09,756 --> 00:42:10,777
Much more appropriate.

1096
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:12,992
And the casinos, oh, and the cheese!

1097
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:17,436
You know, my dad traveled all over the world for work, which drove my mom crazy, which was a little perk.

1098
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:18,743
But he would always say things like

1099
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:20,833
‘I’ll be back from Düsseldorf on Friday’.

1100
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:24,702
And when I was a kid, I always wanted to say ‘I’ll be back from Düsseldorf on Friday’!

1101
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:26,308
Oh, that would be great.

1102
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:29,180
To get into all those famous kitchens I’ve always read about.

1103
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:32,329
We’d have expense accounts and travel luggage. It’d be exciting, huh?

1104
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:33,723
Yeah, it would!

1105
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:37,046
But, I can’t do that.

1106
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:40,902
I have Davey and little No-name here, and Jackson.

1107
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:43,517
Jackson wouldn’t want to go topless in France.

1108
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:43,915
Yeah.

1109
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:45,418
My life is here.

1110
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,301
Yeah, sure.

1111
00:42:46,426 --> 00:42:47,422
But you could go.

1112
00:42:47,596 --> 00:42:48,082
What?

1113
00:42:48,256 --> 00:42:51,393
Your kid’s in college. You’re young. You love to travel.

1114
00:42:51,428 --> 00:42:53,047
You look amazing topless.

1115
00:42:53,221 --> 00:42:54,802
You could go.

1116
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,442
I mean, what’s stopping you?

1117
00:42:56,903 --> 00:42:57,426
Well -

1118
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:58,745
Oh! Snap peas!

1119
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:00,849
Snap peas would be good in this!

1120
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:03,027
Manny, snap peas!

1121
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:03,412
Snap peas.

1122
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,091
Snap peas. Yeah.
