00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:08,230
Hi.

2
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:10,036
Hey. Haven't started yet.

3
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:11,275
Oh, good. Sorry I'm late.

4
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:13,246
I found Paul Anka hiding underneath
the kitchen sink,

5
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:15,127
chewing on one of my favorite pairs of shoes.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,582
Boy, that guy's career has
really hit the skids.

7
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:22,775
Okay, that is officially my last "Paul Anka,
the person, is living in your house" joke.

8
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:24,608
Hello, everybody! Thank you all for coming!

9
00:00:24,654 --> 00:00:27,134
We have a packed agenda tonight,
so why don't we get started.

10
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:31,381
First off, a little update on the
improvements to the post office buil--

11
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:33,244
What be this?

12
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:34,692
A gathering of some kind.

13
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,788
Be it safe, or shall I raise my musket?

14
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:40,564
Patience, brother. Despite the disturbing
sight of women in pantaloons.

15
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,979
Ugh, I hope this isn't an
audience-participation thing.

16
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:45,332
Excuse me.
But we're in the middle of something here.

17
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:46,683
Who are you?

18
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:47,891
- It's Kirk!
- Shush!

19
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,603
I'm Phineas, and this is my brother Zebediah.

20
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:54,301
We have come a long way
through space and time.

21
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:55,999
We hail from Stars Hollow.

22
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:58,365
I, a silversmith, and he, a simple cobbler.

23
00:00:58,424 --> 00:00:59,412
With good rates.

24
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:02,737
I will cobble a...
cobbled thing for a ha'penny.

25
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:04,328
Does Kirk know what a cobbler is?

26
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,064
I'm guessing "no."

27
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:08,387
But I know all the denizens of Stars Hollow.
I don't recognize you.

28
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:09,720
It's Kirk and Andrew!

29
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,041
- Gypsy.
- It is!

30
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:13,060
And we do not recognize you.

31
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:17,119
As residents of the year 1779,
all looks foreign to us.

32
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:19,922
Who's gonna tell them those
outfits are so 1778?

33
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:24,137
Well, you have so journed from the very
year of Stars Hollow's founding!

34
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:27,955
I pray, good sirs,
do you still find our fair town pleasing?

35
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,669
Yes, but much has changed.

36
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:33,281
Samuel Munson's apothecary is gone and,
with it, his leeches.

37
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:36,612
And old Clay's Gambling Hall,
where we did frolic with wenches.

38
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:38,489
We're without leeches and wenches.

39
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,765
And, most disorienting, the street names.

40
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,025
They're all so different.

41
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:45,722
We were looking for Blacksmith's
Road and found Peach Street.

42
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:49,134
And for Longman's Leap,
but found Second Avenue.

43
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:51,452
That must be very confusing.

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,282
Pray, tell me, how may we ease your passage?

45
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,082
If the town were to return
to its old street names,

46
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,258
we would more easily find our way.

47
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,815
"The old street names," you say.

48
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:06,453
Gentlemen, do take seats while I
confer with my contemporaries.

49
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:07,497
Who are you fooling?

50
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:09,532
You're wearing tube socks.

51
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:15,948
Ladies and gentlemen, our tourism revenue
is off 26% from the previous fiscal year.

52
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,113
In that same time,
Woodbury and Cogsville's revenue has jumped.

53
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:24,558
That's because they are highlighting their
heritage, thus, increasing their charm.

54
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:28,666
The more charm a town has,
the greater its tourism revenue.

55
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,899
We've got charm.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,397
Yeah, you wouldn't believe the bikini waxes
Lisa's doing at the beauty parlor.

57
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,973
Any shape you can imagine.

58
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:38,256
So clever... and charming.

59
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:41,073
But not historically charming,

60
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,117
which is why I'm proposing
changing our street names

61
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:47,186
back to what they were at
Stars Hollow's founding.

62
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,977
Isn't that gonna cost a lot of money?

63
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,885
Yeah, Taylor, you hate spending money.

64
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:53,064
This is an investment in our future.

65
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,692
I'll have to buy new business cards.

66
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:55,880
I think it would be kind of cool.

67
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:56,923
- Really?
- Yeah.

68
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,034
I like old-timy stuff.
The Dragonfly's on third street,
which is kind of boring.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,602
Well, thank you, Lorelai,
for your sound opinion.

70
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:04,459
I think it's one of my better ideas.

71
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:08,143
I agree. It's not like the time
you guaranteed the tourists
a mosquito-free summer,

72
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,485
and then released hundreds
of bats all over town.

73
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:11,625
Oh, that was a stinker.

74
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:15,340
How about when he was trying to attract
families to visit the town by driving his van

75
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:18,415
around other towns and beckoning
kids with candy?

76
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:20,185
- That was dumb.
- Really dumb.

77
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,203
So we're saying this is a good idea?

78
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:24,274
That is what we're saying.

79
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:26,108
Let's put it to a vote, then. Shall we?

80
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,074
All those in favor, raise hands.

81
00:03:28,162 --> 00:03:32,050
Excellent. The matter is passed.
And we shall change our street names.

82
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:34,249
Now, our next order of business--

83
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:38,147
What about when he had us re-enact
the Boston tea party in the lake?

84
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:39,622
What a disaster.

85
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:42,112
We're still paying off the EPA. fines.

86
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,499
Folks, please.

87
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:47,051
What about the Museum of Rocks
that look like famous people?

88
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,406
Ooh, that's my favorite!

89
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:47,538
Here you go. Scooped bagel,
cream cheese, jam.

90
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,492
Thank you. Did you save the scoopings?

91
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,449
I love you!

92
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,479
So, what's going on in the world?

93
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:53,559
- Nothing...
- Nothing?

94
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,638
Good. Nothing good.

95
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,833
There's absolutely nothing positive going on
anywhere in the world. How could that be?

96
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,130
That's why I don't read the paper anymore.

97
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:01,489
You will mine. I am starting my own.

98
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,847
The Good News Daily-- nothing
but good news every day.

99
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:04,517
Sounds good.

100
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:06,903
"No civil war in Canada"-- big article.

101
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,606
"Cars drive down road without
incident"-- front-page news.

102
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:13,200
"Puppies-- how cute are
they?" In-depth expos�.

103
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:15,098
And the subscription is free.
How happy is that?

104
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:16,453
I'm in a better mood.

105
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:18,090
What are you hanging out here for?

106
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,963
Ugh. Ouch. What happened to the love?

107
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:22,083
You know what I mean.
You're usually at the Inn by now.

108
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:24,646
Well, new street names are being posted
today. I'm waiting for Sookie and Michel.

109
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:26,644
We're gonna see what name the Dragonfly got.

110
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,302
Wanna come with?
Want to see what name you got?

111
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:30,364
I'll wait to read about it
in the Good News Daily.

112
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:32,687
All right. It's another dumb Taylor thing.
Sorry.

113
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,109
You may now lower your blood pressure.

114
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:36,407
That's not why I'm not going.
I just don't have the time.

115
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:38,555
I think changing the street
names is a fine idea.

116
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:39,251
You're kidding.

117
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:41,928
No, change them all.
Name them after cartoon characters.

118
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,502
I'll be on Scooby-Doo Lane.

119
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:44,556
It's all the same to me.

120
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:45,570
Where's this coming from?

121
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,744
It's taken me a ridiculous amount of years,

122
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,544
but when it comes to Taylor,
I've adopted a zen attitude.

123
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,328
Zen?

124
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:56,840
Go with the flow.
Let the river Taylor take you where it may.
Don't fight it. Just let it happen.

125
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:59,581
What if he wants to paint the diner pink
for Easter like he did last year?

126
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,264
Then let the building be pink.

127
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:04,555
What if he decides we should dress up as
our favorite tree again for Arbor Day?

128
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:07,163
Wrap me in bark,
fill me with sap and tell me where to stand.

129
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:10,719
What if he wants to photoshop a picture
of you with your arm around him

130
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:13,118
and slap it on a billboard that
overlooks the whole town?

131
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:14,644
- The river zen...
- Sitting on his lap.

132
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,577
- ...will keep on flowing.
- Holding a rattle.

133
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:17,596
Let me keep my zen.

134
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:19,436
I'm gonna miss nuclear Luke.

135
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:21,970
Hey.

136
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:22,768
Hi!

137
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:26,134
We just passed Esther Wilkins.
She got Constabulary Road.

138
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,332
Constabulary Road-- how cool is that?

139
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,881
Very. I'll be done here in a minute.

140
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:32,094
Do you have coffee?

141
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:34,566
You mean, here at my coffee shop?
Let me think.

142
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:35,240
Yeah.

143
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:36,249
Give it.

144
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:38,168
You're gonna need zen for him, too.

145
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:40,975
This is very early for me to get up.

146
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,663
You'll survive, big guy.

147
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:45,453
I'm not at my best if I don't
get my model's 12.

148
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,579
Well, you hide it beautifully.

149
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:50,675
The key is absinthium with gingko extract.

150
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,649
Like you're washing your face
in a bowl of diamonds.

151
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,017
A bowl of diamonds-- doesn't
that cut up your face?

152
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:58,575
Ugh. I need my coffee.

153
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:08,710
Does your grapefruit taste strange to you?

154
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,137
What?

155
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:12,286
The grapefruit-- is it unnaturally sweet?

156
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:13,559
It tastes like grapefruit, Emily.

157
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:16,553
There's sugar on it. I can taste it.
Consuela put sugar on it.

158
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:17,908
If you say.

159
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:20,933
That girl puts sugar on everything,
like yesterday's salmon.

160
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:23,598
Fish is not supposed to be caramelized.

161
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:24,989
I didn't notice.

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,344
Don't defend her, Richard.

163
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:27,843
I'm not defending her, Emily.

164
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,873
It starts with the grapefruit.
Next, it'll be the berries, the melons.

165
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:33,703
Pretty soon,
everything in this house will be candied.

166
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:36,582
Rory, breakfast is ready.

167
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:38,737
Rory, are you there?

168
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,013
Rory?

169
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:42,384
Good morning, grandma.

170
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,082
You're not still sleeping, are you?

171
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:44,975
No.

172
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,570
You're missing Katie Couric.

173
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:47,997
I don't watch Katie Couric.

174
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:51,410
Oh. I thought you watched Katie Couric.
I heard you mention her once.

175
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:56,326
Grandma, did you find someone to fix
the intercom yet? It's stuck
at this one volume-- loud.

176
00:07:56,388 --> 00:08:00,899
I've been looking and looking, but
the company that made it went
out of business in 1973--

177
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,107
the Binzer Corp.

178
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,086
Arthur Godfrey was their spokesman.

179
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,666
Who?

180
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:09,045
He was sort of the Katie Couric of his day.
We'll get the intercom fixed, I promise.

181
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:11,669
- Good.
- So, go ahead and pour you some coffee?

182
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:12,959
I'll be right in.

183
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,774
I'm signing off. 10-4.

184
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:15,901
10-4.

185
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,561
Isn't that a pretty picture?

186
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:21,762
The prettiest.

187
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:23,846
That outfit matched her face.

188
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:26,266
You'll get extra copies for us, right?

189
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:28,654
I'll have my secretary get them.

190
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:32,629
So, have you seen Logan around lately?

191
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:34,154
I don't know if it was lately.

192
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,183
That makes me nervous.

193
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,524
He's busy, too.

194
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:38,304
I hope that's it. Not something else.

195
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:39,568
What else would it be?

196
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:41,322
Oh, that talk I had with Shira.

197
00:08:41,378 --> 00:08:43,900
I hoped our understanding was
clear about those two.

198
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,353
That we were going to let them be.

199
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:47,093
Maybe I was just being naive.

200
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:50,106
Richard, are you listening to me?

201
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:51,053
Yes, Emily.

202
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:53,784
Just because you haven't seen the
boy doesn't mean anything.

203
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:55,811
Our hours are different from theirs.

204
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:57,616
Consuela!

205
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:00,767
Consuela?

206
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:05,961
She's probably in the backyard,
harvesting sugarcane.

207
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,199
Maybe Consuela and Logan
have run off together.

208
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,356
Not funny.

209
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:12,443
Thank you.

210
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,797
Logan's probably out of town.

211
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,407
Or busy with school.

212
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:20,929
All I know is, I haven't seen him. And Rory
is lying in bed till 8:30 every morning.

213
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:24,025
That could be some sort of
young woman's melancholia.

214
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:25,596
Something from your office.

215
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,509
Why I had to fetch it, I don't know.

216
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:30,053
I'll remind Consuela it's a part of her job,

217
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:32,557
assuming she hasn't left
us to go work full time

218
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:35,413
for that giant sugar consortium
that sent her here.

219
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,371
What's that?

220
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,350
Just an insurance claim from the Dragonfly.

221
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:40,781
A claim? What sort of claim?

222
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:42,530
They had a small fire there last week.

223
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:43,539
They had a fire?!

224
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,408
Don't get excited.

225
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,179
- Is Lorelai okay?
- She's fine.

226
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:47,901
- Did you talk to her?
- I talked to her.

227
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,130
You talked to her.

228
00:09:49,263 --> 00:09:51,091
Yes, Emily. She had a small fire.

229
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:52,359
Well, how did she sound?

230
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:54,118
Just like she'd had a small fire.

231
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,554
It was a very quick face-to-face,
and then I left.

232
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:58,293
Face-to-face? You saw her face-to-face?

233
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,711
Well I had to go over there.

234
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:00,989
Why did you have to go there?

235
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:03,501
Because, Emily, she'd just had a small fire.

236
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:04,555
How did she look?

237
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:05,727
Fine.

238
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,839
Was she thin, heavy? Did she look tired?
What was she wearing?

239
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:12,762
Is she still on that netherworld of "I don't
know what my hair is supposed to be"?

240
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:14,096
She looked just like Lorelai.

241
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:18,302
It was a very brief conversation-- not
like the one you and I are having.

242
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,558
You should have told me, Richard.

243
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:25,868
And this grapefruit is definitely sugared.

244
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:32,229
I hope it's something like "Calla Lily Lane."

245
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:33,897
Like a flower-- something pretty.

246
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:37,533
Or Charing Cross Road,
or Abbey Road-- something classy.

247
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:40,005
Can we walk a little faster, please?

248
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:41,105
Michel's still pouting?

249
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:42,024
I'm not pouting.

250
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:43,335
So your botox has worn off?

251
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:44,385
It has not.

252
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,944
And I'm not pouting.

253
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,550
Then get with the spirit.

254
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:49,255
This is a workout.
You're being paid for this.

255
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:52,835
So it takes the three of us to stare
at a stupid piece of cardboard?

256
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:56,341
Maybe later we can all gang
up on that light bulb.

257
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,176
All right, let's see here.

258
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,652
I'm so excited. It's like Spanish class
when everyone gets a Spanish name.

259
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:02,403
What were you?

260
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:04,814
"Sookia." I don't think it's
a real Spanish name.

261
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,115
I think they just added an "a" at the end.

262
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,858
Okay, let's see. Where are we?

263
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,148
There. Right there.

264
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,478
That is the lake, Sookie.

265
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,204
If we were there, we would all have drowned.

266
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:16,658
We are at the bottom.

267
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,478
No, I think we're off to the right.

268
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:20,330
Or... off to the left.

269
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:21,686
Wait. Where's north?

270
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:23,871
Everything's rotated 90 degrees.

271
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:27,078
This map's completely wackadoodle.
I can't find-- ohh.

272
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,301
Oh, no.

273
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:29,723
Oh, no!

274
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,100
Oh, no.

275
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,183
Oh, no.

276
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:35,976
Yeah.

277
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:39,613
No, I understand. Taylor's a very busy man,
but it's just a quick question.

278
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:42,918
Lorelai Gilmore.

279
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,426
You know me, Joey.

280
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:46,448
You cleaned out my rain gutters last year.

281
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,559
Yes, I paid you. I most definitely paid you.

282
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:50,536
It's got to be a mistake.

283
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:51,861
Got to be a mistake.

284
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:54,260
"Sores and Boils Alley."

285
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:55,005
Stop saying that.

286
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:59,248
We are on Sores and Boils Alley.

287
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,174
What kind of menu do you serve
on Sores and Boils Alley, huh?

288
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,750
Anything in a crust.

289
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:06,191
Try in the storage room, Joey.

290
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:08,461
Yes I know it's creepy in there,
but I really need to speak to him.

291
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,616
Why couldn't it be something
that didn't ooze or run?

292
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:12,225
Like a wart or a bunion?

293
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,727
Bunions are okay.

294
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:16,439
They're sort of onions mixed with buns.

295
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,196
That's sort of appetizing if
you don't think too hard.

296
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:20,890
You know what this means, don't you?

297
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:21,795
It means nothing.

298
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:24,590
It means my next review will be in the
New-England journal of medicine.

299
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:25,767
I want you to both chill out.

300
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:27,904
I will fix this just as soon as
I get Taylor on the phone.

301
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:31,128
Okay.
Maybe if we come up with a catchy phrase,
something funny,

302
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,768
so it seems like we're in on the joke,
like we're aware, ironic, and hip.

303
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:36,796
Like what?

304
00:12:36,863 --> 00:12:40,219
What catchy phrase using the
words "Sores" and "Boils"

305
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,848
will make it seem like we're in on the joke?

306
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:43,483
Delivery.

307
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:44,346
I'll sign for it.

308
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:45,831
Don't get hostile with me.

309
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,699
You are a silly woman.

310
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,530
I am not silly. You're silly.

311
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:51,874
Hey, I want you both to cut it out.

312
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,740
Now I am going to fix this.

313
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,234
I mean,
the whole idea behind this street-name thing

314
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,193
was to improve tourism, you know,
not destroy it. So...

315
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,095
Sookie, did you order this?

316
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:04,918
Nope.

317
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,646
Michel?

318
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:09,887
Yeah, right,
like I'm going to buy an analog clock.
Do I look 205?

319
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:13,730
Well, apparently, it's for me,
but I didn't order a clock.

320
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:16,083
Uh, yes, I'm still here.

321
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,649
Okay, just tell him I called.

322
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,771
You didn't find Taylor?

323
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:20,677
Don't worry-- I will.

324
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:23,484
I'm going to go add a few select
things to my resumé.

325
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,570
Michel!

326
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,164
I will find him, Sookie. Don't cry.

327
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:29,041
White sauce looks like pus.

328
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:30,091
Go in the kitchen, Sookie.

329
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:32,771
Salsa verde looks like infection.

330
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:33,973
Kitchen-- go.

331
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,459
Wow, you made good time.

332
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:49,491
Silly rabbit. Speed limits are for kids.

333
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:51,164
Hey, you went shopping?

334
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:52,376
Actually, I did.

335
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:53,900
- For me?
- For you.

336
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:56,376
Wow. What's the occasion?

337
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:58,009
Where's it written I need an occasion?

338
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,381
Wow, you did it.
You bought me the head of Alfredo Garcia.

339
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:02,762
Open it, ace.

340
00:14:03,614 --> 00:14:05,305
Wow, cool-- a bag.

341
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:07,172
- Look inside.
- Okay.

342
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,647
Wow, cool-- a bag.

343
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:10,630
You like it?

344
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:12,236
Hello? I'm a girl. It's a purse.

345
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:14,226
Not just a purse. It's a Birkin bag.

346
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,150
I went to school with a guy named Birkin.

347
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:17,778
I don't think this is the same Birkin.

348
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:18,704
Oh.

349
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:20,571
Well, it's beautiful.

350
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:23,697
I mean, it's snazzy and classy. And, oh,
smell it.

351
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,352
It's got that new-car smell,
except it's not a car.

352
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:30,241
Oh, I love it, Logan. I love it.
Thank you so much.

353
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:34,313
You're welcome. Sorry, there's not another
bag inside the bag inside the
bag inside the box inside the bag.

354
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:38,989
It's great. You know, I think my computer
cords would fit in this perfectly.

355
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,613
Ah, this is not a computer
cord kind of purse, ace.

356
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:44,913
Why don't you just call my sister?
She'll fill you in. It's like a thing,
you know?

357
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,444
Oh. It's a thing.

358
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,644
A beautiful, leather, grownup thing.

359
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,687
So, are you ready to go?

360
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,935
Uh, yeah.

361
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:57,889
Let's go.

362
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,964
Come on, Taylor, answer.

363
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,537
Taylor's ye olde soda shoppe.
How can I help ye?

364
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:08,861
Taylor, it's Lorelai.
I've been trying to reach you all day.

365
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:11,641
Lorelai. Oh. Well, Joey mentioned that.

366
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,696
He also mentioned something about not
being paid for some rain gutters
he cleaned. That's not cool.

367
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:20,881
Look, Taylor, do you, by any chance,
know what street name the Dragonfly got?

368
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,391
Of course-- Sores and Boils Alley.

369
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,512
So you knew about it.

370
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:25,244
Absolutely.

371
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,650
- Sores and Boils.
- That's right.

372
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:28,984
- Sores and Boils.
- Yes, indeed.

373
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:30,815
I'd kill to have that name.

374
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:33,076
- Quite frankly, you're a lucky woman.
- How?

375
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:37,419
Sores and Boils Alley is one of the most
historical places in all Stars Hollow.

376
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:40,387
In the 18th century,
if you had a sore or a boil,

377
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:43,374
you came to Stars Hollow to have it lanced...

378
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:46,654
- Yeah, but--
- ...to the very site of your establishment.

379
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:50,881
Word is,
they also had a leper colony in your garage.

380
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:53,541
I'm trying to verify that. If we do,
you get a plaque.

381
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:55,233
Okay, Taylor, look--

382
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:59,485
Truth is, this town wouldn't
be here without your street.

383
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,612
Sores and boils may seem minor to us now,

384
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:07,396
as we sit here with our sea breeze astringent
and our pond's cold cream,

385
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,577
but time was they were the
scourge with no cure.

386
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,956
And where was that noble work done?

387
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:16,025
Where were the sick cured and
the suffering put at ease?

388
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:19,586
I'll tell you where-- on
Sores and Boils Alley.

389
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:23,531
In fact, I even have a valuable
collection of antique lances.

390
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:26,996
Yours for the asking-- as a loaner,
of course.

391
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:30,362
The Dragonfly can display
them in the lobby...

392
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:31,676
assuming you're bonded.

393
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:34,428
Look, the historical thing-- it's swell.

394
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,357
The boils and sores and lepers and lances--

395
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:40,163
great stuff, if you're running
a hospice in the 18th century.

396
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:42,803
But I'm running an Inn in the 21st.

397
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,576
And?

398
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,143
People come here for a beautiful, nice,
romantic time.

399
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:50,426
And part of what I slightly overcharge
them for is the ambiance.

400
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,609
Is there a point here?

401
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,446
The point is that I don't want to
have to go around advertising,
"come to historic Stars Hollow.

402
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,006
It's not as gross as it sounds."

403
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:01,544
I must say I'm very surprised at
this negativity. You were so
supportive at the meeting.

404
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:03,554
What happened-- fight with Luke?

405
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,632
Look Taylor,
I'm trying to be very zen about this.

406
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:07,391
But this name is not gonna work for me.

407
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:09,759
Well, I'm not really sure
what to do about this.

408
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,714
We could keep our old street name.

409
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:14,237
No harm, no foul,
no Lorelai pulling her hair out.

410
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:17,813
No. The whole town's changing.
That won't work at all.

411
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:22,043
But I will think about your situation
and try to come up with alternatives.

412
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,937
Great. And I'll think about it, too.

413
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:26,061
Together, I'm sure we'll
figure something out.

414
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:27,273
We can fix this.

415
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,137
All right.

416
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:28,906
Great.

417
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:30,067
Thank you, Taylor.

418
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:35,458
Did you order a birdcage?

419
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:39,295
I've never had so many compliments
about anything.

420
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:41,624
It's not the bag, ace. It's the arm it's on.

421
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:46,401
And I like swear that I'm not going to let
ballpoint pens explode in the bottom of it.

422
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:48,781
Crap. I left my cell back in the car.

423
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:49,973
Are you expecting a call?

424
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:54,076
From my dad. He's dragging me to a corporate
retreat with his editors.

425
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,933
Three days of "absolutely, Mitchum." "Great
idea, Mitchum." "Can I preach
you that food for you, Mitchum?"

426
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,775
You can suffer through three days.

427
00:17:59,832 --> 00:18:01,365
I'll meet you back at the pool house, okay?

428
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,516
Don't get lost.

429
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:06,872
Oh, Logan. I thought I heard a noise.

430
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:09,275
Richard. Yes. I was just dropping Rory off.

431
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:11,654
Oh. 10:00 on the button. Well done.

432
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,255
I didn't want to keep her out late, sir.

433
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,119
You're a responsible young man, Logan.

434
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:16,577
Say, how about a nightcap?

435
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:19,282
I have a new single malt
I'm dying to break in.

436
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:20,821
Sounds great.

437
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:26,081
Look who I found.

438
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,570
Logan. You found Logan. How are you?

439
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,850
How are you, Emily?

440
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:32,789
Logan was just dropping Rory off.

441
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:34,201
10:00 on the button.

442
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:35,531
A gentleman, this one.

443
00:18:35,577 --> 00:18:37,936
Logan, would you like some coffee,
perhaps some dessert?

444
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,112
Thanks, Emily, but I've eaten.

445
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:42,023
I thought the two of us would
grab a little nightcap.

446
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,044
Well, I'll leave you men to your drinks.

447
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:45,322
Good seeing you, Emily.

448
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,163
Please.

449
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:49,389
So... how are things, Logan?

450
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:50,321
Fine.

451
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:51,457
Good.

452
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,349
Back at school, are you?

453
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,711
For a few weeks now.

454
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:56,757
Good. Good.

455
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:58,343
Good that you're back.

456
00:18:59,726 --> 00:19:03,623
Got any classes that you're
interested in this year?

457
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,055
The semester's shaping up okay.

458
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:06,708
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

459
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:10,919
Hmm. You working at the Yale paper again?

460
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,809
Yes, sir.

461
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,620
Apple doesn't fall far from the tree,
does it?

462
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,406
Not if the tree has anything to say about it.

463
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:17,937
Yes, well... it's good to see you.

464
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:20,752
We don't get many sightings of
you young people nowadays--

465
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:23,598
the two of you ensconced back
there at the pool house.

466
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:25,085
Rory's so busy.

467
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:28,861
Her life's a total mystery to us.
She could be in the CIA. for all we know.

468
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:32,427
Well, I don't think she's joined
the CIA., sir, but I'll check
her purse for secret documents.

469
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,712
So, tell me, Logan,
what is going on with Rory?

470
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,353
Uh, yours and Rory's life.

471
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:39,319
Uh... nothing special.

472
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:41,094
No? Oh.

473
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:44,638
Well... does she have any big plans?

474
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:45,453
Plans?

475
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:49,961
Yes. I mean,
the way that girl keeps to herself,
we wouldn't know if she was moving to Peru.

476
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:52,425
Are you two planning on moving to Peru?

477
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,200
No, we're not.

478
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:57,322
Well, if not Peru,
then what is on the horizon for Rory?
And for you?

479
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:58,904
Anything different going to happen?

480
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,960
I don't... Well, we're thinking of going to
the vineyard in a few weeks. That's about it.

481
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,577
- A trip to the vineyard?
- Yes, sir.

482
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:06,194
Nothing else coming down the pike?

483
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,351
No, sir.

484
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:12,175
Hmm. Well, the vineyard is always nice.

485
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:14,947
Very brisk this time of year.

486
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:17,684
Hey, Logan.

487
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:19,468
What are you doing here? I thought you left.

488
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:20,938
I ran into Richard on the way out.

489
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:22,081
Rory, is that you?

490
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,687
Uh, yeah, grandma. It's me.

491
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,211
What are you doing here?

492
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:29,754
Well... I was just looking for some
sugar for my morning coffee.

493
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,828
Oh, please, don't get me started on sugar.

494
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:33,195
Richard and I were just catching up.

495
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:34,694
Having a little digestif.

496
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:38,077
Yes, and, Richard, the scotch was great, but
I should probably get going given the hour.

497
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,237
- Oh, of course.
- I'll walk you out.

498
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:41,950
Richard, Emily.

499
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:43,049
Good to see you, Logan.

500
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:44,293
Drive safe.

501
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:51,610
So, what were you two chatting about?

502
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:53,225
Oh, this and that.

503
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:55,645
Did it seem like everything was
fine between the two of them?

504
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:56,976
As far as I could tell.

505
00:20:57,151 --> 00:20:58,813
We're missing Charlie Rose.

506
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:08,132
What was that all about?

507
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,111
What was that about? Your grandfather
was asking about my intentions.

508
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:12,606
Your intentions toward what?

509
00:21:12,677 --> 00:21:15,127
Uh, toward you, us, marriage.

510
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:17,409
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

511
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:19,877
Suddenly I was in there and he was asking
me questions about our plans

512
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,876
and the future and the CIA. and Peru.

513
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:23,789
I don't understand. Why would he do this?

514
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,649
I don't know.

515
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,536
I'm only 20. We're young.

516
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:27,809
We just started going out.

517
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,592
Why would we even be thinking about marriage?

518
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:30,741
I don't know, ace.

519
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,778
These are all really good questions.

520
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,038
Listen, maybe we should hang
out at my place for a while

521
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:37,567
so as not to give your grandparents
a visual to lash out to.

522
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:41,483
No. Look, I'll take care of this. I promise.
Don't worry about it.

523
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:43,025
Ace, it's okay.
You don't have to do anything.

524
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:46,366
No, this is not okay. This is not cool.
I don't want them thinking this.

525
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:48,934
I don't want you feeling like
you can't come here.

526
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,159
I promise you,
I will take care of this, okay?

527
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:52,362
Okay.

528
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,177
Ugh. My cellphone's still in my car.

529
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:56,230
Oh, sorry.

530
00:21:56,253 --> 00:22:00,210
Hey, if I'm not back in five minutes,
it means I'm in the main house,
picking out china patterns with Emily.

531
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:06,770
Oh! Starved!

532
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,104
You're always starved.

533
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,204
Yes, but now, I'm "crash-landed in the Andes,
eat my teammates" starved.

534
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,632
I'll be back in an hour.

535
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:14,213
No.

536
00:22:14,217 --> 00:22:17,896
Mm-hmm. Three more packages, all for you.

537
00:22:17,994 --> 00:22:20,904
Where is all this stupid stuff coming from?

538
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:24,159
Looks like classic home shopping
channel merchandise to me.

539
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:26,231
I have not bought anything off
the home shopping channel.

540
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:27,402
That you remember.

541
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,462
How could I not remember?

542
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:31,899
You could be deluding yourself,
suppressing a shameful, costly,

543
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:35,225
and yes extremely tacky shopping
addiction from your memory.

544
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:38,422
I do not have a home shopping
channel addiction.

545
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,174
This does look familiar,
like I've seen it before.

546
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,710
Was Joan Rivers or Suzanne
Somers holding it up?

547
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:45,831
I'm not buying these things.

548
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:47,038
You keep telling yourself that.

549
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:50,701
By the way, Kirk is in the dining room,
wanting to speak to you.

550
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,155
Must be about the street name.

551
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:55,101
Can you contain your personal demons
long enough to face him,

552
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:56,713
or shall I send him away?

553
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,530
Enough, Michel.

554
00:22:57,592 --> 00:23:00,898
It's never enough. That is the problem.

555
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,663
- Lorelai, hello.
- Hello, Kirk.

556
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,866
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

557
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,205
I'm pleased to inform you that the
Stars Hollow board of tourism

558
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,562
has graciously decided to
offer you a proposal.

559
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:13,868
Great. I appreciate it.

560
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:14,854
What do you have for me?

561
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:18,999
You can choose any of three historically
anchored street names

562
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:21,899
that pre-dated Sores and Boils Alley.
It's a generous proposal.

563
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,984
Let's hear them.

564
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:25,950
The first one is Constabulary Road.

565
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:27,005
Constabulary Road.

566
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,754
It's a very nice name. Classic.

567
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:30,913
Very evocative of old-time Stars Hollow.

568
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:34,392
Yes, it's very nice, but Kirk, that's the
exact name of Esther Wilkins' Street.

569
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:36,531
I mean, the exact name. It's taken.

570
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:40,947
I know. Apparently, at one time, there were
several streets named Constabulary
Road in Stars Hollow.

571
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:42,579
Yeah, that would be incredibly confusing.

572
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:44,041
Oh, it would be a disaster.

573
00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:45,479
It was back then, too.

574
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:47,986
Mail was mis-delivered.
Soldiers lost their way.

575
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:50,302
It completely disoriented senior citizens.

576
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,969
There was rioting, chaos, death.
Everyone hated it.

577
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,813
What's number two?

578
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:57,820
Number two--
Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg.

579
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:00,506
- Chargogga-what?
- An old nipmuck Indian name.

580
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:05,418
Means "you fish on your side of the lake,
I'll fish on my side,
no one fishes in the middle."

581
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:06,717
Or maybe it means "Buffalo."

582
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:08,138
It's unpronounceable. Next.

583
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:10,630
From 1768, something flavorful.

584
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:11,601
Crusty Bulge.

585
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:12,836
Oh, come on!

586
00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:13,776
Is that a no?

587
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:17,096
Yes, that's a no.
Kirk, these are not legitimate choices.

588
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,088
- Taylor thinks they are.
- Taylor's wrong.

589
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:22,193
The Dragonfly is a business.
We need a credible street name.

590
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,997
So I tell you what we're gonna do-- we're
keeping third street.

591
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,200
Taylor is not gonna like that.

592
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:29,489
Well, too bad,
'cause that's what we're doing.
Decision made.

593
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,428
It's not gonna be Crusty Bulge.

594
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,696
It's not gonna be an Indian name
that no one can pronounce.

595
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:37,771
And it's not gonna be a name
that 50,000 other people had

596
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:40,232
that caused mass chaos and death in 1492.

597
00:24:40,283 --> 00:24:42,852
Oh, my god.
I just realized where all that stuff is from.

598
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:43,910
What? What stuff?

599
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:46,197
Never mind. Just tell Taylor what I said.

600
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:47,644
- So we're done here?
- Definitely.

601
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:50,484
Thank god. Mom tied this way too tight.

602
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:59,024
- Am I disturbing?
- No, come on in.

603
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:03,315
Rory, this is Edgar Pullings.
He installed the intercom 46 years ago.

604
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:04,631
Nice to meet you.

605
00:25:05,372 --> 00:25:06,979
She said, "nice to meet you"!

606
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,624
Oh, nice to meet you, young lady.

607
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:11,235
He calls me that, too.

608
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,128
It's right in there, Edgar!

609
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,332
Okay, I'll have a look-see.

610
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:19,522
You just holler when you're situated,
and I'll bring in your toolbox!

611
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:23,944
And if you're feeling faint or need
a glass of water, don't be shy!

612
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,033
I'm sorry for the short notice.

613
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,250
But once I found him, I figured I'd better
get him over here before he... retires.

614
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,429
No, it's great. Thank you.

615
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,406
Everything else around here up to snuff?

616
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:36,894
Are the sheets being over-ironed?

617
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:38,254
No, they're perfect.

618
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,650
'Cause that's not an urban legend.

619
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:42,540
If sheets have a high thread count,
they can be over-ironed.

620
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:45,103
Grandma, um, can I ask a favor?

621
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,220
Of course.

622
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:49,736
I was wondering if you would
speak with grandpa for me.

623
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:51,260
About what?

624
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:56,656
Well, last night,
when he had the nightcap with Logan,

625
00:25:56,907 --> 00:26:00,627
he said some things that made
Logan a little uncomfortable.

626
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:02,126
Oh no. What kind of things?

627
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:05,844
Just things about our future-- Logan's
and mine.

628
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:08,709
I think grandpa wanted to find out
if we were getting married.

629
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:09,436
What?!

630
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:12,009
The thing is, we're young.

631
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,051
And we haven't been going out for that long.

632
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:16,753
It's way too soon for us to be thinking
about getting serious.

633
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:19,679
Of course it is.
Your grandfather should know better.

634
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,352
Don't you worry. I'll clear this up with him.

635
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:23,332
- Thank you, grandma.
- My pleasure.

636
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:27,124
So, now that that's taken care of, tell me,
just between us girls,

637
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,800
how are things going between you two?

638
00:26:28,872 --> 00:26:31,517
Well... they're great.

639
00:26:31,594 --> 00:26:35,881
Logan's very nice. He bought me this terrific
gift just completely out of the blue.

640
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:36,751
Is that so?

641
00:26:36,768 --> 00:26:39,253
Totally unexpected.
It's called a "Birkin bag."

642
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:40,547
A Birkin bag?

643
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:43,008
Oh, my god.

644
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,275
A Birkin bag.

645
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:45,255
You've heard of it?

646
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:46,580
Of course.

647
00:26:46,653 --> 00:26:48,487
That's a very nice purse.

648
00:26:48,554 --> 00:26:50,697
Oh. Maybe I shouldn't use it.

649
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:53,798
Oh, no. A Birkin bag is meant to be used...
and seen.

650
00:26:53,865 --> 00:26:55,252
I had no idea.

651
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:57,292
Well, well, well.

652
00:26:57,353 --> 00:26:58,684
A Birkin bag.

653
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:00,939
A Birkin bag. A Birkin bag for Rory.

654
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:01,620
Grandma.

655
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:04,183
I'm just saying.
Richard never bought me a Birkin bag.

656
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,755
Oh, this is exciting!

657
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:06,865
I guess it is.

658
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:09,658
A Birkin bag. I'm gonna remember this day.

659
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:14,160
Um... it's been very quiet in there.

660
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:15,193
Huh?

661
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,696
Oh, dear.

662
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:17,858
Edgar?

663
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:18,902
Edgar!

664
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:19,906
Edgar!

665
00:27:22,427 --> 00:27:25,334
Oh, my god. I made it. Food, me, give.

666
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,612
Emergency BLT.

667
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:30,731
Yeah. Emergency chili fries and a
black-and-white shake. It's
a three-alarm emergency.

668
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:34,429
Something came for you early this morning.
Good old Ceaser signed for it.

669
00:27:34,496 --> 00:27:35,695
Oh, my god!

670
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:39,807
Normally, I have a blanket policy against
the diner accepting humongous 5-foot urns

671
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:45,210
addressed to other people,
but I was at the market, and Ceaser,
he apparently didn't know about the policy.

672
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:47,844
- Oh, she is good-- covering all the bases.
- Who?

673
00:27:47,896 --> 00:27:51,166
And sending it here. Brilliant.
Picking away at the people closest to me.

674
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:51,961
Who? Who is this?

675
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:52,949
Emily Gilmore.

676
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,752
You're kidding!

677
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,279
For days! She's been emptying sending me
everything she doesn't need anymore,

678
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:58,829
trying to smoke me out of my foxhole.

679
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,747
Call her and tell her to knock it off.

680
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:03,684
Oh, no. That's exactly what she wants.

681
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,099
I poke my head out of the foxhole,
it gets blown off.

682
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:07,189
Then I have no head, Luke.

683
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,317
There's a giant urn in my diner.

684
00:28:09,382 --> 00:28:12,989
It started small-- a clock, birdcage,
some Victorian figurines, an old telescope.

685
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:15,313
That was the ground war.
She was softening me up.

686
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:18,377
Now comes the aerial campaign.
The carpet bombing.

687
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:20,266
I bet she'll bomb me with actual carpets.

688
00:28:20,326 --> 00:28:20,995
Call her.

689
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:22,633
You mean, surrender? Never.

690
00:28:22,694 --> 00:28:25,983
If you don't call her,
she's gonna keep sending you stuff,
sending me stuff.

691
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:26,997
She'll run out of stuff.

692
00:28:27,064 --> 00:28:28,399
She'll buy more stuff.

693
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,371
She'll run out of money.

694
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:30,804
She's got endless money.

695
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,498
Luke, my mom has a tenth degree black
belt in passive aggression.

696
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:37,327
There is no counter to this move,
which means I am not going to counter.

697
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,855
I can't have a giant urn sitting
in my restaurant.

698
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,439
Actually, it's more of a vase.

699
00:28:41,496 --> 00:28:43,430
I don't care what it is.
The thing weighs 300 pounds.

700
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:45,271
Ceaser said it took four guys to bring it in.

701
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:47,303
You got to admit.
It does kind of spruce up the place.

702
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,951
It goes today.

703
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,107
Okay, okay, I'll work on figuring
out how to get it out of here.

704
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,550
I think it's actually one of a matching pair.

705
00:28:57,807 --> 00:28:58,538
You busy?

706
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,798
Not too.

707
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,766
I want to let you know Rory had a little talk
with me today I thought I'd share with you.

708
00:29:03,838 --> 00:29:04,923
Oh? What about?

709
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:06,826
About Logan, about something you said.

710
00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:07,951
It's been handled.

711
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:09,415
Something I said? When?

712
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,863
Don't worry. He's fine. She's fine.
They're fine. Very fine.

713
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,095
Logan bought her he most beautiful and
prestigious handbag in the world.

714
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:18,143
A handbag?

715
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,535
A Birkin bag.

716
00:29:19,622 --> 00:29:21,914
I've shown you pictures before, remember,
around my birthday?

717
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,367
So sophisticated.

718
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:26,635
Now we know our worries about Shira
messing with things were unfounded.

719
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:28,432
They are doing very well.

720
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:31,604
Yes, that's fine, Emily.
But what did I say that caused a problem?

721
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:36,029
Well, you scared the poor boy half to
death during that nightcap of yours.

722
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:36,863
How?

723
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:39,440
Your intentions speech was
so out of the blue.

724
00:29:39,508 --> 00:29:42,786
My intentions speech. I'm not following.
Intentions about what?

725
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:44,700
Really, Richard,
you're always a half step behind.

726
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:47,263
That's because you tell me
things in drips and drabs.

727
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,272
What does she think I said?

728
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,795
That you basically asked when he
was going to propose to her.

729
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,393
I asked him nothing of the sort!

730
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:55,352
We were just chatting, shooting the breeze.

731
00:29:55,423 --> 00:29:59,211
Well Logan viewed it as an interrogation
about his and Rory's future.

732
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,592
The boy misunderstood.
I wasn't talking about their future.

733
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,991
I was talking-- it was scotch talk.

734
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:08,224
I would never dream of interrogating
him like that.

735
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:10,408
I'll apologize to him the
next time I see him.

736
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,253
And to Rory.

737
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,079
- Good.
- I mean, that's ridiculous.

738
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:15,821
Those two are way too young to
be thinking about marriage.

739
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:16,959
They just met each other.

740
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:17,997
It's been over a year.

741
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:19,418
It hasn't been a year.

742
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:20,349
They're babies.

743
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:21,497
Babies?

744
00:30:21,562 --> 00:30:24,428
Richard, your granddaughter
is about to turn 21.

745
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:28,203
If they did get engaged, the ceremony
would be next year at the
earliest or the year after.

746
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,292
That makes her 23.

747
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:30,203
And too young.

748
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:32,566
It's the same age I was when we got married.
I wasn't too young.

749
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:33,886
- We were different.
- How?

750
00:30:33,938 --> 00:30:36,695
Because we're us, and Rory's Rory.
She has things to do.

751
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:39,586
I don't know why you're so worked up
about this. They aren't engaged.

752
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:40,282
Good.

753
00:30:40,348 --> 00:30:41,607
What was your talk with Logan about?

754
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:44,754
I was just curious about what
was going on with Rory.

755
00:30:44,824 --> 00:30:46,497
She can be extremely taciturn.

756
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:47,746
What are you so curious about?

757
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:49,967
The girl spends all her time
in that pool house.

758
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,690
She's so secretive.

759
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:52,806
Aren't you curious?

760
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:55,933
Richard, if you want to find out what's
going on in a girl's life,

761
00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:58,704
you certainly don't talk to her boyfriend.

762
00:30:58,767 --> 00:30:59,391
Follow me.

763
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,786
Why? Where are you going?

764
00:31:00,852 --> 00:31:01,918
Follow me.

765
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:06,461
Emily, is she home?

766
00:31:06,544 --> 00:31:09,908
No, she's out. I wouldn't burst in
here like this if she were home.

767
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,017
We should not be here. This is prowling.

768
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,769
We're not prowling.
You can't prowl in your own house.

769
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:17,741
This is called "showing concern." Now
tell me what we're looking for.

770
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,728
I-I don't feel good about this.

771
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:23,707
It's usually at this point in the John Le
Carré novels where things go horribly wrong.

772
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:27,474
Oh, don't worry.
I used to do this all the time with Lorelai,
and the things I found...

773
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:31,452
Once, I opened the bottom drawer
to her dresser, and it was
chock-full of tootsie rolls.

774
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:33,867
Hundreds and hundreds,
practically spilling out.

775
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:36,947
What could a girl possibly want with
a drawer full of tootsie rolls?

776
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:39,603
Perhaps it was what was under
the tootsie rolls, Emily.

777
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,737
Under the tootsie rolls!

778
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:44,370
Oh, my god!
I should have looked under the tootsie rolls.

779
00:31:44,432 --> 00:31:46,536
Oh, that's gonna bother me.

780
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:48,448
God knows what she had in there.

781
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:51,697
Let's split up. I'll hit the bedroom.
You finish up in here.

782
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,410
What am I supposed to do?

783
00:31:53,498 --> 00:31:56,741
Check the bookcase.
They love hiding things behind books.

784
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:01,735
My. This room has really come together.

785
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:04,553
But we should have gone with
the plantation shutters.

786
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:07,597
Oh, my god! Richard!

787
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:09,107
What? What's wrong?

788
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:11,164
The Birkin bag.

789
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:13,792
All handmade.
And look at those tiny stitches.

790
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:15,400
Oh, does that Logan have taste.

791
00:32:15,457 --> 00:32:17,165
Okay, this is ridiculous.

792
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:18,084
Let's get out of here.

793
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,744
Oh! And that smell!

794
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:20,755
Let's just go.

795
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:22,782
Can't you at least tell me what
you were looking to find.

796
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,911
I don't know. It wasn't my idea to break in.

797
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:28,028
Snooping without knowing what you were
snooping for? Honestly, Richard.

798
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,135
Let's just go, Emily-- now.

799
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,444
And leave that purse.

800
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:33,536
I was going to leave the purse, Richard.

801
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:37,394
A 21-year-old girl has a Birkin bag,
and a grown woman doesn't.

802
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:39,189
Ah!

803
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:44,269
I highly recommend miniature golf,
where, coincidentally, I
hold the single-round record.

804
00:32:44,343 --> 00:32:47,314
The property's got closed-circuit,
so you can forget about mulligans.

805
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:48,532
Thank you.

806
00:32:48,614 --> 00:32:52,205
And don't forget the giant urn at Luke's.
The kids will love it.

807
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:55,075
Lorelai. Look.
I'm sitting in a little gazebo.

808
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,103
I can see that, Kirk.

809
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,751
If you look real quick,
you might think it's the regular size gazebo,
and I'm a giant.

810
00:32:59,802 --> 00:33:00,871
That would be frightening.

811
00:33:00,882 --> 00:33:03,388
Have you gotten your free map
of historic Stars Hollow yet?

812
00:33:03,455 --> 00:33:05,406
Hot out of the press.
Everyone's enjoying them.

813
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,569
Maps, huh? I didn't know there were maps.

814
00:33:07,676 --> 00:33:11,365
Can I interest you in an historic
poncho or Stars Hollow kazoo?

815
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:13,390
Um... no, you really couldn't.

816
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,061
Kirk, the Dragonfly's not on this.

817
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:19,249
Right. As build, the map only represents
historic Stars Hollow.

818
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:21,592
But the Dragonfly is part
of historic Stars Hollow.

819
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:24,954
Correction. Used to be, before you rejected
your historic street name.

820
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,252
You took me off the map?!

821
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:29,849
All cartographical decisions are strictly
the province of the director of tourism.

822
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:32,142
You and I talked about the street
names only this morning.

823
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:34,289
How could the Dragonfly
already be off the map?

824
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,146
You know the saying-- cross the don
in the morning, sleep with
the fishes in the afternoon.

825
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,444
Plus, Taylor has one of those
fast laser printers.

826
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,278
This is not fair.
The Dragonfly is a business in Stars Hollow.
This is not right.

827
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:47,321
I wish there was something I could do.
But I'm just a messenger.

828
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:50,722
Assistant to the messenger, actually.
Taylor's been clear on that.

829
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:54,412
Okay, okay, I shouldn't do this.
I'm gonna look the other way.

830
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,703
Take a button. One only, please.

831
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:26,979
Hello?

832
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,408
I'm turning your bedroom into a
gift-wrapping room. And I have
to get rid of your dollhouse.

833
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,119
Do you want it?

834
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:31,620
What?

835
00:34:31,682 --> 00:34:35,294
Your dollhouse. It's quite cumbersome,
and I have absolutely no place to put it.

836
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,158
Um... well, have you checked the basement?

837
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,559
'Cause I'm betting there's oodles of
space down there right about now.

838
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:44,895
I'm doing some housecleaning. And I've
only sent you things I was going
to give you eventually anyway.

839
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:46,406
Now do you want the dollhouse or not?

840
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:47,444
Of course I want it.

841
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,179
Fine. When will you come pick it up?

842
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,421
Well, when I can.

843
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,019
I need you to give me a time, Lorelai.

844
00:34:52,075 --> 00:34:52,923
I don't know.

845
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,175
As soon as possible, okay? I'm very busy.

846
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,201
Fine. But I can't store it forever.

847
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:58,872
Call me the moment you work
out your schedule.

848
00:34:58,934 --> 00:35:00,742
Oh, I will-- the very moment.

849
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:10,339
Hey, you!

850
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,350
Get away from the urn.

851
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,259
- Hey.
- Hi.

852
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:17,945
- Kiss?
- I'm too mad.

853
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:21,446
Okay. Wait, what, 'cause your lips would
be all fiery and it would hurt?

854
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,222
Do you know they changed my street name?

855
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,464
Uh, hello, yes. Where have you been?

856
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:26,414
I figured, I don't have business cards,
who cares?

857
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:29,632
But every piece of mail I get,
I got to change the address.

858
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:31,878
Every piece of mail, because I live upstairs.

859
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:32,737
I'm aware of that.

860
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:34,298
It's a huge hassle.

861
00:35:34,354 --> 00:35:34,977
I know.

862
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:39,511
And I am in violation of ordinance 22-B.

863
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:41,082
What is ordinance 22-B?

864
00:35:41,143 --> 00:35:45,599
Kids playing on the urn requires a jungle-gym
license, as stated in ordinance 22-B.

865
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,171
A fine has already been levied.

866
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:49,042
- Uh, Taylor?
- Yes.

867
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:50,382
So wait. Are you mad at Taylor again?

868
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,314
- Yes.
- Yay!

869
00:35:51,355 --> 00:35:52,874
A jungle-gym license.

870
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:56,200
If I want kids playing on my urn,
no one's gonna tell me I need a license.

871
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:59,049
Hey, you. Go ahead. Play on the urn.

872
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,128
This stinks.

873
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:02,232
Oh my God.
I'm so glad you ditched this zen thing.

874
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:06,216
Because tonight, at the town meeting,
I'm taking it to the people,
and the people are gonna take it to Taylor.

875
00:36:06,268 --> 00:36:07,691
Good. Take it to him.

876
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:12,791
I've got a speech all planned,
listing the years of Taylor wrongs,
the abuses, the manipulations.

877
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:15,107
I'm gonna get in there and
make people understand

878
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:18,614
that they don't have to blindly
follow Taylor Doose anymore.

879
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:20,706
Good. Do it. They'll follow you.
They like you.

880
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,985
They do like me. I'm gonna use that.

881
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:24,552
I'd go, too,
but I'd end up throwing a bench at him.

882
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:26,415
There is no need. I'll handle him.

883
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,392
Want some coffee?

884
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:28,609
I'm beyond coffee.

885
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:30,447
Beyond coffee. This is big.

886
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:32,631
I'm fueled by my righteous indignation.
I'll fill you in later.

887
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:33,824
- I'll be here.
- Bye.

888
00:36:37,506 --> 00:36:38,417
Hey!

889
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:39,717
How did it go?

890
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:41,215
It went great.

891
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:43,185
So, come on. Tell us what happened.

892
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:47,708
Well, before the town meeting,
I stopped by Luke's. Right?
And he was furious.

893
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:51,390
Taylor slapped him with a jungle-gym fine.
Smoke was pouring out of his ears.

894
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:55,633
And I told him, "don't worry.
I am on my way to take Taylor down."

895
00:36:55,688 --> 00:36:56,819
Ooh, goody.

896
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,687
So, I go to the town meeting.
It's already started.

897
00:36:58,743 --> 00:37:01,675
And I come in the back door
with the squeaky track,

898
00:37:01,716 --> 00:37:03,768
so everybody knows Lorelai's in the house.

899
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:05,297
It's very exciting.

900
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:10,280
Taylor's yammering about septic tanks,
ans Patty made her raisin cake,
and everything's just going along.

901
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:12,373
Suddenly, Taylor says, "it's time to break."

902
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:15,859
And I stand up on the bench,
totally "Norma Rae,"

903
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:20,326
and I write "strike" on my town-meeting
flier. And I hold it up, all defiant.

904
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:24,517
Of course, the "Norma Rae" reference was only
in my head, and everyone was very confused.

905
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:26,231
Yes, it happens a lot with you.

906
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:28,601
I march to the front,
and I look this town in the eye.

907
00:37:28,652 --> 00:37:31,670
I said, "we, your Dragonfly Inn,
are not on the map.

908
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:34,785
We've been tossed off by Taylor
'jungle-gym monitor' Doose.

909
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:36,813
It is not right. And he must be stopped."

910
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:40,697
Since no one heard my conversation with Luke,
I lost them again for a minute.
I got them back real quickly.

911
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:43,021
- You really need to work on that.
- Let her talk!

912
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:47,674
Anyhow, I told the town how I had
given the best years of my life
and we-ve turned the Dragonfly

913
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,236
into a class A top-notch destination
Inn and that leaving us off the map

914
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:55,174
was petty and mean-spirited and
just plain bad business.

915
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:57,631
Amen. Kiss the ground.
The south will rise again.

916
00:37:57,687 --> 00:37:58,817
What happened then?

917
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:02,392
Then I turned to Taylor, and I said,
"if you don't put us back on the map,

918
00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:05,918
it will be Molly Ringwald giving her
underwear to Anthony Michael Hall,

919
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:10,061
and he shows it to a roomful of boys who
have all paid a dollar to see it."

920
00:38:10,107 --> 00:38:11,663
Oh, come on.

921
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:12,963
No. That one, he got.

922
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,592
He thought for a minute,
and he stood up and then he said to me,

923
00:38:15,648 --> 00:38:19,353
"Lorelai donate $100 to the Stars
Hollow historical society,

924
00:38:19,415 --> 00:38:22,299
and I will let you back on the map,
and you can keep third street."

925
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:23,460
$100?

926
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:24,867
That's nothing.

927
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:25,809
What did you say?

928
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,786
I said, "you got a deal."

929
00:38:26,868 --> 00:38:28,535
Oh, thank god!

930
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:32,501
Then he said,
"good girl," and patted me on the head.

931
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:34,301
- Oh no.
- Don't tell me...

932
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:36,803
We are on Sores and Boils Alley.

933
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:39,832
We cannot be on Sores and Boils Alley.

934
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,240
Patted me on the head, Michel, like a dog.

935
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,183
It's only $100.

936
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:44,707
I'll pay the $100.

937
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:45,797
You're not paying the $100.

938
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,650
I'll pay $75.

939
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:49,598
No, no one is paying anything.

940
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:50,898
We're not being extorted.

941
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:53,348
We are the Inn on Sores and Boils Alley.

942
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,745
Historical, proud.

943
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:56,342
Oozing, festering.

944
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:57,217
Draining.

945
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:58,884
Too many words for the brochure.

946
00:39:02,947 --> 00:39:03,576
Hello?

947
00:39:03,627 --> 00:39:05,382
Why haven't you come to
get the dollhouse yet?

948
00:39:05,437 --> 00:39:06,728
Because I've been working.

949
00:39:06,784 --> 00:39:10,318
Well Goodwill's picking it up at noon
tomorrow, so if you want it, come and get it.

950
00:39:10,385 --> 00:39:11,808
I can't come tomorrow.

951
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,920
Then come tonight. We're up until 11:00.

952
00:39:13,992 --> 00:39:16,291
No, mom. I'm 30 miles away. And I'm busy.

953
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:17,464
Then it's being donated.

954
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:19,819
You can hold on to it a little while longer.

955
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:22,597
Out of the question. It's taking up space,
and I can't have it here.

956
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:24,377
Why does Goodwill have to come at noon?

957
00:39:24,454 --> 00:39:25,954
Because that's the appointment I got.

958
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,449
It's Goodwill Lorelai, not Sotheby's.

959
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:30,215
You know, I can't believe you.

960
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:33,458
You know this dollhouse means a lot to me.
And I know it means a lot to you.

961
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:36,462
If you want to be this mean and vindictive,
then fine, give it to Goodwill.

962
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:39,092
Give it away. Light it on fire. I don't care.

963
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:45,543
Logan?

964
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:47,538
I don't think they saw me.
Can you get this open?

965
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:50,141
Logan, it's okay. You can use the front door.

966
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,951
No, this is cool.
I got a tree stump I can use as a boost.

967
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,450
Or you can let down your hair.

968
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,755
I talked to them.

969
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:56,434
You did?

970
00:39:56,511 --> 00:39:58,861
Yeah. It's fine. Come around to the front.

971
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:00,058
Okay.

972
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:08,166
You do know I will be mocking you for a year
for trying to climb in my kitchen window.

973
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:09,583
I just can't face another sit-down.

974
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:12,514
No, it was a misunderstanding. I talked
to my grandmother and my grandfather.

975
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:13,984
He was not trying to pressure you.

976
00:40:14,035 --> 00:40:15,958
He gets that we're young
and just started dating.

977
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,574
And he's not interested in our being serious.

978
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:19,902
Really?

979
00:40:19,994 --> 00:40:22,813
Yeah. He's very sorry about the confusion.

980
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:24,042
He is?

981
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,293
He wants to apologize to you himself.

982
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,582
And you're sure about this?

983
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,278
I double super-swear on my Birkin bag.

984
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,797
Okay, that's good.

985
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:35,415
This cloak-and-dagger stuff is getting
a little tricky if you don't own
a dagger and look funny in a cloak.

986
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:37,077
I'm sure you look great in a cloak.

987
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,142
Everything's cool?

988
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:39,302
Everything's cool.

989
00:40:39,385 --> 00:40:40,444
Good.

990
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,029
- Logan...
- Yeah.

991
00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:43,068
I love you.

992
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:45,533
Wow.

993
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,887
The lady who sold that purse
said this was gonna happen.

994
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to spring that on you. I just--

995
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:55,633
I wanted to say it, so I said it.
But I don't expect anything.

996
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,248
Believe me, I was in the position
once where someone said that to
me completely out of the blue,

997
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:03,860
and I was completely thrown. So don't worry.

998
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:06,136
You don't have to respond immediately.

999
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:09,810
I mean, in fact,
you don't have to say anything at all.

1000
00:41:10,664 --> 00:41:15,519
Look...
I've told a lot of girls I love them before,
and I didn't mean it.

1001
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:19,223
So I'm not gonna do that to you.

1002
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:22,984
Boy, that didn't come out right.
It was supposed to sound a lot more--

1003
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,577
Hey, you don't have to say anything at all.

1004
00:41:31,676 --> 00:41:33,175
One antique bellows.

1005
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,090
Salvation army.

1006
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:37,186
Wood and leather, brass studs.
This thing's a real beaut.

1007
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:39,492
Either buy it a ring or move on. Next.

1008
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,917
Doughbeater, early '60s.
They don't make them like this anymore.

1009
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:43,810
