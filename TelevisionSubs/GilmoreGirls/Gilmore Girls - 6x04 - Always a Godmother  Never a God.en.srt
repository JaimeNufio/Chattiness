1
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:05,051
Oh, now come on. Come on.
You have got to be kidding me.

2
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:06,374
Luke, come down here.

3
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:09,291
This baseboard's not level.
I can tell just by looking at it.

4
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:11,342
Tom told you. It's a work in progress.

5
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:14,732
Disaster in progress.
This baseboard belongs in a fun house.

6
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:18,664
Luke, going up there is like busting
into an operating room in the
middle of a heart transplant

7
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:22,571
and getting mad at the surgeon because
the guy's heart is on the outside.

8
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:24,469
And you're like, "hey,
his heart should be in his chest."

9
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:27,247
And the surgeon's like, "dude, I'm not done
yet." Get out of the operate room.

10
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:29,365
I got to check the bathroom fixtures.

11
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:32,488
Hey, uh, help. Fire, fire.

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,568
We're on fire down here. Help.

13
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:37,554
Flames crackling, marshmallows toasting.

14
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:38,395
Save us.

15
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,426
What are you doing yelling "fire"?
You can't do that.

16
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:43,265
No, that only pertains to movie theaters,
crowded ones.

17
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:46,956
If you're watching a Wednesday matinee
of "Deuce Bigalow," you
can yell "fire" all you want.

18
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,603
Hell, you can start a fire,
and no one will complain.

19
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,275
So, how is your project going?

20
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,705
- Like gangbusters.
- Looks like it. You're getting rid of a ton.

21
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:54,806
No, no. Whoa, there, mister.

22
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:57,413
Those are the keepers.
These are the ones I'm tossing.

23
00:00:57,468 --> 00:00:59,011
There's two videotapes in there.

24
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:00,955
Every journey begins with a single step.

25
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:04,668
This was your idea, remember-- use the
remodel to purge yourself of useless stuff.

26
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,312
Yeah, useless. I'm keeping what I need.

27
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,739
You need an episode of "Magnum
P.I." from 1986.

28
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:13,050
Of course not. That tape is mislabeled.

29
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:15,087
That's a "Knots Landing" from 1981.

30
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,311
All the women are held hostage at gunpoint
during Ginger's baby shower-- classic.

31
00:01:18,347 --> 00:01:20,967
"21 Jump Street"-- season one.
You do not need this.

32
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:23,915
- I need my "Jump Street." - So buy the DVDs.
It'll save you a ton of space.

33
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,304
No, the DVDs won't have the
commercials on them,

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,775
the original commercials,
which is half the fun.

35
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:32,180
Spuds Mackenzie, Clara Peller,
"Nothing comes between me and my Calvins."

36
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:33,836
I mean,
they don't make them like that anymore.

37
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:35,412
You're gonna be one of those weird old people

38
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:38,395
who hoards empty film canisters
and laundry measuring scoops.

39
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:41,471
Uh, gonna be.
Hey, I've been looking for this.
Check it out.

40
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:42,913
"Riding the bus with my sister."

41
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:45,861
Rosie O'Donnell plays a retarded woman
who's obsessed with riding the bus,

42
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:48,439
and Andie MacDowell is her uptight,
big-city sister.

43
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:49,922
- Sister?
- Yeah, and it gets better.

44
00:01:49,957 --> 00:01:53,025
In the ads I saw, the Rosie character
was calling herself the sheriff

45
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:57,275
and bragging about her sex life
and buying toilet seats.

46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,227
And Anjelica Huston directed it.
Maerose directed it.

47
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:03,577
Okay, fine. Watch it tonight after I leave.
Then you can dump it tomorrow.

48
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,801
You kidding? You don't just sit down
and watch a movie like this.

49
00:02:06,838 --> 00:02:08,010
This is a Friday-night special.

50
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:11,785
I'd have to have takeout, pizza, red vines,
mallomars-- the works.

51
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:13,892
Plus, there's no way I would
watch this by myself.

52
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:17,542
This is exactly the kind of movie
I would watch with someone...

53
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:19,547
Someone else, you know?

54
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:24,620
Yeah, right. Well, at least try to pare
this box down a little, please?

55
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:26,311
I'll try. I will. I promise.

56
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:26,973
Good.

57
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,573
- If you promise not to go upstairs again.
- I just got to check on one thing.

58
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,727
Oh, look at that-- "America's Castles,"
the special Florida edition.

59
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,099
Seen it five times, keeping it.

60
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,351
One thing.

61
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:41,134
Oh, "The History of Paper," a documentary by
Ted Burns, distant relative of Ken Burns.

62
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,743
Oh, seven hours, dull, dull, dull.
Keeping it!

63
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,667
I'm not going up.

64
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:45,493
Good.

65
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:47,892
"Please don't eat the Daisies,"
seasons two and four.

66
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,072
I've been looking for this.

67
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:49,068
Come in.

68
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:50,206
Good morning, miss Gilmore.

69
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,191
Good morning.

70
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,693
Oh, wow, need help?

71
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:53,708
No, thank you.

72
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:54,687
What's that for?

73
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:57,606
Mrs. Gilmore instructed me to help
you with your summer things.

74
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:58,703
My summer things?

75
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:01,472
Mrs. Gilmore says that autumn is
the time for sweaters and wool,

76
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:04,122
not for sundresses and flipper-floppers.

77
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,091
Oh. Well, I don't really dress seasonally.

78
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,444
I just sort of go with the flow.

79
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:10,920
That is what Mrs. Gilmore
would like to correct.

80
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:11,696
Oh.

81
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:15,059
Hello?

82
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:16,838
Hello, Rory, it's your grandmother.

83
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:19,525
Grandma, we were just talking about you.

84
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,479
How are you? How's Helsinki?

85
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,150
Cold, unaccommodating,
a population of walking dead.

86
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:26,720
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

87
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,745
The cab driver from the airport was a thief.

88
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:32,568
And the cuisine isn't fit for a stray
cat-- kippers and cabbage rolls.

89
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,205
And the weather-- it snowed
6 feet last night,

90
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:38,035
and apparently they can't fly
under those conditions.

91
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,839
Can't or won't, it's hard to say.
I defy you to read a Finn.

92
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,927
Yeah, they can be pretty stoic
in those northern climes.

93
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:49,885
Uh, excuse me,
but I actually use a lot of this in autumn.

94
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,720
You know, light layers.

95
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,575
Anyway, your grandfather and I are going
to be delayed a couple of days.

96
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:57,242
I'm sorry. That stinks.

97
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,929
I'm in a real bind. I've got that mixer
with the girls I'm hosting tomorrow

98
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:03,128
with the curators of the
Gilbert Stuart exhibit.

99
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:04,678
Oh, right.

100
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,168
I wear it with tights.

101
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:09,964
...But here I am thousands of miles away,
stuck in a land of reindeer stew,

102
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,674
and I'm loathe to cancel because there's
nothing Constance Betterton would like more

103
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,977
than for me to slip up so she can destroy
my reputation, run me out of the D.A.R.,

104
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:21,105
then jump in the air like a cheerleader
and land doing the splits.

105
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:24,582
Uh, wow. That's-- the splits, huh?

106
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:26,986
Um, whatever I can do to help, grandma.

107
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:28,810
I wear white after labor day.

108
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:31,098
- Rory?
- I'm a rebel. Just go with it.

109
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:32,119
Are you still there?

110
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:33,276
Yeah, I'm still here, grandma.

111
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:37,052
I was wondering if you could possibly fill
in for me. I would be so grateful.

112
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:40,389
- Me? At the mixer?
- It's all ready to go.

113
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:43,615
The menu is set,
and these new caterers I found are fabulous.

114
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,719
All you have to do is smile and make sure
everyone's cocktails are replenished.

115
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:47,544
Well...

116
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:50,158
Just picture that snake doing the splits.

117
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:55,330
Um, okay, grandma. I'll help you out.

118
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:56,868
Oh, bless you.

119
00:05:56,945 --> 00:06:00,561
I'll check in a little later and give you
a briefing about some of the canapés.

120
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,919
Good, because I'm rusty on canapés.

121
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:03,829
Call you later.

122
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,718
Okay, bye, grandma. Stay warm.

123
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:11,683
Maid?

124
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:14,584
No, this is not going to work.

125
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:15,554
Maid?!

126
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:18,614
A bath?
A baptism is nothing like taking a bath!

127
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:20,050
I'm not saying it's a bath!

128
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:23,521
I'm just saying if you don't believe
in the religious aspect of it,

129
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:26,931
then it's like a bath-- as simple
and as brief as a bath.

130
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:29,122
- Coffee.
- It is so not like taking a bath!

131
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,273
When you take a bath, there are candles

132
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:34,555
and water-warped entertainment
weeklys to read and soap.

133
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:38,769
There are not people standing around praying
over you, at least not when I take a bath.

134
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:39,550
Who's getting baptized?

135
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,934
Oh, our kids are, because apparently
we're suddenly super-religious.

136
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,990
No kidding. Would you guys mind moving
over just a little bit? Thanks.

137
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:46,282
Sookie, look at the baptism
as a bargaining chip.

138
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,291
If we give my mother this,
then it'll soften the blow when she finds out

139
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:51,722
that we're not having any more children
because of the vasectomy.

140
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:55,474
They'll want to stay at the house if we
have this baptism-- your whole family.

141
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:56,864
We'll just have to make room.

142
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:59,788
How? The house is barely big
enough for us and the kids.

143
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,710
We'll end up sleeping on a leaky
air mattress in the kids' room

144
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:07,151
and getting horrible creaks in our
neck while your mother blasts
her "flatt and scruggs" CD.

145
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:10,790
And your cousins are gonna be picking
their teeth with my paring knives.

146
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,909
Oh, like your family is so easy!

147
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:15,241
What about the time we had to see
your stuttering cousin Odell

148
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:18,077
in the worst production of "Nicholas
Nickleby" known to man?!

149
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:21,306
That was like nine hours of pure hell!

150
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,805
And did I get to fake a heart attack
during intermission? No!

151
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:28,777
I'm sorry. There is a difference between
nine hours and three full days.

152
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:32,970
There's 48 hours plus 24, whatever that is,
minus 9 hours.

153
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,158
What does that equal?

154
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,639
48 and 24, so that's, uh...

155
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,170
eight and four... and that's two...

156
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,627
and 10 over.

157
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,240
Whoa! Whoa! Sookie, don't do math.
You know that hurts your head.

158
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:46,769
Ow.

159
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:48,118
Hey, I have an idea.

160
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:51,471
If you're gonna have the baptism and you've
got three days of family in town,

161
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:52,947
how about if they all stay here?

162
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,010
At the Inn?

163
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:54,969
Yeah.

164
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,012
Just give me the dates. We'll work it out.

165
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:57,993
And that would be okay?

166
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,701
Sookie, you're part owner of the place.

167
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:00,552
Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:01,464
That would really help.

169
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:04,182
So, cool. I'll take care of the arrangements.

170
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,665
Sookie, you just deal with
the post-baptism party.

171
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:09,513
Oh. I didn't know anything about
a post-baptism party.

172
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,422
You didn't tell me anything
about a post-baptism party.

173
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:12,992
I didn't know myself.

174
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:16,230
I've got some late-summer salad recipes
I've been wanting to try out.

175
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:17,943
Oh, perfect.

176
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,184
Okay, well,
just let Michel know how many rooms you need,

177
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,050
and I'll see you guys later.

178
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:24,963
- Thanks, Lorelai.
- Yeah, thanks, hon.

179
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:27,806
I just need the invoice signed
for the zucchini and I'm off.

180
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,075
You think I'm taking this zucchini?

181
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,040
You ordered them.

182
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:31,004
You stressed them out.

183
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,286
- Don't point that thing at me.
- Guys.

184
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:33,727
I can tell. Get them out of here.

185
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:35,153
No, you give me the invoice.

186
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:36,757
I'll just have one of my guys
get them out of here.

187
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:39,001
This isn't about the zucchini.
This is about the baptism.

188
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:41,637
Well, I christen these vegetables sucky!

189
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:45,853
Oh, hello, Sarah.
Thank you so much for coming.

190
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,207
Excuse me. Hold on a sec.

191
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,067
This tray is half empty.

192
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,154
Should we fill it up to
make it look less sad?

193
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:53,682
Uh, this is the last tray.

194
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,522
What?

195
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:56,185
Oh, no.

196
00:08:56,862 --> 00:09:00,856
Oh, boy, there are only eight trays of salmon
puffs allotted for the whole night?

197
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:01,906
This is not good.

198
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:03,314
This is really not good.

199
00:09:03,364 --> 00:09:05,705
Do you think I should have
staggered their release?

200
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,199
I should have.
I should have staggered their release.

201
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,977
Okay, well, just spread them out,
and then push the shrimp.

202
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:13,889
Okay, you can circulate now. Circulate.

203
00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:16,987
Uh, excuse me.

204
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:19,326
There's garnish on this tray
and there shouldn't be.

205
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,226
My grandmother hates garnish.

206
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:23,345
Here, I'll just, uh-- there you go.

207
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,108
Okay, go, circulate. Circulate.

208
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:28,682
- Hello, Lana.
- Hello.

209
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,358
Nice to see you. Carole, hello. Great dress.

210
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,286
Darla, does the pearls council
know about you?

211
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:36,276
Fabulous.

212
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,548
Everything all right over here, ladies?

213
00:09:38,598 --> 00:09:39,854
Everything's perfect, Rory.

214
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:41,044
This is a lovely party.

215
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,920
And those salmon puffs-- insane.

216
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:45,444
Aren't they, though? Eight trays,
and they're almost gone.

217
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:47,852
I might have to go grab a
pole and do some fishing.

218
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:49,674
Let me know if you need anything.

219
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,611
I like the way he paints Washington's hair.
It looks so luminous.

220
00:09:55,668 --> 00:10:00,379
If Gilbert Stuart were alive today,
I would absolutely commission him
to paint a portrait of my Henry.

221
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,447
Well, Martha Washington had the same impulse.

222
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:05,313
In 1796, she commissioned Stuart
to do a portrait of her husband

223
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,246
along with the one of herself
to hang at Mount Vernon.

224
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:10,434
Henry's not Nora's husband.
He's her springer spaniel.

225
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:11,174
Oh.

226
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,564
May I freshen your drink, Nora?

227
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,023
Well, thank you, Rory.
That's awfully sweet of you.

228
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:17,935
Vodka tonic. No ice and light on the tonic.

229
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:19,024
I'll be right back.

230
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:21,402
Isn't she just darling?

231
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,996
Excuse me? Hi.

232
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:30,917
The woman with the red hair
over by the paintings,

233
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,292
could you get her a vodka tonic,
please, A.S.A.P? Thanks.

234
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,314
No ice and light on the tonic.

235
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:48,387
Oh, Rory, perfect.

236
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:50,249
Maybe you could help us with something.

237
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:51,166
Absolutely.

238
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:54,294
We're admiring this plant here-- this
one with the waxy leaves--

239
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:57,648
and yet the name for it has gone
right spot out of our heads.

240
00:10:57,714 --> 00:11:00,221
I'm so sorry. I'm not sure what it's called.

241
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:02,528
But I promise to ask my grandmother
and let you know.

242
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,406
Let me just get your phone number here.

243
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:07,523
Oops! Garnish.

244
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,405
You just can't get away from it, huh?

245
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:12,214
Um, excuse me for a minute.

246
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:15,661
Hey, I didn't know you were coming.

247
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:19,203
Yeah. I forgot you had a thing today.

248
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:21,700
Oh, it's okay,
because now I get to show you off.

249
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:25,721
Nancy, Lucy,
I'd like to introduce Logan Huntzberger.

250
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:29,531
Logan, this is Nancy Osgood
and Lucy Faxton-Field.

251
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:32,770
How do you do, Logan? It's such a pleasure
to meet the young Huntzberger.

252
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:33,677
Hey.

253
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:38,615
Uh, Logan, I think I've told you about Nancy.

254
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:42,184
She's the one who insists I look like
Clara Barton, which I'm still
not sure is a compliment.

255
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,719
Oh, it's a compliment of the highest order.

256
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:52,995
Um, well, if you'll excuse us,

257
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:55,962
I think I promised Logan one
of the coveted salmon puffs.

258
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,732
So nice to meet you, Logan.

259
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:03,918
Want some coffee?

260
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:07,156
With your scotch?

261
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:10,494
Sorry, I'm just not in the mood to deal
with this type of thing right
now, these type of people.

262
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,925
Why? Did something happen?

263
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:13,626
So how long do you think
this thing's gonna last?

264
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:17,399
Um, an hour, hour and a half tops,
and then 15 minutes for me

265
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:20,553
to pay the caterers and make sure the
cleaning staff knows what to do.

266
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:23,097
Hey, why don't you go hang
out in the pool house,

267
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,645
and then I'll come out as soon as
I finish up here? We could talk.

268
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:26,818
Yeah, okay.

269
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,326
We need coffee!

270
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:36,233
There's no more coffee.
Someone make some coffee!

271
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,489
Okay, Paul Anka, dinnertime.
You need to eat tonight, okay?

272
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:45,487
Now, this is the kibble you like in the
nice, new, yellow bowl that you picked.

273
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,847
I will now...

274
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:50,933
I will now back out of the
room so you can eat...

275
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:54,267
in the dark, like you like.

276
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:28,507
We're sorry. You have reached a number
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in serv--

277
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:42,238
We're sorry. You have reached a number
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

278
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,108
If you feel you reached this number at--

279
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:54,898
So, I cancel with him, darling.
Is that so difficult?

280
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,098
I find the fact that you love
him completely irrelevant.

281
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:00,548
What's going on?

282
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,199
Hey, is that my salmon puff?

283
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:02,970
Yeah. I--

284
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:04,824
Anything is good in a puff.

285
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:05,860
- Hi.
- Hi.

286
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:06,706
Hey, Rory.

287
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:08,727
Hey, Colin.
I didn't know you guys were coming over.

288
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,418
I invited them over. I hope that's cool.

289
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,671
Oh, yeah, of course it's cool.
I just-- I would have brought more puffs.

290
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,045
- You need a drink.
- Oh no, I--

291
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,752
Somebody give me a sonnet.
Melissa's a poetry major.

292
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,273
There once was a gal from Nantucket.

293
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:21,833
Stop it, Colin. I'm not trying to propose.

294
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,319
Melissa, do you miss me, darling?

295
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,462
Hi.

296
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,307
Uh, Logan?

297
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:29,922
Yes.

298
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,759
Who's the skirt?

299
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:32,692
Ah, that is Colin's roommate.

300
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:33,943
He brought her back from Holland?

301
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:34,772
Yes, he did.

302
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:35,634
Oh.

303
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,691
Hi. I'm Rory. I've heard a lot about you.

304
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:40,357
She doesn't understand English.

305
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:41,968
Oh, sorry.

306
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,080
Yes, aren't we all.

307
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:44,016
Colin, rude.

308
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:46,633
Everywhere I go,
everything I do-- surprise-- there she is.

309
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,786
Well, you brought her here.
What did you expect?

310
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:52,396
I don't know what happened.
When we were in the Netherlands,
she seemed so amazing, you know?

311
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:54,545
But the minute we left,
she began to lose her appeal.

312
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:57,631
Everything looks appealing when you're
stumbling out of an Amsterdam coffee bar.

313
00:14:57,672 --> 00:15:00,344
Tell me about it.
I spent half an hour hitting on a bike.

314
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,554
Maria, you're the only one that can save me.

315
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,342
Rory, you have to understand-- milkmaids
are iconic over there.

316
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,046
They're practically dutch superheroes.

317
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,325
Dating Katrinka was like dating wonder woman.

318
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:10,054
Katrinka.

319
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:12,392
Yeah, he's gonna be hearing about
that one for a long time.

320
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:13,736
Oh, I see.

321
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:16,300
Well, just so you know,
I think you're an awfully sweet girl

322
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:19,038
to date a guy with such an unfortunate
skin condition.

323
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:22,883
Rory, any chance you're breaking up
with Logan in the next 20 minutes?

324
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:23,991
Sorry.

325
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:26,339
Veronica-- Finn.

326
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:27,935
Still engaged, darling?

327
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:31,452
Well, I am, too,
but I'm not going to say in what.

328
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:35,066
So, this is a surprise,
the guys being here and everything.

329
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:37,496
Well, Colin just got back. I hadn't seen him.
Is that okay?

330
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:40,224
Oh, yeah, it's fine. I just--

331
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,870
you seemed like you were
in a bad mood earlier.

332
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,799
Well, this is how you get
out of a bad mood, ace.

333
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:46,219
Hey, let's get something to eat.
I'm starving.

334
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:49,264
Yes. Chinese food. No dairy in Chinese food.

335
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,151
Perfect. General Lee's has that adorable
waitress with a very
tiny intellect. Let's go.

336
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:54,987
- General Lee's?
- General Lee's.

337
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,222
Just give me a minute, and I'll go change.

338
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,211
No way,
you've got that hot librarian thing going on.
I like it. Grab a book. Let's go.

339
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,554
I've got shotgun.

340
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:03,549
No, you don't. You're driving.

341
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,903
I can reach over to steer.

342
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:10,450
Uh, Colin, you forgot your milkmaid.

343
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:18,972
Okay, room 5 just checked out,
so let's give that to Jackson's sister Adele.

344
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:23,403
Put cousin Rachel in room 3 and aunt
Pat and uncle Rusty in room 6.

345
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:27,264
Okay, that's two people in room 6.

346
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,520
Aunt Pat and uncle Rusty,
they're gonna need two keys.

347
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:31,094
I gave them one. They can share.

348
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,905
It's the least the freeloading hicks can do.

349
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,098
They're not freeloading hicks.
They're our guests.

350
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,453
They are moochers.

351
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:40,246
They go supermarket-hopping to gorge
themselves on free samples

352
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,765
and get their perfume from magazine inserts.

353
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:45,722
You can recognize them from the
paper cuts on their wrists.

354
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,674
Oh, Jackson not here yet?

355
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,618
No, but his family's arrival is imminent,

356
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,494
so I'm off to nail the furniture
to the floor.

357
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:56,176
I don't believe it.
The whole clan will be here any minute.

358
00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:57,198
Sookie, relax.

359
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,074
I can't relax. It's Jackson's family.

360
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,499
I try to say nice things to them,
but they misinterpret it and
they think I'm insulting them.

361
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,395
So I've tried being really quiet,
and then they get all like,
"why are you so quiet?"

362
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:09,457
So I overcompensate and start cracking
jokes like I'm carrot top,

363
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,724
and I start doing funny things with props.
I hate prop comedy.

364
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:13,917
We all do, honey.

365
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:15,262
They're right behind me.

366
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:17,741
Jackson, you almost left me bufferless.
What happened?

367
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,733
Aphids happened, all over my tomatoes.

368
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:22,762
And I was squirting them,
and they're multiplying,
and I lost track of time.

369
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,296
So I start racing over here on foot,
and I saw Bo's minivan just in front of me,

370
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,824
so I cut through the thicket,
and you know how I hate the thicket,

371
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:30,464
just so I could get here first.

372
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,966
Oh, my god, my breath.
I can't catch my breath.

373
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:35,115
I'm breathing out, but I can't breathe in.

374
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,195
Okay, Jackson, calm down. You're here, right?

375
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:39,032
He's here. Your buffer's here.

376
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,518
I got my buffer. It'll be okay.

377
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,944
Okay, so, did you tell hmm-hmm about hmm-hmm?

378
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,737
No, he's your family.
You tell hmm-hmm about hmm-hmm.

379
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,943
Why do I get the feeling I'm at
least one of the "hmm-hmm"s?

380
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,522
Lorelai, we need to tell you something.

381
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,152
Remember my brother Bo?

382
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:58,644
Uh, dark hair, coarse stubble,
Jefferson Davis tattoo?

383
00:17:58,696 --> 00:17:59,707
He thinks you're a nympho.

384
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:00,280
A what?

385
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,917
It's short for nymphomaniac.

386
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,505
It means you really dig the fellas.

387
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:05,038
I know what it means, but how?

388
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:06,961
I didn't say two words to
the guy when I met him.

389
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,632
I said one-- hi.

390
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:10,766
And that was not in response to,
"what's your sex drive like?"

391
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,134
Apparently, Cousin Rune told him.

392
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,232
Rune-- short guy, light hair,
thought marijuana gave your salad zest?

393
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,045
That's the one.
Bo said Rune said you're a horn dog.

394
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,215
A horn dog?

395
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,203
His word, not mine.

396
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:22,501
His family, not mine.

397
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:24,266
Mom!

398
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:25,439
Buffer.

399
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:27,229
Welcome to the Dragonfly.

400
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:28,953
Hi, everybody.

401
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:33,824
Oh, my,
that's quite a bit of luggage for three days.

402
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:36,669
You are just staying three days, aren't you?

403
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:38,833
That's right, little brother-- three days.

404
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,540
Why don't you all relax.
I'll take care of checking us in.

405
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:45,134
Well, hello, L.G.

406
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:46,438
Welcome to the Dragonfly Inn.

407
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:47,380
Welcome to Bo.

408
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:49,335
Nice sunglasses. Very "Risky Business."

409
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:50,811
Risky Business, huh?

410
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,343
Are you into risky business?

411
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,174
No. All of a sudden I hate it.

412
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:56,246
Tom Cruise in his underwear
makes me want to barf.

413
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:57,547
Would you like to register?

414
00:18:57,918 --> 00:18:59,164
I would love to.

415
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,428
You just signed the blotter.

416
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,740
Oh, whoops.

417
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,643
Sorry. I was distracted.

418
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,176
Well, um, you're in room 7,

419
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,739
so just take a right at the top of
the stairs and enjoy your stay.

420
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,423
Well, aren't you accommodating.

421
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:17,822
I guess I'll just go get my duffel
bag out of the minivan.

422
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:21,969
That's the first time I ever heard
the word "duffel" sound dirty.

423
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,282
I am so, so sorry.

424
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:26,184
All right, here are their keys.
Names are on the envelopes.

425
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:27,621
They can go up any time.

426
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,061
I am so, so sorry.

427
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:32,952
Ooh, uncle Artie hugged me too long.

428
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,310
Lorelai checked Bo in.

429
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:36,839
We are so, so sorry.

430
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,710
Keys!

431
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:38,798
Let's get them upstairs.

432
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,654
I got your keys, everybody.
Come and get them.

433
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,035
Come and get them.

434
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,775
Just thought I'd give you
my room number, princess.

435
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:51,785
I have it.

436
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,549
Remember, I checked you
in about a minute ago?

437
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:55,681
All right, then. See you soon.

438
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:07,352
He asleep?

439
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:08,402
He's waiting for his muse.

440
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:09,624
Don't say it like that.

441
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:10,182
Like what?

442
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:11,741
All condescending. It's not cool.

443
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:12,901
I wasn't condescending.

444
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:17,289
Songwriting is about making yourself open and
vulnerable so that the lyrics come out true.

445
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:20,027
If I'm being sensitive,
that's a byproduct of my craft.

446
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:20,806
I hear you.

447
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:22,406
Okay, now you just patronized me.

448
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:23,898
I wasn't patronizing you.

449
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,882
Carry on.

450
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:27,255
What's with her being all dismissive?

451
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:28,476
Hey, you want to get more fries?

452
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:31,174
Oh! Yes! Yes!

453
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:32,978
Dude, you said "fries," and it hit me.

454
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:33,496
Really?

455
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:34,825
Quick, get this down.

456
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:36,716
Go.

457
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:41,398
Wait, what?

458
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:42,931
Just get it down before I forget it.

459
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,638
it's not lyrics.

460
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:48,212
Duh, it's a melody. Come on.

461
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:52,001
Okay, okay.

462
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:53,339
- Get it?
- I think so.

463
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:56,416
Up, down, further down, little higher up,
down a smidge.

464
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:58,037
- Brian!
- I don't read music.

465
00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:58,827
Great.

466
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:00,348
Lane, come here.

467
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,297
What?

468
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:06,128
I need your cellphone so I can call home
and leave a tune on our machine.

469
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:07,851
I don't bring my cellphone to work.

470
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,953
Um, you're starting to freak
out some of the customers.

471
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,850
I just want you to know I feel
really helpless right now.

472
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:19,131
Luke, Luke, Luke, look, look, look.

473
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:20,936
Luke, Luke, Luke, look, look, look.

474
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,210
That's kind of funny. It just came out.

475
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:24,228
Sookie, I'm working.

476
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,858
I know. I just came by to show you this.

477
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:27,530
What's that?

478
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:32,329
This is a vintage cake-topper-- porcelain
bisque, hand-painted I think in the 1940s.

479
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:33,647
Shoulder pads on the shoulders.

480
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:37,606
I found it at a flea market this
morning-- it's perfect.

481
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,621
Perfect for what?

482
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,272
For your and Lorelai's wedding cake.

483
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:41,953
Oh, well, that's nice.

484
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:45,136
Nice? Nice? It's not nice-- it's fate. Look.

485
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:48,172
Perhaps this looks familiar.

486
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:49,254
His butt.

487
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:50,782
It's your butt.

488
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,504
It's your butt, Luke. It's your butt.

489
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:55,793
Stop screaming,
"it's your butt." People are eating.

490
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,885
What are the odds of me finding a cake-topper
with exactly your butt?

491
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,662
Turkey burger with Swiss.

492
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:06,289
Oh, when I found this topper,
your whole cake came to me,
like in a vision--

493
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,027
white and sparkly with beautiful daisies
made of fondant on the top.

494
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:12,764
Cow burger with cheddar.

495
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:16,979
So, now that I know the cake,
all you have to do is set the date.

496
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,190
When is the date?

497
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:19,429
I don't know.

498
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:20,645
What do you mean, you don't know?

499
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:22,665
I mean I don't know.

500
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:27,342
Luke, Miss Manners said you're not really
engaged until you have a ring and a date.

501
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:30,505
Yeah, and it's tacky to drink from a can,
but there you go.

502
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,587
Luke, please.

503
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,731
Look, you know the drill here, Sookie.

504
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:37,502
We're not setting a date until things
are settled between Lorelai and Rory.

505
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,940
And when exactly is that going to be?

506
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,755
I don't know.

507
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:41,796
Well, what do you plan to do about it?

508
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:42,639
Nothing.

509
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:44,268
Nothing? What kind of an answer is that?

510
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,788
Sookie, it's between them.

511
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:47,559
Me and my butt are staying out of it.

512
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:51,595
Oh, come on. You know this whole non-talking
thing between Lorelai and Rory is ridiculous,

513
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:53,393
- and you know it.
- I do know it.

514
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:55,660
Grilled cheese, double order of fries.

515
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:59,321
Well, all I can say is that those two
better make up before your butt falls

516
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:02,428
and this gorgeous antique cake-topper
is nothing more

517
00:23:02,477 --> 00:23:05,361
than a kitschy piece of junk from the 1940s.

518
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,540
Crap. I got to go.

519
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,731
I left Jackson's mother in the car.

520
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,052
Maybe I should have cracked the window.

521
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:23,199
Hi, Mrs. Lamkin.

522
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:33,315
What is going on? What is that?

523
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:37,731
Hey, this is the G5 dual 2.3
with a one-gig ram upgrade.

524
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:41,618
This 3 1/2-inch aluminum casing
houses a 300-gig hard drive.

525
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:43,171
And we got pro tools, too.

526
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:45,756
We're gonna be able to record like
a million tracks every song.

527
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:48,591
We can burn, mix, and edit our own CDs.
It's gonna be nuts.

528
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:50,811
Yeah, just as soon as we figure
out how to turn it on.

529
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:52,770
But how? When did...?

530
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:56,036
Oh, my god! The tour money!

531
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,558
You went into my underwear drawer?!

532
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,799
I cannot believe that you went
into my underwear drawer.

533
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:06,891
But that's where the tour money was.

534
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,557
But that was my underwear drawer.

535
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:10,167
It was business, not pleasure, Lane.

536
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,607
I had my eyes closed the entire time.
It was all by feel.

537
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,196
That was my room, my private inner sanctum,
and you ransacked it.

538
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:17,966
Hey, we could be mad too, you know.

539
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:21,484
Frankly, the fact that you felt you
had to hide the tour money
from us is pretty insulting.

540
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:24,405
Yeah, and that money was for recording
equipment, anyway. So what's the big deal?

541
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:26,897
But did you at least shop around?

542
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:30,596
I mean, did you go through the stack of
research I have on recording equipment,

543
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,862
cost comparisons, audio magazine articles?
Did you happen to look at any of that?

544
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:35,862
Jeez, we didn't go through
all your stuff, Lane.

545
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:38,640
I can't believe you spent 9 grand
without talking to me.

546
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:39,897
It wasn't the plan--

547
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:43,942
I mean, we just cruised by the store
to get a microcassette recorder
so I could preserve my tunes.

548
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:45,173
And there was this salesguy--

549
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:46,033
A great guy.

550
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:48,772
A really great guy.
And we ended up talking to him about music.

551
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:49,935
And Zach sang him his tune.

552
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:52,120
Which he totally dug.
Reminded him of early Smiths.

553
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:52,951
Great guy.

554
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,272
He was, and he was like,
"you should get this."

555
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:59,334
And he was like, "this is the last day of our
once-a-year sale, and everything's 30% off,"

556
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,990
and he showed us this whole system.

557
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:03,052
- He spent like an hour with us.
- Totally great guy.

558
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:04,416
He thinks we're gonna be huge.

559
00:25:04,478 --> 00:25:05,625
Was there change?

560
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,225
Huh?

561
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:08,302
Did the totally great guy
give you any change?

562
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:16,276
- She totally would have liked him.
- 'Cause he was a great guy.

563
00:25:16,988 --> 00:25:21,386
I believe Jackson's aunt Pat is borrowing
DVDs from our collection

564
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:26,482
and secretly burning copies
for her own DVD library.

565
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,058
What makes you think she's
not watching the DVDs?

566
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,652
The Belleville's are freeloaders,
the whole lot of them.

567
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:35,661
They are as cheap as tan panty
hose with white sandals.

568
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:39,876
Plus, I believe they have emptied all
the booze from the minibars upstairs

569
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:45,030
into their own flask and then refilled
the bottles with water.

570
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:46,510
Can I interest you in a sick day?

571
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,434
Pssh, I would not give them the satisfaction.

572
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:54,109
Oh, how proud a family reunion
must be for you.

573
00:25:54,597 --> 00:25:56,253
- He's snarky.
- And sarcastic.

574
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,458
He's snarcastic.

575
00:25:57,524 --> 00:26:00,171
Hey, do you have a minute? I want to
ask you something kind of important.

576
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:02,314
Sure, I've got nothing but minutes.

577
00:26:02,555 --> 00:26:07,630
Well, I was wondering if you would honor me
and Jackson by being Martha's godmother.

578
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,764
Oh! Oh, wow.

579
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:11,882
Oh, is that a good "oh,
wow" or a bad "oh, wow"?

580
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,969
It's just "oh, wow."

581
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:18,008
The whole idea of me being a godmother-- I
never thought of
myself as the godmother type.

582
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,024
Would I need a wand?

583
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,788
I think you can pull it off without it.

584
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,731
Oh, jeez, Sookie, I'm touched.

585
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,562
I would love to be Martha's godmother.

586
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,576
Great. Oh, I'm so happy you said yes.
It's going to be great.

587
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:31,857
And we're gonna baptize both kids at once,
so Davey's gonna need a godmother, too,

588
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:33,951
and I thought, "how about Rory?"

589
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:35,648
Rory, huh?

590
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,365
Yeah, I thought it would be fun.

591
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,293
And I know it's weird with you two now,

592
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:41,773
but there's really no one
else I'm close to to ask.

593
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:45,399
Oh, yeah? What about your friend
Kat from the culinary institute?

594
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:47,158
You guys roomed together in college.

595
00:26:47,245 --> 00:26:48,527
She's been institutionalized.

596
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,086
- What? Really?
- Oh, yeah.

597
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:52,921
She shaved her head.
She thinks she's Susan Powter. Sad.

598
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:55,736
How about Theresa?
She lived next door to you growing up.

599
00:26:55,778 --> 00:26:58,054
Aren't her husband and Jackson best friends?

600
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,490
- She moved.
- She moved?

601
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:00,740
- To Peru.
- When?

602
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:02,926
- Yesterday, actually.
- Tall, skinny Margo?

603
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,278
Has an inner-ear problem.

604
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:08,402
Frankly, I'm a little worried she'll
lose her balance holding the
baby and fall in the water.

605
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:10,719
She's tall, so that's a long way to fall.

606
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:13,944
But, hey, look, if you don't want to do
it or you don't want me to ask Rory,

607
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:16,287
then I'll totally understand.

608
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:18,716
I'm sure Jackson will understand, too,
and Martha.

609
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,019
Hey, you got to do what you got to do.

610
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:25,953
No, no, it's okay. Um, I'll do it.

611
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:28,023
- You will?
- Of course I will.

612
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:29,530
Oh, thank you.

613
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,402
It's gonna be a perfect day.

614
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,563
Which one goes better with a baby?

615
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:58,162
I like the green one.

616
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:00,306
It's not too sheer?
Because I'm gonna be in a church.

617
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:01,527
Looks good from here.

618
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:02,675
Yeah, maybe.

619
00:28:02,902 --> 00:28:04,541
Man, she's good. She's really good.

620
00:28:04,597 --> 00:28:05,653
- Who?
- Sookie.

621
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:09,074
This whole baptism thing is just a
ruse to get me and Rory together.

622
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:11,740
She's played me.
She's played me like a Stradivarius.

623
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:12,863
So, don't go, then.

624
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:14,525
- No, I got to go.
- Why?

625
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,232
Because she asked me to be a godmother.
You don't say no to that.

626
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:18,914
- Why?
- Look, I know what she's doing,

627
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:21,595
and she knows what she's doing,
but no one else knows what she's doing,

628
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:24,875
so on the chance she's not doing what I think
she's doing, which is actually just doing

629
00:28:24,924 --> 00:28:27,536
what she wants to do, then I will be the
jerk who wouldn't be the godmother

630
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:30,635
to her best friend's baby 'cause she thought
something was happening that wasn't.

631
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,987
And that will be the story everyone
remembers, understand?

632
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:34,623
I like the green dress.

633
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,259
Go back to sleep.

634
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,909
I have to go to the baptism.

635
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:47,381
Blow it off.

636
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,149
I can't.

637
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,554
You can do anything.
You just have to believe in yourself.

638
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,134
Did we learn nothing from "mad hot ballroom"?

639
00:28:56,184 --> 00:28:58,314
I have to go to Stars Hollow.

640
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:01,645
I have to see my mom.

641
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,690
One, two, cha cha cha.

642
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,870
Ohh, okay.

643
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:12,443
Nothing left to do but get
up and face the music.

644
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,714
Which goes better with a baby?

645
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,740
You're wasting your time, Lane.

646
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:52,940
That manual's just a bunch of gobbledygook.

647
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,213
Got to be R2-D2 to understand that thing.

648
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:58,764
No, you just have to spend more than
six minutes trying to figure
it out before giving up.

649
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:01,006
I can't believe there's a second c-span.

650
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:04,712
Hi.

651
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:05,583
Rory.

652
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:07,686
Hi. Am I interrupting anything?

653
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:09,167
Nah, there's nothing on.

654
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:11,941
No, you're interrupting nothing. Come on in.

655
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,156
Wow, this looks very fancy.

656
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:17,782
Yeah, it's pretty fancy, all right.
Apparently is does everything except turn on.

657
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:19,514
You look pretty fancy, too.

658
00:30:19,581 --> 00:30:21,931
Oh, I'm on my way over to
Sookie's kids' baptism.

659
00:30:21,981 --> 00:30:23,243
I'm gonna be Davey's godmother.

660
00:30:23,302 --> 00:30:25,400
Very religious. My mother would be impressed.

661
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:28,304
Hey, is it true you get to keep
the baby if the parents die?

662
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,057
I'm just doing it as a favor for Sookie.

663
00:30:30,123 --> 00:30:31,257
Godmother, huh?

664
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,651
Did you make her an offer
she couldn't refuse?

665
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:36,209
- Dude, you nailed that.
- Thanks.

666
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,932
Come on, I need a break from the A.D.D. boys.

667
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:42,128
Whoa! There's a third c-span!

668
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,454
Room looks the same.

669
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:47,500
Yeah.

670
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,003
How come there's a padlock
on your dresser drawer?

671
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:52,054
Long story. Here, sit.

672
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,915
So, you look great. Did you get a haircut?

673
00:30:54,982 --> 00:30:57,151
Yeah. Well, maybe a month ago.

674
00:30:57,262 --> 00:30:58,642
- I like it.
- Thanks.

675
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:01,165
You look good, too. I like the bangs.
Very Marianne Faithful.

676
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:03,401
Thanks. I'm hoping Mick Jagger notices.

677
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:05,944
So, you went on tour.

678
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:06,846
Yeah, we did.

679
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:07,595
And how was it?

680
00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:09,086
- Great.
- Great.

681
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:13,285
And, um,
how are things in the Zach department?

682
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:14,841
I mean, you two are still together, right?

683
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:18,286
We are, and it's good. He's good. We're good.

684
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,654
How many times can I use the word "good"?

685
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:22,454
Have you guys...?

686
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:25,873
No, no, no, we're still not having sex,

687
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:28,534
but I did tell Zach he could tell
the guys we're doing it.

688
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,796
It's a little more rock 'n' roll.

689
00:31:29,873 --> 00:31:31,320
You are a good girlfriend.

690
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:33,405
So, how's Logan?

691
00:31:33,662 --> 00:31:37,651
Logan is... a constant surprise.

692
00:31:37,724 --> 00:31:39,349
I have trouble keeping up with him.

693
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:41,784
He moves a mile a minute,
gets bored in two seconds flat.

694
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:46,267
He started flying those scary little planes
that seem like they're made of papier-mâché,

695
00:31:46,312 --> 00:31:49,927
which is thrilling, by the way.
And Logan's good.

696
00:31:49,983 --> 00:31:51,901
Wow. Is this serious?

697
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:53,347
Seriously exciting.

698
00:31:53,403 --> 00:31:57,455
I love that. Is it hard with him still at
Yale and you with your grandparents?

699
00:31:57,761 --> 00:31:59,258
No, not really.

700
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,532
It's been fine, actually.

701
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,663
Taking time off has been great.

702
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:04,822
It was absolutely the right decision for me.

703
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:06,714
That's good. That's really good.

704
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:07,684
Yeah.

705
00:32:08,237 --> 00:32:12,190
Yeah, I just wish that my mom
could understand that.

706
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:13,508
She's so...

707
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:17,467
I doubt that she will talk to me again
until I am back in a dorm room

708
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:19,953
with a course catalog on my lap, if then.
I don't know.

709
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:21,076
Maybe we'll never talk again.

710
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,675
You two? Oh, please.

711
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:23,946
We haven't talked in weeks.

712
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,286
It'll blow over.

713
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:28,090
She didn't tell me when she
and Luke got engaged.

714
00:32:28,352 --> 00:32:30,484
Rory, look at me.

715
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:36,022
You and your mom will talk again. This rift
is nature's attempt to find some equilibrium.

716
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:39,380
You and Lorelai have gone too
many years without fighting.

717
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:41,944
So you had to have one big
fight to make up for it.

718
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,304
Now you've had it, and soon you'll
make up and then this will
all be just your lost weekend.

719
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:47,467
I've missed you.

720
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:48,759
I've missed you, too.

721
00:32:49,743 --> 00:32:52,174
We can never go this long
without talking again.

722
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,620
- Deal.
- I'll do anything.

723
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,870
- I'll raise carrier pigeons.
- I'll learn morse code.

724
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:57,845
I'll send you pigeons,
and you can send me code.

725
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:58,778
Okay.

726
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:02,398
Oh, it's 10:30.
I have 15 minutes before I have to go.

727
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:04,342
Now, I want to hear all about that tour.

728
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,264
Okay. Let's start with the "three
boys and no shower" thing.

729
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:09,345
Oh, lord.

730
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:16,564
You look nice today, Kirk.

731
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,958
Thanks.
This is the suit they buried my dad in.

732
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:20,677
Oh, well...

733
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:23,297
I think I'm gonna let that one go.

734
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:26,700
Do you know which is the Davey
side and which is the Martha?

735
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:28,957
I don't think there are sides.
It's not like a wedding.

736
00:33:29,003 --> 00:33:31,065
I think we're all on both kids' sides.

737
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:34,376
I just didn't want to offend by taking
a side if there are sides.

738
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:36,895
I've had some contact with Davey in passing--

739
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:39,331
couple of high-fives,
one or two peekaboo sessions,

740
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:41,699
but I haven't had much contact with Martha.

741
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:44,206
She seems more reserved, elusive.

742
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,063
There's a bit of Garbo in her.

743
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:54,263
I just talked to my former mother, and, oh,
you are going to love this.

744
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,922
Guess who's getting baptized today?

745
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:57,156
- Who?
- Me.

746
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,455
What? No. Is it Christmas already?

747
00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:00,625
This isn't funny.

748
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,517
You've never been baptized?

749
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:05,644
Apparently on the day I was supposed to be
baptized, I stuck a quarter up my nose

750
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:08,341
and had to be taken to the hospital,
and they never rescheduled.

751
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,275
Organizational skills were never
your family's strong point.

752
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:13,716
You know what? I have had it with my family!

753
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:18,049
I want you to march right over there and tell
my mother you're divorcing
me if I get baptized.

754
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:20,325
Oh, yeah, that will go over very well.

755
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,621
Okay, fine.
Then just say we're getting separated.

756
00:34:24,753 --> 00:34:28,589
I guess I better go find out what it means
exactly for a grown man to get baptized.

757
00:34:28,661 --> 00:34:30,932
Oh, my god,
are you gonna wear a giant christening gown?

758
00:34:31,004 --> 00:34:32,429
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?

759
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:33,901
Ooh, you have no idea.

760
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:39,094
Oh, Rory's here!

761
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,629
Yeah, I see that.

762
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,367
Boy, that's a pretty dress she's wearing,
don't you think?

763
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,575
Sure. It'll go good with a baby.

764
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:49,064
Well, I better go check on the kids.
Say hi to Rory for me if you see her first.

765
00:34:52,212 --> 00:34:54,883
Oh, there you two are. Good.
Do you have a minute?

766
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:57,591
I was hoping we could have a quick chat
in my office before the ceremony.

767
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,534
- Oh, well...
- Um, sure.

768
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:01,215
Wonderful. Right this way.

769
00:35:02,307 --> 00:35:05,194
So, I always like to take a few
minutes before my baptisms

770
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:07,196
to get to know the godparents a little bit.

771
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:10,115
Of course, I already know you two,
but I just want to touch base

772
00:35:10,156 --> 00:35:13,495
and make sure you understand the obligations
of what you're getting into here today.

773
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:18,336
Now, basically, godparents are responsible
for the spiritual upbringing
of their godchildren.

774
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:20,623
I certainly hope the parents
throw their two cents in,

775
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,273
but the godparents are vitally important
figures in a child's life.

776
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:27,144
So, tell me,
what are your religious affiliations?

777
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,554
Oh, well, reverend, you've known us forever.

778
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:33,923
Well, yes, I have, and I still have no idea
what your religious affiliations are.

779
00:35:33,984 --> 00:35:35,211
- Oh...
- Well...

780
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:37,257
We're a bit lapsed.

781
00:35:37,328 --> 00:35:39,717
Yes. From...?

782
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:42,128
Well, um... religion.

783
00:35:42,189 --> 00:35:47,454
But, you know, I can't speak for Rory,
but I have a strong belief in good...

784
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,929
you know... over evil.

785
00:35:49,986 --> 00:35:52,099
I mean, if I was asked to choose a side...

786
00:35:52,727 --> 00:35:54,607
I read "the lion, the witch,
and the wardrobe."

787
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:59,396
I have a bible.
I may have accidentally given it to goodwill,
because I'm remodeling.

788
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:01,868
But goodwill is a religious organization...

789
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:03,043
I think.

790
00:36:03,129 --> 00:36:05,621
But even if it's not,
good will-- it's in the ballpark.

791
00:36:05,682 --> 00:36:07,650
I buy tons of girl-scout cookies.

792
00:36:07,717 --> 00:36:10,466
I have two "Mary is my homegirl" t-shirts.

793
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:14,394
These are all very positive if
somewhat irrelevant things.

794
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,393
And it seems like your hearts
are in the right place.

795
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:17,291
Absolutely.

796
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:18,095
Definitely.

797
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:20,877
And it says something good about you
both that when a friend calls you up

798
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:23,193
and asks a favor, you come through like this.

799
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:25,258
Right, right.

800
00:36:25,368 --> 00:36:26,146
Shall we?

801
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,054
We shall.

802
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:34,021
So, are you a Davey or a Martha?

803
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:36,334
Davey, I bet, right?
He's much more accessible.

804
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:39,743
He's the Dandy Warhols to Martha's
Brian Jonestown massacre.

805
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:45,266
Oh. Dang it.

806
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,356
Hey, Rory. You look so pretty.

807
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:50,364
Hey, Sookie.

808
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,008
Oh, I want a picture of this.

809
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,691
Welcome, everybody.

810
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,249
Jesus tells Nicodemus in the fourth gospel,

811
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:02,806
"unless one is born of water and spirit,
one cannot enter the kingdom of god."

812
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:05,924
Today we gather to honor three individuals

813
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,416
as they dedicate themselves in the
first sacrament of the faith

814
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,118
and become members of the body of the church

815
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,036
and the kingdom of god.

816
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:19,542
Here to bear witness and offer
spiritual support are Lorelai
Gilmore, godparent to Martha,

817
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:23,557
Rory Gilmore, godparent to Davey, and,
uh-- Jackson.

818
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,249
- Yo.
- Acting as your godparent will be...?

819
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,298
Oh, uh... my brother Bo, I guess.

820
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:34,366
And, uh, Bo Belleville will serve as
sponsor and witness for Jackson.

821
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:36,120
Will you come up here, please, Bo?

822
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:37,043
Oh!

823
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:38,452
Oh, bananas.

824
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:42,395
The candidates for baptism
will now be presented.

825
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:52,147
We are honored with the privilege of being
here today to witness and support in faith

826
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:55,319
the baptism of David Edward Belleville,

827
00:37:55,399 --> 00:38:01,074
Martha Janice Lori Ethan Rupert Glenda
Carson Daisy Danny Belleville,

828
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,685
and Jackson Matthew Belleville.

829
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:07,848
I hereby charge Lorelai Gilmore,
Rory Gilmore, and Bo Belleville

830
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:13,320
with the responsibility of seeing to
the spiritual welfare of these
children and this believer.

831
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,734
We will now begin a series
of ceremonial questions.

832
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:21,657
Lorelai Gilmore, do you renounce Satan
and all the spiritual forces
that rebel against God?

833
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:25,424
Lorelai.

834
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:26,376
What?

835
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:28,015
Why aren't you renouncing Satan?

836
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:31,793
He said, "do you renounce Satan?" That's
not something you pause about.

837
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:34,048
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, yes, I renounce Satan.

838
00:38:34,132 --> 00:38:35,268
Okay.

839
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:40,751
Rory Gilmore, do you renounce Satan and all
the spiritual forces that rebel against God?

840
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:41,562
Did you call Rory?

841
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:42,068
What?

842
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,627
Did you call Rory on her cellphone
and ask her to be a godmother?

843
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:46,960
I renounce him.

844
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:49,462
- Bo Belleville...
- What are you whispering about?

845
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,222
- I'm just trying to get some information.
- What information?

846
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:53,189
Satan can kiss my ass.

847
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:54,723
How come Sookie had your phone number?

848
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:55,258
What?

849
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,046
She called you to ask you to be here, which
means she must have had your phone number.

850
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:01,214
Excuse me. Ladies?

851
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:05,414
I'm sorry, reverend.
Can you just give us a moment, please?

852
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,844
What is wrong with you?

853
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:12,283
It's not like I really care, okay?

854
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,903
It's not like I was gonna call you
up to chitchat or make a date to
go shoe shopping or something.

855
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,118
But shouldn't a mother have a way to
contact her daughter at least
in case of an emergency?

856
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:22,671
What if I was in a accident and had
to have a blood transfusion?

857
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:24,553
You're the only person in the world
with the same blood type.

858
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,020
It would really help to
have your phone number.

859
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:27,370
We are holding up the service.

860
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,959
It's weird you would give Sookie
your number and not me.

861
00:39:30,006 --> 00:39:31,516
I didn't give Sookie my new number.

862
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:34,747
Sookie called grandma,
grandma left me a note,
and then I called Sookie back.

863
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:36,292
And I didn't get a new number.

864
00:39:36,348 --> 00:39:37,584
I lost my phone.

865
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:41,162
If you lose your phone, you should suspend
your service until you get a new one.

866
00:39:41,223 --> 00:39:43,561
That way, you get to keep the same number.
Ever hear oh that?

867
00:39:43,622 --> 00:39:47,145
It's ridiculous to get an entirely new
number. No one gets an entirely new number.

868
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:49,468
Well, next time, I will suspend my service.

869
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,600
Um, hi, guys. We kind of need the kids back.

870
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:59,251
Hey, godmother.

871
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:00,225
Hi.

872
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:03,241
So sorry again for the drama.

873
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:05,004
You always give me a good story to tell.

874
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:06,348
I aim to please.

875
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,056
I have a little confession to make.

876
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:11,295
I kind of asked you and Rory to both
be godmothers because I thought

877
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:14,064
it might kind of bring you back together,
patch things up.

878
00:40:14,105 --> 00:40:15,177
Well, blow me down.

879
00:40:15,228 --> 00:40:16,186
Didn't fool you, huh?

880
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:17,714
No, but the salads are excellent.

881
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:19,443
The salads are excellent.

882
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:23,863
Okay, that's it.

883
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:24,934
I'll be right back.

884
00:40:29,923 --> 00:40:30,635
Hi, Bo.

885
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:31,651
Hey, darlin'.

886
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:36,383
What do you say we get out
of these wet clothes?

887
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:39,782
Listen, Bo,
there's been a misunderstanding here.

888
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:41,881
What Rune told you about me-- it's not true.

889
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:42,393
Really?

890
00:40:42,444 --> 00:40:43,193
None of it.

891
00:40:44,257 --> 00:40:46,569
- So you don't have a kid?
- Well, no, I do have a kid.

892
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:48,310
You didn't get knocked up when you were 16?

893
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,771
Well, that part technically is true.

894
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:51,279
And he said you've never been married.

895
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:52,951
That you're just single and dating around?

896
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:56,093
Well, I've never been married exactly,
but I'm engaged now.

897
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:57,770
That's pretty steady, very permanent.

898
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:59,124
He said you were engaged before.

899
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:01,364
It's all true-- I'm a horn dog.

900
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:04,215
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna get some potato salad.

901
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:06,138
Potato salad.

902
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:08,015
I get it.

903
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:09,301
Okay.

904
00:41:11,787 --> 00:41:13,214
So, I'm leaving.

905
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,793
Okay. Drive safe.

906
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:20,797
Look, I know this is lame at this point, but
you can have my new number if you want it.

907
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:21,791
That's okay.

908
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:24,140
I can call mom, and she can leave you a note.

909
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,048
Okay.

910
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:27,125
Okay.

911
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,292
- Hello?
- Hey.

912
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:42,190
Hey, how was the baptism?

913
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:44,044
Fine. I don't know.

914
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:45,569
I don't know what's going on.

915
00:41:46,193 --> 00:41:48,929
I'm not handling things particularly
well these days.

916
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,629
Yeah, I know what you mean.

917
00:41:51,536 --> 00:41:52,829
Logan, are you okay?

918
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:58,048
I had a talk with my father the
other day, and apparently I'm
going to graduate this year.

919
00:41:58,104 --> 00:42:01,215
I'm going to get my act together and
I'm gonna become a Huntzberger.

920
00:42:01,274 --> 00:42:02,227
What does that mean?

921
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:04,721
I'm going to start attending
shareholder meetings,

922
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:06,441
letting the boys see my face around.

923
00:42:06,514 --> 00:42:09,000
It means my preordained life is kicking in.

924
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:10,385
Oh, I'm sorry.

925
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:13,364
Hey, always read the fine print
on the family crest.

926
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,492
Maybe you can talk to your dad
and tell him how you feel.

927
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:18,522
Hey, how far away are you from the airport?

928
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:19,225
Why?

929
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,605
Let's go to New York.

930
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:21,701
What?

931
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:24,603
New York, you and me right now by helicopter.

932
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,228
A helicopter? You're kidding.

933
00:42:26,285 --> 00:42:27,716
We will spend the weekend at the Pierre.

934
00:42:27,757 --> 00:42:29,424
You don't have your community
service till Monday, right?

935
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:30,221
Yeah, but...

936
00:42:30,285 --> 00:42:32,642
Don't pack. We'll shop.
Much more irresponsible.

937
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,549
Um... Logan--

938
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,744
I'll see you at the airport
in 20 minutes, ace.

939
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:39,672
Okay, I'll see you in 20 minutes.

940
00:42:43,912 --> 00:42:46,928
I think he's gonna take me for a ride in it.

941
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,090
What about your boyfriend? What about Jesse?

942
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:53,578
Jesse's delicious. He's gonna take
me today to get a new toilet seat

943
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:56,760
because mine got broken and was sliding.

944
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:59,803
I would fall off of it. I go, "whoa!"

945
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,331
It's not the same.

946
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,263
All these boring hellos...
What, am I scaring you?

947
00:43:05,345 --> 00:43:07,242
Want me to scare you? Boo boo boo!

948
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:08,093
Beth...
