1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,344
Wow. Busy today.
Has Luke been advertising?

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,637
He gets good word of mouth.

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,805
We have to start spreading
bad word of mouth...

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,474
so we can always have a table.

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,809
That would be wrong, but sure.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,520
- Vermin?
- Or no potable water.

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,647
- Or no potable vermin.
- That'd scare them away.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,565
Or confuse them away.

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,611
- Weird seeing him talking like that.
- Like what?

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,904
Just all friendly.

11
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,449
He's usually only good for a couple
of gruff monosyllables, then he's off.

12
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,117
He is the master of the monosyllable.

13
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,328
He never flirts with women.
Do you notice that?

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,789
- He's flirted with you numerous times.
- Don't start.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,832
Flirt with him now. We need coffee.

16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,877
Luke, we are just dying
for some refreshments.

17
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,671
Keep your pants on.

18
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,173
He can turn it off and on so fast.

19
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,218
I found a CD
under the front seat of our car.

20
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,594
Did you lose one?

21
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,680
Not that I know of,
but I'm sloppy with them.

22
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,057
- So you didn't hide it?
- Why would I hide a CD?

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,227
- Don't know. Bay City Rollers?
- It's not a Bay City Rollers CD.

24
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,021
- How do you know?
- I know what's not hidden under the seat.

25
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,524
Because you know
Barry Manilow is under that seat.

26
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,401
- Where's Barry Manilow?
- Under Mom's seat.

27
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,987
- I confess I was hiding Barry Manilow.
- You confess?

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,905
He was very big when I was very small.

29
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,325
It's the live version where he does
a medley of his commercial jingles.

30
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,953
Don't worry.
Everyone's allowed a guilty pleasure.

31
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:21,039
Very diplomatic from the girl
who had the Bryan Adams poster...

32
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,417
- above her bed for two years.
- Fink.

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,836
- Do you have a guilty pleasure?
- No.

34
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,921
- Are you into music?
- Sure.

35
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,799
Monosyllabic Man strikes again.

36
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,927
- We'll have two muffins, please.
- You got them.

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,681
Do you think he's dated anyone
since Rachel?

38
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,892
I don't know.
Where would he meet anyone?

39
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,145
- He's either here or in his apartment.
- Maybe he has a secret life.

40
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,689
Maybe he's got a chippy
stowed away in Mt Pilot.

41
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,065
We'll know eventually.

42
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,361
- I say he's a bachelor for life.
- I say there's someone for everyone.

43
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,282
What?

44
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,700
Barry Manilow.

45
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,035
Stop.

46
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,037
Looks like we made it

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,415
- Oh, yeah? Spice Girls.
- Duran Duran.

48
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,375
- Dido.
- Olivia Newton-John.

49
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,793
The Macarena.

50
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,547
You and Lane for hours and hours,
for weeks on end.

51
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,175
We were mocking.
You can't mock the mocking.

52
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,844
- It's getting ugly. Let's stop.
- Let's be friends again.

53
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,262
All right.

54
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,351
Stop it.

55
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,534
- What?
- The car won't start.

56
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,203
- What happened?
- I don't know. It's just dead.

57
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,456
- I turn the key, it makes a horrible sound.
- What kind of sound?

58
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,335
Like... You know, but less feminine.

59
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,628
That's the battery.

60
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,672
What did I ever do
to make the battery mad?

61
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,009
Let's see. You've kept the radio on
all night, killing the battery...

62
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,179
you've kept the lights on all night,
you've kept the door open...

63
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,182
which keeps the ceiling light on all night
killing the battery.

64
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,059
Okay, I've done multiple things
to make the battery mad.

65
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,978
- Are you gonna walk?
- I'm wearing heels.

66
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,021
Change your shoes.

67
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,689
- I'd have to change my outfit.
- Do it.

68
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,067
- I'd have to walk upstairs.
- Suddenly I'm living with Zsa Zsa Gabor.

69
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,444
I'm gonna call Michel.

70
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,487
This thing is too small.

71
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,364
- Independence Inn.
- Hold on, Michel.

72
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,783
- That backpack is not too small.
- Miniscule.

73
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,911
Take your schoolbooks
and leave the others.

74
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,245
I need all of my other books.

75
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,247
- You don't need all these.
- I think I do.

76
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,958
- Edna St. Vincent Millay?
- That's my bus book.

77
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,127
- What's the Faulkner?
- My other bus book.

78
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,796
- So just take one bus book.
- The Millay is a biography.

79
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,341
Sometimes on the bus,
when I pull out a biography...

80
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,469
and I think, 'I don't feel like reading
about a person's life'...

81
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,929
then I'll switch to the novel.

82
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,389
And if I'm not into the novel,
I'll switch back.

83
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,474
Still there, Michel?

84
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,850
- Yes, I...
- Hold on.

85
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,561
- What is the Gore Vidal?
- That's my lunch book.

86
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,898
Lose the Vidal or the Faulkner.
You don't need two novels.

87
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,316
Vidal is essays.

88
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,902
But the Eudora Welty's
not essays or biography.

89
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,572
- So, it's another novel. Lose it.
- It's short stories.

90
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,576
- This is a sickness. Michel?
- I am growing very old.

91
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,662
- Come pick me up?
- I'm already here.

92
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,539
Put Carol on the desk and pick me up.

93
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,250
I'm not speaking to Carol.
She ate my low-fat cheese.

94
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,044
Come pick me up
and I will buy you some cheese.

95
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,963
- Low-fat cheese.
- Low-fat cheese.

96
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,799
- Low-fat American cheese.
- Low-fat American cheese.

97
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,300
And a meringue cookie.

98
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,386
- Just get over here.
- Fine.

99
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,848
I made it all fit.

100
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,433
Edna, Bill, Gore, and Eudora,
all safe and sound.

101
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,477
Cool. Forgot your French book.

102
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,063
I know.

103
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,691
I'm carrying my French book.

104
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,694
You so thought that French book
was already in there.

105
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,445
- You have a problem.
- No, I don't.

106
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,031
You're gonna tip over
from the weight of that backpack.

107
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,868
- No, I'm not.
- I'm gonna have to buy you a forklift. Bye.

108
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:54,479
- I startled you. I didn't mean to.
- That's okay. I'm easily startled.

109
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,940
I'm Mrs. Burdiness,
the guidance counselor.

110
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,110
- Your name's Rory, isn't it? Rory Gilmore?
- Yes.

111
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,945
Hello.

112
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,740
I'd love to sit and talk to you.
Can we do that?

113
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,824
Sure, anytime.

114
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,952
- How about after you finish your lunch?
- That soon?

115
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,414
- I think soon would be good.
- Okay. What's this about?

116
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:15,334
- We'll talk about it then.
- Not even a hint?

117
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,794
- See you in a little bit.
- Right.

118
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,674
Come in.

119
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,013
- Hello, Rory. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

120
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,433
Don't worry about being late
for your next class.

121
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:34,061
- I'll write you a note if you want.
- Okay.

122
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,064
I know from your records
you're a stickler for punctuality.

123
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,234
I am a stickler, yes.
I only slipped one time last year.

124
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:44,363
I hit a deer. Actually, he hit me. Or she did.
Or not me, my car.

125
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,200
But then he or she ran away,
and I think it turned out okay.

126
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,619
I didn't see it again,
so I can't definitively say.

127
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,121
But I did look for him or her.

128
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,292
It's a big story.
I'm surprised I don't tell it better.

129
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,503
Why don't we get to the reason
I asked you here?

130
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,798
Headmaster Charleston brought you
to my attention a few weeks ago.

131
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,843
He's worried.
After observing you a bit, I'm worried, too.

132
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,386
You've been observing me?

133
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,389
We've been concerned
about your social behavior here at school.

134
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,515
What about it?

135
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,934
You don't seem to interact much
with other students.

136
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,311
I do, sometimes. In class, all the time.

137
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,189
But rarely outside of class.
At lunch, you're always alone.

138
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,482
I catch up on reading.

139
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,734
That Walkman
makes you very unapproachable.

140
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,819
You approached me.

141
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,238
You jumped out of your skin.
What does that tell you?

142
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,614
That I'm jumpy.

143
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,950
On the Fourth of July, forget it,
I'm a wreck.

144
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,036
When the Stars Hollow orchestra
begins to play in the gazebo...

145
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,290
with the guy banging the cymbals,
it drives me nuts.

146
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,750
Denying a problem
doesn't solve a problem, Rory.

147
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,420
Unless something changes,
this could affect your future.

148
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,339
I don't understand.
I get good grades. Isn't that enough?

149
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,716
You know it's not.

150
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,511
When we make recommendations
to universities on behalf of a student...

151
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,514
that student's social skills
are a big part of it.

152
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,226
- I assume you want to go to a university.
- Absolutely.

153
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,146
Well, universities
do not look kindly on loners.

154
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,149
- But I'm not a loner.
- What do you think a loner is?

155
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,903
Loners are those guys that you see
walking around wearing, I don't know...

156
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,821
out-of-date clothing, bell-bottoms.

157
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,073
And they tend to carry a duffel bag...

158
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,284
with God knows what inside.
That's a loner.

159
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,412
Loners come in all shapes and sizes.
Even pretty girls.

160
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,624
Just try to improve, Rory.
Mix it up with others.

161
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,627
You may even enjoy it. Start with lunch.

162
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,962
I don't suppose there's a Lunchtime...

163
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,299
Reading/Walkman-Listening Club
I can join, is there?

164
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,593
I guess that's no.

165
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,970
- What does she expect?
- She said, 'Mix it up. '

166
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,222
What does that mean?

167
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,807
I guess, going up to strange kids at school
and saying:

168
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:39,311
'Mind if I awkwardly butt in where
I don't belong and don't wanna be?'

169
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,647
The whole thing's ridiculous.
Chilton is a cult.

170
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,441
- Lorelai, do you know what this is?
- No.

171
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,151
Damn.

172
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,779
I don't know.
Maybe there is something wrong with me.

173
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,073
- Don't say that.
- Maybe I am a loner.

174
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,991
You were mocking my backpack today.

175
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,078
I might be one step away
from carrying a mysterious duffel bag.

176
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,039
Don't you go doubting
who you are, how you should be.

177
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,583
- How dare she do this to you?
- It wasn't just her.

178
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,502
The meeting was Charleston's suggestion.

179
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,672
Well, good. It's time I called on
old Schnickelfritz Charleston...

180
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,882
to tell him to stop messing
with my kid's mind.

181
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,802
I don't like this.
Schools like Chilton try to stamp out...

182
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,763
every vestige of individuality.
I won't let that happen.

183
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,974
It's all fixed. I found a loose terminal.

184
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,643
I reconnected the battery and jumped it.
It's set to go.

185
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,686
Thanks.

186
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,313
No charge for the time I spent
stuck underneath the car.

187
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,439
That's great.

188
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:28,318
I just want to you know that I overheard,
and you're absolutely right.

189
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,738
I carried a duffel bag and ate lunch
by myself my entire school career...

190
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,907
and I turned out just fine.

191
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,662
I'm still going down there.

192
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,040
Ms. Gilmore is here.

193
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,542
Hello, Mr. Charleston.

194
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,003
- Ms. Gilmore, good to see you.
- Good to be here.

195
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,381
I checked my records to remind myself
why I asked you in...

196
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,050
- only to find you'd called this meeting.
- I did.

197
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:56,346
I'm surprised. We don't see you often.
We'd forgotten what you look like.

198
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,017
I'm pretty much the same.
Rosy-cheeked, strong of bone, sly of wit.

199
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,269
How nice. So why did you want to see me?

200
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:06,899
Well, I wanted to talk to you about Rory,
and this ridiculous accusation...

201
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,568
about her being a loner
and how that's something bad.

202
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,613
- Well, it is bad.
- No, it's not bad. It's just her.

203
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:16,033
I raised Rory to do what she wants,
as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

204
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:20,787
I don't see how reading a book or listening
to a Walkman is hurting anyone.

205
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,624
- It's hurting her.
- I respectfully disagree.

206
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,751
That doesn't surprise me,
based on my research.

207
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,877
What research?

208
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,881
Seeing your name on the appointment list,
I decided to have a look at the file.

209
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,009
Yes. Rory's file's
been of a lot of interest lately, hasn't it?

210
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,970
I wasn't talking about Rory's file.
I was talking about yours.

211
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,348
- I have a file?
- You most certainly do.

212
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,475
- It's tiny.
- It's very thin.

213
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,977
That's good. It means
I haven't gotten into trouble.

214
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:48,065
On the contrary, a thin file for a parent
indicates lack of participation.

215
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,526
Now, wait a minute,
I've participated in stuff.

216
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,903
- You attended a bake sale.
- And I sold stuff.

217
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,780
- Then promptly left.
- I was busy.

218
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,407
Without fraternizing
with the other parents at all.

219
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:01,119
- Busy, like a really tall bee.
- Like mother, like daughter.

220
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,246
Hold on.

221
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,874
Ms. Gilmore, active participation
in Chilton activities for a parent...

222
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,751
- is vitally important.
- But...

223
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,629
This is a list of organizations
sponsored by Chilton.

224
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,215
Parent groups
dedicated to certain specific tasks.

225
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,759
Any one of them would be honored
by your participation.

226
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,929
- Okay, my schedule is...
- We're all tremendously busy.

227
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,682
I hope you're not too busy
to do what's best for you...

228
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,893
- or what's best for Rory, are you?
- No.

229
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,063
- Excellent. Let us know what it'll be.
- I will.

230
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,610
- May I go?
- Yes, you may.

231
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,822
I'm glad you came in today.
It was a good idea.

232
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,324
Yes. I'm just full of good ideas.

233
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,623
- Hey.
- Hey.

234
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,836
- Yeah, look Fat Albert. Get me a soda?
- Mom, what are you doing here?

235
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,963
You were to meet me in my Latin class...

236
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,756
after meeting
with Headmaster Charleston.

237
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,594
Oh, my, God. I was. I totally forgot.
I'm so sorry.

238
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,096
- What happened? Did you talk to him?
- I did.

239
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,224
I said he was completely
out of line with his treatment of you...

240
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,768
that you're not a loner freak,
you've plenty of friends.

241
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,646
You don't own
a long black leather Matrix coat.

242
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,648
They should fall on their knee socks...

243
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:15,152
every day that you deign to show up
at that loser school.

244
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,321
- And?
- Then he yelled at me.

245
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,198
- He what?
- He pulled out a file...

246
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,700
- and told me I was a bad Chilton Mom.
- He did not.

247
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,078
- I don't participate in school activities.
- Well, you work.

248
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,165
- And I don't make posters.
- You have no artistic capabilities.

249
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,835
- I don't chaperon school dances.
- Does he know you got pregnant at 16?

250
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,672
Basically, I'm not doing my part
to help further your educational future.

251
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,841
So we both got busted. Great.

252
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:41,929
Now I have to pick a group or a cause
or sponsor a club or something.

253
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,388
This sucks.

254
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,849
But, hey, I've been thinking.

255
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,895
The whole reason we did this Chilton thing
is for you to get into Harvard, right?

256
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,940
And these fanatics that run your school...

257
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:56,026
are the ones that write the letters
to the fancy colleges...

258
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,904
saying things like,
'Hey, she's keen, look at her. '

259
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,949
Or, 'Have you seen the 'I'
tattooed on her forehead?

260
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,450
'Cause it sure is a big one. '

261
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,827
You're saying
we should just go along with this?

262
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,289
Go along with it. Talk to some kids.
I'll hang out with their moms...

263
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,042
and we'll get into Harvard,
take over the world...

264
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,045
and buy Chilton
and turn it into a rave club.

265
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,339
- What do you say? Deal?
- Deal.

266
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,426
Look, the Chilton Cheer Society
wear matching hats.

267
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,304
Go Harvard.

268
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,288
- Hey.
- Hey.

269
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,375
There's a bad draft where I usually sit,
kind of like a big downward gust.

270
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,752
Not exactly
'Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore'...

271
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,171
but it's still uncomfortable...

272
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,798
especially when you're just gotten
your hair to behave.

273
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,383
So can I sit here?

274
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,218
Yeah.

275
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,469
Thanks.

276
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,932
Nice table.

277
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,435
It's much more level
than the one over there.

278
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,520
- Your name is Lori?
- Rory.

279
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,980
Right. Rory.

280
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,857
- What's yours?
- Francie.

281
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,193
- You're Francie?
- No, she's Francie. I'm Ivy.

282
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,154
- Francie's spokesman.
- I am a very important person...

283
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,907
and very important people
never speak for themselves.

284
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,409
I did not know that, but I do now.

285
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,955
That's Azure, Lily, Celine,
Lana, Asia, Anna, and Lem.

286
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,041
- Lem.
- Short for lemon.

287
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,125
Oh, sure.

288
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,044
We were just discussing homecoming.

289
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,837
- Thoughts?
- Great movie.

290
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,006
That was Coming Home. Sorry.

291
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,260
I truly believe the whole homecoming
dance ritual should be put to sleep.

292
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:47,804
Or at least assigned a new color scheme.

293
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,974
- Rory, huh? Do they call you 'Ror'?
- Not unless provoked.

294
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,142
No nickname?

295
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,978
Actually, Rory is a nickname.
My full name's Lorelai.

296
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,690
- Lorelai. That's a weird name.
- Well, Lem, what can I say?

297
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,984
Sounds Southern. Are you a belle?

298
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,363
No, but apparently I command them.

299
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,533
See you later, Your Highness.

300
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,752
God! You're like a pop-up book from hell.

301
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,712
You were with the Puffs.
How did you do it?

302
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,506
- The who?
- The Chilton Puffs.

303
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,801
- You were at their table.
- I don't know. I just sat down.

304
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,387
Nobody just sits down with them.
You have to be invited.

305
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,013
Paris, it's not the Costa Nostra.

306
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,058
No, they're the Puffs.
The most influential sorority at Chilton.

307
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,394
- Chilton has sororities?
- Only ten worth mentioning.

308
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,397
The Puffs have been number one
for at least the last 50 years.

309
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,566
My mother was a Puff, my aunt was a Puff.

310
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,359
I thought only colleges had sororities.

311
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:45,195
Connections you make with them
last the rest of your life.

312
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,573
My cousin got her internship
at the Supreme Court...

313
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,325
- because of Sandra Day O'Connor.
- She was a Puff?

314
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,912
Yes. She was Puffed in 1946,
became the president in '47...

315
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:57,374
and in '48, she moved the group
to the very table you sat at today.

316
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,752
It was a controversial move then,
but she was just that powerful.

317
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:01,879
I had no idea.

318
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,715
What did you say about me?
Did you tell them you hated me?

319
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,757
I didn't mention you.

320
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,051
I've been killing myself
trying to get invited in.

321
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,804
I spent all of last year
sucking up to Francine Jarvis.

322
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,222
You mean Francie?

323
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:14,975
- You call her Francie?
- No, someone else did.

324
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,643
I've helped her with her homework...

325
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,563
secured her a prime spot for parking,
organized her locker...

326
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,774
scrunched up the plastic strands
on her pompoms to make them fluffy.

327
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,651
I've done everything except a manicure.

328
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:27,905
If I had any talent with an orange stick,
I would've done that, too.

329
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,908
I know I'm not the first to say this to you,
but you're insane.

330
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,576
Okay, look.

331
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,288
- I know you and me, we...
- Shouldn't be around each other armed.

332
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:40,667
Yes. But you have to understand,
I have to get into that group.

333
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,503
I just have to.

334
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,756
My family's name and reputation,
not to mention my entire future...

335
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,384
- all depend on me getting into that group.
- It's just a clique, that's all.

336
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,930
Look, all I'm asking is, please don't say
anything horrible about me.

337
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,806
Don't tell them that you hate me.

338
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,851
Paris, I'm not in their group.
They don't care what I say.

339
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,812
They let you sit at their table
through lunch. You're in.

340
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,983
You know what? Never mind.
Do what you want. I don't care.

341
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:12,074
- Who the hell names their kid Lemon?
- Someone really into citrus.

342
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,825
Crazy people.

343
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:18,664
It's just so weird that the one table
I sit down at is home to the secret society.

344
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,917
It's like waking up one day
and realizing everyone in your family...

345
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,003
- can pull their face off.
- Yes, it's exactly like that.

346
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,131
Your mother would like you
to head out to the patio.

347
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,051
- We're barbecuing tonight.
- Thanks.

348
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,763
- Does Grandma have a barbecue?
- I don't know.

349
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,807
Maybe she keeps it in a secret room...

350
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,685
with the paper napkins
and the mismatched sheets.

351
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,188
- Wow. She really is barbecuing.
- Cool.

352
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,274
- What's up, Poppin' Fresh?
- Corn!

353
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,317
Nice. Thank you.

354
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:54,825
What is this, a refugee camp?
Come inside and eat at the table.

355
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,494
Mom, the whole point of barbecuing
is to eat outside.

356
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,871
Animals eat outside.

357
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,915
Human beings eat inside
with napkins and utensils.

358
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,501
If you want to eat outside,
go hunt down a gazelle.

359
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,045
Make your decision. I'll be inside.

360
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,548
What are the odds
of finding a gazelle here?

361
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,842
- Slim to none.
- Okay, let's go.

362
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,265
- I'm extremely disappointed in you.
- Hold on, Mom.

363
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,937
Okay, go ahead.

364
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,731
I had lunch with Bitty Charleston today.

365
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,233
She told me what happened
with you and the headmaster.

366
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,695
Does someone do nothing but hide
under his desk with a tape recorder?

367
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:34,364
After all we've gone through
to get Rory in that school...

368
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,034
and then you humiliate all of us
by not being involved?

369
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,660
That's just incomprehensible.

370
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,079
- She wasn't involved either.
- Wow, just sitting here.

371
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,831
You are grown-up. Set an example.

372
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,876
If she's not involved with school,
then she learned it from you.

373
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,295
How hard is it to help out
just once in a while?

374
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,089
Join a group, attend a meeting.
And all for the sake...

375
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,800
Mom, stop already. Please.
I have joined a group, okay?

376
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,594
- You have?
- Yes.

377
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,929
Which one?

378
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm gonna join the Booster Club, okay?

379
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,809
The Booster Club. I'm going to boost.

380
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,313
Well, the Boosters
are a very fine organization.

381
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,191
- That's why I picked them.
- They do good work for the school.

382
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,692
All went into the picking process.

383
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:14,279
And the matching sweatshirts they wear
are just darling.

384
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,701
We're certainly not doing it like last year.

385
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,454
- God, was that awful.
- It wasn't that bad.

386
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,499
When we finished paying
for everybody's stomach to be pumped...

387
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,376
there was no money left to buy bleachers.

388
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,794
The salsa band was wonderful.

389
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,339
- This is giving me a migraine.
- I vote we take a break.

390
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:36,510
- Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
- It's all right. Can we help you?

391
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,638
Yes, actually.
This isn't the Booster Club, is it?

392
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,098
Yes, it is.

393
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,642
Thank God
you're not wearing sweatshirts.

394
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:47,312
You know what? Never mind.
I'm Lorelai Gilmore. Sorry I'm late.

395
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,231
Please, you haven't missed a thing.

396
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,401
So far, we had coffee,
debated Carolyn Masters' nose job.

397
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:53,944
- Too pug.
- Too smushed.

398
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,572
And we started arguing
about our fall fundraiser.

399
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,115
I suggested we take a break.

400
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:01,368
I ignored the suggestion.
And now here we are. You're up to date.

401
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,661
Have a seat.

402
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,956
Lorelai Gilmore. You're Emily's daughter.

403
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,499
Yeah. You know my mother?

404
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,294
Very well. We're on
the Philharmonic Committee together.

405
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,963
- She told me to keep an eye out for you.
- That's nice.

406
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,923
She wasn't sure you'd show up.

407
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,467
So, fall fundraiser. What do we do?

408
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,512
Last year, we had the usual luncheon
with the silent auction...

409
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,056
- and a salsa band.
- A terrific salsa band.

410
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,351
But every guest ended up in the hospital
with food poisoning...

411
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,021
before the auction started,
and we wound up losing money.

412
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,356
- Whoops.
- Yes, it's quite a whoops, isn't it?

413
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,692
This year, we've decided
to do a fashion show.

414
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,068
That sounds fun.

415
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:38,155
- Well, Aubrey here works at Saks.
- Used to work at Saks.

416
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,032
Sorry. Used to work at Saks.

417
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,576
She got several designers
to donate their clothes.

418
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,746
Now we're just trying to find
a suitable caterer and location...

419
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,832
- and someone to plan the event.
- It's all going very well.

420
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,628
- I still say we approach Chateau Memsie.
- That space is too small, Mena.

421
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,671
How about something
more young and fun?

422
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,216
- You know my stepdaughter, Kimberly...
- Sarah?

423
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,926
Right, Sarah.

424
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,012
Anyhow, she told me
about this new club called The Digs...

425
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,849
She's been married a month and can't
remember the names of her stepchildren.

426
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,977
...so the booths are in these pits,
and there's sand everywhere...

427
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,020
Stop her.

428
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,981
I don't think that's exactly
what we're looking for.

429
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,399
I run an inn.

430
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,651
- You do?
- Which one?

431
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,861
The Independence Inn. It's in Stars Hollow.

432
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,072
I've been there. It's lovely.

433
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:24,576
We have a terrific chef who's never once
hospitalized an entire function.

434
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:29,456
I don't know exactly what you're looking
for, but we do functions there all the time.

435
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,834
- Who's your function coordinator?
- I am, actually.

436
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,419
Since it's for charity,
I could get you a good price.

437
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:37,589
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask.
Are you from heaven?

438
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,259
- You like the idea?
- I love the idea.

439
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:44,847
I love it so much, we can finally
take that break Aubrey's been dying for.

440
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,058
Well, this is very exciting.

441
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,228
Mind if I come out there tomorrow
to take a look at the place?

442
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,148
- Make sure it's big enough for the runway.
- Yeah, sure. I'll be there all day.

443
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:58,360
So, a fashion show, huh?
Are we gonna get any famous models?

444
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,404
- Excuse me?
- To model the clothes.

445
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,990
Any chance I'll finally see Kate Moss
eat something?

446
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,368
- No, we're the models.
- We? Who's we?

447
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,912
We. The women in this room. Me, you. We.

448
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,289
- Me?
- Yes.

449
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:14,543
By the way, welcome to the Boosters.
We're thrilled to have you.

450
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,461
Thanks. That's great.

451
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,633
Yours is worse than mine.

452
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,178
They totally just snuck
that modeling thing in.

453
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,679
My mom's a model.

454
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,473
Maybe I'll get to date
Leonardo DiCaprio now.

455
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:31,018
Plus, now I have to plan
the whole stupid thing.

456
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:34,229
Lorelai Gilmore.
Nope, doesn't sound model-y enough.

457
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:37,357
You need something that stands out more.
How about Waffle?

458
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,776
We could call you that
and say you're from Belgium.

459
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,029
I'm crabby.
I need to do something about it.

460
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,322
- Hey, Mom.
- Hello.

461
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,449
I went to my first Booster meeting
last night.

462
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,326
- Did Bitty tell you?
- No, she did not.

463
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:51,330
Maybe she's still stuck under that desk.
You might wanna send someone out there.

464
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,874
It's nice to hear
you're finally getting involved.

465
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:58,295
Yes. In fact, we're planning
a charity fashion show next weekend...

466
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,174
- and I volunteered to organize it.
- Well, good for you.

467
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:06,136
Since I know how concerned you are
about how Rory's perceived at Chilton...

468
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,306
I knew you'd want to be involved,
so you're one of the models.

469
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:11,767
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, so it's next Saturday.

470
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,895
Be there at 4:00,
and we'll provide hair and makeup.

471
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,856
- You can't be serious.
- We'll need your measurements, also.

472
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,274
This is ridiculous.

473
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,818
You said you wanted me to be involved.
I'm involved.

474
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,863
Don't you want to do your part
to ensure Rory's future?

475
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:27,074
- All right.
- Start measuring.

476
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,869
- You feel better now?
- Waffle's very happy.

477
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,755
Sit with us, please.

478
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:44,842
Okay.

479
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:50,055
Here she is.

480
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,140
Welcome.

481
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:55,686
- We talked. We find you fascinating.
- Like the monkey habitat.

482
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,938
So we've decided
to extend an invite to you.

483
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:02,234
- You can eat here anytime you like.
- Wow. That's nice of you. Thanks.

484
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:06,321
- Can I ask about this whole sorority thing?
- Pardon?

485
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:08,907
- Sorori-what?
- I thought you guys...

486
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,577
- We've no idea what you're talking about.
- Right.

487
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,038
After all, what's the point
of a secret society if it's not a secret?

488
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,249
The whole school apparently
knows about it.

489
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,002
No one has proof. It's just folklore.

490
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,921
- Like Snow White and Rose Red.
- Or Mariah Carey's crackup.

491
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,715
Have you heard her fan message recently?

492
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:27,885
She's fine and is currently staring
at a really beautiful rainbow.

493
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,595
Survivor, hello.

494
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,724
- Friend of yours?
- Paris? Oh, well...

495
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,559
- Too intense.
- Way too intense.

496
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,854
- She comes from a long line of us, though.
- I hate nepotism.

497
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,898
It, however,
does make the world go round.

498
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:45,027
You know, Paris, while, yes,
a little intense...

499
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,486
is also very smart.

500
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,073
I drop a box of matches on the floor,
she can tell me how many there are?

501
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:53,619
She's editor of the paper,
amazing writer, plus funny.

502
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,955
- She's funny?
- Yeah, hilarious.

503
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:00,083
I mean, the times
that we have spent laughing together...

504
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,628
I tell you, she's a regular Gary Mule Deer.

505
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,339
She asked you to talk her up, didn't she?

506
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,508
- No, not at all.
- Right.

507
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:11,303
Really. I think she's actually thinking
of joining another non-existent group.

508
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,931
- What?
- But her family's fully Puffed.

509
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:17,476
Don't know. Maybe I heard wrong.
But I think that's what I heard her say.

510
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:18,894
A voluntary defector.

511
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,646
- Francie...
- I know.

512
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,149
- Paris?
- Yeah?

513
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:27,110
I think the wall can hold itself up just fine,
don't you?

514
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:28,570
- What?
- You should sit.

515
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:29,988
- Sit?
- Here.

516
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,406
- Sit there?
- Or here.

517
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,450
Or anywhere, for that matter.

518
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:37,079
Unless you've got somewhere else to be.
Another table, perhaps?

519
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:38,121
Another table?

520
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,791
No, you have to sit right here. Come.

521
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:46,421
Okay. I guess I can sit.
For a little while, anyhow.

522
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:48,841
Okay. So...

523
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:52,052
- have we discussed homecoming yet?
- Not to my knowledge.

524
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:55,347
I believe the whole homecoming
dance ritual should be put to sleep.

525
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,476
In the dining room. And don't drip water
on the floor, please.

526
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:00,936
- Michel, did...
- Five minutes ago.

527
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,938
He brought the wrong color.
I sent him back.

528
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,398
- When will he...
- Twenty minutes...

529
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,316
or I'll hunt him down and shave his beard.

530
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,527
- Now we need...
- Yes, thanks for reminding me.

531
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,653
- Anything...
- No.

532
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:10,946
I'm going in the dining room.

533
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,365
Come and get me
if you need me to finish a sentence.

534
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,700
Will do.

535
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,833
- Hey, how's it coming?
- Working on it.

536
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,710
- This cannot tilt.
- I know this.

537
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,672
Women in heels will be walking on it.
Make it not tilt.

538
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,383
- The lettuce is dry.
- What does that mean?

539
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:34,011
- How attached are you to salad?
- It's free to see anyone.

540
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,721
I won't make a salad with dry lettuce.

541
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,055
- What's the alternative?
- Soup.

542
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,182
- Fine.
- Okay, great.

543
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,391
- Sookie?
- Yeah?

544
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,768
- Did we pay for the lettuce already?
- Yes.

545
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,396
- See if you can put it in the soup.
- Gotcha.

546
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,733
- Thank God. You brought Bert.
- Right here.

547
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,109
My men. Follow me.

548
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:52,946
You do tell people that you're the one
that named my toolbox, right?

549
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,865
- Toolbox. Dirty.
- Oh, jeez.

550
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,325
- Okay, move.
- What?

551
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:59,077
- I want Luke to look at it.
- I put this thing together.

552
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,290
Yes. And I loved your work in Pisa.
Now get out of the way, please.

553
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:07,544
- Okay, so what seems to be the problem?
- The problem... That's not funny.

554
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,505
I like it when you're stressed.

555
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:12,382
- Man, he put this up all wrong.
- Can you can fix it?

556
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:14,259
- I don't know. I'll see.
- You can fix it.

557
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,428
Say it all you want, it doesn't make it true.

558
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:18,722
- You can fix it.
- Not with you hovering, I can't.

559
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:21,099
Okay, I'm leaving. And you can fix it.

560
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,437
Eva, hi.

561
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,940
- God! The place looks wonderful.
- Thank you.

562
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:31,276
Let me show you to the room
where we're all getting ready.

563
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,528
Fix it yet?

564
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:35,823
- The moron used the wrong supports.
- Please tell me you can fix it.

565
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:38,575
- If I told you I couldn't, would you accept?
- No.

566
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:40,285
- I can fix it.
- Thank you.

567
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,412
So, we're right back here.

568
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,206
Eva, the room's right back here.

569
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,626
- Him. There. Man with tools. Who is that?
- That's Luke.

570
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,127
- I like Luke.
- What?

571
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:51,964
He's adorable. And he looks strong.
Is he strong?

572
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,633
I don't think he's gonna be
in a sideshow anytime soon...

573
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,468
but he can get the lid off a pickle jar.

574
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,971
- Is he single?
- Well, yeah, he is single.

575
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:03,308
- What kind of women does he like?
- I don't know. The ones with heads.

576
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,687
You know, I don't really know
what Luke's taste in women is.

577
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:10,023
Why don't you just go in the back,
go to the right...

578
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:13,318
you'll find the dressing room.
I'll be there in a sec.

579
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,989
- Hi, Mom.
- The place isn't nearly done yet.

580
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,408
Why don't you just go in the back
and get ready?

581
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:20,951
See the clothes? What am I wearing?

582
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,120
I don't know.
I had them hang them in the room.

583
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:26,081
I hope they're not tasteless
or zebra-striped or spandex.

584
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,876
One good way to find out
is to go on back and take a peek.

585
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,878
- You have to get ready, too.
- In a sec.

586
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,672
If I'm doing this, you're doing this.
I mean it.

587
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,217
- You fixed it.
- Yep. For the time being.

588
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:40,012
But I'm gonna stick around
to make sure nothing happens.

589
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:41,930
- Okay.
- What?

590
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,640
- Don't want me to?
- I didn't say that.

591
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:46,018
- Any reason I shouldn't?
- It's fine.

592
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,603
Because I'm just doing this for you.

593
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,938
If this thing goes
and someone breaks their neck...

594
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:53,108
- Luke, stick around.
- All right, if you insist.

595
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:01,366
- Hey. Why aren't you dressed yet?
- I was waiting for you.

596
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,660
Oh, my God. You're a paranoid woman.

597
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:07,164
- I'm Emily Gilmore.
- Okay, here you go.

598
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,459
- Where's Lorelai Gilmore?
- Right here.

599
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:13,462
- You two are together.
- What?

600
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,672
- You're the mother-daughter team.
- No, I'm...

601
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,925
I have outfits
for one mother-daughter team.

602
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,802
Your names are on the outfits. You're it.

603
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:23,889
Oh, my God.

604
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,891
I want to welcome you here...

605
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,936
to the Chilton Booster Club's
Annual Fall Festival Fundraiser...

606
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,481
where all proceeds from the evening
go directly into the refurbishing...

607
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,233
of the Chilton auditorium.

608
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,239
But enough about the kids.
Tonight is about us.

609
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,324
Without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen...

610
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,661
Saks presents a fabulous
fall fashion extravaganza.

611
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:01,028
Well, I must say this was definitely better
than the salsa band.

612
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,821
The people loved it. Did you hear them?

613
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:05,699
- God, who picked that music?
- That'd be me.

614
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,494
- The whole thing was terrific.
- Thank you.

615
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:12,164
And hiring that actor to play
a horrible, rude, annoying Frenchman...

616
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,791
- What a riot.
- Yeah, I thought that'd be fun.

617
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:18,712
If you'd plan all these things, we wouldn't
have any more stupid meetings.

618
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:22,758
Don't you want to see how long it takes
for Aubrey to finally learn that kid's name?

619
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:26,053
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I'll see you at the next meeting.

620
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:29,348
Great job.
Really, it's the best event we've ever had.

621
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,975
- Thanks, Ginger. Bye, Mena.
- Bye-bye.

622
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:38,857
- What are you looking so 'ha-ha' about?
- I'm not looking 'ha-ha. '

623
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,485
- Yes, you are.
- All right, whatever you say.

624
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,445
Come on, Mom. Fess up.

625
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,406
- Big success tonight.
- Seemed to be.

626
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:49,117
The ladies were thrilled. They adore you.

627
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,870
Yes, well, that's because I'm adorable.

628
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:53,956
- Funny, isn't it?
- What's funny?

629
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,418
How nicely you seem to be fitting
into the world that you ran away from.

630
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:04,049
Good night, Lorelai. Congratulations.

631
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,068
- Is that you?
- Nope.

632
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,779
- How was it?
- Fine.

633
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,699
It ran smoothly,
and the food was amazing.

634
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:32,161
- Michel only made three people cry.
- How was the fashion show?

635
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:35,080
I walked up and down the ramp,
looked pouty and sexy...

636
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:36,707
and now I'm ready for rehab.

637
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,877
- I brought you some Booster cake.
- Put it in the fridge, please.

638
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:40,919
Okay.

639
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:43,505
- How's Grandma?
- Good.

640
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,842
I assume that's your piece of cake
and mine is safe in the fridge.

641
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,093
You're cute.

642
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:51,221
- So, what'd you wear?
- Look at the time. I'm going to bed.

643
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:54,391
- Nobody took a picture of you?
- No. Can you believe that?

644
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,895
- You're holding on tightly to that purse.
- I really love this purse.

645
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,438
You have pictures in there.

646
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,815
- You calling your mother a liar?
- Yes, I am.

647
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,984
That's why I ate your cake.

648
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,406
- Oh, my God!
- Be nice.

649
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,409
- You look like Nancy Reagan.
- Now, how is that nice?

650
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,869
I don't believe this.

651
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:17,122
You look so completely different.
Elegant, understated.

652
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:20,459
I was wearing underwear with propellers
if that makes you feel better.

653
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,837
- I'm going to bed.
- I'll send the Secret Service up.

654
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:27,633
By the way,
I would put on your good pajamas...

655
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,469
the cute ones with the cakes on them,
and brush your hair...

656
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,138
- and put on a little lip gloss.
- Why?

657
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:36,934
- You're being kidnapped tonight.
- Excuse me?

658
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:40,562
- I got a call today from Francie.
- What?

659
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:43,857
She said she and her friends
would come in while you're sleeping...

660
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:47,319
wake you up, kidnap you, and take
you out to breakfast in your pajamas.

661
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:48,737
Why would they do that?

662
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:51,532
- Apparently, it's fun.
- That doesn't sound fun.

663
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:54,493
Told me to leave the key under the mat
and money on the table.

664
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:56,078
And you said yes to this insanity?

665
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:58,622
I told you not to become a soc,
but you didn't listen.

666
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:02,000
I can't believe you'd let some strange girls
come traipsing in...

667
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:05,170
and take away your only child,
your precious baby girl...

668
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:07,548
off to God knows where
in the middle of the night.

669
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:10,592
If it's someplace with doughnuts,
bring me one, okay?

670
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:12,886
- Hey!
- Christmas cards.

671
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,848
More like your grandmother every day.

672
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:26,191
- Mom, my kidnappers are here.
- Okay, have fun.

673
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:42,708
- Get the light.
- I can't find it.

674
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,377
Surprise!

675
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:48,255
- What's going on?
- Rise and shine.

676
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:50,048
You can grab shoes but no socks.

677
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:53,677
Wow, this is totally unexpected.
I'm completely surprised.

678
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,845
You looked it.

679
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:58,515
Okay, let's move.
We still got a couple more girls to get.

680
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:06,190
So, that's how you look
when you've just woken up?

681
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:08,066
Yeah.

682
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,778
Nothing in my life is fair.

683
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,409
Okay, a little further.

684
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,872
Sorry.

685
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,085
Okay, that's far enough.

686
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:31,215
Ladies, here on this spot,
tonight in this place...

687
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,842
where so many others
have come before you...

688
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:37,596
- we invite you to join us.
- Ladies, remove your blindfolds.

689
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,975
- We're at Chilton.
- Keys, please.

690
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:45,270
- What are we doing at Chilton?
- Be quiet. We're being Puffed.

691
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:48,273
What you're about to do and say
will remain forever...

692
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:52,110
between the members of the Puffs,
and only the members of the Puffs.

693
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,869
This is the headmaster's office.
How did she get the keys?

694
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,412
I'm sure he didn't give them to her.

695
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,791
Stop it. We are making
very important social contacts here.

696
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:08,919
I'm not looking for social contacts.
I have friends. I'm fine.

697
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:13,048
How nice it must be to be you. Maybe
someday I'll stumble into a Disney movie...

698
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:14,842
and be transported into your body.

699
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:17,761
After living there awhile,
I'll realize the beauty of myself.

700
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:21,098
But until that moment,
I'm going to go in there and become a Puff.

701
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,016
Now get out of my way.

702
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:44,621
The historical bell of Chilton,
120 years old.

703
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:48,083
Every member of the Puffs has stood here,
under the cover of night...

704
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,794
to pledge her lifelong devotion to us.

705
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:54,882
I pledge myself to the Puffs.
Loyal I will always be.

706
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:57,634
A 'P' to start, two 'F's' at the end...

707
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,262
and a 'U' sitting in between.

708
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:02,639
Anne Sexton, right?

709
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:06,101
Once you've finished your oath,
you will ring the bell three times.

710
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:07,561
- Rory?
- Yeah?

711
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,104
You first.

712
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:19,990
- I pledge myself to the Puffs.
- You have to hold the candle.

713
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:26,038
I pledge myself to the Puffs.
Loyal I'll always be.

714
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:27,664
Sing out, Louise.

715
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:31,376
A 'P' to start, two 'F's' at the end,
and a 'U' sitting in between.

716
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:35,214
I wouldn't do that again, Ms. Gilmore.

717
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:41,970
Disappointment, disillusionment,
frustration, astonishment.

718
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:45,307
I suppose you could say
I am experiencing all of these emotions.

719
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,726
Finding some of Chilton's
best and brightest...

720
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:50,729
acting in such a destructive, immoral,
and illegal manner...

721
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,606
will make all of us think long and hard...

722
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,900
about the manner
in which we're educating you.

723
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:58,821
But that is all in the future.
How do we handle this now?

724
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:01,448
Well, suspension will be considered.

725
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:05,035
Detention and extra credit
to maintain your current GPA standing...

726
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:07,204
- will be a given.
- This is unbelievable.

727
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,623
- What was that, Ms. Gilmore?
- Nothing.

728
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,626
I heard you mumbling something
in a rather disgruntled tone.

729
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:16,213
- I'd like to know what it was.
- I said, 'This is unbelievable. '

730
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,215
And why is this unbelievable?

731
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,384
I didn't even want to be here
in the first place.

732
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,760
Now, Ms. Gilmore...

733
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,762
Things were going fine.
My grades were good.

734
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,806
I joined the paper. My routine was down.

735
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:28,934
- Your routine was...
- I have friends. I have a steady boyfriend.

736
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,644
My mother and I are freakishly linked.

737
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,771
Lane and I are best friends
since kindergarten.

738
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,857
But you don't see it
'cause I don't live here.

739
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,900
If you don't see it, then it mustn't be true.

740
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:39,570
You call me to lecture me
because I'd rather read...

741
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:41,697
than discuss
the euthanasia of homecoming.

742
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,739
Your reading...

743
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:45,534
You told me and my mom
I needed to socialize. If I didn't...

744
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:48,245
it would be frowned upon
and hurt me getting into Harvard.

745
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:50,664
- Yes, we did say that.
- So I did it.

746
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:53,584
- I sat down at a table, a random table.
- Random?

747
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:57,754
The next thing I know, I'm being pulled out
of my bed at midnight and I'm blindfolded.

748
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,133
Before I know it, I end up here
with the Ya-Ya Sisterhood...

749
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,427
reciting poetry and lighting candles.

750
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:06,972
Now I'm gonna be suspended because
I was trying to do what you told me?

751
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:08,056
What's fair about that?

752
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,851
Headmaster Charleston,
the parents are starting to arrive.

753
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,060
Thank you, Mrs. Traiger.

754
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:16,273
We'll continue this conversation tomorrow
and for many days after that.

755
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,442
You may go. Ms. Gilmore.

756
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:22,279
I think that maybe you and I
should talk some more.

757
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:23,739
About what?

758
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:28,452
About the fact that though I do feel
it is important that students socialize...

759
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:33,165
possibly we may have been
a little hasty to judge in your case.

760
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:37,544
Really? So does that mean
that you might reconsider my suspension?

761
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:40,339
You're an excellent student.
You deserve to go to Harvard.

762
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:42,841
I wouldn't want to stand
in the way of that.

763
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,511
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Thank you.

764
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,564
What happened?
The reception on the phone sucked.

765
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:00,275
All I heard was 'Rory,' 'Chilton,'
and 'Get down here. '

766
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,527
Who's butt do I have to kick?

767
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,654
- We didn't go to breakfast.
- What's this about?

768
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:07,199
We came here, broke into the
headmaster's office as the big initiation.

769
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:10,327
- Those stupid girls.
- Part of the initiation was ringing a bell.

770
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,080
That's what I was doing
when security came. They called you.

771
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,040
You got busted for ringing a bell?

772
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:17,084
- That's it? Bell ringing?
- Yes.

773
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:20,128
- Were you at least smoking a Cuban cigar?
- Mom.

774
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:21,797
No. I mean, 'Bad girl.

775
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,007
'How many times
have I said not to ring bells?

776
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,885
'They can dent or scratch,
and they make dogs crazy.

777
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,720
'Think you're
the Hunchback of Notre Dame?

778
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,890
- 'Are you French? Circular? No. '
- I'm walking to the car now.

779
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:35,853
Hold on. How much trouble are you in?
Should I go talk to the headmaster?

780
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:39,147
- No, I think it's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

781
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:44,486
Was it a big bell at least?

782
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,828
- Good party yesterday.
- Yeah, not bad.

783
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,122
Yeah, I liked the new look.

784
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:58,709
- It was very high-class substitute teacher.
- Exactly what I was going for.

785
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,335
- Coffee?
- To go.

786
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:01,503
Okay.

787
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:08,051
Luke, I feel a little weird
even mentioning this to you.

788
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,971
- What?
- Yesterday, I saw you talking to Eva.

789
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:14,057
- She's in my Booster Club.
- Yeah, I know who she is.

790
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,309
Well, good.

791
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:18,812
So anyhow, I saw you guys talking alone,
and it seemed kind of private.

792
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:22,900
And she mentioned earlier
that you didn't make her, you know, gag.

793
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,861
So I just figured you guys
were making plans to hang out.

794
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:29,239
And, see, the thing is,
I just think it would be a little weird...

795
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,825
if you started dating a Chilton mom.

796
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:35,412
Look, I know I have no right
to say anything to you, but it's just...

797
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:36,788
If you did date her...

798
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,875
I'm in the Booster Club with her,
which means I'll hear things.

799
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,418
I don't know, it's just...

800
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,088
I'd like to keep that Chilton life
separate from my Stars Hollow life.

801
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,467
So if there's any way
that you could not date her...

802
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,886
that would be really great.

803
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,640
- Boy, I tell you, you've got nerve.
- Okay.

804
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,893
- I know this is your private business.
- It is my private business.

805
00:41:57,976 --> 00:41:59,728
You don't see any validity to my side?

806
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,105
I'm a grown man.
You can't tell me who to date.

807
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:04,525
I'm not telling you who to date,
but who not to date.

808
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:05,943
You can't tell me that either.

809
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:09,530
I will date who I like, and if that
screws with your plans, then sorry.

810
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,532
If you don't wanna hear things,
don't listen.

811
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:13,367
If you don't like it, just deal with it.

812
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,619
- Okay, I'll just deal with it.
- Good.

813
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:18,956
I just thought if something
was going to affect our friendship...

814
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:20,332
that you might care about that.

815
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:24,253
Because if the situation was reversed,
then I would care. But, hey, that's me.

816
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,839
So go ahead. Date her, marry her.

817
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:29,508
Make her Mrs. Backwards Baseball Cap.

818
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:32,469
Live happily ever after. See if I care.

819
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:35,222
And by the way, I wasn't asking her out.

820
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:38,225
I was giving her directions
for the quickest way to Hartford.

821
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,351
It was very romantic.

822
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:43,355
I said, 'You take a right at Deerfield
and catch the I-5 and take it south. '

823
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,107
Oh, man, hot stuff.

824
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,194
- That is so typical of you.
- What?

825
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:52,239
That is not the quickest way
back to Hartford.

826
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:54,950
Everybody knows you take
Maine to Cherry to Linwood...

827
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:57,494
and then grab the I-11.
Everybody knows that, Luke.

828
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:59,872
Everybody, apparently, but you.

829
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:29,818
- Do you mind?
- No.

830
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:31,361
Thanks.

831
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:21,870
