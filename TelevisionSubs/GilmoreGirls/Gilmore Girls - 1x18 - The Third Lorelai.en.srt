1
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:07,382
Everyone's awfully quiet tonight.

2
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:09,717
- Sorry, Mom, I'm just tired.
- Me, too.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,051
- School.
- Work.

4
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:12,715
- Life.
- Dig it, man.

5
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:15,420
- Peace out, Humphrey.
- Mystery.

6
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:24,099
This is ridiculous. Three intelligent women
sitting here in complete silence.

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:26,466
There must be something to talk about.

8
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:28,630
Do you know that every night at dinner...

9
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:31,937
the Kennedy clan would sit
around the table having lively debates...

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,805
about everything under the sun?

11
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:36,401
They would quiz each other
about current events...

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,947
historical facts, and intellectual trivia.

13
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:42,143
The Gilmore clan is just as smart
and worldly as the Kennedys.

14
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:45,812
So, come on, somebody say something.

15
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:50,185
Do you know that a butt model
makes $10,000 a day?

16
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:52,722
Camelot is truly dead.

17
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:56,693
- Emily.
- In here. Just follow the crickets.

18
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:01,067
I am sorry I'm late,
but I come bearing wonderful news.

19
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:02,863
Siri, bring Mr. Gilmore a plate.

20
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,426
I just got off the phone.

21
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:07,200
- Would you like to change first?
- No, I'm fine.

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,603
Siri, Mr. Gilmore's hungry.

23
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:12,673
I'm perfectly capable
of putting a napkin on my lap.

24
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:14,269
All right, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:16,280
- You were on the phone.
- Long distance.

26
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:17,473
- God?
- London.

27
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,846
- God lives in London?
- My mom lives in London.

28
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:22,511
Your mother is God? So, God is a woman.

29
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,645
And a relative. That's so cool.
I'm gonna ask for favors.

30
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:28,623
- Make her stop.
- Oh, that I could.

31
00:01:28,693 --> 00:01:32,025
- You spoke with your mother.
- Yes. She's fine and sends her love...

32
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:34,927
- and she's coming to visit.
- What?

33
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:36,328
- You're kidding.
- When?

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,061
- I'm gonna get to meet my great-grandma?
- Lorelai I.

35
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:40,966
- I was named after her.
- I figured.

36
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:44,266
- Richard, when?
- You'll love her. My mother's brilliant.

37
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,773
- We share that also.
- I'm asking a question here.

38
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:49,571
Does no one hear me?
Am I suddenly invisible?

39
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm sorry. What was the question?

40
00:01:51,513 --> 00:01:54,606
- When is your mother arriving?
- A week from today.

41
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:57,673
- Rory, I tell you, it'll be such a treat.
- Excuse me.

42
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:00,151
I still can't get over
that I'm related to God.

43
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,552
It's going to make
getting Madonna tickets so much easier.

44
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:01,464
Mom.

45
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:06,006
It's just like that woman,
no warnings, no discussion...

46
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:08,205
then out of the blue,
'I'm coming next week. '

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,009
- What are you doing?
- I have to unpack all these things.

48
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,572
What things? Excuse me, boys.

49
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,210
I have to get out everything
she has ever given us.

50
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:19,985
Thirty-five years' worth of fish lamps
and dog statues, lion tables...

51
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:23,284
and stupid naked angels with their butts!

52
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:26,989
Stupid naked angel butts?
What, did David Mamet just stop by?

53
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:28,963
- Leave, please.
- Mom, calm down.

54
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:32,558
I can't calm down! That lampshade
is missing, and the china is cracked.

55
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:36,036
I can't remember which table
she gave us for our 10-year anniversary.

56
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,935
Mother, Grandma is a very old woman.

57
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:40,668
I doubt she'll remember everything
she ever bought you.

58
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:43,734
She'll remember down
to the last shrimp fork. You know why?

59
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:46,575
- No. Do you know why?
- She doesn't just give you a present.

60
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:49,013
She gives you one,
then tells you where to put it...

61
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:51,483
how to use it, what it costs,
for insurance purposes.

62
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:55,385
God forbid if you have a different opinion
or don't think it works in the space.

63
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:59,084
Or you get tired of waking up every day
with those animals staring at you!

64
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,092
- She's just upset.
- Stop talking to the dogs!

65
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:05,061
You're freaking out.
I've never seen you freak out before.

66
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:08,497
Yes, you have. You were 12.
It was the last time that woman visited.

67
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,659
- Do you want some help?
- No.

68
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,198
Please.

69
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:17,574
- Where's it going?
- Third floor.

70
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:20,041
- How about the second floor?
- Third floor.

71
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,600
The first floor, on a ladder?

72
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:25,706
- So tell me more about her.
- I don't really know that much.

73
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,749
You know more than I do.

74
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:31,515
Let's see.
She moved to London when Grandpa died.

75
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:33,244
But she didn't like to travel.

76
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:36,189
So once a year
Mom and Dad would go to visit her...

77
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:39,488
usually leaving me behind,
much to my relief, by the way.

78
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:42,257
That's it.
The rest I know from stories, just like you.

79
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:44,389
Grandpa says I remind him of her.

80
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:49,060
That is the biggest compliment that can
be wrenched out of Grumpy McFarlane.

81
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,997
- I hope she likes me.
- She'll love you.

82
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:56,004
- I hope she and Grandma get along.
- She'll love you.

83
00:04:57,544 --> 00:05:00,944
I think the basic structure
of the Elizabethan government is sound.

84
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:03,776
The division of power between
the Monarchy, Privy Council...

85
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,782
and the Parliament all seem to work.
Agreed?

86
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:06,908
- Agreed.
- Ditto.

87
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:09,146
Okay, so in establishing
our own government...

88
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,813
I think duplicating a similar structure
would be good...

89
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,052
with a few alterations.
Queen Elizabeth chose to remain unwed.

90
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:16,922
She took on the burden of leadership...

91
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:20,156
at a time when marrying
the Prince of France or the King of Spain...

92
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,891
would've solidified her throne
while expanding her empire.

93
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:24,399
Though it worked for her...

94
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:28,028
and the concept of a woman ruling
without man is politically correct...

95
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:30,037
I think we need to take a different tact.

96
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:32,369
She does know
this is a make-believe government?

97
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:34,102
You ask her, I'm afraid.

98
00:05:34,177 --> 00:05:36,838
In addition to the members
of the political branches...

99
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:38,674
we'll also need a king and queen.

100
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:40,941
Rory, Tristan, what about you?

101
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:42,942
Us? No.

102
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:44,415
- Yes, no.
- Why?

103
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:46,645
- Because...
- I just don't want to be queen.

104
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,051
Me neither.

105
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:49,918
King. I don't want to be king.

106
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:51,480
What about you? You be queen.

107
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,856
I'll be the head of parliament.
I can't be queen.

108
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,325
- Be both.
- I can't be both.

109
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:56,656
Why not? It's our government.

110
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,220
- It's not done that way.
- It can be though, let's vote.

111
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:02,597
Henry VllI started a new church
when the old one didn't allow divorce.

112
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:05,261
He also cut his wife's head.
Is he still your role model?

113
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:09,136
I'm just saying we have the opportunity
to make any kind of government we want.

114
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:10,935
- Why won't you be queen?
- I'll be queen.

115
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,239
- There, make Madeline queen.
- Fine. You're queen, Tristan's king.

116
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:15,778
I'll be the lady in waiting...

117
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:19,009
the one with that low-cut,
blue-velvet Renaissance dress.

118
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,208
Lady in waiting is not a political office.

119
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:23,751
No, but they get all the sex.

120
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:26,950
- What?
- Watch a movie.

121
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:29,718
We are talking about government class.
Not the movies.

122
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:32,817
Why can't I get one person
to care about this as much as I do?

123
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:36,022
Okay, fine. I'll be the head
of the quarter sessions court...

124
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:38,360
but I'm still wearing the dress. Happy?

125
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:39,956
Out of my mind.

126
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:43,161
Okay. I secured us the classroom
to work tomorrow and Sunday...

127
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:44,898
so that by Monday, we'll be ready.

128
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,166
- We're working all weekend?
- You're kidding.

129
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,970
Take this.
It's an outline for the overall system.

130
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:53,843
Point of methods, basic laws
and penalties, plus some random ideas.

131
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,406
Please be ready to discuss it tomorrow,
9:00 in the morning. Don't be late.

132
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,945
She designed the flag.

133
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,746
- Question?
- Okay.

134
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:08,291
- What's up with you and Tristan?
- What do you mean?

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,294
- You seem weird around each other.
- No weirder than usual.

136
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:12,953
- I disagree.
- You usually do.

137
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,623
I think it's strange
that you didn't want to be queen.

138
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,997
You know,
not all girls want to be queen, Paris.

139
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:21,696
- Even Barbie ended up being a stewardess.
- Okay, if you say so.

140
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:24,230
Read my manifesto. I want your thoughts.

141
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:26,399
First thought: Lose the word 'manifesto. '

142
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:28,875
- Too cabin-in-the-woods?
- Don't open your mail.

143
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:31,537
- Right. How about 'doctrine'?
- Better.

144
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:33,974
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

145
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:43,751
- You left this.
- Oh, yeah, I did. Thanks.

146
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:45,682
Sure.

147
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:51,988
That could have been
a potential Marx brothers moment.

148
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,827
- You go first.
- Okay.

149
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:58,965
- I think we need to talk.
- About what?

150
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,767
- Tristan, you know about what.
- No, I don't.

151
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:04,265
Look, we have a lot of work ahead of us.

152
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:07,333
We also have two and a half years
of being in the same school.

153
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:09,709
I don't want things to be weird
between us.

154
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,944
Don't you think it would be good
to at least try to talk about this?

155
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,382
- Okay.
- Good.

156
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:21,322
- I'm gonna go first.
- Right.

157
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,152
- It's still not working.
- You did something wrong.

158
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:29,356
No. I did the same thing I always do
when I pull up reservations...

159
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:31,364
for the upcoming month,
but nothing happened.

160
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:32,797
- You typed in the name?
- Yes.

161
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,562
- You clicked on the April file?
- Yes.

162
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:37,195
- You double-clicked on 'Confirmation'?
- I double-clicked.

163
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:39,101
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I double-clicked.

164
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,470
- You clicked twice?
- No, I didn't click twice.

165
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:44,009
To successfully double-click,
you must click twice.

166
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:45,374
I know what double-click is.

167
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:47,969
You don't, or we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

168
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:49,570
I'm gonna pinch you so hard now.

169
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:51,878
I don't know what you have done.

170
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,350
I can't fix it if you don't move.

171
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:56,010
I double-clicked.

172
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:57,247
- What's that?
- What?

173
00:08:57,322 --> 00:08:59,687
- That red thing with an 'X.'
- I do not know.

174
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:01,952
It happened when you pushed
something funky.

175
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:03,720
I push nothing funky.

176
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:05,989
You have the funk, my friend.

177
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,029
- Independence Inn.
- I need the hatrack.

178
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,000
- The fish flies at night.
- What?

179
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,361
- I don't know. Who is this?
- Your mother.

180
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,463
Hi, Mom, I didn't recognize your voice.

181
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,441
- I need the hatrack back.
- What hatrack?

182
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:22,499
- The hatrack I gave you.
- What hatrack?

183
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:24,977
The hatrack I gave you for Christmas
five years ago.

184
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:26,673
Well...

185
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:30,479
It's large, bronze with dragons or weasels,
I don't know.

186
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:33,179
Some sort of lizard-type animal
you hang your coats on.

187
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:35,949
- Yes, I remember it.
- Thank God. I need it back.

188
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,752
You need a Christmas present back?

189
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,553
- Temporarily.
- Why, Mom?

190
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:43,254
Because Richard's mother gave it to us,
and she'll notice if it's not there.

191
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,695
You gave me a used present?

192
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,493
No, we never used it.

193
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,296
- I can't believe it.
- You'll get it back.

194
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:54,634
You gave me a secondhand present,
like something you got at the junk store.

195
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:56,935
You're being dramatic.
It was still in the crate.

196
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:59,567
You actually went,
'What should I get Lorelai this year?

197
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:01,235
'You know what? I can't be bothered.

198
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:03,109
'Let's give her something we don't want. '

199
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,875
- You're not funny.
- What would Miss Manners say to this?

200
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,849
If she met your grandma,
she'd understand.

201
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:11,284
Now, please. Bring the rack with you
when you come tonight. Okay?

202
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:13,184
- Okay, sure.
- Thank you.

203
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,189
You're welcome. Bye.

204
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:21,329
- So, we're supposed to talk.
- Yeah. Look, about the other night...

205
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:24,990
- I was upset over Summer.
- Yes, and I was upset over Dean.

206
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,796
So, then it doesn't mean anything, right?

207
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,029
Right.

208
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:33,002
So then, that's it.
We just chalk it up to a bad night.

209
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:34,165
Okay.

210
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:36,736
I'm sorry I cried.

211
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:40,074
- No problem.
- I swear it had nothing to do with the kiss.

212
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:43,114
I kissed you, you cried.
It had something to do with the kiss.

213
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:46,879
I cried because I was confused,
and because I hadn't cried.

214
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:49,685
I didn't cry because of the kiss.

215
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:51,683
It was a nice kiss.

216
00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:53,087
- Yeah?
- Very nice.

217
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:55,591
- Not at all crying material.
- Really?

218
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,093
- Absolutely.
- Want to try it again?

219
00:10:58,263 --> 00:11:01,322
I think someone is recovering
from their heartbreak just fine.

220
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,195
Yeah, I'm all better.

221
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:06,094
I think I'm gonna swear off girls
for a while.

222
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:08,369
- What?
- Sorry, nothing.

223
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:11,201
You said you were going to swear off girls.
It's funny.

224
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:14,004
- You don't think I can?
- No. I think you can.

225
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:16,270
I just think it would be hard for you.

226
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:19,108
It'd probably involve
some kind of lockup facility...

227
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:21,171
and one of those Hannibal Lecter masks.

228
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,648
Okay, yes, it would be hard,
but not impossible.

229
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:26,709
Maybe it's not so much
swearing off all girls.

230
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:30,152
- But swearing off a certain kind of girl.
- Meaning?

231
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:34,386
Meaning next time you should pick a girl
with a little more substance.

232
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:38,624
You know, a girl who's smart,
is driven and has ambition.

233
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,828
You know, like Paris.

234
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,060
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, why not?

235
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,968
Paris is smart and cute and interesting.

236
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,402
She does bring her own
unique set of baggage into the mix.

237
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:50,735
A matching set.

238
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:54,642
But she likes you. She's crazy about you.
She thinks you're amazing.

239
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,875
- You want me to date Paris?
- Just think about it.

240
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,516
Me and Paris.

241
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:04,612
'Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a wonderful friendship. '

242
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:06,917
- Who's Louis?
- Just think.

243
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:16,388
- Come on, let's go!
- Relax. I'm almost ready.

244
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:19,258
- We're gonna be late.
- No, we're not.

245
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:21,859
It's Friday night.
The traffic's bad on Friday night.

246
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:23,960
- Since when?
- Since the beginning of time.

247
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:25,026
Let me do it.

248
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:26,402
- What's up with you?
- Nothing.

249
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:28,805
You've been ready and bugging me
for almost an hour.

250
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:32,003
Usually I have to drag you
kicking and screaming to go to dinner.

251
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,638
- You whine, complain and act like a child.
- I do not.

252
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:37,512
I had to pay you $5 once
so you wouldn't go in sweats.

253
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:41,246
Make your point and make it fast
as we move quickly to the front door.

254
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,549
- My point is that you're mean.
- I'm not mean.

255
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:47,057
You want to go to dinner to see
Grandma uncomfortable. That's mean.

256
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,113
Okay, look.

257
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:50,285
I will admit I work very hard...

258
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:53,524
and sometimes I am a little tired
come Friday night...

259
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:56,725
for the Gilmore family dinner.
But I had a light day today...

260
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,768
and my grandmother,
who I haven't seen in years, will be there.

261
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:02,703
It has nothing to do
with Grandma hating Great-grandma?

262
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:05,297
- Not at all.
- When you see Grandma miserable...

263
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,535
and uncomfortable, you'll be sympathetic?

264
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,008
- Not at all.
- Mean.

265
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,704
- I'm kidding.
- I want you to be nice.

266
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,509
- I will be nice.
- No outward reveling in someone's pain.

267
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:15,549
- I promise.
- Internal reveling only.

268
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:18,016
- Okay. Then we can go.
- Okay. Good.

269
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:19,377
Wait.

270
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:23,221
So the internal reveling can continue
for years to come.

271
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,381
Mean.

272
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,530
Mean.

273
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:41,836
God, this thing weighs like 1,000 pounds.

274
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:43,897
I know. Here, put it down.

275
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:45,735
What are we doing?

276
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:48,676
- In case Gran comes to the door.
- Good thinking.

277
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,407
I mean, she's 80.
The eyes have got to be gone, right?

278
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:55,110
- Let's just try to keep her inside the house.
- Good thinking.

279
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:57,278
- Do you have it?
- We got it.

280
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:00,247
Hurry up. Bring it in here.

281
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:03,385
Okay, quiet. Be quiet.

282
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,452
Mom, thanks for the direction and all,
but we need some help.

283
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,729
- Careful, honey.
- Watch it. Watch your head.

284
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,064
Get it over there. Okay. Yes.

285
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:17,035
I think that was...
It was maybe a little more on the left.

286
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:18,298
I should've put tape down.

287
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:20,431
You don't think the coatrack
could've moved...

288
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:22,168
a quarter of an inch in five years?

289
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:25,870
Yeah, you're right. That's it.
Okay, put your coats on it.

290
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:29,038
How'd you get her in here
without her noticing it wasn't there?

291
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:32,084
I brought her in through the back
and had Stella wax the floors.

292
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:33,947
She napped, so that took about an hour.

293
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,884
- Where is she now?
- In the living room...

294
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:39,048
scratching the diamond pendant
I bought her against a mirror.

295
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,254
- So we shouldn't keep her waiting?
- No, you're right, we shouldn't.

296
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:45,051
Heaven help me.

297
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:46,955
Stop.

298
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,325
- Mom, look who's here.
- Who?

299
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,095
Well, look.

300
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,934
If I wanted to look, I would look.
I haven't looked.

301
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,974
Therefore, you must draw
your own conclusions.

302
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,734
- Thank you, dear boy.
- You're welcome, Trix.

303
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:04,972
- Trix?
- Dad's pet name for Gran.

304
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:06,514
Isn't it just darling?

305
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:08,572
- Hi, Gran.
- Lorelai.

306
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,640
Yes. It's so good to see you again.

307
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:13,152
Trix, this is Rory. You haven't met her yet.

308
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,451
No, I don't believe I have.

309
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,046
- Hello.
- Come.

310
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,449
I want to get a very good look
at both of you.

311
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,155
- They're tall.
- Yes, they are.

312
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:26,821
- How's your health?
- Good.

313
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,957
Very healthy.

314
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:31,469
Good, that means the majority
of your blood is Gilmore blood.

315
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:34,972
- Gilmores don't get sick. Am I right?
- We wouldn't dare, Trix.

316
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,303
That's right. Your mother is always sick.

317
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:40,276
- I am hardly always sick.
- You're sick right now.

318
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:41,902
- Are you sick now?
- Headache.

319
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,039
Gilmore's don't have headaches.
Our heads are perfect.

320
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:46,446
You don't drink.

321
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:49,651
- Emily, get this woman a drink.
- I'll do it.

322
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,346
Thanks, Dad. White wine.

323
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:53,786
I'm going to get the hors d'oeuvres.

324
00:15:53,857 --> 00:15:55,448
So, you're Rory.

325
00:15:55,926 --> 00:15:58,894
- Yes, ma'am.
- My son speaks of you constantly.

326
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:00,722
He seems very fond of you.

327
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:02,820
I'm very fond of him, too.

328
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:07,592
This little girl is as smart as a whip.
I think she has a great deal of you in her.

329
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,295
Really? How nice.

330
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:12,695
- Is this cheese?
- Yes, it is.

331
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,105
Am I supposed to eat that cheese?

332
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:16,233
Only if you like.

333
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,675
Where are those spiced nuts
that Trix likes?

334
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:20,042
I'll get some.

335
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:23,173
So, Lorelai, since I've seen you last,
you've grown up...

336
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,443
gotten pregnant out of wedlock...

337
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:29,112
raised a child, and still haven't bothered
to get married.

338
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,646
Have I left anything out?

339
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,188
Some time in between growing up
and getting pregnant...

340
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,749
I got my ears pierced.

341
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,294
I've always hated scandal.

342
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:41,559
However, I've always appreciated
self-sufficiency.

343
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:43,924
Tell me, how do you support this child?

344
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:45,297
I run an inn.

345
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:47,302
- Hard work?
- Yes, it is.

346
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:50,430
Good. Hard work is good for a woman.
Makes her stronger.

347
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:52,838
I admire people who enjoy hard work.

348
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:55,706
- Here we go. Spiced nuts.
- Thank you, Emily.

349
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,041
I suppose I could just put these nuts
in my hand.

350
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:01,543
I'll be right back.

351
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,846
So, Gran, when was the last time
I saw you?

352
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,480
You were still in your teens,
wild hair flying everywhere.

353
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:10,250
I see you've taken care of that.

354
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:12,758
Yes, I joined a support group,
bought a brush...

355
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:15,090
and just taking it one day at a time.

356
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,356
- That was a joke?
- Yes, it is.

357
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,123
- Very good.
- Thank you.

358
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,996
- I have dishes and napkins.
- Good for you.

359
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:25,465
Richard, I would like to be escorted
into the dining room now.

360
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:27,471
Your wish is my command.

361
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:31,568
I'm not sure that dinner's ready just yet.

362
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:34,771
Perhaps our presence in the dining room
will teach your help...

363
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:38,747
that when one is told dinner is at 7:00,
people often expect dinner at 7:00.

364
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:41,808
- But it's only 7:05, Mom.
- Only 7:05?

365
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,684
In the event that I'm kidnapped...

366
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:47,188
and ransom is demanded
at a certain time...

367
00:17:47,258 --> 00:17:50,954
I would prefer that Emily not be in charge
of the drop-off.

368
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:05,001
Grandma, this dinner's delicious.

369
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:08,564
Very good, young lady.
We all believed you.

370
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:11,407
Now, let's talk about your education.

371
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:13,537
- Where are you attending school?
- Chilton.

372
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:17,344
- Rory is in the top 10% of her class.
- We're very proud of our Rory.

373
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:18,849
She's going to Harvard.

374
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:20,350
- Harvard?
- Yes, ma'am.

375
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,979
Richard, how can you allow this girl
to go to Harvard?

376
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:25,580
- Now, Trix...
- You and your father were Yale men.

377
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:28,387
We want Rory to be whatever kind of man
she wants to be.

378
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,984
- That's enough jokes for this evening.
- Sorry.

379
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:33,087
Now, if you don't mind my asking.

380
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:35,654
Chilton is rather an expensive institution.

381
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:39,532
I'm curious how the manager of an inn
can afford such luxury?

382
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:42,237
We're helping Lorelai out a little.

383
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:45,274
Yes, we've seen to it
that Rory's education is taken care of.

384
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:47,104
But it's temporary. It's a loan.

385
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:50,145
I plan to pay them back every cent.
They know this.

386
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:52,446
That's it. I'm done. Richard.

387
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:54,948
Tomorrow, Rory, I shall plan the menu.

388
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:58,315
When you've lived in Europe,
you learn a thing or two about food.

389
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,650
I can't. I'm studying tomorrow.

390
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,690
I'm in this study group
and our presentation is due on Monday.

391
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,351
Very well, your mother can tell you
all about it.

392
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:08,088
I will. I promise.

393
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:09,526
Won't you have dessert?

394
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:12,462
I once traveled to a small village
in Cambodia.

395
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:15,057
I did not eat dessert there, either.

396
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:22,298
What time is it?

397
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,106
It's almost 9:00.

398
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:27,805
Maybe I'll own a magazine some day.
Then I'll get all my nail polish free.

399
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:29,539
I'm going back to sleep.

400
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:31,808
- Tell Paris I hate her.
- Okay.

401
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:34,613
- Hi.
- Hey, Paris. Louise hates you.

402
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:37,152
You'll thank me
when you get into Sarah Lawrence.

403
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:38,812
- Wanna bet?
- Hey.

404
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:42,551
- Did you bring coffee?
- And doughnuts in the shape of clowns.

405
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,390
- They've got hats.
- A clown just isn't a clown without a hat.

406
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,760
- Here is your decaf with soy milk.
- Thanks.

407
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:50,924
You're welcome. So I read your doctrine...

408
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:53,728
and I think our imaginary kingdom
is off to a good start.

409
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:56,361
- Yeah?
- Yeah. The taxes are a little high...

410
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:58,905
and the landowner's power
should be regulated more.

411
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:00,531
It was a different time then.

412
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:02,768
But the fundamental human needs
were the same.

413
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:05,403
- We're supposed to set it up within...
- Ding, ding.

414
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,470
No debating until I've had coffee.

415
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:08,946
And a clown?

416
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,011
- Ladies.
- Hi, Tristan.

417
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:15,316
- Paris, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure. Okay.

418
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:21,991
And that is about what, pray tell?

419
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:25,723
- I don't know. The project maybe?
- They could have talked project here.

420
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:28,162
It's something else, something private.

421
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:31,030
- Scandal.
- Maybe, though it is Paris.

422
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:33,998
- Scandal lite.
- All the taste, but fewer calories.

423
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:35,367
We could spy.

424
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:38,566
We could wait for her to come back
to see if she wants us to know.

425
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,802
Those who wait
for information to find them...

426
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:42,902
spend a lot of time sitting by the phone.

427
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:46,470
Those who find it themselves
have something to say when it rings.

428
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,913
- Nietzsche?
- Dawson.

429
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:49,473
My next guess.

430
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:54,419
- What was with the confab in the hallway?
- We're dying here.

431
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,651
Well, Tristan asked me out.

432
00:20:57,826 --> 00:21:00,055
- No!
- My, my, my.

433
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:02,524
This is amazing. God, I'm jealous.

434
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,392
Details. Don't leave out anything.

435
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:06,728
We want every comma, apostrophe,
and ampersand.

436
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,597
He just asked me out.

437
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,224
- When?
- Tonight.

438
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,995
- What?
- Nothing.

439
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,068
- No, you 'hmmed. ' Why did you 'hmm'?
- Forget it.

440
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,904
Louise, tell me why.

441
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,873
- He asked you out for tonight.
- Less than 24 hours' notice.

442
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,848
- So? What does that mean?
- Usually that someone else canceled.

443
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,316
Or maybe he just got up the nerve
to ask her out.

444
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,376
- Maybe.
- This is so amazing.

445
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,514
- You are so far from Tristan's type.
- So far.

446
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,523
Tristan usually likes his girls bad.

447
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:37,991
We'll have to do
a Pink Ladies makeover on you.

448
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:40,824
We'll turn you from a sweet Sandy
into a slutty Sandy...

449
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:44,388
dancing at the school fair in high heels,
black spandex, and permed hair.

450
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,525
- You can borrow my water bra.
- Excuse me?

451
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:51,265
It's like a padded bra, but it's filled
with some sort of liquid so it moves.

452
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:52,703
- It moves?
- Yes.

453
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:55,241
- On its own?
- It makes you look natural.

454
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,938
Great. Thanks, but I'll pass.
Everybody, come on. Let's get to work.

455
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:01,037
I think you're gonna have a great time.

456
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:03,911
- Yeah, it's just a date, right?
- Great.

457
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:06,081
Okay, focus, people.

458
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,457
Five-minute talking break while I change.

459
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:23,157
My day: Big leak, third floor,
lots of things going squish...

460
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:25,759
that should not be squishing.
Michel is no help.

461
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:28,464
I'm late for dinner
which I'm bugged you're not coming to.

462
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,529
- Which one? Blue, black, bad, good?
- Black.

463
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:33,303
- Okay. Are you sure you can't come?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

464
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:36,243
If I'm not prepared tomorrow,
Paris will send me to the Tower.

465
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:38,802
If things go well tonight,
I bet it'll help tomorrow.

466
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:40,906
- Tonight?
- She's going on a date with Tristan.

467
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,780
- How'd that happen?
- Did some matchmaking.

468
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:46,287
How many times have I told you
not to butt into other people's business?

469
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:47,616
- Never.
- Good. Go on.

470
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:49,622
- That's all.
- I want details tomorrow.

471
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:51,715
- How do I look?
- Beautiful.

472
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,853
My five minutes are up. Let's go!

473
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:58,525
There is money on the kitchen table.

474
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,931
There's really good chocolate cake
I defrosted for you this morning.

475
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:04,492
Call me if you need me.
I'll be home early. What else?

476
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:06,765
- Don't be mean to Grandma.
- Yeah, broken record.

477
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,329
- Okay, I'm gone.
- Be good.

478
00:23:08,408 --> 00:23:09,806
- Bye!
- Bye.

479
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:28,618
- I don't know what to wear.
- Ever?

480
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:31,091
On my date with Tristan.
I'm not a trendy girl.

481
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,425
I don't haunt the boutiques
hoping to find that fabulous little top.

482
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,057
I study, I think about studying,
then I study some more.

483
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:39,123
- Wanna come in?
- I only have one lipstick...

484
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:40,565
and it's barely even a color.

485
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:43,900
It looks like you're not wearing anything,
which is why I liked it.

486
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:47,931
But to date, you need the fabulous top
and a lipstick you can tell you're wearing.

487
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,475
You wanna put that stuff down?

488
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:52,239
You said if I needed to talk,
I could come talk to you.

489
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,712
- Yes, I did.
- Here I am.

490
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,407
- Can I ask you a question?
- Okay.

491
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:59,349
Why didn't you go to Madeline or Louise?
They'd get that 'fabulous top' thing.

492
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,614
That they get.
The supportive 'you'll be fine...

493
00:24:01,688 --> 00:24:04,713
'and not throw up on the way
to his car'thing, that they don't get.

494
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,257
Okay. Let's see what you've got.

495
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:10,557
I brought everything in case there was
hidden potential in something I didn't see.

496
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:12,959
- So?
- You'd be one well-dressed widow.

497
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:15,328
- Forget it. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are. Come on.

498
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,027
This is your entire wardrobe?
Nothing's left at home?

499
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:21,833
Just my uniform and my bat mitzvah dress
with menorahs on the collar.

500
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:23,338
Let's think.

501
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:25,301
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

502
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:27,673
To our one-stop shopping store.

503
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:31,913
- This is your mother's room?
- Yes, it is.

504
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:35,439
- I can't wear your mother's clothes.
- You can. I do it all the time.

505
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:36,643
What about this?

506
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:39,152
My mother says pink
makes my head look small.

507
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:40,278
Okay. No pink.

508
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:42,118
- This whole thing is insane.
- Why?

509
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,351
Tristan asking me out.
Why would he do that?

510
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:45,449
Why not?

511
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:49,359
He's gorgeous and experienced
and only dates likely trophy wives.

512
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,659
He would be lucky to go out
with someone like you.

513
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,529
He won't have to read the menu to you...

514
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,035
or explain that the dancing trash bins
in the movie previews aren't real.

515
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:58,627
It's gonna be much less stressful.

516
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,797
All these years
I've hoped this would happen...

517
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,738
and now it has, and I feel...

518
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,034
I don't know.

519
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,839
I don't have a lot of experience
in the dating department.

520
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:09,379
You can't put it on your transcript,
what's the point?

521
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:10,641
I know.

522
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:13,512
Before Dean, I'd never had a boyfriend.
Or a kiss.

523
00:25:14,452 --> 00:25:16,043
I never even thought about dating.

524
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:17,348
- Then you met Dean.
- Yeah.

525
00:25:17,422 --> 00:25:21,721
And he was so special and nice
and made me completely nauseous.

526
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,752
- The best ones do.
- I couldn't even talk around him.

527
00:25:24,828 --> 00:25:28,024
I saw you at the dance. You didn't seem
to have any trouble talking.

528
00:25:28,097 --> 00:25:30,257
Or gazing annoyingly
into each other's eyes.

529
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,357
But that was after
we'd been dating a little.

530
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:35,301
After we started going out
and spending time together...

531
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:37,235
it kind of got easier.

532
00:25:37,673 --> 00:25:40,072
Then by the third date,
everything was perfect.

533
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:41,608
Do you miss him a lot?

534
00:25:41,677 --> 00:25:43,473
Yeah, a lot.

535
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:45,269
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

536
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,540
But tonight is not about me.

537
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:51,345
Tonight is about you
going out with Tristan in this outfit.

538
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,144
- What do you think?
- It's okay.

539
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:56,719
- It's great.
- Put it on.

540
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,984
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, bathroom's down the hall.

541
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,425
I'll get you a lipstick
with some actual color in it.

542
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,972
Paris, what are these cards
that fell out of your jacket?

543
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,906
Those are notes for tonight.

544
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:22,535
- Notes?
- Yeah, just some reference points.

545
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:25,171
Subjects to bring up
in case the conversation lags.

546
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:28,705
Can I suggest that you leave this one
about the Spanish Inquisition out?

547
00:26:28,784 --> 00:26:30,546
- Not very romantic?
- Not really.

548
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:32,176
Okay, I'm dressed.

549
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:33,743
- How's it look?
- Bad.

550
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:36,689
I don't trust your opinion on that.
Come out here, please.

551
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,623
Fine, but it looks bad.

552
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:40,854
- You look great!
- I feel weird.

553
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:42,953
Weird works for you
because you look amazing.

554
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:45,624
- Really? You're not just saying that?
- I swear to God.

555
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,030
- Are you atheist?
- Excuse me?

556
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,295
It affects the validity
of your swearing to God.

557
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:51,700
You look great.
I wouldn't say that if you didn't.

558
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:54,740
- Lf you think it looks okay...
- The word 'amazing' was used.

559
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:56,831
- Then I'll wear it. Thanks.
- Anytime.

560
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,739
- I have to go.
- Lipstick.

561
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:02,611
You'll hold this evening
over my head for the rest of my life?

562
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:04,239
- Probably.
- Bye.

563
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:14,589
- What did you think about the rabbit?
- I thought it was wonderful.

564
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:15,988
I brought it with me.

565
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,890
- Excuse me?
- From London.

566
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:19,986
London has the best game.

567
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,326
- You brought it with you from London?
- Yes.

568
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:24,592
- Did you get it a seat?
- Dry ice.

569
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:28,568
- That's inventive.
- It looks like we're finished here.

570
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,432
Let's retire to the living room for a brandy.

571
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,572
Lorelai, walk with me.

572
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:37,941
I have something
that I want to discuss with you.

573
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:40,705
I've been thinking
about something I heard.

574
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:41,839
What?

575
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:45,009
That you borrowed money
from your parents for Rory's school.

576
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:47,645
If you're worried about them getting
the money back...

577
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:51,156
Shakespeare once wrote,
'Neither a borrower nor a lender be. '

578
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,282
Do you consider Shakespeare a wise man?

579
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,485
Sure.

580
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,617
We certainly don't mind loaning Lorelai
the money...

581
00:27:57,696 --> 00:28:00,289
- if that's what you're worried about.
- Certainly not.

582
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:02,925
Rory is first priority in this house.

583
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:05,629
I'm not concerned about
whether you mind or not.

584
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:08,102
Loaning money is a dirty business.

585
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:11,039
It's distasteful, and I don't care for it.

586
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:14,306
As you know, I came into town...

587
00:28:14,578 --> 00:28:17,978
to check up on the family investments
and to talk with our lawyers.

588
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,844
I have some things to put in order...

589
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:23,249
and one of them
is setting up a trust fund for Rory.

590
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,619
- That's amazing. Really?
- Now, normally...

591
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:30,852
I would set up a fund so that she would
have access to it when she turns 25.

592
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:34,053
However, considering the situation,
if you like...

593
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,653
- I will arrange for her to get it now.
- Now?

594
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:40,065
That way, she can use it to pay for Chilton.

595
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:44,697
Gran, I don't know what to say.
That's so generous of you.

596
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:46,864
My mother is a very special woman,
isn't she?

597
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,429
You talk about me like I'm dead.

598
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:50,737
You're never going to die.
You're too stubborn.

599
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,333
Gran, this is...

600
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:53,969
I don't know what to say.

601
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:56,037
Nothing now would be preferable.

602
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:59,480
I have arranged for you and your mother
and I to have tea tomorrow...

603
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:01,677
before I leave. Say it then.

604
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,714
Good night, Emily.

605
00:29:04,555 --> 00:29:05,680
Good night.

606
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:08,883
I'll just walk Mother upstairs
and be right back.

607
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:14,124
That was quite a bomb she just dropped.

608
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:16,191
It certainly was.

609
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:19,926
I guess I should be going.
Thanks for dinner, Mom.

610
00:29:20,003 --> 00:29:21,902
I'll see you tomorrow.

611
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:33,008
You're not considering
accepting that money, are you?

612
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:35,776
- Of course I'm considering it.
- I don't think that's wise.

613
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,544
- Why not?
- Because she's a young girl.

614
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:39,449
She won't know
the first thing about money.

615
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,542
I'll help her.

616
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,815
You don't know
the first thing about money either.

617
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,618
But I'm familiar with the second thing.

618
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:47,420
Can't you see the pitfalls involved
in accepting this money?

619
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:50,427
You brag about how special
your relationship with Rory is.

620
00:29:50,496 --> 00:29:52,486
I'm stunned that you want to jeopardize it.

621
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:55,761
- What are you talking about?
- You know that money means freedom.

622
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,324
- And?
- Lf Rory has that money...

623
00:29:57,402 --> 00:29:58,891
she won't need you anymore.

624
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,698
I don't know, she's 16.

625
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:03,899
There's still some ways I may
come in handy, buying beer and stuff.

626
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:06,169
I'm glad you think
losing your daughter is funny.

627
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:09,609
She won't need you to pay for anything,
she won't have to turn to you.

628
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,909
Everything in a relationship
isn't about money.

629
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:14,006
- She'll move out as soon as she can.
- So what?

630
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:16,880
She won't need your help for college
or to buy a car.

631
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:20,615
Say goodbye to Dad for me as soon as
the voices in your head subside.

632
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,180
Why should she wait
to backpack across Europe with you?

633
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:26,784
She can afford to go herself,
and she can take a friend or a boyfriend.

634
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:28,761
She wants to go with me.

635
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,854
Now she does. She doesn't have options.

636
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:33,195
- But the minute you give her options...
- That's it.

637
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:36,133
You're nuts, and I'm going. In that order.

638
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:40,339
It's terrible not to be needed. You'll see.

639
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,499
- That is amazing!
- I know.

640
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:54,004
One minute it's, 'Pass the pot roast. '
Then it's, 'Have a pile of money. '

641
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:56,039
Things are never boring
at the Gilmore house.

642
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:57,131
What did Rory say?

643
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,469
- I haven't told her yet.
- What?

644
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,442
- She was asleep.
- For that much money, you wake her up.

645
00:32:01,512 --> 00:32:04,105
You hire singing telegrams,
women jump out of cakes.

646
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:06,808
People dress like bankers
and dance with those toasters.

647
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,079
She's been working her butt off all week
on this Chilton paper...

648
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:12,882
- so I let her sleep. I'll tell her tonight.
- Call her now.

649
00:32:12,956 --> 00:32:14,547
Or page her and have her call me...

650
00:32:14,623 --> 00:32:17,989
and we can sing The Money Song
from Cabaret. You be Liza, I'll be Joel.

651
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,424
- I don't know.
- I'm Joel.

652
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:21,519
I don't wanna bother her at school.

653
00:32:21,597 --> 00:32:24,588
I can never decide.
Carnations: Tacky or retro?

654
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:27,792
- You don't wanna tell her.
- Yeah, I do. I think.

655
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,334
I understand the hesitation.

656
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:31,735
- You do?
- Absolutely.

657
00:32:31,805 --> 00:32:36,070
Who wants to be the bearer of good news?
That hugging and happiness, a nightmare.

658
00:32:36,143 --> 00:32:40,135
I was thrilled when Gran told me about it
and I was gonna tell Rory right away.

659
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:43,045
- But?
- My mother cornered me by the door...

660
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:46,240
saying all this stuff about
how when Rory gets the money...

661
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:49,252
she's not gonna need me,
and she's gonna move out sooner.

662
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,083
- What? That's crazy.
- I know, and yet...

663
00:32:52,157 --> 00:32:55,455
Honey, come on. She's trying to mess
with your mind, you know that.

664
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:57,619
- I do.
- She doesn't wanna lose control of you.

665
00:32:57,695 --> 00:32:59,559
She wants you
permanently obligated to her.

666
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,927
- I know that.
- Then what?

667
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:04,432
- Do you believe what she said?
- I don't know.

668
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:07,264
You're right,
she wants to mess with my mind...

669
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:08,927
and make me feel obligated.

670
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:12,064
But what if the money
does change our relationship?

671
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:13,767
- Impossible.
- Anything's possible.

672
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:16,003
- Come on.
- I couldn't stand that.

673
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,772
I like things the way they are now.

674
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:20,473
- This is Rory we're talking about.
- I know.

675
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:22,880
She's the most unmaterialistic kid
in the world.

676
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:24,383
It's not about what she would buy.

677
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:28,217
I don't care if she buys a house, or a boat,
or the Elephant Man's bones.

678
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:31,382
It's just that...
You know, it's about the freedom.

679
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:33,756
If I had access to all that money as a kid...

680
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:35,851
I would've left the house so fast.

681
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:37,828
- Faster than 17?
- No, I mean...

682
00:33:37,897 --> 00:33:41,161
God, I know this is crazy. I have
my mom's voice stuck in my head.

683
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:45,396
It's like that annoying Cranberries song.
I hate that I let her get to me.

684
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:47,836
Then don't let her. Call Rory and tell her.

685
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:50,066
You'll see that nothing will be
any different.

686
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:53,109
I don't want her to go to Europe
without me. That's our thing.

687
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:55,474
She's not gonna go without you.
I promise.

688
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:00,015
- No. I've got to go home.
- Why? What are you doing?

689
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:03,779
I have to change and go to tea
with Gran and the cast of Gaslight.

690
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:06,145
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

691
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:09,582
I can't talk to you when you're hysterical.

692
00:34:09,658 --> 00:34:12,785
- You make me hysterical.
- I am tired of fighting about this.

693
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:15,352
You have got to get her
to take that offer back.

694
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:18,126
Richard Gilmore,
I've put up with a lot from this woman.

695
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,256
Keep your voice down.

696
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:21,324
- But this time she's gone too far!
- Please.

697
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:22,425
I can go louder!

698
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:25,063
If I do as you ask,
I'll be insulting my mother.

699
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,299
- I will not do that.
- You listen to me.

700
00:34:27,374 --> 00:34:29,967
I don't care if she demeans me
and looks down on me.

701
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:32,840
I don't care if she thinks
I've tarnished the Gilmore name.

702
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:35,345
I don't care if she thinks
I'm the Whore of Babylon.

703
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:39,611
I've long ago given up any hope
of getting into her psychotic good graces.

704
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:43,120
But that woman is horrible and selfish.
She cannot get away with this.

705
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:45,485
- I won't let her.
- You're talking about my mother.

706
00:34:45,557 --> 00:34:49,287
Yes. Your mother, the one who stepped in
without being asked...

707
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:52,056
and single-handedly wrecked everything.

708
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,894
What is this about?

709
00:34:58,102 --> 00:34:59,728
She'll never come back here.

710
00:34:59,802 --> 00:35:02,429
- Who, Mother? Of course she will.
- Lorelai.

711
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:03,630
What?

712
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:07,205
If she gets that money,
Lorelai will never come back here.

713
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:08,937
She won't have to.

714
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:13,244
I've ordered a car. Women shouldn't drive.

715
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:15,573
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

716
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,614
I shall die soon, you know.

717
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:31,027
Aren't we early?
Trying to suck up to parliament?

718
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:33,496
- How'd it go last night?
- It went.

719
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,824
- It went well?
- He picked me up...

720
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:38,698
we went to dinner and a movie,
I didn't use my notecards...

721
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:41,603
- and he kissed me good night.
- Paris, I'm so glad.

722
00:35:41,674 --> 00:35:43,140
It was a great kiss.

723
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,868
See? All that nervousness for nothing.

724
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:48,139
Yeah. God, this is so weird.
I can't stop smiling.

725
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,440
Then it's the perfect time
to talk about our overtaxed peasants.

726
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,607
- Let them eat cake.
- Hey.

727
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,249
Don't look at me. I didn't kiss you.

728
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:06,825
- Hi.
- Hey.

729
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:09,997
I wanted to tell you again
that I had so much fun last night.

730
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:12,123
After five messages
on my answering machine...

731
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,723
I kind of got that impression.

732
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:16,827
- Too much. Sorry.
- No, forget it. It was cute.

733
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:18,894
Maybe we could do it again sometime.

734
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:21,907
A different movie, of course,
but the same basic plan.

735
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:24,500
- Absolutely.
- Great, because it was really fun.

736
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:27,978
It was fun, and we should do it again.
I mean, as friends.

737
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:32,349
- Yeah, as friends.
- You noticed it, too, right?

738
00:36:32,418 --> 00:36:35,113
That we're more friends material
than dating material?

739
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:38,314
Yes, I did notice.
I have excellent deductive skills.

740
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,153
- But I'm glad we did it.
- Sure.

741
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:44,683
When Rory first suggested us going out,
I thought the idea was crazy.

742
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:47,491
But she made some good points.
We do have a history...

743
00:36:47,565 --> 00:36:50,931
- and you never know, right?
- Yes. You never know.

744
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:54,500
So we're done here, right?

745
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,606
- Sure.
- Great. Excuse me.

746
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:01,570
- What?
- It was your idea?

747
00:37:01,644 --> 00:37:04,612
So I get all your castoffs now?
I'm just that pathetic?

748
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,909
'I don't want them.
Maybe I can con the suckers...

749
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:09,541
'into taking out Paris the loser!
Throw the dog a bone!'

750
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:12,949
- I am not your charity case!
- No, it's not like that, I swear.

751
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:15,318
I just thought you guys
would make a good couple.

752
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,825
We did, for one night.
But we're more suited to being friends.

753
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:22,054
That's what was conveyed
so humiliatingly to me five seconds ago.

754
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:24,358
- Paris, I'm sorry.
- I hate you.

755
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,762
- You told her?
- I didn't know it was a secret.

756
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:34,998
Why would you tell her?
What is wrong with you?

757
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:37,666
Relax. We tried, it didn't work out.
It's no big deal.

758
00:37:37,742 --> 00:37:40,733
It's a huge deal to Paris,
and one date is not trying.

759
00:37:40,812 --> 00:37:42,210
You said you'd try.

760
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,679
I'm sorry if Paris is upset, okay?

761
00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:48,547
But is it better that I keep dating her
even though I like somebody else?

762
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:50,586
- Yeah.
- I didn't realize.

763
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:54,088
So, you're still not over Summer?

764
00:37:55,491 --> 00:37:57,720
Yeah, I'm not over Summer yet.

765
00:38:19,512 --> 00:38:20,910
- Hi.
- Hello.

766
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:22,841
Where's Gran?

767
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:25,247
Torturing the bathroom attendant,
I suppose.

768
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,717
This place seems clean.

769
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:34,250
Yes, it's famous for its cleanliness.

770
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:38,018
What did Rory say when you told her?
About the money, I mean.

771
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,723
- She must've been very excited.
- Yes, she was.

772
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:42,924
'Rose tea. ' That's funny.

773
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:47,732
That's not really tea, is it?
It's like rose petals in hot water.

774
00:38:47,804 --> 00:38:50,271
More like a bad floral arrangement.

775
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,399
- What did Rory say? Fill me in.
- She was happy.

776
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,868
Yeah. She screamed,
she did that air lasso thing over her head.

777
00:38:56,946 --> 00:38:58,310
Be serious.

778
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:01,945
She was asleep when I got home,
so I couldn't tell her.

779
00:39:02,016 --> 00:39:03,880
- She doesn't know?
- No.

780
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:08,550
Something I said must've really
struck a chord with you.

781
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:09,714
Excuse me?

782
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,314
You didn't tell her,
so you must've had a reason.

783
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,292
She was asleep. I just told you that.

784
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:17,625
I think you must have reconsidered
based on our conversation.

785
00:39:17,698 --> 00:39:18,823
I didn't reconsider.

786
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:22,264
Yesterday, you could hardly wait
to announce your great fortune to her.

787
00:39:22,335 --> 00:39:24,529
Today, all you can talk about
is rose petal tea.

788
00:39:24,604 --> 00:39:26,628
Yes, it's a little weird.

789
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:30,070
You haven't told her that now she has
her own money for school...

790
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:32,166
- and to go to Europe...
- Stop. Right now.

791
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,837
This is just like you,
to take something that's great...

792
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:37,847
and twist it into something ugly.
Why? What is wrong with you?

793
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:38,903
There's nothing wrong.

794
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:42,145
There's something seriously wrong
with you. You should be studied.

795
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:45,517
I don't understand why you're so upset.
I respect your decision.

796
00:39:45,588 --> 00:39:48,181
- I made no decision.
- Whatever you say.

797
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:53,227
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna call her and tell her right now.

798
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:55,819
- No, you're not.
- Yes, in fact, I am.

799
00:39:57,032 --> 00:39:59,727
- What are you doing?
- The reception sucks in here.

800
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:01,769
Stop it. You look like you're having a fit.

801
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:04,099
Okay, I'm gonna go find a payphone.

802
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:07,870
Your grandmother will be back
any second. Just have a sandwich.

803
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:09,272
Have a sandwich?

804
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:12,436
- That's what you have to say to me?
- What do you want me to say?

805
00:40:12,512 --> 00:40:15,969
Say that you are sorry you tried
to talk me out of taking this money...

806
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:19,040
that you realize you were being petty,
controlling and mean...

807
00:40:19,118 --> 00:40:22,951
and you know that no amount of money
can change what Rory and I have.

808
00:40:23,022 --> 00:40:25,785
- That's what I want you to say. Say that.
- I will not.

809
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,984
Say it or I'm finding a payphone.

810
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,484
- You're here.
- Hi, Gran.

811
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:34,053
- Have you ordered the tea yet?
- No, not yet.

812
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:37,123
Good, because I'm going to have
to take my leave of you...

813
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,430
a little earlier than I had anticipated.

814
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:40,560
What? Why?

815
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:44,037
My train leaves tonight, and I have
a little last-minute packing to do.

816
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:45,539
I can help you with that.

817
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:47,404
Plus, I really don't wish to witness...

818
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:50,809
any more of this ugly little fight
you two seem to be having.

819
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,440
Raising your voice during high tea.
Whoever heard of such a thing?

820
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:56,380
It's like Fergie all over again.

821
00:40:56,451 --> 00:41:00,750
Gran, please. I'm so sorry.
We're done. Please don't leave.

822
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:04,450
I can see now that offering
the trust fund was a bad idea.

823
00:41:04,758 --> 00:41:08,625
After all, taking into account
the maturity level of those involved...

824
00:41:08,696 --> 00:41:11,823
this large amount of money
would probably not be safe.

825
00:41:11,898 --> 00:41:15,560
No, that isn't true.
Rory is an incredibly mature kid.

826
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:18,602
I'm sure she is. It's you I'm worried about.

827
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:20,399
And I'm sure she gets it from you.

828
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:22,496
Tell Rory goodbye for me.

829
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:25,542
You two are welcome
to visit me in London anytime.

830
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:29,137
Emily, please get my coat.
I will meet you outside.

831
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:37,183
- You won.
- I did not win.

832
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,379
You didn't want me to take the money,
I'm not taking the money.

833
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,356
That's called winning.

834
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:44,852
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

835
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,493
Yes, I am.

836
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:53,527
- Forget it, Mom. It's no big deal.
- No, it is a big deal.

837
00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:56,934
Here Rory had this wonderful opportunity,
and we... And I...

838
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:01,397
- Maybe I can talk to her.
- Yes, that'll work.

839
00:42:02,443 --> 00:42:05,377
I'll go to your father. He can talk to her.

840
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:08,505
He can fix it. I'll make him fix it.

841
00:42:11,484 --> 00:42:13,348
Damn reception. I'll go to a payphone.

842
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:14,976
Mom, sit. Stay here.

843
00:42:15,054 --> 00:42:16,816
- But Chilton...
- Rory can still go...

844
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:18,651
unless you're rethinking our agreement.

845
00:42:18,724 --> 00:42:21,021
No, not at all.
I am not rethinking anything.

846
00:42:21,092 --> 00:42:22,991
Okay, then we're good.

847
00:42:23,228 --> 00:42:24,694
Are you sure?

848
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,461
We're good.

849
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,762
I'd better go out there
before she leaves me here.

850
00:42:31,835 --> 00:42:36,533
- I'm sure you'll be sorry to see her go.
- I don't know what I'll do with myself.

851
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:38,665
- See you Friday?
- See you Friday.

852
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:40,975
- Mom?
- Yes?

853
00:42:41,044 --> 00:42:44,035
- Can I ask you one favor?
- Anything at all.

854
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:47,274
Don't make us take the coat rack back.

855
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:49,508
Deal.

856
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:06,357
- Hi.
- Hey.

857
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:07,592
- Here.
- Thanks.

858
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,691
I thought you were gonna have tea today.

859
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:11,827
- We did. We finished.
- Finished early.

860
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:14,167
Once you're done
with those little sandwiches...

861
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,468
there's no reason to pretend
you like tea anymore.

862
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:18,338
I totally understand.

863
00:43:18,477 --> 00:43:20,341
There's something I have to tell you.

864
00:43:20,412 --> 00:43:21,469
What?

865
00:43:21,546 --> 00:43:23,069
I loaned Paris your black mini...

866
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:25,842
and there's a good chance
you may never see it again.

867
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:29,047
- There's something I have to tell you.
- What?

868
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,747
- You lost out on $250,000 today.
- What?
