1
00:00:00,241 --> 00:00:02,122
Previously on
"Gilmore girls"...

2
00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:03,390
I'm not going anywhere.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,864
This is it for me.
You're it for me.

4
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:07,723
I don't want to see
you get hurt again.

5
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:08,962
I am being careful.

6
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:10,104
You are leaving for London.

7
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:11,677
Who knows when we'll
see each other again.

8
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:13,244
What is the fun date?

9
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:14,512
No hints.

10
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:16,101
Ma'am, have you been drinking?

11
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:18,273
What? No!

12
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,871
We have to pick up
my mother from jail.

13
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:22,837
Your mother's in jail?

14
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,361
Oh, this night keeps
getting better and better.

15
00:00:25,376 --> 00:00:27,902
I can't wait to come see you, Logan.
I can't wait.

16
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,662
Tell your mom you're not
gonna be home for Christmas.

17
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,612
Christmas?

18
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:33,540
You finally got menace to society
Emily Gilmore off the street.

19
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:35,261
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

20
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:37,350
Come on. Put that thing away.

21
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,170
I'll call you tomorrow.

22
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:41,743
Want to come in?

23
00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:43,862
Yeah?

24
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:52,252
Okay. Toothbrush, hairbrush,
hypoallergenic pillow,

25
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:54,932
chenille blanket --
ooh, comfort shoes.

26
00:00:54,947 --> 00:00:56,992
- Got them.
- Those are your comfort shoes?

27
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:59,182
- Not mine -- Paul Anka's.
- We're staying in tonight.

28
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:00,932
You can probably
get away with flats.

29
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:02,671
He loves, loves,
loves chewing on these.

30
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:04,240
They remind him of
a squirrel carcass.

31
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:05,441
- Yummy.
- Don't judge.

32
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:07,432
You eat jerky like it's
going out of style.

33
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,853
So, all this stuff
is for Paul Anka?

34
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:11,632
No, not all.
The toothbrush is mine.

35
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:13,011
- Lorelai.
- What?

36
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,930
It's his first night
staying at your house.

37
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:17,652
I want him to have all the stuff
that makes him comfortable.

38
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:18,760
Ooh -- tennis balls!

39
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,432
I actually have tennis balls.

40
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:22,250
- Penn or Wilson?
- You're joking.

41
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,523
Paul Anka's must be Penn.

42
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:25,272
They must be new,
they must be green --

43
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,052
not orange and green,
just green.

44
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:30,090
And FYI, you might want to watch
that sarcastic tone of yours

45
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:32,011
because dogs are very
attuned to tone.

46
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,903
It's kind of like chinese,
in that respect, dog language.

47
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,143
It's very tone based.

48
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:38,501
And you are stressing him
out right now with your tone.

49
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,170
The dog is stressed?

50
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,403
Look at him.

51
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:42,841
And when he gets like this,

52
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:46,090
you need to talk to him in
sweet and dulcet tones.

53
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:50,072
Hi, Paul Anka.
Ooh, hi, boy! Hi!

54
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:51,500
- Get it?
- Got it.

55
00:01:51,518 --> 00:01:53,282
Good. Sunglasses.

56
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:56,792
This is not normal.
I want you to know that.

57
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:58,553
The dog wears Ferragamos?

58
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,611
Oh, please.
Don't give him any ideas.

59
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:01,563
These are mine.

60
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:03,543
All right, let's go.
You take this, this, and this.

61
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:05,522
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

62
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:15,592
Oops. Here, Paul Anka.

63
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:17,840
Hey.

64
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:19,292
- Hey, you watching it?
- What?

65
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:21,160
- The meteor shower.
- What meteor shower?

66
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:24,323
It was on the news. The BBC said
there's some huge meteor shower tonight.

67
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:25,452
I thought we could
watch it together.

68
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:28,391
Uh, Logan, I have been in the
library for the past nine hours.

69
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:29,880
I don't know anything
about any meteor showers.

70
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,693
I could use a regular
shower, though.

71
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,542
Go up on the roof
and check it out.

72
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,111
- Now?
- Yes, now!

73
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:36,910
It's supposed to start
in like two minutes.

74
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:40,040
Ace! This is once-in-a-lifetime
celestial event. Get going.

75
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:41,953
Okay, okay.
I'm getting. I'm going.

76
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,212
Are you running?

77
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:44,691
I'm  running! I'm running!

78
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,832
Who knew you were such
an astronomy buff?

79
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:47,721
Hurry!

80
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:49,381
What has gotten into you?

81
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:51,640
Nice night.

82
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,880
Oh, my god!

83
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:56,501
You're here!
What are you doing here?

84
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:58,711
Happy to see me?

85
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,943
Beyond happy! Ecstatic!

86
00:04:00,957 --> 00:04:02,621
I can't believe you're here!

87
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:04,562
And look at me --
I'm covered in highlighter ink

88
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,111
and I smell like
Fritos and Ginger ale.

89
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:08,263
It's an aphrodisiac.

90
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:10,153
You're here and
you did all this?

91
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,293
You like?

92
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:13,732
I love,
but you didn't have to do this.

93
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:16,573
I mean, you're here. It's enough.
It's more than enough.

94
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:18,872
Could you shut up now
so I can kiss you?

95
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:23,720
- So there is no meteor shower?
- No meteor shower.

96
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:25,772
So you used the entire
cosmos to trick me?

97
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,241
I like to think big.

98
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:30,491
So, what is going on?
Why are you here?

99
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:32,623
I'm kissing my
girlfriend on the roof.

100
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:35,742
But why?

101
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:38,862
The Fritos and Ginger ale thing.
I told you, huge turn-on.

102
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,032
Explain yourself.

103
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:43,472
I'm just here for a
quick business trip.

104
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:44,662
- How quick?
- Too quick.

105
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:45,903
How quick is "too quick"?

106
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,411
I have 10:00 flight back
to London tomorrow night.

107
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:49,902
Oh, that is too quick.

108
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,993
That website my team has
been trying to buy --

109
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:55,100
the owners finally agreed to sit down,
talk to us tomorrow over breakfast.

110
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:56,990
Logan! That's great, right?

111
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,970
I mean, three weeks ago,
they weren't even taking your calls.

112
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:01,323
It is great.
However, not as exciting

113
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:03,532
as kissing my
girlfriend on the roof.

114
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,492
- Um, so, what's that amazing smell?
- Food from Ibiza.

115
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:10,600
The island?

116
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:12,510
The tapas place downtown.

117
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:13,742
Ooh, did you get the duck?

118
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:14,890
I did.

119
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:17,630
- And the short ribs?
- Yes. And...

120
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:20,740
Ooh! A 2003 red something.

121
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:23,671
I bet it's very oaky and
corky and full of fruity legs.

122
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:24,752
Know a lot about wine, do you?

123
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:26,463
Not so much,
but the label's pretty.

124
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:29,671
There's also gazpacho, that
cheese-pie thing you love, plus flan.

125
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:31,643
Ooh, flan! You got me flan?

126
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:33,263
Doesn't take much to make you happy,
does it?

127
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,902
Not when you're on
this continent.

128
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,972
Okay, why don't you open this wine?
I want to taste those fruity legs,

129
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,472
and I'll make you a
plate with extra flan.

130
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,601
Okay.

131
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:46,100
Ooh, I'm so glad you're here!

132
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:54,270
Stop! You're killing my Tivo.

133
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:57,263
I'm  not killing it. I'm composing on it.
I'm composing a symphony.

134
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,091
- Finally, an instrument I can play.
- Give me that.

135
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:00,543
- No, no, no!
- Give me!

136
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:02,531
- Not until you explain your choices.
- What?

137
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:05,910
"The View"? "Girlfriends"?
"Sábado Gigante"?

138
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:08,473
Who controls this thing,
you or Pedro Almodóvar?

139
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:09,572
It's the nanny.

140
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:11,213
Sure, it's a likely story.

141
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:12,503
Give me, give me, give me.

142
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:13,923
Did G.G. get to sleep okay?

143
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:16,120
She did. I tried to skip to
the end of "Cinderella,"

144
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,613
but she wouldn't let me.
It's my own fault.

145
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,541
My wicked stepsister
voice kills.

146
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:21,337
She's amazing, you know?

147
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,951
That reminds me.

148
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:28,633
Oh, no! You're not gonna show
me some of her art, are you?

149
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:30,202
I never know what to
say in those situations.

150
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:32,281
I mean, even when it was Rory's art,
you know?

151
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:35,872
Three blue finger smudges
and some construction paper.

152
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:37,860
It's not precocious.
It's just messy.

153
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,960
Here. This came a
couple of days ago.

154
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,683
It's from Sherry.

155
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:42,883
From Sherry?

156
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:45,603
Yeah, it's the first I've heard from
her since the divorce was final.

157
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,032
Go ahead. Read it.

158
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:49,122
Wow, how "dangerous
liaisons" of her.

159
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,402
She  doesn't call.
She doesn't e-mail.

160
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:52,562
Then she sends you a
letter with a wax seal

161
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,990
that weighs roughly the
same as a porterhouse.

162
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:56,990
Well, she had a lot to say.

163
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:00,002
Gosh. It's a lot of sorry.

164
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:03,083
Yeah, 15 pages worth.
Believe me, I was not expecting this.

165
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:05,711
Humility is not a side of
Sherry I've ever seen before.

166
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,320
I don't know if it's the yoga
or the yoga instructor or --

167
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:10,512
Yoga instructor?

168
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:14,223
Yeah, she's dating her yoga instructor,
Jean-Claude or Jean-Pierre --

169
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:15,531
one of those names that
always sounds fake.

170
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,761
Anyway, it sounds like
she's really changed.

171
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:20,103
She feels awful about what happened,
run away like that,

172
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:22,511
and she wants to find a way to
be part of G.G.'s life again.

173
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,383
- Honey, that's great.
- Right?

174
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:25,841
Yeah.

175
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:28,722
So, you got this two days ago
and you're showing it to me now.

176
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:30,662
Well, I was gonna show it to
you a couple of days ago,

177
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:32,583
but then I figured you
were coming over, so...

178
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:34,293
- No, I'm not criticizing.
- You're not?

179
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:36,060
No, I'm complimenting --
badly, obviously.

180
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:38,682
But I'm complimenting.
You shared it with me.

181
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:41,910
I kind of thought that was how the
whole adult-relationship thing worked.

182
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,981
You know, openness, honesty.

183
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:44,882
Interesting.

184
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,642
And you're sure you don't want
to stash it away somewhere

185
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:50,010
and then I find it -- accidentally,
of course -- months from now,

186
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:52,740
and I get all weird and insecure about
why you didn't show it to me sooner?

187
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:53,923
I'm good with the sharing.

188
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:55,980
All right.
It's another way to go.

189
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:06,843
That glass slipper
will fit my foot.

190
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:09,001
That was my wicked
stepsister voice.

191
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:10,513
Yeah, I figured.

192
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:19,172
I'm so happy.

193
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,811
Me too.

194
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:23,773
You know you can't
do this in London?

195
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,721
The city lights are so bright,
you almost never see the stars.

196
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:28,802
Yeah, but it's London.

197
00:08:29,638 --> 00:08:31,930
Wait, are you tired of London?

198
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,173
I'm tired of not
being around you.

199
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:36,382
Yeah, but you can't
be tired of London.

200
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,133
Samuel Johnson said,
"when you're tired of London,

201
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,650
you're tired of life."

202
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:42,621
Obviously, the man was never in
a long-distance relationship.

203
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:46,063
That's true.
Boswell did keep quite close.

204
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:48,901
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

205
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,830
You're trying to sneak
a peek at my watch.

206
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:53,663
Well, I just can't believe it.
I can't believe you're here.

207
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:58,980
And I can't believe that you're leaving
in only 26 hours and 45 minutes.

208
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:01,731
Come on, think positive -- that's
an entire lifetime to a fruit fly.

209
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:03,231
Actually, you're
thinking of a mayfly.

210
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,462
Fruit flies can live for up to a month.
So what do you think?

211
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:06,620
Can you stay for a month?

212
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:08,963
I mean, what if your meeting
tomorrow goes really, really well?

213
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:09,961
I hope it does.

214
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:11,133
It will. It's a great idea.

215
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:12,610
It's basically myspace.

216
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,323
But by invitation only.

217
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,910
And it'll be like an online
version of the Algonquin Group,

218
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:18,051
like throwing a
party in your head

219
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:20,433
where everyone you've ever
wanted to talk to is there --

220
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:22,902
Ira Glass, Sofia Coppola,
Flaubert, Danger Mouse.

221
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,812
The deal's not done yet.
Far from it.

222
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,490
These guys aren't just gonna
hand over their website

223
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,921
because we buy them breakfast.

224
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:31,811
They might. Tell them that they
can order pancakes and eggs.

225
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:33,113
Don't make them choose.

226
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:36,351
Sausage, bacon, fruit, potatoes --
let them get the whole combo.

227
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,812
'Cause then they will have to sell
it to you. It'd be rude not to.

228
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,423
You are a business genius, Ace.

229
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:42,150
Well, I'm taking econ
with my grandpa.

230
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,173
Whatever happens,
we'll be ready.

231
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:47,131
We've been working our asses off on
this one -- Nick, Bobby, Phillip.

232
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:50,140
Oh, yes -- Phillip, Nick, Bobby.
The team. Starting lineup.

233
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,280
It is a classic win-win.
They give us a foothold in new media.

234
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,722
We give them a huge influx of capital,
which they need.

235
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:58,172
Believe me, when it comes to debt
versus equity, they're screwed.

236
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,752
They have no liquidity,
huge expenses, zero revenue.

237
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,321
I mean, the targeted
advertising potential alone --

238
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,913
What? What are you staring at?

239
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:07,392
You, "Mr. Debt Versus Equity."

240
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,120
- Are you mocking me?
- Yeah, but I like it.

241
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:13,770
Tell  me more about this um,
targeted advertising potential.

242
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:15,550
What do you want to know?
There's pay-per-click,

243
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:18,303
pay-per-lead, banner ads,
pixel tagging.

244
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:20,961
Oh, stop.
I'm getting weak at the knees.

245
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:25,793
Logan?

246
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:28,472
Shh. Go back to sleep.
It's only 6:00.

247
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:30,722
- In the morning?
- Yes, in the morning.

248
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,943
Go back to sleep.
I'm sorry I woke you.

249
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:34,613
Hey, where you going?
Come back here.

250
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:36,493
I can't, I promised Nick, Bobby,
and Phillip I'd meet up with them

251
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:39,000
- for breakfast before the pitch.
- I thought the pitch was at breakfast.

252
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:41,461
It is, but we can't walk in there
unprepared. We got to go over our notes,

253
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,690
talk strategy.
It's a pre-Breakfast breakfast.

254
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:45,711
- Work dork.
- Did you just call me a work dork?

255
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,660
Admit it.
Just admit that you're a work dork.

256
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,622
I'll admit that I'm a work dork if you
admit that you love that I'm a work dork.

257
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:51,772
Done.

258
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:53,612
Now I really have to go.

259
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:55,170
Hey, I have ways of making you stay,
you know.

260
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,253
I know, I know,
but take pity on me, please.

261
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:59,363
After work,
I promise I'm all yours. Dinner?

262
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:01,111
Is it a pre-dinner
dinner or a real dinner?

263
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,002
As many dinners as you want.

264
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,590
Aw, man, I can't believe we've
wasted 4 1/2 hours on sleep.

265
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:07,331
What are we down to now,
like 15 hours?

266
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:09,670
Rory, I'm actually gonna need
both arms for this pitch.

267
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:10,902
Okay, I'll let go.
Just one more kiss.

268
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:12,822
- I don't believe you.
- Try me.

269
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:16,231
- Hey! No fair!
- I'll call you later.

270
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:18,670
- Work dork!
- Work dork lover.

271
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:27,773
You need a tissue?
Oh, god, what is that?

272
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,183
I don't know,
but it's horrible.

273
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:31,732
Oh,  it is. It's foul.
It's like rotten cabbage.

274
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:34,892
Or with dense but subtle
undertones of olives.

275
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:37,711
There's nothing subtle about it.
It's like a sledgehammer to the nose.

276
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:39,690
Oh, my god! What is that?

277
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:40,910
It's not coming
from the kitchen?

278
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:42,391
Bite your tongue.

279
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:44,552
Wait, are we having
heart attacks right now?

280
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:46,963
Isn't smelling something strange
the first sign of a heart attack?

281
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,953
I don't think we're having a
communal massive heart attack.

282
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,451
- Carcasses.
- What?

283
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:52,022
Those strange,
angry-looking guests --

284
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:54,273
I'm sure they are traveling
with decaying animal flesh.

285
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,582
Yeah, 'cause that's the
most logical explanation.

286
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:59,490
Gonna open a window,
see if we can air it out a little bit.

287
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:02,181
- No, no, no!
- Close it! Close it! Close it!

288
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:04,360
So glad we tried that.

289
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:06,340
All right, I'm going out there
to see what's causing this.

290
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,063
- Out there?!
- Are you crazy?!

291
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,202
Maybe, but the sooner we can
find out what's causing this,

292
00:12:10,236 --> 00:12:12,751
the sooner we can run like
hell to less stinky ground.

293
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,732
- I'm coming with you, then!
- Me too!

294
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:15,843
Let's hang for a minute.

295
00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:18,151
If she makes it to the end of the block,
we'll join her.

296
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,962
- Michel!
- What?

297
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:21,641
Fine.

298
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:26,702
Kirk, where's everybody going?

299
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,612
Taylor called an
emergency town meeting.

300
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:29,790
Not sure why.

301
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:32,552
The smell, Kirk.
The horrible, horrible smell.

302
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:33,443
Really?

303
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:35,442
I just don't think
it's that bad.

304
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,270
Well, come on, let's go.

305
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,120
No. You know what?
On second thought,

306
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:41,423
I'd rather smell this smell
for the rest of my life

307
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:43,442
than see Luke at
a town meeting.

308
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,002
- Oh, honey.
- It's okay.

309
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,861
I'll go back to the Inn.
I'll be fine.

310
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:49,451
Just call me when you
want me to pick you up.

311
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:53,510
Finally!

312
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:56,222
It's about time, Taylor!
We're dying here.

313
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,951
I assure you, no one is dying.

314
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,383
The substance causing this odor

315
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:03,153
is not toxic in any way,
shape, or form.

316
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:05,503
- It's pickles.
- That's no pickle!

317
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:07,863
Pickle? Like one giant pickle?

318
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,501
Order!

319
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:12,830
As those of you who take an interest
in civic events may recall,

320
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:15,481
three days ago a train
derailed just east of town --

321
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,883
luckily, no one was
injured. However,

322
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:22,011
3 1/2 tons of pickles and pickle
brine were scattered along the tracks.

323
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:25,270
And due to some inevitable
delays in cleanup,

324
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:29,451
those pickles have been baking
in the sun for three days.

325
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:31,900
And you knew about this?

326
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,230
It's a cover-up.

327
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:35,162
We  got picklegate!

328
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:38,603
I did know about it, but it wasn't
a problem until this morning

329
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:40,480
when the wind shifted.

330
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:43,051
And instead of wafting easterly

331
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,730
toward our neighbors
in Woodbridge,

332
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:48,590
the smell seems to have
settled on Stars Hollow.

333
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:51,722
Now, there's no telling
how long it will last.

334
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,762
What?! People are
suffering here.

335
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,813
How long does it take to pick
up a few measly pickles?

336
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:02,591
Picking up the pickles is not
my main concern at the moment.

337
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:06,230
Now, this is a matter
of pride, people.

338
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,721
A huge principle is at stake.

339
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:11,520
There's absolutely no reason
why we here in Stars Hollow

340
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:14,103
should take responsibility
for this mess.

341
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:17,591
The pickles themselves
hail from Ohio.

342
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:20,281
The railroad company is incorporated
in the state of Delaware.

343
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:24,002
And since all the pickles are on
the Woodbridge side of the tracks --

344
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:27,082
Just pick up the damn
pickles, Taylor!

345
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:30,180
Easier said than done.

346
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,573
Even if we wanted to
do the wrong thing

347
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:36,253
and assume fiscal
responsibility for this fiasco,

348
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,970
the cost is astronomical.

349
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:42,001
- $2,500 for --
- Sold!

350
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:44,182
- Done!
- Pay, you big cheapskate!

351
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:46,003
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

352
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:48,950
All those in favor
of Stars Hollow

353
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:52,930
taking a swift kick to the tush
and shouldering the entire cost --

354
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,833
- Aye!
- Aye!

355
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,252
Very well.

356
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:58,812
Motion carried.

357
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:02,023
Pickle smell gone
in 48 hours...

358
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:05,213
along with everything
good about Stars Hollow.

359
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:11,830
Breathe that in.
Isn't that fantastic?

360
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:14,321
Forgot what fresh,
pickleless air smells like.

361
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:16,542
Oh, so, you coming over to my
neck of the woods for lunch

362
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:19,722
is really no reflection on how
desperately you needed to see me?

363
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:24,221
Hmm...10% desperate need to see you,
90% pickles.

364
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,851
You know, I'm actually looking
forward to friday night dinner.

365
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,013
Because, as you well know,
the Gilmore house,

366
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:31,982
like very expensive vodka,
is completely odorless.

367
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,521
And you still want
me to come with?

368
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:35,543
Yes, you, me, Rory,
numbers, babe.

369
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:39,343
G.G., no. Skirt down! G.G.!

370
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:42,010
You may want to look into
the whole skort concept.

371
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:44,361
Hey, so,
I spoke with Sherry this morning.

372
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,993
Oh, yeah.
What's the deal with her?

373
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:49,212
Well, first she and G.G.
spoke for almost half an hour.

374
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:51,201
That's as long as you can
do anything when you're 4.

375
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,813
And then she and I talked.
I thanked her for the letter.

376
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:55,290
She said everything
in it was true.

377
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:57,930
She's totally serious
about this new life thing.

378
00:15:57,946 --> 00:15:59,210
No more workaholic ways.

379
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:01,772
She's gardening and meditating,
all kinds of stuff.

380
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,952
She's very self-actualized --
her words, not mine.

381
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,172
Good for her.

382
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:09,032
And the big news is,
she wants me to send G.G. to Paris

383
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:10,843
to stay with her for
a couple of months.

384
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,500
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

385
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,011
I mean,
I know it seems kind of sudden,

386
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:16,561
but Sherry's taken this huge
leave of absence from work,

387
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,122
and G.G. got so excited.
I mean, why not, right?

388
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:20,910
She's not in school,
yet, just preschool,

389
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:22,692
and she needs to get to
know her mother sometime.

390
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:25,802
No, hey!
G.G., that's too high! Careful!

391
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:30,530
So, what --
would you go to Paris with her?

392
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:32,482
No, I was thinking the
nanny could take her.

393
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:33,560
She's dying to go.

394
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,832
I mean, it's Paris, right?
She's 25 years old.

395
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:37,582
It's a chance of a lifetime.

396
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:39,982
Yeah, sure.

397
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,542
No, hey!
G.G., no, don't pick that up!

398
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:43,811
I'll be right back.

399
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,452
You can't put Paris in charge.

400
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,701
She can and she should.

401
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,661
Guys, I just need someone to
get the paper out tonight.

402
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:54,812
Doesn't matter who.
I want the chain of command to be clear.

403
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,940
When the editor in chief isn't here,
the managing editor's in charge.

404
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,003
That's standard operating procedure
at every newspaper in the country.

405
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:03,072
Yes, but I've done
this 1,000 times,

406
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,442
and you've never done it, Bill.

407
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:05,540
Experience.

408
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:07,422
Experience that
led to a mutiny.

409
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:10,603
It's not like anyone ever gave Captain
Bligh another ship after the Bounty.

410
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:12,422
Of course they did,
multiple ships,

411
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:15,031
and by the time he died,
they promoted the guy to rear admiral.

412
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:17,820
Do you think the british royal navy
ruled the world in the 19th century

413
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:20,411
by letting that much natural
talent and leadership capability

414
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:22,362
go to waste just because
a few whiny complainers

415
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:24,461
wanted more breadfruit
and less scurvy?

416
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,632
Tell me you're not
seriously considering this.

417
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,840
The bunker.
Do you not remember the bunker?

418
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:31,222
I hardly see how my choice
of workplace is relevant.

419
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:34,322
There was an insurrection,
a revolt, an uprising.

420
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,482
She was deposed.

421
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:37,073
See how wordy he is?
He overwrites.

422
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,173
Plus, he's always been
weak with gerunds.

423
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:40,283
Sorry.

424
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:42,840
Look, could you guys take
this somewhere else?

425
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:44,530
Fine. Let's go to my desk.

426
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:47,712
Your desk? Right, like I'm actually
going to cede home-court advantage.

427
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:49,130
Oh, for god's sake.

428
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:50,520
Hey!

429
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,721
We did it, Ace!

430
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,293
- We bought the company!
- What?

431
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,950
It's crazy.
We were just supposed to have breakfast.

432
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:57,520
Next thing I know, we're sitting there
with lawyers going over contracts.

433
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,962
- Logan, that's amazing.
- I know!

434
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:02,002
Was it all because of my
breakfast-combo idea?

435
00:18:02,017 --> 00:18:03,902
I'm pretty sure that's
what sealed it.

436
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,522
So, will you come
celebrate with me tonight?

437
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:08,263
- I already cleared my schedule.
- Great! I'll send a car.

438
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:10,611
Tonight, you'll be dining
with a captain of industry.

439
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:12,211
Wow, do you get to
wear a uniform?

440
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:14,250
I'll have to check the fine print.
Go home, get dressed.

441
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:15,141
I'll see you soon.

442
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:16,533
Aye-aye, captain.

443
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,503
Cancel? Well,
I would say that depends.

444
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:21,801
What exactly is your
feeling about pickles?

445
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:23,570
Uh-huh, yes, pickles --

446
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:25,560
gherkins, dills.

447
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:28,640
For instance, if all the air
around you smelled like pickles

448
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:30,930
and there was no place to run,
no place to hide,

449
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:32,880
would you find that bothersome?

450
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,493
Michel, help. Let me in.

451
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:36,862
No, that is not a metaphor.

452
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:40,152
Yes, perhaps it would be better
if you checked in tomorrow night.

453
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:41,611
Uh-huh. Goodbye.

454
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:45,020
Michel, it's getting in my pores!
My pores are pickling!

455
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:49,212
Sorry, I didn't mean to
get you out of surgery.

456
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:51,082
Oh, mock the mask if you wish.

457
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,393
Oh, I will.

458
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:55,431
One is never too careful with
toxic pollutants in the air.

459
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:57,923
- Michel, it's just pickles.
- Oh, so they say!

460
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,273
Has anyone ever
seen these pickles?

461
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:02,641
Who's to say this is not
some sort of chemical weapon

462
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,670
the government is testing
on us behind our backs?

463
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,850
That's a cheery thought.

464
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:08,190
I have much scarier scenarios
if you want to hear them.

465
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:09,853
Yeah, maybe later.

466
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:12,392
Hey.

467
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:14,853
Wow, the smell is amazingly
not terrible in here.

468
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:15,830
What'd you do?

469
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:17,861
Well, after the town meeting,
I decided to make

470
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,381
some baked apples with
cinnamon and nutmeg.

471
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:23,541
- This is apples and cinnamon?
- Mnh-mnh. The apples failed me.

472
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:25,742
I mean,
a terrifically famous smell, right?

473
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:28,392
A powerful tool in the hands
of a real-estate agent.

474
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:30,060
Against the pickles
-- powerless.

475
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,460
What is it? It makes me happy.

476
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:35,143
The apples failed. I tried
cheeses and breads and chocolates.

477
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:37,381
But nothing could mask
the power of the pickles.

478
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:38,943
You know,
I think my sense of smell is ruined.

479
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,350
The insides of my
nose are burned out.

480
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:42,873
Then, I decided if you can't beat them,
join them.

481
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:44,380
Embrace the pickle!

482
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:45,652
Milton Berle it smells like?

483
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:47,841
Milton Berle? Are you saying my
kitchen smells like Milton Berle?

484
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:50,573
Milton Berle,
"Broadway Danny Rose", "Carnegie Deli".

485
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:53,770
- Pastrami.
- Pastrami!

486
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:55,192
You want a sandwich?
I'll make you a sandwich.

487
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,382
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

488
00:19:56,398 --> 00:19:59,841
I've got pumpernickel. I've got rye.
I've got this really nice mustard.

489
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:02,242
I've even got Dr.
Brown's cel-ray soda in the fridge.

490
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:04,583
Nah, I filled up on lunchables
in the park with Chris and G.G.

491
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:06,171
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

492
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:07,130
Lunchables, huh?

493
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:08,810
Don't judge what you
do not understand.

494
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:11,543
So, friday afternoon in the
park with Christopher, huh?

495
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:13,653
Yeah. You know,
I think I will have one.

496
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:16,092
Soda that tastes like vegetables --
who would have thunk it?

497
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,373
Hey, uh,
this kind of weird thing happened today.

498
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:19,071
Oh yeah?

499
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:22,042
So, apparently Sherry is trying to
get back in touch with Christopher.

500
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:23,573
Sherry "ex-wife" Sherry?

501
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:26,911
Sherry "abandoned her baby to go live
the life of a bon vivant" Sherry?

502
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,783
The very one.
She wrote him a letter -- "Mea culpa."

503
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:30,721
Mea culpa,
she's learned the error of her ways.

504
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,543
She wants to get back
in touch with G.G.

505
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:34,230
Translation --
she wants to get back with Christopher.

506
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:35,782
No, I don't think so.
She's dating someone.

507
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,361
She's doing downward dog with
some french yoga instructor.

508
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:41,460
Sherry "mani/pedi twice a
week" Sherry is doing yoga?

509
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:43,270
Allegedly. Who knows?

510
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:47,561
But then Chris went on about sending
G.G. to Paris with this 20-year-old nanny

511
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,741
so that G.G.
can reconnect with her mom.

512
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:52,123
- And you told him that's insane.
- No.

513
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:53,943
- What? Why not?
- I don't know.

514
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,613
Not saying what I think is not what
I'm known for, if you know what I mean.

515
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:59,451
No, no, I don't,
it's not what you're known for.

516
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:03,121
It's what you're not known for.
I mean, it's not what you're not --

517
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:06,253
- You're usually quite frank.
- I know.

518
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,962
It sounds like you're not quite
comfortable talking to Christopher.

519
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,280
- That's the thing. I am.
- Well, then why didn't you?

520
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:13,180
Because in my head,
I wasn't talking to Christopher.

521
00:21:13,217 --> 00:21:16,081
In the park, I was talking to Christopher,
but in my head, I was talking to Luke.

522
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:18,360
Oh, honey, of course you were.

523
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:21,470
No, I don't mean it like I missed him.
I mean it like

524
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:24,872
Luke is the one who didn't want me
getting involved in his kid's life,

525
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:25,852
not Chris.

526
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,152
Chris is open to what I think.
Chris is open to me.

527
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:30,731
Christopher is not Luke.

528
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:32,193
Nope, Christopher is not Luke.

529
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:34,123
Why aren't all nutritious
things in soda form?

530
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:35,683
That's a good question.

531
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:38,313
I swear I would eat my vegetables
if only they were fizzy.

532
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,003
Yay, Rory! Hello?

533
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:41,143
Hey, what's going on?

534
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:43,181
Uh, well Stars Hollow
smells like pickles.

535
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:44,200
- Pickles?
- Pickles.

536
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:45,630
- Pickles pickles?
- Pickles.

537
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:46,352
Why?

538
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:48,060
Because a pickle train crashed.

539
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:51,102
Is this a joke? Is this a long,
boring joke that I'm not going to get?

540
00:21:51,115 --> 00:21:52,832
No, it's no joke.
The town smells like pickles

541
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,371
because a pickle
train was derailed.

542
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:56,780
A train full of pickles?
Who knew there was such a thing?

543
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:59,312
Well, pickle-train conductors, for one.
Sounds so fun.

544
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:01,052
I would've been the greatest
pickle-train conductor.

545
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,750
Can you see me --
"All aboard, you pickles!"

546
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:05,410
Hmm. Clearly you
missed your calling.

547
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:07,350
Well, luckily there's you.
You're young, you're clever,

548
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:09,560
your great pickle-train
conducting hope.

549
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:10,932
I can't believe
I'm missing this.

550
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:12,973
Well, you can celebrate next
year on the anniversary.

551
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:14,151
What's going on with you?

552
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,862
Well, I can't make it to
friday night dinner tonight,

553
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,320
but I have a very good excuse.

554
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,730
Pickle-train
conducting seminar?

555
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:21,680
- Logan's in town.
- No way!

556
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,993
Yeah, he showed up last night.
It was a total surprise.

557
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:26,031
I can't believe you let me go on
about pickle-train conducting

558
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,363
- when you had actual news.
- You had news.

559
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:30,023
Stars Hollow smells
like pickles.

560
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:33,753
I can completely see that
scrolling along the CNN crawl.

561
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:35,710
Logan in town is
totally pre-pickle news.

562
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:37,301
How long is he here for?

563
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,383
6 1/2 more hours.
He flew in yesterday, bought a company,

564
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:42,281
- and he's flying back out tonight.
- Oh, my god.

565
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:44,593
What are you guys gonna do with
your precious remaining hours?

566
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:46,123
- Or don't I want to know?
- Mom!

567
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:49,071
Well, because you might be
farming rutabagas or something,

568
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,050
and I wouldn't want to
know 'cause -- boring.

569
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:53,840
Well, tonight I'm meeting him
in Manhattan to celebrate.

570
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,053
Fancy restaurant?

571
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,701
Rutabaga farm, actually.
Oh, but I'm sorry about dinner.

572
00:22:57,716 --> 00:22:59,753
I did not mean to abandon
you in your time of need.

573
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:02,400
No worries. I'm not gonna be totally
defenseless. I'm bringing your dad.

574
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:04,033
Really? Wow!

575
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,201
Yeah, thought it was time
he meet the parents.

576
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:08,150
Okay, that is pre-pickle news,
my friend.

577
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,383
Oh, this conversation's been a disaster,
hasn't it?

578
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:11,761
- Yes, it has.
- All right.

579
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:13,861
Bring-bring. Hi, Rory.
How are you?

580
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,160
Hi, mom. Logan's in town.

581
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:17,162
Oh, my goodness.
That's wonderful.

582
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:18,470
We're farming rutabagas.

583
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:20,310
Oh, you're a filthy child.

584
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:22,500
I will disown you.
Bringing your father to dinner.

585
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,830
Pickles, pickles, pickles,
smell, pickle-train conducting.

586
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:26,401
- Alas, alack.
- Good talk.

587
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:28,161
- The best.
- Bye.

588
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:31,782
Good evening. Can I take that?

589
00:23:31,796 --> 00:23:33,232
Thank you.

590
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:35,812
Um, I'm just meeting someone.

591
00:23:35,827 --> 00:23:38,382
- Ahoy, my captain of industry!
- Ace!

592
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:41,772
Hey, where is your uniform?
I was expecting the whole works --

593
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,822
a spiffy hat, shiny shoes,
epaulets with scrambled eggs on them.

594
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:46,682
Scrambled eggs on my clothes?
What you must think of me.

595
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,460
- You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

596
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:50,521
Though I was hoping you'd wear
a nice little sailor's middy.

597
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,730
- You look so cute in a middy.
- Oh, I'd love to wear a middy.

598
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,951
And a little sailor hat,
like the Stay-Puft marshmallow man.

599
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:57,460
Because who doesn't want to date
a giant humanoid marshmallow?

600
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,283
I'm so proud of you.

601
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:02,331
- Come on. Our table's over here.
- Okay.

602
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:05,631
Everybody, I'd like you to
meet my girlfriend, Rory.

603
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,350
Such a pleasure, Rory.
I'm Nick.

604
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:08,562
- Hi.
- And this is Phillip.

605
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:10,412
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

606
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:12,653
And I'm Bobby.
So, so glad you could join us.

607
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:14,852
Bobby, um... yeah, me too.

608
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:17,183
I'm so glad I could make it.
How are you?

609
00:24:17,198 --> 00:24:19,923
I'm brilliant, actually.
We had quite a day.

610
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:21,393
Shall we order another
bottle of champers, boys?

611
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:22,812
- Absolutely.
- Good. I'm parched.

612
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:25,681
- Do you drink?
- What? Um, yeah, sure.

613
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,260
Here. Sit, sit.

614
00:24:27,277 --> 00:24:30,190
Oh, food. Let's please get food.
I haven't eaten since the waffles.

615
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:31,432
Dear god. Did you eat those?

616
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:32,452
It would have been rude not to.

617
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:34,050
You eat anything.
You astound me.

618
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:35,491
You're like a human
garbage disposal.

619
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:37,510
It's appalling, Phillip.
Really it is.

620
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:38,900
You know what you should do?
You should go on one

621
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:40,922
of those American
reality TV series

622
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,480
and showcase your talents.

623
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:45,091
There are these huge waffles
at the breakfast this morning.

624
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:47,061
And Phillip ate them.
I'm catching on.

625
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:48,270
Logan, I know
we're celebrating,

626
00:24:48,306 --> 00:24:50,200
but I'm concerned about our
budget for this project.

627
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,821
From a strictly economic perpective,
do we really want to blow everything

628
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,410
on feeding Phillip tonight?

629
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,430
Somebody's got to
crunch the numbers.

630
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:58,051
It's true.
The numbers do not crunch themselves.

631
00:24:58,086 --> 00:25:01,002
Ergo, the number
cruncher must be fed.

632
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:03,751
So, Rory,
I've heard so much about you!

633
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:04,360
Oh, yeah?

634
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:06,002
Logan has talked my
ear off about you.

635
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:07,723
Oh, yeah, yeah. Me too.

636
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:10,090
He's talked my ear off
about you and all of you.

637
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:12,550
I mean, I'm practically Van
Gogh from my earlessness.

638
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:15,203
Did we order champagne, yet?
Logan, your girlfriend must be parched.

639
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:18,370
Oh, excuse me, miss. I think we'd
like another bottle, please.

640
00:25:18,388 --> 00:25:20,140
Oh, and bring
another bread plate.

641
00:25:20,597 --> 00:25:21,983
You're amazing.

642
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:23,623
- Ridiculous.
- I'm hungry.

643
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:30,301
Oh, no.
You know my rule about hair bands.

644
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:32,313
My car, my tunes.

645
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:34,522
Really? You're
gonna say, "tunes"?

646
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:36,152
You got a lot of rules, lady.

647
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:39,121
Not a lot. It's just no saying
"killer," no saying "wack,"

648
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,953
no saying "rockin'" or "pimping"
or "slamming," capisce?

649
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:43,161
Fo' shizzle.

650
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,002
There's got to be an eject
button here somewhere.

651
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,783
How's this for an idea --
weekend away, the two of us?

652
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:49,741
That's great for an idea.
Ooh! Ooh!

653
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:51,161
I know the perfect place.

654
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:54,021
Don't say "Dollywood."
Please, don't, don't say "Dollywood."

655
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:56,232
- The ice hotel.
- The what?

656
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:57,780
The ice hotel. It's amazing.

657
00:25:57,795 --> 00:25:59,223
I read about it in
the travel section.

658
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:01,760
It's a hotel totally made of ice.
The roof is ice. The floors are ice.

659
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:04,852
The tables are ice. The chairs are ice.
Chandeliers are ice.

660
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,242
I think I'm beginning
to get the picture.

661
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:07,973
Wouldn't it be amazing if
you went down the hall

662
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,441
and the ice machine was empty?

663
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:10,860
It is amazing.

664
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,303
Amazingly cold.

665
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:14,803
No. You get to wear
parkas and fur hats.

666
00:26:14,817 --> 00:26:15,593
"Get to"?

667
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:18,451
And you sleep under reindeer skins.
You eat reindeer meat.

668
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:19,772
Again, "get to"?

669
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,733
You drink vodka.
That's a good "get to."

670
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,431
Hey, how's this for an idea?
We can drink vodka in Bermuda.

671
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:28,112
The ice hotel in Bermuda
would totally melt.

672
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:30,241
We'll do two weekends away.
First the ice hotel.

673
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:31,953
Then once we've been
treated for frostbite

674
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,781
and had our stomachs
pumped of reindeer meat,

675
00:26:33,797 --> 00:26:35,981
we'll go defrost on
a beach somewhere.

676
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:39,262
I mean, we've got the time. G.G.'s gonna
be in Paris for a couple of months.

677
00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:44,262
What? You're not down with
the whole beach thing?

678
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:48,942
No, it's...
more the whole Paris thing.

679
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:50,601
Yes?

680
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:56,613
I-I'm just... I'm not sure it's such
a good idea that G.G. goes to Paris.

681
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:58,143
Meaning?

682
00:26:58,155 --> 00:27:00,402
Well, she's only 4 years old.

683
00:27:00,415 --> 00:27:03,022
She barely even knows Sherry.

684
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:05,043
Yeah, but Sherry's her mother.

685
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,011
A mother she hasn't
seen in two years.

686
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,463
Look, Sherry's doing really well.
You read her letter.

687
00:27:09,475 --> 00:27:11,673
And I think I've been doing
a really good job with G.G.

688
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:13,732
Oh, honey. Amazing.

689
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:14,920
But it's hard, you know?

690
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:18,070
It's -- It's really hard, and G.G.
needs her mom.

691
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:20,012
And if I can help bring
them both back together,

692
00:27:20,028 --> 00:27:22,390
I want to do that.
I have to do that.

693
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,900
I know, I get that. I just --

694
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:27,193
I think maybe you should put
a little more thought into it,

695
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:29,910
you know, before you send 
a toddler on an airplane

696
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,770
with an 18-year-old nanny who's
totally psyched to go to France.

697
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:35,533
- The nanny's 25.
- Oh, oh, okay, then.

698
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:37,510
Like the nanny's really
your problem here.

699
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:39,850
Well, I mean,
it's not an un-problem, you know?

700
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,003
I think you should just
consider it more carefully

701
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:43,512
or maybe go yourself.

702
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:45,933
- Look, I read her letter --
- Oh, my god! Enough!

703
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:48,050
Enough with the letter already.

704
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:52,211
I get it.

705
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:53,971
What do you get?

706
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:55,733
This is about you being
threatened by Sherry.

707
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:57,730
No, no. Give me a break.

708
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,090
- You never liked her.
- No, I didn't.

709
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:01,372
But I don't like the new mailman either.
Doesn't mean I'm threatened by him.

710
00:28:01,406 --> 00:28:03,891
That's not what this is about.
This is about me thinking I could speak

711
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:05,841
openly and honestly
about my concerns

712
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,543
without getting freaked out on.

713
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:09,111
Nice. Real nice.

714
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:10,392
Honey, what is
going on with you?

715
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,012
What's going on with you, Lor?

716
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:15,083
Look, can we drop this, please,
and try and have a nice evening?

717
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:16,532
It's dropped.

718
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:20,101
Well, hello, hello!
Richard, they're here.

719
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:21,780
Don't you two look marvelous?

720
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:24,262
Well, don't just stand there.
Come in, come in.

721
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:29,503
It was the way he kept saying
"intellectual property."

722
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:31,903
I could feel the whole deal just
slipping through our fingers.

723
00:28:31,937 --> 00:28:34,402
He was like, "intellectual property.
Intellectual property."

724
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:36,543
"Which is like my property,
my property."

725
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:37,901
"I invented it, I invented it."

726
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,161
"We won't sell, we won't sell."

727
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:40,723
"And it's slipping. Slipping."

728
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:43,722
I'm looking at Nick trying to convey
through subtle dilations of my pupils

729
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:45,652
that we cannot offer
any more money.

730
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:47,832
And I'm looking at Phillip
who's looking at me like,

731
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:50,162
like he's hopped up on some
sort of methamphetamine.

732
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:53,972
Slipping, slipping, and it looks
like we lost him, and then Bobby.

733
00:28:53,988 --> 00:28:56,520
- Bobby makes a bold choice.
- What does she do?

734
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:57,931
- She just stands up.
- She does.

735
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,751
- She just stands up!
- Wow.

736
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:01,702
She stands up like she can't
take it anymore, and she says,

737
00:29:01,738 --> 00:29:03,330
"meeting's over, boys."

738
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:05,770
- That must have been crazy.
- It was amazing.

739
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,472
I'm sitting here, and she's here,
and she stands up.

740
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:10,973
And I look over,
and all I see is legs, legs, legs

741
00:29:10,986 --> 00:29:13,712
and this look on her
face like "ohh, no."

742
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:15,783
It was brilliant.
Do it, Bobby. Stand up.

743
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,992
- Knock it off.
- Come on, Bobby. You got to see this.

744
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,653
- But we insist.
- Please?

745
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:22,063
Fine. But just to
shut you lot up.

746
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:24,460
I suppose it was
something like, um...

747
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,472
...meeting's over, boys.

748
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:31,391
Whoo! Well done!

749
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,861
- Amazing, huh?
- We need another bottle!

750
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:36,370
And dessert. Don't we need
a little sweet or something?

751
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:38,801
So, Rory, we've barely had the
opportunity to speak all night.

752
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:40,793
- I know.
- How's school? What's your major?

753
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:43,160
- English.
- Oh, god, how fantastic.

754
00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:45,650
I swear when I was at Oxford,
I did nothing but read literature.

755
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:47,152
It was such a luxury.

756
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:49,952
- That's one way to look at it.
- Oh, I long for those days.

757
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:52,140
Just reading books, thinking.

758
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:54,281
- I do like thinking.
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

759
00:29:54,296 --> 00:29:56,670
Before you know it, you'll be out in
the real world with the rest of us.

760
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:58,663
Seems like you manage
to have some fun.

761
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:02,210
Well, Logan is a big part of that.
He is such a laugh.

762
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:04,711
He's actually a lot more
serious than you might think.

763
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:07,803
It probably takes a long time to
get to know that side of him,

764
00:30:07,818 --> 00:30:08,950
the serious side.

765
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:11,332
Oh, you two are so adorable.

766
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,961
- Thanks.
- Hey, not so fast!

767
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:14,540
We're still working on
getting the next round.

768
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:16,333
Another sloe gin fizz, please.

769
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,993
Oh, and don't get
too excited, fellas.

770
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:19,591
I'm just going to the loo.

771
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:22,273
- Yes! That's it!
- Amazing! Magnificent!

772
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,562
- We fold, we fold.
- Thank you, thank you very much.

773
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:28,423
And feel free to say all sorts of
cheeky things about me while I'm gone.

774
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:30,290
Isn't she a riot?

775
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:31,912
Hilarious.

776
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:35,411
Well, naturally I thought they
were referring to the archduke.

777
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:37,352
So I jumped in,
as who wouldn't?

778
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:39,733
With some thoughts about the
various conspiracy theories

779
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:43,293
surrounding his infamous
assassination in Sarajevo.

780
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:45,601
Imagine my surprise when I
learned that Franz Ferdinand

781
00:30:45,618 --> 00:30:48,892
was the name of a very
popular rock-'n'-roll band.

782
00:30:49,938 --> 00:30:53,191
That's what he gets for trying to
fraternize after class with his students.

783
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,882
One of them even offered
to burn a CD for me.

784
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:58,492
So, tell me.
How are the salads?

785
00:30:58,505 --> 00:30:59,523
Good, mom.

786
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:01,180
- I like the pear.
- Do you?

787
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,452
- I'm so glad.
- Tastes very fresh.

788
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:06,120
Well, pears this time of
year can dress up any salad.

789
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:08,282
Oh, Richard,
did you tell them about midterms?

790
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:10,410
Lorelai, did your father
mention midterms?

791
00:31:10,428 --> 00:31:12,513
No, he didn't.
How were midterms, dad?

792
00:31:12,527 --> 00:31:15,341
As you know, midterms separate
the wheat from the chaff.

793
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:17,823
although I don't have to grade
any of their papers or tests.

794
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,791
They have these marvelous
teaching assistants

795
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:22,141
that handle all that
sort of things for you.

796
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:23,812
Thank you, Hildegard.

797
00:31:23,827 --> 00:31:25,513
Christopher, I hope
you like lamb.

798
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,493
When I found out that you were coming,
I decided we had to serve

799
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:30,413
something special.
And to me, special means lamb.

800
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:33,190
Oh, it just makes me so happy to see
the two of you sitting here together.

801
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:34,520
It's such fun.

802
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:36,171
It's very nice to be here.

803
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,071
- Tennis!
- Emily?

804
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:40,262
That's one of the things we
can do together as a foursome,

805
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:42,583
now that Lorelai and
Christopher are an item.

806
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:45,193
That's right.
We do need new people for doubles.

807
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,291
We've been playing with
that awful Bunny Ferguson

808
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,053
And her husband,
whatever his name is.

809
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:50,033
They are dreadful.

810
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:52,301
The way Bunny Ferguson
grunts -- oh!

811
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:54,650
I mean, it's one thing 
if you're Maria Sharapova

812
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:58,023
and you're 120 pounds and
a 7-foot blond teenager.

813
00:31:58,037 --> 00:32:00,641
- But if you're 5'3"...
- And 53...

814
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:02,073
And wearing plaid --

815
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,372
Did you see that skirt she wore
the last time we played them?

816
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:05,970
I can only think
that it was designed

817
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:07,922
to cause some sort of
optic misfunction.

818
00:32:07,938 --> 00:32:09,890
Then you'll play with us?

819
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,090
Lorelai?

820
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:12,390
Hmm? Yes, fine, great.

821
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:13,392
It's a date.

822
00:32:13,406 --> 00:32:16,123
How does the saturday after
next work for everyone?

823
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:17,283
Sure.

824
00:32:17,296 --> 00:32:18,770
Ah, here's the lamb.

825
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:21,641
You do like lamb, Christopher?
I'm afraid I never let you answer.

826
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:24,281
I do. The funny thing is,
I never did when I was a kid,

827
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:27,832
but I do now. I guess I've changed.
People do that sometimes.

828
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,033
That's so true.

829
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,952
What a clever observation.
It's like you and radishes.

830
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:32,673
Exactly.

831
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:34,952
Your father used to hate radishes.
Thought they were disgusting.

832
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,261
Well, they are roots.
It's a little unappealing.

833
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:39,583
And then one summer in Aspen,
he fell off a horse,

834
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:42,771
and suddenly he loved radishes.
That whole summer, he was radish-crazy.

835
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:45,420
It's true.
I do like radishes to this day.

836
00:32:45,438 --> 00:32:47,292
- That's funny.
- Isn't it?

837
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:49,013
Yes. I don't like radishes.

838
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:51,311
I guess it's because I
find them threatening.

839
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:52,643
What a peculiar thing to say.

840
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:54,501
Radishes are a peculiar topic.

841
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:55,811
All right.

842
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:57,901
Since this is a special
occasion of sorts,

843
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:00,070
I should like to
propose a toast.

844
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:01,912
To many more nights like this,

845
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:03,853
and to Lorelai and Christopher.

846
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:07,090
Who knew 20-some-odd years ago
that we would be making dates

847
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:08,910
- to play doubles tennis?
- And bridge.

848
00:33:08,927 --> 00:33:10,851
You absolutely have to
join us for bridge.

849
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:14,091
You two have come a long way since
your days of rebellious youth,

850
00:33:14,107 --> 00:33:15,231
shall we say?

851
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:17,051
Derelicts. The
word is derelicts.

852
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:18,250
Emily!

853
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:20,563
To Lorelai and Christopher.

854
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:27,172
They were derelicts. It's true.

855
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:30,843
Remember when they stole that bottle of
wine you'd been saving for 15 years?

856
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:33,851
Well, 10 years.
It was a '75 Margot.

857
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:35,803
And they had no idea
how to use a corkscrew,

858
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:37,671
so they just cracked
the top off with a brick

859
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:39,561
and slurped what they
could off the patio.

860
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:40,941
And look at them now.

861
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:44,121
All grown up and drinking
very nicely out of glasses.

862
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:45,821
I need to see you
in the bathroom.

863
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,142
Fine.

864
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,393
Excuse me.

865
00:33:57,387 --> 00:33:59,081
Would you mind telling
me what the hell --

866
00:33:59,095 --> 00:34:00,490
- You're not Sherry.
- Excuse me?

867
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:02,002
You've changed, Chris.

868
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:03,212
What are you talking about?

869
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:05,041
Maybe we were
derelicts back then.

870
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:07,173
But we were 16.
We were just kids.

871
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:08,651
- You were just a kid.
- So?

872
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:12,090
So, you leaving Rory when you
were 16 is not at all the same

873
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:15,230
as Sherry, a grown woman,
packing up and living G.G.

874
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:16,801
So I get why you
were upset with me.

875
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:20,020
Because when I'm criticizing Sherry,
you feel like I'm criticizing you.

876
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:21,703
But I wasn't. I'm not.

877
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:24,522
You've changed. You're not 16.
You're not a kid.

878
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:25,930
You're not Sherry. I get it.

879
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:28,070
Wow, you get it.
That's great, Lor.

880
00:34:28,086 --> 00:34:31,000
Thanks for telling
me how I feel.

881
00:34:38,755 --> 00:34:40,723
- You tired?
- I'm good.

882
00:34:40,737 --> 00:34:43,292
I could always have the car
come pick us up at the corner.

883
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:44,403
I'm fine.

884
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,272
Hey, I know. I could carry you.

885
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,670
- Carry me?
- Yeah.

886
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:50,490
Piggyback, fireman's carry,
in both arms -- your choice.

887
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,690
No.

888
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,541
I'm really fine.

889
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,853
Wow, okay.
So, I guess something's really wrong.

890
00:34:57,868 --> 00:34:59,933
Just because I don't want
to be fireman carried

891
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:01,590
doesn't mean that
something is wrong.

892
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:04,383
- But something is wrong.
- No, it's just --

893
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:06,123
Just?

894
00:35:06,935 --> 00:35:11,813
This isn't exactly what
I expected tonight.

895
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:14,401
I was just a little confused,
I guess.

896
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:17,193
You called. You were so excited.
You said, "celebrate."

897
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:20,033
I thought it was
gonna be just us.

898
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:21,291
Last night was just us.

899
00:35:21,307 --> 00:35:25,601
I know,
and it was also perfect and romantic.

900
00:35:25,617 --> 00:35:29,850
And the more I talk about it, the more
I feel stupid for even bringing this up.

901
00:35:29,865 --> 00:35:32,381
Look, I'm sorry I wasn't
clear on the phone.

902
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,400
I'm sorry that you didn't
have a good time tonight.

903
00:35:34,438 --> 00:35:38,161
Well, no, it's not that. I mean,
I get it. The guys are great. Okay.

904
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:42,990
But, technically Bobby, well,
she's not exactly a guy.

905
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:44,732
Yeah, you got me there.

906
00:35:44,747 --> 00:35:48,251
And until about three hours ago,
I thought that she was a guy.

907
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:49,261
You know why?

908
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:52,171
Because you never use personal
pronouns -- "She," "her."

909
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:54,151
I mean, would that have been
so unbelievably difficult

910
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:55,881
to fit into a conversation?

911
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:59,742
I don't know about you, but most
of the Bobbys I know are guys --

912
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:04,023
Bobby Kennedy, Bobby Brady,
Bobby Knight, Bobby Brown.

913
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,182
You're smiling at me.
Why are smiling at me?

914
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,120
Because you are very cute
when you're jealous.

915
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:09,631
- I'm not jealous.
- Rory.

916
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:13,061
Oh, and it's not just that.
I mean, it was everything.

917
00:36:13,077 --> 00:36:16,590
It was not feeling
like I was included.

918
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,303
I mean, no one all night
asked me anything about me.

919
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:20,471
Bobby asked you about you.

920
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:22,583
Yeah, and how
condescending was she?

921
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,251
"It's such a luxury
to read literature."

922
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:26,621
And did you hear
what she called us?

923
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:29,430
"Adorable." She called
us an adorable couple.

924
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:32,312
- Wait, she said that out loud?
- Yes, adorable.

925
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:34,083
Wow, you want me to go back
there and kick her ass?

926
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:36,891
"Adorable" is what you say
about a "Full House" rerun.

927
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:39,321
It's not what you say
about something that lasts.

928
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:41,843
The great wall of China, the pyramids --
no one ever called them "adorable."

929
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:45,760
And excuse me, but how many times does
a girl need to stand up at dinner?

930
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:47,851
Yes, you have legs. We get it.

931
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:50,740
"Oh, no, I'm not leaving.
I'm just going to the loo."

932
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:53,350
Here's a tip. You're in america now.
Speak english.

933
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:56,062
Okay, so just to clarify,
in the future, you would prefer

934
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:57,901
I work only with girls
who have no legs.

935
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,551
You're not taking me seriously.

936
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:01,161
Because you're
not being serious.

937
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,733
Bobby is my colleague.
She's great at what she does.

938
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:06,261
She's smart. She's talented.
Nick has great legs, too.

939
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:08,260
Maybe before you rush to judgment,
you should check his out.

940
00:37:08,298 --> 00:37:12,320
Great. So now I'm not just an idiot,
I'm an anti-feminist idiot,

941
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:15,052
an anti-feminist who's
standing here in the street

942
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,720
arguing about things I don't
really want to be arguing about.

943
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:18,711
- You don't?
- No.

944
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:20,833
Do you think I like
feeling this way?

945
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:22,723
I mean, I haven't seen
you for months and months,

946
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:25,752
and now you're in town for what?
26 hours?

947
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:29,660
And in that time, I can't just get
happy and act like a fruit fly?

948
00:37:29,677 --> 00:37:30,921
Mayfly.

949
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:34,762
I can't just live in the moment and
enjoy the 26 great hours ahead of me?

950
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:37,761
I have to be sulky and miserable
while all the other fruit flies

951
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:40,062
share private jokes
with my boyfriend?

952
00:37:40,077 --> 00:37:42,270
You think I like this
about myself? Wrong.

953
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:43,863
I hate myself for
being this way.

954
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,351
I hate Bobby for her
professionally tweezed eyebrows

955
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:50,130
and her oh-so-incredible ability
to stand up at a moment's notice.

956
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,573
And most of all,
I hate the fact that in a few seconds

957
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:54,870
you'll be in that
car leaving me again.

958
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:58,200
That is a hell of a long way to
go just to say, "I miss you."

959
00:37:58,218 --> 00:37:59,863
Any thoughts in response?

960
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,871
I miss you, too, Ace.

961
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:05,630
Five words.
You only used five words.

962
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:07,641
Yeah, well, I'm not done yet.

963
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:17,951
Of course, this time of year,
so many people start playing

964
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:21,740
that awful winter tennis with the
chicken-wire cages and the heated courts.

965
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:24,121
Platform tennis can be
very enjoyable, Emily.

966
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:27,263
Yes, but it looks ridiculous,
like glorified ping-pong.

967
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:29,951
If I wanted to play ping-pong,
I would --

968
00:38:29,985 --> 00:38:32,870
Well, if I wanted to play ping-pong,
I would kill myself.

969
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:35,680
Well, I hope you're still good
with a racket, Christopher.

970
00:38:35,696 --> 00:38:37,182
Lorelai was always hopeless.

971
00:38:37,197 --> 00:38:40,480
As a child, we took her to an
ophthalmologist to test her
depth perception.

972
00:38:40,497 --> 00:38:42,602
He could find no
rational reason for it.

973
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:43,981
I know I'm not Sherry.

974
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:46,692
I'm sorry. Did he serve you Sherry?
Richard, there's been some mistake.

975
00:38:46,726 --> 00:38:48,393
Christopher's drink was
supposed to be port.

976
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:50,092
Come to Paris with me.

977
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:51,641
- What?
- You were right.

978
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:53,932
I should take G.G.
myself, check everything out.

979
00:38:53,947 --> 00:38:55,120
Check what out?

980
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:57,331
Paris. I think they want
to check out Paris.

981
00:38:57,346 --> 00:38:59,671
Come on. You can't say "no." I mean,
you can, but don't.

982
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:03,802
Maybe there's even a Parisian
ice hotel we can stay in.

983
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:06,382
Yes. I mean, no,
there is no ice hotel.

984
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:08,391
But I'll stay in one
made of stone or bricks

985
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:10,110
or whatever Paris
hotels are made of.

986
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:12,881
We can blast the air-conditioning
and drink all the vodka you want.

987
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:15,120
- What on earth --
- That sounds great.

988
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:17,123
What happened when you
went to the powder room?

989
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:18,671
One minute,
we're sitting here having dessert.

990
00:39:18,707 --> 00:39:20,171
And the next,
you're talking about Paris.

991
00:39:20,205 --> 00:39:22,571
Well, Chris and I
are going to Paris.

992
00:39:22,588 --> 00:39:24,020
In just a couple of
weeks, actually.

993
00:39:24,025 --> 00:39:26,801
I'm so sorry we're gonna have to take
a rain check on that tennis date.

994
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:30,001
Yeah, till the 12th of never 'cause we
wouldn't play tennis or golf or bridge

995
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:32,452
or any game that could be
played in a foursome --

996
00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:34,371
except hangman and
sometimes pictionary.

997
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:37,092
What has gotten into you?
You were being so pleasant all evening.

998
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,670
Mmm, what is this?
This looks good.

999
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:42,862
"What is it"? I told you 20 minutes ago.
It was rhubarb pie.

1000
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:44,850
Hmm. Is it still rhubarb pie?

1001
00:39:44,868 --> 00:39:47,312
I swear I was having
the most wonderful time.

1002
00:39:47,327 --> 00:39:48,842
Is rhubarb a root, dad?

1003
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:49,971
No.

1004
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,122
- Hi, everyone.
- Honey!

1005
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,172
- Hey.
- Am I late?

1006
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:56,710
Of course not, Rory.

1007
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,243
You're just in time
for rooty rhubarb pie,

1008
00:39:59,257 --> 00:40:02,473
and for the viewing
of mom's mug shot.

1009
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:03,530
Rory, stop her.

1010
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:05,190
I'm sure you look
very nice, grandma.

1011
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,882
You are very photogenic, Emily.

1012
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:09,701
Ooh! What am I saying?
I have pictures on my phone.

1013
00:40:09,715 --> 00:40:11,503
Gather 'round the
phone, everybody.

1014
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:12,961
Richard, what are you doing?

1015
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:14,421
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

1016
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,373
Oh! These new
phones are amazing.

1017
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:20,503
Are those handcuffs?
Grandma, are you wearing handcuffs?

1018
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:21,851
I certainly was not.

1019
00:40:21,865 --> 00:40:23,561
No, they gave her one of
those ankle things instead

1020
00:40:23,598 --> 00:40:25,352
with like a chain and
cannonball on the end.

1021
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:26,271
Christopher!

1022
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:28,313
Oh, and the stripy outfit.
Tell Rory how they made you wear

1023
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:29,882
the stripy outfit, mom.

1024
00:40:33,136 --> 00:40:34,762
No.

1025
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:39,951
No!

1026
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:44,281
- No!
- No!

1027
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,602
- Yeah, yeah, that one!
- Yeah! Stop there!

1028
00:41:05,526 --> 00:41:08,700
