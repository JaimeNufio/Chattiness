1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:03,754
I'm back.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:04,838
Kitchen.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,341
I couldn't make up my mind...

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,469
so I got The Shining and Bringing Up Baby.

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,804
Now, I know you're thinking:

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:17,017
'One's a movie about a homicidal parent,
and the other one's... '

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:18,852
- Hello.
- Hi.

8
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,312
- Hi, Mom.
- What'd you break?

9
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,189
Nothing. The broiler.

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,525
But this came for you and Max.

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,611
We're thinking it's a wedding present.

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,869
'Lorelai Gilmore and Max Medina. '
Guess news doesn't always travel fast.

13
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,120
- Are you gonna open it?
- No.

14
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,580
Aren't you curious?

15
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,959
No, just leave it there.
I'll take it back tomorrow.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,002
But there's not a return address.

17
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,295
- Isn't there a card?
- No.

18
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,631
- Maybe there's one inside.
- With a return address.

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,299
You'd have to open it to find out.

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,724
Fine. Give me a knife.

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,137
This is so exciting. Maybe not.

22
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,854
An ice-cream maker!

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,904
A Musso Lussino 480.

24
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,781
Somebody sent a fascist ice-cream maker?

25
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,152
Italian design, stainless steel body,
chrome finish.

26
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,279
And no card. Perfect.

27
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,782
Jackson just got in his apple crop.
We can make cider ice cream.

28
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,619
We can, using his ice cream maker.
But II Duce here is going back.

29
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,996
To where? Maybe it's an orphan.

30
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,338
That's right. We'd be giving it a home.

31
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,334
Once again, I bring up the fact
that this is a wedding present.

32
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,628
As I am not getting married,
neither God's law...

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,964
nor Emily Post allows me to keep this.

34
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,175
But isn't there a rule about late presents?

35
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:35,179
Like, if it arrives after a certain date,
the giver forfeits all rights of return.

36
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,555
- Exactly.
- Nice try.

37
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,515
It's true. I saw it on Martha Stewart.

38
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,186
She was doing a double program.
The first half was on massaging your dog.

39
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,521
And she had this chow,
and she was rubbing it...

40
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,943
But the second half was about gifts,
and she said if it arrives after 10 weeks...

41
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,071
- Eight.
- Eight weeks, you don't have to return it.

42
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,206
Clearly this is shaping up
to be one of those moments...

43
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,203
that St. Peter will show
on the big video screen when I die...

44
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,914
and I, for one,
don't want to see us staggering around...

45
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,166
with ice cream
slathered all over our faces...

46
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,626
while my soul hangs in the balance.

47
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,420
So until I can find out who sent this,
no one goes near it.

48
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,923
And we're watching The Shining.

49
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,384
I bet Max would let us keep it.

50
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,570
Believe it or not, Shakespeare
probably never intended his plays...

51
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,572
to be read by students sitting at desks...

52
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,576
more concerned with getting 'A's'
than with the fate of Macbeth.

53
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,996
His plays were meant
to be experienced, lived.

54
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,082
So, with that in mind...

55
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,793
together with
my third-period Shakespeare...

56
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,885
you will be split into five groups.

57
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,258
And each group will assume responsibility
for one act of Romeo and Juliet...

58
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,719
which will be performed
a week from Sunday.

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,637
You will nominate the director...

60
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,057
you will cast the scene,
rehearse the scene...

61
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,394
and interpret the scene
in your own individual manner.

62
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:52,191
Last year we did Richard III.
One group did their scene as the Mafiosi.

63
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,152
Another set theirs
during the Roman empire.

64
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,322
And my favorite, the climactic last scene...

65
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,617
was set during the final days
of The Sonny and Cher Show.

66
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,037
Just remember,
whatever interpretation you choose...

67
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,373
should highlight the themes
you see in the scene.

68
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,378
And if the love of the Bard's language
still doesn't inspire you...

69
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:16,507
remember, this will be 50%
of your final grade.

70
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,258
- Act Five.
- Act Five.

71
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,843
- Act Five?
- Act Five.

72
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:24,348
Why don't they sew our sides together
and rename us Chang and Eng?

73
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,186
- Rory.
- Henry, hi.

74
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,939
Act Three, sword fight. You?

75
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:33,357
Act Five, death scene.

76
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,944
- Nice. So, tonight at 8:00?
- I'll tell Lane.

77
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,154
- Rory, sorry to interrupt.
- Hi, Henry.

78
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:43,033
But see, we're all there trying to map out
a game plan and rehearsal schedule...

79
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,577
and I'm sure whatever you two
are talking about here...

80
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:49,164
is so much more fascinating
and important and, let's just say it, fun...

81
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,626
but I'd really like to get an 'A'
on this assignment, and to do that...

82
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:56,004
you'll have to discuss your sock hops
and clambakes some other time.

83
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,673
Okay? Thanks.

84
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,425
That was scary.

85
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,470
It'll be a lot scarier
once she gets a megaphone in her hands.

86
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,264
I say we meet in the cafeteria.

87
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,225
The acoustics are very similar
to Grant Hall, and...

88
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,268
Look who showed up.

89
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,186
- Sorry.
- Save it.

90
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,647
Look who's back from suspension.

91
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,774
Tristin got suspended again?

92
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,359
You hadn't noticed he'd been gone?

93
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,736
- What did he do?
- Took apart Mr. McCaffey's car...

94
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,406
and put it back together
in the science building hallway.

95
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,157
- You're kidding.
- Not by himself.

96
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,659
Duncan and Bowman were there, too.

97
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,995
Plus the mechanics
they paid to do the actual work.

98
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,540
Anyone dumb enough to hang out with
Butch Cassidy and the Sun-dunce Kid...

99
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,251
- deserves whatever they get.
- How'd he fall in with them?

100
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:37,087
The year started, and there they were.
Side by side.

101
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:39,006
And practically dressing the same.

102
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,091
It's very On the Town.

103
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,390
Watch it.

104
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,853
Aunt Bobbie, hi.
It's Lorelai, Richard and Emily's girl.

105
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,605
I'm the one with...

106
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,193
That's right. Wow, you don't
hear the word 'wedlock' much anymore.

107
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,527
I'm home.

108
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,531
Really? The Bible said all that, huh?

109
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:08,327
Did it mention me by name?
I mean, okay, I'm just kidding.

110
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,872
Judging by
your Billy Graham impression...

111
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,458
I am guessing you didn't send me
an ice cream maker...

112
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,669
so maybe you could just give me
Aunt Clarissa's phone number?

113
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,007
No, I hadn't heard. That's terrible.

114
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,802
Then I guess she had it coming,
didn't she?

115
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:29,181
Listen, I'd love to chat about
who else in the family is currently...

116
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,226
or soon to be headed for Hell,
but I've got to run.

117
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,853
I promise to call
in the next 20 years, okay?

118
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,688
Bye-bye.

119
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,943
Scary. My parents are turning out
to be the normal ones in the family.

120
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,946
- No luck?
- I still have the Pennsylvania Gilmores.

121
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,197
How was your day?

122
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,449
I have to perform
Act Five of Romeo and Juliet...

123
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,743
- with Paris, Madeline, and Louise.
- Really?

124
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,286
Paris appointed herself as director.

125
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,580
- Nice. What part are you playing?
- Don't know yet.

126
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,834
She's still mulling over the screen tests.
We'll find out tomorrow.

127
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,877
- Screen tests?
- Twenty-four takes.

128
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:00,838
- I so want a copy.
- Forget it.

129
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,965
Sell it on the Internet. Make a fortune.

130
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,551
'First we brought you
Pamela and Tommy Lee.

131
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,179
'Now prepare yourselves
for the crazy antics of Rory and the Bard!'

132
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,522
I told Paris
you'd make all of our costumes.

133
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,518
She wants to have a concept meeting
with you tomorrow at 3:00.

134
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,602
What?

135
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:20,107
She needs a r�sum� and samples
of your previous work and referrals.

136
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,650
And my bare butt to kiss.

137
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,381
If that'll set you apart
from the other applicants, yes.

138
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,030
I didn't know there was someone
in our family named Bunny.

139
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,657
Cross her off the list.

140
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,492
Poor Bunny.

141
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,873
Hello?

142
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:36,957
Henry, hi.

143
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,041
Am I late?

144
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,710
No, right on time. Hold on.

145
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,468
I'm heading for class.

146
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,047
There's pizza/Luke's money
on the table for dinner.

147
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,299
Thank you.

148
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:50,721
Kim's Antiques.

149
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,599
Hello, Mrs. Kim. This is Rory.
May I please speak with Lane?

150
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,893
- Lane is studying.
- Wait, mama!

151
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,188
- Mama, is that for me?
- Why?

152
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,523
I was just expecting a call from Rory,
and I...

153
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,108
You do your Math? History?

154
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,234
- Biology?
- No.

155
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,987
- Why?
- I'm not taking Biology. I took it last year.

156
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:09,656
That's it? One year and you know
all there is to know?

157
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,491
Tomorrow we look into private school.

158
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,535
Mama, please, the phone?

159
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,746
Five minutes. I'm counting.

160
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:16,997
Hello?

161
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,540
Lane. Hold on.

162
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,460
- Henry?
- Here.

163
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:22,676
- Lane?
- Here.

164
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,379
Okay, guys, talk to you later.

165
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:27,055
So, Rory, how are you?

166
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,967
I'm good. How're you doing?

167
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,761
Okay, I'm gone.

168
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,096
Do me a favor
and make some of those calls for me.

169
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,933
- Aren't you going a little far with this?
- What do you mean?

170
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,185
I know you want to return
the ice cream maker...

171
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:41,730
but you did make an honest effort
to contact the person that sent this...

172
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,274
It's called closure, hon. I need it, okay?

173
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,401
Okay. Uncle Randolph.

174
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,904
Sorry, guys.

175
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,699
- They'll be off in a sec.
- Okay. Don't wait too long.

176
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,118
I think Randolph
was Bunny's older brother.

177
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,245
Got it.

178
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:01,750
Once again, ladies and gentlemen,
she takes the last burrito.

179
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,254
- And hello to you, too.
- Week after week. How do you do it?

180
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,507
I told you, correct change.
Go in for that dollar-bill nonsense...

181
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,468
you'll be standing there for 10 minutes
watching it.

182
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,889
I thought you had a special relationship
with this vending machine.

183
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,183
Only in the sense that it keeps me alive.

184
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,352
I actually have a theory on that.

185
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,897
Ever since we were children,
we got our nourishment from our mothers.

186
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,192
Okay. Are you trying to gross me out
so I can't eat my burrito?

187
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,820
- Now we're getting it from machines.
- Your point being?

188
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,447
It's a conspiracy
getting us ready for the day...

189
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,784
when we'll all be raised by machines.
No human contact whatsoever.

190
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,578
You know my mother, don't you?

191
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,330
The Twilight Zone marathon was on
all week.

192
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:44,042
So all this is a way of saying you want
to look at my notes on the reading.

193
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:47,171
- Such perception.
- And in one so young and beautiful.

194
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:48,262
Frightening, isn't it?

195
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,174
I feel bad doing this every week.

196
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,218
Really? I'd have thought
you'd have gotten used to it by now.

197
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,180
Come on, Lorelai.
I've got to pay you back somehow.

198
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,057
How about you let me take you out
to dinner one night?

199
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,100
Dinner?

200
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:03,020
Maybe even somewhere
that doesn't require correct change.

201
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,899
Unless you're firmly into the coin thing.
Then I know a good Automat.

202
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,110
- I don't know.
- I was kidding about the Automat.

203
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,030
No, an Automat is fine.

204
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:18,076
It's just, my schedule's kind of crazy
for the next couple weeks.

205
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,953
Okay. It was just a thought.

206
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:23,332
But if you suddenly get an opening,
give me a call.

207
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,001
Great. Sure. Thanks.

208
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,631
- Enjoy the notes.
- Thank you. Enjoy the burrito.

209
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,219
We're the Monkees

210
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:37,561
Where's Paris?

211
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,432
She'll be here in a minute.
She said had to get some things.

212
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,685
- Hi. I'm Rory.
- Brad. From third-period Shakespeare.

213
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,855
He's the answer to our
'lack of boys' problem. Isn't that swell?

214
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,525
- Maybe we should start.
- Without Paris?

215
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,984
That could be lethal.

216
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,986
We could decide on what motif
we want to do.

217
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,780
We're doing traditional Elizabethan.

218
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,616
- I thought the point was to...
- The point is to get an 'A'...

219
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,077
not to make Romeo and Juliet
into a Vegas lounge act.

220
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,039
Besides, we have the death scene.
It's classic. It's famous. Who are you?

221
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,457
I'm Brad...

222
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,253
from third-period Shakespeare, ma'am.

223
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,797
I want everyone to read the chapters
on acting...

224
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,424
I photocopied
out of Houseman's memoirs tonight.

225
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,301
Everyone will be off-book by Friday...

226
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:20,430
and if you plan on missing rehearsal,
you'd better bring a coroner's note.

227
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,891
Tell me you didn't just have that
lying around.

228
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:25,202
We're short on boys.
That makes you Romeo.

229
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:27,479
- Louise, you can play the friar.
- Excuse me?

230
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,274
- The gang's all here.
- This is a meeting.

231
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,943
- Sorry I'm late.
- What do you think you're doing?

232
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:36,029
Prof. Anderson forgot to include me
when she made up the groups.

233
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,322
So she told me to pick one.

234
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,450
Fine. You have four other acts
to choose from. Take your pick.

235
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,453
Summer's in Act One,
Beth and Jessica are in Act Two...

236
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,122
Kate's in Act Three...

237
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:49,585
Claire, Cathy and Mary are in Act Four.
This is the only one free of ex-girlfriends.

238
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,087
So we're being punished
for our good taste?

239
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:53,547
Paris, you hurt me.

240
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,716
Do you no longer
have any need for me at all?

241
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,725
Yes, we have great need.
You can be our Romeo.

242
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,555
- Brad is Romeo.
- Put in your other contact, grandma.

243
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,850
Tristin is Romeo.
Brad can be the second guard on the left.

244
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,977
- No.
- She's kind of right, Paris.

245
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,645
Tristin was born to be Romeo.

246
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:12,983
I'm the director and I'll decide who's born
to be what. And Brad is Romeo.

247
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,320
- Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
- What'd you say?

248
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,115
Someone's letting her personal feelings
interfere with her leadership.

249
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:23,327
My only feeling is I don't want to give
the most important part...

250
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:25,621
to someone who can't even manage
to stay in school.

251
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,249
I'm just going to say one thing.
50% of our final grade.

252
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,212
Is there going to be any scratching,
or is it just a verbal thing?

253
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,380
What do you think about this?

254
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,803
How are you at speaking
in front of a lot of people?

255
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,180
I tend to throw up.

256
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,351
Fine. But I swear, you flake on this,
and you'll pray you get suspended.

257
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,646
- I've got to run. Are we done here?
- Rehearsal tomorrow night.

258
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,524
Good. So now Brad can be Friar Tuck,
and I can be Juliet.

259
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,485
Wrong. Juliet's supposed to be chaste.

260
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,821
- Then...
- And she has more than three lines.

261
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,866
No.

262
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,577
- Too late.
- Can't be. We haven't done anything yet.

263
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,080
You're Juliet.
You're the best public speaker here...

264
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,707
you have the waif thing down,
and you'll look great dead.

265
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:11,959
Next order of business.

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,170
I did some location scouting this morning,
and I think the courtyard...

267
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,842
Okay, here we go.
Low-fat whole-wheat blueberry pancakes.

268
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,844
- Are there 12?
- 12 what?

269
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:25,055
Blueberries. I can only have 12 blueberries
for breakfast.

270
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,890
- Or what?
- What do you mean, 'Or what?'

271
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,853
- What happens if you eat 13 blueberries?
- This is a silly conversation.

272
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,230
- Would you die?
- Just hand me the plate.

273
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,275
- Only if you don't count.
- I won't count.

274
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,903
Swear. Raise your right hand and say,
'May Destiny's Child break up...

275
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,322
'if I count these blueberries. '

276
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,992
- Pick another group.
- Nope.

277
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,078
I hate you!

278
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,418
Got to start getting in earlier.

279
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,713
- Hey, I remember you.
- I am donating it to the Inn.

280
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,257
- Honey, that's very thoughtful.
- Yes, it is.

281
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,760
But we have an ice cream maker,
a professional one.

282
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:08,140
It means we can make enough ice cream
for everyone in the Inn...

283
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,517
- whereas this little guy...
- Fernando.

284
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:14,730
Fernando, try as he might,
can only make enough ice cream for you.

285
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,066
- So we don't need him here?
- No, we don't.

286
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,737
Can't you find some use for him?
I mean, he's new and shiny.

287
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,282
It's not his fault he's part of the other life
I almost had...

288
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,160
but don't have now,
and kind of don't want to be reminded of.

289
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,079
- I guess I can put my change in him.
- Thank you.

290
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,415
- Honey, can I say something?
- Shoot.

291
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,126
- I'm a little concerned about you.
- Why?

292
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:39,213
You just seem very emotional
about this ice cream maker.

293
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,548
- I am not.
- You named the ice cream maker.

294
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,635
- I name everything.
- You didn't name the toaster.

295
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,345
Poppy.

296
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,597
- You just made that up.
- I did not.

297
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:52,309
All right, but admit it.
Poppy is a damn good name for a toaster.

298
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,811
It's been quite a while
since you and Max broke up.

299
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:56,897
- I'm fine, Sookie.
- Okay, you're fine.

300
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,024
- But are you moving on?
- Yes, I'm moving on.

301
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,109
How many dates have you had post-Max?

302
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,904
- What's that got to do with anything?
- You're hibernating.

303
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,822
- I'm not hibernating.
- Yes, you are.

304
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,325
Look at this skirt. I'm not hibernating.

305
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,993
Then how many dates have you been on?

306
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,412
I was engaged.
You don't just get over that.

307
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:14,706
But you went through
your mourning period.

308
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:18,502
- And you said it was over.
- It was. Is.

309
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:23,549
Are you at least putting the vibe out there,
so they'll know you're available?

310
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:27,511
If it'll make you feel any better,
I just got asked out the other night.

311
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,680
What? You're kidding. Who is he?

312
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,224
- Some guy from my business class.
- Business class.

313
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,686
He's a pretty cool guy, actually.
He's cute, funny...

314
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,647
He's a little younger, but he's very sharp.

315
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,733
We have this little bit going
about me stealing his burrito.

316
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:44,493
'Stealing his burrito. ' You kids.

317
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:48,156
- No, like a real burrito.
- You've stolen his burrito.

318
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,869
- Okay, forget the burrito.
- Fine. When are you guys going out?

319
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,622
- I didn't exactly say yes.
- Why not? You've already got the skirt.

320
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:59,376
I don't know. What if it doesn't work out?
And the class will be weird...

321
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,753
and it'll definitely screw up our burrito bit.

322
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,638
Honey, come on,
every guy doesn't have to be 'the guy. '

323
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:08,844
- Isn't it too soon for the transition guy?
- Don't think of him as the transition guy.

324
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,054
Think of him as the pre-transition guy.

325
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,891
- Pre-transition guy? You're allowed that?
- Absolutely.

326
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,226
I've got to read
the rule book more carefully.

327
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:20,230
- So?
- So I will call him later tonight.

328
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,232
Great! That's so great!

329
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,613
- It's all or nothing, Sparky.
- Damn you!

330
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,325
She's letting you go? That's amazing.
What changed her mind?

331
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,161
I let her watch Romeo and Juliet
with Leo and Claire Danes.

332
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,996
- I'd have thought she hated it.
- She did.

333
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,082
But trust my mom to turn one
of the world's great love stories...

334
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,794
into a cautionary tale of what happens
when children disobey their parents.

335
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,089
So you're not any closer
to telling your parents about Henry?

336
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,426
What are the options if I tell them?
They hate him, and it's over.

337
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,304
They love him, so he becomes odious
to me, and it's over.

338
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:53,972
Things are fine the way they are.

339
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,808
Calling him Rory on the phone,
in case your mom's listening?

340
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:00,270
I've grown fond of my cage, Rory. Bye.

341
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,734
- What dost my lady think?
- That you're going to be late for the joust?

342
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,113
I meant of thy lovely headdress
crafted by thy mother's artful hand.

343
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:11,538
It pleaseth me mucheth...

344
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,743
but hath my beauteous mother
looked at the time?

345
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,453
Crap.

346
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,133
Two other groups are rehearsing
in the Grant Hall...

347
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,922
even though I reserved it way in advance
and confirmed the reservation twice.

348
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:29,800
They're going to be there,
I don't want them spying on us.

349
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,344
The ending to Romeo and Juliet
isn't exactly a secret.

350
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,436
- Hello, our interpretation?
- Right.

351
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,933
I found a web site called miss-patty. Net.
It's in your town.

352
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,727
- There's a miss-patty. Net?
- Have you heard of it?

353
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,647
Is it big enough?
The site says it's 720 square feet.

354
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,489
I'd rather just rehearse somewhere else.

355
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:49,361
I got enough to be worried about without
you being embarrassed of where you live.

356
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,487
I'm not embarrassed.

357
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,906
I want to keep my school life
and home life separate.

358
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,908
Tough. Madeline and Louise
are on their way.

359
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,702
See you in half an hour.

360
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,209
Have you seen my bag with the beads
and the fur that looks like Stalin's head?

361
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:05,843
- We're rehearsing here now.
- What?

362
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:09,590
Paris didn't want anyone spying on us,
so now we're rehearsing in Stars Hollow.

363
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:10,757
This sucks.

364
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,177
So you don't have to drive to Hartford.
Why the face?

365
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,888
- Tristin is in our group.
- Yeah, you told me.

366
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:19,474
So Tristin, he's in our group,
so that means he's...

367
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,477
And Dean lives here, so this sucks.

368
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,855
Know what? I'm going to need
a few more vowels here.

369
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,231
- I have to tell him.
- Tell who?

370
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:27,566
- Dean.
- Tell Dean what?

371
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:31,195
That Tristin and I,
that we kissed at that stupid party.

372
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,363
I have no choice.

373
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,200
Because if Tristin sees Dean,
he'll tell him...

374
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,369
and then it'll be worse,
because it'll be like I kept it from him.

375
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,371
- Okay, just calm down.
- Which I was.

376
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,750
I was keeping it from him.
I can't believe it. Now I have to tell him.

377
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,585
- You're right.
- I am?

378
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:49,338
- I think you should tell him.
- Of course. I have to.

379
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,133
Then, at the play, right as Tristin enters
to find you dead...

380
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,552
and pulls out the vial of poison
to kill himself...

381
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,263
Dean can leap from the audience
and rip his head off...

382
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,391
adding a level of reality
few productions have seen before.

383
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,852
You'll get an 'A,'
the Actors Studio will go nuts...

384
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,189
you'll have James Lipton asking you
what your favorite swear word is.

385
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,316
- It's a great plan.
- You, not helping.

386
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,527
To prevent a homicide? Yes, I am.

387
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,239
- I have to tell him. I don't have a choice.
- Okay. Fine.

388
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,200
- Try it out on me first.
- What?

389
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,701
Pretend I'm Dean.

390
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:23,163
If you're going to tell him this,
you better have down what you'll say.

391
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,082
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

392
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,883
- Sorry. Serious now.
- Okay, Dean.

393
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,435
Remember last year,
when we had broken up...

394
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,014
and we weren't together anymore
because we'd broken up?

395
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,850
Good, mention it three times. Keep going.

396
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:46,812
There was this party,
and I went, and Tristin was there.

397
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:51,275
And somehow, I'm not really sure how,
we ended up in a room together...

398
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,611
- and we kissed.
- You and Tristin?

399
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,447
- On the hand?
- No.

400
00:19:57,482 --> 00:19:58,532
- Cheek?
- No.

401
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,492
- He kissed you, or you kissed him?
- Both.

402
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:02,161
- So you kissed him?
- Yes.

403
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,663
- When?
- I already told you three times.

404
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:08,000
- When we were broken up.
- Not a good idea to yell at him right now.

405
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,169
- When during the breakup?
- What do you mean?

406
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,880
I mean, how long after we broke up
did you kiss Tristin?

407
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:17,176
- Just the night after we broke up.
- The night after I told you I loved you?

408
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,680
The next night, after I told you I loved you,
you kissed Tristin?

409
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,432
- I'm a terrible person.
- Hold on.

410
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,684
He's absolutely right.
He told me he loved me...

411
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,854
- and the next night, I go and kiss Tristin.
- That was me, not Dean.

412
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,321
- I hate myself.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

413
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,568
You were hurt and confused
and broken up. You did nothing wrong.

414
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,696
- Tell that to Dean.
- We're not telling Dean anything.

415
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:41,533
I know you are Miss Honesty.
I have seen the banner in the closet.

416
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,661
But this kind of honesty
will only make you feel less guilty...

417
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,795
and it's going to hurt Dean very much.

418
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,667
It's possibly going to screw up
the really good thing you have going now.

419
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,711
- Do you want that?
- No, I don't.

420
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:57,299
All right, then. Relax. Be calm.
Everything will be fine.

421
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,219
I've got to go.

422
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,430
Can I ask you one more question?

423
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,850
- Do you think my hair looks cool?
- Bye.

424
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,651
'Cause some days I wake up
and I'm, like, 'Cool. '

425
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,481
- Some days, I'm, like, 'Could be cooler. '
- I won't wait up for you.

426
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:17,277
Today I got up and I was, like,
'Left side cool, right side not so cool. '

427
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,612
Bye.

428
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:25,869
Just listen to your breathing
and let the world melt away.

429
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,955
And in.

430
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,166
And out.

431
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:40,551
Excuse me. We reserved this place
for 8:00 sharp, and my watch says 8:04.

432
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:45,097
Tell it to go outside and have a smoke.
You can't rush a cool-down, sweetheart.

433
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:48,225
I understand the whole
Mystic Pizza, small-town...

434
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,227
we-don't-let-a-clock-run-our-lives thing.

435
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:52,354
But I come from the big city,
where money talks.

436
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,691
I'm paying good money for this place,
and I have a schedule to keep.

437
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:59,236
Be careful, darling, or your face
is going to freeze like that.

438
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,738
What's with the cast from Cocoon?

439
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,991
Where's Tristin?
He said he was coming with you.

440
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,034
He's here.
He just went over to the market.

441
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,536
- What?
- He needed cigarettes...

442
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,913
in case we didn't know that he was bad.

443
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:11,165
I'll be right back.

444
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,750
- Where are you going?
- I'll just be a sec.

445
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,212
Okay, now they're just sleeping.

446
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:21,466
Excuse me, stock boy, could you tell me
where I could find the shortening?

447
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:26,013
Now that is a fine-looking apron.
I mean, really sensational.

448
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,681
What are you doing here?

449
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:31,018
To be honest,
there's something I wanted to ask you.

450
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:35,731
In your professional opinion,
which one would make my cakes fluffier?

451
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,066
You drove all the way here
just to be a jerk?

452
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,944
There aren't enough people
who can't stand you in Hartford?

453
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,738
- I'm here for Rory.
- What?

454
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,574
- The play, Romeo and Juliet?
- What about it?

455
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:49,786
I'm Romeo. She's Juliet.
Come on, she must have told you.

456
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:54,208
- She did tell you, didn't she?
- I think you'd better leave.

457
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,213
I am so sorry. I am such a klutz.

458
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,090
Here. On me. This should cover it.

459
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:06,303
You know what? I hope for Rory's sake
that you got an understudy.

460
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,680
- Hi. I need to talk to you.
- What is he doing here?

461
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,642
- I got something to settle with this guy.
- Outside, please.

462
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,727
All right! I'm outside.

463
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:18,982
- Sorry I didn't tell you before, but Tristin...
- Is playing Romeo to your Juliet. I heard.

464
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,653
He wasn't even in our group at first,
then no one else wanted him...

465
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:26,490
then Paris moved our rehearsal to here,
and I didn't have time to tell you.

466
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,659
You and Tristin get thrown together a lot.

467
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,119
It's just a project, that's all. Nothing more.

468
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:35,374
You and Tristin playing Romeo and Juliet?
Perfect. Really amazing.

469
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,001
- I know you hate it.
- Yeah, I really hate it.

470
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,135
But we do the scene on Sunday,
then it's over.

471
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,756
And it's back to,
'Tristin? Who? I don't know Tristin. '

472
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,801
You must mean that young boy
who got mysteriously strangled...

473
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,263
- by a Doose's Market apron one night.
- I heard about that.

474
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,932
Awful. They say drugs were involved.

475
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:56,311
Please, don't be mad. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

476
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:59,856
Sorry about what?
You didn't choose to do this with him.

477
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:03,151
- No, I didn't.
- Then what do you have to be sorry for?

478
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:07,364
That I didn't tell you about the rehearsal.

479
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,159
And that No Doubt is touring with U2.

480
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,703
I know you're extremely disappointed
in Bono.

481
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:15,831
- All right, so when's this thing over?
- Sunday.

482
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:24,214
I'm going to walk around the block.
Just get him out of the market.

483
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:25,674
Right away.

484
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,724
Thank goodness you ordered.
I am starving.

485
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:36,226
What are you doing here?
I thought you went to dinner.

486
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,854
- I did go out to dinner.
- Then why are you eating mine?

487
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:41,565
He took me to this darling little place
called Mini's.

488
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,902
- Very hip, very chic, very small portions.
- So how'd it go?

489
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:49,156
We talked about the things we had
in common, and then the salad came.

490
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:52,201
- Not a soul mate?
- He's never seen Abfab.

491
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,078
Plus, he's outdoorsy.
Remember that Meryl Streep movie...

492
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,372
where she and her family
take a rafting trip...

493
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,542
and psycho Kevin Bacon forces them
to take him down the river?

494
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,420
That's his dream vacation,
minus Kevin Bacon.

495
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:06,173
Whereas mine is Kevin Bacon,
minus the river.

496
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,591
Moving on.

497
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:10,344
But I must say,
I'm really glad I went tonight.

498
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:14,598
It was fun to kind of get dressed up...

499
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,976
and have a freshly laundered man
open the door for me.

500
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:21,104
And the best part about it was,
it was no big deal.

501
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,983
We laughed a little, we hugged good night.
I'll never date him again.

502
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:29,613
But I do believe the burrito bit will live on.
It was a totally casual date.

503
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,033
- I am now officially a casual dater.
- That's great.

504
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:36,411
We can celebrate by getting you
your own plate of fries.

505
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:39,790
- Luke, can we get another round?
- Coming right up.

506
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:43,293
- So tell me about the big rehearsal.
- We got off to a shaky start.

507
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,630
Louise acts like she's the priest
in a Madonna video.

508
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:49,383
- But by the end we were not half bad.
- Good.

509
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,219
- Tristin ran into Dean.
- Bad.

510
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,806
I pulled them apart without bloodshed
and explained it all to Dean.

511
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,224
You explained it all to Dean?

512
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,852
I told him Tristin wasn't supposed to be
in our group...

513
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,813
and Paris moved the rehearsal
to Miss Patty's at the last minute...

514
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,523
and that's why didn't know about it.

515
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:06,316
That version of 'all. '

516
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,534
- But Dean's fine now?
- He's fine.

517
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,572
- You want a burger, too?
- No, I'll just have half of hers.

518
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,615
- One burger, please.
- You look all dressed up.

519
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:16,076
Do I? Because I feel very casual.

520
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,540
- Hey.
- Hi.

521
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,542
- You just get off work?
- Yep.

522
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,503
- Do you want some fries?
- No, I'm going home for dinner.

523
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:29,381
My mom made fried chicken,
and she saved me some.

524
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,550
- You have a cooking mom.
- That's so nice.

525
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,553
She may make chicken,
but is she a casual dater?

526
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,846
I hope not. She's married.

527
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,056
Do I want to know
what you're talking about?

528
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,684
- Nope.
- My mother casually dated tonight.

529
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,478
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

530
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,481
I was just wondering
what time rehearsal is tomorrow.

531
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:47,691
Why?

532
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:50,861
It's my night off,
and I thought maybe I'd come and watch.

533
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:52,529
- Watch what?
- Watch you.

534
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,032
- Watch me do what?
- Rehearse.

535
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,496
I think you'd be really bored
watching rehearsal.

536
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:03,499
I've dozed off twice just listening
to her talk about rehearsal.

537
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:04,708
I won't be bored.

538
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,252
We don't know our lines yet.
You should come on Sunday.

539
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:10,339
Good idea.
After all, Sunday's the day of rest...

540
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,509
and that's what you'll be doing.
Resting. Because it's boring.

541
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:16,178
It's not your fault.
You didn't write the damn thing.

542
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,686
I'll come on Sunday, too.

543
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:21,475
But if you're going to go on Sunday,
you don't want to spoil it for yourself.

544
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,193
- It's not like I don't know how it ends.
- Okay, look.

545
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,814
Rory, I'll sit in the back,
you'll die, and I'll walk you home.

546
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,900
- It's no big deal, right?
- Right.

547
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,152
Good. So I'll see you tomorrow.

548
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:34,071
Yep, you sure will.

549
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,281
- Bye, Lorelai.
- Bye, Dean.

550
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,579
Oh, yeah. He's fine.

551
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,962
Excuse me, Tristin,
can I talk to you for a second?

552
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,756
I'll meet you guys later, okay?

553
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,050
I'm all yours.

554
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:58,554
- I need talk about something serious.
- Serious? I'm intrigued.

555
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:01,014
Dean's coming to rehearsal tonight.

556
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:04,518
Are you sure they can spare him?
What if there's a run on baked beans?

557
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,105
Can't you shut up for five seconds,
please? Thank you.

558
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,191
As I said, Dean's coming
to rehearsal tonight...

559
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:14,903
and I'd like you to promise you won't say
anything about what happened.

560
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,780
- What happened?
- At the party?

561
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:20,742
- At the party?
- You and me, at Madeline's party?

562
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,995
You had been kicked to the curb
by Summer...

563
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:26,498
and I found you sulking on a piano bench,
and I sat down, we talked...

564
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:29,084
and then we kissed.

565
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:32,212
- That was you?
- You know what? Forget it.

566
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:34,798
Hey, Rory...

567
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:38,802
There's no point in talking to you.
I knew, yet I tried. Won't happen again.

568
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:41,013
You don't want me to tell Dean
that we kissed.

569
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:42,437
By George, I think he's got it.

570
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,100
- Okay, if that's what you want.
- It is.

571
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,832
- Although he's going to find out anyway.
- What?

572
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:50,425
Come on,
you know that when we kiss on stage...

573
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,983
it's going to be obvious
it's not the first time.

574
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,868
I'm a good actor,
but I can't hide that kind of passion.

575
00:28:55,903 --> 00:29:00,449
Things are really good for me and Dean,
and I don't want anything to mess that up.

576
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:03,035
Especially not something
that meant nothing to me...

577
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,954
and I wish had never happened
in the first place.

578
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,957
- So things are going good for you two?
- Yeah, they are.

579
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,834
Good. That's good.

580
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,465
So what do you think?

581
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,176
- You just took those out.
- I changed my mind.

582
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:20,302
Are you all right?

583
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:24,097
I think I'll recover from the great romance
between you and the Beav.

584
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,767
A lot of stuff's been going on
with you lately, huh?

585
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,060
Meaning?

586
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:31,313
The car thing, the suspension thing.
A lot of drama.

587
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,190
I get bored easily.

588
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:36,360
- Just doesn't really seem like you.
- And you know me?

589
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:38,570
I know you don't get suspended
for dumb pranks.

590
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:41,365
I pulled stuff like that
before I knew Duncan and Bowman.

591
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:44,368
If you did, you didn't get caught.
You're getting caught a lot.

592
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:45,410
Your point being?

593
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:47,746
They aren't the best people
to be hanging out with.

594
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:50,916
They're not as smart as you.
They don't have what you have going.

595
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,211
I have to bail,
before we get to the hugging part.

596
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,423
And ask your boyfriend to remind me
when it's coupon day, okay?

597
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:04,721
- Taking pity on your burger?
- I'm not hungry.

598
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,432
You're going to kill yourself
in a couple of hours.

599
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:09,017
You really need your strength.

600
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,603
- Maybe Dean won't even come tonight.
- He'll be there.

601
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:15,148
There aren't enough monster-truck rallies
in the world to keep him away.

602
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:18,318
All right. That's it.
This afternoon, we are going to engage...

603
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,363
in some intensive retail therapy
to bring you out of this funk.

604
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,865
- No, thanks.
- I mean it.

605
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:26,743
Today is the day we finally spring
for the Powerpuff Girls shot glasses.

606
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:30,080
I can't. I promised Lane I'd help her
pick out an outfit for the play.

607
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,214
- Lorelai?
- Yes?

608
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,502
Hey, it is you! This is Lorelai.
She's the girl I told you about.

609
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:39,464
Paul! I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you with the hat.

610
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:41,967
- What are you doing here?
- Getting some coffee.

611
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,051
In Stars Hollow?

612
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:46,722
You talked so much about the town
the other night, especially Luke's place.

613
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,850
My mom's crazy for coffee.
I thought I'd bring them for breakfast.

614
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:53,437
- The other night?
- PauI's referring to the casual Wednesday.

615
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,399
- I want you to meet my daughter, Rory.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

616
00:30:57,434 --> 00:31:00,110
- These are my parents, Dory and Sid.
- Nice to meet you.

617
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:01,862
- Pleasure, really.
- Yeah, me, too.

618
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:03,822
- You ordering?
- Luke?

619
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,325
- Are you Luke? Is this Luke?
- Yes, that's Luke.

620
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,996
- Oh, man! Mom, Dad, that is Luke.
- We heard so much about you.

621
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,123
Darn shame about that Rachel.

622
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:17,044
- Who the hell are these people?
- Paul is my friend from business school.

623
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,295
We went out the other night.

624
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:22,049
She talked about a few people
in this town, you being one of them.

625
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,759
So, nice to meet you.

626
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,801
Yeah.

627
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,513
Three coffees to go, then.

628
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:28,931
- Something funny?
- No.

629
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,642
- You're smiling for no reason?
- I'm a happy person.

630
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:33,852
I've got to run.
Mom wants to go antiquing.

631
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:37,481
So it was nice meeting you.
And I'll see you in class, Lorelai.

632
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,238
- What? Say it!
- Nothing.

633
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:47,491
- I always wanted a little brother.
- He looked older the other night.

634
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,827
- How much older could he possibly look?
- A lot.

635
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:53,831
He's usually scruffy. The baseball cap
hides the funky-hair thing.

636
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,166
He should have been holding a yo-yo,
a lollipop...

637
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:58,168
and wearing a beanie
with a propeller on it.

638
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,468
He's in his 20s.

639
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,422
He must have been a very good boy
to deserve such a happy day.

640
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:05,843
- I bet they let him ride a pony.
- Aren't you supposed to go help Lane?

641
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,845
Thanks for cheering me up.

642
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,433
- What? You want to say something, too?
- No.

643
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,602
- Don't hold back on my account.
- I wouldn't.

644
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:17,771
Would you guys mind moving down
a couple stools?

645
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:19,439
It'd make me more comfortable.

646
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:22,484
- This is me leaving.
- I want to know what the cutoff is.

647
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,944
And no tip. I wonder why.

648
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:27,531
If you had one of those height bars,
like at amusement-park rides...

649
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:28,574
Bye, now.

650
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,368
Here's to my love.

651
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:38,125
O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.

652
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:40,752
Line.

653
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,089
'Thus with a kiss I die. '
How hard is that to remember?

654
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:47,384
'Thus with a kiss I die. ' Right.
And then I kiss her, right?

655
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:51,722
Yes, you say, 'Thus with a kiss I die,'
then you kiss her and die.

656
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,433
Why are you smiling?
Do you think this is a joke?

657
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,144
- The performance is tomorrow.
- Wait, tomorrow?

658
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:00,334
My God! I totally missed it
the first 47 times you said it.

659
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:03,275
I warned you. I am not going to fail this
because of you.

660
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,403
- I will replace you with Brad in a second.
- Dear God, no.

661
00:33:06,438 --> 00:33:08,864
- Can we just get through the scene?
- Please.

662
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:11,783
Fine. But yell 'line' once more,
and you're out.

663
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,535
Start memorizing.

664
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:17,206
O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.

665
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:20,000
Thus with a kiss I die.

666
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:26,507
- What?
- It's just...

667
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:30,260
With this being our last kiss,
it makes me think about our first kiss.

668
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:33,347
- You know, at the party.
- What?

669
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,183
- Lie down, you're dead.
- We all are.

670
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,851
You remember the kiss.

671
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,771
In Act One, at the Capulets' masked party.

672
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:41,862
What about it?

673
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:45,859
I was trying to think of something
that would make this kiss as special.

674
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,486
- I thought she could cry.
- What?

675
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:50,572
- She's dead. You're dead. Lie down.
- But that's the beauty of it.

676
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,741
- No one would expect her to cry.
- I would.

677
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,828
- Funny you should say that.
- I need to take five.

678
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:56,954
Let's all take five.

679
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:59,498
That way, you can all cancel
whatever plans you had...

680
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,793
because we are staying here
until we get this right.

681
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,962
Who could you possibly be calling?

682
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:07,464
He is unbelievable.

683
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:10,349
- Dean, I really need you to leave.
- What?

684
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:13,720
The play's tomorrow,
and it's 50% of my grade...

685
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:17,516
and you standing there staring at Tristin,
it's like a challenge.

686
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:19,608
I don't like the way he's messing with you.

687
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,145
I don't either,
but we have to get through the scene...

688
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:26,149
and we can't with you standing there,
so, Dean, please?

689
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,318
Fine.

690
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:31,905
Call me later.

691
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:40,434
You know, I notice you didn't cry
when you kissed him.

692
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,298
- I'm starting to feel insecure.
- What is wrong with you?

693
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,920
- I think I liked you better comatose.
- You weren't going to say anything.

694
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,137
Did I say that?

695
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,841
You make it impossible
for anyone to be nice to you.

696
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,342
No wonder you had to join our group.

697
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:56,346
Anyone who's suffered the experience
of going out with you would know better.

698
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,933
I really wish we could continue
your analysis on how pathetic I am.

699
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:03,061
Unfortunately,
I have to meet some friends.

700
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:05,939
Where are you going? Where is he going?

701
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:08,692
We're not finished! I'm the director here!

702
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,320
Tristin, come back!

703
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:19,912
I'm so excited.
Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet.

704
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:22,956
It's so romantic. 'Oh, Romeo... '

705
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,630
That's all the Shakespeare I know.

706
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,007
You should come with us
and watch Rory perform.

707
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,133
Can't.

708
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,261
How often do you get to see teenagers
speak iambic pentameter...

709
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,896
- and kill themselves?
- No, thanks. But have a good time.

710
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:42,100
Bring plenty of baseball cards
to pass out your phone number on.

711
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,978
Enough already! The horse is dead.

712
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,898
His ashes have been sprinkled
over the land. Let it rest.

713
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,443
Lorelai, there you are, you naughty girl.

714
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:55,239
He was not that much younger than I am.

715
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,908
I met him at business school,
not his bar mitzvah.

716
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,953
Business school has to indicate
some kind of maturity, right?

717
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:04,081
- Doogie Howser was a doctor at 16.
- Doogie Howser was not real.

718
00:36:04,116 --> 00:36:05,415
How sad for you.

719
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:10,629
This is incredible. I go on one stupid date,
and I'm the female Jerry Lee Lewis.

720
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:15,342
Forget it, honey. The town likes to tease.
Plus, he did look really young.

721
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:18,136
- You didn't even see him.
- Kirk snapped pictures.

722
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:24,101
- Hey, you. What is up with you?
- Nothing's up with me.

723
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:26,812
We were having
a perfectly nasty verbal sparring match...

724
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:29,523
- and you suddenly walk away?
- I hear you're dating a kid.

725
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:31,400
Please, let something big fall on my head.

726
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:34,820
When I was 18, I was dating
an older lady. Broke my heart.

727
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:37,948
I'm sorry you got dumped,
but I'm not dating a kid.

728
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,451
I didn't get dumped. She died.
Heart attack. She was quite old.

729
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:45,622
- I'm working. Us older guys do that.
- Why are you being so mean to me?

730
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,000
- I'm not being mean.
- Yes, you are.

731
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,168
Am I being mean?

732
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:52,504
I wouldn't pay you to put on a red nose
and work a birthday party now.

733
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:53,547
Thank God for that.

734
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,341
- Why are you so mad at me?
- I just think it's embarrassing.

735
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:59,469
- What is so embarrassing?
- You running around with that kid.

736
00:36:59,504 --> 00:37:02,055
I wasn't running. He's not a kid.
We had dinner.

737
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:04,099
Say 'Chuck E. Cheese,'
I'll break your nose.

738
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:07,019
I'm not going to say anything.
Live your life as you please.

739
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,770
I got work to do.

740
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:17,112
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

741
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:20,824
But soft! What light
through yonder window breaks?

742
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,453
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

743
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,664
- Are you sure this is Shakespeare?
- What's with all the grunting?

744
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:30,375
I wish Luke was here.
He could translate for us.

745
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,794
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

746
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:34,922
Look at you. You look like a princess.

747
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,507
Doesn't she look like a princess?

748
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:39,009
- Yeah, she looks beautiful.
- Mom made the dress.

749
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,595
- Not to mention the girl inside it.
- Hello! Gross!

750
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,972
- I'm just saying.
- I'm getting kind of nervous.

751
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,308
- You're going to be great.
- Act Three is starting.

752
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,108
Henry's act. How do I look?

753
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:52,314
You might want to hold a phone
up to your face, so he'll recognize you.

754
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,191
I need you.

755
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,527
- He's not here.
- Who's not here?

756
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:59,905
I've called his home, his cell.
I called three girls he's seeing.

757
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,865
- Calm down.
- Weren't you listening?

758
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:04,993
He's not here. We're on in 20 minutes,
and we don't have a Romeo.

759
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,662
- We are going to fail.
- We're not.

760
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:09,373
Do you think Harvard accepts people
who fail Shakespeare?

761
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:12,251
I don't have numbers on it,
but I feel secure in saying...

762
00:38:12,286 --> 00:38:14,419
you fail Shakespeare,
you don't get into Harvard.

763
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,839
Maybe he's in one
of the bathrooms, smoking.

764
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:20,467
You check the east men's rooms,
I'll check the west ones.

765
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:31,061
I am hurt. A plague on both your houses!

766
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:34,565
I am sped. Is he gone, and hath nothing?

767
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,484
I knew he was going to do this,
but no one wanted to listen.

768
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,320
- 'Let's make Tristin Romeo. He's hot. '
- What about Brad?

769
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,573
Brad transferred schools.
Where have you been?

770
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,575
Get dressed. We're on in 10 minutes.

771
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:45,909
- Can't.
- What?

772
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,579
My dad had me pulled out of school.

773
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,416
And is she unhappy.

774
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,460
What do you mean,
he had you pulled out of school?

775
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:58,380
Just ticked the old man off, that's all.

776
00:38:58,415 --> 00:39:01,258
By doing what? Tristin, come on, tell me.

777
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:02,759
I got in some trouble.

778
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:06,013
- Trouble involving...
- Involving Duncan and Bowman.

779
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:09,266
- And Bowman's dad's safe.
- Oh, no.

780
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:12,769
Bowman had a key.
It was supposed to be no big deal.

781
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:17,274
- Then the crazy silent alarm kicked in.
- You broke into Bowman's dad's safe?

782
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,151
- Yes.
- Stupid.

783
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,573
Okay. You can apologize,
and you can put back the money...

784
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:27,659
and you can explain
that you were going through something.

785
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:30,537
I was. I was going through his safe.

786
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:33,123
- Why would you do this?
- I don't know.

787
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:35,792
I guess that's something I can ponder
at military school.

788
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:37,085
Military school?

789
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,171
The police
are letting our parents handle it.

790
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:42,424
In my case, that means military school
in North Carolina.

791
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:43,932
I don't know what to say.

792
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:48,388
I imagine you're overwhelmed at the relief
in knowing that soon I will be gone.

793
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:50,557
I'm so sorry.

794
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:54,019
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

795
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:56,313
- There's nothing you can...
- Tristin...

796
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,648
come on.

797
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:01,693
I've got to go.

798
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,701
I'd like to kiss you goodbye...

799
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,622
but your boyfriend's watching.

800
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:18,001
Take care of yourself, Mary.

801
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:27,553
What are you standing there for? Let's go!

802
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:30,556
And you better start sucking on an Altoid.

803
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:33,684
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

804
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:37,479
Come, bitter conduct.
Come, unsavory guide.

805
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:40,774
Thou desperate pilot, now at once
run on the dashing rocks...

806
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:43,861
thy seasick weary bark. Here's to my love!

807
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:52,244
O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.

808
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:54,955
Thus with a kiss...

809
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:56,957
I die.

810
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:03,213
Wasn't that great?
Just watching it made me feel smarter.

811
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:06,008
- Don't you feel smarter?
- Just the opposite, actually.

812
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:09,219
Let's do something else good for us.
Go to a museum or play chess.

813
00:41:09,254 --> 00:41:10,762
I promised Rory we'd go to Luke's.

814
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,097
Even better.

815
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:15,726
I am still pretty peeved
by how he acted earlier.

816
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,728
- That guy runs so hot and cold on me.
- What?

817
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:21,690
One minute, he's all sweet.
The next, he's being a total jerk...

818
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:24,401
- for God knows what reason.
- For God knows what reason?

819
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:26,570
- Come on, Lorelai.
- What?

820
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,406
Don't you understand
that Luke is so into you?

821
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,532
Okay, stop.

822
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:33,368
He has had to watch you go
from one guy to another...

823
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:35,996
and then the engagement,
and then it was off.

824
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:39,416
And patiently, he's waited,
and now in walks this kid...

825
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:42,544
and he says, 'My God,
will she date anyone else in the world...

826
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,838
- 'before she'll date me?'
- Sookie, that's...

827
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:48,091
Maybe it's crazy, maybe it's irrational,
but it's there.

828
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:50,969
Just look the guy in the eye.
It's right there.

829
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:57,392
So did you and Paris actually kiss,
or was that, like, a stage thing?

830
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:59,603
A lady never kisses and tells.

831
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:02,231
You guys get a table. I'll be right there.

832
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,488
How'd it go?

833
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:13,283
- I think Shakespeare will recover.
- That's good.

834
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:16,787
- Are you good at dating?
- What?

835
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:19,248
Dating. Do you have that down?

836
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:23,377
- Okay, if this is about that kid...
- It's not about anything. It's a question.

837
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,128
I don't know if I have it down.

838
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:28,841
Considering I live with my nephew,
I'd say probably not.

839
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,634
I don't have it down either.

840
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:34,054
I've never been very good at it.
Never even really liked it.

841
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:38,016
It's too much 'what if. '
I like things I can count on.

842
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:44,857
Actually, with Max, it was the first time
I was finally like:

843
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:48,819
'Here it is. That one person
who will always be there for me. '

844
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,323
And then I turned around,
and it's suddenly:

845
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:56,160
'Wrong. '

846
00:42:57,828 --> 00:43:00,747
- 'Keep moving. '
- Why are you telling me this?

847
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:03,709
I don't have very many people in my life...

848
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,670
who are in my life...

849
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:09,923
permanently, forever.

850
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:13,760
They will always be there for me.
I will always be there for them.

851
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:19,975
There's Rory and Sookie, this town...

852
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:22,269
and you.

853
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:26,356
- I mean, at least I think I've got...
- You do.

854
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:28,275
Good.

855
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,612
Just checking.

856
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:36,950
Tell me about Romeo and Juliet.

857
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:43,749
It's so depressing. Everybody dies.
But the clothes were so cute.

858
00:43:43,784 --> 00:43:46,668
- Life can be funny that way.
- And Rory...

859
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:27,876
English
