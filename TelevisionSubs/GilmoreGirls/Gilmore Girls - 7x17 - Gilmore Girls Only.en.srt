1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:02,323
- Ah, Moon pies.
- What?

2
00:00:02,353 --> 00:00:05,324
Well, it's the wonderful part of a
road-trip. Stopping for Moon pies.

3
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:06,565
Mom, I want to go. I can't.

4
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:09,389
I know. I know.
End of semester -- lots of work.

5
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:10,969
Not lots -- tons. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:12,105
Yeah, yeah.

7
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:13,982
- It's just --
- What "it's just"?

8
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:16,279
Well, it's just, you know, a shame

9
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,453
to miss the wedding of a woman
who meant so much to you.

10
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:21,380
Mom, I talked to Mia.
I apologized profusely.

11
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:24,861
I told her that it was simply impossible
for me to drop everything now

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,455
and go to North Carolina.
No, right?

13
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:27,599
- No.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,501
- She totally understood.
- Of course, she understood.

15
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:32,851
She understood when I was 17
and I arrived at the Inn,

16
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:34,961
holding a little,
tiny baby in my arms,

17
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:36,493
and rain was pouring down.

18
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:37,862
As long as you're
not milking this.

19
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:41,423
And she understood when you broke that
teacup of hers, the english rose pattern

20
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:42,842
- when you were 4.
- Okay, mom.

21
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,321
Yeah, I think that was an antique,
wasn't it? But, oh, she understood.

22
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:48,293
Hello. Statute of limitations.

23
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:51,741
You know why? Because she is an
understanding, kind, and loving woman

24
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:52,863
who loves you.

25
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:53,990
That's cute.

26
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:55,041
Yeah?

27
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:56,182
Yeah.

28
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:59,691
I don't know if "cute" is what I'm going
for on an interview for a newspaper, but...

29
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:01,893
Worked for Brenda Starr.
Worked for Lois Lane.

30
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:04,712
So if I get a job as a journalist
in a comic strip, this is the one.

31
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:08,253
Oh, do you remember when we used to
do road trips when you were little,

32
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:09,713
- and we'd play "I spy"?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:09,747 --> 00:01:12,033
And you'd say,
"I spy something with four wheels."

34
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:14,722
And I'd be like, "is it a cow?"
'Cause that's funny and fun.

35
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:16,360
- Mom.
- Road trips are so fun.

36
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,421
They are fun,
but I don't feel like I can go,

37
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:20,823
especially with Logan
freaking out on me right now.

38
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,453
He's running off to Vegas,
coming home drunk, giving me attitude,

39
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:25,022
- not calling his dad back.
- Still?

40
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:27,073
Yes, and while I'm mad at him,
because he's acting this way,

41
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:29,952
I just feel like he's going through
something and I should be there for him.

42
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:32,610
Oh, honey, I get it.
I really do.

43
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:35,623
You know, I want to take back the
"cute." That's really growing on me.

44
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:37,281
- It's very you.
- Really?

45
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:40,390
Yeah, it's very grown-up.
It reeks of gravitas.

46
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:42,023
It screams New York Times.

47
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,233
Well, I need it to say more than that.
I'm hoping to hear

48
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:47,690
from the San Francisco Chronicle, the
Seattle Times, the Detroit Free Press.

49
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:50,012
Well, honey,
you can't ask one suit to say so much.

50
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,602
Why don't you just get the suit
that says something local?

51
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:55,592
'Cause those other cities are
so far away, so expensive,

52
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:56,783
- so tiring.
- I know.

53
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:00,161
And plus, you know you can get a
good cup of coffee in New York.

54
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:03,340
I don't know about those other cities.
They have crappy coffee.

55
00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:04,632
You mean like Seattle?

56
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,820
Oh! Waffle Ranch.

57
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:07,932
Missing the connection.

58
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:09,852
Gosh, I drove through
North Carolina once,

59
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:12,851
and they have the most wonderful
chain called "Waffle Ranch."

60
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:15,932
Mom, it's not so much
about the road-trip food.

61
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,193
Waffle Ranch kicks Ihop's butt.

62
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:20,822
How come you weren't so
desperate to have me come along

63
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,892
when we got the invitation
two months ago?

64
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:25,503
Because two months ago,
I knew you would play the homework card,

65
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:28,441
so I planned to do this road-trip
with your dad -- just him and me.

66
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:29,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

67
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:34,093
Are you sorry enough to make
it up to me by going with me?

68
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,453
I really wish I could.

69
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:37,723
- Hey, that's a winner.
- Really?

70
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:40,090
Yeah, I think you could stun
them in any newspaper interview.

71
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,571
- It is a stunning suit, isn't it?
- Yep. It sure is.

72
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:44,982
They might like you so much
that they take your picture

73
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:47,133
and put it in the insert
for the macy's one day sale.

74
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:48,503
- You really like it?
- I really do.

75
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,862
But you shouldn't take my word for it.
You need a group. A consensus.

76
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:53,253
There would be a great
group at Mia's wedding.

77
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:55,002
- Nice try.
- Oh, god.

78
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,193
Hey, you're up.

79
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:51,722
The shower woke me.

80
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:53,572
Sorry. I'm heading
over to the library.

81
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:56,640
I have a ton of reading to catch up on.
So I thought I'd get an early start.

82
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,493
- Cool.
- You doing some work?

83
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,973
No, just looking for
something on Youtube.

84
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:06,723
You got to see this. Finn posted
a video he shot on his cellphone

85
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:09,082
when we were in Vegas.
It's pretty outrageous.

86
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,922
You going in to
the office today?

87
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:12,733
I doubt it.
Colin and Finn are coming over.

88
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:14,122
What are you guys gonna do?

89
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:15,843
Hang, probably.

90
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:18,380
You know, Logan,
I think after the library,

91
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,583
I'm gonna catch a train
back to New Haven.

92
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:21,880
Good enough.

93
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:31,752
- Oh, hi.
- Rory.

94
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,050
Um, Logan's...

95
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:38,813
So, it does work.

96
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,690
And I can assume you can get cellphone
reception wherever the hell you've been.

97
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:44,083
I was gonna call.

98
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:46,332
I was just waiting until I
figured out my next move.

99
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:49,123
Next move. I'm fascinated, Logan.
What is this next move?

100
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:52,142
And where were you figuring it out --
by the pool, the slot machines?

101
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,010
- You've been spying on me?
- After what you pulled,

102
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:56,613
you can bet I'm gonna be spying
on you for the rest of your life.

103
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:58,031
- I need some time.
- You know what you need, Logan?

104
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,930
You need to get dressed, get cleaned up,
and get your ass down to the office

105
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,210
so you can hear what's
been figured out for you!

106
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:04,961
I'm not just another
one of your employees.

107
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,213
Damn right you're not.

108
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:08,723
If you were just another one of my
employees, you'd be fired by now.

109
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:11,140
Steven, Barry and Legal
are gonna sit you down,

110
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,030
try and sort out
the mess you made.

111
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,681
Can you be there in an hour?

112
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:27,373
And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
Mitchum Huntzberger, class-A jerk.

113
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:28,271
Can you believe him?

114
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:29,133
No.

115
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:30,303
I mean...

116
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:33,602
- What?
- He was a jerk. He is a jerk.

117
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:34,721
But?

118
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:38,421
Uh, well, Logan, far be it for
me to agree with your father,

119
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,993
but you have been kind
of irresponsible.

120
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:45,241
Okay, you know what?
This is really weird.

121
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,510
What -- that I'm being honest?

122
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,703
No, that you're on his side. I kind
of expected a little support here.

123
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:52,162
Logan, I love you,
but I'm not gonna support

124
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:54,182
every stupid thing
that you do, okay?

125
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:56,333
If you go rob a bank,
what do you expect me to do?

126
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:59,083
Say, "oh, that's okay, honey.
I support you, darling"?

127
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:01,762
I screwed up. I admit it. What do you
people want -- a freaking pound of flesh?

128
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,140
What -- "you people"?

129
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:06,490
Logan, for me, it's not that your
business deal got messed up, okay?

130
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:07,771
It's what you've
done since then.

131
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,621
- What have I done?
- Nothing.

132
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:13,320
That's exactly my point.
You've not been facing the problem.

133
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:15,630
- You've been running from it.
- I was going crazy, Rory.

134
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:18,132
I had to blow off steam.
I'm trying to get my bearings here.

135
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:21,302
I don't see you trying to get your
bearings. I see you hiding out,

136
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,720
and people are counting on you,
your dad included.

137
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,592
And you're not facing your
responsibilities. You're --

138
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:29,440
- You are being a jerk.
- Well, maybe that's who I am.

139
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:31,360
Maybe I'm a jerk like my dad.
You ever think of that?

140
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:32,942
I'm starting to.

141
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:40,811
I highly recommend the
cream of wheat today, ma'am.

142
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:43,591
I don't know what it's spiked with,
but it's insane.

143
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:48,380
We got a truckload of that cream of wheat
back there, so I'm pushing it like crazy.

144
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:50,271
You're one sly waiter, Zach.

145
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,465
Not so fast.
Got a little snafu with my order.

146
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:54,529
I don't see a snafu.

147
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,751
And that is why Lane is
the pro at this job,

148
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:58,452
and you will always
be the amateur.

149
00:06:58,488 --> 00:07:00,743
Dude, I don't have a problem with that.
What's wrong with the order?

150
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,313
Grilled-cheese platter comes
with french fries and pickles.

151
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:05,303
- Which I'm looking at.
- Look a little closer, my friend,

152
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:07,531
and you'll see that the
juice from the pickles

153
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:09,423
has leached over to
the grilled cheese,

154
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:11,480
rendering it sodden
and inedible.

155
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:14,192
I don't recall ordering
grilled cheese au jus.

156
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,563
Pickles have juice, dude.
It's like a main law of nature.

157
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:20,253
Ah, but that's where Lane knew how to
prevent this culinary catastrophe.

158
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:24,392
Prior to serving the dish, she would use
the french fries to build a tiny dam --

159
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:25,860
Dude, I get it.

160
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:27,530
It's all going to
the same place

161
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:30,151
inside that dark,
strange body of yours, Kirk.

162
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:31,451
Now eat it.

163
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:37,391
Lane's right.
You rock as a boss.

164
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:38,490
Yeah. How's she doing?

165
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,351
Dude, she is about
ready to burst.

166
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:41,251
Oh, yeah?

167
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,623
Yeah, she's like a giant piñata,
just waiting for some kid

168
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:46,231
to take a mallet to her stomach
and free the goodies inside.

169
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,282
I'm thinking a doctor might
be a better way to go.

170
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:49,760
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

171
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:51,493
Lane and I would like to
have you over for dinner.

172
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:53,523
Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
We should do that.

173
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,250
Great. So,
how's tomorrow, 8:30?

174
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:58,193
- Tomorrow? I don't know.
- Here's the thing --

175
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,502
Lane asked me to ask you about tomorrow
a long time ago, and I kind of forgot,

176
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,560
so she'd be mad if you
canceled last minute.

177
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:05,303
I'm not canceling --
I haven't accepted.

178
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:08,183
Let's not get into semantics.
It would be a bummer if you bailed.

179
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,182
'Cause she's been cooking
for like two days.

180
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:12,820
Okay, yeah, tomorrow night --
that sounds fine.

181
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:15,730
Great! And I hope you like curry,
'cause Lane's gone curry crazy.

182
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,282
I'm not big on curry.

183
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:19,682
Oh, well,
maybe you can pick around it.

184
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,942
See, it's the same program as the
one we used for that corporate stuff

185
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:27,522
but a different application.
It's personal. It's simple.

186
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:30,523
For you, maybe. I couldn't figure it out.
And your father was absolutely no help.

187
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:33,123
All we need to do is --
mom, you're doing it again.

188
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:34,420
I'm looking at the screen.

189
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:36,613
I know, but you're,
like, hovering.

190
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:39,483
I'm not hovering, Lorelai. "Hovering"
means you're elevated off the ground.

191
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,922
Do I look like I'm elevating?

192
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:43,160
- You seem awful tense, mom.
- Of course I'm tense.

193
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:46,390
Having your father around the house
all the time is extremely difficult.

194
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,630
He's just there, wandering about,
like a man of leisure.

195
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:52,000
Did he go through any of this stuff?
Did he at least sign the 1040?

196
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:53,310
I don't know.

197
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:56,133
Mom, he has to sign some of this
stuff before we can send it out.

198
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,823
He refuses to deal
with anything.

199
00:08:57,857 --> 00:09:00,370
All he does is watch golf,
pad around in his sweatsuit,

200
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,890
and annoy me with questions
about things he's misplaced.

201
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:05,230
He's getting to be a serious
pain in the you-know-what.

202
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,643
The nose? The ear?

203
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:08,960
Would it give you that much
pleasure to hear me say "ass"?

204
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:10,380
I wasn't sure,
but, yes, it did.

205
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,693
Emily!

206
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,310
Have you seen my --
Oh, hello, Lorelai.

207
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:17,260
Hi, dad. Nice threads.
Having lunch with Tony Soprano?

208
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:18,463
Don't encourage him.

209
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:19,580
You like it?

210
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:22,882
I realized that, since I was housebound,
I might as well wear whatever I like.

211
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,041
These are so comfy.

212
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:25,813
Have either of you
seen my putter?

213
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:28,321
No, but we have seen this 1040 tax form.
Sign it.

214
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:31,063
Did your mother tell you that I've
installed a putting green in the backyard?

215
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:31,773
It's great fun.

216
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,143
You are not going out to putt.
You'll catch your death.

217
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:36,030
And, Richard,
would you please sign this form?

218
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:38,012
Just leave the form.
I'll sign it later.

219
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,501
What are you doing down there?
The putter's not down there.

220
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:42,932
No, but your tax form's here.
Come on, dad. Sign it.

221
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,891
Fine, fine, fine,
fine, fine, fine.

222
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:48,513
And, yes! There it is.

223
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,091
Hallelujah, we
found the putter.

224
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:51,992
We have a few more things we
need to go over with you.

225
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:53,263
Later today, dear.

226
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:56,271
You always say that, but you never do.
And wear a hat!

227
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,632
Yes, mother.

228
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:01,102
Well, mom, he was watching golf.
Now he's playing golf.

229
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:02,401
That's progress.

230
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,390
- Hey, kid.
- I'm in.

231
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:05,500
You're robbing a bank?

232
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:07,681
The road trip --
I'm going with you to Mia's wedding.

233
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:09,962
Wow, that's great!
Are you sure?

234
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:12,382
Yes, I so need to get away.

235
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,742
I just had a huge
fight with Logan.

236
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:14,942
Oh, sweetie, why?

237
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:17,662
Because he's being a complete jerk.
He won't deal with anything.

238
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:19,451
And Mitchum just showed
up at the apartment.

239
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:20,982
- Mitchum came?
- I opened the door,

240
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:24,071
and there he was in a really
expensive coat and all this cologne.

241
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,350
And he yelled at Logan,
and Logan yelled back at him.

242
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:30,151
And, yes, Mitchum is a jerk, but I
agreed with him, and I told Logan that.

243
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:32,662
Wow, you agreed with the
boyfriend's dad? That's brave.

244
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:35,013
I couldn't help it, mom.
Logan is being immature.

245
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,722
And I can't focus on my work, and I
just really need to get out of here.

246
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:40,002
Honey, it sounds like a trip
like this is just what you need.

247
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:41,591
- A trip like what?
- Nothing, mom.

248
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:44,331
- Are you with grandma?
- Yes, it's our thursday computer lesson.

249
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:46,012
And it's no
"Tuesdays With Morrie."

250
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:47,382
Where are you
going on this trip?

251
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:49,162
Mia Halloway's wedding --
Charlotte, North Carolina.

252
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,440
- I have to be back by monday.
- That'll be no problem.

253
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,411
- This is gonna be a blast!
- Charlotte.

254
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,221
Mia wanted me to do a toast,
and I thought I could do a poem,

255
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,823
like you used to do for her when you
were a kid, so you have to help me.

256
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,792
Kiki Saltberry just came back
from a spa in Charlotte.

257
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:05,330
It's the Valentine resort, I think she
said, and she came back looking radiant.

258
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:06,822
What is grandma
saying about a spa?

259
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:10,123
We're staying at a Best Western, mom.
No spa facilities there.

260
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:13,343
So, okay, I'll pick you up at the crack
of dawn. We'll cram everything in the jeep.

261
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:15,052
No bathroom breaks
along the way, okay?

262
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:17,352
- Does grandma want to come?
- No. I mean, yes, but, no.

263
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,762
I'd have to rearrange my schedule,
but that can be done.

264
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,523
Mom, you really can't
leave dad all alone.

265
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,053
Alone, yes, completely alone,

266
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:25,222
with two maids, a cook,
and a nurse who comes daily.

267
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:27,273
Yes, grandma should come, too.
It'll be a hoot.

268
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:29,553
It would be fun, honey,
but grandma's real busy.

269
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,373
- Rory wants me to come?
- Well...

270
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:34,322
Well, she'll be graduating soon,
and I won't have many more opportunities

271
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:35,890
to spend time with her.

272
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:38,253
This is perfect.
I'm gonna start packing.

273
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:39,270
Oh, mom.

274
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:41,142
Oh, and we'll take my car.
I have no intention

275
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:44,043
of driving 800 miles
in an army vehicle.

276
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:45,870
Shotgun?

277
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:54,710
Mom, if you're gonna go this slowly,
you should really put your hazards on.

278
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:58,423
Excuse me, but after I almost
got that ridiculous DWI,

279
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,423
I can ill afford
a speeding ticket.

280
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:02,731
And a Jaguar is an invitation
to be pulled over.

281
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,500
Right, if you're speeding.
You're driving like you're in a parade.

282
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:06,570
Oh, hush.

283
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:09,411
Mom, seriously, by the time we get
there, the wedding will be over.

284
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:10,773
The guests will have gone home.

285
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:15,042
North Carolina will be under a sea
of water from melting ice caps.

286
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:17,043
- "See ya."
- Huh?

287
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:18,733
You could rhyme
"Mia" with "see ya."

288
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:20,760
Oh, that's good. Or "be ya."

289
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:21,453
Yeah.

290
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:23,222
You were such a peach,
dear Mia,

291
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:26,040
when Rory grew up,
she wanted to be ya.

292
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,202
Good. But do you think it
owes too much to yeats?

293
00:12:28,236 --> 00:12:30,180
Well, it needs some work,
but you try finding something

294
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:32,433
to rhyme with "Howard"
besides "coward."

295
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,833
Howard? She's marrying
a man named Howard?

296
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,200
What's wrong with Howard?

297
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:39,752
It's just, for me, it would be very
difficult if my husband was named Howard.

298
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:40,541
Why?

299
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,490
It's just not a noble name.

300
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,040
I like noble male names, strong --
John, Peter.

301
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:46,923
Richard.

302
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,280
Exactly. Richard
the lion-heart.

303
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:51,902
Well, I guess name nobility
wasn't high on Mia's list.

304
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,781
Howard the lion-heart.

305
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:56,232
What are you doing?

306
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:57,343
It's stuffy.

307
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:59,052
It's too cold to have
the window open.

308
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:01,170
Mom, just let me have it down --
oh, my god.

309
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:02,610
Lorelai, stop playing
with the window.

310
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:06,180
I'm not playing. I just want it down.
And you're making it go --

311
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:07,423
Are you kidding me?

312
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:11,102
Plea-- mother, I'm putting it --
I'm putting it --

313
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,683
Wha-- uh -- mom!

314
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:16,700
It's called a child lock,
appropriately enough.

315
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,983
So, Rory, what do you have
lined up postgraduation?

316
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:22,913
Oh, I'm setting up interviews
at different newspapers --

317
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:26,391
the Seattle Times, the Detroit Free
Press, San Francisco Chronicle.

318
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:29,563
Well, I'm not sure about the Seattle
paper, and the Chronicle is dreadful,

319
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:32,152
but the Detroit paper
is quite reputable.

320
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,343
You know what else a reputable paper is?
The New York Times,

321
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,250
the Boston Globe,
the Hartford Courant.

322
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,533
Yes, and only a short drive
away from Stars Hollow.

323
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,571
Oh, well, that never occurred to me,
but now that you mention it, yeah.

324
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:46,441
So, how does Logan feel about the
possibility of your moving far away?

325
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:47,672
I'm not sure.

326
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:49,073
You're not sure?

327
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,940
No. Things with Logan are...

328
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:53,111
Are what?

329
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:56,511
Uh, we're kind of going
through something.

330
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:57,941
Aw, that's a shame.

331
00:13:57,978 --> 00:13:59,342
Such a nice young man.

332
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:02,342
He was so thoughtful when your
grandfather was in the hospital.

333
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,380
Yeah.

334
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:05,801
Oh, hey, the skirf.

335
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:07,851
- Oh, the skirf.
- What's a skirf?

336
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:10,912
When Rory was really little, my first sewing
project was trying to make her a skirt.

337
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:12,373
- It was a desaster.
- It was terrible.

338
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:14,680
But Mia made me feel better by
putting it on Rory's head and saying

339
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:16,582
I created something new,
called a skirf.

340
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:17,702
Yeah.

341
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,831
So, do we all like show tunes?

342
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:23,320
I found this marvelous CD when
I took the car to be washed.

343
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:31,570
And I was put on bed rest so the babies
wouldn't come out before my due date.

344
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,420
And I look at the calendar, and I say
to Zach, "Zach, it's my due date."

345
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,421
And I'm like, "so?"

346
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,621
And I say,
"so now I want them to come out."

347
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:40,010
And I go, "duh,
let's get out of bed."

348
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:44,192
They can come out whenever they want,
as long as we've finished our meal...

349
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:48,142
...which, by the way,
was terrific, Lane.

350
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:49,480
- Thanks.
- Yeah, she had no problem

351
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:52,051
switching to a different meal when
I told her about your curry issues.

352
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:55,013
It's -- I just --
it's not really an issue.

353
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:59,103
Again, look, sorry about the wine.
I totally spaced.

354
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:02,803
I should have brought you something
sparkling, a fruity kind of a thing.

355
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:07,020
No, it's okay. Besides, they say one of
the things you can do to help induce labor

356
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,221
is have a glass of wine.

357
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:09,490
That or sex.

358
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:11,693
Well, I can only help
you with the wine.

359
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:15,301
So I should get going. I got to
get up early and open the diner.

360
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:18,333
Are you sure you don't wanna stay
for dessert? Homemade peach pie.

361
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,322
You made a peach pie?

362
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:22,061
Well, actually,
you made it at the diner,

363
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:24,850
which is technically your home,
but I paid for it, I swear.

364
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:26,801
- I'll have one quick piece.
- Yes!

365
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,660
This is really
nice of you guys.

366
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:29,841
What do you expect, man?

367
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:31,871
- You mean a lot to Lane and me.
- You do.

368
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:35,090
We feel really close to you,
and not just, you know, employees.

369
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,450
Yeah, uh, me too.

370
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:39,462
When it comes to extended family,
Zach and I don't have much.

371
00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:41,563
I've got my mom,
but she's not so much a family member

372
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:43,153
as she is a probation officer.

373
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:46,611
Yeah, and my old man ran off when
I was like 10. No note. No nothing.

374
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,740
So I got the feeling he
didn't want me to follow him.

375
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:53,773
So, you guys need
money or something?

376
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:59,661
Lane and I would like you to
be godfather to our twins.

377
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:03,291
Oh, really? Godfather?

378
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:07,361
We just want to make sure we have a
strong parental person for our boys.

379
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:08,362
Well...

380
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:10,620
- There's no paperwork involved.
- Right. I just --

381
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:13,842
- No notary public.
- No, I know. It's just...

382
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:21,663
Yeah, okay, sure.

383
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,011
Oh, man. That is so great.

384
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:25,160
Up high.

385
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:26,983
Come on.

386
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,452
All right. Okay. There you go.

387
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:34,482
No, are you listening? I've already
booked a swedish massage for 1:00.

388
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:37,112
I want to know what
I can do at 2:30.

389
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,910
Good lord, no. A watsu?

390
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,921
Why would I want to
re-experience my own birth?

391
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:43,342
I'll be back to
take your orders.

392
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,551
- Big menus.
- Yeah, that's a good sign.

393
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:47,412
Oh, I love when they show
pictures of the food.

394
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,562
I would be upset if I was
that fried chicken, though.

395
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:50,883
That picture makes
her look fat.

396
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:54,410
Fine. Book me a salt scrub at 2:30.
Thank you.

397
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:57,653
Where on earth are we?

398
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:00,370
Well, mom, since you wouldn't let
us take you to a drive-through,

399
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:04,423
we've come here to Winky's,
a fine eatery just off I-85.

400
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,761
- Very down home.
- We ready here?

401
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:10,520
Oh, uh, I'm only halfway through.
Don't tell me how it turns out.

402
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,631
I smell cigarette smoke.

403
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,962
This is one of those places that
still allows cigarettes, isn't it?

404
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:17,660
Mom, if you'd prefer to wait in the car,
we can bring food to you there.

405
00:17:17,697 --> 00:17:20,412
That would be foolish. The reason why
I refused to go to the drive-through

406
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:22,362
is because I won't
allow eating in my car.

407
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:24,882
- Hey, they have lobster.
- Lobster for $12.95.

408
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,412
How could you go wrong?
I'll have the lobster.

409
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:28,800
See, you'll have lobster. I'll have
shrimp. We'll make it a seafood night.

410
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:30,981
Seafood in a place like this --
very risky.

411
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:33,010
And a hot dog.
A hot dog for the table.

412
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:34,643
You'll go in on that with us,
won't you, mom?

413
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,500
I'll have a turkey sandwich on
wheat and a glass of Chardonnay.

414
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:38,881
That's the clear one.

415
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,781
My name is Charlene.
Holler if you need something.

416
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:43,973
Wow, huge case of
cakes behind you there.

417
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:46,473
Ooh, yeah.
Winky's got a trophy case full of cakes.

418
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:49,561
Hey, I bet Mia makes her triple-layered
german chocolate cake for her wedding,

419
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:50,851
- don't you think?
- Probably.

420
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:53,642
Mmm. Aromatherapy --
that's what I want.

421
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:56,551
Are you sure you two won't join
me for something at the spa --

422
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,953
facial, moroccan mud wrap?
My treat.

423
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:01,661
Mother, we came here because we made
a commitment to go to a wedding,

424
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:03,321
so that's what we're gonna do.

425
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:04,671
Suit yourself.

426
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:07,641
I need to use the facilities.
Wish me luck.

427
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:11,320
I love it here.
And I'm totally gonna score a panda

428
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,970
in that crane machine
on the way out.

429
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:16,082
Mom, do you think we should dial back
the talk about Mia in front of grandma?

430
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:19,381
I don't think she's thrilled to hear
about our surrogate mother/grandmother.

431
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,672
She knew that Mia is
the reason for the trip.

432
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,893
I think it's okay if
we talk about her.

433
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:26,851
I know, but it seems to bother her.
And I thought, during this trip,

434
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:29,542
we could do more mother/daughter,
daughter/daughter bonding.

435
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:31,632
10 hours in the car not
enough bonding for you?

436
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:34,642
I'm just worried about you guys.
What's gonna happen after I graduate?

437
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:37,223
After you graduate?
That's when the party gets started.

438
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:39,653
Yeah, I just --
I want you guys to remain close.

439
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,520
- Close?
- Ish.

440
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:44,942
Honey, your grandma and I have
a very complicated relationship,

441
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:47,463
but we'll be fine.
I don't want you to worry.

442
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:50,301
You go off and do your own thing.
I'm a grown-up.

443
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,363
A grown-up who wears a bib.
Thank you.

444
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:58,013
All righty. Looks like our choices
are "Hitch" or "The lake house."

445
00:18:58,048 --> 00:19:00,561
- I could use a laugh.
- All right, "The lake house" it is.

446
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,943
Oh, my dress got wrinkled.

447
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:03,612
Honey, just put it in
the shower with the steam

448
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:05,503
if mom ever finishes
shellacking her face.

449
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:08,493
I heard that, Lorelai.
I'm simply washing up.

450
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:12,101
Mom, the resort is 20 minutes away.
Why do you have to wash up here?

451
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:15,293
I can't very well arrive
at a luxurious resort

452
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:18,453
smelling of bad shellfish and
covered with the grime of the road.

453
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:20,850
"The road." Who are you --
Willie Nelson?

454
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:22,632
Hello.

455
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,890
Mia, how is the
blushing bride-to-be?

456
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:28,373
Surprisingly calm,
but I've had two glasses of wine,

457
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,921
So we'll see tomorrow
when the buzz wears off.

458
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,713
- Oh, you'll do great.
- Hi, Mia.

459
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:35,972
Oh, hi, Rory. I just wanted to
see if you got here all right.

460
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:38,032
How's the motel?
Not too terrible, I hope.

461
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:40,561
Oh, no, it's great.
We have two beds, sanitized cups,

462
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:43,900
Keanu Reeves in his most touching
role to date. What could be better?

463
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:45,771
Oh, grandma, hold on.

464
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:47,361
Oh, Emily's with you?

465
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:51,443
Oh, um, yeah, we picked her up
hitchhiking on her way to a rock festival.

466
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,021
She's going to the
Valentine resort.

467
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:55,571
Well, if Emily's here,
then she has to come to the wedding.

468
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:59,301
No, that's okay. She's spending tomorrow
getting rubbed, wrapped, and scrubbed.

469
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:01,102
Oh, no,
she's asking me to the wedding?

470
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:02,130
No, no. It's okay.

471
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,940
So the ceremony's at noon.
We'll be there around 11:30.

472
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:08,191
Oh, please ask Emily to come.
We have plenty of food.

473
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:10,593
Howard and I would be
thrilled to have her join us.

474
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:12,232
In fact, I insist.

475
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:16,270
That is so thoughtful of you, Mia,
and I am sure she would love to come.

476
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:18,093
- Great. Now I have to go.
- No, you don't.

477
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,833
It would be rude not to. Damn!

478
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:22,053
She says she's delighted and
flattered that you asked.

479
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:23,751
Oh, that's wonderful.

480
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:26,571
I look forward to seeing
all three of you tomorrow.

481
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:28,172
- Sleep well.
- You, too, Mia.

482
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,223
- Bye.
- Bye.

483
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,360
Well, I hope the resort will
let me change my times.

484
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:34,413
I'll pick the two of you up at
11:00 sharp tomorrow. Be out front.

485
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:37,041
Of course, I didn't bring a
thing to wear to a wedding.

486
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:40,043
Luckily, they're going bohemian,
so it won't really matter.

487
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:44,833
We're bonding.

488
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:46,743
Oh, this could be a good thing.

489
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,872
No, the only good thing is that
mom is gonna get to the resort

490
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:53,083
still smelling like bad lobster,
'cause I left my doggie bag in her car.

491
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:13,343
Hey. Everything okay?

492
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,380
Great. Everything's --
Yeah. Great.

493
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:18,613
You know I don't open
for another hour.

494
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:21,030
Oh, no, I know, but last night when
you said you had to get up early,

495
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:23,820
I realized it's time, maybe,
I come and help crank up the place.

496
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:24,830
Okay.

497
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:33,210
I actually love this time of day,
you know, real quiet.

498
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:38,332
You know what's, like, amazing?

499
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,801
How peaceful Stars Hollow
is at this time of day.

500
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:42,983
It's, like, spooky peaceful.

501
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:44,523
You ever notice that?

502
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:48,922
I'm sorry. I really don't enjoy
talking this early in the morning.

503
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:51,312
Oh, hey, copy that.
I'm right there with you.

504
00:21:56,678 --> 00:21:59,351
Now, Lane --
she loves to talk in the morning.

505
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:02,413
Lots of morning chin music
with that one. Not me.

506
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:06,192
I take not talking
over talking any day.

507
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:08,993
- Ooh, awesome catch.
- Thanks.

508
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,141
- Pretty obvious you played some ball.
- A little.

509
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,453
I didn't really get
into sports much.

510
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:20,983
My dad didn't do sports with me when I
was little, and then he, you know, split.

511
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:23,531
Yeah, you said. That's too bad.

512
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:24,610
Yeah.

513
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:28,180
- What kind of music you into?
- I don't really listen to much music.

514
00:22:28,335 --> 00:22:32,330
If I'm driving around in my truck, I'll,
you know, maybe put on an oldies station.

515
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:33,423
I like some motown.

516
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:36,091
Oh dude, I know the perfect band for
you. You would so get off on them.

517
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:39,163
They're young, but their sound is way
borrowed from those old guys from the '70s.

518
00:22:39,196 --> 00:22:41,191
Listen, I got to
fire up the stoves.

519
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:43,320
Yeah, go, go. Fire 'em up.

520
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:46,623
You know, I can't pay you any
extra 'cause you came in early.

521
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,101
Oh, yeah, I know.
I just figure it's part of my job,

522
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,902
and it's a chance
for us to hang out.

523
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:55,320
Plus, you know... the quiet.

524
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:57,161
Right.

525
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,440
Lorelai, you didn't even knock.

526
00:23:03,478 --> 00:23:05,230
Well, that's okay.
Mia leaves the door open.

527
00:23:05,255 --> 00:23:06,690
She likes people to
just come on in.

528
00:23:06,726 --> 00:23:08,641
She's probably too busy to
greet everybody, grandma.

529
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:11,522
Well, of course she is. She should
have someone greet people for her.

530
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,352
Oh, look at all
these great pictures.

531
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:15,100
Not everyone has a maid,
you know, mom.

532
00:23:15,135 --> 00:23:17,491
How hard is it to hire
a maid for the day?

533
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:20,020
Well, last I checked, they didn't
have them at bed bath & beyond.

534
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:22,391
Oh, this must be Howard.
Look. Here we are.

535
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:25,802
So cute. That's the rug where you used
to spin around at the Independence Inn.

536
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,433
I bet you threw up just seconds
after that picture was taken.

537
00:23:28,495 --> 00:23:31,741
Are we going in, or are we going to
watch the ceremony from the entryway?

538
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:33,720
- Oh, you're here!
- Hi!

539
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:36,110
- Hi!
- Hi!

540
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:38,773
Did you find it all right?

541
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:41,602
Yeah, mom's got the GPS. Apparently,
it's great if you know how to use it.

542
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:43,703
Yeah, we saw a lot of your
neighborhood -- very nice.

543
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:46,292
Oh, those damn GPS
drive me crazy.

544
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,732
Whatever happened to asking
the guy at the gas station?

545
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:49,982
Good question.

546
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,530
Hello, Mia. Thank you so much for
inviting me to this special occasion.

547
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,442
Emily, I'm so glad
you could be here.

548
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,602
Well, let's go in.
Let's not just stand here.

549
00:23:57,635 --> 00:24:00,622
I know a wedding wasn't what you
had in mind when you came down here.

550
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:03,833
What I had in mind was spending time with
my daughter and granddaughter, wherever.

551
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:06,191
- Will you sign my guest book, please?
- Oh, certainly.

552
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:10,062
I just feel so lucky to have all
the Gilmore ladies under one roof.

553
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:12,313
Speaking of roofs,
you have a charming home.

554
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:13,160
Oh, thank you.

555
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm always amazed at what good
taste can do with a small space.

556
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:17,773
Oh, it is beautiful.

557
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,710
Yeah, so many personal
touches everywhere.

558
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:21,742
Thank you. I agree with Emily.
It's a small house,

559
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:25,083
And it's made even smaller by Howard's
junk. But you know what they say --

560
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:27,172
you marry a man,
you marry his junk. Howard.

561
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,953
- Mia --
- Howard, Howard.

562
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:31,571
This is Emily Gilmore,
the mother and grandmother

563
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,751
of the famous Lorelai and Rory.

564
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:34,782
Hi.

565
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:36,550
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

566
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,493
I thought you weren't supposed
to see the bride in her gown

567
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:39,643
before you got married.

568
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:43,851
Yeah, and if the bride sees a lizard
crossing the road, that's bad news, too.

569
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,663
Oh, well, haven't seen a lizard,
but too late for the dress,

570
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:48,240
- 'cause Howard zipped me up.
- Oh no.

571
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:49,902
Where's the zip-up on
the bad-luck-o-meter?

572
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:52,310
Not sure, but I'd throw some salt
over your shoulders. Just in case.

573
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:53,841
I don't have any salt.
I might have some splenda.

574
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:57,042
You are exactly as Mia described you --
you both are.

575
00:24:57,077 --> 00:24:59,603
And believe me,
she described you a lot.

576
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:01,293
Well, I hope she left
out the bad stuff.

577
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:02,672
There's no bad stuff.

578
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:03,821
Lucky you.

579
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,392
The sooner we get married,
the sooner we eat cake.

580
00:25:08,426 --> 00:25:09,833
Oh, honey, you're so romantic.

581
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:12,911
Emily, could I just borrow the girls
for a quick touch-up in the powder room?

582
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:14,863
- They're all yours.
- Oh, thanks.

583
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:17,023
Okay, guys,
let's get me beautiful.

584
00:25:17,386 --> 00:25:18,913
Oh, thank you.

585
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,780
Mia adores them.

586
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:24,702
Yes, I know.

587
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:31,021
Well, come in. Find a seat.

588
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:34,263
The sofa will be fine.

589
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:38,451
And so, a toast to you,
dear Mia.

590
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:41,822
It makes us all so
glad to see ya...

591
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:45,680
blissfully joined with dear,
good Howard.

592
00:25:45,715 --> 00:25:50,321
May your love last long,
like it's battery-powered.

593
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:54,833
Rory and I wanted to do a poem for you,
because when Rory was little,

594
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:57,140
she used to love
making up poems,

595
00:25:57,176 --> 00:26:00,971
and we would perform them for you,
and that was such a fun time.

596
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:06,871
Uh, so, what I've realized
now is that you can get away

597
00:26:06,908 --> 00:26:09,951
with a lot of bad rhymes
when you're cute and 5.

598
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,012
But we do want to say...

599
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:14,871
Excuse-me, would you mind terribly
getting me a glass of water?

600
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,100
...the best things in life are worth waiting
for, even if they take a long time...

601
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:19,810
She keeps her house very dry.

602
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:21,292
So, let's...

603
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:24,222
A toast to you.

604
00:26:24,257 --> 00:26:26,282
We love you so much. Cheers.

605
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,332
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

606
00:26:28,368 --> 00:26:29,861
Congratulations.

607
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:32,103
Thank you.

608
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:34,242
That was wonderful.

609
00:26:34,977 --> 00:26:36,133
Are you Rory?

610
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:37,723
There's someone
here to see you.

611
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:39,333
...that you are here today.

612
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:42,871
And thank you for those of
you who came from so far away.

613
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:45,580
Thank you again for the toast.

614
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:48,152
I'll thank my sister for
all the wonderful help...

615
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:49,281
Hey.

616
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:50,512
What the hell are
you doing here?

617
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:53,002
I'm sorry. I don't mean to crash this.
I just need to talk to you.

618
00:26:53,036 --> 00:26:54,951
- How did you know where I was?
- I called Paris.

619
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:57,382
She found the invitation. I kept trying
your cell, but you didn't pick up.

620
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,412
Well, that's the
advantage of caller I.D.

621
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:01,672
- I get it. You're still mad.
- No kidding.

622
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:04,723
I'm here, so you have to talk to me --
the advantage of showing up in person.

623
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:08,162
Wow, I can't believe you're still doing
this. This is so last year's Logan.

624
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:08,792
What?

625
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:11,382
You think you can just fly
anywhere I am and overwhelm me

626
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:13,112
by just showing up and --

627
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:15,413
I'm just not impressed anymore
by your grand gestures.

628
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:18,111
I'm not trying to impress you. I just
want to tell you what I've been thinking.

629
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:20,230
- I don't care --
- And I wanted to see you.

630
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:22,441
I'm in the middle of a wedding
celebration of a close friend.

631
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:24,822
I don't have time to stand
here and listen to you explain

632
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:26,381
your stupid immature behavior.

633
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:27,692
If you would just
hear me out --

634
00:27:27,706 --> 00:27:30,030
No, you go blow
off steam in Vegas,

635
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,121
you gamble away thousands of dollars,
you drink all night,

636
00:27:32,156 --> 00:27:35,323
and do god knows what else.
This is me blowing off steam.

637
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:38,753
I'm sorry to interrupt, Rory,
but Mia wanted me to tell you

638
00:27:38,788 --> 00:27:40,290
- we're about to cut the cake.
- Okay.

639
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,540
- Will your friend join us?
- Um, no, he can't stay.

640
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,461
Yeah, I was just stopping by.
Thanks, anyway.

641
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,872
Oh, okay.

642
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,431
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, there.

643
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,683
Talk to me, Zach.
What do you got?

644
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:57,791
Okay, bowl of chili, two dogs,
one BLT, shepherd's pie,

645
00:27:57,825 --> 00:27:59,150
and a mushroom soup.

646
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:02,080
And those guys in the corner were asking
me if I had a pack of lucky strikes

647
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:03,612
or a burger to spare.
What's that about?

648
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:06,432
Bowling humor -- strikes, spares.
Never gets old, guys.

649
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:08,503
Oh, I totally missed it.

650
00:28:08,577 --> 00:28:09,980
- Oh, man!
- What's wrong?

651
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:13,182
Last night, I made this mix of tunes
that I thought would be right up your alley.

652
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:13,990
Okay.

653
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,700
Well, you know, new stuff that
sounds kind of classic rock-y --

654
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:18,783
my morning jacket,
who are like Neil Young reborn,

655
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:20,741
if Neil would have,
you know, died.

656
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:23,351
Wolfmother -- definitely
channeling Zeppelin -- modern,

657
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:25,830
but not so much that it would
freak out somebody of your taste.

658
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:26,860
- The point?
- The point is,

659
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:29,071
- I totally forgot to bring it.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

660
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:31,332
- Yeah, but I spent all night on it.
- That's nice.

661
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:33,481
Gave me something to do
instead of sitting around,

662
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:35,152
waiting for Lane to
pop out the babies.

663
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:36,063
It'll happen.

664
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:37,842
Yeah, don't I know it?

665
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:40,340
Denver omelet, steak sandwich.

666
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:42,521
Two cheeseburgers --
medium and well.

667
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:45,480
- Question -- circumcision, yes or no?
- Pardon?

668
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:47,290
We have to make a decision as
soon as the boys are born,

669
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,051
and I'm really on
the fence about it.

670
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,770
I thought about having Mrs.
Kim weigh in, but her opinion would be

671
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:55,170
kind of hypothetical 'cause she doesn't
have the goods, as far as I know.

672
00:28:55,306 --> 00:28:58,400
Right, so, you being a guy, I figured
I could use your input on this.

673
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:01,631
You know, something like this -- it's
kind of personal between you and Lane,

674
00:29:01,668 --> 00:29:05,163
- so go with your gut.
- Yeah, okay. Cool.

675
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:06,742
Bill, refill?

676
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:10,053
Let's say your kid falls out of a
tree and majorly gashes his head.

677
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:12,722
Do you run to him right away or
just let him kind of shake it off?

678
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:14,421
I don't want to be a wussy dad,
but --

679
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:17,682
Probably not the right time to be talking
about gashed heads and circumcisions.

680
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:20,783
Right. Right.
I totally get that.

681
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,891
Maybe we could, uh, go over to
Casey's after work and grab a beer

682
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:26,401
- and talk about some stuff.
- Look, I-I can't be --

683
00:29:26,438 --> 00:29:28,553
- Please.
- Okay.

684
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:32,563
Listen, I know what's
going on, okay?

685
00:29:32,595 --> 00:29:34,391
You're about to become a father,
so you're panicking.

686
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:35,672
I am, dude, big-time.

687
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:37,071
Promise you you'll
get through this.

688
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,552
I don't know how to
throw a damn frisbee.

689
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:39,912
Don't worry about it, okay?

690
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:42,631
I really could use your help
on all this father stuff

691
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,403
- that I know nothing about.
- Zach --

692
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:47,591
What the hell are they supposed to
call me -- "dad," "pop," "papa"?

693
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,141
- Do I look like a papa to you?
- It'll come to you eventually.

694
00:29:50,175 --> 00:29:53,150
Papa is a big, cuddly guy from
Italy with all this dark hair.

695
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:54,242
That's so not me.

696
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:56,752
Listen, the first time
April turned up in my life,

697
00:29:56,785 --> 00:30:00,412
I didn't know squat about being a
father, but eventually, it came to me.

698
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:03,092
I found my dad mode,
and you will, too.

699
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:05,381
- Dude, I hope so.
- Yeah. Don't sweat it.

700
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:09,513
Go ahead and deliver these to the clowns
in the corner over there. You will be fine.

701
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:13,112
I -- Okay, all right.

702
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:15,503
- Guy's a real goofball, huh?
- Yeah, watch it, Bill.

703
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:17,722
- I'm not finished with that pie.
- Yeah, you are.

704
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:21,751
And I drove through
Connecticut once -- beautiful.

705
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:24,952
In fact, Cathy and I considered moving
to New England 'cause we love the foliage.

706
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:27,420
Well, we got a lot of that.
It practically grows on trees.

707
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:30,211
But the cold -- no thank you.
I can barely handle it here in Charlotte

708
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,801
when it drops below 40.

709
00:30:31,837 --> 00:30:33,842
Cathy says it's a
circulation thing.

710
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:36,381
I think it's a matter of not having
the fat layer that you women do.

711
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,750
You should be glad
you don't have it.

712
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:40,001
If you did, you couldn't wear
such an amazing sweater.

713
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:43,431
Hey, Mia put out some of her famous
mini cream puffs. They're delicious.

714
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:45,860
Uh-oh, may have to get
me one of those. Scusie.

715
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:48,411
- God bless you.
- No problem.

716
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:49,942
- You looked a little trapped there.
- No, no.

717
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:52,423
I was riveted by stories
of foliage and fat.

718
00:30:52,455 --> 00:30:54,772
- Where'd you go off to?
- Logan showed up.

719
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:56,251
- What?!
- Yeah.

720
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:58,912
- Where is he?
- Outside, leaning against a car.

721
00:30:58,948 --> 00:31:00,483
Why? You wouldn't
let him come in?

722
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:01,110
No.

723
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:02,692
Really? Look at you,
all tough love.

724
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:05,912
I'm still mad at him. I'm not gonna melt
just because he flies here to see me.

725
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:08,243
If we're gonna do this,
it's gonna be on my terms.

726
00:31:08,275 --> 00:31:09,220
Wow.

727
00:31:09,256 --> 00:31:11,762
It doesn't look like grandma's
having a good time, is she?

728
00:31:11,796 --> 00:31:14,482
No, grandma's staging a sit-in,
as only grandma could do,

729
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:17,040
in the middle of a hoopla.
Some people would call it a shindig.

730
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:18,113
I'm here to tell
you it's a hoopla.

731
00:31:18,148 --> 00:31:19,871
I have so much to
learn from you still.

732
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:24,670
Ladies, I'm striking out left and right
in my attempts to coax someone to dance.

733
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:26,870
Would either of you
salvage my pride?

734
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:28,063
Howard, I'll dance with you.

735
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,070
Thank you.

736
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:30,333
Talk to grandma.

737
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:36,860
Hi, mom. How are you doing?

738
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,211
Oh, fine. I'm just going through
my schedule for the week.

739
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:40,780
So, did Howard
ask you to dance?

740
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,700
He did, yes -- very thoughtful.

741
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,132
Why didn't you dance with him?

742
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,282
I don't feel like
dancing right now.

743
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:49,702
Besides, I have no idea how
one dances to cowboy music.

744
00:31:49,738 --> 00:31:52,541
You want to dance with me? We could
slap our knees, shout "yee-haw."

745
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:54,901
No thank you. I think I'll just
wait for the appropriate moment

746
00:31:54,937 --> 00:31:56,481
to excuse myself gracefully.

747
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,893
Mom, I told you I didn't think
you were gonna want to come.

748
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:02,392
So, Lorelai, gal,
we have got to do some catching up.

749
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:03,662
How have you been, sweetie?

750
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:04,960
Good, Donna. Good.

751
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:08,050
Mia says you have you own inn.
That is so far out.

752
00:32:08,088 --> 00:32:10,642
It is great.
Um, mom, this is Donna.

753
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:12,783
This is my mother,
Emily Gilmore.

754
00:32:12,818 --> 00:32:14,783
- How do you do?
- Really well, thank you.

755
00:32:14,815 --> 00:32:17,152
Donna and I were maids together
at the Independence Inn.

756
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,793
A few hundred lives ago, huh?

757
00:32:18,828 --> 00:32:21,111
Hey, listen,
your toast was so great.

758
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,023
Thanks. I didn't know I
was gonna be the only one.

759
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:24,440
Oh, but you were
the perfect choice.

760
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,203
I mean, for god's sake,
Mia was like a mother to you.

761
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:29,423
Um, so, how are you?
You look good.

762
00:32:29,457 --> 00:32:30,750
- I do, don't I?
- Yeah.

763
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:33,583
I tell you, six years ago, when I
first started the raw-foods thing --

764
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:35,700
Do you know if they
put the coffee out yet?

765
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:37,340
- Mother.
- What?

766
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,381
I'm sorry, but you're talking about
something between the two of you,

767
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,322
and I could really
use a cup of coffee.

768
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:44,973
You know what? I am having a
serious craving for herbal tea.

769
00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:46,860
Let's get something
together, Emily.

770
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:48,283
All right.

771
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:01,470
- Hey.
- Hey.

772
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:03,902
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. It's fine.

773
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:06,623
I just always seem to forget my
mother doesn't play well with others.

774
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:09,142
Oh, I think she's doing
all right, considering.

775
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:10,163
Considering...

776
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:13,823
I mean, in terms of you and
me and Rory and our history.

777
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:15,462
Yeah, so? We have a history.

778
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:18,422
Seeing me with both of you must
bring back very painful memories.

779
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,620
Imagine how difficult it must have
been for your mother to lose you.

780
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:24,740
She didn't lose me.
I embarrassed her, so I had to leave.

781
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:26,703
But Lorelai,
even in the best of circumstances,

782
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:29,352
you never want to think that your
child doesn't need you anymore.

783
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:31,542
She just wanted me out of the
house so she didn't have to explain

784
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:33,761
why my school uniform
didn't fit anymore.

785
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:36,710
That's not the impression I
got when she came to see me.

786
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:40,023
What? When did she
come to see you?

787
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:41,891
Oh, must have been five years ago,
when I came back

788
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:44,062
for that visit to Stars Hollow.

789
00:33:44,095 --> 00:33:45,653
She came and found
me at the inn.

790
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:47,521
- Why?
- I think she wanted to meet me.

791
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:49,841
And she asked me to send
her photos of you and Rory

792
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:51,973
from those years when
you were staying with me.

793
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:53,130
She never told you?

794
00:33:53,168 --> 00:33:55,081
No, she definitely
never told me.

795
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,552
Well, my dear,
my dancing feet are all warmed up.

796
00:33:57,585 --> 00:33:59,771
- Your turn.
- Oh, goody, the dance.

797
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:02,542
Now we find out if we're
really meant to be together.

798
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:15,130
You didn't have
to bring me cake.

799
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,432
I didn't.

800
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:22,233
You wanted to talk, so talk.

801
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:26,732
All I wanted to do
was say I'm sorry,

802
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:31,293
so... I'm sorry. You were right.
I was being immature.

803
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:32,431
Okay.

804
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:35,831
When the whole
deal fell apart...

805
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:41,042
I knew I was in so much trouble,
I just -- I totally lost it.

806
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:43,810
I couldn't face anything.

807
00:34:44,078 --> 00:34:48,141
I had so much invested in it in every
way that, when it all collapsed,

808
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:51,790
it was like I fell into this hole
I couldn't pull myself out of.

809
00:34:52,856 --> 00:34:56,081
And I also realized that my dad was right.
He had every reason to be pissed at me.

810
00:34:56,115 --> 00:34:58,710
I mean,
I would have fired me for what I did.

811
00:35:00,487 --> 00:35:05,393
So, I decided the only way to fix this
is to not be my dad's employee anymore.

812
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:06,450
What?

813
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:08,590
I went to him, and I just --
I said --

814
00:35:08,627 --> 00:35:12,872
I was calm, apologetic,
no shouting, no threats.

815
00:35:12,906 --> 00:35:16,033
I just said I didn't want to be a pawn
in whatever game he had in mind for me.

816
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:16,902
Really?

817
00:35:16,935 --> 00:35:19,703
I am officially not working for
the Huntzberger Group anymore.

818
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:20,660
Oh, my god.

819
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:23,253
Yeah, and it feels really good.

820
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,570
I mean, it felt great finally
standing up to my dad.

821
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:27,981
How did he take it?

822
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:30,192
He tried to put up this cool,
detached front,

823
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:33,100
but I think I actually saw
steam coming out of his ears.

824
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,702
Basically, he told
me to hit the road.

825
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:37,280
And you took him literally.

826
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:39,622
I just needed to see you.

827
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:45,650
The thing is,
even though he was mad, I swear I saw

828
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:50,802
the slightest glimmer of pride
in his eyes, just for a second.

829
00:35:50,837 --> 00:35:54,133
I mean,
no one walks out on Mitchum Huntzberger.

830
00:35:55,407 --> 00:35:56,933
I'm proud of you, too.

831
00:35:58,085 --> 00:36:00,880
I almost wish I'd saved
you a bite of cake.

832
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:08,310
Boyfriend?

833
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:10,230
Yes.

834
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,573
He came with you?

835
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:13,962
No, I guess he flew
down to see Rory.

836
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:16,981
It's hard for me to think of
little Rory with a boyfriend.

837
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:19,350
- She's not so little anymore.
- No.

838
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:21,891
I just hope she doesn't
get her heart broken.

839
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:25,482
I can assure you, if anyone does
any heartbreaking, it will be Rory.

840
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:27,373
- Probably.
- Definitely.

841
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:31,133
She's such a smart, confident young
woman. She's really amazing --

842
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:32,423
witty, charming,

843
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:36,182
valedictorian in high school,
editor of the college paper.

844
00:36:36,215 --> 00:36:39,492
Sounds like she'll have her pick of jobs
at newspapers all over the country.

845
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,373
Rory will be fine.

846
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:43,393
Well, you would know.

847
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,921
Hey.

848
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:46,233
Here you go.

849
00:36:46,457 --> 00:36:49,122
Well, we should probably get going,
let Mia and Howard do

850
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:51,042
whatever it is they're gonna
do the rest of the night.

851
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:53,033
- Lorelai.
- What? That could mean anything.

852
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:55,393
Well, she's right.
The bride and groom have wild plans

853
00:36:55,428 --> 00:36:57,901
to take off all their clothes,
jump into their pajamas,

854
00:36:57,937 --> 00:36:59,813
and listen to "A
prairie home companion."

855
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:01,260
See? Dirty mind -- you.

856
00:37:01,298 --> 00:37:04,090
I can't tell you how much it meant
for me to have you here. Thank you.

857
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:06,630
Oh, you kidding?
I wouldn't have missed it.

858
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:09,470
Mia, best wishes to you.
It was a lovely wedding.

859
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:10,581
Thank you...

860
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:11,923
For everything.

861
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,620
It was my pleasure.

862
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,090
Bill is asking for
seconds on his pie --

863
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,713
something about how you
owe him from earlier.

864
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:25,022
Sure, give it to him.

865
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:27,742
Look, man, I'm really sorry
about the way I've been acting --

866
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:29,821
leaning on you for
all this father stuff.

867
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:31,043
Don't worry about it.

868
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:33,793
No, I was just all bent out of shape
about being a perfect father --

869
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:35,982
like there is such a thing.
And I was so freaking nervous,

870
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:38,080
I'm like, "hey,
maybe Luke can take up the slack."

871
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:39,741
Hey, if I can help out, I will.

872
00:37:39,776 --> 00:37:42,150
No, but I dig what you
said about the dad mode --

873
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:44,470
makes perfect sense.
I'm really psyched to feel it kick in.

874
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:45,843
- Okay, good.
- Totally.

875
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,560
Oh, I almost forgot.
This is the CD.

876
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:49,793
Oh, great.

877
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:52,860
Yeah, I listed the band names on the
back. You don't have to listen to it.

878
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:54,203
No, I want to hear it.

879
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:55,901
Luke's diner.

880
00:37:55,935 --> 00:37:58,181
Who knows,
maybe I'll really get into Wolfmother.

881
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:00,361
Okay, okay. Do not move.

882
00:38:00,396 --> 00:38:02,293
I'll be right there.
Don't move.

883
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:05,571
I have to go.
Lane's water broke.

884
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:08,423
I need my... coat.

885
00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:10,431
I-I don't --
I don't need my coat.

886
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:11,753
My keys are in my coat.

887
00:38:11,786 --> 00:38:13,780
That's it. We're closed, folks.
I'm driving.

888
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:16,383
- No, no, no, man. I can do this.
- Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach.

889
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:19,371
Dad mode doesn't have to
kick in right now. Let's go.

890
00:38:19,408 --> 00:38:21,321
Last one out, lock the door,
turn off the lights.

891
00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:22,053
What about my --

892
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:23,791
Just take the whole
damn pie, Bill.

893
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,952
So, he's really not
working for his dad?

894
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:29,861
No, he's out of there.

895
00:38:29,878 --> 00:38:31,600
Well, it's probably
the best thing for him.

896
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:33,712
How did he feel about you
sending him back to New York?

897
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:37,281
Um, I think he was okay with it. I told
him it was an all-girls road trip.

898
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,452
Exactly. No boys allowed,
except for that male stripper we hired.

899
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,560
Well, good night.

900
00:38:41,598 --> 00:38:42,982
Oh, grandma,
aren't you coming in?

901
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:44,650
No, I just wanted to
walk you to your room,

902
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:47,043
seeing as this isn't the
safest of neighborhoods.

903
00:38:47,078 --> 00:38:49,671
Mom, now I feel like I should
walk you back to the car

904
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:52,623
and then you're gonna walk me back and
then we'll be stuck in a terrible loop

905
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:54,350
and neither of us is
wearing the shoes for that.

906
00:38:54,385 --> 00:38:55,573
Oh, grandma, you should stay.

907
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:58,461
We're gonna get junk food from the
vending machine, and watch a movie.

908
00:38:58,496 --> 00:39:00,002
Come on. Don't you like dots?

909
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:01,222
Hey, get some Little Debbie.

910
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,163
Seriously, Rory, I can't stay.

911
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:05,582
Too late, grandma.
I'm already getting you a little debbie.

912
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:12,992
Oh, I bought her a suit.

913
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,233
Did you?

914
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:16,162
Yeah. It was so fun.

915
00:39:16,198 --> 00:39:18,850
It was weird, you know,
but we found something really great,

916
00:39:18,886 --> 00:39:21,531
and it just felt like
a rite of passage.

917
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:22,880
I'm sure.

918
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:28,070
Made me imagine, you know,
what it's gonna be like

919
00:39:28,848 --> 00:39:30,432
after she leaves.

920
00:39:31,307 --> 00:39:32,310
Of course.

921
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:36,262
It's gonna be hard
to be without her.

922
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:41,382
Well, I'm sure you'll
get through it.

923
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,030
What I mean to say is, mom,
I know that it was hard for you.

924
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:54,833
Have you seen "The
pursuit of happyness"?

925
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:58,573
Is that the one
with Will Smith?

926
00:39:58,606 --> 00:39:59,742
He's so attractive.

927
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:01,670
Mmm! Mom has a thing
for Will Smith.

928
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:03,720
I don't have a thing for him.
Is it on now?

929
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:04,603
Yeah.

930
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:09,491
Oh, my god!
Lane had her babies.

931
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,881
Zach just sent me
a photo. Here.

932
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:15,592
- Oh, cute!
- Aren't they cute?

933
00:40:15,628 --> 00:40:18,101
I'm sure that little camera
distorts their faces.

934
00:40:18,136 --> 00:40:19,973
What do you mean, mom?
They're cute.

935
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:21,060
Here's another one.

936
00:40:21,097 --> 00:40:23,373
Oh, sweet.

937
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:25,000
Why did they
misspell "happyness"?

938
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:26,371
we'll find out.

939
00:40:29,245 --> 00:40:30,781
There's your boyfriend, mom.

940
00:40:30,826 --> 00:40:32,040
- Who?
- He's not my boyfriend.

941
00:40:32,078 --> 00:40:34,012
- Will Smith. Mom has a thing for him.
- You like Will Smith?

942
00:40:34,046 --> 00:40:36,612
- I think that he's very charming.
- That's all right.
