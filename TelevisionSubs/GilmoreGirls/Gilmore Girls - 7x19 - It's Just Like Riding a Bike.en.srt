1
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:31,693
Hey

2
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:34,310
Well, well, well I always
suspected this day would come.

3
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:34,835
Hi Kirk.

4
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:36,052
You're not getting this seat back.

5
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:36,560
Huh?

6
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,231
You can't, it's mine now and frankly

7
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:39,954
I can see why you hogged it for so long.

8
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:40,538
What?

9
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,209
It's clearly the best stool in the joint.

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,600
Close to the cash register and the kitchen,

11
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:46,458
which guarantees plenty
of face time with the boss.

12
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,340
Climate wise it's positioned
between two air-conditioning vents

13
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,290
which creates a nice cross ventilation�

14
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,056
- Hey Kirk�
- �never.

15
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:53,986
You can have the seat. Hey

16
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,278
Hey.

17
00:00:57,495 --> 00:00:58,894
- Coffee?
- Yes please.

18
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,749
All right, ah to stay or to go?

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,775
-  Um� To stay.
- Good, okay.

20
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:08,140
- Lorelai.
- Hi ya doll.

21
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:08,745
Hey.

22
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,865
It's so nice seeing you back in here.

23
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:12,970
- Thanks.
- Been a long time.

24
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:13,980
What 9, 10 months.

25
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:14,763
Something like that.

26
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:15,950
Actually I can tell you exactly when

27
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,439
Lorelai was in her last
'cause I marked it in my calendar.

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,652
"May 22, 2006, stool
available?" it's important to�

29
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:24,126
Enough Kirk, here you go.

30
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:29,052
-Thank you.
- So how's it going?

31
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:31,297
Oh really well. They inn is really busy.

32
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:32,298
Yeah I'll bet.

33
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,590
And so how are you doing.

34
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:37,024
Me? Good, really good.

35
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,314
- Good.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:44,685
Um, it sure is warm outside.

37
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,733
Yeah you know when
I opened the diner this morning

38
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:50,280
I remember thinking how warm it was.

39
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,849
- Really!
- Yeah.

40
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,078
You know what maybe I should take this to go.

41
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,079
To get back to work and.

42
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,871
Yeah okay let me just get you a cup.

43
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:00,261
It's been really busy at the Inn.

44
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:02,248
Yeah. Yeah you said. There you go.

45
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:03,045
Lid on there.

46
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:04,447
Oh great.

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,324
-Nah, I got it.
-Thanks.

48
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:10,332
Okay so I'll see you around.

49
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,955
Definitely, I'll see you around. Okay.

50
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,724
-Bye.
- Bye.

51
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,447
Subtitle by Maglori

52
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:24,372
- Hi.
- Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

53
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:25,560
You called me.

54
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,930
Oh, no, not you.
I was talking to Davey. Hey.

55
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:28,596
Hey.

56
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:30,870
I was just calling to let
you know I'm not coming into work today.

57
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:33,753
No, no, no, no, no itching.
No itching. Just pat, pat. Par, pat.

58
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,158
Is everything okay?

59
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,421
Oh, everything's fine.
I just hate that stupid Rosie Milano

60
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:40,861
Ugh, is she the woman
at Davey's school with the big,

61
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:42,419
fake boobs who all the dads think are real?

62
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,481
No, but I hate her, too.

63
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:46,114
Rosie Milano is a little girl in Davey's class.

64
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:48,135
Oh. Interesting choice for your nemesis.

65
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:49,732
She came to school with the chicken pox.

66
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:53,299
Oh, no, I hate her, too. Davey and Martha?

67
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,927
Yeah. I mean, not terrible cases.

68
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:56,652
They've both been vaccinated,

69
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,003
but I'm up to my ears in oatmeal baths.

70
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,964
Plus I've got to find a hotel for Jackson

71
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:02,866
because the inn is
completely full -- "go, us," by the way.

72
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,612
Why does Jackson need to stay in a hotel?

73
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:05,991
He's never had the chicken pox.

74
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:09,289
I mean I know he's already
been exposed, so he may get them anyway,

75
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,850
but if there's a chance in
hell to avoid him getting them,

76
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,935
I'm gonna do it because
that man is a huge baby.

77
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:16,210
Well he doesn't need to stay
at a hotel, he can just stay at my place.

78
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:19,382
Lorelai, you are my
best friend in the entire world.

79
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:21,130
I could not sic Jackson on you.

80
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:22,031
Oh, please.

81
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:24,770
No, the man's a slob. This morning,

82
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:26,970
I could have killed him,
with the wet towels all over the floor.

83
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:29,775
It's so not a big deal.
Why waste money on a hotel?

84
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:30,661
Are you sure?

85
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:33,810
Yes. Please, end of discussion. He's staying with me.

86
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:35,628
Okay, well, thank you, and

87
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,678
I want you to remember
this moment because you offered.

88
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:39,001
Okay, well...

89
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,339
Okay. Well, I'm gonna pick him up

90
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,613
and bring him over to you around 6:00.

91
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:45,617
Yeah, that sounds good.
Hey, so I went into Luke's this morning.

92
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,342
What? Why didn't you cut me off?

93
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:49,911
It's not like the kids
have bubonic plague. How did it go?

94
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,602
- It was awful.
- Oh!

95
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:53,781
Yeah everybody was staring at us.

96
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:55,195
Oh, I'm sure they weren't.

97
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:55,789
Sookie.

98
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,056
Yeah, they were staring.

99
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:59,985
Yeah it was just awkward,
and neither of us knew how to act

100
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,751
I'm sure it seemed worse than it really was.

101
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:03,961
Uh, no. We hit the weather in the first minute

102
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:06,289
Well, it has been unseasonably warm,

103
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,414
but you know things will get better.

104
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,374
I don't know. Maybe
there's just too much history.

105
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,562
Oh, history, schmistory.

106
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:14,163
Couples have been
breaking up and becoming friends.

107
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,178
I mean look at Ryan
O'neal and Farrah Fawcett, huh?

108
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,564
Really Ryan and Fawcett that's the most

109
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:19,372
well-adjusted relationship you can come up with?

110
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:21,136
I mean I'm sorry. He's been in the news lately

111
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,150
-- that whole shooting-a-gun-at-his-son thing.

112
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:24,622
Hey, s-- oh! God.

113
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,509
What was that?

114
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,504
- I don't know.
- Oh!

115
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,612
Oh! It's coming from my car.

116
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:31,239
- Pull over.
- I am.

117
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,921
Pull over! Pull over! Pull over!

118
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:35,432
I am. I am. I-I've pulled
over. Hold on. I'm turning it off.

119
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:36,699
Are you okay?

120
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,923
Yeah, I think so.

121
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:39,276
Well, what was that?

122
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:41,723
You know, the carburetor?

123
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,237
Oh. Ooh, or maybe the alternator.

124
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:45,932
I think I better call Gypsy

125
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,240
That's probably a good idea.

126
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,338
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

127
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:58,004
Finally. Doyle, she's here! Where were you?

128
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:00,370
Your "20th century poets"
class ended two hours ago.

129
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:01,134
Hey, Rory.

130
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:03,748
Hey, Doyle. I was
just dropping Logan off at the airport.

131
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,824
Oh yeah he has
that meeting in San Fran. When is it?

132
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:06,416
Tomorrow afternoon.

133
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:07,942
- Wish him luck for me.
- I will.

134
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:09,390
Seriously, you're gonna stand here making idle chitchat

135
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:11,501
on the single most important day of my life?

136
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:13,845
Sorry, sweetie. Paris has some news

137
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:14,796
Not some news, the news.

138
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:17,816
Responses from Harvard medical school,

139
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:20,963
Johns Hopkins school of
medicine, Penn medical, Yale law school,

140
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,819
Stanford law school, and Columbia medical.

141
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,800
And before you comment on envelope thickness,

142
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,665
keep in mind that so much stuff is online

143
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,121
these days that thickness
is no longer an accurate indicator.

144
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:29,695
Mm-hmm

145
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:31,177
I knew you would want
to be here, when I opened them.

146
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:32,760
Yeah, right. Thanks.

147
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:34,655
Go on, hon. Do it!

148
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:38,019
Okay. My lucky letter opener.

149
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,764
Used it to open the envelope conveying

150
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,299
my acceptance to Yale four years ago.

151
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,678
And don't look at me
like I'm some kind of superstitious freak.

152
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:46,256
It's just a precautionary device. If it works, great.

153
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:48,144
If not, I need it to open letters anyway.

154
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:54,370
I don't know which to open first. Choose one.

155
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:58,789
Okay... Yale law school.

156
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,329
Yale law school. Okay,
wow. That's a great school.

157
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,364
I'd be lucky to get in
there, you know? You open it.

158
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:07,559
- Me?
- You're lucky.
- I am?

159
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,869
How else do you explain the fact that

160
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,541
you got into Harvard and I didn't?

161
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:12,647
Oh, right, luck. Okay.

162
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:13,745
Use the letter opener!

163
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:15,829
Oh. Are you sure the letter opener's luck

164
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,297
isn't gonna cancel out my luck?

165
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:18,485
I don't know, is that how it works?

166
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:23,794
I was kidding. Sorry. Here we go. All right.

167
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:30,246
"Dear Paris Geller, we are pleased to inform you --"

168
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:31,274
I got in! Whoo!

169
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:40,552
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you.

170
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:43,252
Thank you. Thank you
so much for your participation

171
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:46,280
in operation finish line,
for your friendship, for everything.

172
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,633
You've always been an
inspiration to me, Rory Gilmore.

173
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,491
Aw.

174
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:51,072
I mean, the way you cut your ruthless path to

175
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:52,954
the head of the Yale daily
news and never looked back --

176
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,890
I never told you, but I really admired that.

177
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:56,038
Thanks?

178
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:58,906
And, Doyle, I know this process

179
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:01,060
didn't exactly bring out my soft and fuzzy side.

180
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:04,995
Doesn't matter. I love you,
baby, and I am so proud of you.

181
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:07,165
I love you, too. I just can't believe

182
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,226
I got into the second
best law school in the country.

183
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:12,524
It's such an honor! It
doesn't matter really if I get into the others.

184
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,923
I have a great option right here.

185
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:14,823
You do.

186
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:19,210
Yeah! Anyway, go ahead.
Might as well open Harvard,

187
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:21,621
even though it doesn't
matter. Use the letter opener again.

188
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:31,790
Okay. Okay.
"We are pleased to inform�"

189
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,344
Whoo! I got in! I got in!

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,431
All right!

191
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:39,506
Congratulations!

192
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:41,105
Bite me, Harvard, bite me!

193
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:41,891
Yeah, chock on it!

194
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:43,799
I'm tempted to reject them the same way

195
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,008
they rejected me that dark day
four years ago. Who's laughing now?!

196
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:51,958
Okay, um, so, next we have,
what? The university of Pennsylvania?

197
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,577
All right.
Let's see what it says.

198
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:03,245
All right. "We are pleased to inform�"

199
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:04,737
- In? I'm in? Yes!
- Oh!

200
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:11,227
-What's that about?
- Hmm?

201
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:13,051
Your noticeable drop-off in enthusiasm.

202
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,424
Is that a reflection of
the fact that you're less impressed by

203
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:17,395
my admission to the
university of Pennsylvania school of medicine

204
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:18,644
than you were by my other acceptances?

205
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,355
I'd say we're just as impressed. Wouldn't you, Doyle?

206
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:24,341
Oh, absolutely.
Because it's a pre-eminent institution in

207
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:26,903
the interrelated disciplines
of patient-care education and research.

208
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,595
- It's a great school.
- Mm, top-notch.

209
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:30,043
Fine, you've made your point.

210
00:09:30,044 --> 00:09:33,114
Perception should play
a role in my decision-making process.

211
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,975
Well I guess that's what Doyle and I were saying.

212
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:37,433
I mean lets face it, you say "Harvard medical school,"

213
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:38,801
and people are automatically impressed

214
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:39,867
and that counts for something.

215
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:40,519
That's true.

216
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,123
SO you think I should go there?

217
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:45,297
Oh, well, that's not what
I'm saying -- or that you shouldn't.

218
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:48,957
I'm just... What I'm saying is
that you have all these great options.

219
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,459
Yeah.

220
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,951
I know. So, how do I decide?

221
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,370
Oh, you'll figure it out, hon.

222
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:56,497
How? This is a huge decision.

223
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:58,617
The biggest decision
I've had to make in my life.

224
00:09:58,652 --> 00:10:01,471
Law school or med school?
I have two passions,

225
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:04,346
and obviously,
I'm vastly talented in both fields.

226
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,523
What muse do I follow?

227
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:08,099
Not to mention location-wise,

228
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,649
where do I want to live for
the next three or up to eight years?

229
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:13,275
Open the others.

230
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:14,963
Yeah?

231
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,937
Okay. Columbia.

232
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:21,112
Also a good school.

233
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:25,933
- "We are pleased�"
- Oh, god!

234
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:28,844
Paris you're just being silly, okay?
It's good to have options.

235
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,643
Yeah, right. You can say that
because there's only one thing you want.

236
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,612
Talk to me if you don't
get the New York Times fellowship

237
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:35,292
and you have to choose
between six other papers.

238
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:43,047
I'm sorry. I just meant it
must be nice to know what you want.

239
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:45,286
Well, "nice" -- yeah, that's one way to put it,

240
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:46,571
and "scary" is another.

241
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:47,809
You have a great shot at the Reston.

242
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,876
You do and with A.J. Abrams writing that rec...

243
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:52,758
Well I'm sure all the candidates
have great recommendations.

244
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,243
New York Times would be
lucky to have you.

245
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:58,294
Thanks. Well, I'll find out
soon enough, but come on.

246
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,892
This is your moment.
Should we open another one?

247
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:09,902
All right.
Hey, hey. You got into Stanford!

248
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,911
- Whoa! Someone's on a roll!
- Yay!

249
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:14,933
Enough with the hysterics.
I have a big decision to make,

250
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:17,486
and all this hooting and
hollering isn't exactly helping matters.

251
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:24,451
What do you mean you can't fix it, gypsy?

252
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:25,597
It's only eight years old.

253
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:28,961
Hi, come on in.
Everyone knows you can fix anything.

254
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:33,686
Sit down. Sorry I have guest,
make yourselves at home okay.

255
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:34,666
- Unh-unh-unh-unh.
- Wha�

256
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:35,819
- Ignore Lorelai.
- What?

257
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,137
You are absolutely not to make yourself at home,

258
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:40,056
don't leave your clothes lying all over the house.

259
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:40,614
I won't.

260
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:42,709
Wipe your shoes off if
you go outside and come back in.

261
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,465
I will. Don't leave
them laying around

262
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:46,550
in the middle of the room or
anywhere where they can be smelled.

263
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:47,041
Sookie.

264
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:49,602
Just don't touch anything,
and hang up your wet towels.

265
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:51,637
I have stayed at other people's houses before.

266
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,533
I know. Why do you think I'm saying all of this?

267
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:55,231
And just try not to annoy Lorelai.

268
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:58,195
Believe it or not, I don't try to annoy other people.

269
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:00,208
Well congratulations,
because you have a natural talent.

270
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,141
- Sookie!
- What?

271
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,605
Nothing. Is that all?

272
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:05,004
No, I packed you a salad.

273
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:07,715
Eat it in the kitchen at the table on a plate.

274
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:09,080
Please do not make a mess.

275
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:11,666
I wanted to stay around
and say thank you to Lorelai,

276
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:12,810
but I should get back to the kids.

277
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:14,040
Yeah, yeah you should get back to the kids.

278
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,828
It sounded like that's gonna take a while.

279
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:16,037
Really?

280
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:17,806
Oh, yeah. They're talking about cars.

281
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:20,235
I mean that phone call could
take hours. Go, really.

282
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:22,340
- Call me if you need anything.
- I will.

283
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,968
And don't use Lorelai's home phone.

284
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:25,178
Kiss the kids good night for me.

285
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:25,877
I will.

286
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:31,948
Thanks for trying. Okay.
Thank you. Bye. 

287
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,548
Sorry about that.

288
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,563
No problem.
Thanks again for letting me stay.

289
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:41,706
Oh, sure, my pleasure.
Have a seat. So, where's Sookie?

290
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:43,261
Oh you know she had to get back to the kids.

291
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:45,391
Oh. Well, how's she holding up?

292
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:49,123
O-okay. A little tense.
What's going on with the car?

293
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,222
Gypsy says I have to put it down.

294
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:51,763
What?

295
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,736
Yes. She said it
would be cheaper to get a new one.

296
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:55,583
She used the phrase "total internal destruction."

297
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:56,330
Wow.

298
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:59,116
I know. I guess that check-engine light
is not just a suggestion.

299
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:00,067
Not so much.

300
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:03,187
Although I'm proud. Total internal
destruction -- that sounds badass.

301
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:04,180
So what's next?

302
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:06,784
Uh, I guess I turn my evil
power on some new, unsuspecting vehicle.

303
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,883
Do you know what you're gonna get?

304
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:09,447
No. Any suggestions?

305
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:11,363
Honestly, I'm not a car guy,

306
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:12,772
but I can steer you toward a good tractor.

307
00:13:12,773 --> 00:13:14,722
Al right. If I decide to get a tractor,
you're my guy.

308
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,138
Hey, do you need a ride
to work tomorrow?

309
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:18,556
Phil Henderson's gonna pick me up.

310
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:20,732
We could drop you off
on the way to the farm.

311
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,323
Well that's nice.
What time are you going?

312
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:23,414
About 4:45.

313
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:26,040
No, no, no. That's too early.
I'll take my bike.

314
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:26,705
You bike?

315
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,376
Well, I don't bike, but I have a bike.

316
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:30,260
There were about two weeks when Rory was 10

317
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:31,505
that we were really into biking.

318
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,506
Then we got over it and moved on to roller skating,

319
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:36,077
but for those two weeks, it was biking all the way.

320
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:36,869
12 years ago?

321
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,204
Is that how long ago it was? Oh, well. I'll be fine.

322
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:43,012
They must have the phrase
"it's just like riding a bike" for a reason.

323
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,408
Okay, so, I'm gonna get
a snack. You want to join me?

324
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,939
Uh, actually, no. Sookie made me a salad.

325
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:52,698
I'm making chicken nuggets.
I won't tell. Come on.

326
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:00,461
- Hello?
- Hi, mom.

327
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:01,563
Oh, why so blue?

328
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm not blue.

329
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,609
Come on, talk to me.

330
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,759
All I said was, "hi, mom."

331
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,809
Are you missing Logan?
Is he getting back from San Francisco soon?

332
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,015
On Friday, but that's not why I'm blue.

333
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,867
I'm not even blue. Well, I'm not really blue.

334
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,142
Well, why are you not blue?

335
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,700
Well, Paris got into six schools yesterday,

336
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,812
which means she's definitely going to grad school,

337
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:21,116
and I'm happy for her.
I mean, I'm happy for Lucy and Olivia,

338
00:14:21,117 --> 00:14:23,014
who signed a lease on an apartment in Manhattan well,

339
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,640
near Manhattan. And I'm happy
for this guy in my Shakespeare class

340
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:28,746
who just got recruited for
a think tank in Washington.

341
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:30,158
Wow, that's a lot of happy.

342
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,818
Yeah, that's just it. All of a sudden,

343
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:34,889
everyone seems to know
where they're gonna be next year.

344
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,272
Oh, and you're still waiting to hear?

345
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:38,805
Yeah. I mean, I really want the Reston.

346
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:40,771
And I think you're gonna get it, I really do.

347
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:42,425
But you have other places you're waiting to hear from.

348
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,368
I know, but to live in
New York city and work at the times.

349
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,977
Well, if I say it'll work out, does that help?

350
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:48,542
Not really.

351
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:50,324
- Consider it unsaid.
- Thanks.

352
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:51,612
What kind of think tank?

353
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:53,146
I know, I know I should have asked,

354
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:55,562
but I temporarily forgot
your fascination with think tanks.

355
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,252
Does the guy have a big forehead?

356
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:59,094
I always picture the
think-tank guys with big foreheads.

357
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:01,795
No, he has a pretty
average-sized forehead. Average to small.

358
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:02,890
Interesting.

359
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:04,664
Mm. Hey, why do you sound out of breath?

360
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:05,608
I don't know.

361
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,302
Did you have too much coffee this morning?

362
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:09,062
Haven't had any. I didn't go to Luke's.

363
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,082
Oh, I thought you were
going for a second run.

364
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,733
Well, maybe tomorrow.

365
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:14,698
Mom just do it, I know it's hard,

366
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,215
but you guys need to get over this hump.

367
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,327
I promise I'll go back.

368
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:19,573
It's just there's been a
lot going on with the car and everything.

369
00:15:19,574 --> 00:15:20,901
Oh, what did gypsy say?

370
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:23,384
- It's bad.
- Uh-oh.

371
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:25,635
- Doorknobs.
- As in "dead as"?

372
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,947
- That's right.
- Why? How?

373
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:29,868
Oh, ours is not to wonder why.

374
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:30,998
But it was so young.

375
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:31,925
I know.

376
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:34,586
It just seems like
yesterday that we went to pick it out.

377
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:35,190
Yeah.

378
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:37,101
Oh. So new car, huh?

379
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,713
You should get a DeLorean like in "back to the future."

380
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,085
It's on the list right behind the Batmobile.

381
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:43,078
Although I'm enjoying the whole biking thing

382
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:43,955
What biking thing?

383
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,392
I'm biking to work right now.

384
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:46,556
What, now? Mom.

385
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:48,169
- What?
- Pull over.

386
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,330
- No!
-That's dangerous.

387
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:53,811
Oh, I'm fine. I've been
talking to you with a little ear thingy.

388
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:55,094
Well, pull over right now.

389
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:57,838
Okay, I'm pulling over, pulling over. Okay, I pulled over.

390
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,365
Yeah, I know you're not. I'm hanging up.

391
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:00,657
Okay, bye!

392
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,667
Hey, anything good?

393
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:10,445
- Um, here's one that comes
loaded with an entertainment pkg.
- "Package."

394
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:12,835
Right. Satellite radio, six-cd changer.

395
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:15,686
I'm just not sure if these
are cars or really expensive stereos.

396
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:17,637
Ooh, you should get a convertible.

397
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:19,485
I'm not a convertible person.

398
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:21,077
What is a convertible person?

399
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:23,075
You know, too tan, bad hair.

400
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,418
Hey, don't put the tomatoes in
until 10 minutes before you serve

401
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,720
Ooh! How about that little sports car?

402
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,784
Yeah, I don't know, I always
feel like sports cars have an attitude,

403
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:33,628
you know like they think they're cooler than other cars.

404
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:36,149
That's true, although from
where I'm sitting in my minivan,

405
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,441
they do seem a lot cooler.

406
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:41,014
So, thanks again for, you know, having Jackson.

407
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:42,465
I know how difficult he can be.

408
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:43,461
Oh, he's great.

409
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,070
Good. You can tell me the truth.

410
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,378
I know he's driving you crazy, right?

411
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,399
He's great. We had fun. We watched TV.

412
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,673
He went to bed early. It was fun.

413
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:53,294
Oh. He's probably on his good behavior.

414
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:56,304
He woke you up when he
got up this morning, didn't he?

415
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:57,810
- No.
- He didn't?
- No.

416
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:00,486
Oh, with all that stomp, stomp, stomping around.

417
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,187
Sookie, is everything okay with you two?

418
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,408
Oh, yeah, yeah. Fine, fine, fine.

419
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,731
He's just kind of getting
on my nerves a little, you know.

420
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:10,917
I'm just cranky. The little
one's keeping me up at night.

421
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:14,368
So, talk to me. What are you thinking?

422
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,760
How about a mini?

423
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:17,362
Oh, how about a Rolls-Royce?

424
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:18,807
Yeah, I'll consider that.

425
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:22,875
Or a Bentley, Aston Martin,
Mercedes, a BMW.

426
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,631
What are you doing,
just listing expensive cars?

427
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:27,214
Take out a second mortgage
on your home. It will be worth it.

428
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:28,892
Michel, be quiet.

429
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:30,884
People are impressed by fine automobiles.

430
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:33,838
It's how the world works.
Don't look at me like that.

431
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,644
I didn't make the rules. I just play by them.

432
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:36,790
Yeah, but you drive a golf.

433
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,185
Would you like to give me a raise?

434
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:42,899
Ignore him! Okay, here's what
I want you to do. Close your eyes.

435
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,655
Ooh, fun.

436
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:45,985
Now, I want you to imagine your dream car.

437
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:48,989
It can be anything you want.
You're backing out of the driveway.

438
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,995
You're driving through Stars Hollow.

439
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:52,993
"Good morning, townspeople!
Top of the morning to you."

440
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,485
Why am I saying "top of the morning"?

441
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:55,437
It doesn't matter what you say.

442
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:58,400
It matters what you're in.
Can you see what you're in?

443
00:17:58,401 --> 00:17:59,922
I think I can see it!

444
00:17:59,923 --> 00:18:01,611
Okay, what kind of car is it?

445
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:03,081
It's not really a car. It's more of a float.

446
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:03,684
A float?

447
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:05,835
In the shape of a swan, and I'm dressed all in white.

448
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,126
Okay, that's not a very practical car

449
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,463
Al right. What are you looking at?

450
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,527
I was trying to decide
if you could pull off a Ferrari.

451
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:12,607
Mm, you can't.

452
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,633
Maybe I'll get a really cool vintage car.

453
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:18,144
A used car? You cannot be serious.

454
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,396
What's wrong with a used car?

455
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:21,099
Would you buy a used toilet seat?

456
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,425
It's not really the same thing.

457
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:23,897
You're sitting in someone else's filth.

458
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:24,894
With pants on.

459
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,018
One can only hope.

460
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:27,746
Ew, Michel.

461
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:29,484
You don't know who drove it before.

462
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:30,912
No but I think I could have it cleaned.

463
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:33,394
Aw, you're right and I'm
sure they got out all the sweat,

464
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,873
body odor, and head lice
that a previous owner deposited.

465
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:38,698
Ew! Shouldn't you be
somewhere, like the reception desk?

466
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:41,617
- Suit yourself.
- Ew, ew.

467
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:44,867
I know. And now if you get a cool old vintage car,

468
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:45,961
I don't think I can sit in it.

469
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:48,031
Listen, don't worry. I'm getting a new car.

470
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:50,267
I have more money now than I did eight years ago,

471
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:54,208
and I can afford something
nice, you know, with all the perks.

472
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,368
Yeah, that makes sense.

473
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,026
I just don't know where to start.

474
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:58,462
I wish I could be more helpful.

475
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:01,201
- You know this is something Luke would be good at.
-Yeah

476
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:03,988
I mean, in the old days,
you know, before everything,

477
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:04,834
when we were just friends,

478
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:06,847
this is something I'd ask for his help with.

479
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:08,490
Well, I mean, maybe you could.

480
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,913
Could I? I couldn't. Could I?

481
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:11,478
You're talking. You're friends again

482
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,520
Well, sort of friends. We have a long way to go

483
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:14,921
Well, you will be eventually.

484
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:17,080
You think something like this
would help us get over the hump?

485
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:20,134
Yeah, and you've got a
built-in safe topic of conversation.

486
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:21,960
Yeah. Maybe I will.

487
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,534
Great. I think it's a great idea.

488
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,235
All right, me too. I'll let you know how it goes.

489
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:32,093
Okay, I'll be here.
Ooh. Hello? Hey, Jackson.

490
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:34,545
No. Whoa. Wait a -- wait a minute.

491
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:37,661
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. You did what?

492
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:52,012
Hey. It's Lorelai. It's me. Hi.  Are you busy?

493
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:55,777
Um, no, no, no. I just
had a -- I had a quick question.

494
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,622
It's kind of a favor, really.
Um, my car is totally shot,

495
00:19:58,623 --> 00:20:00,435
and I need to buy a new car, and I just

496
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:03,008
don't know anything about it,
and I thought maybe sometime

497
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:06,211
and if you don't have time,
it's really no big deal  but ma today?

498
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:10,555
Oh...yeah. I mean, it doesn't have to sure.

499
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:16,361
Yeah, we'll go look. Um, I don't know, like 1:30?

500
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:21,239
Can you pick me up at the inn? Hey, thanks. Bye.

501
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:29,198
I was gonna put the radio on,
but it's been pretty static-y lately.

502
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,499
Oh, I'm fine. I don't need music.

503
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,747
Yeah? Okay.

504
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,124
Thanks again for agreeing to come

505
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:35,965
No problem.

506
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:38,565
And again, I mean, it didn't
have to be, you know, today.

507
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:41,587
Oh, no, you know, the diner was slow,

508
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,455
and you can't keep riding that bike around.

509
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:45,646
Why does everyone act like I'm a really bad biker?

510
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:47,615
No, hey, I didn't mean it that way.

511
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:48,692
- I'm just kidding.
- Oh.

512
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:49,743
- It was a joke.
- Okay.

513
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:54,196
So, um, April left, right?

514
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:55,906
Yeah, but she'll be back in June.

515
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:57,096
Oh, for the big boat trip?

516
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:58,230
- Right, right.
- That's gonna be fun.

517
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:00,016
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?

518
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:01,426
- Yeah
- Oh, good.

519
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:09,848
You know, I don't mind a little static.

520
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,672
I was gonna say, it actually doesn't work that bad.

521
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:21,443
Have a nice life!

522
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:23,106
Doyle, is everything okay?

523
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:24,575
Oh, yeah, everything's great.

524
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,780
My girlfriend of 2 1/2 years
just broke up with me,

525
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:27,943
but other than that...

526
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:28,970
She did? Why?

527
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:29,971
Who knows? Maybe because she's psycho!

528
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:32,533
I am not psycho!

529
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:33,433
Oh, yes, you are!

530
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,139
What happened?

531
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,294
Take that back!

532
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,721
Ask Paris. I will not take it back because

533
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:39,587
you are a certifiable nut job!

534
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:43,527
And, hey, if you find out
why we broke up, let me know.

535
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:44,891
Oh, but, Doyle, where are you gonna go?

536
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:47,489
Crashing on my metro
editor's couch for a couple of days,

537
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,354
then I'll be back for my stuff. See you around.

538
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:52,138
See you around.

539
00:21:59,218 --> 00:21:59,935
Is he gone?

540
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,340
Yeah. What happened?

541
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:04,764
- We broke up.
- But why?

542
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:06,440
I have a really big decision to make,

543
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:08,113
and I'm not about to let him influence it.

544
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:10,665
Was he trying to pressure
you into staying in Connecticut next year?

545
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,617
Well, no, not overtly, 
but it was in the air.

546
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:17,572
And statistically,
taking into account my geographic

547
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:18,986
and socioeconomic background,

548
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:21,830
the chances of me remaining
with my college boyfriend are slim.

549
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:24,337
So how am I gonna feel in 20 years
when I look back

550
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:26,121
and realize that I based
such a huge decision

551
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:29,366
on some college guy who may or may
not make the holiday newsletter cutoff?

552
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,753
But you love him.

553
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:32,691
- Yeah, well, I'll deal.
- Paris.

554
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:35,075
- Look, I really don't want to talk about it, okay?
- Okay.

555
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:39,030
The good news is I came up
with a point system to evaluate

556
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:41,819
each institution based on faculty, earning potential,

557
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,332
location, prestige, and perception of prestige,

558
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,301
which I've decided is worth two points.

559
00:22:46,302 --> 00:22:48,747
I'm not proud of that but
like you taught me with your U. .

560
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:50,002
Penn reaction, that's how the world works

561
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:52,001
Well, I'm glad to see you're making progress.

562
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:55,612
As if. Three more acceptances. It's crazy.

563
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:57,711
I mean I always thought that I'd be able to decide

564
00:22:57,712 --> 00:22:59,963
between medicine and law
based on the quality of schools

565
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:02,741
I was offered entrance to,
but at this point, it's a toss-up. 

566
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:03,476
Everyone wants me.

567
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:04,908
Well, I'm sure you'll make
the right decision.

568
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:07,392
Of course I will. What do
you think the point system's for?

569
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:12,131
Right. So, the mail got here.
Anything for me?

570
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:13,114
Nothing from the times.

571
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:14,827
It'll come.

572
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,243
Yeah, I know. It's just waiting sucks.

573
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:18,063
Yeah, it does.

574
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,276
Hey, it's Lucy! I just
wanted to give you a heads up for tonight,

575
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:22,981
8:00 P.M., Rich Man's Shoe.

576
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:24,538
Get ready to toast Glenda.

577
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,769
That's what we named
our new apartment. I'll tell you why later.

578
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,530
They named their new apartment?

579
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:29,249
I guess so.

580
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,362
Weird. So, you're gonna go?

581
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:35,184
Yeah, I was going to. Do you want to come?

582
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:36,067
I might as well.

583
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:37,624
I mean Doyle and I were
supposed to see a movie

584
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,962
but guess that's not gonna happen.

585
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:41,272
- Paris, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. 

586
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:43,839
Trust me, it's not like I've been
dying to see "Blades of Glory" anyway.

587
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,577
I'd better get started on my
phone calls for the alumni surveys.

588
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,721
I was admiring it, you know?

589
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:06,645
And then I got to thinking
that I could make Martha one,

590
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,958
so I picked it up to see
what the support system was like,

591
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:12,471
only it was heavier than
I thought, and, well, I dropped it.

592
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:13,270
You dropped it.

593
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:15,009
Yes. And then I fell on it.

594
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,721
Jackson.

595
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,177
I was trying to catch it!

596
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:18,553
You broke the only thing from

597
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:20,549
Lorelai's childhood that she actually liked!

598
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,186
I know. I know!

599
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,000
- How could you?
- It was an accident.

600
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:25,414
Well why did you have to touch it?

601
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:27,084
I told you, I was just looking at it.

602
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:29,019
Well, you look with your eyes,
not with your hands.

603
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,007
Well, maybe we could,
you know, find a similar dollhouse.

604
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:32,819
Oh, good idea.

605
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,018
Let's just sneak it in in the middle of

606
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,531
the night like we did with Davey's goldfish.

607
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,951
I'm just trying to think.
Maybe I could try and put it back together?

608
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:40,285
Yeah, you're so handy.

609
00:24:40,286 --> 00:24:42,547
Okay, you know what? That's enough.

610
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:43,294
What's enough?

611
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:45,654
I know what this is
about, and it's not this dollhouse

612
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:46,525
Of course it is.

613
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:50,006
No, it's not. This is about me
lying to you and you getting pregnant.

614
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:51,222
What are you talking about?

615
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:55,082
All this anger you have
toward me. That's where this is coming from.

616
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,592
It's not. I told you I'm excited about the baby.

617
00:24:57,593 --> 00:24:59,387
I know but that's not the same as forgiving me,

618
00:24:59,388 --> 00:25:00,345
which you haven't done.

619
00:25:00,346 --> 00:25:01,767
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

620
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:03,250
- I have.
- You haven't.
- I have

621
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,542
- You haven't.
-  Fine, I haven't! Are you happy?

622
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:06,777
No, I'm not.

623
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:11,731
Well... I don't want to be mad. I don't.

624
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:19,270
It's just that every time
my feet hurt or my back gets sore or

625
00:25:19,271 --> 00:25:21,726
Davey and Martha have a tantrum or get the chicken pox,

626
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:24,429
I get scared about having a third kid.

627
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,990
And then I feel bad for feeling like that,

628
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:29,461
and then I get mad at you for making me feel like that.

629
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:33,629
I understand. I do. Heck, I'm still mad at myself.

630
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,813
It's just that at some point,
you are gonna forgive me eventually, right?

631
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:42,687
It's just sometimes it feels really overwhelming.

632
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:45,256
I know, but you got to let me back in.

633
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:48,695
- I want to. I do.
- Okay.

634
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:55,781
Okay. You were thinking
about making a dollhouse for Martha?

635
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:57,324
She'd really like that, wouldn't she?

636
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:06,712
Yeah. She would. Boy,
you really plowed into that thing.

637
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:09,293
- Oh, yeah.
- Hm

638
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:10,819
- Hmm.
- No?

639
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,987
No. Sorry it's taking so long.

640
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:16,848
No, not at all. It's a big
purchase. You're buying a car.

641
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:18,368
You should take your time. I mean,

642
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,167
I'm sorry if you feel like I'm rushing you

643
00:26:21,168 --> 00:26:22,165
Oh, you're not.

644
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,693
No? Good. Because, you know, I've got plenty of time

645
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:25,237
Good, me too.

646
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:28,666
So, um, what didn't you like about that one,

647
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:31,077
specifically, so we can kind of narrow things down?

648
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:33,999
Um, the whole thing. I don't know. It's a feeling.

649
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,190
It's hard to explain like with the wrangler,

650
00:26:35,191 --> 00:26:37,767
I just got in and I had a
feeling. I didn't get the feeling there.

651
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:39,463
- Yeah, right.
- Huh?

652
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,580
- Huh.
- Hmm.

653
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:43,549
- No, no. I just was clearing my throat.
- Oh.

654
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,399
How about a Prius?

655
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,083
Oh, yeah, I can't. Rory has one.

656
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:47,811
She doesn't like it?

657
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:50,155
No, she does. It's just
we made a pact no matching cars.

658
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:51,832
You know 'cause it's a slippery slope between

659
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,623
matching cars and then matching sweatsuits.

660
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:55,234
- Of course.
- Huh?

661
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:56,788
I just said, "of course."

662
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:00,795
Oh, okay. Yeah I'm sorry
if this is frustrating for you.

663
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:03,369
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all. It's not frustrating at all.

664
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,989
It's fun. But, I mean, look, if you want to leave

665
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,118
Oh, no, no. No, no, I'm having fun.

666
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,397
Good. Good, good, good.
So, what about a little hatchback?

667
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:20,810
Oh! Well, let's see here. Hmm.

668
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:23,203
It's got a power thingy in the console.

669
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:25,032
That could be convenient, you know,

670
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:27,345
if I need to use a hair dryer if I'm running late.

671
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:31,057
- That's useful.
- Oh. Excuse me.

672
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:32,116
- Yeah okay.
- Be right back.

673
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:37,978
Make them go car shopping with their exes.

674
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:39,861
Still awkward, huh?

675
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:42,378
Still? I'm gonna buy a car just to get out of here.

676
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:44,716
No, don't. Just leave.

677
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:47,099
I want to, and I can tell that he wants to,

678
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,510
but neither of us want to say that we want to.

679
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,583
Oh.

680
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,835
Yeah, I don't know how Ryan and Farrah do it,

681
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,378
'cause this whole friendship thing is not working out.

682
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:56,198
Oh. It'll be possible, eventually.

683
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:59,533
I guess. I just can't take it anymore. What's going on?

684
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:01,035
- Hmm?
- You called me.

685
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:06,337
Oh! Well, um, I just wanted
to see how things were going,

686
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:08,266
and now you told me really, really bad.

687
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,557
Yeah, add about 10 reallys to that.

688
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,877
Wow, 12. That's, um, wow.
Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later.

689
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:17,371
Yeah, okay, bye.

690
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:21,761
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, great.

691
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:24,387
All right, good. Look, I was talking to the salesman.

692
00:28:24,388 --> 00:28:26,640
He said there's a bunch of other models that way.

693
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,326
- Great.
- Okay, so...

694
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:37,777
- Well?
- Well.

695
00:28:37,778 --> 00:28:39,632
You've been talking about your jeep all day,

696
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:40,224
I know.

697
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:41,287
Comparing other cars to it.

698
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:42,153
- I know.
- Here it is.

699
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:44,101
I'm sorry.

700
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:46,567
But I don't understand. It's the same car.

701
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:47,659
It's not the same car.

702
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,433
What do you mean?

703
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:49,815
What do you mean? It's different.

704
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:51,438
It's not different. It's just a newer model.

705
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,498
No, it's different. The steering wheel,

706
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:54,991
the seats are different, the cup holder.

707
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:56,614
Okay there have been improvements.

708
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:57,595
They made some changes.

709
00:28:57,596 --> 00:28:58,958
- Improvements.
- Says who?

710
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:01,285
What exactly is bugging you?

711
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:05,053
It's not bugging me per se. It's just it's different.

712
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:06,177
I don't get that feeling

713
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,812
- Oh, for god's sake.
- What?

714
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,657
- You're being ridiculous.
- Why?

715
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:11,826
You don't buy a car based on a feeling.

716
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:14,315
No. You don't buy a car based on a feeling.

717
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:16,739
It's not just me. It's the
whole rest of the population

718
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,065
Really? You took a poll,

719
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:21,171
and you know how everyone else buys their car?

720
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:22,978
I don't have to. I already
know what they're gonna say.

721
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:25,131
Well, I am the person buying the car,

722
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:27,226
and so the only opinion
that matters is mine.

723
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:28,862
Oh, that is so like you.

724
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:30,980
I mean this is bathroom tiles all over again.

725
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:32,508
- I was right about the tile.
- No, you weren't.

726
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,237
The tile was too big for the bathroom.

727
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:35,937
Tiles are not too big for a bathroom.

728
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:37,647
You buy the amount of tiles based on

729
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:39,475
their size that fit into the room you are tiling!

730
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:40,933
So narrow-minded.

731
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:43,370
That's not narrow-minded. Okay it's sane,

732
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:45,509
and here's a news flash for you, okay?

733
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,090
Sports cars don't think
they're better than other cars.

734
00:29:48,091 --> 00:29:51,898
Okay. Hatchbacks don't
have SUV inferiority complexes.

735
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:55,791
- Now who's ridiculous?
- And sedans aren't afraid to get dirty.

736
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:57,196
You know what I think it is? That you're hungry.

737
00:29:57,197 --> 00:29:58,017
What? No.

738
00:29:58,018 --> 00:29:59,447
Sometimes you get like this when you're hungry.

739
00:29:59,448 --> 00:29:59,960
I'm not.

740
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:02,022
I think I have some cookies in here, some Oreos.

741
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:04,518
I'm not and besides I wouldn't
eat anything that came out of that bag.

742
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,561
They're in a wrapper.

743
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:08,216
I can't believe you still
haven't cleaned that thing out.

744
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:08,726
Please.

745
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:10,671
How much time do you lose
a day looking through that thing?

746
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:12,529
5, 10 minutes? Multiply that by a year.

747
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,766
I bet you'd gain a month if you
just took an hour and cleaned it out,

748
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,459
but no -- what?

749
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,690
- Nothing.
- You're smiling.

750
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,681
What? No. You've got low blood sugar.

751
00:30:21,682 --> 00:30:26,190
I do not have� okay,
are you gonna buy a car or not?

752
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:27,781
Not.

753
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:29,586
Okay can we get out of here, then?

754
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:30,378
Gladly.

755
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:33,652
And we're not listening
to any of that crap on the radio.

756
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:34,605
- It's not crap.
- Yeah, it's crap

757
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:36,402
It's Air Supply. You
know what you need a milkshake.

758
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:37,403
- We're not stopping for a milkshake.

759
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:38,395
- Okay let's rock, paper, scissors.

760
00:30:38,396 --> 00:30:39,773
- No, no, no.
- So you forfeit?
- No, I�

761
00:30:39,774 --> 00:30:40,774
Well, that's how it goes.

762
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:44,225
If you don't play the game, then you forfeit.

763
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:44,457
- Let's get you in the car

764
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,318
- That means a giant milkshake for you, my friend.

765
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,415
We're not stopping.

766
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:52,168
-Chocolate. That's gonna set you up.
-We're not stopping. Not gonna happen.

767
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:59,054
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Lorelai.
- Hiya.

768
00:30:59,055 --> 00:30:59,921
- How's it going?

769
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:02,756
Oh, we're just enjoying the afternoon.

770
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:05,386
It's such A...nice day out. Come join us.

771
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:05,771
Okay.

772
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:07,494
Hey, how'd it turn out with Luke?

773
00:31:07,495 --> 00:31:08,840
Oh, he got mad at me.

774
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:09,368
I'm sorry.

775
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:12,390
Oh, it was so great. I mean
we've been so polite to each other,

776
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:13,985
and I knew he was frustrated with me,

777
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:16,277
and I was definitely
frustrated with him, and finally,

778
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:18,664
he snapped, and we
started bickering, and it was nice.

779
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:20,570
- Ah.
- More normal, you know?

780
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:21,995
The fighting got you over the hump.

781
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,546
Yeah. I cannot find a car, though.

782
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:24,416
Did you see anything you like?

783
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:28,208
No. I mean kind of,
but they all have this new-car smell,

784
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:29,659
which apparently people like, but I don't like it.

785
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,862
I like the way my old car
smelled and the way the zipper got stuck

786
00:31:32,863 --> 00:31:34,473
on the window and the little place where

787
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:36,073
Rory signed her name in permanent marker.

788
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:37,474
Lots of memories, huh?

789
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:40,596
It was the first new car I bought
and the car I taught Rory to drive in,.

790
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:44,618
and I know I have to move on.
I know that whatever new car,

791
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:47,146
tractor, float, I get will be great.

792
00:31:47,147 --> 00:31:49,508
It's just been a more
emotional experience than I thought

793
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,849
-Makes sense.
- Yeah. It does.

794
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,559
What's wrong with you two?

795
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,384
We have to tell you
something, and it's really bad timing

796
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:57,890
because we're talking about memories,

797
00:31:57,891 --> 00:32:01,640
and the thing we have to tell
you was associated with a lot of memories,

798
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:03,681
but we have to tell you, so I'm just gonna tell you.

799
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:05,981
- What is it?
- Jackson broke your dollhouse.

800
00:32:05,982 --> 00:32:08,740
Oh. How broke?

801
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:11,635
In a box in pieces. Trust me, you don't want to look.

802
00:32:12,657 --> 00:32:14,653
- Oh.
- I am so sorry.

803
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:17,673
No, it's my fault. I had you on edge.

804
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:20,718
I had him on edge. We're both so sorry.

805
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,559
Oh, no, that's okay. It was an accident.

806
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,584
Well, the good news -- not good news.

807
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:28,011
I mean, the not-quite-so-devastating news is that

808
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,346
we found someone online
that is apparently a wizard with,

809
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:32,847
you know, restoring dollhouses,

810
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:35,061
and we're driving all the pieces over there tomorrow.

811
00:32:35,062 --> 00:32:38,046
Oh, thanks. I'm sure it'll be fine.

812
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,963
Yeah, everything can be fixed, huh?

813
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:43,544
Yeah. Is that why you guys are sitting out here?

814
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,231
Pretty much.

815
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:46,817
Oh. You want to head on in?

816
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:48,127
Sounds good. Yow.

817
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:55,964
That's a living room,
and our bedrooms will be here.

818
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:57,360
We're gonna put partitions up.

819
00:32:57,361 --> 00:32:59,262
Aesthetically, Japanese screens would be nice.

820
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:01,261
But privacy-wise, we definitely need partitions.

821
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:03,239
- Well, it looks great.
-Oh, it's not great.

822
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,115
- owhere near great.
-What it is, is cheap.

823
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,306
Which is even better than great since the gallery

824
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:08,903
is paying me $21,000 a year,

825
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,156
and I'm gonna have to
start paying off student loans.

826
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:11,901
How, I don't know

827
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:13,574
We'll make a budget. You'll swing it.

828
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,481
I hope so.

829
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:16,133
Is it near the subway?

830
00:33:16,134 --> 00:33:16,859
That's the best part.

831
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,540
It's right near the "W"
then you transfer to the 7 or the "N."

832
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,871
I wouldn't say it's the
best part. It's definitely a schlepp.

833
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,011
But it's a doable schlepp.

834
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:25,890
Totally doable. If you get
the Reston, you should look in our area.

835
00:33:25,891 --> 00:33:30,234
Oh, I definitely will. Um,
hey, is there student housing at Columbia?

836
00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:32,332
- you got into Columbia?
- Yeah.

837
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,478
You should go! How much
fun will it be when we're all in the city?

838
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,415
Maybe. Are you gonna finish that?

839
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:44,180
- Uh, no. Go for it.
- Olivia, darts?

840
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:46,460
You're on. Let's play for
the bedroom with the window.

841
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:55,881
- Paris, are you okay?
- Me? Yeah, sure.

842
00:33:57,194 --> 00:33:57,790
- Come on.

843
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:02,377
I just miss him, you know. It's hard.

844
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:06,659
I know. You didn't have to break up with him, though.

845
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,346
Yes. I did.

846
00:34:09,286 --> 00:34:11,143
Well, if you thought that he was pressuring you,

847
00:34:11,144 --> 00:34:12,859
couldn't you have just talked to him about it?

848
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,391
- He wasn't.
- Well, then why?

849
00:34:16,392 --> 00:34:20,326
It was me, okay? Doyle said to make my decision.

850
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:24,136
He said not to worry
about him. He said wherever I went,

851
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:29,856
we'd work it out. So I tried,
you know, not to think about him,

852
00:34:29,857 --> 00:34:33,455
to take him out of the equation, but I couldn't.

853
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:35,912
Every time I tried to evaluate a school,

854
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:38,297
I'd immediately think about it in relation to Doyle.

855
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:41,575
"How close is it to him?
"Is there a good newspaper nearby?

856
00:34:41,576 --> 00:34:42,961
What will the commute be like?"

857
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:45,364
Well, those are all valid questions.

858
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:46,484
No, they're not.

859
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:50,402
This decision is the culmination
of everything I've ever worked for,

860
00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:53,964
everything. I should choose
a school based on its merits,

861
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:56,501
not based on its proximity to some guy.

862
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:58,103
But Doyle's not just some guy.

863
00:34:58,104 --> 00:35:04,141
I know. But I'm only 22.
This wasn't supposed to happen yet.

864
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:07,660
I wasn't supposed to meet the guy until I was 30 and

865
00:35:07,661 --> 00:35:10,470
clerking for a federal judge
or finishing up my residency

866
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:14,393
and when I knew where
I'd be when I was ready to settle down.

867
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:15,636
Yeah, but you can't plan everything.

868
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:17,929
I mean, you fell in love. That's a good thing.

869
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,333
Are you willing to make
a decision this big based on Logan?

870
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:23,368
Well, actually, we talked about it,

871
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:25,448
and we're gonna factor each other in.

872
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:26,524
What does that mean?

873
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:29,730
It just means we're gonna take each other

874
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,353
into consideration when we make decisions.

875
00:35:31,354 --> 00:35:35,128
Okay. So carry that thought out.

876
00:35:35,129 --> 00:35:38,191
Let's say you get The New York Times
fellowship and

877
00:35:38,192 --> 00:35:41,095
Logan's meetings in San Francisco go incredibly well

878
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,602
and he wants to move there.
Do you take a job in San Francisco?

879
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,894
The chronicle is a perfectly adequate paper.

880
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,688
Or do you go to The New York Times?

881
00:35:50,557 --> 00:35:51,280
The New York Times.

882
00:35:51,281 --> 00:35:54,204
Then we're saying
the same thing, aren't we?

883
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:55,388
No, not at all.

884
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:59,127
You're saying your career
is your priority over your relationship.

885
00:35:59,128 --> 00:35:59,993
They're both priorities.

886
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:01,503
But your career comes first.

887
00:36:01,504 --> 00:36:03,887
Well, I didn't say it comes first. I --

888
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:07,086
I'm just not ready to make any sacrifices in that area yet.

889
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:10,471
But you are willing to
make sacrifices in your relationship.

890
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:13,956
Hence, your career is
more important to you, just like me.

891
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:16,076
Well, I wouldn't say "more important."

892
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:19,059
I guess I just thought that if Logan and

893
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,421
I have to do long-distance again, we'll make it work.

894
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:29,365
Sure. Maybe. Then again,
choosing to be apart might be...

895
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:31,514
choosing to be apart.

896
00:36:56,326 --> 00:36:59,911
- Oh! Hey, Luke.
- Hey, Jackson.

897
00:36:59,912 --> 00:37:02,731
- How you been, man?
- Uh, not too bad.

898
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:03,291
You want to come in?

899
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:04,891
Uh, no, that's okay. Is Lorelai here?

900
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:07,395
Yeah, hang on. Lorelai, it's Luke!

901
00:37:07,396 --> 00:37:10,175
We thought you were the
pizza guy. We're getting pizza tonight,

902
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:11,890
with pepperoni and meatballs and sausage

903
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:14,213
and those extra-crispy, cheesy garlic knots,

904
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:16,037
and we're eating everything on the couch.

905
00:37:16,038 --> 00:37:18,047
Well, that sounds...fun.

906
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:20,341
Yeah, right! Chicken-nugget appetizer?

907
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:21,390
I'm good, I'm good.

908
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:22,399
- Hi.
- Hi.

909
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:24,553
Oh, well, good to see you, buddy.

910
00:37:24,554 --> 00:37:26,249
Yeah, you too.

911
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,677
What's going on?

912
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,225
Okay, here's the deal. I borrowed Kirk's computer,

913
00:37:31,226 --> 00:37:32,364
and Zach got me on this craigslist thing,

914
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:35,895
and I found a 1999 jeep wrangler for sale.

915
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:38,719
The guy actually doesn't live
too far from here, so I went to see it.

916
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,614
It looks like it's in pretty
good shape. So I ran the VIN number.

917
00:37:41,615 --> 00:37:44,126
It's got a clean history
- no accidents, no failed emissions.

918
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:46,166
And the guy said he kept it up pretty good,

919
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,999
and there's nothing really
wrong with it. So I took it for a test drive,

920
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,640
and it drove fine. So if you want to keep your old car,

921
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:54,454
for whatever crazy feeling it gives you, okay?

922
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:56,708
Then buy this guy's car, send it to gypsy.

923
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:59,062
She'll take the engine out, put it in the old car,

924
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:01,438
which makes absolutely no sense because you'd basically

925
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,875
be paying the same amount of money to fix your old car

926
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:06,280
as you would be paying to get into a new one.

927
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:07,468
But I'd still have my car.

928
00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:09,647
Yeah, gypsy said it'll take about two weeks to finish.

929
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:10,648
Here's the number of the guy, Larry. That's his name.

930
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:14,324
I already negotiated him down 1,500 bucks.

931
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,148
Tell him you're Lorelai, Luke's friend. He'll know.

932
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:17,736
Thanks, I will.

933
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:19,926
It's still a completely ridiculous idea.

934
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:20,560
I know.

935
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:23,579
Al right. And, you know, in the meantime,

936
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,668
if you're still riding
that bike around, come by the diner.

937
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:26,733
I'll put some air in your tires.

938
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:27,851
I don't need air in my tires.

939
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:29,702
You need air, and you need a light and

940
00:38:29,703 --> 00:38:31,354
a bell so people know you're coming.

941
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:32,967
What if I don't want people to know I'm coming?

942
00:38:32,968 --> 00:38:33,992
I'm putting on a bell!

943
00:38:33,993 --> 00:38:34,808
No, you're not!

944
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:36,316
What do you have against bells?

945
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:37,420
I don't like 'em.

946
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:40,363
Well, you don't have to
like them. They're a safety feature.

947
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:41,584
I want a horn!

948
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,881
Fine you want a horn,
I'll get you a horn. Are you happy?

949
00:38:43,882 --> 00:38:46,526
Jeez.

950
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:59,795
So, I don't know where
I'll be, but I think I know what I'll be.

951
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,711
- Really?
- A doctor.

952
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:03,507
Oh, Paris, that's great.

953
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,461
It's always been my dream, you know?

954
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:08,484
Last night when I was lying
in bed watching the ceiling spin�

955
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:10,359
I told you that last drink was a mistake.

956
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,778
It just became perfectly clear.
I've always wanted to be a doctor,

957
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:16,053
for as long as I remember. When I was a kid,

958
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,488
I used to cut the heads
off my dolls to see what was inside.

959
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,637
I'm guessing you didn't put that on your applications.

960
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:24,441
I let myself get swayed by
the promise of black-card corporate America,

961
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:26,614
but the truth is I want to be a physician --

962
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,621
always have, always will.

963
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:31,153
Well, I think it's a very noble profession.

964
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:33,740
Oh, yeah, definitely.
It's as close to being god as you can get.

965
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:37,083
- Hey, Paris. Hello, Rory.
- Hey, Doyle.

966
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:37,794
What are you doing here?

967
00:39:37,795 --> 00:39:38,621
I live here.

968
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:41,080
Uh, yeah, but we agreed
you'd be the one to move out.

969
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:42,569
About that -- I changed my mind.

970
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,158
It's inappropriate for my best friend

971
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,756
to be living alone with my ex-boyfriend.

972
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:47,774
I don't want to live alone with her. No offense, Rory.

973
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:48,370
None taken.

974
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:50,420
We can't all live together. We're broken up.

975
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,979
Actually I changed my mind about that, too.

976
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,085
What do you mean? What is he talking about?

977
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:55,060
I don't think he wants to break up.

978
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:57,106
That's right I don't. Oh, and by the way,

979
00:39:57,107 --> 00:39:58,107
I think you got into two more med schools --

980
00:39:58,108 --> 00:40:01,011
Washington University and Duke.

981
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:04,342
You know I never saw myself
living in St. Louis or North Carolina,

982
00:40:04,343 --> 00:40:05,805
but who knows? Maybe I'll end up there.

983
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:06,806
What are you talking about?

984
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:10,152
I love you, Paris Geller. You are the strongest,

985
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:12,312
most infuriating, most exciting woman

986
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:14,155
I have ever met in my entire life,

987
00:40:14,156 --> 00:40:16,620
and there is no way I'm gonna let you go.

988
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:17,423
You don't have a choice.

989
00:40:17,424 --> 00:40:19,590
Sure, I do. Just because
you don't want to base your decision

990
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:21,690
on me doesn't mean I can't base my decision on you.

991
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:22,637
That's absurd.

992
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:24,754
Anywhere you go, I'm going.

993
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,376
We're too young to do this!

994
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:29,302
Maybe you are, but I'm
older and a heck of a lot more mature.

995
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:38,603
So... you're saying that if I go to Alaska,

996
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:39,959
you're gonna move there, too?

997
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,070
Well, I've always wanted to go dogsledding.

998
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:45,920
That's ridiculous, with your low threshold for cold.

999
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:46,961
I'll wear warmer clothes.

1000
00:40:46,962 --> 00:40:48,240
You're not thinking clearly.

1001
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:50,447
I've never been clearer.

1002
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,262
Keep in mind I'm not going to look
for a school with good newspapers nearby.

1003
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:57,448
Keep in mind that the internet is taking
off and I can write freelance from anywhere.

1004
00:40:57,449 --> 00:40:59,990
So that's your plan --
to be a freelance journalist?

1005
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,172
No, my plan is to be with you.

1006
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:03,551
Why are you doing this?

1007
00:41:03,552 --> 00:41:05,195
Because I love you, okay?

1008
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,853
Well, I love you, too.

1009
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:09,360
- That was sweet.
- Shut up.
