1
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,331
- What about that one? 
- Hm, no.

2
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,380
- Why not? 
- Too pale.

3
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,024
- So what? 
- Pale means sickly.

4
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:09,898
- Or sunscreen. 
- Or Mad Cow Disease.

5
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,910
Pale does not mean Mad Cow Disease.

6
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:13,979
Have you ever had Mad Cow Disease?

7
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,267
Twice last week and my coloring was wonderful.

8
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,603
I need a great dance partner this year.

9
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:21,654
Someone strong, non-clutzy, with lots of stamina.

10
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,778
- How tall is that guy? 
- Mrs. Coulter�s about 6�2".

11
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:28,473
Four years in a row, I have come this close to winning.

12
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,369
Last year, I swear to God, I had it!

13
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:32,596
- I know the story. 
- It was hour twenty-three.

14
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:33,739
I know the story.

15
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:36,307
I�m dancing with Henry Ho-Ho McAphie the third.

16
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,993
How many people heard me say I know the story?

17
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:41,087
And Ho-Ho�s fading, so I�m trying to buck him up,

18
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:43,303
saying "Come on, Ho-Ho. Stay with me Ho-Ho,"

19
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,340
and then all of a sudden he starts yelling, "Stop calling me Ho-Ho, it�s making me hungry!"

20
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:47,922
Look, there goes Tommy Tune.

21
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:50,482
And out of nowhere, Kirk comes dancing by,

22
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,774
waving a McDonald�s hot apple pie in the air and of course

23
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:57,189
Ho-Ho lunges for the pie and drops my hand and that was it.

24
00:01:57,308 --> 00:02:00,886
Kirk wins, I�m out. I�m gonna get that Ho-Ho someday.

25
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:02,453
- I�ll help ya. 
- I wanna win.

26
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,035
- I know you do. 
- I need a partner.

27
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:05,593
You�ll get one. Keep looking.

28
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:08,659
- Out there. 
- But, wait...

29
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:10,134
Pancakes, right? Coming right up.

30
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:12,689
Breathe in deep, folks. Smells like fall.

31
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:14,368
- Get out, Taylor. 
- Why?

32
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,787
Just a code I live by.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,317
Oh... pffft... you.

34
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,780
Listen, I�d like to run a little something by you.

35
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:20,651
I�m busy, Taylor.

36
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:22,484
I was just thinking how nice it would be if you could set up

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,277
a little coffee stand at the marathon.

38
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:25,301
- Coffee stand. 
- Yes.

39
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,661
I mean, these people have to try and stay up for twenty-four hours.

40
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:30,841
What better to help you stay up than a cup of nice strong cup of coffee?

41
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:31,890
- What do you say? 
- Sure.

42
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,702
- Really? 
- For a buck a cup.

43
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,765
Luke, this marathon is a charitable event.

44
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:40,395
Taylor, we have been raising money to restore that stupid bridge for eight years.

45
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:42,494
We�re not raising money to restore the bridge.

46
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,799
- We�re not? 
- No, we have that money.

47
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,425
The Tennessee Williams lookalike contest last month put us right over the top.

48
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:50,468
Then what the hell is this dumb thing for?

49
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,055
- A tarp. 
- A what?

50
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,980
To cover the bridge.

51
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:55,485
This is a first, Taylor. I actually need to sit down.

52
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:59,058
Luke, you know as well as I do that if we start renovations now,

53
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:01,854
heading right into the snow and rainy part of the season,

54
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:05,822
then everything we do is gonna get ruined, and there we are � back at square one.

55
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,993
If we are gonna do this right, then we are going to need a tarp.

56
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,773
Taylor, you are asking me to donate free coffee to hundreds of people

57
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:14,123
so you can raise money to buy a tarp.

58
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:17,102
- How �bout fifty cents a cup? 
- How �bout I charge for cream?

59
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,595
You would kick Tiny Tim�s crutch out from under him, wouldn�t you?

60
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,919
If he asks for a free cup of coffee, gimpy�s going down.

61
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,176
Whoa � look at Taylor go.

62
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:30,584
I wonder who he�s dancing with.

63
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:29,872
This is amazing chicken, Mom. I mean it, really great.

64
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:31,321
Thank you, Lorelai.

65
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:33,364
It�s like super chicken.

66
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,411
I bet it could fly. Have you tried tossing it out the window?

67
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:39,262
- All right, what�s going on? 
- What? I like the chicken.

68
00:04:39,354 --> 00:04:41,086
Nobody likes the chicken that much, Lorelai.

69
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:42,509
- I�m in a good mood. 
- Why?

70
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,208
My God, it�s my ninth grade homecoming dance all over again.

71
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:46,852
- Homecoming dance? 
- In ninth grade,

72
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:49,243
I got asked to the homecoming dance and I didn�t think I would,

73
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:52,294
and I was in a really good mood, and Mom got so annoyed

74
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,897
that she made me go to my room.

75
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:54,763
Grandma?

76
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:57,215
She was sitting at the table giving all the peas voices.

77
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,341
With a little encouragement,

78
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,507
I could�ve been the Senor Wences of the vegetable set.

79
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:02,284
- Lorelai. 
- Okay, okay, okay.

80
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:03,574
It�ll come out soon enough.

81
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,113
Today, ladies and gentlemen, I found a dance partner.

82
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,366
- You did? 
- A good one.

83
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,917
What are you talking about, a dance partner? A dance partner for what?

84
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,652
Our town is having a dance marathon this weekend.

85
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:15,628
It lasts twenty-four hours and the last couple left standing gets a trophy.

86
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,861
A big trophy.

87
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:17,947
That sounds very nice.

88
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,309
All the proceeds go to charity.

89
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,034
Which is great � but did I mention the trophy?

90
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:22,709
- I believe you did. 
- �Cause it�s big.

91
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,260
Charitable events are wonderful things to take part in.

92
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:29,555
There�s nothing more rewarding than devoting yourself to making someone else�s life better.

93
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:32,945
And whose life isn�t better with a truly gigantic trophy around?

94
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:34,097
So who�d you get to dance with you?

95
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:35,879
- Stanley Appleman. 
- Who�s Stanley Appleman?

96
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:38,434
He�s brand new in town. He works over at the hardware store,

97
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,659
and the best part is, he used to be part of the touring company...

98
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,866
- of Riverdance. 
- Score!

99
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:46,764
I know! I�m completely jazzed.

100
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:49,391
How �bout you, Mr. Potato? I�m completely jazzed, too.

101
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,106
- What�s that? 
- I think that�s me.

102
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:54,548
Lorelai, I�ve told you a hundred times to turn that thing off

103
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,795
- when you come to dinner here. 
- I know, Mom. I�m sorry.

104
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:58,552
Can�t you let it go to voice mail?

105
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:01,562
See, I left Michel alone at the inn, and he�s dealing with the roofers.

106
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:02,903
I told him to call me if there was any trouble.

107
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:04,762
Is that true?

108
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:08,003
- I�m gonna let Mr. Potato field this one. 
- I thought so.

109
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:09,637
Hello? ... What?

110
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:12,930
Oh, no no, don�t tell me that...

111
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:16,441
Did you tell her how big the trophy is, because I am really not exaggerating here...

112
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:21,050
How did your wife get a picture of me? Stanley, that is crazy!

113
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:22,585
I don�t wanna sleep with you...

114
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:25,340
Did you tell her I don�t wanna sleep with you?

115
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:27,660
Put her on the phone. I�ll tell her I don�t wanna sleep with you...

116
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:30,149
Somebody has to tell her I don�t wanna sleep with you...

117
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:32,858
Why are you insulted all of a sudden? ... Stanley?

118
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:38,750
- Great. 
- What happened?

119
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:42,458
- Stanley bailed. 
- No! Why?

120
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,535
Apparently, Miss Patty showed his wife a picture of me,

121
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,425
and she thinks I look like Elizabeth Taylor,

122
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:49,386
which makes her Debbie Reynolds, and Stanley Eddie Fisher.

123
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:51,843
- That�s crazy. 
- Especially if you�ve seen Stanley.

124
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:54,654
He�s no Eddie Fisher, trust me. Fisher Stevens, maybe.

125
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:55,666
Can�t you talk to her?

126
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,231
Apparently, only at my own risk.

127
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,883
At least she thought you looked like Elizabeth Taylor. That was nice.

128
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:01,690
- I have no partner. 
- You�ll find another one.

129
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:03,109
Elizabeth Taylor always did.

130
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:04,665
There�s someone else out there, trust me.

131
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:05,817
I guess.

132
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,311
- Here. Have some more chicken. 
- Thanks, Mom.

133
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:11,453
And if you�d like, later on, you can make my asparagus talk.

134
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:12,837
Maybe next week.

135
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:15,842
- Okay, let�s talk about Saturday. 
- What about Saturday?

136
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:18,084
I think we need to work. The seventy-fifth anniversary issue

137
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,291
of the Franklin comes out next month and I want it to be amazing.

138
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:23,338
- I�ve got some great cover art lined up. 
- Old pictures, new pictures?

139
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,410
Collage style with kind of a sepia-toned finish to it. Very classy.

140
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,587
Okay, I like it. Time!

141
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:30,103
- See ya. 
- Bye.

142
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,308
So, what were we talking about?

143
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,627
Working Saturday on the seventy-fifth anniversary issue.

144
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:36,917
Thanks for asking.

145
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,000
But you guys already have some decent stuff planned out, right?

146
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,721
Madeline -- or may I call you Spicoli?

147
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:44,249
- If you have to. 
- This is the seventy-fifth anniversary issue.

148
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:48,403
There is only going to be one seventy-fifth anniversary issue ever, and it�s on our watch.

149
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,815
We screw this up and we basically mooned a piece of history.

150
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:52,858
Is that what you want? To B.A. history?

151
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,458
But I don�t understand. Last year was the seventy-fourth anniversary issue

152
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,974
- of the Franklin. 
- So?

153
00:07:57,066 --> 00:08:00,071
So there�s only gonna be one seventy-fourth anniversary issue ever

154
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,720
and we didn�t do anything special for it.

155
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:04,005
I think the cover was of a deep-fried Mars bar.

156
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:06,877
That�s because nobody cares about the seventy-fourth anniversary issue.

157
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:08,981
I bet the person who worked on it seventy-four years ago did.

158
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:09,984
We�re working Saturday!

159
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,180
"Why are we working Saturday, Paris?

160
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,962
What�s so special about the seventy-fifth issue, Paris?

161
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,327
Why does my head feel so light and yet not float away, Paris?"

162
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:19,794
What?

163
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,544
- What�s he doing here? 
- I bet he�s here to see you.

164
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:25,084
He hasn�t called me once. I haven�t seen or heard from him

165
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:26,788
since we had our date in Washington three months ago.

166
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,228
Maybe he wants to explain why.

167
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:30,031
He was supposed to go away and never come back.

168
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:31,802
I already wrote his name in my revenge notebook.

169
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:34,075
Paris, he knows you�re standing here talking about him.

170
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:35,883
- What does he want? 
- Go over there and find out.

171
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:41,935
What do you want?

172
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:43,840
I�m on break from school, I thought I�d come down and see you.

173
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:46,338
- But you never called. 
- I know.

174
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,796
- You lost my number? 
- Nope, I memorized your number.

175
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:51,188
- You didn�t wanna use my number? 
- I was starting classes.

176
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:52,796
In phone dialing? How�s it going?

177
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,690
Look, Paris, this year�s very important for me.

178
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,661
I thought the last thing I needed was a distraction.

179
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:58,304
I totally understand.

180
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,128
This year�s very important for me, too.

181
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:03,487
I�m focusing on getting into Harvard, and the last thing that I need is a distraction...

182
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:07,020
so, good move. You saved us both a lot of distractions.

183
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:09,483
Thank you, and good luck.

184
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,428
- I need my hand. 
- If I let go, how fast will you run away?

185
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:16,309
- 3.2 seconds. 
- I thought so.

186
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,166
- Hey Rory. 
- Hey Jamie.

187
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,603
- How�s Princeton? 
- It�s good. Crazy, but...

188
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:22,415
- Let go. 
- No.

189
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:23,415
- Yes. 
- Paris.

190
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:26,273
Look, you don�t have to be nice, you don�t have to tie up loose ends.

191
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:30,270
I get it, I�m a distraction. Now either pull a Boxing Helena, or give me back my hand.

192
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,330
Yes, talking to you would�ve been a distraction.

193
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,575
I know. I heard you already. My God, find a pirate to sit on, okay?

194
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:38,494
However, not talking to you has turned out to be impossible.

195
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,575
What?

196
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:42,799
I flunked a pop quiz in poli-sci because I couldn�t stop thinking about you.

197
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:44,481
Still want your hand back?

198
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:46,257
I�ve got another.

199
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,787
I�ve thought a lot about this, and...

200
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:50,352
apparently you�re a distraction that I�m supposed to have.

201
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,797
You didn�t have a bad time on the date?

202
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,226
- Are you busy right now? 
- Well...

203
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:55,351
- No, we�re done. She�s free. 
- Good.

204
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,144
Let�s go get some coffee.

205
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,774
- Bye Rory. 
- Bye Jamie.

206
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:02,672
- He took my books. 
- Go get �em back.

207
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,128
- Well? 
- Still ringing.

208
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,856
- He�s home. 
- How�d he sound?

209
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:15,345
- Homey. 
- Nice.

210
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:18,582
I know this is a stupid question, but why can�t you just talk to him?

211
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:22,078
Because yesterday he called to say that they were still looking for

212
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:25,023
a rehearsal space and that he�d call when he had more news.

213
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:26,979
So now I have to wait until he calls about the band �

214
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:29,513
and in between, I call and hang up on him. Pathetic.

215
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,843
Not so pathetic. I used to hang up on Dean all the time.

216
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:33,799
- You did? 
- I remember that.

217
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,319
- When did you hang up on me? 
- Right when we first met.

218
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,988
- You should�ve just said something. 
- I couldn�t do that.

219
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:38,668
Why not?

220
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:41,382
Because then you would�ve known that I was calling and therefore that I liked you.

221
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:44,141
- Yes, but I liked you, too. 
- I know that now.

222
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:46,816
- You could�ve known that then. 
- Dean, please. This is a girl thing.

223
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:49,238
Okay. Tell me when I�m supposed to pay attention again.

224
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,684
I�m gonna love him forever and he�s never gonna know it.

225
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:52,882
- He would if you coughed. 
- Dean.

226
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,293
- Sorry. 
- At least he�s at home and not out with a girl.

227
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:57,737
- Very true. 
- He could be home with a girl.

228
00:10:57,854 --> 00:11:00,040
- Dean. 
- Sitting here, staring at my pizza.

229
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:02,519
- You think he was at home with a girl? 
- No, no, I don�t.

230
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:03,845
- I�m gonna call again. 
- Good idea,

231
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:05,728
and pay attention to the background noise this time.

232
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,527
- Cool, pizza. 
- Shh.

233
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:09,468
She�s calling Dave to see if she can hear a girl in the background.

234
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,018
I voted that she actually say something.

235
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,733
You�re a boy, you know nothing about this.

236
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,739
- What�d you hear? 
- Quadrophenia.

237
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,287
Classy, but not date-like.

238
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:18,735
- You think? 
- Definitely.

239
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:21,684
What if he met a girl who�s a major Who fan?

240
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,441
- What? 
- Why are you causing trouble?

241
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:25,217
- Rory, can I talk to you in the kitchen? 
- Oh, sure.

242
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,359
Be good.

243
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:33,932
Go ahead.

244
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,446
Okay, so, what�s on your mind?

245
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:44,998
I think I figured out who can be my dance partner for the marathon.

246
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:46,021
Great! Who?

247
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,777
- Bye. 
- Come on!

248
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,508
- Forget it. 
- Just hear me out.

249
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:52,713
- First of all, you love me. 
- Not right at this moment, I don�t.

250
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:56,328
You know how much this contest means to me. You�d never fall asleep or chase a pie.

251
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:58,182
- I do not dance. 
- It�ll be fun.

252
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:00,374
We�ll get all dressed up, and you�re light...

253
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:02,063
- easy to hold up when you get tired. 
- Mom.

254
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,136
Plus, we got the whole mother/daughter gimmick going for us.

255
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,913
- The crowd�ll eat that up. 
- I cannot dance with you.

256
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:08,934
- Why not? 
- Because this is Dean�s first marathon.

257
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:12,063
We were gonna go and watch and hang out, he�s totally looking forward to it.

258
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:15,334
I told him about how Andrew gets in a fight with his date in the first fifteen minutes

259
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:18,774
and storms off the floor. I told him about Taylor getting punch-drunk

260
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:22,062
at hour fifteen and telling stories about how he always wanted to be a magician.

261
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,235
- Rory, please. 
- And ooh...

262
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:26,568
I told him about how when Kirk wins, he likes to take his victory lap around the floor

263
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,543
to the theme from Rocky. I was gonna show him all those things,

264
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,423
and I was gonna show them to him sitting down.

265
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:33,628
He can still come, and he can still see all those things,

266
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:36,881
except if you dance, maybe that victory lap will be you and me instead of Kirk.

267
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:40,071
Okay, I�ll tell you what.

268
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:43,051
I was supposed to work on the Franklin this weekend with Paris.

269
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:43,722
But?

270
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:46,036
I will ask her if we can reschedule.

271
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:47,956
If she says yes, then I will dance with you.

272
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,764
- Oh, I love ya! 
- You should sell cars.

273
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:51,976
I should, shouldn�t I?

274
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,659
Hello, big fancy trophy.

275
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,327
Take note of its form before treated.

276
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,714
Make sure that your notes are completely legible since you will be turning them in with your result.

277
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,058
- Miss Gellar, hello. 
- Sorry I�m late, Mrs. Savitt.

278
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:10,757
- Is everything okay? 
- Yes. I overslept.

279
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,819
- You�re kidding. 
- No, it won�t happen again.

280
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,519
Well, good.

281
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,489
Okay, everyone, let�s get to work.

282
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,798
Paris, hi. Listen, I need to ask you something.

283
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:22,560
Shoot.

284
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:25,105
There�s this big event that�s happening in my town...

285
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:26,324
- Pig race? 
- Dance marathon.

286
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:28,039
- I was close. 
- It�s on Saturday,

287
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:31,044
and it�s a twenty-four hour thing and my mother really wants to win,

288
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:34,015
and her partner bailed on her and, long story short,

289
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,577
I was wondering if there was anyway we could move this Saturday�s Franklin thing to next Saturday.

290
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,128
Okay.

291
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,046
- What did she say? 
- I don�t know.

292
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,463
- What did you say? 
- I said yes.

293
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:47,318
- She said yes. 
- She said yes.

294
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,019
- Are you free on Saturday? 
- No.

295
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,328
What about you? Come on � speak.

296
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:54,761
Louise, I got two over here!

297
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,921
- So, we�re done, right? 
- You had a good time yesterday.

298
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:59,119
What was yesterday?

299
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:01,158
Yesterday was the day that you were all freaked out

300
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:04,485
about the seventy-fifth anniversary issue of the Franklin and today�s the day you�re not.

301
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:08,090
Rory, just because I agreed to postpone a newspaper session does in no way imply...

302
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:09,923
- You can�t even stop smiling. 
- I can, too.

303
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:11,244
- Tell me. 
- Okay.

304
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:15,792
We went for coffee, and he talked about how he had a great time on our date,

305
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:20,241
and how he finds me fascinating, and how he thought about me all the time.

306
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:22,289
Okay, there, happy?

307
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:23,620
Wow, he likes you.

308
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,751
- I left an impression. 
- You sure did.

309
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:27,885
I still don�t understand why he�d wanna date me.

310
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:31,326
He�s surrounded by college girls all day long who must be prettier than I am,

311
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,001
and more experienced than I am.

312
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,589
I mean, I�m sure they�re all idiots, but usually that�s the last thing a guy thinks

313
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,509
about when he�s looking for a date for the big game.

314
00:14:38,622 --> 00:14:40,767
- Jamie must be special. 
- Or Ted Bundy.

315
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:42,837
Absolutely. It�s either one or the other.

316
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,041
- Hey. Can you do me a favor? 
- Okay.

317
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:49,180
Don�t say anything to Madeline or Louise about this.

318
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:50,506
- About Jamie? 
- Yeah.

319
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,453
- But they�re your best friends. 
- Theoretically, yes,

320
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,325
but the second I mention a guy they�re gonna both start singing the theme

321
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:58,132
from the Trojan Man commercial, and I just can�t take that, okay?

322
00:14:58,217 --> 00:14:59,821
No one knows until you give the word.

323
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:00,624
Thanks.

324
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,064
I have to say, for a couple of modern girls,

325
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,066
we have time-warped with the best of �em.

326
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:10,072
- How ya doing there, champ? 
- Early.

327
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,426
- Yes, it�s a tad early. 
- No sun.

328
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,845
Well, he�s not up yet.

329
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,473
I can�t even open my eyes.

330
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,096
That�s okay, there�s nothing to see.

331
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:21,229
Kirk�s in a Speedo, Taylor�s in a skirt, Al�s in assless chaps.

332
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,687
Oh my God, stop.

333
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:24,587
I�m never gonna be able to close my eyes again.

334
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,416
- Morning Babette. 
- Oh, morning sugar.

335
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,449
- You guys look terrific. 
- Thank you.

336
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:30,912
Babette, can I lay down on the table while Mom signs in?

337
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,488
Not an early bird, huh?

338
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:34,346
I need to get some coffee in her and we�ll be fine.

339
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:38,105
Kirk, however, is gonna be crying like a little teeny girl.

340
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,524
So what else is new?

341
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:43,379
Okay, now you two go get your physicals, bring your release forms inside,

342
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,116
- and they�ll get you a number. 
- Thanks.

343
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,068
Come on, Snoozy.

344
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:51,074
Hey, wait up!

345
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:53,446
Oh, wow, look at you!

346
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:55,248
- Is it fabulous? 
- It is fabulous.

347
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:57,988
Wait �til you see Jackson�s suit. It makes me want to ration sugar.

348
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,210
- Where is Jackson? 
- Oh, we already had our checkups,

349
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:02,949
so he�s going to sign us in and scope out a good spot on the floor.

350
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:05,642
Oh, it�s so cool to be married. You have your own spot-scoper.

351
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:07,778
- I�m gonna go say hi to Lane. 
- Okay, hon, hurry back.

352
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,759
Remember, the sooner we get inspected, the sooner we get coffee.

353
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:10,865
Yeah, coffee.

354
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:12,416
Okay, I have a problem.

355
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,925
Sookie, it�s five-thirty in the morning. How can you already have a problem?

356
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,667
- Because I�m a multi-tasker. 
- Hit me.

357
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:18,566
Last night, I made coq au vin for dinner,

358
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:21,367
- so of course the subject of children came up. 
- Of course.

359
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:25,673
All of a sudden, completely out of the blue, Jackson announces he wants four in four.

360
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:27,128
- He wants what? 
- Four in four.

361
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:29,999
- Four kids in four years. 
- Good Lord!

362
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,111
I know!

363
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,159
Who�s he gonna have these kids with?

364
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,535
- Me, apparently. 
- What did you say?

365
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,962
See, here�s where the problem comes in.

366
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,673
- What? 
- I think I said yes.

367
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,942
How is that possible?

368
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:43,712
I was totally shocked when he announced it and I sort of said,

369
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:47,825
"O...kay" and... but I think he took it as, "Okay!"

370
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:49,943
So, apparently, now I have to get busy.

371
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:52,421
- Do you want four in four? 
- No.

372
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:55,125
But, I mean, I want kids. You know I want kids.

373
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:57,198
- I know you want kids. 
- But I thought maybe one.

374
00:16:57,388 --> 00:17:00,035
Two if the first one is really quiet.

375
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:01,766
Honey, you have to tell Jackson that.

376
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:02,637
I can�t.

377
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,957
Sookie, this is not like the fruit bowl his mother gave you.

378
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,316
You can�t stick four kids in the attic and just pull them out at Christmas.

379
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,641
I know, but Jackson and I have never had a real fight.

380
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:13,411
We�re still newlyweds. We still sneak out of bed in the morning to brush our teeth,

381
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,492
then get back in bed and pretend we just woke up smelling like that.

382
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:19,093
You don�t have much of a marriage if you can�t talk about the important things.

383
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,082
I know.

384
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:22,238
Do you think I�m crazy to not want four in four?

385
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,936
Four kids is a lot, and four years without a cocktail...

386
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:26,580
Wow, hadn�t thought of that.

387
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,623
Glad to shed some much-needed perspective on the situation.

388
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:29,897
We�ll take care of this today.

389
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,367
Are you sure you don�t need some help?

390
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:36,575
Yeah, it�s okay. I finally got a really good footing.

391
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,878
-What is that stuff? 
- Eggless egg salad.

392
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:42,063
Though this year my mom added food coloring to make the egg-like product look more eggy.

393
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:42,785
Smart.

394
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:44,981
And every sandwich comes with your own personal pamphlet

395
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:47,772
"Dancing for the Devil," an illustrated look at the effect of dancing

396
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,719
on your chances of spending all eternity in hell.

397
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:51,284
Boy, her flames are getting really good.

398
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,486
She just bought a new color printer. You can do a ton of stuff with it.

399
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:54,321
Cool.

400
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:56,887
Lane, get scooping! The minute air hits the bread, it starts to stale.

401
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,772
Okay, Mama.

402
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,308
I�m gonna stop by later and say hi.

403
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,095
- Please do. 
- Bye, Mrs. Kim.

404
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:02,843
- You have a pamphlet? 
- Yes, I do.

405
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:03,927
Take one to your mother.

406
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:05,489
Next.

407
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,940
- Oh, good, just in time. 
- Sorry.

408
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:11,301
Hi there. This is Rory Gilmore and I�m Lorelai Gilmore.

409
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:14,024
- Lorelai Gilmore? 
- Yeah, L � o � r ...

410
00:18:14,116 --> 00:18:16,620
You don�t look like you�ve recently suffered a face-altering car crash.

411
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,540
Excuse me?

412
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:21,643
You�re also supposed to have buck teeth, a club foot, and alopecia.

413
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:23,926
Oh. I�m sorry, who told you this?

414
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,797
- My husband. 
- Your husband?

415
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,930
Well, who�s... Stanley Appleman.

416
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,429
Your husband is Stanley Appleman.

417
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,121
Okay, well, it�s very nice to meet you.

418
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:37,885
Stanley�s said the nicest things about you.

419
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:42,991
In the one tiny short conversation we had, you know, standing way far apart.

420
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,000
You know, too far to touch, but close enough to hear all the wonderful things he said

421
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:50,251
about his adorable, sweet-tempered, lovable...

422
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:53,221
can we have someone else do our physical?

423
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:57,538
Any couple without a number will be disqualified.

424
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,292
All couples must be touching at all times.

425
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,990
All couples must remain moving at all times.

426
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:08,268
The only time you may stop moving or stop touching is when you hear this horn.

427
00:19:09,308 --> 00:19:11,547
That sound means you have ten minutes.

428
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:14,045
Ten minutes to get a drink, to eat a snack, take a rest,

429
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:16,872
or whatever it is you can do in ten minutes.

430
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:19,175
And in addition to the ten-minute rest periods,

431
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:23,655
every person participating has been issued a yellow emergency card.

432
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:28,136
In case of emergency, a contestant may hold up the card

433
00:19:28,197 --> 00:19:30,158
and leave the floor for ten minutes.

434
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:35,055
If your partner remains on the floor and moving the entire time,

435
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:40,472
then the owner of the yellow card may rejoin them and the contest.

436
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:42,868
First aid is available in Miss Patty�s.

437
00:19:42,985 --> 00:19:46,359
Please, remember, that if you feel yourself getting lightheaded

438
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:50,527
or having shooting pains or any other stroke-like symptoms,

439
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,586
please move off to the side

440
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:55,387
so that your collapse will not get in the way of the other dancers.

441
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:58,402
All right, people, lace your shoes,

442
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,913
pin those curls, because we only have three minutes left until we start.

443
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:05,985
I believe three minutes is plenty of time for some coffee.

444
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,700
Yes, coffee, please.

445
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:09,313
Hey, we�re dying, load us up.

446
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:11,234
- It isn�t ready yet. 
- What?

447
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,314
Mommy.

448
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,251
What do you mean it�s not ready? It�s six in the morning.

449
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:15,725
Nothing says coffee like six in the morning.

450
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:21,321
You did not get this from me.

451
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,754
Then who do we send our kisses of gratitude to?

452
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,715
The eternal question asked yet again.

453
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,363
Thanks Luke. Strong.

454
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:28,832
Yeah? Hello.

455
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,988
All right, folks. Everybody on the floor.

456
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,851
We�re two minutes away. I repeat, everybody on the floor,

457
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:35,545
we are two minutes away.

458
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,774
Lorelai.

459
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,140
- Kirk. 
- Good luck to you.

460
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:42,970
And to you.

461
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:46,852
He�s going down.

462
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:48,479
- I hate to bring this up. 
- What?

463
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:50,584
Kirk has very little in his life.

464
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:54,239
He has no career, no girlfriend, no pet, no car.

465
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:56,978
He lives with his mother, she won't even let him have his own key.

466
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:01,894
The only thing he does have in his whole lonely pathetic existence is this marathon.

467
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:07,024
If we win, if we take him down, if we take away that last little piece of dignity,

468
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:08,908
then we leave him with nothing.

469
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:10,998
I wonder if he'll cry.

470
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:13,687
My mother, the Howard Roark of Stars Hollow.

471
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:15,688
All right, everybody, grab your partners,

472
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,727
make sure your numbers are securely fastened,

473
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,266
and let the countdown begin!

474
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:23,322
Ten, nine, eight,

475
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,134
seven, six, five,

476
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,964
four, three, two, one!

477
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:33,451
It�s showtime!

478
00:22:37,076 --> 00:22:38,854
- I�m done, let�s go. 
- Okay.

479
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:02,114
Hey Kirk, relax. Dancing�s supposed to be fun.

480
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,501
You know what will be fun, Lorelai?

481
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:07,762
Jogging around your prostrate body with that shiny temple

482
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:10,373
of silver importance hoisted in the air for all to see.

483
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:11,863
That will be fun.

484
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:16,676
Do you think serious Kirk is more disturbing than non-serious Kirk?

485
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,524
Actually, I think they�re both about the same.

486
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:19,806
- Come on. 
- What?

487
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:20,815
Follow me.

488
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,131
- Wow, you guys look great. 
- Hey, you came.

489
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,965
- Hey, you�re standing. 
- Hey, we had coffee.

490
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:27,834
I can tell. So, how�s it going?

491
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:31,120
It�s been pretty quiet so far. However, I do believe...

492
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:33,354
You went out with Liam Neeson! Are you kidding me?

493
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:34,418
Right on time!

494
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:37,586
Why would you ever tell me that you went out with Liam Neeson?

495
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:38,535
Why would you do that?

496
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:40,158
Because I was trying to be honest.

497
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:42,755
I don't believe that A, you actually went out with Liam Neeson,

498
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:45,135
and B, that you would choose to tell me now at this moment

499
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:46,666
that you went out with Liam Neeson!

500
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:47,756
- Andrew! 
- No!

501
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:50,010
- Andrew! 
- I can�t stand Liam Neeson!

502
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:52,836
- See, fun! 
- And no one�s even thrown up yet.

503
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,310
Okay, well...

504
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:56,810
I�m just gonna go sit over there and watch for awhile.

505
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,421
- Maybe I�ll get lucky. 
- Great.

506
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:02,088
That�s sweet. Spectator Ken.

507
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:03,465
Just keep dancing, you.

508
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,257
Flip all you want, pal. This ain�t the Olympics.

509
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:13,337
It�s who�s left standing at the end that matters, not how fancy you are getting there.

510
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:16,303
- Let me flip you. 
- No way.

511
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:17,404
- Come on! 
- You are not flipping me.

512
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:18,504
- Fine. 
- Fine.

513
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:21,812
- You flip me. 
- No need, you�ve already flipped.

514
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,190
- One cartwheel. 
- Silence.

515
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,088
Unauthorized persons on the dance floor.

516
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,480
Unauthorized persons on the dance floor.

517
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:34,725
Security! Security! Security!

518
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:42,119
Look who�s suddenly interested in dance.

519
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:44,311
Yeah, he�s a regular Martha Graham.

520
00:25:09,453 --> 00:25:11,341
Kirk.

521
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,930
How much longer?

522
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,996
Oh, chin up soldier. We should be getting a break pretty soon.

523
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,975
I hope so.

524
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,308
- Oh good, there she is. 
- Jackson, please.

525
00:25:29,718 --> 00:25:31,761
- Hey guys. 
- Hey to you, too.

526
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:33,507
Listen, I wanted to ask you, what do you think of my hair?

527
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:34,649
- What? 
- My hair.

528
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:35,776
How�s it look to you?

529
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,439
- Any opinion? 
- It looks fine.

530
00:25:37,557 --> 00:25:38,729
Jackson, you�re overacting.

531
00:25:39,022 --> 00:25:41,397
You think? How �bout you, Lorelai? You think I�m overreacting?

532
00:25:41,602 --> 00:25:42,523
Jackson, what?

533
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:46,088
- Oh my God. 
- What, what?

534
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:48,161
- The runaround. 
- The runaround?

535
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:49,513
That does not sound good.

536
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,720
I�m sorry, baby. I�m so, so sorry.

537
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:58,181
Ladies and Gentlemen, on your marks... get set... and go!

538
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:05,351
Round and round they go, but when the song stops, nobody knows!

539
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:10,732
But the last five couples that finish behind the red line are automatically out,

540
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,862
so hold onto your partner and move, move, move!

541
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:18,749
You�re getting too much pleasure out of this, Taylor.

542
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:25,195
Hey Lorelai, just wondering, how�s my running? Got an opinion on that?

543
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,137
Jackson, what�s going on?

544
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,998
Nothing. He�s mad at me and he�s taking it out on you.

545
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:31,192
Oh, I�m not mad.

546
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:34,551
I just didn�t realize that when I married Sookie, I also married you.

547
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,018
I didn�t realize I was a Mormon, my mistake.

548
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:41,499
I need to interject for one second to tell you that I hate you!

549
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:42,334
Thanks, honey.

550
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:44,044
Quit trying to drag Lorelai into this.

551
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:45,068
Fine, I will.

552
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:49,415
Jackson, wait! Yellow cards, right here!

553
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,304
I�ve got �em for the both of us. We�ll be right back!

554
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,340
One of you is supposed to stay here. Hey!

555
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:57,204
- I think I�m going to die. 
- Me first.

556
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:59,799
- How much longer? 
- I don�t know.

557
00:26:59,892 --> 00:27:02,293
I just know that every year I block this part out.

558
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:04,736
From now on I�m going to remind you of it.

559
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:07,143
- Kirk, what are you doing? 
- I�m drafting you.

560
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:09,144
- Well, stop it! 
- You can�t tell me where to run!

561
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:11,074
Kirk, I swear to God, don�t make me come back there!

562
00:27:11,244 --> 00:27:13,880
Ten minute break everyone, ten minute break.

563
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:15,000
Well run.

564
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,429
Ten minute break, everyone. Ten minute break.

565
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,116
What are you doing?

566
00:27:24,218 --> 00:27:26,113
I�m trying to kick you but I can�t reach.

567
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,792
I would help you but I can�t move.

568
00:27:27,894 --> 00:27:29,744
- Can I owe you one? 
- Yeah, no problem.

569
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:33,133
Okay, okay, heart returning to normal.

570
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:36,011
I have to go find Jackson and Sookie.

571
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:37,664
I�ll get us a couple of sandwiches.

572
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:38,996
Good idea.

573
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:44,592
- This is fun, huh? 
- Big fun.

574
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,309
- So, not dancing? 
- Nope.

575
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:00,454
- Why not? Too cool? 
- Go away, Jess.

576
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:02,236
No one asked for a Tony Manero wannabe to drop by.

577
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,752
Hey, I�m just here for the food.

578
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:05,288
Here, enjoy, buh-bye.

579
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:07,870
I noticed Rory�s not dancing with Dean.

580
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:09,108
Nothing gets past you, does it.

581
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,265
How come? Trouble in paradise?

582
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:12,590
Rory�s dancing with her mother. Nothing�s wrong with her and Dean,

583
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:14,504
and you�re blocking my sandwiches from the rest of the room.

584
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:17,090
I know. They�re erecting a statue to me in the park next week.

585
00:28:17,235 --> 00:28:18,821
- Who are you? 
- Jess...

586
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:21,141
ma�am.

587
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,123
Scoop more.

588
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:27,910
The sandwiches are for the dancers.

589
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:29,431
I�m dancing on the inside.

590
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,023
- What are you doing here? 
- I live here.

591
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:34,008
You have nothing better to do than to sit around inside a gymnasium all day

592
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:36,277
- staring at a dance marathon? 
- I don�t know.

593
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:39,078
Do you have nothing better to do than sit inside a gymnasium all day

594
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,256
staring at a dance marathon?

595
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:42,621
I wouldn�t direct any sort of comment toward me if I were you.

596
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,101
I�m just trying to support my town.

597
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:45,309
Good, then go back to New York.

598
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:47,255
Zing. I�ve been snapped.

599
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:49,650
You think you�re bugging me sitting in front of me staring like that?

600
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:51,858
You think you�re bugging me dancing in front of me staring like that?

601
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:52,913
I�m not staring at you.

602
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:54,079
Then how do you know I�m staring at you?

603
00:28:54,197 --> 00:28:56,839
I am dancing. I cannot control where my glance goes.

604
00:28:56,957 --> 00:28:59,984
And the few moments that I can control it, my glance goes to Dean, not to you.

605
00:29:00,132 --> 00:29:01,893
So you can�t control when you look at me,

606
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:03,384
but you have to force yourself to look at him?

607
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,226
Sorry, man. That�s cold.

608
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:07,270
- My former comment still stands. 
- Go home.

609
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:09,097
- No, thanks. 
- Then get out of my way.

610
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,652
Didn�t realize I was in your way. There you go. It�s all yours. God help you.

611
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,043
Where did you go? I�ve been sitting out there for twenty minutes.

612
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:17,327
- The break�s only for ten. 
- It�s just a saying.

613
00:29:17,526 --> 00:29:19,466
- I came to get food. 
- Good, I�m starved.

614
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,624
The food is for the dancers.

615
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,938
Who are you, Bobby Brady? Get a life.

616
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,139
Rory�s feeling a little territorial today.

617
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:26,937
Whatever. God, what is this thing?

618
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,842
Rory, get your stuff and let�s go.

619
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:39,133
That was good. Now say �then get in there and make me my supper.�

620
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:40,060
I got �em.

621
00:29:41,969 --> 00:29:42,881
Come on.

622
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:44,858
See you in there.

623
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,322
I�m gonna get a soda.

624
00:29:52,846 --> 00:29:54,459
- Have you seen Sookie and Jackson? 
- Nope.

625
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:55,750
I�ve looked everywhere for them.

626
00:29:55,902 --> 00:29:58,914
Have you tried the insane asylum where everybody in this room is supposed to be?

627
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:00,962
Okay, I need to say something here.

628
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,452
I�ve been looking all over for you.

629
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,998
I wish you would just drop this.

630
00:30:04,141 --> 00:30:06,328
Contrary to your belief, there are some things in life

631
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,406
that you do not have the right to have an opinion on.

632
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:09,072
What?

633
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,658
And the rate at which I have kids and the amount of kids I wish to have

634
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:14,444
- falls directly under that category. 
- Sookie, what did you tell him?

635
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:17,909
Okay, you see, once again, my communication skills � not so good.

636
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:20,095
Jackson, I didn�t mean to get involved in any of this.

637
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:22,774
No? Telling Sookie that she needs to immediately inform me

638
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:25,390
- that four in four is crazy? 
- Sookie.

639
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,832
- Yeah, it did come out something like that. 
- Aw man.

640
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:29,574
- What�s four in four? 
- Four kids in four years.

641
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:30,915
That is crazy.

642
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:34,187
Oh good, yes, let�s open this up to even more discussion.

643
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,276
One kid in four years is crazy. 

644
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,411
Sorry, go ahead, drop another sucker in this mess.

645
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:41,222
Okay, raise your hand if you�re not helping.

646
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:43,926
Does anyone here understand that a man has a right

647
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,757
not to have his personal life debated in a public forum?

648
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:49,102
- I am not Winona Ryder. 
- I know that.

649
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:51,064
I�m sorry, Jackson, I didn�t mean...

650
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:53,936
My child-bearing arrangements are between me and Sookie.

651
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,071
And the Lord. Still not helping?

652
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:57,991
Jackson, just please calm down.

653
00:30:58,093 --> 00:31:00,215
I will calm down. I�ll calm down at home.

654
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:02,380
- But what about the contest? 
- To hell with the contest!

655
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:06,399
I'm quitting the contest. That is, if it's okay with Lorelai, or Luke,

656
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:09,384
or that strange man in the corner who I've never met.

657
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:13,644
Excuse me, strange man in the corner? Is it okay if I quit this contest?

658
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:17,501
I�m so sorry. I got tongue-tied and things just started coming out

659
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:18,872
- and I couldn�t stop them and... 
- Go.

660
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:20,438
Jackson, honey, wait!

661
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,045
They�re gonna make great parents.

662
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:24,494
All dancers back on the dance floor.

663
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:26,517
All dancers back on the dance floor.

664
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:29,159
- Mom. 
- Let�s go.

665
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:50,930
And then I�d say �what is this in your ear�

666
00:31:51,073 --> 00:31:54,535
and I�d pull out a bright shiny penny

667
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:58,417
and then whole room would laugh and clap.

668
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:00,771
Yeah, I�m sure they did, Taylor.

669
00:32:00,884 --> 00:32:01,843
Yeah.

670
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:04,873
Have you ever levitated a rottweiler?

671
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:05,574
No.

672
00:32:06,015 --> 00:32:07,428
Not easy.

673
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:11,693
But in a cape with a wand

674
00:32:11,836 --> 00:32:15,472
and a shiny black top hat...

675
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:21,989
What are you doing?

676
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:23,224
I was just...

677
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:25,031
You tried to take my megaphone.

678
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,428
No, I just didn�t want you to drop it.

679
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,198
No one touches my megaphone. No one.

680
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,592
- What do you mean... 
- Guards!

681
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,851
- no one touches your megaphone? 
- Guards!

682
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:35,043
How�s that... take that! 

683
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,295
Tell me a joke.

684
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,189
Knock knock.

685
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:43,910
That was a good one.

686
00:32:46,224 --> 00:32:46,879
You okay?

687
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:47,873
- Oh no! 
- What?

688
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:49,347
- My heel broke. 
- What?

689
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:53,766
My heel just broke off. Damn, these are brand new shoes, too.

690
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:55,160
They were made in 1943.

691
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,660
I just bought them Tuesday.

692
00:32:56,761 --> 00:32:58,565
I told you not to wear vintage shoes.

693
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:01,514
But the lady at the store said that they hadn�t been worn a lot.

694
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:04,714
Yeah, but not a lot in sixty years is still a lot.

695
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:07,499
I gotta fix �em. I�ll use my emergency card. I�ll be right back.

696
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,967
No, stop. If you leave, there�s no way I�ll be able to stand up on my own.

697
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:12,317
- Ten minutes. 
- Nighty-night.

698
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:14,447
Fine, hold on.

699
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:15,983
Dean, come here! Dean!

700
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:18,907
What are you doing?

701
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:21,149
- Is everything okay? 
- Yeah, it�s great. Stand here.

702
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,255
Look, I�ll be back in ten minutes.

703
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:26,676
Do not let her stop or lay down, do you understand me?

704
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:28,493
- But I... 
- I need you, Dean.

705
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:31,464
- The team needs you. 
- What team?

706
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,729
Pick a team � it needs you. I�ll be right back.

707
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:38,314
I�m really sorry about this.

708
00:33:38,626 --> 00:33:40,131
Yeah, it�s okay.

709
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:41,339
Are you sure?

710
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:47,391
Yeah. Actually, it�s not bad at all.

711
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,939
I think that one�s a goner, Miss.

712
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:58,650
- Hey, my shoe broke. 
- What?

713
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,956
- I need you to fix it. 
- Do I look like a cobbler to you?

714
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:03,204
- If I say yes, will you fix my shoe? 
- Let me see it.

715
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:04,802
I only have ten minutes � please.

716
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:06,471
I think I have some glue back at the diner.

717
00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:08,175
Glue, yes � we love glue!

718
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:09,860
I wouldn�t say that too loudly if I were you.

719
00:34:09,993 --> 00:34:10,822
Thank you.

720
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:16,200
Hey. Are you guys out?

721
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:18,390
No, my shoe broke. Luke�s fixing it.

722
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:21,422
Oh, good. Listen, I just feel terrible about what happened.

723
00:34:21,523 --> 00:34:22,814
I know. How�s Jackson?

724
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:27,137
Oh, he�s fine. We went home, and he calmed down, and we talked.

725
00:34:27,392 --> 00:34:30,515
He totally understands and he�s open to anything I want.

726
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:31,412
That�s great.

727
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,495
- Now, tell me what I want. 
- No way.

728
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:34,766
But I�m not sure.

729
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:37,310
Then flip a coin �cause I am staying so far out of this.

730
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:39,148
- You�re my best friend. 
- Yes, I am,

731
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:41,709
and I can only remain your best friend as long as Jackson doesn�t kill me.

732
00:34:41,852 --> 00:34:44,058
- Lorelai... 
- Sookie, he�s a produce man.

733
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:47,355
They�ll never find the body, but the squash will be especially chatty that year.

734
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:48,605
Okay, fair enough.

735
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,887
Hey, take your time.

736
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,667
- That�s it. That�s all I have to say. 
- Thank you.

737
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:54,295
- Got it. 
- Good.

738
00:34:54,858 --> 00:34:56,609
I�m going home to figure out what I want.

739
00:34:56,905 --> 00:34:58,621
- Good luck. Call me tomorrow. 
- I will.

740
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,124
- So, how�s that situation going? 
- It�ll be okay.

741
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,907
Good.

742
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:08,037
Listen... I didn�t really mean all that stuff I said earlier.

743
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,224
- What stuff? 
- The kid stuff, you know.

744
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:12,385
- Oh, it�s no big deal.
- Yeah, I know, I just...

745
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:16,368
I�m not really as anti-kid as I might have come off.

746
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,800
- Drop another sucker in... 
- Okay, yes.

747
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:22,129
I don�t always have the patience for �em. They tend to be a little squishy,

748
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:25,103
- and that freaks me out a little.
- You don�t have to want kids, Luke.

749
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,185
Or like kids. It�s not for everybody.

750
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,991
I know, but... although I�m quite happy going an entire day

751
00:35:32,107 --> 00:35:34,314
without having to deal with somebody else�s bodily functions,

752
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:37,734
if I ever happen to meet the right person... well,

753
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:40,643
- it would be a discussion.
- A discussion.

754
00:35:40,782 --> 00:35:42,912
Yes. Probably a short discussion, but still.

755
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:44,423
Here, hold this.

756
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:48,246
So what about you � you ever think about having another kid?

757
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,835
I don�t know how much fun it would be

758
00:35:49,932 --> 00:35:51,586
without biology finals and headgear...

759
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,062
but sure, if I ever happen to meet the right person,

760
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:57,173
another kid might be nice.

761
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:03,844
- Your shoe�ll be ready in a minute. 
- Thank you.

762
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,415
One sandwich please.

763
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,390
What are you doing here?

764
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:34,504
Well, you mentioned this thing last time we talked

765
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:37,935
and it sounded very Blue Velvet so I figured I would come by and check it out.

766
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:38,907
What do you think?

767
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:40,848
- I think you held back. 
- Yeah, well...

768
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:43,301
Anyhow, I hadn�t seen you in awhile, and I thought I�d come down

769
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,140
and maybe we could figure something out on this band issue.

770
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,570
Sure, we could do that.

771
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:47,970
Plus, I missed you.

772
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:50,049
You did? You missed me?

773
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:51,959
Yeah. Did you miss me?

774
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:54,725
Yeah, definitely. I definitely, definitely missed you.

775
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,932
Glad and relieved to hear it.

776
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:57,939
Who are you, what do you want?

777
00:36:58,037 --> 00:36:58,555
Mama.

778
00:36:58,641 --> 00:36:59,440
Do you know this boy? 

779
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:02,964
No, actually, I just heard a bunch of people talking outside

780
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:07,034
about the sandwiches and I thought that I would come in and maybe try one.

781
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:07,997
I'm sorry, may I?

782
00:37:10,168 --> 00:37:10,951
Thank you.

783
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:18,222
- That's delicious.
- Really?

784
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:19,747
May I have another one for later please?

785
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:21,074
Yes, that's fine.

786
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:22,687
Take another one.

787
00:37:23,337 --> 00:37:25,656
Thank you. You know, my parents would love these sandwiches.

788
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,724
I wish I could bring �em by but unfortunately they're in private bible study right now.

789
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,752
Bible study?

790
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:31,734
- Say, how long are you serving? 
- Why?

791
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:34,996
I thought that if they got out in time I could bring �em on over.

792
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,657
Well, the bread is only good for another twenty minutes,

793
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,778
after that there's no point. You chip a tooth.

794
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:42,716
Okay. So if I can get my parents back here in twenty minutes,

795
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,161
then you'll still be serving, but in thirty you're done?

796
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:46,384
- That's right. 
- Great.

797
00:37:46,537 --> 00:37:48,816
So if for some reason I'm not back here in twenty minutes,

798
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,771
that means that I'm gonna be over there, on the church steps,

799
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:53,756
waiting for my parents to get out so that I can tell them

800
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:56,240
about the great sandwiches that they missed. Okay?

801
00:37:56,814 --> 00:37:59,815
Okay, great. Thanks a lot and I hope to see you soon.

802
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:04,018
I hope he comes back. He seemed hungry.

803
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,491
- He�s still there. 
- What?

804
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:22,647
Jess. He�s still there. I can�t believe he�s still there.

805
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:24,228
- Just ignore him. 
- Yeah.

806
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:27,895
You know, this is a dance marathon.

807
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:31,120
You�re not supposed to come and sit and watch, you�re supposed to dance.

808
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:35,835
He�s just trying to bug me, sitting there right in front of me, staring.

809
00:38:36,654 --> 00:38:37,280
Jerk.

810
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:40,060
I�m bored.

811
00:38:41,315 --> 00:38:42,037
Okay.

812
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:44,428
There they go again!

813
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,029
God, I swear, why can�t they just get a room?

814
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:50,086
Or forget a room � get a park bench, or a doorway,

815
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,922
or even a strategically placed telephone pole would probably suffice.

816
00:38:53,752 --> 00:38:55,938
I mean, girls like Shane � what is it with them?

817
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:58,554
Don�t they see what they look like? I know they have mirrors.

818
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,691
- Hey, you talking about me? 
- No.

819
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:02,713
- I heard you mention Shane. 
- Shane isn�t you.

820
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:04,790
- Shane concerns me. 
- Shane concerns me, too...

821
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:07,147
- and all women, for that matter. 
- You got a problem here?

822
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:09,958
Nope. Just a little sick of seeing the two of you sitting there.

823
00:39:10,024 --> 00:39:12,502
If you�re not gonna participate, then why don�t you just leave?

824
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:13,936
That works for me. Let�s go.

825
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,139
- No. 
- Why not?

826
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:16,466
Because I�m not ready to go.

827
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:17,797
- Oh really? 
- Yes, really.

828
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:20,945
I�m gonna sit here as long as I like, and I�m gonna do whatever I like,

829
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:23,634
and if you don�t like it, then just ignore me and pay attention to your boyfriend.

830
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:25,672
Sorry, she can�t.

831
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:27,772
I�m not her boyfriend anymore.

832
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:28,836
What?

833
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,183
You know, I tried to ignore this.

834
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:34,428
I really did, but I don�t know what the hell I was thinking.

835
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:36,030
What are you talking about?

836
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,643
You don�t wanna be with me, Rory.

837
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:39,404
- Yes, I do. 
- Oh, please!

838
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:41,780
You�ve been into him since he got to town,

839
00:39:41,888 --> 00:39:43,674
and I have spent weeks � months, actually �

840
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,064
trying to convince myself that it wasn�t true, that everything was fine between us.

841
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:49,159
But now I know that I was an idiot.

842
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:51,826
You�re into him and he�s into you, and Shane,

843
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,837
who by the way, should be listening to this �cause it�s so damn obvious.

844
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,563
What�s obvious? What did I do?

845
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:58,145
Everyone can see, Rory!

846
00:39:58,734 --> 00:40:00,838
Everyone. And I�m tired,

847
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,700
but I�m over it, so go ahead, go.

848
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:07,719
Be together. There�s nothing standing in your way now, �cause I�m out.

849
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:18,611
I don�t see a yellow card. I don�t see a yellow card.

850
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:22,176
Excuse me, young lady... whose name I don�t remember right now...

851
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:25,380
No one listens to me.

852
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:26,741
I know, honey.

853
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,052
Dean�s a jerk.

854
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:50,500
Yelling at you like that, breaking up in front of everybody...

855
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,181
the guy�s a total jerk.

856
00:40:56,814 --> 00:40:57,863
No, he�s not.

857
00:40:58,908 --> 00:40:59,788
He�s right.

858
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:02,616
Everything he said.

859
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:08,058
All those things about you and me, all those things about me...

860
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:11,264
lying to him, and messing with his head.

861
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,435
He was right.

862
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:19,631
Well, wasn�t he?

863
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:24,592
Fine, he was right about me, then.

864
00:41:25,304 --> 00:41:26,287
Now go away.

865
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,366
He was right...

866
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:37,270
about...

867
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:40,952
all of it.

868
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,533
So, what now?

869
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,290
You�re definitely broken up with Dean?

870
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:54,084
Yeah, I�m definitely broken up with Dean.

871
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:57,224
Okay.

872
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,715
I have to go take care of something then.

873
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:29,574
They�re out! They�re out!

874
00:42:29,852 --> 00:42:31,546
We won! We won!

875
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:36,369
Oh, oh, oh. Taylor, wake up! It�s over.

876
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:37,685
Taylor, blow the horn.

877
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:40,061
... a quarter right out of your ear.

878
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,201
Taylor, the horn. Oh, for Pete�s Sake.

879
00:42:43,902 --> 00:42:46,564
Okay, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a winner!

880
00:42:46,758 --> 00:42:50,117
Wait, what are you doing? I�m here, I�m standing, I used my yellow card!

881
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:53,625
I win, I win! I win, I win, I win, I win!

882
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:56,016
You didn�t win! I�m still here! Patty, where�s Rory?

883
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:57,956
Oh, she ran off the floor a little while ago, honey.

884
00:42:58,049 --> 00:42:59,114
What? No!

885
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,160
Yes!

886
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,578
For the fifth year in a row, ladies and gentlemen,

887
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:06,005
the marathon winner is Donna Delain and Kirk!

888
00:43:09,012 --> 00:43:11,402
Rory, what happened? Where did you go?

889
00:43:12,765 --> 00:43:15,171
Oh, Rory, honey! Oh.
