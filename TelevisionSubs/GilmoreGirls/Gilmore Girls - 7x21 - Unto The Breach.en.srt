How did you get roped into bringing the cake to your parents' party?

17
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:49,059
I made the mistake of telling my mother how much Rory loves the chocolate-raspberry one from Weston�s.

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,335
-Ah! That�s my favorite.
-I know me too. So now I'm allowed to handle the cake.

19
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,735
Drycleaners, help me remember to pick up my dress from the dry cleaners.

20
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:55,635
Dry cleaners -- got it.

21
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:59,017
And heels -- I need to find a pair of heels that will not sink into the grass

22
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,000
at Yale. It�s all grass at Yale,

23
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:04,177
unless it�s cobblestones. Between the grass and the cobblestones, you can't barely walk around there.

24
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:07,101
So in fact don't help me remember heels. Help me remember wedges.

25
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:08,144
Dry cleaners and wedges.

26
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:10,114
Thank you so much for helping me.

27
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:15,074
I have so much on my mind between Rory�s graduation and Logan asking me for her hand.

28
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,592
Ooh, Champagne and ice -- I need to bring both of those to Yale.

29
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,145
Dry cleaners, wedges, champagne, and ice.

30
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:20,894
-Although everyone knows it�s a rhetorical question�

31
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:21,350
ha?

32
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:24,468
Logan asking my permission. Have you ever heard of anyone who says no?

33
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:25,460
Why did you want to say no?

34
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,857
No, he can ask her anything he wants.

35
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:30,375
I think she�s too young to get married but, oh

36
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:33,520
Plastic champagne flutes -- I can't forget those.

37
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,646
I know he asked me out of respect,

38
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:40,292
but I'll tell you what�s not respectful is asking for my permission and then making me wait.

39
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:44,233
Every time the phone rings, I think it�s gonna be her, telling me that it�s happened, but it�s not.

40
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:48,781
It�s just my mother calling with some boring party detail, like asking me about the ratio of devil to egg.

41
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:51,927
Ooh, that�s easy. It�s one part yolk and two parts mayonnaise. Oh my God

42
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,354
- you don't care at all, do you?
- No. - No.

43
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,231
Ooh I have to remember my beaded clutch.

44
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:59,684
Don't let me forget my beaded clutch.
Got it.

45
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:01,393
Hey, Sue. I'm here to pick up the cake.

46
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:03,220
Oh great. Thanks.

47
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:07,234
And then, on top of everything, there�s this whole Luke thing.

48
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:11,593
Oh, thank god. I have been waiting and waiting all morning.

49
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:15,024
I didn't think you were gonna say anything, and then I didn't think I should say anything. So

50
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,994
there is a Luke thing?

51
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:19,707
I don't know Sookie. I can't figure out what happened. I mean

52
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,991
clearly something came up when I sang that song.

53
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:22,799
Clearly.

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,638
But I don't know if it was a new, now feeling or the residue of an old feeling that came up

55
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,948
because of the drinks and the lyrics and the hat.

56
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,189
That was a deadly cocktail.

57
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:37,526
So that�s why I'm going to the diner today -- to see how I feel, sober
and without the lyrics of "I will always love you" streaming in front of me.

58
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:39,229
Gotcha. But just so you know

59
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,203
I think it was a new, now feeling. The way you were singing to him...

60
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,930
Sookie you weren't even there.
I know but I had enough people describe it to me.

61
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:45,856
Oh, no!

62
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:48,426
No we're just excited for the possibility of you and Luke.

63
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:50,657
Look I know everyone�s heart is in the right place, but

64
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:52,250
I need to figure out what I want.

65
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:52,941
Gotcha.

66
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:56,503
Seriously Sookie I need your help � keeping all these people off my back.

67
00:02:56,504 --> 00:02:57,522
Understood.

68
00:02:57,523 --> 00:03:01,697
But, for the future, the next time you want other people to stay out of your relationship�

69
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:03,445
Don't serenade your ex in front of the whole town?

70
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:05,247
You admit it was a serenade.

71
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:06,590
Sookie...
Sorry.

72
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:08,861
There you go.
Thanks.

73
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:10,935
All right, We can check the cake off our list.

74
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,490
What else do I need to remember?

75
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,021
Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically.

76
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:16,104
What?

77
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:19,797
Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically.

78
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:21,050
Huh?

79
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:22,720
It�s a mnemonic device.

80
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:26,257
Dress, wedges, champagne, ice, plastic flutes, beaded clutch.

81
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:27,483
"Beaded clutch" is one word.

82
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:28,918
And panty hose.

83
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,860
Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically, Polly.

84
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:34,830
And tissues and my camera.

85
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:40,207
"Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically," Polly teased Chad.

86
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,883
Why would Polly tease Chad about preferring footballs?

87
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:45,036
I don't know. Maybe Polly prefers soccer balls.

88
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:46,079
That doesn't make any sense.

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,003
Well then stop adding stuff to the list.

90
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:43,989
Hiya.

91
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,498
It�s so great to see you.
Wow! This place looks totally different.

92
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:49,175
Well T.J. And I fixed it up.

93
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,610
You guys did a really great job.

94
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:54,865
Thanks we worked our butts off, but it came out really nice.
What�s gonna go here?

95
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,796
Nothing. T.J. Put those up.

96
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,448
Yeah didn't want to tempt fate, huh?

97
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,668
Well, you know, he means well. He also built this coat-rack lamp, and it works.

98
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,221
Nice.

99
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:10,460
So, what brings you here?
Well you know I want to get Rory a graduation gift,

100
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:13,446
and I just thought earrings might be the right thing you know.

101
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,213
Cool. I got a whole lot of them, take a look around.

102
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:20,769
So I heard about Lorelai�s karaoke serenade.

103
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,678
I wish I had been there.
It wasn't a serenade.

104
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,806
That�s not what I heard.

105
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:29,525
I was at Weston�s a couple of days ago, and half the town was talking about it.

106
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:32,109
Well half the town should get a hobby. What do you think about these?

107
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,614
Ah, those aren't Rory�s taste.

108
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:38,616
They're too trippy. She�s not trippy.

109
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:39,829
So, what have you done?

110
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,355
What do you mean, what have I done?

111
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:42,647
About the love serenade.

112
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:45,387
It wasn't a serenade, and I haven't

113
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:48,910
done anything. I've worked real hard to try to get that stupid song out of my head.

114
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,050
Aren't you gonna respond in some way?

115
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:55,957
Well there�s nothing to respond to. She drank a truckload of tequila, and she sang a sappy song.

116
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,681
Oh no. Time. Okay.

117
00:05:57,682 --> 00:06:02,848
"I will always love you" is not a sappy song. It�s classic Cyndi Lauper.

118
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:03,800
Whitney Houston.

119
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:09,333
It doesn't matter. The point is, she will always love you.

120
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,468
I heard the song.

121
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,531
She�s waiting for you to make a move.

122
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:16,275
Look if it had meant something, she would have come in, you know. What do you think of these?

123
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,363
The teardrops -- Rory will love those.

124
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:19,805
Good.

125
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,854
Look, all I'm saying

126
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:24,254
is, from everything I've heard and know,

127
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,342
Lorelai would like you to respond.

128
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:30,963
I mean Crazy Carrie was there, and she said Lorelai definitely gave you the love look.

129
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:34,148
I wouldn't trust information coming from a woman who wears a cardboard hat.

130
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:36,587
You got a box for those?
I certainly do.

131
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:39,953
You like that?
Yeah. Well, it�s nice.

132
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:43,879
It is. It would really match Lorelai�s eyes.

133
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,250
In fact, I was actually thinking of Lorelai when I made that.

134
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:49,559
Well, I wasn't thinking --

135
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,999
it�s a nice necklace, is all.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,627
It is. All right.

137
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:58,145
This is on me.
Oh, what? No, no. Come on.

138
00:06:58,146 --> 00:07:00,717
After everything you've done for me...
I'm not gonna not pay.

139
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:03,261
After everything�s T.J.�s put you through?

140
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,479
That�s very nice of you.

141
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,434
You know what? Maybe I will get this necklace as a backup for Rory.

142
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:12,057
Right.
yeah and she has blue eyes, right?

143
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,378
Yes, she does.

144
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,370
Find a box for that.

145
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:18,736
Yes, we still have the kitchen table, but the chairs went about a half-hour ago.

146
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:22,922
Yeah let me stop you right there if you want to haggle, go to a flea market, because my other line is ringing.

147
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:26,666
Fine. It�s yours. Be here in 20 minutes, or I'll reactivate the listing.

148
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:30,816
Sold for $15 more than I paid 2 years ago see, the key to haggling

149
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,360
is you put your hands around their throat and keep on squeezing.

150
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:34,587
You've got skills, baby.

151
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,115
I know. Think of how useful I'll be when we're in India.

152
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:38,929
Oh remind me -- we have to pack Advil.

153
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,982
If I get a headache over there, I'm not about to get some Ayurvedic massage.

154
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:46,078
Sure, just to clarify, you are gonna tame it down a little
when we're in India, right? I mean we are tourists.

155
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,992
No way. My philosophy is "travel aggressively."
Otherwise, you get taken advantage of.

156
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:53,325
All these textbooks, backpacking?
I thought we agreed this is a vacation.

157
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:56,274
I'm not about to drop the ball now that I've gotten into Harvard medical school.

158
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,727
This is the time to turn up the intensity.

159
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,903
Paris...
It�s not gonna be like this forever,

160
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:05,444
I promise, but these next four years are critical. I've
got to do well so I can get a great to tier residency.

161
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:08,053
After that, I promise I'll rest.

162
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,082
What? Why are you smiling?

163
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:14,004
Because I love you.
Shut up. I love you, too.

164
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,311
Happy last day! Oh. Well, hello, lovebirds.

165
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:19,785
Where were you?

166
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:24,352
I went to a theater party with Lucy and Olivia,
and I spent the night at their place.

167
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:26,284
Hey, Doyle.
Hey, Rory.

168
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:28,887
Ah man, you guys are almost done packing up your stuff?

169
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:29,735
Getting there.

170
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:33,546
Can you believe we graduate tomorrow? I can't believe it. I can't wrap my head around it.

171
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,417
Oh God. You're not gonna start getting sentimental already, are you?

172
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,102
That wasn't sentimental. That was incredulous.

173
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:40,568
I'm allowed to be incredulous.
I mean can you believe it?

174
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:44,234
Ah yeah, I can, actually. I checked out of this place the second I got into Harvard.

175
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:46,293
God, I never get tired of saying that.

176
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:49,424
Well, I can't believe it, and I intend to savor every moment of it.

177
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:50,989
Well, savor while you spackle

178
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,184
I will take you to small-claims court if I don't get back my full deposit.

179
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:57,558
Hey, do you need any boxes?
Someone overestimated.

180
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,523
Let it go, Paris.

181
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:02,393
Ah no, I'm just taking all my stuff back home, so I'm just gonna throw it all in suitcases.

182
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:05,655
You know what I should take a picture
of you packing up the apartment.

183
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,052
And that�s not sentimental?

184
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:11,253
Oh, shush. I'm allowed a little bit of sentiment on my last day of college. Now smile.

185
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:14,413
Are you done?
No, no. I need a picture of Doyle.

186
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:18,040
He�s packing up the toaster. Oh, no toast tomorrow. That�s so sad.

187
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,031
Rory.

188
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:21,003
One more of you with that annoyed face.

189
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:23,886
That�s not cute. Make the annoyed face again

190
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:26,797
Oh, you're so good. You're a natural. I love it.

191
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:36,381
Oh, hey.
Hello!

192
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,522
He�s upstairs. I'm sure you can go right on up.

193
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:40,322
Oh no that�s okay. I'm just here for coffee.

194
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:42,469
Sure you are.
I am.

195
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,707
Honey, we were there.
We heard the song.

196
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,229
It gave me goose bumps.
The way you locked eyes with him.

197
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,260
All of that pent-up emotion -- ooh.

198
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:53,152
No, no, no. It�s just karaoke.

199
00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:57,783
You know I got swept up in the lyrics and the moment. It didn't mean anything.

200
00:09:57,784 --> 00:09:59,349
What can I get for you?

201
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,298
Hi. Um, a coffee.
To go, right?

202
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:05,064
Okay.
Is Rory all excited?

203
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:01,030
Hi. Um, a coffee.

204
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:02,245
To go, right?

205
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:03,060
Okay.

206
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,060
Is Rory all excited?

207
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:06,315
Um yeah. She is.

208
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:09,271
I can't believe she�s done. I still got memories of her

209
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:10,966
as a little girl running around in my head.

210
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,092
Me too.

211
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,312
Hey, should I have a doughnut or a muffin?

212
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:16,978
Whatever you want.

213
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:19,066
How about a doughnut with a side of muffin?

214
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:24,527
So, uh, what time are we supposed to be there, anyway?

215
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:25,802
- Where?
- Yale.

216
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:27,351
Oh, yeah, hon, I need directions,

217
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,908
'cause Morey MapQuested it, but the campus is big.

218
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,427
I didn't know you guys all wanted to come.

219
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:33,351
Of course we do.

220
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:36,019
We wouldn't miss our little girl�s graduation.

221
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,283
Oh well I have to call her and see,

222
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:39,644
make sure there�s enough tickets.

223
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:40,570
Thanks, doll.

224
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:41,855
How many do you think we need?

225
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:43,975
Well, let�s see. There�s Morey and me and you

226
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,629
and Lane and Zach and Mrs. Kim

227
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,937
Lulu and Gypsy, plus one, she said.

228
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:52,093
That�s a lot of people.

229
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:54,181
Yeah maybe we should charter a van.

230
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:56,712
Ooh, speaking of the graduate.

231
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,412
Say hello to her from us!

232
00:10:58,413 --> 00:10:58,890
I will.

233
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,603
And ask her how long the ceremony is,

234
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:02,128
'cause I got to plan my snacks.

235
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:04,269
Hey!

236
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,063
Hey. You are not gonna believe it!

237
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:07,354
Okay. Hold on.

238
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,456
Believe what?

239
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:13,175
Milan Kundera is speaking at our graduation.

240
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,286
- Oh.
- What?

241
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:15,565
You're not a big Kundera fan?

242
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:18,368
Uh, no. I'm unbearably light on him.

243
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:19,166
I see.

244
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,148
Speaking of which,

245
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,002
do you think you can get some more graduation tickets?

246
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:23,524
It seems like the whole of stars hollow wants to come.

247
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,797
Oh, that�s sweet, but we only get four,

248
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:28,072
and people have been trying to get extra ones since September.

249
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:29,735
Oh, no. Anything on the black market?

250
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:31,750
No I think we're probably priced out of that.

251
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,767
All right well, you do know the house is gonna get egged.

252
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:35,204
I'm sorry. There�s nothing I can do.

253
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:36,436
I'll help you scrub it when I get home.

254
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:37,398
Wait a minute. Four?

255
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,190
There�s me, your dad, your grandparents, Logan.

256
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,500
Logan�s sitting with his friends

257
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,577
there�re like 20 guys he hasn't seen since last spring.

258
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,735
Mm gotcha.

259
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:46,049
So, are you nervous?

260
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,606
About Logan seeing his friends? Not really.

261
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,929
No. About seeing dad.

262
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,275
Oh, that. No.

263
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:54,113
Ah we talked last night, mostly about our beautiful daughter.

264
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:54,832
Oh.

265
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,110
We're both just so proud of you.

266
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,236
I think we're gonna be fine.

267
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:58,770
Good. What about Luke?

268
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:01,304
Oh, well, I was just in there, you know.

269
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,817
Trying to figure out how I feel.

270
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:03,190
And?

271
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,606
And the point is totally moot,

272
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,389
because he barely even looked at me.

273
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,022
What?

274
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:09,251
Yeah I must have completely embarrassed him,

275
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:11,327
in addition to completely embarrassing myself.

276
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:13,480
I've given you the "don't drink to excess" speech, right?

277
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,140
Well if you haven't, you've certainly taught me by example.

278
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:18,178
So, anyway, that�s that.

279
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:19,093
Are you okay?

280
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:23,742
Oh, yeah. I mean, I didn't know what I wanted, anyway, so...

281
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,061
Okay if you need anything...

282
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:26,223
Yeah. Thanks, hon.

283
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:27,381
All right listen I'm gonna go.

284
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:30,161
Logan and I have this romantic afternoon planned.

285
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:31,554
Oh? Really?

286
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:32,598
We're spackling.

287
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:35,777
Oh. Well, spackle well,

288
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,988
or whatever one says to encourage a successful spackle.

289
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:38,832
Have a good spackle?

290
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,642
Spackle on.

291
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:40,401
Break a spackle?

292
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:42,067
Knock on spackle if things work out.

293
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,123
Okay I'll talk to you later.

294
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:44,167
Tell him I said hi.

295
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:45,375
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

296
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,589
all right, everybody! That�s enough!

297
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,832
The meeting has come to order.

298
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,912
Now before we get down to official business,

299
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:56,316
I would like to unofficially thank all of you

300
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,275
for your concerns over my health.

301
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,187
I'm doing much better, thank you.

302
00:13:00,188 --> 00:13:01,592
We never heard. What did you do?

303
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:02,308
Yeah what happened?

304
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:03,967
I heard you slipped in the tub.

305
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,293
That�s right, I did.

306
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:07,310
Let that be a lesson to all of you.

307
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,774
Bathroom safety is a serious business.

308
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:11,293
One can never be too careful.

309
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:12,360
Now, onto�

310
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:14,959
I thought the paramedics found you in your living room.

311
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,891
Well, yes. The tub was, in fact, a pedi-spa.

312
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:19,589
I have bunions, and I was soaking,

313
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,205
but it still was exceedingly slippery.

314
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,396
Onto the next order of business.

315
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:28,533
Our esteemed friend and neighbor Kirk would like a permit

316
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:31,777
to do his performance-art piece called

317
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,076
"Kirk-in-a-box" in the town square.

318
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:35,988
It isn't a performance-art piece.

319
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:37,569
It is a feat of endurance

320
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,994
an attempt to stretch the bounds of human possibility.

321
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:42,196
And what exactly is "Kirk-in-a-box"?

322
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,589
I will be suspended 20 feet above the street

323
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,437
in a clear Lucite box with no food or water.

324
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:48,715
Like David Blaine.

325
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:50,329
Not at all. My box is smaller.

326
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:50,875
Why?

327
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,693
Because Lucite is very costly.

328
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:54,382
No. Why are you doing it?

329
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:55,737
To see if I can.

330
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:58,611
Let me point out that something like this could draw a crowd.

331
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:01,588
Hey if Kirk wants to sit in a box, let him sit in a box.

332
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:02,851
Yeah, what do we care?

333
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:04,670
Yeah you don't have to look.

334
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:06,485
It�s a good idea! Let�s vote!

335
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:08,253
Very well. All those in favor.

336
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,878
All right, all right. But don't complain to me

337
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:14,980
when and if we run into a parking situation�

338
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:16,951
Is there special parking at Yale?

339
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:19,391
Oh, I meant to tell you. I couldn't get any extra tickets.

340
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,145
What? We don't get to go to Rory�s graduation?

341
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:22,869
I tried.

342
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,450
Isn't there anything you can do?

343
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,388
Well I asked.

344
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:27,488
Excuse me, ladies. What is going on over there?

345
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:30,262
None of us gets to go to Rory�s graduation.

346
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:31,799
I'm sorry. I tried.

347
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,022
Order! Order! Everyone, quiet down.

348
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,643
Clearly, this is an issue of importance to some of you,

349
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,696
so let�s just add it to tonight�s agenda.

350
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:41,737
No, no, no. Taylor, we don't have to do that.

351
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:44,095
Too late. It�s already been added.

352
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,368
Lorelai, state your case.

353
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:46,681
I don't have a case.

354
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:49,661
Fine. Then just explain how this mishap occurred.

355
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:50,687
What mishap?

356
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,060
Clearly, you dropped the ball.

357
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:54,359
I didn't. They get four per kid.

358
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,593
That�s how it works. What could I do? I tried.

359
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:58,963
Were there no orphans, no children of divorce?

360
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,447
Are you telling me that every single student at Yale

361
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:04,447
has at least four people coming to see him or her graduate?

362
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:08,119
Look, I'm sorry okay, but you'll all get a chance to congratulate her

363
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,415
at the graduation party I'm having at my house in a week.

364
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,031
But it�s not the same thing.

365
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:14,236
We've all known the kid since she was that high.

366
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:17,705
We want to see that special moment when she gets handed her diploma.

367
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,661
I'm really sorry, guys. I mean

368
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:22,052
maybe I could hand her the diploma again you know,

369
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,424
at the party at my house.

370
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:25,283
- You would do that?
- Of course.

371
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:26,292
Well what about the music?

372
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,494
You can't have the pomp without the circumstance.

373
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,867
That�s an easy one to solve.

374
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:31,626
The stars hollow high school band will play.

375
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:35,151
It will be a wonderful dress rehearsal for their own ceremony in two weeks.

376
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,084
I don't know if I can fit the whole band inside the house.

377
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:42,274
Absolutely not -- your house is not zoned

378
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:42,274
Absolutely not -- your house is not zoned

379
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,374
for gatherings larger than 15 people.

380
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,052
We'll do it in the town square.

381
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,606
Oh, that sounds�

382
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:51,192
Lulu can play Rory. She�s a terrific actress.

383
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:52,764
What are you, nuts? No way.

384
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,172
Rory�s gonna play Rory.

385
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:56,483
Oh, and at the ceremony at Yale,

386
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:57,966
don't forget to take a lot of pictures,

387
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,008
'cause then we can blow them up for the re-enactment!

388
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,556
Uh, uh, okay.

389
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:04,178
I would suggest taking a notebook along.

390
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:07,204
Attention to detail is very important in re-enactments.

391
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,371
We'd love to have you back at the D.A.R.

392
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,752
So much, you were a breath of fresh air.

393
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,861
We want to start a little outreach program.

394
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:19,181
You wouldn't believe your generation�s apathy

395
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:21,251
when it comes to such things

396
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:22,400
as the preservation of this nation�s history.

397
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,336
Oh really yeah that�s a shame.

398
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:26,421
We were thinking of renting out a roller rink�

399
00:16:26,422 --> 00:16:29,330
I'm sorry, ladies. Mind if I steal my girlfriend away for a minute?

400
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,562
Some rather urgent business.

401
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:31,811
Of course not.

402
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:34,134
- We'll talk later.
-  Excuse me.

403
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:36,386
Oh you really are my shining, armored knight. You know that.

404
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:37,694
I saw you dying,

405
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:39,415
and I did want to tell you something rather urgent.

406
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,154
What�s up?

407
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:42,192
- You look beautiful.
- Oh!

408
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,119
I just can't believe you're old enough

409
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,691
to have a daughter in college.

410
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:48,817
- Yeah�
- Neither can I.

411
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:50,705
What is your skin-care ritual?

412
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,318
Oh, just soap, you know?

413
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:53,163
What kind?

414
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:54,931
I just get it at the drugstore.

415
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,163
Will you excuse me?

416
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:57,700
Chris, hi.

417
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,547
- Where are you going?
-  I'll be right back.

418
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:03,700
That wasn't the question.

419
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:06,339
Where are you? Oh. There you are.

420
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,213
- Hey.
- Hey.

421
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:10,802
Sorry. I just didn't want to do this in front of everyone.

422
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:13,861
No, no. I think that�s a good thing.

423
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:15,941
- Hi.
- Hi.

424
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:17,683
You look good.

425
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,490
You look good.

426
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:21,285
So, how is she?

427
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:24,217
Oh, she�s excited. She�s good. She�s excited.

428
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:25,138
Yeah? And you?

429
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:28,809
I'm excited, sad, and nostalgic.

430
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,695
Terrified.

431
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:32,839
Logan asked my permission to ask her to marry him.

432
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:35,147
- What?
- Yeah. I know.

433
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:36,554
Yeah. I know. I mean he hasn't done it yet,

434
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,710
you know so maybe he'll back out,

435
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:40,293
but he definitely asked.

436
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,522
- Wow.
- Yeah.

437
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:42,941
She�s so young.

438
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:43,458
I know.

439
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,678
So what did you say?

440
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,692
I told him he could ask her.

441
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:47,812
Right. Yeah.

442
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:48,727
What do you think?

443
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:50,546
I'm just letting it sink in.

444
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:54,261
You know, you hear about people asking the father.

445
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:55,804
Not that you don't deserve to be asked

446
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:58,443
you do. It�s just more stuff I've missed.

447
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,830
We're gonna figure out this whole divorced-parenting thing eventually.

448
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,214
She might be 60.

449
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:07,282
Well, 60-year-olds are notoriously needy.

450
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:08,730
At least we'll be in sync by then.

451
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:11,639
You want to come see her?

452
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,455
- Let�s do it.
- Okay.

453
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:16,551
Hey, kiddo!

454
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:17,560
Hi, dad.

455
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:18,194
Hey.

456
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:20,510
Hey it�s good to see you.

457
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:21,895
Good to see you, too, sir.

458
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:22,900
So, are you getting excited?

459
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,598
Yeah, I can't believe it�s tomorrow.

460
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,241
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,

461
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:28,141
first let me thank you for coming

462
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:31,188
to celebrate my granddaughter�s graduation.

463
00:18:31,189 --> 00:18:33,320
Ouch! I do beg your pardon.

464
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,760
Celebrating our granddaughter�s graduation.

465
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,290
I can't let him take all the credit.

466
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,827
Have you seen her? Can you blame me?

467
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:42,299
So, when my wife and I sat down to write our toast,

468
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,053
we ran into something of a problem.

469
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,434
All of our words sounded too mundane,

470
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:49,689
too insignificant to mark such an auspicious occasion

471
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,314
as Rory�s graduation from Yale.

472
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:54,238
So instead...

473
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:55,610
maestro...

474
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:57,801
Please excuse us. We're not singers.

475
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,563
Never let them see you sweat, dear.

476
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:04,994
You're the top

477
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:09,027
you have graduated.

478
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:10,947
You're the top

479
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:14,091
your grandparents are elated.

480
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:18,144
Newspaper editor. Phi Beta Kappa wow!

481
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:21,003
You're a revelation. A huge sensation.

482
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:23,428
You should take a bow.

483
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,642
You are done.

484
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:29,830
No more school for you.

485
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:32,323
There is nothing.

486
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,487
Now that you can't do.

487
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,378
You'll make us proud, we'll sing it loud.

488
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,807
It�s true!

489
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:45,285
'Cause now, Rory you're a Bulldog through and through.

490
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:49,229
Yeah!

491
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,073
Please stop.

492
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:52,287
Oh, thank you, thank you.

493
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:54,141
Wow. Thank you for that.

494
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,202
We meant every word of that song.

495
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:58,572
We certainly did, even the ones we sang off-key.

496
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,543
We are so proud of you.

497
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:01,909
Oh thank you so much.

498
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,699
You know that none of this would
be possible without your help so.

499
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:06,094
You should all know that

500
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:08,492
there�s no way I could be a Bulldog

501
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:10,289
through and through if
it weren't for these two,

502
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,126
so thank you so much,
grandma and grandpa.

503
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:14,705
Congratulations, Rory.

504
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:16,187
To you.

505
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:17,159
Cheers.

506
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,398
Oh, it�s the babysitter, checking to see
if Gigi Can watch an hour of television.

507
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,116
I don't think she�s ready for "The
Pussycat Dolls." I'll be right back.

508
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:27,478
Actually, would you mind waiting?

509
00:20:27,755 --> 00:20:28,199
Sure.

510
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,869
trust me you'll want to
stick around for this.

511
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:30,422
Okay

512
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:32,253
Is he gonna...

513
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:34,425
Not here. Not now.

514
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:38,985
If I could, I'd also like to say a few words
about my girlfriend of the past three years.

515
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:43,719
You amaze me, Rory
Gilmore, every day --

516
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:46,028
everything that you do,
everything that you are.

517
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:50,466
This past year, I realized that I don't
know a lot more than I thought I knew,

518
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:54,516
if that makes sense. I'm a little bit
nervous. I didn't think I would be.

519
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:57,310
What I'm trying to say is that...

520
00:20:58,685 --> 00:20:59,652
I don't know a lot.

521
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:02,495
But I know that I love you...

522
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:05,153
and I want to be with you...

523
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:06,884
forever.

524
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,596
Rory Gilmore..

525
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:22,788
will you marry me?

526
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:31,114
Wow.

527
00:21:31,884 --> 00:21:36,227
Um, wow.
I -- wow.

528
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:38,641
Is there a "yes" in
between those "wows"?

529
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:41,457
Um, I'm just� I'm so...

530
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,738
surprised.
I-I just --

531
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:49,891
would -- um... w-will you
come talk to me outside?

532
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:51,444
Sure.

533
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:56,105
Play something
-- now.

534
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,565
Sorry. I-I didn't want to

535
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:09,562
talk in front of everybody.

536
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,874
No. I completely understand.

537
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:11,585
Is that�

538
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:12,479
For us? Yeah.

539
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:15,282
I�m sorry I know you said
you were over big gestures

540
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:16,970
but that�s what wedding proposals are

541
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:18,737
And night with your parents here and
your grandparents, I just thought...

542
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:21,125
No, it�s not the size of the gesture.

543
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,037
It�s the gesture itself.

544
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:24,456
Rory, I got the job
out in silicon valley.

545
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:26,404
What? You did? When?!

546
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:29,069
They offered me the position
about 45 minutes after the meeting,

547
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,823
but I wanted to save the
news until after I proposed.

548
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,405
Wow. You've been thinking
about this for a while.

549
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:37,298
Yeah. Back when everything was
up in the air business-wise,

550
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,599
I realized as long as
I had you, I'd be okay.

551
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:43,306
You would love Palo Alto, Rory.

552
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:47,639
We could go hiking in the Dish on
weekends, biking at the Baylands.

553
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:49,824
Wow. California sounds really athletic.

554
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:52,114
Or coffee drinking on university avenue.

555
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:53,826
That�s much easier to imagine.

556
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:55,000
I went exploring a little,

557
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:57,350
and there is this house
that we could rent.

558
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:59,653
It has a backyard with an avocado tree.

559
00:22:59,732 --> 00:23:00,798
I do like guacamole.

560
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,753
And it�s only 35 miles
south of San Francisco --

561
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:04,289
just a straight shot up the 101.

562
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:05,642
Wow you've done a lot of research.

563
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:08,317
Yeah you could work at the Chronicle,
The San Francisco Bay Guardian.

564
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:13,145
Wow. Oh, it sounds amazing. Logan,

565
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,227
Logan, it sounds
wonderful. I just --

566
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,491
I don't know. I mean,

567
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:21,502
you've had time to think about
this and research. It�s so sweet

568
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:22,927
and wonderful.
I just --

569
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:25,128
I'm hearing about it for the first time.

570
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:27,490
So you�re saying in the past three years,
you never thought about marrying me?

571
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,497
No, of course I have.

572
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:29,099
And?

573
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,616
And it�s always a
really wonderful thought,

574
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:33,361
but it was always hypothetical and�

575
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,102
I know. For me, too. But
then it hit me -- why wait?

576
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:41,070
Remember when we were in the life and death
brigade and we stood on top of that tower,

577
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,522
and we held hands and we jumped?

578
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:46,128
Let�s do that again, Rory. Let�s jump.

579
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,534
Well I don�t what to do,

580
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:54,161
should I continue to
stagger the hors d'oeuvres

581
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,958
or just tell the kitchen
to send everything out?

582
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:56,344
I don't know.

583
00:23:56,423 --> 00:23:57,934
What didn't she just say "yes"?

584
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,050
I think she�s not sure she
wants to marry him, mom.

585
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:01,659
That�s ridiculous. He�s a Huntzberger.

586
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:03,425
An offer like this doesn't
come around every day.

587
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,479
It�s a marriage proposal,
not a sale on linens.

588
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,854
Clearly, Rory was caught off guard.

589
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:08,861
All of us were.

590
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:11,575
I'm sure she just needs a
moment to get her bearings.

591
00:24:11,674 --> 00:24:12,306
Hi, hon.

592
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:14,162
Is that Rory? Did she say yes?

593
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:16,694
Hey, it�s Rory. Do you want to come?

594
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:17,483
No. You go.

595
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:18,816
Okay. Hi.

596
00:24:22,178 --> 00:24:24,318
I just couldn't answer him.
You know I just kept saying,

597
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,503
"I don't know. I'll have to think about it."
It was awful.

598
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,554
He was obviously disappointed
and upset. You know

599
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:32,980
he made all these plans about
the house we would live in

600
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,810
and the avocado tree in our backyard

601
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:36,280
Well, you do like guacamole.

602
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:39,936
just had to explain to him
how out of the blue this is.

603
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,595
I mean this is seriously out of the blue

604
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:43,692
out of the deepest,
darkest, naviest blue.

605
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:45,232
And why are you so calm, by the way?

606
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:49,003
Oh, well, he asked my
permission a couple days ago.

607
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:50,039
What? You knew?

608
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,486
I was dying to tell you.

609
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:53,252
Oh man you are a good secret keeper.

610
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:55,059
Not really. I told
Sookie. I told your dad.

611
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,727
Paul Anka and I discussed it at length.

612
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:57,963
So what do you think I should do?

613
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,392
Oh, honey, I think it�s your decision.

614
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,742
I know, but tell me what
you think I should do.

615
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:05,146
Well, I think you should take a few days

616
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:06,636
you know, let the shock wear off.

617
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:09,183
You're really not gonna
give me your opinion?

618
00:25:09,236 --> 00:25:10,510
Only you know what you want.

619
00:25:10,796 --> 00:25:11,556
Yeah.

620
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,636
I love him. I do. I mean,

621
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:17,285
things have been really amazing lately.

622
00:25:17,286 --> 00:25:18,984
But, on the other hand, we are so young.

623
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,103
I'm only 22.

624
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:22,610
On the other hand, what does
age matter when you're in love?

625
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,972
On the other hand, what is the rush?

626
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Well, you're like a circus
freak with all the hands.

627
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:28,143
Won't you just tell me what to do?

628
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:29,890
Honey, I'm sorry.

629
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:31,618
Oh! Okay

630
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:32,823
You don't have to say anything.

631
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:35,024
Just blink one eye if
you think I should do it.

632
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:36,014
No.

633
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,971
'Cause you don't?

634
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:38,363
'Cause I won't.

635
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:42,692
This is like the bird-versus-turtle
Halloween costume all over again.

636
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,081
Well I didn't crack then,
and I'm not gonna crack now.

637
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,625
I just think you need to figure it out.

638
00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:47,514
And
remember --

639
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:50,584
that flying turtle bird was the most
original costume in the third grade.

640
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:51,334
Yeah.

641
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:55,572
But this time I have to
choose -- turtle or bird?

642
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:57,339
Well, you're not in third grade anymore.

643
00:25:57,477 --> 00:25:58,297
Yeah, I guess not.

644
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:03,239
Hey, how many hours do
we have the carriage for?

645
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:05,252
Um, a couple more, I'm guessing.

646
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:08,247
Want to drive through the center
of town and do the queen wave?

647
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:09,327
Yes.

648
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,702
How�s it going?

649
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:34,334
Hey.

650
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:35,656
What are you doing out here so late?

651
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:38,177
I needed to take a walk to clear my head

652
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:40,339
and I wanted to see if
Kirk was still in the box.

653
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:42,723
Yeah apparently he is you know

654
00:26:42,841 --> 00:26:45,082
I wouldn't know. I've
decided to ignore him.

655
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:48,438
Gawking only encourages
his asinine behavior.

656
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,562
What about you? You're
usually long gone by now.

657
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:54,356
The softball team�s
celebrating their first win.

658
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,511
I couldn't get them out the door.
Clearing your head about what?

659
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,858
Logan proposed to Rory.

660
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:02,676
No way. Wow. Wow.

661
00:27:02,785 --> 00:27:05,302
I guess you would need a walk
for that. What did she say?

662
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:07,823
Well, she said she needed
time to mull it over.

663
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:08,336
Good answer.

664
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:09,698
I thought so.

665
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:11,682
So, did she ask for your advice?

666
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:12,749
She did. Yeah.

667
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:13,184
And?

668
00:27:13,494 --> 00:27:14,757
I told her it was her decision.

669
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:16,129
My mother�s picking out china patterns.

670
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,728
Oh, I bet she�s all over that.

671
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:19,002
So, you're leaning toward "no"?

672
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,865
Oh, uh, no. I'm not really
leaning. I'm kind of upright.

673
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:26,352
Oh well I just, I could
understand if you were

674
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:27,793
leaning away from "yes."

675
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:28,336
Why?

676
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:32,397
Well I mean she�s really young and
it�s the most important decision

677
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:34,341
of your life --
you know, her life.

678
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:37,237
Well, they love each
other. He�s been great.

679
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,393
Maybe they got it together
young. Some people do.

680
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:40,508
Right and others need time.

681
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,009
Sure. Or they're never ready.

682
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:43,608
I wouldn't say "never." Just

683
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:47,588
they want to be a little more careful.
They're a little slower, you know

684
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:48,546
just to make sure it�s right.

685
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,694
Well you can't always
be 100% sure it�s right.

686
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:52,254
Sometimes you just have
to take a leap of faith.

687
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:54,030
You got to know what
you're leaping into.

688
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:56,165
After all this time,
how could you not know?

689
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:57,409
How could who not know?

690
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:58,031
Rory.

691
00:27:58,189 --> 00:27:58,662
Right.

692
00:27:59,038 --> 00:27:59,413
Right.

693
00:27:59,561 --> 00:27:59,896
Rory.

694
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:05,508
Well, that was my walk,
and, uh, I'm gonna head home.

695
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,268
Good enough

696
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,621
Oh, I almost forgot something. Hang on.

697
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:14,251
Are you allowed to talk in there?

698
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:16,759
Rules are a little gray on that!

699
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:34,807
I got this for Rory.

700
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:35,784
Oh.

701
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:40,182
Yeah. I just thought it would be better if
she got it on the day of her actual graduation.

702
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:42,531
Oh, that�s -- that�s
-- that�s nice.

703
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,182
Yeah, so...

704
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:45,032
Thoughtful.

705
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:48,428
So, good night.

706
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,565
Good night.

707
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:53,775
Good night, Kirk.

708
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:55,157
Good night.

709
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,782
I'm just saying he�s a superb writer.

710
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,811
I'm just saying that a superb writer

711
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:30,379
does not a superb speaker make. I could barely stay awake.

712
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,051
I told you to start with coffee. It�s a two-ceremony day.

713
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:34,353
Maybe it�s just a cultural thing.

714
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:37,198
Maybe Milan Kundera is the Robin Williams of the Czech republic.

715
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,969
With that voice? So soporific it was

716
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,230
as if he were trying to perform a mass hypnosis.

717
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:42,681
We should hurry up if we want to get

718
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:44,907
good seats to watch Rory get her diploma.

719
00:30:44,908 --> 00:30:47,523
My point is, with all the potential speakers out there,

720
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:49,118
why choose someone so dull?

721
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,693
You know for a while, Rory said they were considering Henry Winkler.

722
00:30:51,694 --> 00:30:52,429
That would have been neat.

723
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:52,898
Who?

724
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:53,954
You mean Henry Kissinger?

725
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:55,479
Not unless he played the Fonz.

726
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,341
I'm assuming that Logan will join us

727
00:30:57,342 --> 00:30:58,714
for the actual commencement at Branford.

728
00:30:58,715 --> 00:30:59,945
- Nope.
- No?

729
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:01,165
He�s sitting with his friends.

730
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,482
Plus, I think it would be awkward, you know?

731
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:05,418
I don't know. No one knows. Only Rory.

732
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:06,379
Well, mom...

733
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,863
Well I just can't believe you don't have more information.

734
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:11,139
She said she�s thinking about it so she�s thinking.

735
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,972
What is she thinking?

736
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:13,379
- I don't know.
- Why not?

737
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,461
Actually, Kissinger would be duller than Kundera

738
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:17,397
with that foghorn voice and that accent.

739
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:19,391
Of the two, I'd vote for the Fonz.

740
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:20,769
Do you even know who the Fonz is?

741
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,294
Oh, wait, wait. Oh, shoot.

742
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:22,939
What�s wrong?

743
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,766
I promised Patty and Babette

744
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,335
that I would get lots of extra programs for the re-enactment.

745
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:28,294
Oh here. You can have mine.

746
00:31:29,174 --> 00:31:31,098
What? It was hot. I needed a fan.

747
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,863
Sweetheart, I'm sure I can use some of my many contacts

748
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:36,074
to procure as many programs as you need.

749
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,975
Really? Could you? That would be great.

750
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,649
Can I have my program back, then?

751
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:42,934
As my friend Sylvia Rosenblat is saying, I'm "Shavitzing."

752
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:47,728
Shvitzing, mom. Shvitzing. Never mind.

753
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:50,359
So, seriously, 90% of the class

754
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,286
- was at this party�
- More!

755
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:53,080
And everyone�s watching.

756
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:55,978
He starts to -- swear to god -- do the robot.

757
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:57,277
- Professor Watley?
- Uh-huh.

758
00:31:57,278 --> 00:31:58,916
Wait isn't he like 150?

759
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,599
I know, right. At first, we thought he was having a seizure,

760
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,793
which you know would have been easier to take.

761
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:06,711
That was so funny, an awesome party, by the way.

762
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:09,010
I thought you were gonna come after your grandparents' little cocktail bash.

763
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:11,901
Yeah, Gilmore, you're so lame for blowing it off.

764
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:13,831
Yeah at least I had an excuse.

765
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,928
My boyfriend and I went to �Star of Bombay� as a little warm-up for our trip to India.

766
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:19,846
It turns out Doyle�s stomach and Vindaloo are not bunk buddies.

767
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:21,297
It�s gonna be a long trip.

768
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:23,983
Well I would have gone to that party if somebody hadn't insisted

769
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:27,057
that I finish spackling all the holes in our apartment, upon pain of death.

770
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:30,347
Hey, each unspackled hole is deposit money that our hygienically challenged,

771
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,731
sleazebag of a landlord will use to supply his freaking porn habit.

772
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:35,467
College has mellowed Paris.

773
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:37,598
How was your grandparents' cocktail party?

774
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,429
Were there great huzzahs in your honor?

775
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,142
Oh it was fine.

776
00:32:41,143 --> 00:32:43,893
People walked around, had grown-up drinks, and

777
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:46,375
my grandparents sang me a song. I turned a deep shade of red.

778
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:47,526
It was fine.

779
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:49,332
Uh-oh it looks like you guys are lining up.

780
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,139
We better get over to Saybrook.

781
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:52,658
To our future!

782
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:54,274
Huzzah!

783
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:57,406
I wonder if I'll actually get my diploma in my envelope.

784
00:32:57,407 --> 00:32:58,986
Why? Do you have some overdue library books?

785
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:00,860
And she has no idea where they are.

786
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:02,441
Please forward my mail to Argentina.

787
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:05,268
I'll be hiding out until the heat blows over. I love you guys!

788
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:06,907
- Bye!
- Bye!

789
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:08,441
Did she try on the ring?

790
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:09,473
I have no idea.

791
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:11,397
I can't believe you have no idea what she�s going to do.

792
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:13,239
I mean aren�t you two �bosom buddies�

793
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,849
Isn't the sharing of intimate information your thing?

794
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,813
Mom our thing right now is letting Rory make her own decisions.

795
00:33:18,814 --> 00:33:20,010
What did you tell her to do?

796
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:22,529
Mom I didn't tell her to do anything.

797
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,948
I'm letting her make her own decision.

798
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:25,016
But you must have at least�

799
00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:26,822
Emily can we focus on the ceremony?

800
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,913
So, are these seats okay? Can you both see the stage?

801
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:30,816
Perfectly.

802
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:32,329
Well, I'm sure someone will take a photo

803
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,884
of Rory receiving her diploma close-up.

804
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:37,306
Mom, if you don't like these seats, we can go look for others.

805
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,526
No. Then we'll lose these.

806
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:41,077
Well we can have dad wait here while I try to find better seats�

807
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:42,520
Lorelai, these seats are fine.

808
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,104
Hey!

809
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,758
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

810
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,720
You're not late.

811
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:48,476
The ceremony is starting late, of course,

812
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:50,870
after Lorelai drove us like cattle to get here.

813
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:53,459
You be the deciding vote. Are these seats okay,

814
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,148
or do you think we should look for better ones?

815
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:56,245
These seem great.

816
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:59,050
Really? Because that lady has long hair,

817
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:00,223
and if a breeze blows up, it might�

818
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:01,827
Lorelai, Lorelai, the seats are perfect.

819
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:02,660
All righty.

820
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:04,358
- Any answer from Rory?
- Not yet.

821
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:06,258
Apparently Lorelai has decided to invoke

822
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:07,572
the "don't ask, don't tell" rule.

823
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:08,428
Oh mom.

824
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,971
Bill Clinton -- that�s a speaker I would have enjoyed.

825
00:34:10,972 --> 00:34:14,780
I can't stand his politics, but he has a commanding presence and a nice voice.

826
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:17,147
I wonder if he records books on tape.

827
00:34:18,211 --> 00:34:20,194
So have you thought about what you're going to say?

828
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:20,722
What?

829
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:22,114
When he hands you the diploma.

830
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:24,930
I can't decide between "thank you" and "thank you so much."

831
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:25,572
Oh.

832
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:27,795
It�s a significant moment, and I want to do it right.

833
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:30,000
If I say just plain "thank you," it sounds kind of casual,

834
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,713
ike he�s handing me a slice of pizza.

835
00:34:31,714 --> 00:34:33,235
But "thank you so much" sounds weird,

836
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:35,651
like I'm acknowledging applause after singing a love ballad.

837
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:38,936
I think I'm just gonna do a polite smile and a "thank you."

838
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:42,094
- Okay. This is it.
- Yeah.

839
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:44,170
We've been drafting off each other since high school,

840
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:46,047
and now it�s each woman for herself.

841
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:47,815
Who knows when we'll see each other again, right?

842
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:49,815
Paris I haven't been able to shake you off all these years.

843
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:52,114
We're gonna be friends for a very long time.

844
00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:54,950
You're gonna do such great things with your life, Rory.

845
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:58,384
Oh! Wow. Okay.

846
00:34:58,385 --> 00:35:00,974
Okay, g�s, you're on the move!

847
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,006
Unto the breach.

848
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,496
Phoebe Elizabeth Gabner.

849
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:21,554
You ready to be parents of a Yale graduate?

850
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:23,651
I already got the bumper sticker picked out.

851
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:25,446
Just so you know, I read in the New York Times

852
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:27,683
that people are getting married younger and younger these days.

853
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,792
Well the good news is, if it was in the New York Times,

854
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:31,669
Rory saw it and filed it away. What�s wrong?

855
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,789
This chair is faulty. Every time I lean

856
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,663
from one side to the other, I almost slide off.

857
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:37,924
Do you want to switch seats?

858
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:39,578
Now Lorelai, you don't need to switch.

859
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:41,886
Emily, your chair�s fine. Just don't lean.

860
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:44,502
I have to lean. This woman keeps rocking back and forth.

861
00:35:44,503 --> 00:35:46,396
It�s like sitting behind Ray Charles.

862
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:48,249
Paris Eustace Geller.

863
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,912
Oh, Paris!

864
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,387
I'm just saying you have pull. Use it.

865
00:35:52,388 --> 00:35:53,534
That�s what parenting is.

866
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:54,719
Don�t know if her family is here,

867
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,534
I'm gonna take a picture for Rory.

868
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:56,707
She looks up to you,

869
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:59,428
and when a child looks up to you and has a difficult decision to make,

870
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:00,566
you tell her what to do.

871
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:02,091
That�s not how I do it.

872
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,223
So you're just content�

873
00:36:03,224 --> 00:36:05,675
Emily, please. Rory is next.

874
00:36:05,676 --> 00:36:06,892
Roberta Gelson.

875
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:08,264
Honey, tell me what time it is.

876
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:09,836
I told everyone I'd notice the exact time

877
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,883
so that when we do the re-enactment they would have the�

878
00:36:11,884 --> 00:36:14,897
Lorelai, I will note the time. I will take the photo.

879
00:36:14,898 --> 00:36:18,249
You just sit there and enjoy your daughter�s graduation from Yale.

880
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,757
This is as much your moment as Rory�s.

881
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,329
Enjoy it.

882
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,848
Lorelai Leigh Gilmore.

883
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,830
Yay, Rory!

884
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,754
All right, everyone. Say "Fromage."

885
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:51,352
Dad.

886
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:52,267
Must you always do that?

887
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:54,109
Entertain them with that in the Great War?

888
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,748
- Got it.
-  Excellent.

889
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:57,648
All right what other combinations haven't we done?

890
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,314
Um, duh. Me, mom, and dad.

891
00:36:59,315 --> 00:37:01,009
"Duh"? That�s our Yale graduate.

892
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,276
She meant �Doy�.

893
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:03,927
All right. Everybody,

894
00:37:03,928 --> 00:37:05,179
everybody say...

895
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,302
- Don't!
- ...Whatever you like.

896
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,440
Got it.

897
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:11,170
Good, make sure you save it. You erased the last one.

898
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:12,484
I don't trust these things.

899
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:13,522
I'll be right back.

900
00:37:14,437 --> 00:37:17,182
Oh, Richard, Emily, can I get one with you guys?

901
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:19,933
Thank you. Good to see you.

902
00:37:20,378 --> 00:37:22,361
Hey. Congratulations.

903
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:23,006
Thanks.

904
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,598
Yeah you did great -- no tripping, no dropping the diploma.

905
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,308
No, nothing like that.

906
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:29,921
I remember when I graduated. I was a little tipsy

907
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:31,854
that�s a big surprise, huh? -- And I did trip,

908
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:34,842
and I reached out and grabbed the robe of Marcia Hadley,

909
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:36,481
who was so not the person to grab.

910
00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:37,595
Logan�

911
00:37:39,296 --> 00:37:40,610
I'm sorry�

912
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:42,669
I can't.

913
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:44,933
I love you.

914
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:47,686
You know how much I love you.

915
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,249
I love the idea of being married to you...

916
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:56,358
but... there are just

917
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:59,273
a lot of things right now in my life that are undecided.

918
00:38:00,094 --> 00:38:02,593
And that used to scare me,

919
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:04,947
but now I-I kind of like the idea that..

920
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:06,868
it�s just all kind of...

921
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,522
wide open.

922
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:10,991
And if I married you, it just wouldn't be.

923
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:14,241
So, what? I go to San Francisco, you stay on the east,

924
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:16,302
and we see each other occasionally?

925
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:18,050
Well, we can try long distance.

926
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:20,170
We've done it before.

927
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:21,672
You really think that�s gonna work?

928
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:23,584
I think it would be hard, but...

929
00:38:24,024 --> 00:38:27,097
I don't want to do that, Rory. I don't want to go backwards.

930
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,015
If we can't take the next step...

931
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:30,505
What?

932
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:32,205
I mean...

933
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:35,780
Does it have to be all or nothing?

934
00:38:36,868 --> 00:38:38,358
Yeah, it does.

935
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:43,469
But we could at least try.

936
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:47,578
What�s the point?

937
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,469
So...

938
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:54,845
So...

939
00:39:15,464 --> 00:39:16,789
goodbye, Rory.

940
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:30,147
Okay. Just one more trip.

941
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:32,945
No! I can't.

942
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:35,643
This is why we don't exercise. It�s too exhausting.

943
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:37,657
Well it wouldn't be so exhausting if we exercised.

944
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:40,801
Oh, darn your college-graduate logic.

945
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:43,003
How you doing, honey?

946
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:44,619
Uh, okay.

947
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,508
Yeah?

948
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:48,616
Well, I'm not okay.

949
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:51,373
I feel awful. I feel sick.

950
00:39:51,374 --> 00:39:53,091
I miss him already.

951
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:53,725
I know.

952
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,496
And it just sucks, you know, because

953
00:39:55,497 --> 00:39:56,915
I graduated today.

954
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,317
This was supposed to be a happy day in my life, and

955
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:00,367
now when I look back on it,

956
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:03,015
I'm just gonna think about this horrible thing that happened.

957
00:40:03,649 --> 00:40:04,857
I'm sorry.

958
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:07,270
I think you made the right decision.

959
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,687
- You do?
- I do.

960
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:11,540
Someday you'll meet someone,

961
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,135
and you'll just know it�s right.

962
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:16,493
You won't want to hesitate. You'll just know.

963
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:18,042
I hope so.

964
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,434
I really do believe it.

965
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:23,998
So I guess no avocado trees.

966
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:26,203
Well, no avocado tree.

967
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:28,543
You know, I think I'll get my own avocado tree.

968
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:31,074
See? You could get your own cherry tree,

969
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,097
get your own peanut tree,

970
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,244
just have peanut butter all day long.

971
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:37,226
Peanuts don't grown on trees. They grow under the ground.

972
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,693
Whatever. My point is you can have anything you want.

973
00:40:41,664 --> 00:40:44,139
Oh, yes. It�s wide open.
