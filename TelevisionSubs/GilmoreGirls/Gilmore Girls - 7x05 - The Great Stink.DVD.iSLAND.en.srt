1
00:00:00,864 --> 00:00:05,512
Okay. Toothbrush, hairbrush,
hypoallergenic pillow,

2
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:08,082
chenille blanket --
ooh, comfort shoes.

3
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:10,058
- Got them.
- Those are your comfort shoes?

4
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:12,158
- Not mine -- Paul Anka's.
- We're staying in tonight.

5
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:13,836
You can probably
get away with flats.

6
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:15,504
He loves, loves,
loves chewing on these.

7
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,009
They remind him of
a squirrel carcass.

8
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:18,161
- Yummy.
- Don't judge.

9
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:20,070
You eat jerky like it's
going out of style.

10
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:22,392
So, all this stuff
is for Paul Anka?

11
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:24,098
No, not all.
The toothbrush is mine.

12
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,420
- Lorelai.
- What?

13
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,261
It's his first night
staying at your house.

14
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:29,871
I want him to have all the stuff
that makes him comfortable.

15
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:30,934
Ooh -- tennis balls!

16
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:32,538
I actually have tennis balls.

17
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:34,281
- Penn or Wilson?
- You're joking.

18
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:35,502
Paul Anka's must be Penn.

19
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:37,179
They must be new,
they must be green --

20
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:38,886
not orange and green,
just green.

21
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:41,800
And FYI, you might want to watch
that sarcastic tone of yours

22
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,642
because dogs are very
attuned to tone.

23
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:46,416
It's kind of like chinese,
in that respect, dog language.

24
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:47,605
It's very tone based.

25
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,866
And you are stressing him
out right now with your tone.

26
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,467
The dog is stressed?

27
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:52,650
Look at him.

28
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,029
And when he gets like this,

29
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:57,145
you need to talk to him in
sweet and dulcet tones.

30
00:00:57,162 --> 00:01:00,963
Hi, Paul Anka.
Ooh, hi, boy! Hi!

31
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,333
- Get it?
- Got it.

32
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,042
Good. Sunglasses.

33
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:07,408
This is not normal.
I want you to know that.

34
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:09,097
The dog wears Ferragamos?

35
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,071
Oh, please.
Don't give him any ideas.

36
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:11,984
These are mine.

37
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:13,883
All right, let's go.
You take this, this, and this.

38
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:15,781
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

39
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:25,438
Oops. Here, Paul Anka.

40
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:26,136
Hey.

41
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:27,529
- Hey, you watching it?
- What?

42
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,320
- The meteor shower.
- What meteor shower?

43
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:32,354
It was on the news. The BBC said
there's some huge meteor shower tonight.

44
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:33,437
I thought we could
watch it together.

45
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:36,255
Uh, Logan, I have been in the
library for the past nine hours.

46
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:37,683
I don't know anything
about any meteor showers.

47
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:39,422
I could use a regular
shower, though.

48
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:41,195
Go up on the roof
and check it out.

49
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,700
- Now?
- Yes, now!

50
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:44,425
It's supposed to start
in like two minutes.

51
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:47,427
Ace! This is once-in-a-lifetime
celestial event. Get going.

52
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:49,262
Okay, okay.
I'm getting. I'm going.

53
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,469
Are you running?

54
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:51,888
I'm  running! I'm running!

55
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:53,941
Who knew you were such
an astronomy buff?

56
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:54,794
Hurry!

57
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:56,386
What has gotten into you?

58
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:58,552
Nice night.

59
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:00,700
Oh, my god!

60
00:03:00,718 --> 00:03:03,214
You're here!
What are you doing here?

61
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,333
Happy to see me?

62
00:03:05,347 --> 00:03:07,474
Beyond happy! Ecstatic!

63
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,083
I can't believe you're here!

64
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,945
And look at me --
I'm covered in highlighter ink

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,389
and I smell like
Fritos and Ginger ale.

66
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:14,494
It's an aphrodisiac.

67
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:16,307
You're here and
you did all this?

68
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,400
You like?

69
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:19,739
I love,
but you didn't have to do this.

70
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:22,464
I mean, you're here. It's enough.
It's more than enough.

71
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:24,669
Could you shut up now
so I can kiss you?

72
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,318
- So there is no meteor shower?
- No meteor shower.

73
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,286
So you used the entire
cosmos to trick me?

74
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,695
I like to think big.

75
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,812
So, what is going on?
Why are you here?

76
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:37,856
I'm kissing my
girlfriend on the roof.

77
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:40,848
But why?

78
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:43,840
The Fritos and Ginger ale thing.
I told you, huge turn-on.

79
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:46,880
Explain yourself.

80
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,261
I'm just here for a
quick business trip.

81
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:49,402
- How quick?
- Too quick.

82
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,592
How quick is "too quick"?

83
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,998
I have 10:00 flight back
to London tomorrow night.

84
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:54,428
Oh, that is too quick.

85
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:56,433
That website my team has
been trying to buy --

86
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,413
the owners finally agreed to sit down,
talk to us tomorrow over breakfast.

87
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,225
Logan! That's great, right?

88
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:03,124
I mean, three weeks ago,
they weren't even taking your calls.

89
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,381
It is great.
However, not as exciting

90
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:07,499
as kissing my
girlfriend on the roof.

91
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:13,215
- Um, so, what's that amazing smell?
- Food from Ibiza.

92
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,278
The island?

93
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:16,110
The tapas place downtown.

94
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:17,291
Ooh, did you get the duck?

95
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:18,392
I did.

96
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:21,020
- And the short ribs?
- Yes. And...

97
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:24,002
Ooh! A 2003 red something.

98
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:26,813
I bet it's very oaky and
corky and full of fruity legs.

99
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,850
Know a lot about wine, do you?

100
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:29,491
Not so much,
but the label's pretty.

101
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:32,568
There's also gazpacho, that
cheese-pie thing you love, plus flan.

102
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,459
Ooh, flan! You got me flan?

103
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:36,013
Doesn't take much to make you happy,
does it?

104
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:37,584
Not when you're on
this continent.

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,447
Okay, why don't you open this wine?
I want to taste those fruity legs,

106
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,885
and I'll make you a
plate with extra flan.

107
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,968
Okay.

108
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:48,324
Ooh, I'm so glad you're here!

109
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:56,159
Stop! You're killing my Tivo.

110
00:04:56,173 --> 00:04:59,030
I'm  not killing it. I'm composing on it.
I'm composing a symphony.

111
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:00,783
- Finally, an instrument I can play.
- Give me that.

112
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,175
- No, no, no!
- Give me!

113
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:04,082
- Not until you explain your choices.
- What?

114
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:07,322
"The View"? "Girlfriends"?
"Sábado Gigante"?

115
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:09,780
Who controls this thing,
you or Pedro Almodóvar?

116
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:10,834
It's the nanny.

117
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,408
Sure, it's a likely story.

118
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:13,645
Give me, give me, give me.

119
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:15,007
Did G.G. get to sleep okay?

120
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,114
She did. I tried to skip to
the end of "Cinderella,"

121
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:18,546
but she wouldn't let me.
It's my own fault.

122
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:20,395
My wicked stepsister
voice kills.

123
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:22,117
She's amazing, you know?

124
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:24,624
That reminds me.

125
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:29,115
Oh, no! You're not gonna show
me some of her art, are you?

126
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,619
I never know what to
say in those situations.

127
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:32,613
I mean, even when it was Rory's art,
you know?

128
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:36,057
Three blue finger smudges
and some construction paper.

129
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:37,964
It's not precocious.
It's just messy.

130
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:39,978
Here. This came a
couple of days ago.

131
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:41,630
It's from Sherry.

132
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:42,781
From Sherry?

133
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:45,390
Yeah, it's the first I've heard from
her since the divorce was final.

134
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:46,760
Go ahead. Read it.

135
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:48,764
Wow, how "dangerous
liaisons" of her.

136
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,992
She doesn't call.
She doesn't e-mail.

137
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:52,063
Then she sends you a
letter with a wax seal

138
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,392
that weighs roughly the
same as a porterhouse.

139
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:56,310
Well, she had a lot to say.

140
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:59,199
Gosh. It's a lot of sorry.

141
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:02,154
Yeah, 15 pages worth.
Believe me, I was not expecting this.

142
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,674
Humility is not a side of
Sherry I've ever seen before.

143
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:08,135
I don't know if it's the yoga
or the yoga instructor or --

144
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,278
Yoga instructor?

145
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:12,837
Yeah, she's dating her yoga instructor,
Jean-Claude or Jean-Pierre --

146
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,092
one of those names that
always sounds fake.

147
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,230
Anyway, it sounds like
she's really changed.

148
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,476
She feels awful about what happened,
run away like that,

149
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,786
and she wants to find a way to
be part of G.G.'s life again.

150
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:22,581
- Honey, that's great.
- Right?

151
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:23,979
Yeah.

152
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:26,742
So, you got this two days ago
and you're showing it to me now.

153
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:28,603
Well, I was gonna show it to
you a couple of days ago,

154
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,445
but then I figured you
were coming over, so...

155
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,085
- No, I'm not criticizing.
- You're not?

156
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,780
No, I'm complimenting --
badly, obviously.

157
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,294
But I'm complimenting.
You shared it with me.

158
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,390
I kind of thought that was how the
whole adult-relationship thing worked.

159
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:41,376
You know, openness, honesty.

160
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,240
Interesting.

161
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,887
And you're sure you don't want
to stash it away somewhere

162
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:47,158
and then I find it -- accidentally,
of course -- months from now,

163
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:49,777
and I get all weird and insecure about
why you didn't show it to me sooner?

164
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,911
I'm good with the sharing.

165
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:52,884
All right.
It's another way to go.

166
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:03,302
That glass slipper
will fit my foot.

167
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:05,372
That was my wicked
stepsister voice.

168
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:06,822
Yeah, I figured.

169
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,126
I'm so happy.

170
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,698
Me too.

171
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,538
You know you can't
do this in London?

172
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,366
The city lights are so bright,
you almost never see the stars.

173
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,361
Yeah, but it's London.

174
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:27,361
Wait, are you tired of London?

175
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:29,512
I'm tired of not
being around you.

176
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:31,631
Yeah, but you can't
be tired of London.

177
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:33,310
Samuel Johnson said,
"when you're tired of London,

178
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:34,765
you're tired of life."

179
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,614
Obviously, the man was never in
a long-distance relationship.

180
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,915
That's true.
Boswell did keep quite close.

181
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:43,637
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

182
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:45,487
You're trying to sneak
a peek at my watch.

183
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:48,204
Well, I just can't believe it.
I can't believe you're here.

184
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:53,303
And I can't believe that you're leaving
in only 26 hours and 45 minutes.

185
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:55,942
Come on, think positive -- that's
an entire lifetime to a fruit fly.

186
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:57,380
Actually, you're
thinking of a mayfly.

187
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:59,520
Fruit flies can live for up to a month.
So what do you think?

188
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:00,630
Can you stay for a month?

189
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,877
I mean, what if your meeting
tomorrow goes really, really well?

190
00:08:02,911 --> 00:08:03,835
I hope it does.

191
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:04,959
It will. It's a great idea.

192
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:06,375
It's basically myspace.

193
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:08,018
But by invitation only.

194
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,499
And it'll be like an online
version of the Algonquin Group,

195
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:11,593
like throwing a
party in your head

196
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,878
where everyone you've ever
wanted to talk to is there --

197
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,246
Ira Glass, Sofia Coppola,
Flaubert, Danger Mouse.

198
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,077
The deal's not done yet.
Far from it.

199
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,687
These guys aren't just gonna
hand over their website

200
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:21,059
because we buy them breakfast.

201
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:24,790
They might. Tell them that they
can order pancakes and eggs.

202
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,038
Don't make them choose.

203
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:29,144
Sausage, bacon, fruit, potatoes --
let them get the whole combo.

204
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,504
'Cause then they will have to sell
it to you. It'd be rude not to.

205
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:33,049
You are a business genius, Ace.

206
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:34,705
Well, I'm taking econ
with my grandpa.

207
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,645
Whatever happens,
we'll be ready.

208
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,482
We've been working our asses off on
this one -- Nick, Bobby, Phillip.

209
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:42,368
Oh, yes -- Phillip, Nick, Bobby.
The team. Starting lineup.

210
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:45,379
It is a classic win-win.
They give us a foothold in new media.

211
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,721
We give them a huge influx of capital,
which they need.

212
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:50,071
Believe me, when it comes to debt
versus equity, they're screwed.

213
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:52,545
They have no liquidity,
huge expenses, zero revenue.

214
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,009
I mean, the targeted
advertising potential alone --

215
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:56,536
What? What are you staring at?

216
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:58,913
You, "Mr. Debt Versus Equity."

217
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:01,529
- Are you mocking me?
- Yeah, but I like it.

218
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:05,030
Tell  me more about this um,
targeted advertising potential.

219
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,737
What do you want to know?
There's pay-per-click,

220
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:09,377
pay-per-lead, banner ads,
pixel tagging.

221
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,926
Oh, stop.
I'm getting weak at the knees.

222
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:17,561
Logan?

223
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:20,130
Shh. Go back to sleep.
It's only 6:00.

224
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:22,288
- In the morning?
- Yes, in the morning.

225
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:24,418
Go back to sleep.
I'm sorry I woke you.

226
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,019
Hey, where you going?
Come back here.

227
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,822
I can't, I promised Nick, Bobby,
and Phillip I'd meet up with them

228
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:30,227
- for breakfast before the pitch.
- I thought the pitch was at breakfast.

229
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:32,587
It is, but we can't walk in there
unprepared. We got to go over our notes,

230
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:34,724
talk strategy.
It's a pre-Breakfast breakfast.

231
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:36,663
- Work dork.
- Did you just call me a work dork?

232
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,532
Admit it.
Just admit that you're a work dork.

233
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:41,373
I'll admit that I'm a work dork if you
admit that you love that I'm a work dork.

234
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:42,475
Done.

235
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:44,240
Now I really have to go.

236
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:45,734
Hey, I have ways of making you stay,
you know.

237
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,732
I know, I know,
but take pity on me, please.

238
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:49,755
After work,
I promise I'm all yours. Dinner?

239
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,432
Is it a pre-dinner
dinner or a real dinner?

240
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:53,245
As many dinners as you want.

241
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,727
Aw, man, I can't believe we've
wasted 4 1/2 hours on sleep.

242
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:57,397
What are we down to now,
like 15 hours?

243
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,640
Rory, I'm actually gonna need
both arms for this pitch.

244
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:00,822
Okay, I'll let go.
Just one more kiss.

245
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:02,663
- I don't believe you.
- Try me.

246
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,933
- Hey! No fair!
- I'll call you later.

247
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:08,272
- Work dork!
- Work dork lover.

248
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:17,002
You need a tissue?
Oh, god, what is that?

249
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:18,354
I don't know,
but it's horrible.

250
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,799
Oh,  it is. It's foul.
It's like rotten cabbage.

251
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:23,829
Or with dense but subtle
undertones of olives.

252
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:26,533
There's nothing subtle about it.
It's like a sledgehammer to the nose.

253
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:28,431
Oh, my god! What is that?

254
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:29,601
It's not coming
from the kitchen?

255
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,021
Bite your tongue.

256
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:33,094
Wait, are we having
heart attacks right now?

257
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:35,406
Isn't smelling something strange
the first sign of a heart attack?

258
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:37,314
I don't think we're having a
communal massive heart attack.

259
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,751
- Carcasses.
- What?

260
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,258
Those strange,
angry-looking guests --

261
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,416
I'm sure they are traveling
with decaying animal flesh.

262
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:44,631
Yeah, 'cause that's the
most logical explanation.

263
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,420
Gonna open a window,
see if we can air it out a little bit.

264
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:50,000
- No, no, no!
- Close it! Close it! Close it!

265
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:52,090
So glad we tried that.

266
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:53,989
All right, I'm going out there
to see what's causing this.

267
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:55,642
- Out there?!
- Are you crazy?!

268
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,693
Maybe, but the sooner we can
find out what's causing this,

269
00:10:57,726 --> 00:11:00,138
the sooner we can run like
hell to less stinky ground.

270
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,037
- I'm coming with you, then!
- Me too!

271
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,103
Let's hang for a minute.

272
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,316
If she makes it to the end of the block,
we'll join her.

273
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,053
- Michel!
- What?

274
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:08,663
Fine.

275
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:13,517
Kirk, where's everybody going?

276
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:15,349
Taylor called an
emergency town meeting.

277
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:16,479
Not sure why.

278
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:19,127
The smell, Kirk.
The horrible, horrible smell.

279
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:19,982
Really?

280
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:21,899
I just don't think
it's that bad.

281
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:23,652
Well, come on, let's go.

282
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:25,426
No. You know what?
On second thought,

283
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:27,635
I'd rather smell this smell
for the rest of my life

284
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:29,571
than see Luke at
a town meeting.

285
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:31,068
- Oh, honey.
- It's okay.

286
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,850
I'll go back to the Inn.
I'll be fine.

287
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:35,334
Just call me when you
want me to pick you up.

288
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,227
Finally!

289
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,828
It's about time, Taylor!
We're dying here.

290
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,445
I assure you, no one is dying.

291
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:45,819
The substance causing this odor

292
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,475
is not toxic in any way,
shape, or form.

293
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,729
- It's pickles.
- That's no pickle!

294
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,992
Pickle? Like one giant pickle?

295
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,563
Order!

296
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:57,756
As those of you who take an interest
in civic events may recall,

297
00:11:57,772 --> 00:12:00,298
three days ago a train
derailed just east of town --

298
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,602
luckily, no one was
injured. However,

299
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:06,561
3 1/2 tons of pickles and pickle
brine were scattered along the tracks.

300
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:09,686
And due to some inevitable
delays in cleanup,

301
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:13,696
those pickles have been baking
in the sun for three days.

302
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:16,045
And you knew about this?

303
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:17,320
It's a cover-up.

304
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,173
We got picklegate!

305
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,473
I did know about it, but it wasn't
a problem until this morning

306
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:24,273
when the wind shifted.

307
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:26,739
And instead of wafting easterly

308
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,349
toward our neighbors
in Woodbridge,

309
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:32,051
the smell seems to have
settled on Stars Hollow.

310
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,055
Now, there's no telling
how long it will last.

311
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,970
What?! People are
suffering here.

312
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:40,896
How long does it take to pick
up a few measly pickles?

313
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:45,478
Picking up the pickles is not
my main concern at the moment.

314
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:48,968
Now, this is a matter
of pride, people.

315
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,357
A huge principle is at stake.

316
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:54,042
There's absolutely no reason
why we here in Stars Hollow

317
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:56,519
should take responsibility
for this mess.

318
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,864
The pickles themselves
hail from Ohio.

319
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:02,444
The railroad company is incorporated
in the state of Delaware.

320
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,012
And since all the pickles are on
the Woodbridge side of the tracks --

321
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,966
Just pick up the damn
pickles, Taylor!

322
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:11,937
Easier said than done.

323
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:14,232
Even if we wanted to
do the wrong thing

324
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:17,762
and assume fiscal
responsibility for this fiasco,

325
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:20,367
the cost is astronomical.

326
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:23,274
- $2,500 for --
- Sold!

327
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:25,366
- Done!
- Pay, you big cheapskate!

328
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:27,112
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

329
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:29,939
All those in favor
of Stars Hollow

330
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:33,756
taking a swift kick to the tush
and shouldering the entire cost --

331
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,581
- Aye!
- Aye!

332
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,901
Very well.

333
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:39,397
Motion carried.

334
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:42,476
Pickle smell gone
in 48 hours...

335
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,535
along with everything
good about Stars Hollow.

336
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:51,881
Breathe that in.
Isn't that fantastic?

337
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,270
Forgot what fresh,
pickleless air smells like.

338
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:56,400
Oh, so, you coming over to my
neck of the woods for lunch

339
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:59,450
is really no reflection on how
desperately you needed to see me?

340
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:03,765
Hmm...10% desperate need to see you,
90% pickles.

341
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,287
You know, I'm actually looking
forward to friday night dinner.

342
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:08,361
Because, as you well know,
the Gilmore house,

343
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:11,208
like very expensive vodka,
is completely odorless.

344
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,684
And you still want
me to come with?

345
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:14,623
Yes, you, me, Rory,
numbers, babe.

346
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:18,268
G.G., no. Skirt down! G.G.!

347
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,825
You may want to look into
the whole skort concept.

348
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,080
Hey, so,
I spoke with Sherry this morning.

349
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,645
Oh, yeah.
What's the deal with her?

350
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:27,732
Well, first she and G.G.
spoke for almost half an hour.

351
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:29,640
That's as long as you can
do anything when you're 4.

352
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:32,145
And then she and I talked.
I thanked her for the letter.

353
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:33,561
She said everything
in it was true.

354
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,093
She's totally serious
about this new life thing.

355
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,321
No more workaholic ways.

356
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:39,778
She's gardening and meditating,
all kinds of stuff.

357
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,828
She's very self-actualized --
her words, not mine.

358
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:43,998
Good for her.

359
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,740
And the big news is,
she wants me to send G.G. to Paris

360
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:48,477
to stay with her for
a couple of months.

361
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,066
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

362
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,516
I mean,
I know it seems kind of sudden,

363
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:53,961
but Sherry's taken this huge
leave of absence from work,

364
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:56,417
and G.G. got so excited.
I mean, why not, right?

365
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:58,132
She's not in school,
yet, just preschool,

366
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,841
and she needs to get to
know her mother sometime.

367
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:02,824
No, hey!
G.G., that's too high! Careful!

368
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:07,358
So, what --
would you go to Paris with her?

369
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,230
No, I was thinking the
nanny could take her.

370
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:10,264
She's dying to go.

371
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,443
I mean, it's Paris, right?
She's 25 years old.

372
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:14,121
It's a chance of a lifetime.

373
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:16,423
Yeah, sure.

374
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:18,878
No, hey!
G.G., no, don't pick that up!

375
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:20,095
I'll be right back.

376
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:26,305
You can't put Paris in charge.

377
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:27,503
She can and she should.

378
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:29,382
Guys, I just need someone to
get the paper out tonight.

379
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:31,445
Doesn't matter who.
I want the chain of command to be clear.

380
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:34,445
When the editor in chief isn't here,
the managing editor's in charge.

381
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:37,383
That's standard operating procedure
at every newspaper in the country.

382
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:39,367
Yes, but I've done
this 1,000 times,

383
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:40,681
and you've never done it, Bill.

384
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:41,734
Experience.

385
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:43,539
Experience that
led to a mutiny.

386
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:46,590
It's not like anyone ever gave Captain
Bligh another ship after the Bounty.

387
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:48,334
Of course they did,
multiple ships,

388
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:50,836
and by the time he died,
they promoted the guy to rear admiral.

389
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:53,511
Do you think the british royal navy
ruled the world in the 19th century

390
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:55,996
by letting that much natural
talent and leadership capability

391
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:57,867
go to waste just because
a few whiny complainers

392
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:59,880
wanted more breadfruit
and less scurvy?

393
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:01,962
Tell me you're not
seriously considering this.

394
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:04,080
The bunker.
Do you not remember the bunker?

395
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,364
I hardly see how my choice
of workplace is relevant.

396
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:09,337
There was an insurrection,
a revolt, an uprising.

397
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,449
She was deposed.

398
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:11,975
See how wordy he is?
He overwrites.

399
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,989
Plus, he's always been
weak with gerunds.

400
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,054
Sorry.

401
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,506
Look, could you guys take
this somewhere else?

402
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,127
Fine. Let's go to my desk.

403
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:22,179
Your desk? Right, like I'm actually
going to cede home-court advantage.

404
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:23,538
Oh, for god's sake.

405
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,872
Hey!

406
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:26,023
We did it, Ace!

407
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,531
- We bought the company!
- What?

408
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:29,120
It's crazy.
We were just supposed to have breakfast.

409
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,585
Next thing I know, we're sitting there
with lawyers going over contracts.

410
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:33,927
- Logan, that's amazing.
- I know!

411
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,883
Was it all because of my
breakfast-combo idea?

412
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:37,705
I'm pretty sure that's
what sealed it.

413
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,259
So, will you come
celebrate with me tonight?

414
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:41,888
- I already cleared my schedule.
- Great! I'll send a car.

415
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:44,140
Tonight, you'll be dining
with a captain of industry.

416
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:45,674
Wow, do you get to
wear a uniform?

417
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,630
I'll have to check the fine print.
Go home, get dressed.

418
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:48,484
I'll see you soon.

419
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,819
Aye-aye, captain.

420
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:52,667
Cancel? Well,
I would say that depends.

421
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:54,871
What exactly is your
feeling about pickles?

422
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:56,568
Uh-huh, yes, pickles --

423
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,476
gherkins, dills.

424
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:01,430
For instance, if all the air
around you smelled like pickles

425
00:17:01,444 --> 00:17:03,626
and there was no place to run,
no place to hide,

426
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:05,496
would you find that bothersome?

427
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:07,043
Michel, help. Let me in.

428
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:09,315
No, that is not a metaphor.

429
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:12,471
Yes, perhaps it would be better
if you checked in tomorrow night.

430
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,870
Uh-huh. Goodbye.

431
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:17,139
Michel, it's getting in my pores!
My pores are pickling!

432
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,159
Sorry, I didn't mean to
get you out of surgery.

433
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:22,953
Oh, mock the mask if you wish.

434
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:24,210
Oh, I will.

435
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,124
One is never too careful with
toxic pollutants in the air.

436
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,514
- Michel, it's just pickles.
- Oh, so they say!

437
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:31,767
Has anyone ever
seen these pickles?

438
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:34,038
Who's to say this is not
some sort of chemical weapon

439
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:35,984
the government is testing
on us behind our backs?

440
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,116
That's a cheery thought.

441
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,360
I have much scarier scenarios
if you want to hear them.

442
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:40,955
Yeah, maybe later.

443
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,390
Hey.

444
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:45,750
Wow, the smell is amazingly
not terrible in here.

445
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:46,687
What'd you do?

446
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,635
Well, after the town meeting,
I decided to make

447
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:51,052
some baked apples with
cinnamon and nutmeg.

448
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:54,082
- This is apples and cinnamon?
- Mnh-mnh. The apples failed me.

449
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:56,193
I mean,
a terrifically famous smell, right?

450
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,735
A powerful tool in the hands
of a real-estate agent.

451
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,334
Against the pickles
-- powerless.

452
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,677
What is it? It makes me happy.

453
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:05,209
The apples failed. I tried
cheeses and breads and chocolates.

454
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,355
But nothing could mask
the power of the pickles.

455
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:08,853
You know,
I think my sense of smell is ruined.

456
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,203
The insides of my
nose are burned out.

457
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,623
Then, I decided if you can't beat them,
join them.

458
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,068
Embrace the pickle!

459
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:15,288
Milton Berle it smells like?

460
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,387
Milton Berle? Are you saying my
kitchen smells like Milton Berle?

461
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:20,007
Milton Berle,
"Broadway Danny Rose", "Carnegie Deli".

462
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:23,073
- Pastrami.
- Pastrami!

463
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,437
You want a sandwich?
I'll make you a sandwich.

464
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,578
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

465
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:28,896
I've got pumpernickel. I've got rye.
I've got this really nice mustard.

466
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,198
I've even got Dr.
Brown's cel-ray soda in the fridge.

467
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,443
Nah, I filled up on lunchables
in the park with Chris and G.G.

468
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:34,966
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

469
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:35,886
Lunchables, huh?

470
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,497
Don't judge what you
do not understand.

471
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:40,118
So, friday afternoon in the
park with Christopher, huh?

472
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,142
Yeah. You know,
I think I will have one.

473
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,481
Soda that tastes like vegetables --
who would have thunk it?

474
00:18:44,513 --> 00:18:46,668
Hey, uh,
this kind of weird thing happened today.

475
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:47,338
Oh yeah?

476
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:50,187
So, apparently Sherry is trying to
get back in touch with Christopher.

477
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,655
Sherry "ex-wife" Sherry?

478
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,857
Sherry "abandoned her baby to go live
the life of a bon vivant" Sherry?

479
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:56,652
The very one.
She wrote him a letter -- "Mea culpa."

480
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:58,511
Mea culpa,
she's learned the error of her ways.

481
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:00,258
She wants to get back
in touch with G.G.

482
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:01,876
Translation --
she wants to get back with Christopher.

483
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,364
No, I don't think so.
She's dating someone.

484
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,838
She's doing downward dog with
some french yoga instructor.

485
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,810
Sherry "mani/pedi twice a
week" Sherry is doing yoga?

486
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:10,546
Allegedly. Who knows?

487
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:14,661
But then Chris went on about sending
G.G. to Paris with this 20-year-old nanny

488
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:16,752
so that G.G.
can reconnect with her mom.

489
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:19,036
- And you told him that's insane.
- No.

490
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:20,781
- What? Why not?
- I don't know.

491
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,342
Not saying what I think is not what
I'm known for, if you know what I mean.

492
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:26,064
No, no, I don't,
it's not what you're known for.

493
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,584
It's what you're not known for.
I mean, it's not what you're not --

494
00:19:30,364 --> 00:19:32,587
- You're usually quite frank.
- I know.

495
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,185
It sounds like you're not quite
comfortable talking to Christopher.

496
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,408
- That's the thing. I am.
- Well, then why didn't you?

497
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:39,231
Because in my head,
I wasn't talking to Christopher.

498
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:42,013
In the park, I was talking to Christopher,
but in my head, I was talking to Luke.

499
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,198
Oh, honey, of course you were.

500
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:47,181
No, I don't mean it like I missed him.
I mean it like

501
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:50,444
Luke is the one who didn't want me
getting involved in his kid's life,

502
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:51,384
not Chris.

503
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,548
Chris is open to what I think.
Chris is open to me.

504
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:56,063
Christopher is not Luke.

505
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:57,465
Nope, Christopher is not Luke.

506
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,316
Why aren't all nutritious
things in soda form?

507
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:00,812
That's a good question.

508
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,334
I swear I would eat my vegetables
if only they were fizzy.

509
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:04,955
Yay, Rory! Hello?

510
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:06,048
Hey, what's going on?

511
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,003
Uh, well Stars Hollow
smells like pickles.

512
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:08,980
- Pickles?
- Pickles.

513
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,351
- Pickles pickles?
- Pickles.

514
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,044
Why?

515
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,682
Because a pickle train crashed.

516
00:20:12,697 --> 00:20:15,599
Is this a joke? Is this a long,
boring joke that I'm not going to get?

517
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:17,258
No, it's no joke.
The town smells like pickles

518
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,734
because a pickle
train was derailed.

519
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:21,045
A train full of pickles?
Who knew there was such a thing?

520
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,473
Well, pickle-train conductors, for one.
Sounds so fun.

521
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:25,142
I would've been the greatest
pickle-train conductor.

522
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,729
Can you see me --
"All aboard, you pickles!"

523
00:20:27,744 --> 00:20:29,321
Hmm. Clearly you
missed your calling.

524
00:20:29,337 --> 00:20:31,182
Well, luckily there's you.
You're young, you're clever,

525
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,301
your great pickle-train
conducting hope.

526
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:34,617
I can't believe
I'm missing this.

527
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,574
Well, you can celebrate next
year on the anniversary.

528
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:37,704
What's going on with you?

529
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,304
Well, I can't make it to
friday night dinner tonight,

530
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,702
but I have a very good excuse.

531
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,055
Pickle-train
conducting seminar?

532
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:44,925
- Logan's in town.
- No way!

533
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,143
Yeah, he showed up last night.
It was a total surprise.

534
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:49,098
I can't believe you let me go on
about pickle-train conducting

535
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,334
- when you had actual news.
- You had news.

536
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:52,926
Stars Hollow smells
like pickles.

537
00:20:52,939 --> 00:20:56,503
I can completely see that
scrolling along the CNN crawl.

538
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:58,380
Logan in town is
totally pre-pickle news.

539
00:20:58,395 --> 00:20:59,906
How long is he here for?

540
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,862
6 1/2 more hours.
He flew in yesterday, bought a company,

541
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,682
- and he's flying back out tonight.
- Oh, my god.

542
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:06,899
What are you guys gonna do with
your precious remaining hours?

543
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,367
- Or don't I want to know?
- Mom!

544
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:11,194
Well, because you might be
farming rutabagas or something,

545
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,092
and I wouldn't want to
know 'cause -- boring.

546
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:15,768
Well, tonight I'm meeting him
in Manhattan to celebrate.

547
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:16,931
Fancy restaurant?

548
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,470
Rutabaga farm, actually.
Oh, but I'm sorry about dinner.

549
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:21,438
I did not mean to abandon
you in your time of need.

550
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,977
No worries. I'm not gonna be totally
defenseless. I'm bringing your dad.

551
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:25,543
Really? Wow!

552
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:27,622
Yeah, thought it was time
he meet the parents.

553
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:29,491
Okay, that is pre-pickle news,
my friend.

554
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:31,633
Oh, this conversation's been a disaster,
hasn't it?

555
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:32,954
- Yes, it has.
- All right.

556
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:34,968
Bring-bring. Hi, Rory.
How are you?

557
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:36,214
Hi, mom. Logan's in town.

558
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:38,134
Oh, my goodness.
That's wonderful.

559
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:39,389
We're farming rutabagas.

560
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:41,153
Oh, you're a filthy child.

561
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:43,254
I will disown you.
Bringing your father to dinner.

562
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,488
Pickles, pickles, pickles,
smell, pickle-train conducting.

563
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:46,995
- Alas, alack.
- Good talk.

564
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,683
- The best.
- Bye.

565
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,155
Good evening. Can I take that?

566
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:53,546
Thank you.

567
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,020
Um, I'm just meeting someone.

568
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:58,485
- Ahoy, my captain of industry!
- Ace!

569
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,736
Hey, where is your uniform?
I was expecting the whole works --

570
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:04,661
a spiffy hat, shiny shoes,
epaulets with scrambled eggs on them.

571
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:06,445
Scrambled eggs on my clothes?
What you must think of me.

572
00:22:06,478 --> 00:22:08,150
- You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

573
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:10,127
Though I was hoping you'd wear
a nice little sailor's middy.

574
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,245
- You look so cute in a middy.
- Oh, I'd love to wear a middy.

575
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,375
And a little sailor hat,
like the Stay-Puft marshmallow man.

576
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:16,782
Because who doesn't want to date
a giant humanoid marshmallow?

577
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:18,530
I'm so proud of you.

578
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,453
- Come on. Our table's over here.
- Okay.

579
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:24,618
Everybody, I'd like you to
meet my girlfriend, Rory.

580
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:26,267
Such a pleasure, Rory.
I'm Nick.

581
00:22:26,282 --> 00:22:27,429
- Hi.
- And this is Phillip.

582
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:29,203
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

583
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:31,352
And I'm Bobby.
So, so glad you could join us.

584
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:33,461
Bobby, um... yeah, me too.

585
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:35,697
I'm so glad I could make it.
How are you?

586
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:38,325
I'm brilliant, actually.
We had quite a day.

587
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,734
Shall we order another
bottle of champers, boys?

588
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:41,095
- Absolutely.
- Good. I'm parched.

589
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,847
- Do you drink?
- What? Um, yeah, sure.

590
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,361
Here. Sit, sit.

591
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:48,171
Oh, food. Let's please get food.
I haven't eaten since the waffles.

592
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:49,362
Dear god. Did you eat those?

593
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,340
It would have been rude not to.

594
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:51,873
You eat anything.
You astound me.

595
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:53,255
You're like a human
garbage disposal.

596
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,191
It's appalling, Phillip.
Really it is.

597
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:56,524
You know what you should do?
You should go on one

598
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:58,463
of those American
reality TV series

599
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,958
and showcase your talents.

600
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:02,462
There are these huge waffles
at the breakfast this morning.

601
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:04,351
And Phillip ate them.
I'm catching on.

602
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,510
Logan, I know
we're celebrating,

603
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:07,361
but I'm concerned about our
budget for this project.

604
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:09,875
From a strictly economic perpective,
do we really want to blow everything

605
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,399
on feeding Phillip tonight?

606
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,336
Somebody's got to
crunch the numbers.

607
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:14,891
It's true.
The numbers do not crunch themselves.

608
00:23:14,924 --> 00:23:17,721
Ergo, the number
cruncher must be fed.

609
00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:20,357
So, Rory,
I've heard so much about you!

610
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:20,941
Oh, yeah?

611
00:23:20,957 --> 00:23:22,516
Logan has talked my
ear off about you.

612
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:24,167
Oh, yeah, yeah. Me too.

613
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,437
He's talked my ear off
about you and all of you.

614
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:28,796
I mean, I'm practically Van
Gogh from my earlessness.

615
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:31,340
Did we order champagne, yet?
Logan, your girlfriend must be parched.

616
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:34,378
Oh, excuse me, miss. I think we'd
like another bottle, please.

617
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:36,075
Oh, and bring
another bread plate.

618
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:37,843
You're amazing.

619
00:23:37,857 --> 00:23:39,415
- Ridiculous.
- I'm hungry.

620
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:47,020
Oh, no.
You know my rule about hair bands.

621
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,949
My car, my tunes.

622
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:51,068
Really? You're
gonna say, "tunes"?

623
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:52,631
You got a lot of rules, lady.

624
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:55,479
Not a lot. It's just no saying
"killer," no saying "wack,"

625
00:23:55,495 --> 00:23:58,195
no saying "rockin'" or "pimping"
or "slamming," capisce?

626
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,353
Fo' shizzle.

627
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:01,119
There's got to be an eject
button here somewhere.

628
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:03,786
How's this for an idea --
weekend away, the two of us?

629
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,664
That's great for an idea.
Ooh! Ooh!

630
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,025
I know the perfect place.

631
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:09,768
Don't say "Dollywood."
Please, don't, don't say "Dollywood."

632
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,889
- The ice hotel.
- The what?

633
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:13,373
The ice hotel. It's amazing.

634
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:14,757
I read about it in
the travel section.

635
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,190
It's a hotel totally made of ice.
The roof is ice. The floors are ice.

636
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:20,156
The tables are ice. The chairs are ice.
Chandeliers are ice.

637
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,489
I think I'm beginning
to get the picture.

638
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:23,149
Wouldn't it be amazing if
you went down the hall

639
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:24,557
and the ice machine was empty?

640
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:25,918
It is amazing.

641
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,301
Amazingly cold.

642
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:29,699
No. You get to wear
parkas and fur hats.

643
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:30,457
"Get to"?

644
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,198
And you sleep under reindeer skins.
You eat reindeer meat.

645
00:24:33,212 --> 00:24:34,465
Again, "get to"?

646
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,345
You drink vodka.
That's a good "get to."

647
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,892
Hey, how's this for an idea?
We can drink vodka in Bermuda.

648
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:42,463
The ice hotel in Bermuda
would totally melt.

649
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:44,505
We'll do two weekends away.
First the ice hotel.

650
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:46,147
Then once we've been
treated for frostbite

651
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:47,900
and had our stomachs
pumped of reindeer meat,

652
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:50,010
we'll go defrost on
a beach somewhere.

653
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:53,156
I mean, we've got the time. G.G.'s gonna
be in Paris for a couple of months.

654
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:57,951
What? You're not down with
the whole beach thing?

655
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:02,440
No, it's...
more the whole Paris thing.

656
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:04,031
Yes?

657
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:09,797
I-I'm just... I'm not sure it's such
a good idea that G.G. goes to Paris.

658
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:11,264
Meaning?

659
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:13,430
Well, she's only 4 years old.

660
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:15,943
She barely even knows Sherry.

661
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:17,881
Yeah, but Sherry's her mother.

662
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:19,769
A mother she hasn't
seen in two years.

663
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:22,120
Look, Sherry's doing really well.
You read her letter.

664
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:24,240
And I think I've been doing
a really good job with G.G.

665
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:26,214
Oh, honey. Amazing.

666
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:27,354
But it's hard, you know?

667
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:30,375
It's -- It's really hard, and G.G.
needs her mom.

668
00:25:30,391 --> 00:25:32,237
And if I can help bring
them both back together,

669
00:25:32,252 --> 00:25:34,518
I want to do that.
I have to do that.

670
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,925
I know, I get that. I just --

671
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:39,124
I think maybe you should put
a little more thought into it,

672
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:41,730
you know, before you send
a toddler on an airplane

673
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:44,473
with an 18-year-old nanny who's
totally psyched to go to France.

674
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:47,122
- The nanny's 25.
- Oh, oh, okay, then.

675
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:49,018
Like the nanny's really
your problem here.

676
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:51,263
Well, I mean,
it's not an un-problem, you know?

677
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,327
I think you should just
consider it more carefully

678
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,775
or maybe go yourself.

679
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:57,096
- Look, I read her letter --
- Oh, my god! Enough!

680
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,127
Enough with the letter already.

681
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,117
I get it.

682
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:04,805
What do you get?

683
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,495
This is about you being
threatened by Sherry.

684
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:08,410
No, no. Give me a break.

685
00:26:08,425 --> 00:26:09,714
- You never liked her.
- No, I didn't.

686
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:11,903
But I don't like the new mailman either.
Doesn't mean I'm threatened by him.

687
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:14,319
That's not what this is about.
This is about me thinking I could speak

688
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:16,189
openly and honestly
about my concerns

689
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:17,821
without getting freaked out on.

690
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:19,325
Nice. Real nice.

691
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:20,554
Honey, what is
going on with you?

692
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:22,107
What's going on with you, Lor?

693
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:25,052
Look, can we drop this, please,
and try and have a nice evening?

694
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:26,442
It's dropped.

695
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:29,865
Well, hello, hello!
Richard, they're here.

696
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,475
Don't you two look marvelous?

697
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,855
Well, don't just stand there.
Come in, come in.

698
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:38,882
It was the way he kept saying
"intellectual property."

699
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:41,183
I could feel the whole deal just
slipping through our fingers.

700
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:43,580
He was like, "intellectual property.
Intellectual property."

701
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:45,633
"Which is like my property,
my property."

702
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,936
"I invented it, I invented it."

703
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,144
"We won't sell, we won't sell."

704
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,642
"And it's slipping. Slipping."

705
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:52,518
I'm looking at Nick trying to convey
through subtle dilations of my pupils

706
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:54,369
that we cannot offer
any more money.

707
00:26:54,382 --> 00:26:56,460
And I'm looking at Phillip
who's looking at me like,

708
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:58,695
like he's hopped up on some
sort of methamphetamine.

709
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:02,349
Slipping, slipping, and it looks
like we lost him, and then Bobby.

710
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:04,792
- Bobby makes a bold choice.
- What does she do?

711
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:06,145
- She just stands up.
- She does.

712
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,891
- She just stands up!
- Wow.

713
00:27:07,905 --> 00:27:09,762
She stands up like she can't
take it anymore, and she says,

714
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,323
"meeting's over, boys."

715
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,663
- That must have been crazy.
- It was amazing.

716
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:16,255
I'm sitting here, and she's here,
and she stands up.

717
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,653
And I look over,
and all I see is legs, legs, legs

718
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:21,280
and this look on her
face like "ohh, no."

719
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:23,266
It was brilliant.
Do it, Bobby. Stand up.

720
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,385
- Knock it off.
- Come on, Bobby. You got to see this.

721
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:26,978
- But we insist.
- Please?

722
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:29,289
Fine. But just to
shut you lot up.

723
00:27:29,302 --> 00:27:31,588
I suppose it was
something like, um...

724
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,435
...meeting's over, boys.

725
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:38,235
Whoo! Well done!

726
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:40,604
- Amazing, huh?
- We need another bottle!

727
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,010
And dessert. Don't we need
a little sweet or something?

728
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:45,341
So, Rory, we've barely had the
opportunity to speak all night.

729
00:27:45,376 --> 00:27:47,252
- I know.
- How's school? What's your major?

730
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,522
- English.
- Oh, god, how fantastic.

731
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,910
I swear when I was at Oxford,
I did nothing but read literature.

732
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:53,350
It was such a luxury.

733
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:56,036
- That's one way to look at it.
- Oh, I long for those days.

734
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,134
Just reading books, thinking.

735
00:27:58,148 --> 00:28:00,187
- I do like thinking.
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

736
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:02,478
Before you know it, you'll be out in
the real world with the rest of us.

737
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,390
Seems like you manage
to have some fun.

738
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:07,791
Well, Logan is a big part of that.
He is such a laugh.

739
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:10,190
He's actually a lot more
serious than you might think.

740
00:28:10,204 --> 00:28:13,155
It probably takes a long time to
get to know that side of him,

741
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,255
the serious side.

742
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:16,540
Oh, you two are so adorable.

743
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:18,102
- Thanks.
- Hey, not so fast!

744
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:19,616
We're still working on
getting the next round.

745
00:28:19,652 --> 00:28:21,336
Another sloe gin fizz, please.

746
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:22,928
Oh, and don't get
too excited, fellas.

747
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,461
I'm just going to the loo.

748
00:28:24,476 --> 00:28:27,033
- Yes! That's it!
- Amazing! Magnificent!

749
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:29,228
- We fold, we fold.
- Thank you, thank you very much.

750
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:32,931
And feel free to say all sorts of
cheeky things about me while I'm gone.

751
00:28:32,955 --> 00:28:34,721
Isn't she a riot?

752
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:36,277
Hilarious.

753
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:39,633
Well, naturally I thought they
were referring to the archduke.

754
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:41,494
So I jumped in,
as who wouldn't?

755
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:43,778
With some thoughts about the
various conspiracy theories

756
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:47,192
surrounding his infamous
assassination in Sarajevo.

757
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:49,405
Imagine my surprise when I
learned that Franz Ferdinand

758
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:52,561
was the name of a very
popular rock-'n'-roll band.

759
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,684
That's what he gets for trying to
fraternize after class with his students.

760
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,265
One of them even offered
to burn a CD for me.

761
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,768
So, tell me.
How are the salads?

762
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,757
Good, mom.

763
00:29:02,768 --> 00:29:04,346
- I like the pear.
- Do you?

764
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,525
- I'm so glad.
- Tastes very fresh.

765
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,084
Well, pears this time of
year can dress up any salad.

766
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,157
Oh, Richard,
did you tell them about midterms?

767
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:13,198
Lorelai, did your father
mention midterms?

768
00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:15,215
No, he didn't.
How were midterms, dad?

769
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:17,927
As you know, midterms separate
the wheat from the chaff.

770
00:29:17,942 --> 00:29:20,307
although I don't have to grade
any of their papers or tests.

771
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,195
They have these marvelous
teaching assistants

772
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,449
that handle all that
sort of things for you.

773
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:26,051
Thank you, Hildegard.

774
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,682
Christopher, I hope
you like lamb.

775
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:29,581
When I found out that you were coming,
I decided we had to serve

776
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:32,382
something special.
And to me, special means lamb.

777
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:35,045
Oh, it just makes me so happy to see
the two of you sitting here together.

778
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:36,320
It's such fun.

779
00:29:36,336 --> 00:29:37,904
It's very nice to be here.

780
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,726
- Tennis!
- Emily?

781
00:29:39,741 --> 00:29:41,827
That's one of the things we
can do together as a foursome,

782
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:44,053
now that Lorelai and
Christopher are an item.

783
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:46,556
That's right.
We do need new people for doubles.

784
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,568
We've been playing with
that awful Bunny Ferguson

785
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:50,258
And her husband,
whatever his name is.

786
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:51,198
They are dreadful.

787
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,373
The way Bunny Ferguson
grunts -- oh!

788
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:55,626
I mean, it's one thing
if you're Maria Sharapova

789
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:58,861
and you're 120 pounds and
a 7-foot blond teenager.

790
00:29:58,874 --> 00:30:01,372
- But if you're 5'3"...
- And 53...

791
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:02,745
And wearing plaid --

792
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:04,950
Did you see that skirt she wore
the last time we played them?

793
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:06,482
I can only think
that it was designed

794
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,354
to cause some sort of
optic misfunction.

795
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,242
Then you'll play with us?

796
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:11,393
Lorelai?

797
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,639
Hmm? Yes, fine, great.

798
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:13,600
It's a date.

799
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:16,219
How does the saturday after
next work for everyone?

800
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:17,332
Sure.

801
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,758
Ah, here's the lamb.

802
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:21,511
You do like lamb, Christopher?
I'm afraid I never let you answer.

803
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:24,043
I do. The funny thing is,
I never did when I was a kid,

804
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:27,449
but I do now. I guess I've changed.
People do that sometimes.

805
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:28,601
That's so true.

806
00:30:28,614 --> 00:30:31,400
What a clever observation.
It's like you and radishes.

807
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:32,092
Exactly.

808
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:34,277
Your father used to hate radishes.
Thought they were disgusting.

809
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:36,492
Well, they are roots.
It's a little unappealing.

810
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:38,718
And then one summer in Aspen,
he fell off a horse,

811
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:41,776
and suddenly he loved radishes.
That whole summer, he was radish-crazy.

812
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:44,316
It's true.
I do like radishes to this day.

813
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:46,112
- That's funny.
- Isn't it?

814
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:47,762
Yes. I don't like radishes.

815
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:49,966
I guess it's because I
find them threatening.

816
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,244
What a peculiar thing to say.

817
00:30:51,257 --> 00:30:53,025
Radishes are a peculiar topic.

818
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,282
All right.

819
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:56,286
Since this is a special
occasion of sorts,

820
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,366
I should like to
propose a toast.

821
00:30:58,382 --> 00:31:00,133
To many more nights like this,

822
00:31:00,147 --> 00:31:01,994
and to Lorelai and Christopher.

823
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:05,099
Who knew 20-some-odd years ago
that we would be making dates

824
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:06,844
- to play doubles tennis?
- And bridge.

825
00:31:06,861 --> 00:31:08,706
You absolutely have to
join us for bridge.

826
00:31:08,722 --> 00:31:11,813
You two have come a long way since
your days of rebellious youth,

827
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,906
shall we say?

828
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:14,652
Derelicts. The
word is derelicts.

829
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:15,802
Emily!

830
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:18,020
To Lorelai and Christopher.

831
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:24,358
They were derelicts. It's true.

832
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:27,879
Remember when they stole that bottle of
wine you'd been saving for 15 years?

833
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,764
Well, 10 years.
It was a '75 Margot.

834
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:32,636
And they had no idea
how to use a corkscrew,

835
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:34,427
so they just cracked
the top off with a brick

836
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:36,240
and slurped what they
could off the patio.

837
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:37,563
And look at them now.

838
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:40,613
All grown up and drinking
very nicely out of glasses.

839
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:42,243
I need to see you
in the bathroom.

840
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:43,510
Fine.

841
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:44,710
Excuse me.

842
00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:54,960
Would you mind telling
me what the hell --

843
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:56,312
- You're not Sherry.
- Excuse me?

844
00:31:56,327 --> 00:31:57,762
You've changed, Chris.

845
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:58,922
What are you talking about?

846
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:00,676
Maybe we were
derelicts back then.

847
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:02,721
But we were 16.
We were just kids.

848
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:04,138
- You were just a kid.
- So?

849
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:07,436
So, you leaving Rory when you
were 16 is not at all the same

850
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:10,448
as Sherry, a grown woman,
packing up and living G.G.

851
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,954
So I get why you
were upset with me.

852
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:15,042
Because when I'm criticizing Sherry,
you feel like I'm criticizing you.

853
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,656
But I wasn't. I'm not.

854
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,359
You've changed. You're not 16.
You're not a kid.

855
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:20,710
You're not Sherry. I get it.

856
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:22,762
Wow, you get it.
That's great, Lor.

857
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:25,572
Thanks for telling
me how I feel.

858
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:35,797
- Tired?
- I'm good.

859
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,860
I could always have the car
come pick us up at the corner.

860
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:39,926
I'm fine.

861
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:41,718
Hey, I know. I could carry you.

862
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:43,059
- Carry me?
- Yeah.

863
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:45,764
Piggyback, fireman's carry,
in both arms -- your choice.

864
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:46,914
No.

865
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,690
I'm really fine.

866
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:52,825
Wow, okay.
So, I guess something's really wrong.

867
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,820
Just because I don't want
to be fireman carried

868
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,409
doesn't mean that
something is wrong.

869
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:59,087
- But something is wrong.
- No, it's just --

870
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,756
Just?

871
00:33:01,535 --> 00:33:06,213
This isn't exactly what
I expected tonight.

872
00:33:06,228 --> 00:33:08,695
I was just a little confused,
I guess.

873
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,373
You called. You were so excited.
You said, "celebrate."

874
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:14,096
I thought it was
gonna be just us.

875
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,303
Last night was just us.

876
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:19,436
I know,
and it was also perfect and romantic.

877
00:33:19,452 --> 00:33:23,511
And the more I talk about it, the more
I feel stupid for even bringing this up.

878
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:25,939
Look, I'm sorry I wasn't
clear on the phone.

879
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,875
I'm sorry that you didn't
have a good time tonight.

880
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:31,482
Well, no, it's not that. I mean,
I get it. The guys are great. Okay.

881
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:36,113
But, technically Bobby, well,
she's not exactly a guy.

882
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:37,784
Yeah, you got me there.

883
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:41,159
And until about three hours ago,
I thought that she was a guy.

884
00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:42,127
You know why?

885
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:44,918
Because you never use personal
pronouns -- "She," "her."

886
00:33:44,932 --> 00:33:46,817
I mean, would that have been
so unbelievably difficult

887
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:48,476
to fit into a conversation?

888
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:52,179
I don't know about you, but most
of the Bobbys I know are guys --

889
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:56,285
Bobby Kennedy, Bobby Brady,
Bobby Knight, Bobby Brown.

890
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:58,355
You're smiling at me.
Why are smiling at me?

891
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,214
Because you are very cute
when you're jealous.

892
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:01,663
- I'm not jealous.
- Rory.

893
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,952
Oh, and it's not just that.
I mean, it was everything.

894
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:08,337
It was not feeling
like I was included.

895
00:34:08,353 --> 00:34:10,939
I mean, no one all night
asked me anything about me.

896
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:12,059
Bobby asked you about you.

897
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:14,084
Yeah, and how
condescending was she?

898
00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:16,643
"It's such a luxury
to read literature."

899
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:17,957
And did you hear
what she called us?

900
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:20,651
"Adorable." She called
us an adorable couple.

901
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:23,415
- Wait, she said that out loud?
- Yes, adorable.

902
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,113
Wow, you want me to go back
there and kick her ass?

903
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:27,806
"Adorable" is what you say
about a "Full House" rerun.

904
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:30,137
It's not what you say
about something that lasts.

905
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,556
The great wall of China, the pyramids --
no one ever called them "adorable."

906
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:36,312
And excuse me, but how many times does
a girl need to stand up at dinner?

907
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,317
Yes, you have legs. We get it.

908
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:41,088
"Oh, no, I'm not leaving.
I'm just going to the loo."

909
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:43,591
Here's a tip. You're in america now.
Speak english.

910
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:46,192
Okay, so just to clarify,
in the future, you would prefer

911
00:34:46,205 --> 00:34:47,956
I work only with girls
who have no legs.

912
00:34:47,971 --> 00:34:49,538
You're not taking me seriously.

913
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:51,082
Because you're
not being serious.

914
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:53,549
Bobby is my colleague.
She's great at what she does.

915
00:34:53,563 --> 00:34:55,973
She's smart. She's talented.
Nick has great legs, too.

916
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:57,890
Maybe before you rush to judgment,
you should check his out.

917
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:01,784
Great. So now I'm not just an idiot,
I'm an anti-feminist idiot,

918
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,404
an anti-feminist who's
standing here in the street

919
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:06,963
arguing about things I don't
really want to be arguing about.

920
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:07,913
- You don't?
- No.

921
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:09,948
Do you think I like
feeling this way?

922
00:35:09,962 --> 00:35:11,761
I mean, I haven't seen
you for months and months,

923
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:14,666
and now you're in town for what?
26 hours?

924
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,414
And in that time, I can't just get
happy and act like a fruit fly?

925
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,623
Mayfly.

926
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,307
I can't just live in the moment and
enjoy the 26 great hours ahead of me?

927
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:26,183
I have to be sulky and miserable
while all the other fruit flies

928
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:28,390
share private jokes
with my boyfriend?

929
00:35:28,404 --> 00:35:30,507
You think I like this
about myself? Wrong.

930
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:32,035
I hate myself for
being this way.

931
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,421
I hate Bobby for her
professionally tweezed eyebrows

932
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:38,045
and her oh-so-incredible ability
to stand up at a moment's notice.

933
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,388
And most of all,
I hate the fact that in a few seconds

934
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,591
you'll be in that
car leaving me again.

935
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,785
That is a hell of a long way to
go just to say, "I miss you."

936
00:35:45,802 --> 00:35:47,380
Any thoughts in response?

937
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:49,306
I miss you, too, Ace.

938
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,911
Five words.
You only used five words.

939
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:54,839
Yeah, well, I'm not done yet.

940
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:04,327
Of course, this time of year,
so many people start playing

941
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,961
that awful winter tennis with the
chicken-wire cages and the heated courts.

942
00:36:07,976 --> 00:36:10,244
Platform tennis can be
very enjoyable, Emily.

943
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:13,258
Yes, but it looks ridiculous,
like glorified ping-pong.

944
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:15,835
If I wanted to play ping-pong,
I would --

945
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:18,635
Well, if I wanted to play ping-pong,
I would kill myself.

946
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:21,330
Well, I hope you're still good
with a racket, Christopher.

947
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,770
Lorelai was always hopeless.

948
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:25,933
As a child, we took her to an
ophthalmologist to test her
depth perception.

949
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:27,968
He could find no
rational reason for it.

950
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,291
I know I'm not Sherry.

951
00:36:29,307 --> 00:36:31,891
I'm sorry. Did he serve you Sherry?
Richard, there's been some mistake.

952
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,522
Christopher's drink was
supposed to be port.

953
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:35,151
Come to Paris with me.

954
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:36,637
- What?
- You were right.

955
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,834
I should take G.G.
myself, check everything out.

956
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:39,973
Check what out?

957
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,094
Paris. I think they want
to check out Paris.

958
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:44,338
Come on. You can't say "no." I mean,
you can, but don't.

959
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:48,300
Maybe there's even a Parisian
ice hotel we can stay in.

960
00:36:48,312 --> 00:36:50,774
Yes. I mean, no,
there is no ice hotel.

961
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:52,701
But I'll stay in one
made of stone or bricks

962
00:36:52,717 --> 00:36:54,349
or whatever Paris
hotels are made of.

963
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:57,007
We can blast the air-conditioning
and drink all the vodka you want.

964
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:59,154
- What on earth --
- That sounds great.

965
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:01,075
What happened when you
went to the powder room?

966
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:02,560
One minute,
we're sitting here having dessert.

967
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:03,998
And the next,
you're talking about Paris.

968
00:37:04,031 --> 00:37:06,300
Well, Chris and I
are going to Paris.

969
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:07,690
In just a couple of
weeks, actually.

970
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:10,357
I'm so sorry we're gonna have to take
a rain check on that tennis date.

971
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:13,426
Yeah, till the 12th of never 'cause we
wouldn't play tennis or golf or bridge

972
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,776
or any game that could be
played in a foursome --

973
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:17,617
except hangman and
sometimes pictionary.

974
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:20,226
What has gotten into you?
You were being so pleasant all evening.

975
00:37:20,242 --> 00:37:22,699
Mmm, what is this?
This looks good.

976
00:37:22,716 --> 00:37:25,760
"What is it"? I told you 20 minutes ago.
It was rhubarb pie.

977
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:27,667
Hmm. Is it still rhubarb pie?

978
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:30,028
I swear I was having
the most wonderful time.

979
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,495
Is rhubarb a root, dad?

980
00:37:31,507 --> 00:37:32,578
No.

981
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:34,641
- Hi, everyone.
- Honey!

982
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,566
- Hey.
- Am I late?

983
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:39,041
Of course not, Rory.

984
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,470
You're just in time
for rooty rhubarb pie,

985
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:44,568
and for the viewing
of mom's mug shot.

986
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:45,581
Rory, stop her.

987
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,173
I'm sure you look
very nice, grandma.

988
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:48,796
You are very photogenic, Emily.

989
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,500
Ooh! What am I saying?
I have pictures on my phone.

990
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:53,228
Gather 'round the
phone, everybody.

991
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:54,626
Richard, what are you doing?

992
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:56,026
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

993
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:59,816
Oh! These new
phones are amazing.

994
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:01,859
Are those handcuffs?
Grandma, are you wearing handcuffs?

995
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,152
I certainly was not.

996
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:04,792
No, they gave her one of
those ankle things instead

997
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:06,510
with like a chain and
cannonball on the end.

998
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:07,391
Christopher!

999
00:38:07,406 --> 00:38:09,349
Oh, and the stripy outfit.
Tell Rory how they made you wear

1000
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:10,854
the stripy outfit, mom.

1001
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:15,534
No.

1002
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:20,511
No!

1003
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,663
- No!
- No!

1004
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,807
- Yeah, yeah, that one!
- Yeah! Stop there!
