1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,401
Previously on
"Gilmore Girls"...

2
00:00:01,411 --> 00:00:02,603
You are leaving for London.

3
00:00:02,613 --> 00:00:04,143
Who knows when we'll
see each other again?

4
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,765
The crazy thing is,
I am ready to get married.

5
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:07,753
Why are you doing this?

6
00:00:07,763 --> 00:00:08,466
Doing what?

7
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:09,806
Why are you taking
him away from me?

8
00:00:09,836 --> 00:00:11,864
What other reason is
there but to separate us?

9
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:13,492
- I don't want to wait anymore.
- I have April.

10
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:15,403
You're gonna have to figure out
how April fits into our lives.

11
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,479
Not the other way around.

12
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:18,423
- Just wait.
- No, I'm not waiting!

13
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:21,393
- It's now or never!
- I don't like ultimatums!

14
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:27,232
You okay?

15
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:28,790
I just don't want to be alone.

16
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:30,072
Come on in.

17
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:40,702
Hey.

18
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:42,161
Hey.

19
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:44,241
What are you doing?

20
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:48,131
Um... go back to sleep.

21
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:50,741
Come back to bed.

22
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:53,802
Oh, I can't. I got to go.

23
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:54,941
Stay.

24
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:57,542
No, I can't -- Paul Anka.

25
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:59,440
Oh, there's no way he's
performing this early.

26
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:00,313
Check your tickets.

27
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:01,750
No, I got to go
home and feed him.

28
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,351
Well, let me make
you breakfast first.

29
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,162
No.

30
00:02:04,186 --> 00:02:06,260
Come on, you're no good to Paul
Anka if you collapse from hunger

31
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:08,460
before you feed him. It's like how,
when you're on an airplane,

32
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:10,540
you put on your own oxygen
mask before your kids.

33
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:12,803
- It seems selfish, but --
- No.

34
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:17,961
Chris.

35
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:19,111
Lore.

36
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:20,433
Really.

37
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:21,942
You sleep.

38
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,350
I got to get going.

39
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,120
- You sure?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,010
Okay. Bye.

41
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,931
- You're back!
- Ohh! God, Babette, you scared me.

42
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,320
Yeah, it's my voice.
It frightens the hell out of people.

43
00:03:37,337 --> 00:03:38,571
I don't know what
to do about it.

44
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:41,110
Well, you could start by not
hiding in people's houses

45
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:42,650
and leaping at them
when they come home.

46
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,112
- It's the nodules.
- Who?

47
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,653
It's the nodules on
my vocal chords.

48
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,901
The more I strain my voice,
the more they grow.

49
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:50,552
It's nature's way of trying
to get me to talk softer.

50
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:52,020
Babette, one. Nature, nada.

51
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:54,192
I bet you're wondering
why I'm here.

52
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:56,792
Yeah. I mean, not that I'm not happy to
see you. It's just that I have to --

53
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:58,682
- I'm not a sleepwalker.
- No?

54
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,461
- In case that's what you were thinking.
- No no.

55
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:02,932
'Cause a lot of people figure
me for one, god knows why.

56
00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:05,622
- I guess I got the look.
- Well, you didn't sleepwalk, though.

57
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:08,453
Huh-unh. But this morning
I came over here wide awake

58
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:10,982
'cause I heard Paul Anka doing
that weird yodeling noise

59
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:12,862
that you said he does when he's hungry,
so I fed him.

60
00:04:12,896 --> 00:04:13,852
Oh good, thank you.

61
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:17,330
Yeah, I gave him a half a cup of
that kibble that you said he likes,

62
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:19,471
but then he looked at me like
I stole something from him,

63
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:20,660
so I gave him a whole cup.

64
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,531
I know that look.
It can be intimidating.

65
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:24,492
And since our washing
machine is broken --

66
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,213
Morey put his boots in
it and broke it again --

67
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:28,113
I thought I'd do a
load of my intimates.

68
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:29,083
Good for you.

69
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:30,931
- You ain't got any messages.
- What?

70
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,540
- He didn't call.
- Who?

71
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:34,703
I heard about the fight
between you and Luke.

72
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:35,822
You did?

73
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:38,610
Yeah. You know Adrian
Bittenberg's daughter, Becky?

74
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:39,803
She got a huge mouth.

75
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:42,670
- Becky is not a gossip.
- But she has a huge mouth.

76
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:45,812
And she and Eileen Whitewin
were behind Doose's market

77
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,462
seeing how many devil dogs
Becky could stuff in there,

78
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,141
and when she got up to four,
completely cut off her oxygen.

79
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:53,870
So Eileen went running over to Luke's
to see if she could get some help,

80
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:56,680
and then she saw the two of you in
the streets screaming at each other.

81
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:59,411
Well,  I'm glad she had the presence
of mind to listen in on our argument

82
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:00,931
while her friend was
choking to death.

83
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:03,551
Don't you worry about a thing, honey.
Everything will be fine.

84
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:05,962
Every couple needs a good
blowout once in a while.

85
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:08,221
- It keeps you on your toes.
- Oh, yeah, well...

86
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:11,482
Yeah. So, did you spend the
night at Sookie's again?

87
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:12,673
Sookie's?

88
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,022
Yeah, I figured you were there,

89
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:15,983
but Morey and I did a
power walk this morning,

90
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:18,723
and we went by her and Jackson's place,
and I didn't see your jeep there.

91
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:20,342
Babette, I really
got to get going.

92
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:22,871
Oh, I'm just waiting
for my panties to dry.

93
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,531
I'll pick them up later.

94
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:28,881
Okay, but could you do me a favor and
put them in a delicate-spin situation,

95
00:05:28,898 --> 00:05:30,823
30 minutes with a
bounce dryer sheet?

96
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,452
Oh, and don't worry, sweetheart.
He'll call.

97
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,222
They always do.

98
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:54,831
Do you want your kid to spend her life
behind the counter at Dunkin' Donuts?

99
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:55,672
- Do you?
- No.

100
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:56,972
Because that's where
she's headed --

101
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:59,820
selling chocolate donuts and glazed
fritters for the next 40 years

102
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:03,193
to people in business suits who actually
gave a crap about their academic future.

103
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:05,020
I just want her to get
into a good school.

104
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:06,490
She has such potential.

105
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:07,652
So did Charles Manson.

106
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,161
- What?
- Look at her.

107
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:11,170
Frankly, it may
already be too late.

108
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:14,523
I don't particularly like to take
on such meek, diffident cases.

109
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,771
Do you even know what
"diffident" means?

110
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:19,051
That's okay.
That knowledge isn't really required

111
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,193
in the retail
doughnut-distribution industry.

112
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,573
Please, just give her a chance.

113
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:24,112
- Why should I?
- Because she needs this.

114
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:25,632
- Mom.
- Caitlyn.

115
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,441
- What do you think?
- She's got a "C" average,

116
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:29,670
which means she's
either lazy or stupid.

117
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:30,810
I can work with either.

118
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,483
Frankly, sometimes
stupid is easier.

119
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:35,311
I can scare the stupid out of you,
but the lazy runs deep.

120
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,041
- So you'll take her on?
- I will.

121
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:38,160
- Wonderful.
- Mom!

122
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:41,011
Caitlyn. Thank you, Paris.
You won't be sorry.

123
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,441
Okay. Now, if I can get you both
to take these aptitude tests,

124
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:45,521
then we can get to work.

125
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,933
Why do I need to take a test?

126
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:49,480
I need to get a realistic sense
of Caitlyn's true potential,

127
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:51,961
and  genetics is by far the
most reliable indicator.

128
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:52,753
I'm sorry?

129
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:56,761
Basically,  I need to know how much of this
is her fault and how much of it is yours.

130
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:58,241
Ticktock.

131
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:01,943
What is this?

132
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:02,951
Pretty great, huh?

133
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,081
Not for Caitlyn.

134
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,322
I was gonna spend the summer
tutoring for the Princeton review,

135
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:09,102
but then I found they charge
these little morons $60 an hour

136
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:10,701
and only pay their tutors $20.

137
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,383
So I figured,
"who needs the Princeton review?"

138
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:13,783
I can open up my own shop.

139
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:16,141
I've already subcontracted out
to three other student tutors,

140
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:18,090
and I've got more
prospects lined up.

141
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:19,252
I'm gonna make a fortune.

142
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,711
Hey, are you interested?
The pay's $15 an hour.

143
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:22,553
No, thanks.

144
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:25,289
Wait. Are you looking to use
the offices over the summer?

145
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:27,173
Just because you're the editor,
that doesn't entitle you

146
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,873
to use the offices during the summer.
There's no paper to put out.

147
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:31,690
These were up for grabs,
and I grabbed them.

148
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:33,273
Paris, I don't
want the offices.

149
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:35,101
Oh. Then,
what are you doing here?

150
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:36,763
I just came in to
back up my files.

151
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:38,360
You already backed
up your files.

152
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,120
I saw you do it.

153
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:42,572
Oh. I get it.
Logan's gone, huh?

154
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,000
He left this morning, early.

155
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,691
- Breakups are tough.
- What?

156
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,542
Eyes on your own
paper, Marilyn!

157
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,151
- We didn't break up.
- You didn't?

158
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,441
No. Why would you say that?

159
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:54,582
I don't know. Wealthy, good-looking,
hedonistic heir to billion-dollar,

160
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:56,952
multinational media
conglomerate moves to London

161
00:07:56,968 --> 00:08:00,022
and spends nights pining away
for his college girlfriend?

162
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:01,631
Who's watching that movie?

163
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:03,530
Paris, it's not like that.
We're together.

164
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:04,723
So you guys talked about it?

165
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,283
Yes. Well, no --

166
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:10,662
I mean, I'm gonna go visit him, though.
We talked about that.

167
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:12,232
- When?
- I don't know exactly.

168
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:13,793
So what, specifically,
did you agree to?

169
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:17,200
Well, nothing, really,
but it was kind of understood.

170
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:19,811
Yeah. Because that worked
out so well the last time.

171
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:20,792
Paris.

172
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,170
Has history taught you nothing?

173
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:25,492
You're in limbo, sister,
no man's land, quite literally.

174
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:27,961
Logan is not that bright.
You need to spell it out for him.

175
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:29,702
He's got to know where
the red lines are,

176
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:32,933
or he's gonna leap right over them and
into bed with multiple british floozies.

177
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,730
Paris, it's okay.
Logan and I are fine.

178
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:37,733
He moved to London, Rory --
the most romantic city in the world.

179
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:39,471
Paris is the most romantic
city in the world.

180
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:42,730
Oh, right.
London is just the most sex-obsessed.

181
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,791
Pencil's down!

182
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:50,760
Hey.

183
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:56,413
I can't. I'm late for work.

184
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:57,281
Can we talk first?

185
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,420
Please, I really don't want to.

186
00:08:58,456 --> 00:08:59,491
Lorelai, come on.

187
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,940
No, Luke, we did talk.

188
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,540
We talked last night.
There's nothing left to say.

189
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:06,302
I'm sorry about yesterday, but you
kind of ambushed me, out of nowhere,

190
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:07,771
and then you didn't
give me a chance.

191
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:08,943
I gave you every chance.

192
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:10,403
You were going so fast.

193
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,590
Yeah, that's me. I'm fast.

194
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:13,623
I'm the perfect storm of
caffeine and genetics.

195
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,103
I know, but now I've had a chance to
catch up, and I want to discuss it.

196
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,362
Discuss what?
There's nothing left to discuss.

197
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:20,313
Us -- you and me.

198
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:23,621
There is no us.
There's you, and there's me. It's over.

199
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:26,132
It was over last night,
and it's over now. It's over.

200
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,632
- Lorelai --
- No, I'm sorry. I have to go.

201
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:43,233
- You're going down.
- No.

202
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:44,500
You think you're so great.

203
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:46,701
- You think you're miss la-di-da.
- Ow.

204
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:50,083
But look at you now,
all weak and pitiful.

205
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:52,413
That's it. Give in to the pain.

206
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,553
- So, how's my acting?
- What do you mean?

207
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:58,540
Well, is it believable, or do you
find it a little over-the-top?!

208
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:01,672
My fingers!
My fingers are smashed!

209
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,550
Ha! How do you like
them apples, Michel?

210
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,163
I do not like these apples.
You cheated.

211
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:06,793
You hustled me.
You played possum.

212
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:08,503
Oh, no, I played arm-wrestling.

213
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:10,052
Or did you think we were
playing some other game?

214
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:11,110
Is that why you lost so bad?

215
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:13,342
Your gloating is
very distasteful.

216
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:14,560
Ouch!

217
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:18,740
Lorelai, I may need to take some
time off to have my wrist x-rayed.

218
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:19,971
Excuse me.

219
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,472
I am the champion, my friend

220
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,471
And I'll keep on
fighting till the end

221
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:28,201
No time for losers

222
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:31,461
Oh! I am a
fantastic arm-wrestler.

223
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:33,563
You know what I think did it?
The whisking --

224
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:37,150
all those years of whiskin has given
me incredible forearm strength.

225
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,503
People are always like, "why take
the time to hand-whip fresh cream?

226
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,472
Why not use a machine?"

227
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:44,372
And I've always been like,
"I don't know why I do it.

228
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:47,432
It's just something that
I do." But now I know --

229
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:50,852
because I've been training
for this very day.

230
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:53,273
I mean, wow! I am strong.

231
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,932
And the omelet flipping
definitely is part of it.

232
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:59,203
You know when you use one of those
really heavy cast-iron skillets,

233
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:00,742
and you flip, flip?

234
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:02,802
I mean, that's all in the wrist,
you know?

235
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:04,311
And that's what they say.

236
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:06,393
You know, that's what people
say about arm-wrestling, too --

237
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:08,241
that  it's all in the wrist,

238
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:12,680
and, man, I have super-bionic,
superpowered, super wrists.

239
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:15,490
I mean,
who knew I possessed such --

240
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:16,873
Honey?

241
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,602
Something's wrong, huh?

242
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:19,381
Yeah.

243
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:21,503
It's not spiders
on the ceiling.

244
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,381
You know I hate spiders.

245
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,091
I was kind of hoping
it was spiders.

246
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,070
It's not spiders.

247
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:27,382
- No?
- No.

248
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,440
Okay.

249
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:29,901
Luke and I are over.

250
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:31,590
- Over?
- Yeah.

251
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:33,212
- No.
- Yeah.

252
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,492
- Have you guys had a fight?
- We had the fight.

253
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,942
People have fights. It's okay.

254
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:40,310
It's good, actually.
You know, it's healthy.

255
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:42,120
If you don't have fights,
all these bad chemicals build up,

256
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:44,152
and you get ulcers
and bad skin.

257
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,360
You got such pretty skin,
so you have to have some fights

258
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:47,760
for the sake of your skin.

259
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:49,263
This was different.
This was bad.

260
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,982
People have bad fights.

261
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:53,493
Every bad fight can
seem like "the fight."

262
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,812
It wasn't just a fight, Sookie.

263
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:58,750
It was him not fighting for me.

264
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:00,543
I gave him an ultimatum.

265
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:02,890
- And?
- And he let me walk away.

266
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:04,762
No. He'll come back.

267
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:06,672
He'll be back. He'll come back.

268
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,751
Luke wants to marry you.

269
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:10,413
I know he does.

270
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:13,342
I mean, he'll come around.
He'll get it together.

271
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:14,351
I'm done.

272
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:16,343
I don't want to see him anymore.
It's over.

273
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:18,423
I  get that you're mad.
You deserve to be mad.

274
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,661
Luke's been a real jerk.
Frankly, being mad at him

275
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:22,543
makes all the
sense in the world.

276
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:26,193
And if you're so mad that you need to
believe you guys are over, I get that.

277
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,112
Sookie, I spent the night
with Christopher last night.

278
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,950
You spent the night with
Christopher last night?

279
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:34,562
- Spent the night.
- With Christopher?

280
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:35,591
Yeah.

281
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:36,850
Okay. So, does Luke know?

282
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,951
No. I don't want
him to ever know.

283
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,283
That's good. That's good.

284
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,720
Uh, okay.

285
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:45,093
Uh, look -- things happen.

286
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:47,892
People... people do things.
It's not pretty.

287
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:50,033
It's not Disney,
but it's the real world.

288
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:51,502
And you don't have to tell him.

289
00:12:51,518 --> 00:12:54,180
Luke doesn't have to know,
and things don't have to be over.

290
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:57,011
No, you don't get it.
I need it to be over.

291
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:00,692
I need it to be over because
I can't take this anymore.

292
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,292
Yes, I love Luke, and, yes,
I wanted to marry Luke.

293
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:06,271
But I didn't want a life
separate from Luke,

294
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,841
and that's all he could give me.
I don't want that.

295
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:11,143
If I'm gonna be with Luke,
I want to be with Luke,

296
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:14,703
and he didn't get it, and I waited.
I mean, god, I waited.

297
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:16,972
It's like Luke is
driving a car, okay,

298
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:19,423
and I just want to be in
the passenger's seat.

299
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:21,203
But he's locked
the door, and...

300
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:24,100
and so I have to hold onto the bumper,
you know?

301
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,883
I'm not even asking him
to open the door for me.

302
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,631
Just leave it unlocked and say,
"come in."

303
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:30,842
But no, he didn't do that,
so I'm hanging onto the bumper,

304
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:32,612
and life goes on,
and the car goes on,

305
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,243
and I get really badly
bruised and hitting potholes.

306
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,123
And it hurts. I mean, it hurts.

307
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:42,750
So yesterday I had to let go of the
bumper because it hurts too much.

308
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:44,943
It hurts too much.

309
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:48,721
Okay.

310
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:56,111
- Caesar, where the hell is Lane?
- She's on her honeymoon.

311
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,491
- Jeez, how long is that gonna last?
- It's only been a week.

312
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,550
Only? Seven days seems
like plenty of time

313
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,020
to sit in some mountain cabin together
and realize you've just changed yourself

314
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:05,873
to another human being
for all eternity.

315
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:09,262
They went to Mexico, so they're
probably doing that on a beach.

316
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,722
Maybe it takes a little longer to realize,
you know, with the hot sun and all.

317
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,421
Ceasar, are you being funny?

318
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,292
- You tell me.
- No, you tell me.

319
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:17,280
- It would appear not.
- Bus those tables.

320
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:20,143
Luke, I asked for these eggs scrambled,
and they're sunny-side up.

321
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,982
There you go.

322
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:27,132
Oh, now what?

323
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:29,290
Caesar, I'll be right back.

324
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:32,822
Don't hurry.

325
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:36,460
Now, carefully. Carefully.

326
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,360
That's rental equipment.
I'm responsible for that.

327
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:39,492
Taylor, what the
hell are you doing?

328
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,972
Good morning, Lucas.
You look in fine fettle today.

329
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:43,671
Okay, whatever you're doing,
stop it.

330
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,850
That's rather cynical. Now, who's
to say I'm not doing something here

331
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:47,190
that will surprise
and delight you?

332
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:48,542
- Are you?
- I highly doubt it.

333
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:50,242
- Then stop it.
- Can't do it, Luke.

334
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,711
The safety of the citizens
of Stars Hollow is at stake,

335
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,390
and that has to be
my top priority,

336
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:56,811
regardless of how you feel
about a red-light camera.

337
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:57,752
A what?

338
00:14:57,768 --> 00:15:01,642
To catch scofflaws. Apparently, people
are viewing our traffic light here

339
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:04,360
as more a series of colorful
driving suggestions

340
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,012
rather than the
rules of the road.

341
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:09,031
Therefore, I decided to
install a red-light camera

342
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:12,051
to discourage drivers
who would test our laws

343
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:13,980
and photograph and
punish those who do.

344
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,080
A camera?

345
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:18,262
You run a red light, it's time
for your close-up, Mr. Demille.

346
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,391
These little wonders are
taking over the globe --

347
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:22,543
New York, Los Angeles,
Paris, Singapore.

348
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,462
That's ridiculous.

349
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,912
They're in position and ready for
the installation as you say so.

350
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,230
You can't do this.
It's an invasion of privacy.

351
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:29,382
Something to fear, Luke?

352
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:32,500
You can't take pictures of
people for driving by the diner.

353
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:34,000
It's probably not even legal.

354
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,691
Spoken like a man with
something to hide.

355
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:37,942
Luke, I can assure you that
I am well within my rights

356
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:39,903
as town selectman to
install that camera,

357
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,772
and you, of all people,
should be grateful.

358
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:44,581
After all, it'll make the street in
front of your diner that much safer.

359
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:45,911
Or unsafer,
if you know what I mean.

360
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,380
There hasn't been an accident
on that corner in 15 years.

361
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:50,692
And now we've made it safe
for the next 15. Hooray!

362
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:51,890
I'm gonna fight you
on this, Taylor.

363
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,923
We  will be having the official
unveiling ceremony later this afternoon.

364
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:56,050
You're welcome to attend.

365
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,891
I don't see how I can avoid it, considering
it's right in front of my damn diner!

366
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,960
I'll put you down for plus one.

367
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,912
Oh, and we're going to have to
cross up some electrical lines

368
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,243
during the
installation process,

369
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,643
so you might lose
power for a few hours.

370
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,151
Hi.

371
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:14,143
What?! The prodigal
daughter returns.

372
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:15,283
What are you doing here?

373
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,053
I couldn't stay away.
I just missed you too much.

374
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:20,140
Aren't you the sweetest?
Isn't she the sweetest, Michel?

375
00:16:20,157 --> 00:16:22,481
Beyond all human understanding.

376
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:23,943
Hi, Michel.

377
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:26,971
Yes, it hurts very much.

378
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,673
Yay! So you're back.

379
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:30,892
Yeah. I just had to
get out of there.

380
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,522
Aw. How was the goodbye?

381
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,542
Awful. There's nothing
good about a goodbye.

382
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:37,560
It's a very poorly named ritual.
It was a bad bye, a very bad bye.

383
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:39,782
Then I went to the newsroom
to talk to Paris about it --

384
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:40,753
You what?

385
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,623
Well, I didn't mean to.
She was just there,

386
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:45,420
and she spent 10 minutes
kicking me while I was down.

387
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,960
Paris is always there for you
in the most unfortunate ways.

388
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:49,231
I just miss him so much.

389
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,201
I know you do.

390
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,030
And it's only been seven hours.
Can you imagine when it's been --

391
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,382
You know what? I don't want to
talk about it. I need coffee.

392
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:57,953
Okay. You sure, though,
you don't want to talk?

393
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:01,201
You can always vent to me.
I'm the perfect vent-erizer --

394
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:02,822
vent-erator.

395
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:06,363
Mom, I don't need a vent-erator.
I just don't want to talk about it.

396
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:08,013
What's going on with you?

397
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,992
Oh. With me?
Oh, well, things with me --

398
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:12,653
things with me are good.

399
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,933
Convincing.

400
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,540
Things with me friends are good.
Things with me Inn are good.

401
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,342
- Things with me, not so good.
- What's up?

402
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:19,900
Look, I don't want to talk
about this right now, okay?

403
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:22,992
But I want to tell you. I have to tell,
but I'm barely holding it together as it is.

404
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:25,621
So if I tell you, will you
promise not to make me discuss it?

405
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:27,041
What?

406
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:28,723
Luke and I split up.

407
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:30,312
What do you mean,
like you got into a fight?

408
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:32,912
No, like we had a breakup,
like a real-life parting of the hearts.

409
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:34,230
Why? What happened?

410
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:35,650
Rory, you promised.

411
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,343
No, I didn't.

412
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,300
- Well, it was implied. Please.
- Mom.

413
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,511
Rory, I don't want
to talk about it.

414
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:42,040
- But you have to explain.
- No, not right now, okay?

415
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:44,223
Look --
you got to not talk about your thing.

416
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,400
So I didn't vent-erator you.
You don't vent-erator me.

417
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:48,971
- But --
- Rory, please.

418
00:17:49,855 --> 00:17:52,220
Well, you know, I guess we
don't have to talk about stuff.

419
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,183
Yeah. Who says we always
have to be talking?

420
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,492
We can not talk.

421
00:17:56,507 --> 00:17:57,701
Of course we can.

422
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:59,141
Okay.

423
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:01,401
We should probably talk about
how we're not gonna talk,

424
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,591
'cause I don't think we
should just go right into it.

425
00:18:03,606 --> 00:18:05,402
Let's do something that
doesn't require talking.

426
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:06,760
Like, we could go
to the movies.

427
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:08,182
You want to try not
talking at a movie?

428
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:09,361
- Okay, shopping.
- Are you mad?

429
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:12,401
We could drink. We could go to
a bar and just throw back a few.

430
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,300
Yeah, 'cause drunk people
never feel like talking.

431
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:15,923
Oh! We could go to a club.

432
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:18,130
Yeah, 'cause all the hot spots
get rolling right about lunchtime.

433
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,703
See? This is why
men play sports.

434
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:21,760
- Sports. We can play sports.
- We hate sports.

435
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:23,102
We haven't tried every sport.

436
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:24,090
How about running?

437
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:25,770
We could easily talk
while we're running.

438
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:27,212
Not if we were hurdling.

439
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:29,432
Hurdles require more focus and,
thus, less talking.

440
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:30,880
Or we could do that
kind of running

441
00:18:30,897 --> 00:18:34,450
that's like you leap around
a tree and up a hill --

442
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:35,882
You want to run cross-country.

443
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:37,980
Not across the whole country,
maybe just Michigan.

444
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,482
Michel, what sports
do you play?

445
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:42,240
Well, since I'm maimed
potentially for life,

446
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,193
I may never play sports again.

447
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,543
But think back to before this tragic,
life-altering injury,

448
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:50,260
when life was still worth living.
What sports did you play then?

449
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:52,221
Well, pilates, of course.

450
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:52,891
What?

451
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,480
It's like yoga with
cables and wires.

452
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:55,472
Sounds very dangerous.

453
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:58,223
Oh, racquetball is also
a fantastic workout.

454
00:18:58,235 --> 00:19:00,261
- Racquetball?
- Intriguing.

455
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:02,312
I always liked the
sound of racquetball.

456
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:04,030
Tell us more about
this racquetball.

457
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:05,823
Well, it's very simple --

458
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:08,742
a 4-walled room, a racquet,
and a rubber ball.

459
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,423
Get to the good part.
What are the clothes like?

460
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,712
Can we wear cute outfits?

461
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:12,381
I do.

462
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:13,752
I think racquetball
sounds great.

463
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,770
- Mmm, I'm in.
- Okay, good.

464
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:18,353
Go home. And I need to finish
up a few things around here.

465
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,372
I'll see you there
in about an hour.

466
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:20,331
Deal. Yeah, fun.

467
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:21,673
Okay. And no talking.

468
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:25,753
Except for smack talking because I am
so gonna kick your butt in racquetball.

469
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:29,192
No no, I mean, my balls -- they're gonna
bounce way further than your balls.

470
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:33,061
Okay, well,
you haven't seen my great top...

471
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,861
- flick wrist --
- We'll learn the terms.

472
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,542
Okay, go home and study.

473
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,543
- Hello?
- Miss me?

474
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:47,930
Logan, where are you?

475
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:49,172
Heathrow. I just landed.

476
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,053
- I miss you so much.
- I miss you, too.

477
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,503
I've been here 2 1/2 minutes,
and I can already tell it sucks.

478
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:55,552
It does suck.
I've heard that about London.

479
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:57,382
You should just get on
a plane and come home.

480
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,501
You gave it a chance.

481
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:01,032
Are you on campus? I tried you at the
apartment, but I didn't get an answer.

482
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:02,811
No, I'm back at Stars Hollow.

483
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,203
That apartment suddenly
felt very big and empty.

484
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:06,720
So, what are you gonna do with
your first day of freedom?

485
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,801
Oh, going to play
racquetball with my mom.

486
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:10,393
This is a really
bad connection.

487
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:12,742
It sounded like you were gonna
play racquetball with your mom.

488
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:15,342
Hey, I could have a hidden
talent for it, you never know.

489
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:17,622
- So did you open my gift?
- Of course.

490
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,240
What did you think?

491
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:21,751
I thought... wow.

492
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:23,500
Yeah, pretty cool, right?

493
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:24,740
So cool.

494
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:26,491
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

495
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,561
Like it? I love it.

496
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:29,771
I'm so glad you got it.

497
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:31,551
Oh, yeah, totally.

498
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:34,031
When I left, I suddenly got worried you
wouldn't get it. But of course you got it.

499
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,542
Yeah, of course.
Of course, I got it. I loved it.

500
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:37,802
I knew you would.

501
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:38,991
All right, Ace, I got to go.

502
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,900
I just wanted to tell you I
touched down. I'll call later.

503
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:43,191
Okay, bye. And thank you.

504
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,581
Of course.

505
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:52,270
Like a remote-control rocket?

506
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:54,212
No, like a model rocket.

507
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:55,872
How big?

508
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:58,653
Is it filled with anything?
Gum or candy or anything?

509
00:20:58,668 --> 00:20:59,370
Gum.

510
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,131
What? Rocket gum.
It could be a thing.

511
00:21:01,146 --> 00:21:02,463
There was no gum in it.

512
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:04,340
It doesn't have a
button you can push?

513
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:06,982
No, nothing like that.
It's just a model rocket.

514
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:09,280
I mean, what could that mean?
Who gives someone a rocket?

515
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:11,151
I don't know. I don't know.
We'll figure it out, though.

516
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,562
Rocket, rocket, rocket.
Rocket man -- "Rocket man."

517
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:18,902
"Crocodile rock" was good. "Bennie
and the jets," "Candle in the wind."

518
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,643
Are you just naming
Elton John songs?

519
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,252
He is just so talented.

520
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:24,340
Ugh. What about space?

521
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:25,983
It's the final frontier?

522
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:27,483
- Oh, no.
- What?

523
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,882
What if he was trying to say that
he wanted space away from me?

524
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:31,850
No.

525
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:35,423
Oh, hi, we're not done racquetballing.
We've got it for like an hour.

526
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:36,483
Thanks, though.

527
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:38,091
Hey, maybe it's code.

528
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:40,873
Like I'm his rocket, right?

529
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:42,902
Like I'm his rock, E.T.

530
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,302
I'm his rock in the
eastern time zone.

531
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,091
That's dumb.

532
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,040
Yeah, like rocket gum
is sweeping the nation.

533
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:50,881
When I have made $1 zillion

534
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,642
from my rocket-gum invention,

535
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:53,823
you will eat those words.

536
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:55,842
Or more likely,
chew those words

537
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,033
and blow a bubble with them,
'cause did I mention

538
00:21:58,046 --> 00:21:59,870
that rocket gum is bubble gum?

539
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,290
But instead of blowing bubbles,
it releases helium

540
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:04,502
that shoots the
chewer up into space.

541
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:06,591
I don't think this is
helping me understand

542
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:08,522
the state of my
relationship with Logan.

543
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,402
And we're not even
supposed to be talking.

544
00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:12,792
- You started it.
- I did start it.

545
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:15,712
So maybe now you would
like to talk about Luke?

546
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:17,790
You know what,
I'd rather racquetball.

547
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:18,672
Seriously?

548
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:19,963
Come on.

549
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:23,270
What do you think?

550
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:24,292
Against the wall?

551
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,521
- Yeah, why not.
- Okay.

552
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:27,162
- Ready?
- Ready.

553
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:32,911
- You okay?
- Okay.

554
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:34,540
We're done.

555
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:37,623
See, it's starting to swell.

556
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:39,001
It is starting to swell.

557
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:40,773
Either that or the rest
of my face is shrinking.

558
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:42,331
I think we should
put something on it.

559
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:43,922
Uh, concealer and loose powder?

560
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:45,492
Ice, mom.
I think we should put ice on it.

561
00:22:45,526 --> 00:22:47,881
So boring.
Neosporin and an eye patch?

562
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:51,072
Bactine, bacitracin, hydrogen peroxide.
Winnie The Pooh band-aids?

563
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:52,690
I'm getting you some ice.

564
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:56,011
Good lord.
Where'd I get all this stuff?

565
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:57,770
How can you not have ice?

566
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:59,221
You know I don't cook.

567
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:01,621
That is not cooking.
That is the opposite of cooking.

568
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:04,242
That's freezing. All you have in
here are like batteries and film

569
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,363
and something I think used
to be an ice cream sandwich.

570
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:10,723
- How old is that film?
- Ugh, 1999.

571
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:13,253
Bad hair year for me,
skirts were the wrong length,

572
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,632
cut me right at the calf.
I can't bring myself to develop it.

573
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:17,330
You're not putting
shaving cream on your eye.

574
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:21,052
No, just getting rid of
some of Luke's things.

575
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:22,832
- Steak.
- Huh?

576
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:24,722
Steak is supposed to be
good for a black eye.

577
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,960
Frozen peas.

578
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:27,481
Why would I put peas in my eye?

579
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:30,501
No, like a bag of frozen peas.
It molds to the contour of your face.

580
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:32,143
But steak has actual
healing properties.

581
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:34,731
Something about the juices or
the fats is good for the skin.

582
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,393
I'm going to Doose's
to get you some ice.

583
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:38,321
And steak. And peas.
And ice cream!

584
00:23:38,338 --> 00:23:39,632
That would feel good on my eye.

585
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:42,972
And then when I'm done using it,
we can eat it.

586
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:44,322
It's black-eye dinner.

587
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:45,943
Says the woman who
can't cook ice.

588
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,583
Oh please. I'm not gonna cook.
I'm too injured. You cook.

589
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:52,101
And get some bacitracin. Whatever
we use it for, we're almost out.

590
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:54,141
- Be right back.
- Thanks.

591
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:57,103
See if he has eye patches.

592
00:23:57,115 --> 00:23:59,270
Okay, everyone, gather 'round.

593
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:01,392
Witness the miracle
of modern...

594
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,850
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

595
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:05,730
What, does this look
like a soup kitchen?

596
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:07,171
Well, it's a little depressing,
but no --

597
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:10,103
- Pay your bill.
- Oh, right, sorry.

598
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:13,092
- I wasn't trying to skip out or anything.
- Get lost.

599
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:23,842
There's nobody left to serve,
and I certainly don't want your company.

600
00:24:23,848 --> 00:24:25,293
Thanks, Luke.

601
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:28,482
Hi, miss Patty.
Hey, Gypsy. Hi, Lulu.

602
00:24:28,496 --> 00:24:30,082
- Rory!
- Hi, Rory.

603
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:32,372
Look at the college girl.
You home for the summer, chicky?

604
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:33,103
I am

605
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:34,323
You look wonderful.

606
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,720
If I had known that college
was so good for the complexion,

607
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:38,873
I might have cracked a book
open when I was younger.

608
00:24:38,886 --> 00:24:39,940
Oh, thanks.

609
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:41,932
Your mom said you might
be traveling in Asia.

610
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:42,903
She's not in Asia.

611
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,340
I didn't know you
were going to Asia.

612
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,392
I was talking about it,
but that's not gonna happen.

613
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:48,263
Well, your mom must be
happy to have you home.

614
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,273
Yeah, she is.
What's going on here?

615
00:24:50,286 --> 00:24:52,523
Taylor's putting a camera
on the traffic light.

616
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,082
Big brother is watching.

617
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,880
Okay, everyone.
Thanks for coming.

618
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:59,471
Now, as you know,
small-town law enforcement

619
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:00,933
presents many challenges.

620
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:04,381
Chief among them, how to police our
streets without an actual police force.

621
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:06,943
Fortunately for the
citizens of Stars Hollow,

622
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:10,760
the fine people at Ingram Traffic
Systems have provided an answer.

623
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,562
I would now like to present

624
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:16,833
the latest and greatest weapon in
unmanned high-tech law enforcement.

625
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,443
Ladies and gentlemen,

626
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:22,601
the auto patrol P.R. 100.

627
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:27,110
How it works is very simple.

628
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:29,590
When someone drives
through the red light,

629
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:32,542
the camera will take
three successive pictures

630
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:35,722
of the offending party at
closer and closer range.

631
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,351
Seems kind of intrusive to me.

632
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:40,991
Law-abiding citizens have
nothing to worry about.

633
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:47,730
Now, we are going to have our ceremonial
first lawbreaker played by Kirk.

634
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:52,563
Kirk will drive my classic
1964 Ford Thunderbird

635
00:25:52,578 --> 00:25:55,270
down the street,
through the red light,

636
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:58,873
and the auto patrol P.R.
100 will capture him

637
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:02,053
in all his law-breaking glory.

638
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:04,512
- Miss Patty?
- I'm on it.

639
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:33,270
I'm okay! I'm okay!

640
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,153
Okay, do you remember when
you begged me to go see

641
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,631
"The fast and the furious" with you,
and I said no?

642
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,112
And then you begged
me to go see

643
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:48,150
"The fast and the furious 2" with you,
and I said no?

644
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:51,850
Then "The fast anthe furious 3:
Tokyo drift" came out...

645
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:53,140
They're cars, they drift.

646
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:56,280
And I was like,
"I said no to 1 and I said no to 2 --

647
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:58,871
"what do you think happened here,
I got a brain transplant or something?"

648
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:00,360
I remember. You were very rude.

649
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,311
Well, I was wrong,
because I have finally understood

650
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:05,490
the awesomeness of cars
crashing into things,

651
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:07,101
which is a long-winded
way of saying that

652
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:09,510
Taylor installed this red-light
camera in front of Luke's,

653
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:12,312
and Kirk was supposed to
demonstrate how it worked,

654
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:14,692
but he got totally
blinded by the camera,

655
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:18,043
and he ended up crashing
Taylor's fancy blue T-bird --

656
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:19,503
which, by the way, who knew? --

657
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:21,390
into the side of Luke's.

658
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:22,963
And nobody was hurt.
Everything was fine.

659
00:27:22,996 --> 00:27:24,902
But the smash-up
was unbelievable.

660
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,603
And it went right into Luke's

661
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:28,793
and then Kirk gets up,
he gets out of thet car,

662
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:32,562
and he's all like, Evel Knievel style,
like, "I'm okay, I'm okay."

663
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:33,771
And... um...

664
00:27:33,788 --> 00:27:35,942
why is everything you own in
piles all over the floor?

665
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:38,260
Wait a minute.
Into the diner and nobody was hurt?

666
00:27:38,275 --> 00:27:39,862
Yeah, everything's fine.
But what is this?

667
00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:42,040
There must've been a lot of damage.
Are you sure everybody's okay?

668
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,783
Oh, it was a mess, but everything's
fine, I swear. What is this?

669
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:48,673
I'm just getting some of
Luke's stuff together.

670
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:50,590
- This is Luke's?
- No, this is mine.

671
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:53,963
But I wore it with Luke when
we went to see "Jarhe."

672
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:55,733
I was trying to
look kind of army,

673
00:27:55,748 --> 00:27:58,263
and something about the combination
of the movie and the hot dogs

674
00:27:58,295 --> 00:28:00,553
at the Waterbury cineplex made
me sick in the parking lot,

675
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:03,990
and Luke held my hair, and it was nice,
and now I got to get rid of it.

676
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,413
Yeah, this pile
is Luke's stuff.

677
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:09,510
This pile is stuff that
reminds me of Luke.

678
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:10,602
What's that pile?

679
00:28:10,616 --> 00:28:13,293
- Those are Babette's intimates.
- Of course.

680
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:15,530
So, all these books
remind you of Luke?

681
00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:18,912
Yeah, those are books I gave
him to read, but he never did.

682
00:28:18,925 --> 00:28:20,833
Cormac McCarthy -- good call.

683
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:22,351
"In cold blood" --
he would have loved that.

684
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:23,623
Well, he'll never know now.

685
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,383
You wanted him to read "Hammerhead
sharks -- demons of the deep"?

686
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:27,812
He recommended that one for me.

687
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:29,762
Pom-pom socks.

688
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:32,130
Al's Pancake World
takeout menus.

689
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:34,150
Hey, you're getting
rid of Bop It?

690
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,122
And a spatula? Why?

691
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:39,962
Oh, oh.
'Cause Luke used to make you breakfast.

692
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:41,962
He did, but that's not
why I'm getting rid of it.

693
00:28:41,978 --> 00:28:45,230
Although now that you mention it,
the waffle iron has got to be dumped.

694
00:28:45,246 --> 00:28:46,001
We have a waffle iron?

695
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:47,582
Don't get attached.
It's got to go.

696
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,032
Spatula?

697
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:50,721
We were having an
argument in the kitchen.

698
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:53,430
And he said it was a fight, and I said
it wasn't really a fight, it was a spat.

699
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,620
He said there was no difference
between a fight and a spat,

700
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:57,831
and I said there was a huge
difference between a fight and a spat

701
00:28:57,868 --> 00:29:00,070
because a fight cannot be
diffused in the moment,

702
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:04,260
but a spat can easily be diffused
with the use of a spatula.

703
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:07,853
And I took the spatula out of the drawer,
and I whacked him with it a little bit,

704
00:29:07,865 --> 00:29:11,193
and he started laughing,
and I started laughing, and...

705
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:12,900
now I got to get rid of it.

706
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:14,992
- Sad.
- I know.

707
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,811
Okay, what happened
between you two?

708
00:29:16,826 --> 00:29:18,661
You have got to give
me something here,

709
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:21,383
because you cannot just say that
you don't want to talk about it,

710
00:29:21,397 --> 00:29:23,540
because I saw Lukes today,
and I waved at him,

711
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:24,790
and I did not know how to act.

712
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,553
I mean, was it an "I hate you" wave,
or an "I'm sorry" wave,

713
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,481
or "I can't believe you wanted
my mother to shave her head

714
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:30,793
and become a moonie" wave.

715
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:32,060
He doesn't want me
to shave my head.

716
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:33,183
You shouldn't hate him.

717
00:29:33,196 --> 00:29:35,242
There's nothing to
be angry about.

718
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:37,211
You knew we were having
problems, right?

719
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:39,371
The whole April thing and
postponing the wedding.

720
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:41,701
Finally, I got tired
of waiting for him,

721
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:43,550
so I gave him an ultimatum.

722
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:45,950
And he said no. So, that's it.

723
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:48,980
It's over.
Here I am, making piles.

724
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:52,021
The third stage of
grief is making piles.

725
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:56,303
Steak or peas?

726
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:57,721
No, no, no --
this is not my fault!

727
00:29:57,737 --> 00:29:59,363
This is all your fault,
Taylor, all of it!

728
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,092
Lucas, I understand
why you're perturbed.

729
00:30:01,107 --> 00:30:02,590
Perturbed? Do I seem perturbed?

730
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:05,630
I am so far past perturbed
that I couldn't look behind me

731
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:07,132
and see perturbed
with a telescope.

732
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:09,011
You never listen to
anybody, Taylor.

733
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:11,813
You just barrel along and decide
what's best for everybody,

734
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:12,980
consequences be damned.

735
00:30:12,998 --> 00:30:16,530
Now, I grant you the ceremony today
did not go entirely according to plan.

736
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,932
According to plan?
There's a car in my diner --

737
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:20,752
a freaking car, Taylor.

738
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:24,630
A two-door 1965 Ford
Thunderbird in my diner.

739
00:30:24,646 --> 00:30:25,781
Actually, it's a '64.

740
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:27,630
So, you do you think?
You want me to move it out or not?

741
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:30,263
I would really advise waiting
until our insurance agents arrived.

742
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:31,910
It's up to you, pal.
It's on your property.

743
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:33,680
- I don't know yet!
- You could have some sympathy.

744
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:36,792
After all, it's my car that crashed,
my most prized possession.

745
00:30:36,808 --> 00:30:38,972
I mean, the paint job alone
is gonna cost me a fortune,

746
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:40,642
and who knows what other
damage has been done

747
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:42,283
or what my insurance
will or won't cover?

748
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,960
Well, maybe I'll come
back with a sledgehammer,

749
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:45,511
and you can tell them
you totaled the thing.

750
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:48,430
Luke, I would strongly advise
against any rash action

751
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:51,162
that could lead to undue
and costly litigation.

752
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:53,031
- How about now?
- Giant red spots.

753
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:54,553
Nothing but giant red spots.

754
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:55,881
How's it look
under there, Gypsy?

755
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:57,511
Well, the car is fine.

756
00:30:57,527 --> 00:31:00,141
It definitely wasn't faulty
brakes that caused the accident.

757
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,111
Kirk is just an idiot.

758
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,131
Hey, I resent that.
Who was that?

759
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:04,422
Damn giant red spots.

760
00:31:04,435 --> 00:31:05,492
What do you want
to do here, buddy?

761
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:07,561
You want me to pull the car out or
you wanna wait for the insurance guy?

762
00:31:07,596 --> 00:31:09,233
I'm not sure what
I want to do yet.

763
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:11,472
I need to know now.
I can't spend all day here.

764
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:14,161
Either we move the car right now,
or I take off, you leave it in here,

765
00:31:14,198 --> 00:31:16,513
and wait for the insurance guys.
You got to decide.

766
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:19,383
Look, do not pressure me, okay?
I do not like being pressured.

767
00:31:19,396 --> 00:31:21,243
It's not one or the other.
I need to think.

768
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,253
Will you people just give
me some time to think?

769
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:28,782
- Soothing.
- Very.

770
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:31,241
- Zen.
- Thoreau, Walden Pond.

771
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:33,740
- Oh, I have an idea.
- Huh?

772
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:37,313
Maybe I should just go to Ikea.

773
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,960
- I like it.
- Yeah?

774
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:47,091
Maybe you can use it as the
basis for your redecorating.

775
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:49,801
Use it as a jumping-off point.
Make everything kind of gray and shiny.

776
00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:51,601
Well, it doesn't remind
me of Luke at all.

777
00:31:51,615 --> 00:31:54,341
Well, that's my problem.
It doesn't remind me of Logan either.

778
00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:55,591
It's so frustrating.

779
00:31:55,606 --> 00:31:56,990
Why don't you just call him?

780
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:59,921
I can't do that until I know what
this is, until I know what it means.

781
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,850
See, this long distance
thing isn't working already.

782
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,113
Rory, he just left.

783
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,961
Exactly, and I'm already
completely confused.

784
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:07,500
I mean,
I think we're still together,

785
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:09,890
but that's what I thought last
time we spent time apart.

786
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:12,303
I was 100% sure that we
were still together,

787
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:14,960
and he was 100% sure
that we had broken up,

788
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,001
and then he ended up sleeping
with those bridesmaids.

789
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,763
What is it you guys agreed to?

790
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:20,423
Well, that's just it.
Nothing, really.

791
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:21,803
I mean,
it was early in the morning,

792
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:24,031
and we hadn't had a chance
to decide on anything,

793
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,763
and we hadn't had the talk.

794
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:27,161
Now it's too late.

795
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:28,681
He's thousands of miles away,

796
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,562
and we talk on the phone,
but we don't really say anything.

797
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:33,161
And he's leaving me rockets.

798
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:36,102
Well, it's not too late.
He's been gone a day -- less than a day.

799
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:37,172
You guys will figure it out.

800
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,220
But it's hard on the phone, you know.
I can't see him.

801
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,720
I can't read his expression.

802
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:43,401
How am I ever supposed to know
what he's thinking or feeling?

803
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,182
I mean,
his eyes always give him away.

804
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,961
Logan has very expressive eyes.

805
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:48,070
I've noticed.

806
00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:49,991
It's one of the things he and
Bette Davis have in common.

807
00:32:50,027 --> 00:32:53,112
And sometimes he'll smile at me,
and I can tell exactly how he's feeling,

808
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,563
and now I can't.

809
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:55,910
So go to London.

810
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:57,491
- What?
- Go to London.

811
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,971
Go be with him this summer.

812
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:01,743
The two of you were supposed to go
traveling in Asia together anyway.

813
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,631
You don't have any plans for the summer,
so go.

814
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,712
I can't just go to London.

815
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:07,960
- Can I?
- Why not?

816
00:33:07,976 --> 00:33:10,272
You two could have an amazing
summer together in London.

817
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:11,883
Pick up the phone. Call him.

818
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:13,991
I need to do some
more googling.

819
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:15,693
I'm going to bed.

820
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,873
- So Taylor's car is...
- In Luke's diner.

821
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:16,991
- Hello.
- Hey, how you doing?

822
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:18,122
Fine.

823
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:20,083
I'm just checking in.

824
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:23,033
Had a really great
time last night.

825
00:34:25,247 --> 00:34:28,010
Don't worry.
This is not a booty call.

826
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:31,921
It can't be, 'cause you're not 18,
and it's not 1997.

827
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,473
Are you doing anything
tomorrow night?

828
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,342
'Cause I was thinking
maybe you could come over,

829
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:37,443
and I could cook us some diner.

830
00:34:37,457 --> 00:34:38,751
Christopher.

831
00:34:38,765 --> 00:34:40,403
Lorelai.

832
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:44,923
Let's not make more
out of it than it was.

833
00:34:44,936 --> 00:34:46,711
So, you're saying last
night was a booty call.

834
00:34:46,746 --> 00:34:49,320
I'm just saying,
I don't think it should happen again.

835
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:50,732
Oh.

836
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:52,893
Okay.

837
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:56,702
Well, I'm here for you
if you need anything.

838
00:34:56,716 --> 00:34:57,911
You know that, right?

839
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:00,601
I -- yeah, no --
I appreciate... that.

840
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:03,010
Okay. I guess I'll
say good night.

841
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:04,812
Yeah -- night.

842
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:06,501
Okay.

843
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:14,082
I got it, I got it.
He loved her so much

844
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:17,231
he was willing to wait 40
years alone in space for her.

845
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:20,840
I got it. The rocket, I get it.

846
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:22,013
You do?

847
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:24,511
Yes. I have been googling rockets,
you know.

848
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:27,600
Rocket ships, rocket love,
rocket London, Logan rocket,

849
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,140
and let me tell you, it has not always
been a pleasant journey. People are freaks.

850
00:35:31,155 --> 00:35:33,473
But then I found this blog,
rocket boy.

851
00:35:33,488 --> 00:35:34,880
- Rocket boy.
- Rocket boy.

852
00:35:34,897 --> 00:35:36,561
Knows a ton about rockets.
And as it turns out,

853
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:39,020
he's got over 200
classic L.E.V.s.

854
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:41,373
- L.E.V.s?
- Lunar Excursion Vehicles.

855
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:43,533
So then he tells me that
he hosts this chat-room,

856
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:45,882
and this is where
I get really lucky,

857
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:48,851
because rocketchamp465
was just logging off,

858
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:51,222
and I caught him,
and I described the rocket to him,

859
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:54,412
and he recognized it from one of
these episodes of "The Twilight Zone."

860
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:55,512
"The Twilight Zone."

861
00:35:55,525 --> 00:35:57,342
So I clicked on "The
Twilight Zone" website,

862
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,853
and I found the episode,
and I got it!

863
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,341
I still have no idea what
you're talking about.

864
00:36:02,357 --> 00:36:04,401
When Logan and I were
first going out,

865
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:06,392
we were in the pool house
one night really late,

866
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,661
and we were falling
asleep on the couch.

867
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:08,600
Wa wa wa.

868
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:09,821
- Mom.
- Sorry.

869
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,642
- Chachi, right?
- Proud.

870
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:14,220
- So, we were on the couch.
- Wa wa wa.

871
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,152
And this episode of "The Twilight
Zone" came on -- "The Long Morrow."

872
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:18,143
That's a bad title.

873
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:19,741
- That's not the point.
- I'm just saying.

874
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:23,521
So, there's this astronaut who was
supposed to go into space for 40 years,

875
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:26,011
but right before he left,
he met this beautiful woman.

876
00:36:26,028 --> 00:36:28,153
But for those 40 years that
he was going to be in space,

877
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,372
he was going to be in
suspended animation.

878
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:32,053
So when he came back to earth,

879
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,521
he was going to
be really young,

880
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:35,362
but she would be really old.

881
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:38,471
So he goes into space,
and when he does come back,

882
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,453
the woman is still
young and beautiful

883
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:44,081
because she put herself in
suspended animation to wait for him,

884
00:36:44,097 --> 00:36:45,621
but he's really, really old

885
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,173
because he took himself
out of suspended animation

886
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:49,773
so he could be old with her.

887
00:36:49,788 --> 00:36:50,832
How depressing.

888
00:36:50,848 --> 00:36:53,891
He spent 40 years alone in
space just waiting to see her,

889
00:36:53,906 --> 00:36:56,352
and he was willing to come
back as an 80-year-old man,

890
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,372
giving up almost
his entire life

891
00:36:58,386 --> 00:37:00,520
just to spend those last
few years with her.

892
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:02,792
Now, are you aware when you're
in suspended animation,

893
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,372
or is it just like
a really long nap?

894
00:37:04,387 --> 00:37:08,691
Shush! The point is, that this is Logan's
favorite episode of "The Twilight Zone."

895
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:10,630
And when we watched
it together,

896
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,391
he said, "that's true love."

897
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:15,092
That's true love!

898
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:17,783
This is the most romantic
gift I've ever been given.

899
00:37:17,797 --> 00:37:20,250
I mean, I have to call him.
I'm going to London.

900
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:21,522
I am going to London.

901
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,612
Yay!

902
00:37:22,626 --> 00:37:24,841
But -- wait,
are you gonna be okay while I'm gone?

903
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:27,171
Yes, I'll be fine.

904
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:30,102
Okay, but we're going shopping
for linens before I go.

905
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:34,100
- Hello?
- Hey!

906
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:34,992
Hey!

907
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:37,052
I'm sorry for calling so early.
Did I wake you?

908
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,803
I'm actually at the office.

909
00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:39,720
On a dare?

910
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:41,921
It's my first day, so I'm trying
to make a good impression.

911
00:37:41,956 --> 00:37:43,960
So you're, like,
dressed and everything?

912
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:46,120
New suit, new shoes,
even brushed my hair.

913
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:48,341
How's the office? Is it fabulous?
Do you have a window?

914
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:50,291
I wouldn't say it's fabulous,
but I do have a window.

915
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:51,562
Can you see the queen?

916
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:53,531
Actually, my window looks
out on Piccadilly Circus.

917
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:55,153
So, you can just see
elephants and clowns

918
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:56,880
walking past your
building all day long?

919
00:37:56,897 --> 00:37:58,492
- That must be nice.
- It's brilliant.

920
00:37:58,507 --> 00:38:00,661
Brilliant? Oh, my god.
You're turning british.

921
00:38:00,677 --> 00:38:02,141
Do you have a secretary
named Moneypenny?

922
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:03,911
My secretary's name is Steven.

923
00:38:03,926 --> 00:38:06,533
- Steven Moneypenny?
- Yes.

924
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:10,592
So... I just wanted to
thank you for the rocket.

925
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:11,882
You already thanked me.

926
00:38:11,897 --> 00:38:14,152
Oh, I know, I did,
but I wanted to do it again,

927
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:18,000
because I'm not sure I conveyed how much
I loved it in our last conversation.

928
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:20,541
I really, really loved it.

929
00:38:20,557 --> 00:38:21,850
I'm glad.

930
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:24,530
I can't wait to come see you, Logan.
I can't wait.

931
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:26,450
- I already got you a ticket.
- You're kidding.

932
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:29,310
I got it right here. I was gonna fedex
it to you. You'll have it by tomorrow.

933
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:30,423
Oh, my god!

934
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:33,250
Yeah, so tell your mom you're
not gonna be home for Christmas.

935
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:34,482
Christmas?

936
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:35,780
Two weeks, just you and me.

937
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:37,320
I already cleared it with my dad.
It's gonna be amazing.

938
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,291
I'm still playing around with the
itinerary, but how do you feel about

939
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:40,981
- London, Paris, and Rome?
- Wow.

940
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:43,423
I figured we'd do a week in London,
then quick train ride,

941
00:38:43,435 --> 00:38:45,333
and we do three days in Paris,
and we finish our trip

942
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:46,920
with a four-day
sojourn in Rome.

943
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:48,512
We still have enough time
for one last night in London

944
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:49,571
before you have
to fly back home.

945
00:38:49,608 --> 00:38:52,152
Logan, that sounds amazing.

946
00:38:52,168 --> 00:38:53,822
Oh, hey, I should take off.

947
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:55,410
My first staff meeting.
They're waving me in.

948
00:38:55,447 --> 00:38:56,863
Oh, okay, good luck.

949
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:59,182
- Thanks, cheers.
- Cheers.

950
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:27,762
Uh... a car crashed into
my diner yesterday.

951
00:39:27,777 --> 00:39:30,161
There's a giant hole
where my wall used to be.

952
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:33,483
It's gonna take a
couple of weeks to fix.

953
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,541
It's a disaster,
but I don't care.

954
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:39,713
I mean, I care, but...

955
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:43,481
You know what, no. I really --

956
00:39:43,498 --> 00:39:45,150
I don't care.

957
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,330
It's like it's not
even real to me.

958
00:39:48,348 --> 00:39:52,152
It's like my life
isn't even real to me

959
00:39:52,168 --> 00:39:54,813
unless you're there,
and you're in it,

960
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:56,881
and I'm sharing it with you.

961
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:59,450
And, uh,
I don't know what I was waiting for,

962
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:01,452
and I don't know what I was scared of,
but I'm not.

963
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:04,350
I'm not scared, and I'm not waiting.
I'm here.

964
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,582
- Luke.
- No, don't say anything.

965
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:10,461
I've got a tank full of gas,
and Maryland is only 200 miles away,

966
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:13,460
and I've made us some reservations
at a couple of bed-and-breakfasts.

967
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:16,421
If you don't want to do the
Maryland thing, we don't have to.

968
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:18,280
I heard you say
"Maryland" the other day.

969
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:21,243
I don't know whether you were serious.
I'm just trying to cover my bases here.

970
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:23,171
- Luke --
- I also packed some camping equipment

971
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:26,652
so we can head to Vermont or Maine and,
you know,

972
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:30,583
check into a cabin for a week,
you know, like a little honeymoon thing.

973
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:34,561
But maybe that's a little
too rustic for your taste.

974
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:37,672
Or we could drive
to Atlantic City

975
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,900
or even Las Vegas if you want to
make a real road trip out of it.

976
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:42,212
Luke, stop.

977
00:40:42,226 --> 00:40:45,550
I also did some research,
and we can also apparently

978
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:47,693
use a sea captain, if you want.

979
00:40:47,705 --> 00:40:50,273
I'm not sure how big the boat
has to be for it to be legal,

980
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:53,263
but we can head to the coast,
and we can knock on some doors,

981
00:40:53,277 --> 00:40:55,433
you know, boat doors.

982
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:58,203
Yeah, that's probably not
the most sensible way.

983
00:40:58,217 --> 00:41:00,472
- Just stop.
- But, no, you were right.

984
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:03,691
Okay. I need to be faster. I need to
move faster, I need to think faster.

985
00:41:03,707 --> 00:41:06,481
And, well, here I am.

986
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:09,671
It's over.

987
00:41:09,686 --> 00:41:11,542
No, you can't say that.

988
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:14,062
You can't just say that it's over.
It's not over.

989
00:41:14,076 --> 00:41:17,273
You can't just decide that it's over.
I'm in this, too, you know.

990
00:41:17,285 --> 00:41:20,781
I'm not gonna let it be over.
You said, "be ready now or never."

991
00:41:20,797 --> 00:41:21,801
I'm ready now.

992
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,072
- Luke.
- Let's go.

993
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:25,590
Let's do this.
Let's get married right now.

994
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:27,141
Let's go.

995
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,130
I slept with Christopher.

996
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:54,532
