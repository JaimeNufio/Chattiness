1
00:00:00,738 --> 00:00:02,758
Previously on "Gilmore Girls"...

2
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:06,767
"Once Luke Danes
is in your life,

3
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:08,791
he is in your life forever."

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:16,066
Obviously you still have very
deep feelings for the guy.

5
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:17,672
As you know, this course...

6
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,516
will take a specific look at...

7
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:22,943
processes and determinants...

8
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:25,310
- Tell me you're not in love with him.
- I'm not in love with him.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,026
And if you don't take this very
seriously, then this whole thing

10
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:30,550
could fall apart faster than
you could possibly imagine.

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,029
And he'll be gone,
and you'll be alone again.

12
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,215
I can't be your rebound.

13
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:36,651
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:39,533
Christopher?

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,152
- Ooh! What is that?
- It's just my phone.

16
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:51,492
Holy smoke! I don't know
what I thought that was --

17
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:53,621
some alarm on your
pants or something.

18
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:56,430
No, that's not my pants alarm. The
pants alarm sounds more like a siren.

19
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:58,363
You want to answer that?
Should we put this down?

20
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:02,121
That's okay. I'm afraid if we put
it down, we won't pick it up again.

21
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:03,822
Oh, this is gonna be good,

22
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:06,150
what with this one here
and the two palms,

23
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,842
oh, boy, Morey's eyes are
gonna pop out of his head!

24
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:11,413
Why? Does he find plants
particularly startling?

25
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:12,951
- I'm making a jungle.
- A jungle?

26
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:14,442
- For the bedroom.
- Ugh! Enough said.

27
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,411
- Hey, is that your inside phone?
- Yeah, I'll call them back.

28
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:20,530
So, anyway, I got this negligee
with sort of a snake pattern.

29
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:21,731
Oh, boy! Is this heavy!

30
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,262
It is. It is. I'm sorry, doll.

31
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:25,580
I wasn't hoping that you
would lug this with me.

32
00:01:25,598 --> 00:01:27,171
I was planning on
asking Christopher.

33
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,280
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:30,163
I haven't seen him much lately.

35
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:32,223
Well, his work keeps him busy.

36
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:35,173
What's he do -- something with
computers? Very mysterious.

37
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:36,913
Yeah, he's a man of mystery.

38
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:38,910
You know who's a man
of mystery? Morey.

39
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:41,183
After decades in the bedroom,
who would have thought

40
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:44,593
that the idea of dressing up like a
howler monkey would be such a turn-on?

41
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:47,081
Right. I'm gonna get this,
Babette. Hello?

42
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:48,923
Rory?

43
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:51,012
Honey, what's wrong?

44
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:54,060
Oh, no.

45
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,702
On my way.

46
00:01:57,048 --> 00:01:58,590
Sorry, Babette!

47
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:02,143
Morey!

48
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:17,811
Excuse me, miss.
Is that your phone?

49
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,852
Oh. Um, sorry.

50
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:21,863
H-Hello?

51
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:23,270
- Hey.
- Hey.

52
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:24,602
- I'm here.
- Good.

53
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:26,842
- Where are you?
- I'm here. I'm in the waiting room.

54
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:29,572
Uh, okay.
I must be in the wrong waiting room.

55
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:32,473
I'm not in the E.R. anymore.
I'm in the cardiac intensive-care unit,

56
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:33,650
the C.I.C.U.

57
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,682
That's where I am, I think.
First floor?

58
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:36,610
First floor.

59
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,292
There's a red stripe
on the floor.

60
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:40,072
It's kind of orange here.

61
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,483
- Orange?
- Reddish-orange, so maybe.

62
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:45,413
Well, yeah, orangey red.
Maybe the lights make it look more red.

63
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:47,181
- Oh. Hi.
- Hey.

64
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,572
Um, they're doing tests,
so that's where he is --

65
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,300
blood tests and another E.K.G.

66
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:55,380
They did an E.K.G. in the ambulance, but
I guess they're still trying to determine

67
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,932
how much damage was actually
caused by the heart attack.

68
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:01,072
But that's definitely what it was.
It was a myocardial infarction,

69
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:02,360
which is a heart attack.

70
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:06,202
I guess the E.K.G. tells them how
bad the blockage of his arteries is

71
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:09,470
and  what degree of
coronary-artery disease he has,

72
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:10,840
or C.A.D.,
as they're calling it,

73
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,772
because, apparently, everything is --
what do you call it?

74
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:17,271
An anagram? What's the thing
with the letters? Acronym.

75
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:20,073
The C.A.D.,
C.I.C.U., the E.K.G.

76
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,720
Mom, it was awful.
He just fell down.

77
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,440
It's gonna be okay.

78
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:33,583
Hi, Chris, it's me again.

79
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:35,620
Uh... I'm at the hospital now,

80
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:39,632
and, um, it was a heart attack,
but dad's okay.

81
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:41,250
He's just getting some tests.

82
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:45,742
So, um... we're in the C.I.C.U.
at John Skinner medical center.

83
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:49,463
It's on the first floor, and there's
a red stripe running down the hallway.

84
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:51,910
Just please call me when you get this,
okay? Thanks.

85
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,960
Well, my brain wasn't up to
choosing between things,

86
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:02,441
so I got one of everything.

87
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:03,653
You do me proud.

88
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:05,430
So, grandma's on her way.
I didn't talk to her,

89
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:07,551
but the girl at the club
said she's en route.

90
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,390
Oh, okay. And what about dad?

91
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,511
Oh, he's probably... en route.

92
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,531
Hmm. Is everything okay?

93
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,270
Yeah, I don't think he's
gotten my messages yet,

94
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:16,931
but he'll be here when he does.

95
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:17,983
Okay.

96
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:19,880
Well... what is your pleasure?

97
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:21,761
Well, let's see.

98
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,723
Uh... nothing sweet,
I don't think.

99
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:26,373
No? A salty thing?

100
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:28,392
A fluorescent-orange
ersatz-cheese thing?

101
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:29,531
I guess I'm not hungry.

102
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:30,991
Yeah, me neither.

103
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:34,520
I keep thinking this is
all just a nightmare.

104
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,040
- I know.
- But it's not.

105
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:38,201
No.  I mean, it's a nightmare
but not a nightmare nightmare.

106
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:40,691
I know 'cause I have shoes on. In my
nightmares, I never am wearing shoes.

107
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:42,131
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, yeah.

108
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:44,433
It's the worst thing in the dream, too.
I could be chased by snakes

109
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:47,593
or in a nuclear explosion,
but then I look down,

110
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:49,510
and, "oh, my god!
I'm not wearing shoes!"

111
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:50,850
I wonder what that means.

112
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:53,722
Probably means I have a fear
of hurting my bare feet

113
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:55,311
or of losing my shoes.

114
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,542
Not so freudian, huh?

115
00:05:56,558 --> 00:06:00,391
For me, a snake is just a snake,
a slingback is just a slingback.

116
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,643
Gilmore?

117
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:05,242
Hi. I'm Dr. Goldstein.

118
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:07,542
- You're Richard Gilmore's family?
- Yes. Is he okay?

119
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:10,060
He's doing all right.
He's conscious, cogent,

120
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:11,922
and not in
significant pain now.

121
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:13,112
- Oh, good.
- Good.

122
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:15,840
We just sent him to the cath
lab to get an angiogram.

123
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:18,460
After that,
we should be able to get a better sense

124
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:20,891
of what kind of blockage
is around his heart

125
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:23,043
and then we'll be able to figure
out where to go from there.

126
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:25,232
- Where would we go?
- Uh, pardon?

127
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:27,891
I mean, where --
where would we go?

128
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:30,041
Well, if the blockage
is more serious,

129
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,442
we will have to consider an 
emergency bypass surgery.

130
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:34,501
Okay.

131
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:37,221
I promise to let you know as soon as
we get the results from the cath lab.

132
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:39,413
- Try not to worry.
- No, not worried.

133
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:42,180
Just normal amount of worried for
someone whose father's had a heart attack,

134
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:43,373
but not excessively worried.

135
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:44,581
- Okay.
- Okay.

136
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:45,673
Thank you, doctor.

137
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:46,962
I'll see you in a little bit.

138
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:57,222
- Have you seen him?
- Oh, hi, mom.

139
00:06:57,238 --> 00:06:58,700
No,  not since he
was in the E.R.

140
00:06:58,717 --> 00:06:59,740
Where is he?

141
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:02,672
The doctor came out and said he's in
the cath lab, getting an angiogram.

142
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:03,961
He's gonna let us
know when he's done.

143
00:07:03,998 --> 00:07:05,580
- Nonsense.
- No, it's true.

144
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,899
He said he would come back
when he had the results.

145
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,355
I'm Emily Gilmore.
I would like to see my husband.

146
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,021
Let's see.
What is your husband's name?

147
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,810
Gilmore! Richard Gilmore!

148
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:15,591
I'm his wife,
and I would like to see him now.

149
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:18,033
I'm sorry, he's in the cath lab
right now, getting an angiogram.

150
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:20,052
The doctor will come find
you as soon as they're done.

151
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,272
There's no need to
be cheery about it.

152
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:25,243
Honestly, someone with your chipper
personality ought to be a weather girl

153
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:26,800
or a preschool teacher.

154
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:28,123
I'm sorry you feel that way.

155
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:30,011
Oh, please. Don't mope.

156
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:31,912
What happened to all
the competent people?

157
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:33,182
That's what I'd like to know.

158
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:35,310
Was there some giant
hole they all fell into

159
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:37,140
or a virus that
struck them all down,

160
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,603
leaving the morons of the
world to sit behind the desks?

161
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:41,710
Mom, wouldn't you like to sit down,
have a nice cup of tea?

162
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:43,100
I don't want a cup of tea.
What I want

163
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:45,371
is the most perfunctory level
of competence from the people

164
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:48,092
with whom I interact. That apparently
is far too much to ask for.

165
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:50,033
- Grandma, we have snacks.
- Yes, mom, snacks.

166
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,981
We have salty snacks
and sweet snacks

167
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:54,742
and sweet/salty hybrid snacks.

168
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:57,373
Even at the club, I'm telling you,
the young men and women that work there

169
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:59,703
must have a combined I.Q.
of a grapefruit.

170
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:01,112
You ask them for a towel,

171
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:03,521
and they look at you with
the most vacant eyes.

172
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:06,282
I'm telling you, I thought the
girl at reception was blind

173
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:08,043
the entire first month
she worked there --

174
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:11,150
blind, but very enthusiastic
about the application of eyeliner.

175
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,212
Sounds pretty.

176
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:13,792
My husband has a heart attack,

177
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:16,023
and how long does it
take them to find me?

178
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:17,850
40 minutes.

179
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:21,380
The nitwit probably got lost between
the front desk and the tennis courts.

180
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:23,160
I'm sorry, Grandma,
that sounds terrible.

181
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,982
I mean, none of this would have
been a problem if I'd been allowed

182
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:26,472
to keep my cellphone. But no.

183
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,581
Cellphones have been banned allegedly

184
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:29,943
because of noise pollution.

185
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:32,130
If that's the reason,
they should ban John Abbott.

186
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:33,992
Because I'm telling you,
every time that man hits a ball,

187
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:36,051
he grunts like a rutting hog.

188
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,822
He's twice as loud
as my cellphone.

189
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:40,961
They won't even let you leave your
cellphone on vibrate. It's preposterous.

190
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:43,621
I mean, what do they think we're doing,
making drug deals?

191
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:44,741
I doubt that's it.

192
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,140
Which, by the way,
are absolutely, 100% taking place.

193
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:50,653
I saw Devorah Inwood
handing Cardum Kelly

194
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,652
a small,
blue pill in the ladies' locker room

195
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,472
while they made shady
eyes at each other.

196
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:56,362
Drug deals at the club?
Mom, I don't think so.

197
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:58,551
Absolutely. The whole
place is going to the dogs.

198
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:01,912
Oh, and now apparently, they want
to start charging us for meals,

199
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:05,032
on top of the king's ransom we
pay in dues. It's appalling.

200
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:08,641
The very idea of charging extra
for the junk they serve there.

201
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:11,762
Oh, and you know
what really irks me?

202
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:14,151
They very rarely serve fish.

203
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:16,793
That's terrible,
especially for people who love fish.

204
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,473
In a way,
it's their fault that Richard's here.

205
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:19,692
Mom, what do you mean?

206
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:21,791
2 1/2 months ago,
I read an article that said

207
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:24,441
fish has been shown to prevent
heart attacks and stroke

208
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:26,783
and has innumerable
other health benefits.

209
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:27,713
Hey.

210
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:29,702
It's the omega-3 fatty acids --

211
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:32,842
that and the fact that it's an
incredibly lean source of protein.

212
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,881
So I immedialety had the
maid cut out the article

213
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:36,200
so I could show it to Richard.

214
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:39,392
And he agreed to eat more fish,
but he said not for dinner.

215
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:41,471
My spineless
kitchen staff caved.

216
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:44,072
Emily, Lorelai, I'm so sorry.
How are you holding up?

217
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,242
We're holding.

218
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:46,840
Logan, it's so good
of you to come.

219
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:49,441
Is there anything I can do for you?
Could I get you a cup of tea, maybe?

220
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:51,020
I just asked.
She doesn't want tea.

221
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,971
I would love a cup of tea.
That's very kind of you.

222
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:55,582
I'm on a tea hunt, then.

223
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,740
That's a fine young man,
Rory --

224
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:00,541
very sweet, very considerate.

225
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,530
I like him.

226
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:03,161
He's one of the good ones.

227
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:06,843
Lorelai, where's Christopher?

228
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:08,130
Oh, he's on his way.

229
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,322
From where?

230
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:12,200
Um, uh... Dr. Goldstein.

231
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:13,871
I'm Emily Gilmore.

232
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:15,342
Good. I'm glad you're here.

233
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,490
The blockage is worse
than we'd hoped.

234
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,342
I think the best
course of action --

235
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:21,101
really the only
course of action --

236
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:22,990
is to do an emergency
bypass surgery.

237
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:24,282
Open-heart surgery?

238
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:25,372
Let him finish, Lorelai.

239
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:26,973
We'd like to go into
surgery as soon as possible.

240
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:29,730
So, now would be the time if
you'd like to visit with him.

241
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,190
Yes. Yeah,
we'd like to see him.

242
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,581
If you'll follow me please.

243
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:37,600
Feel free to ask me any
questions you might have.

244
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:39,700
Are you the one who will
be performing the surgery?

245
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:42,081
Yes, along with a team.
I'll be the chief surgeon.

246
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:43,762
Where did you go to school?

247
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:44,850
I'm sorry?

248
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:46,792
- You did attend school, didn't you?
- Mom.

249
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:49,281
No, it's okay.
Yes, I got my B.A. at Yale.

250
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:51,142
I went to medical
school at Harvard.

251
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:53,323
I did my residency at
Columbia Presbyterian

252
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:56,370
before I became chief of
cardiothoracic surgery here.

253
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,701
- See?
- See what?

254
00:10:57,715 --> 00:10:59,613
Here we are.
I'll let you visit.

255
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,893
A nurse will be by shortly to
begin prepping Richard for surgery.

256
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,292
Thank you, doctor.

257
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:16,853
And I watched his hands closely.
They're steady as a statue's.

258
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:19,222
Oh, and, Richard,
he's Yale undergrad,

259
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:20,400
Harvard  medical school.

260
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,572
You don't say.

261
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:25,101
Well, if he does a good job,
I'll forget the Harvard part.

262
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,593
I'll write that off as
a youthful indiscretion.

263
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:29,892
This room is rather intimate.

264
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:32,120
It's just fine, Emily.
I promise you.

265
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:35,570
Now, Rory, I'm sorry I gave
you a scare in class today.

266
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,543
No, don't be silly.
I'm just glad you're okay

267
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:39,753
and that you're gonna be
more okay after the surgery.

268
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,622
Thank you.

269
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:43,070
Are you okay, dad? I mean, how are
you feeling, considering everything?

270
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:44,381
You okay? You look okay.

271
00:11:44,397 --> 00:11:47,322
Well, all in all,
I think I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

272
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:49,923
- Ronald Reagan.
- Quoting W.C. Fields.

273
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:52,240
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- It would be great time now.

274
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:54,650
Winter in Philadelphia is a great
time to see the Liberty Bell

275
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:57,671
and the cream cheese.
That's all I got on Philadelphia.

276
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:58,492
Lorelai.

277
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:00,830
Well, the cheesesteaks --
the Philly cheesesteaks.

278
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:03,240
Lorelai, please. Richard,
is your neck getting enough support?

279
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:04,620
It looks like you
need another pillow.

280
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,392
I don't know.
I think it's all right.

281
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:07,621
I got it, mom.

282
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,122
I can take care of it.

283
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:11,153
- I'm just handing you a pillow.
- I don't want that pillow.

284
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,163
- What's wrong with that pillow?
- It doesn't have a pillowcase.

285
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:14,680
Yes, it does. What's this?
It's a pillowcase.

286
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:16,912
Yes, it has one pillowcase. 
It should have two pillowcases

287
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,842
one facing each ways,
so the pillow is never exposed.

288
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:20,050
Now I have to ring for a pillow.

289
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:21,552
Mother, we have a pillow right here, why--

290
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:22,880
Tucson.

291
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,373
- What?
- Tucson is extremely hot,

292
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:28,203
and it has a dry climate that doesn't agree with me,

293
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,781
and I really don't think much of the way they dress out there.

294
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:34,820
And I have a deep aversion to cacti of all kinds.

295
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:39,041
And  yet Tucson is a place where I think I would rather be.

296
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,790
Anywhere but here, right, dad?

297
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,103
Although, it's awfully dry.

298
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:43,173
And so hot.

299
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:46,090
And you're right about the fashion -- ponchos and all that turquoise.

300
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:49,140
Oh, and men in sandals. Spare me.

301
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,163
So, how's it going there, Zach?

302
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:56,180
Aces. Pastrami on rye --
mustard, no mayo.

303
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:58,790
Cheeseburger --
swiss, double pickles, fries.

304
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:00,383
If you need anything else,
just holler.

305
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:03,503
My name's Zach, and, uh...
I'll be your waiter.

306
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:05,670
- So you holding up okay?
- Oh yeah.

307
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:08,611
I tell you, I was not looking forward
to this filling in for Lane deal.

308
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:10,480
So I was all, "oh no",
and then she's like,

309
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,002
"it's either this, or you fill in
during the whole childbirth deal."

310
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,631
Which would probably be
a bit more difficult.

311
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,380
Yeah, right.
Handing out food is cake

312
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,780
compared to having a human being
come out of you -- no offense.

313
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:20,652
None taken.
You're doing a good job.

314
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,633
Oh, man, I got to tell you,
it's been great.

315
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:24,240
I mean, it's been enlightening.

316
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:27,711
Like, in the past,
I was the one sitting at the table,

317
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:30,070
and now I'm the one with
the notepad and the pencil.

318
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:31,642
- You're on the inside.
- It's cool.

319
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:33,010
Don't let the power
go to your head.

320
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,583
No kidding. You know what
was freaking me out before?

321
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:38,081
I'm about to hand people the
food they're going to eat,

322
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:41,503
and I could do anything to it,
and they would have no idea.

323
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,612
I mean, they would just eat it.

324
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:47,413
Not that I would, of course,
but it's just intense.

325
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:48,973
Plus, everything
smells so good.

326
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:50,580
I can see why Lane
digs this job.

327
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,900
Well, your enthusiasm
is appreciated.

328
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:55,400
Right on.
Hey, you have another rag?

329
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:56,810
Cool.

330
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,181
Hey, Luke?

331
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:00,033
Hey, Babette.
What can I get you?

332
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,981
You still stocking the
jungle with snacks,

333
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,130
whatever that means? 

334
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:04,702
Luke, I got to tell
you something.

335
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:07,570
Or, I don't know if I got to,
but I want to.

336
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:10,090
It's not that I want to
like it's a good thing.

337
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:12,540
Lorelai's dad had
a heart attack.

338
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:14,501
- Oh, my god.
- Rory called Lorelai

339
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:16,350
- and I was there.
- Is he okay?

340
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:20,202
Well, he's not -- he's okay...
I think... right now.

341
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:22,891
They're  at John Skinner,
and I don't know... that's all I know.

342
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:23,802
Oh, my god.

343
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:26,023
Yeah, I-I thought you
would want to know.

344
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:27,500
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

345
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:29,623
All right. Well, I'm gonna go.

346
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:31,320
Yeah. Thanks.

347
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:32,681
You know what it's like?

348
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,760
Working here is like having
a backstage pass at a show.

349
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,420
It's all-access, man.

350
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:38,892
Right. Right.

351
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,702
Hey, it's me again.

352
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:48,772
I don't know if you
got my other message.

353
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:51,443
We're still here at the hospital,
and, uh...

354
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,901
dad's gonna have surgery.

355
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,372
He's having a coronary
bypass pretty soon.

356
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:57,211
I just came from his room,

357
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,550
and, um...
he doesn't look bad, you know?

358
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,483
He looks okay, considering.

359
00:15:01,597 --> 00:15:04,381
But, uh... he's lying down.

360
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:06,922
He just -- just looks so small.

361
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:09,362
It just made me
think of this time.

362
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:11,700
There was a tree in our
yard I would always climb,

363
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:13,272
and one day, I climbed up really,
really high.

364
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:16,081
Dad came home from work. I watched
him go into the house, and I thought,

365
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,820
"he looks so small."

366
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:20,581
It was so strange to
see him look like that.

367
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:25,570
Anyway, I should go, but, uh...
call me when you get this, okay?

368
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:27,550
Bye. Hello?

369
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,813
How are you? How is everything?
What can I do?

370
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:31,483
Oh no, it's okay. I'm okay.

371
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:33,932
Dad had a heart attack,
and he's gonna have surgery.

372
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:36,120
But I guess it's a pretty
common operation, so...

373
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,130
And how are you?

374
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:38,920
I'm okay, considering.

375
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:41,550
- What can I do?
- Oh, nothing, hon. I'm fine.

376
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:44,031
Can I send you anything?
I made lemon bars

377
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:46,712
and, ooh, pecan squares,
and I packed them up

378
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:48,640
and I'm sending them over
with Katie right now.

379
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,283
Oh, that was so sweet.

380
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,382
Is that Lorelai?

381
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:53,452
Yes. Her dad's in surgery,
but he's fine.

382
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,841
- How is Rory doing?
- Rory's doing fine, thanks.

383
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,270
- Tell Lorelai I say hello.
- Michel says hello.

384
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:00,350
- Tell Michel I said hello.
- She says hello.

385
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:03,050
Tell Lorelai that I am thinking of
her father and wishing him well.

386
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:05,093
He says he's thinking of your
father and wishing him well.

387
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:07,110
- Tell Michel "thank you."
- She says "thank you."

388
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:10,081
Tell Lorelai that the Zimmermans in
room 4 are not a married couple,

389
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:12,372
as we had thought,
but rather a brother and a sister.

390
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,582
No, I'm not telling Lorelai that.
She's in a hospital.

391
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:17,953
Tell her they requested a rollaway bed,
and we do not have any rollaway bed left.

392
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,041
I am not talking to Lorelai
about rollaway beds.

393
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:22,141
Tell Lorelai that the Zimmermans
are very demanding, and very big,

394
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:22,993
and they need a bed!

395
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:24,600
Tell Michel that the Murrays
are checking out at 3:00

396
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:26,592
and he can use the rolloway
bed from their room.

397
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,532
She says you can take the
rollaway bed from the Murrays.

398
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:29,882
They're checking out at 3:00.

399
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:32,312
Ahh! Very good.
Tell her "thank you."

400
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:34,943
He says "thank you" and
apologizes for being such a pest.

401
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:37,900
Tell her I miss her here very,
very much!

402
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,373
Well, then don't stick us in
the back corner next time.

403
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:43,201
Oh, you did,
you absolutely did, Anthony.

404
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:45,402
I was so close to the kitchen,
I could have reach

405
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:46,911
and gotten my own plate
without standing up,

406
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:49,622
just stretched out my arm
like Rubberman, and...

407
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,591
No, no, I'm just kidding.

408
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:53,630
So, tell me,
what's your special tonight?

409
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:57,870
Sea scallops? Oh, you're torturing me,
Anthony, torturing me.

410
00:16:57,887 --> 00:16:59,551
Well, give my love
to your wife.

411
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:00,993
Oh, I will.

412
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:04,172
Oh, just one of those
last-minute business trips.

413
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:06,191
All right, then. Bye-bye.

414
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:08,081
Somebody's very
chipper on the phone.

415
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:10,322
Somebody should consider a
career as a weather girl.

416
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:13,410
Oh, please, I've spent years cultivating
my relationship with the maitre d'

417
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:16,862
at Persephone's. I'm hardly about to
let it go down the drain in one night.

418
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:18,743
"Call Persephone's" -- done.

419
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,181
We're missing the sea scallops.

420
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:23,290
Persephone's does the most
wonderful job with seafood.

421
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:25,803
I wish we'd eaten there more often.
It's such a shame.

422
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:28,540
They make a cedar-plank
salmon that is --

423
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:29,850
I don't know if
you like salmon.

424
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:32,380
No, but I love a nice,
juicy cedar plank.

425
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:35,351
Salmon is one of the best fish
in terms of the omega-3s.

426
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:39,572
It's absolutely marvelous for you,
and it makes your skin positively glow.

427
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:42,682
Beauty tips are not really big on my
list of priorities right now, mom.

428
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,281
So I tell Paris,

429
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:46,692
"I don't care if it would
theoretically increase my chances

430
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,701
of getting a grant
to study in Russia.

431
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:52,061
I am not willing to pretend to be
an accomplished rhythmic gymnast."

432
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:54,251
How do you pretend to be a
rhythmic gymnast, anyway?

433
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:55,722
I don't even know.

434
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:58,482
Do you whirl around some ribbons?
Balance a ball on your nose?

435
00:17:58,498 --> 00:18:02,553
She's taking the idea of our impending
graduation with a pinch of total insanity.

436
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:04,622
- Logan you should answer that.
- Nah.

437
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:07,121
But it's practically buzzing off
the table. Really, I don't mind.

438
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:09,340
- I'll text them back in a minute.
- But you need to --

439
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:13,123
Rory, right now, I don't need to do
anything but be right here with you.

440
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:15,603
Well, are you sure?

441
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:17,663
Aren't people gonna be mad
you're not answering your phone?

442
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,563
Then that's their problem.

443
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:23,800
You know who's gonna
be mad at me? Paris.

444
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:26,172
Because right now,
I'm missing a G.R.E. prep course

445
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,670
and tea with the
Branford librarian.

446
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:29,502
I imagine she'll understand.

447
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:30,493
Paris?

448
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:32,510
Maybe you better start
balancing a ball on your nose.

449
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,481
I need to cancel
Richard's tennis match.

450
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:36,331
I guess I'm not gonna make
it to my book club tomorrow.

451
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,571
Just as well --
I haven't even cracked the cover.

452
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:41,032
Whatever gives Suzanna Shaw
the idea that the rest of us

453
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:44,720
share her barbaric interest in
Cormac McCarthy is beyond me.

454
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:47,751
Now let's see.
I need to return the Dean's call, and --

455
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:50,261
Oh, no. Not him again.
What's he doing here?

456
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:51,040
I don't know.

457
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:52,632
Hey. I was just in the diner.

458
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:55,021
Babette came and told me
your dad had a heart attack.

459
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:57,063
I swear, I didn't even know
what I was doing.

460
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:59,490
I just walked right out the
diner and drove straight here.

461
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:01,421
Now that I'm here,
I realize I might be in the way,

462
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:05,333
but if there's anything I can do,
I want to do it.

463
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:07,051
- Uh... well --
- Hi, Luke.

464
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:09,253
- Hey, Rory, Logan.
- Want some coffee?

465
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,213
No, I'm okay. Thanks very much.

466
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:14,151
Look, I don't want to cause
any kind of weirdness here.

467
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,291
I mean,
I don't want to make him feel --

468
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:18,683
Christopher actually isn't here yet,
but he will be any second, so...

469
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:20,642
Okay, I'll just
get out of here.

470
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:23,043
Thanks. There's just
not much for you to do.

471
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:25,420
Oh, yes, there is, absolutely.
There is plenty for you to do, Luke.

472
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,761
You can drive to the Yale campus
and pick up Richard's car.

473
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:29,943
- Mom, he can't do that.
- No, it's no problem.

474
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,842
I'm not exactly sure where it's parked,
but it shouldn't be hard to find.

475
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,122
Just check the faculty parking lot
and wherever else they have parking.

476
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:38,471
It's a 2006 Jaguar. It's green.

477
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:41,802
Oh, and I think it's a little low
on gas, so if you wouldn't mind

478
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:44,090
filling the tank, on the way back
to the house, that would be great.

479
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,040
Okay. Sure.

480
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,531
- Okay, I'll get the key.
- Mom...

481
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,910
Is he supposed to just drive the
car to the house, and then what,

482
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:50,920
then take a cab all the way
back to Yale to get his truck?

483
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,472
- I have no objection to that.
- Seriously, it's no problem.

484
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,301
See? Now fill it with premium,
not whatever sludge they try

485
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:58,583
- to pass off as regular.
- Premium, you got it.

486
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,561
You do know how to drive
a european car, don't you?

487
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:02,520
- Mom.
- Absolutely. Don't worry.

488
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,050
There's nothing to yank.
It's a Jaguar, not a lawn mower.

489
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,090
Oh, my god!

490
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,591
Just leave the
key with Soledad.

491
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:09,612
And... here.
You can keep the change.

492
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,903
Emily, thanks, really,
it's my pleasure.

493
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:14,211
If you insist.
If you don't mind terribly,

494
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:17,592
I need someone to make sure that the
path to the front door is shoveled.

495
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:19,363
Mother, stop.

496
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:23,153
Hello?

497
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,952
Oh, hello.
You got my message about the fish.

498
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,642
Sorry. We're all a little...

499
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:30,020
She read an article about how
fish can prevent heart attacks.

500
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:31,761
Now she thinks it's
the key to everything.

501
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,870
Well, fish is good.

502
00:20:33,888 --> 00:20:34,723
Yeah.

503
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,380
All right, I should get going.

504
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:38,473
Okay. Well, thanks.

505
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:41,433
Yes! Goodbye!

506
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:44,070
Another incompetent.
Lorelai, go get Luke back.

507
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:45,821
I need him to bring a
check for the fish man.

508
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:47,762
Mom, I'm not getting Luke.
He's done enough already.

509
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:49,542
Why don't you reschedule the
fish man for later in the week.

510
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:50,791
Because this is important.

511
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:52,723
It's important to have fish
at the house right now?

512
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:55,520
Logan and I can go meet the fish
man with a check if you want.

513
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:56,872
Oh, that would be marvelous.

514
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:59,820
Okay. I also want to get some of grandpa's
stuff so he has it when he wakes up.

515
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:01,260
- Wait, I'll do that.
- Do what?

516
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:03,002
You pay the fish man,
and I'll get grandpa's stuff.

517
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:04,783
Oh mom, that's silly.
They're in the same place.

518
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,981
Yes, but then we'll both have a job.
You have a job and I have a job.

519
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,013
Yeah, but going to
grandpa's is one job.

520
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,423
Somebody needs to stay here
and look after grandma.

521
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:12,572
Fine.

522
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,720
- I mean, if you really want --
- No, she's my mother.

523
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:17,252
- Well, you're my mother.
- Exactly. It's a tangled web.

524
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:18,520
Here you go, Logan.

525
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:21,030
Now have him put the salmon,
the swordfish, the king mackerel,

526
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,413
and the tuna in the
downstairs freezer

527
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:26,930
and the trout, sea bass, snapper,
and bluefish in the butler's pantry.

528
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:29,340
Salmon, swordfish,
king mackerel, tuna downstairs.

529
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:31,831
Trout, sea bass, snapper,
bluefish upstairs.

530
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:34,730
If you rode in the ambulance,
you and I don't have a car here.

531
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:36,842
Take it before I change my mind.
Level 3.

532
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:37,852
Thanks. Bye.

533
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:39,383
Bye. I'll be here doing my job.

534
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:40,473
How come you don't have a car?

535
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,320
Well, I came by
chopper, actually.

536
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:44,240
Chopper motorcycle or
chopper helicopter?

537
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:45,021
Helicopter.

538
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:47,242
- You came here in a helicopter?
- Yep.

539
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:51,182
Oh, I do need to call Quentin. I wonder
if they have a fax machine here.

540
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:52,792
And I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

541
00:21:52,806 --> 00:21:55,652
I don't know. Probably.
I should be. Don't feel hungry.

542
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:57,711
All right. Then we should get something
to eat. But first, I want to see

543
00:21:57,747 --> 00:22:01,553
if those addled nurses will allow
me to use their fax machine.

544
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:12,001
Hello?

545
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:14,040
Lorelai, it's me -- Babette.

546
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:16,273
- How you doing, sweetie?
- Oh, hey. I'm okay.

547
00:22:16,286 --> 00:22:17,590
What's the news with your dad?

548
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:20,210
Well, he's in surgery right now,
but we think he's gonna be okay.

549
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:22,571
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
Don't you worry about a thing.

550
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:25,203
He's a very vital man, your dad --
lots of chi, you know?

551
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:27,680
Oh... really?
I didn't know you noticed his chi.

552
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:30,033
Are you kidding me?
Prana, chi, life force --

553
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:32,601
whatever you call it,
your daddy's got it in spades.

554
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:35,430
Sexy men like him often do.
That's what makes them so sexy.

555
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:37,550
- They're ripe with life.
- O-kay.

556
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:40,030
- He's gonna be fine.
- Thanks, Babette.

557
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:43,310
He's like Warren Beatty, your dad --
or Sean Connery

558
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:45,851
or -- who's that one
I always found so sexy?

559
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:49,001
The evil politician with the glasses --
Henry Kissinger!

560
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,230
Oh, yeah, I know him.

561
00:22:50,248 --> 00:22:52,982
You might not agree with his politics.
You might have lived through Vietnam

562
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,891
and thought,
"that man is the devil,"

563
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:57,991
but you can't deny he's sexy.
You know why? Chi.

564
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,932
I get it. So, how's Paul Anka?

565
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:02,720
Oh, yeah, he's great,
just great.

566
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:03,602
What's wrong?

567
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:06,032
- I don't want to bother you.
- Go ahead.

568
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:08,670
Oh, nothing to worry about.
It's just...

569
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,683
I'm afraid his
bladder's gonna explode.

570
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:12,611
I can't get him
to come with me.

571
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:16,290
I'm sure he needs to relieve himself,
but it's a no-go. He's a no-go.

572
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:18,571
Oh Babette, I should've told you,
he's probably afraid of the porch steps.

573
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,230
You just have to lay
something down for him.

574
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:22,283
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

575
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:31,053
Wow! Yeah,
that worked great. Wow.

576
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:33,323
He's got some chi of his own,
this one.

577
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:35,202
- Ooh. Only problem is...
- What?

578
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:38,442
Nothing, nothing. It's just a little
cold without my coat, that's all.

579
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,810
Not your concern.

580
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:42,602
So, sweetie, if you need anything else,
you'll call me?

581
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:44,232
- Okay, I'll call you.
- Okay.

582
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:45,630
Give my love to your father.

583
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:48,051
I will, Babette.
Hey, thanks for calling.

584
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:49,980
Oh, sure thing, hon. Bye.

585
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,761
Uh-huh, right.

586
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:54,392
No, it's not a problem. It's perfectly
understandable. So from there,

587
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:57,523
you wanna take a right on Sycamore,
left onto old Sawbrook, and then...

588
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:58,821
That's right.

589
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:02,181
No, I mean a left into the driveway.
I mean that's correct --

590
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:05,060
making a left.
I mean, a left is the correct choice.

591
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,062
Right.

592
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,680
That's correct, I mean.

593
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,683
Okay, great. Great.
We'll be here. See you soon.

594
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:14,043
Sounds like Abbott and Costello got
nothing on you and the fish man.

595
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:16,482
You liked the "right/right" business?
It could use polish,

596
00:24:16,495 --> 00:24:18,592
but me and the fish man have
plans to bring back vaudeville.

597
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,182
Oh, I'm gonna book the Palace
Theater. Logan and the fish man.

598
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:22,951
- The fish man and Logan.
- He gets top billing?

599
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:24,423
He's the one who can juggle.

600
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:27,442
Anyway, so the snow delayed him,
but he should be here in 15 minutes.

601
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:29,510
Okay, I think your Blackberry
is going to explode.

602
00:24:29,528 --> 00:24:31,751
It's business stuff --
nothing that can't keep.

603
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,133
Business stuff, huh?

604
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:35,930
Business stuff that has to do
with the chopper you flew in on?

605
00:24:35,946 --> 00:24:37,542
We don't have to
talk about it now.

606
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:40,451
Oh, come on, I'm interested.
I want to know.

607
00:24:40,465 --> 00:24:42,933
And also,
I could really use the distraction.

608
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:45,352
Besides, I want to make sure
you haven't stolen a chopper.

609
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:47,983
I didn't steal it. It was loaned
to me by a hedge-fund manager.

610
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:48,740
Ohh, well...

611
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:51,930
I was at his country home in Montauk
when you called, and he just...

612
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,663
Loaned you his chopper,
as they say.

613
00:24:53,678 --> 00:24:54,613
Pretty much.

614
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,160
Well, I think loaning
someone your chopper

615
00:24:57,175 --> 00:24:59,720
is a sign of trust
in many cultures.

616
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:01,002
That sounds like a good sign.

617
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:02,703
Yeah, I think it
is a good sign.

618
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,651
So, come on.
What do you need funding for?

619
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:06,820
Just tell me something.
I don't want to be nosy,

620
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:08,833
but I'm really interested.
Come on. Come on.

621
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:12,483
Okay, you asked for
it so here it goes.

622
00:25:12,497 --> 00:25:14,203
I want to buy another
internet company.

623
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:15,111
I see.

624
00:25:15,126 --> 00:25:18,191
It's a web-based, interactive-media
platform. This guy in Austin created it

625
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:21,463
and it's amazing, fast,
and so easy to use, even I can use it.

626
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:23,680
The idea is to build on
the web presence we have

627
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:26,672
and turn into a user-generated
media hub where the members can

628
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:29,143
share videos, articles,
ideas, anything.

629
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:30,451
That sounds like a good idea.

630
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:32,182
Yeah, and it's a deal, too.

631
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:34,951
The guy who created this platform
is such a true blue computer geek,

632
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,223
he just wants to get started on his
next project, so he's willing to sell

633
00:25:37,258 --> 00:25:39,451
- for only $5 million.
- Oh, only.

634
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:42,122
I know. I know. But in this world,
that's relatively cheap.

635
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:46,081
Chad Hurley and Steve Chen sold
Youtube for $1.65 billion,

636
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:48,350
and who knows how much Mark
Zuckerberg will get for facebook?

637
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:49,962
Yeah, comparatively.

638
00:25:49,978 --> 00:25:52,930
Anyway, so I'm planning on putting
up $3 million of my own money.

639
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:55,530
And I'm just trying to line up a fund
to kick in the other $2 million.

640
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:56,612
You have $3 million?

641
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,680
Yeah, in my trust fund.

642
00:25:57,698 --> 00:25:59,080
Yeah, but I thought this
was a business thing.

643
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:01,363
I mean, haven't you asked your dad?
I thought you were working for him.

644
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:03,852
I went to him. I pitched him the idea,
and he rejected it.

645
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:06,523
I have to move fast. I have to
take this deal off the market

646
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:09,500
before one of the big-dog companies
sniff me out and try to outbid me.

647
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:10,942
You still want to take
this chess thing?

648
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:12,520
Yeah, we should.

649
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:15,293
Well, you sound really excited.

650
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:16,871
I am. It's exciting.

651
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:18,553
The economies of
scale are incredible.

652
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:20,370
I just need to prove out
the business model first.

653
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:22,842
Yeah, and the barriers to switching
for your current clientele

654
00:26:22,877 --> 00:26:24,090
will probably increase, too.

655
00:26:24,108 --> 00:26:26,260
Yeah exactly.
That what my father doesn't understand.

656
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:28,832
The opportunity cost of not doing
it is that somebody else will,

657
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:30,661
and the barriers
to switching --

658
00:26:30,675 --> 00:26:32,533
- Hey.
- What?

659
00:26:32,545 --> 00:26:35,632
Are you using business-speak with me?
Are we speaking businessese?

660
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,663
I believe we are.

661
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:37,911
Color me impressed.

662
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:39,491
I take economics.

663
00:26:39,508 --> 00:26:40,963
Sure, with professor Gilmore.

664
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:44,311
Yeah. We learned about ideal
business theory last semester.

665
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:46,670
I'm actualy really enjoying his class.
I've learned a lot.

666
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:49,082
He's a really good teacher,
which isn't always a given, you know.

667
00:26:49,118 --> 00:26:52,320
Some smart people can't translate
their smarts to other people,

668
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:54,460
but he is really good
at explaining things,

669
00:26:54,477 --> 00:26:56,002
and he makes you
want to learn more.

670
00:26:56,018 --> 00:26:58,260
Like next week,
we're gonna split up into 10 groups,

671
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:00,230
and each of us have to
create a business plan.

672
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:01,582
- Like "The Apprentice."
- Yeah.

673
00:27:01,597 --> 00:27:04,992
And he's gonna be like Donald Trump,
which is ridiculous.

674
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:08,732
Actually, we don't know what's
gonna go on next week, do we?

675
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:10,431
I guess not.

676
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:13,843
But it's good --
you got him a bunch of stuff to read.

677
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:17,531
I can hardly tell
what anything is.

678
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,291
Look at that pale,
misshapen thing.

679
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,981
Is that a sandwich or
a piece of chicken?

680
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:22,390
Maybe it's a chicken sandwich.

681
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:23,610
Oh no, it's quiche.

682
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:24,942
That's a quiche?

683
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:27,782
That blobby, white thing is
supposedly quiche lorraine?

684
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:30,331
It doesn't say "quiche lorraine."
Maybe it's "quiche blobby white thing."

685
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:32,332
The audacity of charging
money for this.

686
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:33,521
It's hospital food.

687
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:34,581
What's that supposed to mean?

688
00:27:34,615 --> 00:27:35,682
I'm just saying it's a clich�.

689
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:36,590
What is?

690
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:37,862
Hospital food being bad.

691
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:39,563
- Exactly.
- What?

692
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,441
It's a clich� for a reason.
Clich�s are true things

693
00:27:42,456 --> 00:27:44,332
that people are
tired of being true.

694
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:47,721
Like, "a penny saved is a penny
earned." Well it is, invested wisely.

695
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:49,061
I don't think that's
a clich�, mom.

696
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:50,562
What do you mean?
Of course it's a clich�.

697
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:53,182
It's not a clich�.
That's more an overused saying, like

698
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:55,593
"I'm sweating bullets" or
"it's as cold as ice."

699
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,442
Some overused sayings are true,

700
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,591
like "children should
be seen and not heard."

701
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:01,000
"Mother knows best."

702
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:03,933
"If you don't have anything nice to say,
don't say anything at all."

703
00:28:06,777 --> 00:28:08,081
Hello?

704
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,471
Oh, Quentin, hello.

705
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:14,133
No, I'm not busy at all.
You haven't interrupted a thing.

706
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:16,752
Thank you for returning
my call so promptly.

707
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:19,053
Oh, that's very kind, Quentin.

708
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,090
That's right. Yes.

709
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:23,450
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

710
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,893
Listen, it's been a while since
I've seen some of the paperwork.

711
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,661
I was wondering if you could fax some
things over here to the hospital.

712
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,220
I think I have
access to a machine.

713
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:35,853
The first thing I'd like
you to fax is his will.

714
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:39,021
That's right -- both the standard
will and the living will.

715
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,892
Well, I'm not sure about the
DNR provisions he established.

716
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,413
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Thank you, Quentin.

717
00:28:45,428 --> 00:28:46,900
Talk to you soon. Bye.

718
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:49,412
Mom, what was that?

719
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,853
Do we like this table, or is it too
close to that man with the I.V.?

720
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:55,400
Honestly, shouldn't there be a
separate dining area for sick people?

721
00:28:55,438 --> 00:28:56,392
That doesn't seem right.

722
00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:59,322
Mother, you're getting
dad's will faxed here?

723
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:00,193
Yes.

724
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,433
Why? You need to
read it right now?

725
00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:03,241
Well, yes.

726
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:05,671
You want to make sure he left
you the Mercedes and the Jag?

727
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:08,302
I don't care what you think.
I'm being pragmatic.

728
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:11,130
You know what?
I'm not hungry anymore.

729
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:20,253
- You like that, right?
- Yeah, that's a good one.

730
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:22,241
Yeah, all right.

731
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,313
Here's this.
I also found a bunch of his albums --

732
00:29:26,326 --> 00:29:28,131
Bobby Short singing
Cole Porter,

733
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,913
a couple of his favorite
Gershwin ones --

734
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:32,340
"Rhapsody in blue" and
"An american in Paris" --

735
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:35,290
also a couple of
Scott Joplin records,

736
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:37,953
although Scott Joplin might be a
little zazzly for the hospital.

737
00:29:37,966 --> 00:29:40,561
Yeah, I don't know what their
policy about ragtime is.

738
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:43,322
Oh, I also found "Chuck
Berry at the Fillmore,"

739
00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:45,841
which I gave him for
his 60th birthday.

740
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:49,353
Also, a little Schubert and Debussy,
which should be nice and relaxing.

741
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:51,751
Although I didn't find the
Bing Crosby album I wanted.

742
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:54,240
It's with his son Gary.
It's this song called

743
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:56,790
"When you and I were young, Maggie
blues." And when grandpa hears it,

744
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,740
he sings along and says,
"I always wanted to be a crooner."

745
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,230
Maggie blues?
You want me to help you look?

746
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:03,820
Well, I looked. I looked in
two closets and under a couch,

747
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:05,462
and all I found was the sleeve.

748
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:08,690
I mean, I could take it just for
decoration, but then it might underline

749
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:10,280
the fact that we don't
have "Maggie blues."

750
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:11,800
- I'd bring it.
- Yeah?

751
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:14,510
Yeah. So the fish man successfully
unloaded all the fish

752
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:15,932
per your grandmother's request.

753
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,770
Oh good. And everything
worked out with the check?

754
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:20,543
Yep, the fish man was happy because
I laughed at his C.O.D. joke.

755
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,110
- Hmm?
- C-O-D -- Cod.

756
00:30:24,496 --> 00:30:26,342
Yeah, just like that.

757
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:28,100
That fish man,
he's a funny one.

758
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,563
Believe me, I know.
I'm Hardy to his Laurel.

759
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,320
Okay, we have a deck of cards,
we have the chessboard.

760
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:35,360
We have what I think
is a backgammon set.

761
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,591
I grabbed grandma two outfits,

762
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:39,802
I grabbed her a pair of pants because
I wanted her to be comfortable,

763
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,853
but then I thought that
might be offensive to her.

764
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,862
- Offensive how?
- I have no idea.

765
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,573
Then I grabbed a skirt, but that opened
up the whole stockings, pantyhose,

766
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,752
"going through my grandma's
underwear drawer" can of worms.

767
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:52,961
And each outfit needs a different
top and a different pair of shoes.

768
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,710
Do you want to know who
rivals Imelda Marcos?

769
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:56,661
- Emily Gilmore?
- It's unbelievable.

770
00:30:56,678 --> 00:30:58,950
No biped needs to have
that many pairs of shoes.

771
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:00,812
Do you know what else
I wanted to grab?

772
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,430
By grandpa's bed,
there is a bookmarked copy

773
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,102
of "A monetary history
of the United States."

774
00:31:05,135 --> 00:31:06,841
Because who doesn't
love Milton Friedman?

775
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:09,673
Milton Friedman's on the syllabus,
so I thought maybe he'd want it.

776
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:11,522
- Hey!
- What's that?

777
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,641
Bing Crosby and Gary Crosby.

778
00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:14,601
Oh, no way!

779
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:16,110
It was in the wrong sleeve.

780
00:31:16,127 --> 00:31:17,691
He can croon with
"Maggie blues."

781
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,813
Oh, perfect.

782
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:20,563
All right, I'm gonna start
loading this stuff in the car.

783
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:21,801
Okay.

784
00:31:22,565 --> 00:31:24,231
- Logan?
- Yes?

785
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:26,580
Thank you.
Thank you so much for everything.

786
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,440
Of course.
But you don't have to thank me.

787
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:30,550
There's nowhere
else I'd rather be.

788
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:40,282
There you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

789
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:42,460
- Oh, yeah?
- I just got these faxed --

790
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,042
Mom, please, can we drop this?

791
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:46,143
I need to verify your
social-security number.

792
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,202
I don't want to give you my
social-security number right now.

793
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:49,993
Why don't you help me pick
out a little gift for dad.

794
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:52,633
What do you think I'm trying to do,
run a con, steal your identity?

795
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:55,093
No mom, I've just had enough of
talking about social securities

796
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:56,513
and wills, okay?

797
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:59,633
Your father's lawyer faxed
these over from the bank,

798
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:01,273
and I need your
social-security number.

799
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,832
You have got to be kidding me.

800
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:03,920
What would I be kidding about?

801
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:06,581
You're acting like dad is dead.
Dad is not dead.

802
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:09,391
Lorelai, six years ago,
when your father was in the hospital,

803
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:11,150
we were completely unprepared,

804
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:13,781
and we agreed to never
let that happen again.

805
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,991
So we made a plan,

806
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:17,371
and I am simply following
through on the plan.

807
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:20,391
So your plan was to chat up
Persephone's to make sure

808
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,402
you don't lose your
special table and to order

809
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:26,231
tons of swordfish and salmon
to keep your skin glowing

810
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:29,091
and to happily
discuss with Quentin

811
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:31,070
whether or not dad
should be resuscitated?

812
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:33,261
These are things that
need to be dealt with.

813
00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:35,770
No, what has to be dealt with
is that dad could be dying.

814
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:38,210
What you're dealing with is
phone calls and a checklist.

815
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:40,240
You're not his secretary, mom.
You're his wife.

816
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:42,812
Yes. And what do you
know about being a wife?

817
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,303
You've been married for what --
40 days? That's nothing.

818
00:32:45,318 --> 00:32:47,740
Your father and I have been
married for over 40 years.

819
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:51,093
For 2/3 of my life,
I have been the wife of Richard Gilmore.

820
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:53,283
I run his household.
I plan his meals.

821
00:32:53,298 --> 00:32:56,373
I buy his clothes,
I entertain his business associates.

822
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:58,573
When he loses his reading glasses,
I find them.

823
00:32:58,587 --> 00:33:00,560
When he wants a nightcap.
I make it for him.

824
00:33:00,575 --> 00:33:02,901
If he can't remember the
name of a colleague's wife,

825
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:04,311
I whisper it in his ear.

826
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,430
That's what I do --
I take care of him.

827
00:33:06,448 --> 00:33:08,230
That's my job. That's who I am.

828
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:11,510
If I could be performing his surgery
right now, I would be, but I can't --

829
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:13,071
it's out of my hands.

830
00:33:13,088 --> 00:33:16,721
It's out of my hands,
and there's nothing I can do but wait.

831
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:20,043
I could lose him, Lorelai.

832
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:22,550
He's my whole life,

833
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:25,243
and there's nothing I can do!

834
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:26,603
Mom.

835
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,822
I'm sorry.
This is inappropriate.

836
00:33:28,835 --> 00:33:30,961
No, it's not. It's fine.

837
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:32,753
Oh, god, I'm a mess.

838
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,152
Did you just take those?

839
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:43,272
Don't worry about it.
Pay for it later.

840
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:49,062
Just a few more?

841
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:50,921
They're good, right?

842
00:33:50,935 --> 00:33:52,730
They stick in your teeth.

843
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:54,703
But, yes, they are good.

844
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:55,831
Are there any more?

845
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:57,162
Are you kidding? There's a ton.

846
00:33:57,176 --> 00:33:59,881
- Not too many.
- Oh mom, there's no such thing.

847
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:01,893
I wonder why they
call them "Duds."

848
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:03,160
I don't know. Do you guys know?

849
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:03,930
Nope.

850
00:34:03,947 --> 00:34:05,651
I could make something up,
but no.

851
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:09,032
Seems a rather counterintuitive
name for a type of candy.

852
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,760
So, he's out of surgery,
and it went extremely well.

853
00:34:12,778 --> 00:34:14,181
His recovery won't
be immediate.

854
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:16,240
He still has several days
here at the hospital.

855
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:20,200
But we can go over that later.
He's groggy now and tired.

856
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:22,433
After he gets some rest,
you can all visit with him, but for now,

857
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:24,662
maybe just his wife.

858
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:26,863
Thank you, doctor.

859
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,353
Tell dad "hi" from us, mom.

860
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,890
I will, Lorelai.

861
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:41,821
Everything's in order, you'll be
glad to know. I called Harold Larkin

862
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:44,020
and the chairman of the
economics department.

863
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:46,952
They both send their best
wishes for a speedy recovery.

864
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:49,821
I canceled our dinner reservations
for the next couple of weeks.

865
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,153
Oh, and I sent regrets
to Sarah Osgood,

866
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:55,153
who's hosting the D.A.R.
spring fling this year.

867
00:34:55,165 --> 00:34:59,611
I left word for the Sudburys that we
won't be able to host bridge this week.

868
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:01,102
Uh, what else?

869
00:35:01,115 --> 00:35:03,261
Oh, and I've been in
touch with Quentin.

870
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:05,470
He's been kept abreast
of the whole situation.

871
00:35:05,488 --> 00:35:08,543
And I bought fish,
Richard, so much fish --

872
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:12,130
Tuna and trout and
snapper and salmon and --

873
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:14,101
Sounds just fine, Emily.

874
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,783
That sounds just fine.

875
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:34,641
Hi, it's me -- again.
Um, dad's out of surgery,

876
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:38,620
and it went well,
and he's doing fine, so...

877
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:43,352
It's good news. I just --
I wanted you to know...

878
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:45,752
because... I don't know why.

879
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:47,721
'Cause you haven't
returned any of my calls.

880
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:52,202
But I just thought I would,
uh, tell you what's going on

881
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:56,033
because... I'm your wife and...

882
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,481
I think that's what
I'm supposed to do.

883
00:35:58,496 --> 00:36:00,862
No idea how to be your wife,
but I'm trying.

884
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:03,090
You're my husband,
you know, and...

885
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:05,451
it seems like you should
be here or call me back.

886
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:08,411
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's
what married people do,

887
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:09,852
is be there for each other.

888
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:12,420
But I know you're upset,
and I know we had a fight,

889
00:36:12,435 --> 00:36:14,263
but this is just bigger than that,
you know?

890
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:16,941
It's my dad,
and he's had a heart attack.

891
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,891
and everybody's been here.

892
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:22,441
I mean, I've talked to Sookie and
even Michel and Patty and Babette,

893
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:25,240
and they've all been
here for me, but...

894
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:30,981
my husband's... not here.

895
00:36:32,308 --> 00:36:34,330
That's not okay,
Chris, you know?

896
00:36:34,345 --> 00:36:35,852
It's not okay.

897
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:42,173
Here we go --

898
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,730
a little "Maggie blues."

899
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:56,401
That is Bing and Gary Crosby.

900
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:58,311
Why doesn't anybody name
their kid "Bing" anymore?

901
00:36:58,348 --> 00:36:59,231
You could have named me "Bing."

902
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:00,671
I thought about it.
You didn't look like a Bing.

903
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,132
I don't even know if
I should be insulted.

904
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:04,190
I wish I were a crooner.

905
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:07,651
I also brought
you some Gershwin,

906
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,500
some Chuck Berry,
and the Andrews sisters.

907
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:11,331
Ooh, and some Milton Friedman.

908
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:12,950
The guy who sang
"Spirit in the sky"?

909
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,333
No, that was Norman Greenbaum.

910
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:18,910
No, Milton Friedman's the economist
who won the Nobel prize in the '70.

911
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:21,111
I figured, when you're sick of
reading sir Arthur Conan Doyle,

912
00:37:21,148 --> 00:37:23,301
you can pick up a little
Friedman for a real mystery

913
00:37:23,316 --> 00:37:27,842
and deduce the disadvantages of government
intervention in economic policy.

914
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:31,071
What do you say, dad --
here or Philadelphia?

915
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:32,231
What's the call?

916
00:37:32,246 --> 00:37:35,381
I don't think I'd like
to be in Philadelphia.

917
00:37:35,397 --> 00:37:37,350
I think I'd rather
be in New Haven.

918
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:38,621
Yeah, it's okay here.

919
00:37:38,638 --> 00:37:40,800
We can import cream
cheese and cheesesteaks

920
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:42,993
and any other kind of cheese.

921
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:45,191
You look good, dad.

922
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:48,531
This outfit's not up to your usual J.
Press standards,

923
00:37:48,548 --> 00:37:51,763
unless it's got some brass
buttons I can't see, but...

924
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:53,233
you look good.

925
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,122
You look tall.

926
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:57,713
I think I'm just gonna...

927
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:00,232
close my eyes for...

928
00:38:01,497 --> 00:38:03,361
just a little minute.

929
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:07,402
Is he asleep?

930
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:08,882
I think so.

931
00:38:09,007 --> 00:38:11,001
Should we draw a
mustache on him?

932
00:38:11,017 --> 00:38:13,563
- He's already got a mustache.
- Oh, yeah.

933
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:17,211
- The music's nice.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

934
00:38:19,036 --> 00:38:20,322
Hey, Rory?

935
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:21,670
Hey, mom?

936
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:24,172
You know, I'm glad to see
you doing so well with Logan.

937
00:38:24,187 --> 00:38:25,571
I'm happy that you're happy.

938
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:27,000
Thanks.

939
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:30,311
He's not half bad, that kid.
He's almost okay.

940
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:31,892
Yeah, he's all right.

941
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,381
- Hey, uh, mom?
- Hey, uh, Rory?

942
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:40,420
Um, do you...
know where dad is?

943
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:43,100
No, hon.

944
00:38:43,826 --> 00:38:47,191
For all I know,
maybe he's in Philadelphia.

945
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:52,063
So we should be able to move him
out of the C.I.C.U. in 24 hours.

946
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:55,072
If everything goes as planned,
he should be home in five or six days.

947
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:56,953
Everything will go as planned.
I'm sure of it.

948
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,861
If you like, I can show you the room
where we'll be moving Richard tomorrow.

949
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:01,762
Absolutely. Does
it have a window?

950
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:04,440
The room he's in has a window so small,
it's almost a peephole.

951
00:39:04,456 --> 00:39:06,770
I believe it does
have a window.

952
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:09,432
- Go ahead. I'll be right there.
- Okay, mom.

953
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:13,461
Just be careful of this bag here,
'cause it's leaking a little bit.

954
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:14,491
Hey, you're back.

955
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:17,330
Oh. Hey.
I didn't want to bug you.

956
00:39:17,346 --> 00:39:20,170
I just wanted to drop off some
food for you guys and get going.

957
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:21,543
Luke, you didn't
have to do that.

958
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:25,812
It's all right. I wanted to
make some stuff anyway, so...

959
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:28,452
All right,
I'm gonna get out of here now.

960
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:30,813
He's okay.
The surgery went well.

961
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,553
Oh, that's terrific.
That is such good news.

962
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:36,323
He doing really well. They think he'll
be able to go home in a couple days.

963
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:39,290
Oh, that's so good. Yeah.

964
00:39:39,308 --> 00:39:41,140
So, how's he looking?

965
00:39:41,157 --> 00:39:43,642
Um... he looks good...

966
00:39:43,656 --> 00:39:45,603
big... tall.

967
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:48,623
That's good. Yeah, he's tall.
He's a big man.

968
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:50,590
He is a big, tall man.

969
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:53,092
- Oh, excuse me.
- Can I help you?

970
00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:54,780
Yeah, I'm looking
for Richard Gilmore.

971
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:56,890
- And you are?
- I'm his son-in-law.

972
00:39:56,905 --> 00:40:00,092
Okay. He's in room b-10.
It's just down the hall.

973
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,801
Take a right at the
nurses' station.

974
00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:03,770
- Is he, uh...
- The surgery went really well.

975
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,422
He's resting comfortably.
He's gonna be fine.

976
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:07,200
Okay. Good.
All right, so down the hall, right?

977
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:08,563
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

978
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:12,093
Okay, so, look, I got a couple of
burgers, assortment of sandwiches.

979
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:15,030
There's some salads just in case all of
the sudden you want to eat some salad.

980
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,982
All right, couple pieces of pie,
half a dozen chocolate-chip cookies,

981
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:20,222
and, of course,
there is the fish bag.

982
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:21,512
You brought a fish bag?

983
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:23,891
I heard somebody
talking about fish.

984
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:26,942
There's two fillets, okay,
lobster roll, fish tacos,

985
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,852
two tuna-fish sandwiches,

986
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:31,603
some fried fish,
and fish sticks.

987
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:33,503
- Hi. You're here.
- I'm here.

988
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:34,632
All right, I'm gonna get going.

989
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,573
Yeah, you should.

990
00:40:39,295 --> 00:40:41,521
I'm glad your dad's doing good.

991
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:48,122
Why didn't you call me?
I didn't think you were coming.

992
00:40:48,138 --> 00:40:49,240
Clearly.

993
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:51,291
No, he just brought food.
I didn't call him.

994
00:40:51,306 --> 00:40:53,312
I don't want to talk about this --
not now.

995
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,362
Dad. Hey.

996
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,961
Christopher, I'm so
glad you're here.

997
00:40:56,977 --> 00:41:00,280
Of course, of course.
I'm so glad to hear that Richard's okay.

998
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:01,981
- How you doing, kiddo?
- I'm okay.

999
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:04,021
I think we're gonna go visit
grandpa again. Do you want to come?

1000
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:05,371
I'm sure he'd be
happy to see you.

1001
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:07,983
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Okay, come on.

1002
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:17,360
It'll be all right.

1003
00:41:17,615 --> 00:41:20,161
Every cloud has
a silver lining.

1004
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:21,841
Thanks, mom.

1005
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:24,582
Well, blood is
thicker than water.

1006
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:36,423
