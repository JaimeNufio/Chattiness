1
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:05,577
Hey.

2
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:06,976
Hey.

3
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:08,971
What are you doing?

4
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:12,702
Um... go back to sleep.

5
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:15,205
Come back to bed.

6
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:18,141
Oh, I can't. I got to go.

7
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:19,233
Stay.

8
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:21,727
No, I can't -- Paul Anka.

9
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:23,548
Oh, there's no way he's
performing this early.

10
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:24,385
Check your tickets.

11
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:25,763
No, I got to go
home and feed him.

12
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,299
Well, let me make
you breakfast first.

13
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:28,076
No.

14
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,088
Come on, you're no good to Paul
Anka if you collapse from hunger

15
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,198
before you feed him. It's like how,
when you're on an airplane,

16
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:34,193
you put on your own oxygen
mask before your kids.

17
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,363
- It seems selfish, but --
- No.

18
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:41,310
Chris.

19
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:42,413
Lore.

20
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:43,681
Really.

21
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:45,128
You sleep.

22
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:46,478
I got to get going.

23
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,176
- You sure?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,988
Okay. Bye.

25
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,127
- You're back!
- Ohh! God, Babette, you scared me.

26
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:57,419
Yeah, it's my voice.
It frightens the hell out of people.

27
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:58,618
I don't know what
to do about it.

28
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:01,053
Well, you could start by not
hiding in people's houses

29
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,530
and leaping at them
when they come home.

30
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:03,932
- It's the nodules.
- Who?

31
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:05,410
It's the nodules on
my vocal chords.

32
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:07,566
The more I strain my voice,
the more they grow.

33
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:10,109
It's nature's way of trying
to get me to talk softer.

34
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,516
Babette, one. Nature, nada.

35
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,599
I bet you're wondering
why I'm here.

36
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:16,093
Yeah. I mean, not that I'm not happy to
see you. It's just that I have to --

37
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:17,906
- I'm not a sleepwalker.
- No?

38
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,612
- In case that's what you were thinking.
- No no.

39
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:21,982
'Cause a lot of people figure
me for one, god knows why.

40
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:24,561
- I guess I got the look.
- Well, you didn't sleepwalk, though.

41
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:27,276
Huh-unh. But this morning
I came over here wide awake

42
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,702
'cause I heard Paul Anka doing
that weird yodeling noise

43
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,505
that you said he does when he's hungry,
so I fed him.

44
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:32,454
Oh good, thank you.

45
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:35,790
Yeah, I gave him a half a cup of
that kibble that you said he likes,

46
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:37,843
but then he looked at me like
I stole something from him,

47
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:38,983
so I gave him a whole cup.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,778
I know that look.
It can be intimidating.

49
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,658
And since our washing
machine is broken --

50
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,309
Morey put his boots in
it and broke it again --

51
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:46,131
I thought I'd do a
load of my intimates.

52
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:47,061
Good for you.

53
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:48,834
- You ain't got any messages.
- What?

54
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:50,377
- He didn't call.
- Who?

55
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:52,451
I heard about the fight
between you and Luke.

56
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,524
You did?

57
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:56,198
Yeah. You know Adrian
Bittenberg's daughter, Becky?

58
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,342
She got a huge mouth.

59
00:03:57,354 --> 00:04:00,092
- Becky is not a gossip.
- But she has a huge mouth.

60
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,105
And she and Eileen Whitewin
were behind Doose's market

61
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,647
seeing how many devil dogs
Becky could stuff in there,

62
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,216
and when she got up to four,
completely cut off her oxygen.

63
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:10,833
So Eileen went running over to Luke's
to see if she could get some help,

64
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,528
and then she saw the two of you in
the streets screaming at each other.

65
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:16,147
Well,  I'm glad she had the presence
of mind to listen in on our argument

66
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,605
while her friend was
choking to death.

67
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:20,118
Don't you worry about a thing, honey.
Everything will be fine.

68
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,430
Every couple needs a good
blowout once in a while.

69
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,596
- It keeps you on your toes.
- Oh, yeah, well...

70
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:27,724
Yeah. So, did you spend the
night at Sookie's again?

71
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:28,866
Sookie's?

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,160
Yeah, I figured you were there,

73
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:32,040
but Morey and I did a
power walk this morning,

74
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:34,668
and we went by her and Jackson's place,
and I didn't see your jeep there.

75
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:36,221
Babette, I really
got to get going.

76
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,646
Oh, I'm just waiting
for my panties to dry.

77
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,197
I'll pick them up later.

78
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:44,410
Okay, but could you do me a favor and
put them in a delicate-spin situation,

79
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:46,272
30 minutes with a
bounce dryer sheet?

80
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,794
Oh, and don't worry, sweetheart.
He'll call.

81
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,491
They always do.

82
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:09,297
Do you want your kid to spend her life
behind the counter at Dunkin' Donuts?

83
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:10,104
- Do you?
- No.

84
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:11,350
Because that's where
she's headed --

85
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:14,082
selling chocolate donuts and glazed
fritters for the next 40 years

86
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:17,317
to people in business suits who actually
gave a crap about their academic future.

87
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,069
I just want her to get
into a good school.

88
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:20,479
She has such potential.

89
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:21,593
So did Charles Manson.

90
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:23,040
- What?
- Look at her.

91
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,967
Frankly, it may
already be too late.

92
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:28,183
I don't particularly like to take
on such meek, diffident cases.

93
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:30,338
Do you even know what
"diffident" means?

94
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:32,525
That's okay.
That knowledge isn't really required

95
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:34,579
in the retail
doughnut-distribution industry.

96
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:35,903
Please, just give her a chance.

97
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,379
- Why should I?
- Because she needs this.

98
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:38,837
- Mom.
- Caitlyn.

99
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,571
- What do you think?
- She's got a "C" average,

100
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,709
which means she's
either lazy or stupid.

101
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:43,802
I can work with either.

102
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,407
Frankly, sometimes
stupid is easier.

103
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:48,119
I can scare the stupid out of you,
but the lazy runs deep.

104
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:49,778
- So you'll take her on?
- I will.

105
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:50,851
- Wonderful.
- Mom!

106
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:53,586
Caitlyn. Thank you, Paris.
You won't be sorry.

107
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,875
Okay. Now, if I can get you both
to take these aptitude tests,

108
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:57,911
then we can get to work.

109
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,265
Why do I need to take a test?

110
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:01,708
I need to get a realistic sense
of Caitlyn's true potential,

111
00:06:01,724 --> 00:06:04,087
and  genetics is by far the
most reliable indicator.

112
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:04,847
I'm sorry?

113
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:08,690
Basically,  I need to know how much of this
is her fault and how much of it is yours.

114
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:10,110
Ticktock.

115
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:13,660
What is this?

116
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:14,627
Pretty great, huh?

117
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:15,711
Not for Caitlyn.

118
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:17,860
I was gonna spend the summer
tutoring for the Princeton review,

119
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:20,526
but then I found they charge
these little morons $60 an hour

120
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:22,059
and only pay their tutors $20.

121
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:23,673
So I figured,
"who needs the Princeton review?"

122
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,015
I can open up my own shop.

123
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,277
I've already subcontracted out
to three other student tutors,

124
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,146
and I've got more
prospects lined up.

125
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,260
I'm gonna make a fortune.

126
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:32,619
Hey, are you interested?
The pay's $15 an hour.

127
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:33,426
No, thanks.

128
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,050
Wait. Are you looking to use
the offices over the summer?

129
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,857
Just because you're the editor,
that doesn't entitle you

130
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:40,446
to use the offices during the summer.
There's no paper to put out.

131
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,189
These were up for grabs,
and I grabbed them.

132
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:43,707
Paris, I don't
want the offices.

133
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,460
Oh. Then,
what are you doing here?

134
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:47,054
I just came in to
back up my files.

135
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,586
You already backed
up your files.

136
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,273
I saw you do it.

137
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,625
Oh. I get it.
Logan's gone, huh?

138
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,954
He left this morning, early.

139
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,575
- Breakups are tough.
- What?

140
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,351
Eyes on your own
paper, Marilyn!

141
00:06:58,363 --> 00:06:59,894
- We didn't break up.
- You didn't?

142
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,131
No. Why would you say that?

143
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:04,143
I don't know. Wealthy, good-looking,
hedonistic heir to billion-dollar,

144
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,416
multinational media
conglomerate moves to London

145
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:09,360
and spends nights pining away
for his college girlfriend?

146
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:10,903
Who's watching that movie?

147
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,725
Paris, it's not like that.
We're together.

148
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,869
So you guys talked about it?

149
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,324
Yes. Well, no --

150
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,564
I mean, I'm gonna go visit him, though.
We talked about that.

151
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,070
- When?
- I don't know exactly.

152
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,567
So what, specifically,
did you agree to?

153
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:25,835
Well, nothing, really,
but it was kind of understood.

154
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,339
Yeah. Because that worked
out so well the last time.

155
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:29,280
Paris.

156
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:30,601
Has history taught you nothing?

157
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,787
You're in limbo, sister,
no man's land, quite literally.

158
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:36,155
Logan is not that bright.
You need to spell it out for him.

159
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:37,825
He's got to know where
the red lines are,

160
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:40,923
or he's gonna leap right over them and
into bed with multiple british floozies.

161
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:42,647
Paris, it's okay.
Logan and I are fine.

162
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,527
He moved to London, Rory --
the most romantic city in the world.

163
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,193
Paris is the most romantic
city in the world.

164
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:50,319
Oh, right.
London is just the most sex-obsessed.

165
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:52,296
Pencil's down!

166
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:58,020
Hey.

167
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:03,442
I can't. I'm late for work.

168
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:04,274
Can we talk first?

169
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:05,366
Please, I really don't want to.

170
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,393
Lorelai, come on.

171
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:07,783
No, Luke, we did talk.

172
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:10,277
We talked last night.
There's nothing left to say.

173
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,925
I'm sorry about yesterday, but you
kind of ambushed me, out of nowhere,

174
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:14,334
and then you didn't
give me a chance.

175
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,458
I gave you every chance.

176
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,858
You were going so fast.

177
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:17,997
Yeah, that's me. I'm fast.

178
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:19,947
I'm the perfect storm of
caffeine and genetics.

179
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,325
I know, but now I've had a chance to
catch up, and I want to discuss it.

180
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:24,491
Discuss what?
There's nothing left to discuss.

181
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:26,363
Us -- you and me.

182
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:29,535
There is no us.
There's you, and there's me. It's over.

183
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,943
It was over last night,
and it's over now. It's over.

184
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,341
- Lorelai --
- No, I'm sorry. I have to go.

185
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,344
- You're going down.
- No.

186
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:49,559
You think you're so great.

187
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:51,670
- You think you're miss la-di-da.
- Ow.

188
00:08:51,686 --> 00:08:54,913
But look at you now,
all weak and pitiful.

189
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:57,148
That's it. Give in to the pain.

190
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,200
- So, how's my acting?
- What do you mean?

191
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:03,024
Well, is it believable, or do you
find it a little over-the-top?!

192
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,028
My fingers!
My fingers are smashed!

193
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,829
Ha! How do you like
them apples, Michel?

194
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,376
I do not like these apples.
You cheated.

195
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:10,939
You hustled me.
You played possum.

196
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:12,579
Oh, no, I played arm-wrestling.

197
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,064
Or did you think we were
playing some other game?

198
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:15,079
Is that why you lost so bad?

199
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:17,220
Your gloating is
very distasteful.

200
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:18,388
Ouch!

201
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:22,396
Lorelai, I may need to take some
time off to have my wrist x-rayed.

202
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:23,577
Excuse me.

203
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,976
I am the champion, my friend

204
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:28,852
And I'll keep on
fighting till the end

205
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,470
No time for losers

206
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:34,596
Oh! I am a
fantastic arm-wrestler.

207
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,612
You know what I think did it?
The whisking --

208
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:40,052
all those years of whiskin has given
me incredible forearm strength.

209
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:43,268
People are always like, "why take
the time to hand-whip fresh cream?

210
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,156
Why not use a machine?"

211
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,979
And I've always been like,
"I don't know why I do it.

212
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:49,913
It's just something that
I do." But now I know --

213
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:53,193
because I've been training
for this very day.

214
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,515
I mean, wow! I am strong.

215
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,065
And the omelet flipping
definitely is part of it.

216
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,202
You know when you use one of those
really heavy cast-iron skillets,

217
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:02,678
and you flip, flip?

218
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,654
I mean, that's all in the wrist,
you know?

219
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,101
And that's what they say.

220
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,098
You know, that's what people
say about arm-wrestling, too --

221
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,870
that  it's all in the wrist,

222
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:14,127
and, man, I have super-bionic,
superpowered, super wrists.

223
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:16,822
I mean,
who knew I possessed such --

224
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:18,148
Honey?

225
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,806
Something's wrong, huh?

226
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:20,554
Yeah.

227
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:22,589
It's not spiders
on the ceiling.

228
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,390
You know I hate spiders.

229
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:26,030
I was kind of hoping
it was spiders.

230
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:26,969
It's not spiders.

231
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:28,227
- No?
- No.

232
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,241
Okay.

233
00:10:29,258 --> 00:10:30,643
Luke and I are over.

234
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,262
- Over?
- Yeah.

235
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:33,818
- No.
- Yeah.

236
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:36,005
- You guys had a fight?
- We had the fight.

237
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:38,354
People have fights. It's okay.

238
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:40,625
It's good, actually.
You know, it's healthy.

239
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,361
If you don't have fights,
all these bad chemicals build up,

240
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:44,310
and you get ulcers
and bad skin.

241
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:46,427
You got such pretty skin,
so you have to have some fights

242
00:10:46,464 --> 00:10:47,770
for the sake of your skin.

243
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,212
This was different.
This was bad.

244
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:50,860
People have bad fights.

245
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,268
Every bad fight can
seem like "the fight."

246
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,492
It wasn't just a fight, Sookie.

247
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:58,310
It was him not fighting for me.

248
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:00,030
I gave him an ultimatum.

249
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,280
- And?
- And he let me walk away.

250
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:04,076
No. He'll come back.

251
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,908
He'll be back. He'll come back.

252
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:07,901
Luke wants to marry you.

253
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,495
I know he does.

254
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,304
I mean, he'll come around.
He'll get it together.

255
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:13,272
I'm done.

256
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:15,182
I don't want to see him anymore.
It's over.

257
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,177
I  get that you're mad.
You deserve to be mad.

258
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:19,324
Luke's been a real jerk.
Frankly, being mad at him

259
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,128
makes all the
sense in the world.

260
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:24,629
And if you're so mad that you need to
believe you guys are over, I get that.

261
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,387
Sookie, I spent the night
with Christopher last night.

262
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,109
You spent the night with
Christopher last night?

263
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,655
- Spent the night.
- With Christopher?

264
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:33,642
Yeah.

265
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:34,849
Okay. So, does Luke know?

266
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,864
No. I don't want
him to ever know.

267
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,101
That's good. That's good.

268
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:40,479
Uh, okay.

269
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,755
Uh, look -- things happen.

270
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,439
People... people do things.
It's not pretty.

271
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,492
It's not Disney,
but it's the real world.

272
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,901
And you don't have to tell him.

273
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,470
Luke doesn't have to know,
and things don't have to be over.

274
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:54,185
No, you don't get it.
I need it to be over.

275
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:57,715
I need it to be over because
I can't take this anymore.

276
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,208
Yes, I love Luke, and, yes,
I wanted to marry Luke.

277
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,065
But I didn't want a life
separate from Luke,

278
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,530
and that's all he could give me.
I don't want that.

279
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:07,738
If I'm gonna be with Luke,
I want to be with Luke,

280
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:11,152
and he didn't get it, and I waited.
I mean, god, I waited.

281
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,328
It's like Luke is
driving a car, okay,

282
00:12:13,343 --> 00:12:15,679
and I just want to be in
the passenger's seat.

283
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:17,386
But he's locked
the door, and...

284
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:20,164
and so I have to hold onto the bumper,
you know?

285
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,874
I'm not even asking him
to open the door for me.

286
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,550
Just leave it unlocked and say,
"come in."

287
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:26,630
But no, he didn't do that,
so I'm hanging onto the bumper,

288
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,327
and life goes on,
and the car goes on,

289
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,810
and I get really badly
bruised and hitting potholes.

290
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,613
And it hurts. I mean, it hurts.

291
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:38,050
So yesterday I had to let go of the
bumper because it hurts too much.

292
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,153
It hurts too much.

293
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:43,777
Okay.

294
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,864
- Caesar, where the hell is Lane?
- She's on her honeymoon.

295
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:54,146
- Jeez, how long is that gonna last?
- It's only been a week.

296
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:56,121
Only? Seven days seems
like plenty of time

297
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,490
to sit in some mountain cabin together
and realize you've just changed yourself

298
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:01,226
to another human being
for all eternity.

299
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,476
They went to Mexico, so they're
probably doing that on a beach.

300
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,835
Maybe it takes a little longer to realize,
you know, with the hot sun and all.

301
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,465
Ceasar, are you being funny?

302
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:10,259
- You tell me.
- No, you tell me.

303
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:12,166
- It would appear not.
- Bus those tables.

304
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,912
Luke, I asked for these eggs scrambled,
and they're sunny-side up.

305
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:18,593
There you go.

306
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:21,614
Oh, now what?

307
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,684
Caesar, I'll be right back.

308
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,071
Don't hurry.

309
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,560
Now, carefully. Carefully.

310
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,382
That's rental equipment.
I'm responsible for that.

311
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:33,468
Taylor, what the
hell are you doing?

312
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,846
Good morning, Lucas.
You look in fine fettle today.

313
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,476
Okay, whatever you're doing,
stop it.

314
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:39,566
That's rather cynical. Now, who's
to say I'm not doing something here

315
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:40,851
that will surprise
and delight you?

316
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:42,147
- Are you?
- I highly doubt it.

317
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:43,778
- Then stop it.
- Can't do it, Luke.

318
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,146
The safety of the citizens
of Stars Hollow is at stake,

319
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,756
and that has to be
my top priority,

320
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,078
regardless of how you feel
about a red-light camera.

321
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:50,980
A what?

322
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:54,711
To catch scofflaws. Apparently, people
are viewing our traffic light here

323
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,317
as more a series of colorful
driving suggestions

324
00:13:57,324 --> 00:13:58,902
rather than the
rules of the road.

325
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:01,797
Therefore, I decided to
install a red-light camera

326
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:04,693
to discourage drivers
who would test our laws

327
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:06,543
and photograph and
punish those who do.

328
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,598
A camera?

329
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,650
You run a red light, it's time
for your close-up, Mr. Demille.

330
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:12,692
These little wonders are
taking over the globe --

331
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,756
New York, Los Angeles,
Paris, Singapore.

332
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:15,637
That's ridiculous.

333
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:17,987
They're in position and ready for
the installation as you say so.

334
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,210
You can't do this.
It's an invasion of privacy.

335
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,315
Something to fear, Luke?

336
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,305
You can't take pictures of
people for driving by the diner.

337
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,743
It's probably not even legal.

338
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,365
Spoken like a man with
something to hide.

339
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,524
Luke, I can assure you that
I am well within my rights

340
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:31,405
as town selectman to
install that camera,

341
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,197
and you, of all people,
should be grateful.

342
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,891
After all, it'll make the street in
front of your diner that much safer.

343
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:37,166
Or unsafer,
if you know what I mean.

344
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,534
There hasn't been an accident
on that corner in 15 years.

345
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:41,752
And now we've made it safe
for the next 15. Hooray!

346
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:42,901
I'm gonna fight you
on this, Taylor.

347
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:45,809
We  will be having the official
unveiling ceremony later this afternoon.

348
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:46,890
You're welcome to attend.

349
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:49,615
I don't see how I can avoid it, considering
it's right in front of my damn diner!

350
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,599
I'll put you down for plus one.

351
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:54,430
Oh, and we're going to have to
cross up some electrical lines

352
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:55,707
during the
installation process,

353
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:58,008
so you might lose
power for a few hours.

354
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,373
Hi.

355
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:04,242
What?! The prodigal
daughter returns.

356
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:05,335
What are you doing here?

357
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,033
I couldn't stay away.
I just missed you too much.

358
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,993
Aren't you the sweetest?
Isn't she the sweetest, Michel?

359
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,239
Beyond all human understanding.

360
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,641
Hi, Michel.

361
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:16,545
Yes, it hurts very much.

362
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:18,177
Yay! So you're back.

363
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:20,305
Yeah. I just had to
get out of there.

364
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,868
Aw. How was the goodbye?

365
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:23,806
Awful. There's nothing
good about a goodbye.

366
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:26,700
It's a very poorly named ritual.
It was a bad bye, a very bad bye.

367
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:28,831
Then I went to the newsroom
to talk to Paris about it --

368
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:29,762
You what?

369
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:31,556
Well, I didn't mean to.
She was just there,

370
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,238
and she spent 10 minutes
kicking me while I was down.

371
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:36,674
Paris is always there for you
in the most unfortunate ways.

372
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:37,893
I just miss him so much.

373
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:38,823
I know you do.

374
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,536
And it's only been seven hours.
Can you imagine when it's been --

375
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:43,792
You know what? I don't want to
talk about it. I need coffee.

376
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,258
Okay. You sure, though,
you don't want to talk?

377
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:49,373
You can always vent to me.
I'm the perfect vent-erizer --

378
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:50,927
vent-erator.

379
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,323
Mom, I don't need a vent-erator.
I just don't want to talk about it.

380
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:55,906
What's going on with you?

381
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,763
Oh. With me?
Oh, well, things with me --

382
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:00,356
things with me are good.

383
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:01,583
Convincing.

384
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:04,083
Things with me friends are good.
Things with me Inn are good.

385
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,812
- Things with me, not so good.
- What's up?

386
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:07,306
Look, I don't want to talk
about this right now, okay?

387
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,271
But I want to tell you. I have to tell,
but I'm barely holding it together as it is.

388
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:12,792
So if I tell you, will you
promise not to make me discuss it?

389
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:14,154
What?

390
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:15,767
Luke and I split up.

391
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:17,291
What do you mean,
like you got into a fight?

392
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:19,785
No, like we had a breakup,
like a real-life parting of the hearts.

393
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:21,049
Why? What happened?

394
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:22,411
Rory, you promised.

395
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,075
No, I didn't.

396
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:24,952
- Well, it was implied. Please.
- Mom.

397
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,113
Rory, I don't want
to talk about it.

398
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:28,539
- But you have to explain.
- No, not right now, okay?

399
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,632
Look --
you got to not talk about your thing.

400
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:32,720
So I didn't vent-erator you.
You don't vent-erator me.

401
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:35,186
- But --
- Rory, please.

402
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:38,302
Well, you know, I guess we
don't have to talk about stuff.

403
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:41,144
Yeah. Who says we always
have to be talking?

404
00:16:41,156 --> 00:16:42,399
We can not talk.

405
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:43,558
Of course we can.

406
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:44,939
Okay.

407
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,107
We should probably talk about
how we're not gonna talk,

408
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,207
'cause I don't think we
should just go right into it.

409
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:50,944
Let's do something that
doesn't require talking.

410
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,246
Like, we could go
to the movies.

411
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:53,610
You want to try not
talking at a movie?

412
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:54,741
- Okay, shopping.
- Are you mad?

413
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:57,656
We could drink. We could go to
a bar and just throw back a few.

414
00:16:57,672 --> 00:16:59,477
Yeah, 'cause drunk people
never feel like talking.

415
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:01,034
Oh! We could go to a club.

416
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:03,151
Yeah, 'cause all the hot spots
get rolling right about lunchtime.

417
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:04,659
See? This is why
men play sports.

418
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,632
- Sports. We can play sports.
- We hate sports.

419
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:07,919
We haven't tried every sport.

420
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:08,866
How about running?

421
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:10,478
We could easily talk
while we're running.

422
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:11,861
Not if we were hurdling.

423
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,990
Hurdles require more focus and,
thus, less talking.

424
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:15,378
Or we could do that
kind of running

425
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:18,802
that's like you leap around
a tree and up a hill --

426
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,175
You want to run cross-country.

427
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:22,188
Not across the whole country,
maybe just Michigan.

428
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:23,628
Michel, what sports
do you play?

429
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:26,273
Well, since I'm maimed
potentially for life,

430
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:28,146
I may never play sports again.

431
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:31,359
But think back to before this tragic,
life-altering injury,

432
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:33,965
when life was still worth living.
What sports did you play then?

433
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:35,845
Well, pilates, of course.

434
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:36,488
What?

435
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,012
It's like yoga with
cables and wires.

436
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:38,963
Sounds very dangerous.

437
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:41,601
Oh, racquetball is also
a fantastic workout.

438
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:43,556
- Racquetball?
- Intriguing.

439
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:45,523
I always liked the
sound of racquetball.

440
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:47,171
Tell us more about
this racquetball.

441
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,890
Well, it's very simple --

442
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:51,690
a 4-walled room, a racquet,
and a rubber ball.

443
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:53,302
Get to the good part.
What are the clothes like?

444
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:54,538
Can we wear cute outfits?

445
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:55,179
I do.

446
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,494
I think racquetball
sounds great.

447
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,430
- Mmm, I'm in.
- Okay, good.

448
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,907
Go home. And I need to finish
up a few things around here.

449
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:01,884
I'll see you there
in about an hour.

450
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:02,804
Deal. Yeah, fun.

451
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:04,091
Okay. And no talking.

452
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:08,004
Except for smack talking because I am
so gonna kick your butt in racquetball.

453
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:11,302
No no, I mean, my balls -- they're gonna
bounce way further than your balls.

454
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:15,012
Okay, well,
you haven't seen my great top...

455
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:17,698
- flick wrist --
- We'll learn the terms.

456
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:19,310
Okay, go home and study.

457
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:27,942
- Hello?
- Miss me?

458
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,272
Logan, where are you?

459
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:30,464
Heathrow. I just landed.

460
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,267
- I miss you so much.
- I miss you, too.

461
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,617
I've been here 2 1/2 minutes,
and I can already tell it sucks.

462
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:36,582
It does suck.
I've heard that about London.

463
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:38,337
You should just get on
a plane and come home.

464
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:39,410
You gave it a chance.

465
00:18:39,427 --> 00:18:41,838
Are you on campus? I tried you at the
apartment, but I didn't get an answer.

466
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:43,544
No, I'm back at Stars Hollow.

467
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,838
That apartment suddenly
felt very big and empty.

468
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:47,293
So, what are you gonna do with
your first day of freedom?

469
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:49,289
Oh, going to play
racquetball with my mom.

470
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:50,815
This is a really
bad connection.

471
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:53,068
It sounded like you were gonna
play racquetball with your mom.

472
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,562
Hey, I could have a hidden
talent for it, you never know.

473
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:57,748
- So did you open my gift?
- Of course.

474
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,300
What did you think?

475
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:01,708
I thought... wow.

476
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:03,385
Yeah, pretty cool, right?

477
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:04,575
So cool.

478
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:06,254
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

479
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,239
Like it? I love it.

480
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:09,400
I'm so glad you got it.

481
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,107
Oh, yeah, totally.

482
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:13,485
When I left, I suddenly got worried you
wouldn't get it. But of course you got it.

483
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,893
Yeah, of course.
Of course, I got it. I loved it.

484
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:17,102
I knew you would.

485
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,242
All right, Ace, I got to go.

486
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,073
I just wanted to tell you I
touched down. I'll call later.

487
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:22,270
Okay, bye. And thank you.

488
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:23,603
Of course.

489
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,977
Like a remote-control rocket?

490
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:33,839
No, like a model rocket.

491
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,431
How big?

492
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:38,099
Is it filled with anything?
Gum or candy or anything?

493
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:38,786
Gum.

494
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,475
What? Rocket gum.
It could be a thing.

495
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:41,753
There was no gum in it.

496
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,553
It doesn't have a
button you can push?

497
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,086
No, nothing like that.
It's just a model rocket.

498
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,290
I mean, what could that mean?
Who gives someone a rocket?

499
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:50,085
I don't know. I don't know.
We'll figure it out, though.

500
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,356
Rocket, rocket, rocket.
Rocket man -- "Rocket man."

501
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:57,518
"Crocodile rock" was good. "Bennie
and the jets," "Candle in the wind."

502
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,188
Are you just naming
Elton John songs?

503
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,731
He is just so talented.

504
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:02,733
Ugh. What about space?

505
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,309
It's the final frontier?

506
00:20:04,322 --> 00:20:05,748
- Oh, no.
- What?

507
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,007
What if he was trying to say that
he wanted space away from me?

508
00:20:09,023 --> 00:20:09,936
No.

509
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:13,362
Oh, hi, we're not done racquetballing.
We've got it for like an hour.

510
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:14,379
Thanks, though.

511
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:15,921
Hey, maybe it's code.

512
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:18,589
Like I'm his rocket, right?

513
00:20:18,604 --> 00:20:20,535
Like I'm his rock, E.T.

514
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,837
I'm his rock in the
eastern time zone.

515
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:23,594
That's dumb.

516
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:25,463
Yeah, like rocket gum
is sweeping the nation.

517
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:28,187
When I have made $1 zillion

518
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:29,876
from my rocket-gum invention,

519
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,009
you will eat those words.

520
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,945
Or more likely,
chew those words

521
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,046
and blow a bubble with them,
'cause did I mention

522
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,808
that rocket gum is bubble gum?

523
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:39,129
But instead of blowing bubbles,
it releases helium

524
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,250
that shoots the
chewer up into space.

525
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:43,254
I don't think this is
helping me understand

526
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:45,106
the state of my
relationship with Logan.

527
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,909
And we're not even
supposed to be talking.

528
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:49,201
- You started it.
- I did start it.

529
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:52,001
So maybe now you would
like to talk about Luke?

530
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,994
You know what,
I'd rather racquetball.

531
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:54,840
Seriously?

532
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,078
Come on.

533
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,250
What do you think?

534
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,230
Against the wall?

535
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:01,408
- Yeah, why not.
- Okay.

536
00:21:01,422 --> 00:21:02,982
- Ready?
- Ready.

537
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:08,496
- You okay?
- Okay.

538
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,058
We're done.

539
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:13,015
See, it's starting to swell.

540
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:14,336
It is starting to swell.

541
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:16,036
Either that or the rest
of my face is shrinking.

542
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:17,530
I think we should
put something on it.

543
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:19,056
Uh, concealer and loose powder?

544
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,561
Ice, mom.
I think we should put ice on it.

545
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,853
So boring.
Neosporin and an eye patch?

546
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:25,913
Bactine, bacitracin, hydrogen peroxide.
Winnie The Pooh band-aids?

547
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:27,465
I'm getting you some ice.

548
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:30,650
Good lord.
Where'd I get all this stuff?

549
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:32,337
How can you not have ice?

550
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:33,728
You know I don't cook.

551
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,030
That is not cooking.
That is the opposite of cooking.

552
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,543
That's freezing. All you have in
here are like batteries and film

553
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,537
and something I think used
to be an ice cream sandwich.

554
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:44,759
- How old is that film?
- Ugh, 1999.

555
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,185
Bad hair year for me,
skirts were the wrong length,

556
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,467
cut me right at the calf.
I can't bring myself to develop it.

557
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:51,095
You're not putting
shaving cream on your eye.

558
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:54,665
No, just getting rid of
some of Luke's things.

559
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,372
- Steak.
- Huh?

560
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:58,185
Steak is supposed to be
good for a black eye.

561
00:21:58,198 --> 00:21:59,372
Frozen peas.

562
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:00,831
Why would I put peas in my eye?

563
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:03,727
No, like a bag of frozen peas.
It molds to the contour of your face.

564
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,302
But steak has actual
healing properties.

565
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:07,784
Something about the juices or
the fats is good for the skin.

566
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,378
I'm going to Doose's
to get you some ice.

567
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:11,227
And steak. And peas.
And ice cream!

568
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:12,484
That would feel good on my eye.

569
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,687
And then when I'm done using it,
we can eat it.

570
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,982
It's black-eye dinner.

571
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:18,536
Says the woman who
can't cook ice.

572
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,068
Oh please. I'm not gonna cook.
I'm too injured. You cook.

573
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,442
And get some bacitracin. Whatever
we use it for, we're almost out.

574
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:26,399
- Be right back.
- Thanks.

575
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:29,239
See if he has eye patches.

576
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,318
Okay, everyone, gather 'round.

577
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:33,353
Witness the miracle
of modern...

578
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,710
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

579
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:37,513
What, does this look
like a soup kitchen?

580
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,895
Well, it's a little depressing,
but no --

581
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:41,707
- Pay your bill.
- Oh, right, sorry.

582
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:44,573
- I wasn't trying to skip out or anything.
- Get lost.

583
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:54,883
There's nobody left to serve,
and I certainly don't want your company.

584
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:56,275
Thanks, Luke.

585
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:59,333
Hi, miss Patty.
Hey, Gypsy. Hi, Lulu.

586
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:00,867
- Rory!
- Hi, Rory.

587
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:03,064
Look at the college girl.
You home for the summer, chicky?

588
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:03,765
I am

589
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:04,935
You look wonderful.

590
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:07,234
If I had known that college
was so good for the complexion,

591
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:09,298
I might have cracked a book
open when I was younger.

592
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,322
Oh, thanks.

593
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:12,232
Your mom said you might
be traveling in Asia.

594
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:13,163
She's not in Asia.

595
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:14,541
I didn't know you
were going to Asia.

596
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:16,509
I was talking about it,
but that's not gonna happen.

597
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,304
Well, your mom must be
happy to have you home.

598
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:20,231
Yeah, she is.
What's going on here?

599
00:23:20,244 --> 00:23:22,389
Taylor's putting a camera
on the traffic light.

600
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:23,884
Big brother is watching.

601
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,609
Okay, everyone.
Thanks for coming.

602
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:29,053
Now, as you know,
small-town law enforcement

603
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,455
presents many challenges.

604
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:33,762
Chief among them, how to police our
streets without an actual police force.

605
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:36,219
Fortunately for the
citizens of Stars Hollow,

606
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:39,879
the fine people at Ingram Traffic
Systems have provided an answer.

607
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,607
I would now like to present

608
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:45,704
the latest and greatest weapon in
unmanned high-tech law enforcement.

609
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:47,248
Ladies and gentlemen,

610
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,235
the auto patrol P.R. 100.

611
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:55,560
How it works is very simple.

612
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:57,938
When someone drives
through the red light,

613
00:23:57,955 --> 00:24:00,769
the camera will take
three successive pictures

614
00:24:00,783 --> 00:24:03,819
of the offending party at
closer and closer range.

615
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:05,381
Seems kind of intrusive to me.

616
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:08,872
Law-abiding citizens have
nothing to worry about.

617
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:15,335
Now, we are going to have our ceremonial
first lawbreaker played by Kirk.

618
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:19,970
Kirk will drive my classic
1964 Ford Thunderbird

619
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:22,566
down the street,
through the red light,

620
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:26,022
and the auto patrol P.R.
100 will capture him

621
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:29,071
in all his law-breaking glory.

622
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:31,430
- Miss Patty?
- I'm on it.

623
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:59,010
I'm okay! I'm okay!

624
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:07,529
Okay, do you remember when
you begged me to go see

625
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,905
"The fast and the furious" with you,
and I said no?

626
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,326
And then you begged
me to go see

627
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,280
"The fast and the furious 2" with you,
and I said no?

628
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:16,829
Then "The fast and the furious 3:
Tokyo drift" came out...

629
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:18,066
They're cars, they drift.

630
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,077
And I was like,
"I said no to 1 and I said no to 2 --

631
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:23,562
"what do you think happened here,
I got a brain transplant or something?"

632
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:24,990
I remember. You were very rude.

633
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:27,820
Well, I was wrong,
because I have finally understood

634
00:25:27,836 --> 00:25:29,910
the awesomeness of cars
crashing into things,

635
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:31,455
which is a long-winded
way of saying that

636
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,765
Taylor installed this red-light
camera in front of Luke's,

637
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:36,453
and Kirk was supposed to
demonstrate how it worked,

638
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:38,735
but he got totally
blinded by the camera,

639
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:41,949
and he ended up crashing
Taylor's fancy blue T-bird --

640
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:43,349
which, by the way, who knew? --

641
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:45,159
into the side of Luke's.

642
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,667
And nobody was hurt.
Everything was fine.

643
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:48,527
But the smash-up
was unbelievable.

644
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,158
And it went right into Luke's

645
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,258
and then Kirk gets up,
he gets out of thet car,

646
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,873
and he's all like, Evel Knievel style,
like, "I'm okay, I'm okay."

647
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,033
And... um...

648
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:59,115
why is everything you own in
piles all over the floor?

649
00:25:59,128 --> 00:26:01,338
Wait a minute.
Into the diner and nobody was hurt?

650
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,874
Yeah, everything's fine.
But what is this?

651
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:04,963
There must've been a lot of damage.
Are you sure everybody's okay?

652
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:08,553
Oh, it was a mess, but everything's
fine, I swear. What is this?

653
00:26:08,564 --> 00:26:11,324
I'm just getting some of
Luke's stuff together.

654
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:13,163
- This is Luke's?
- No, this is mine.

655
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,397
But I wore it with Luke when
we went to see "Jarhead."

656
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,095
I was trying to
look kind of army,

657
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,521
and something about the combination
of the movie and the hot dogs

658
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:22,718
at the Waterbury cineplex made
me sick in the parking lot,

659
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,014
and Luke held my hair, and it was nice,
and now I got to get rid of it.

660
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:29,297
Yeah, this pile
is Luke's stuff.

661
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,308
This pile is stuff that
reminds me of Luke.

662
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:32,355
What's that pile?

663
00:26:32,368 --> 00:26:34,936
- Those are Babette's intimates.
- Of course.

664
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:37,081
So, all these books
remind you of Luke?

665
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:40,325
Yeah, those are books I gave
him to read, but he never did.

666
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,167
Cormac McCarthy -- good call.

667
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,623
"In cold blood" --
he would have loved that.

668
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:44,843
Well, he'll never know now.

669
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:47,490
You wanted him to read "Hammerhead
sharks -- demons of the deep"?

670
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:48,860
He recommended that one for me.

671
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,730
Pom-pom socks.

672
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:53,001
Al's Pancake World
takeout menus.

673
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:54,938
Hey, you're getting
rid of Bop It?

674
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:56,830
And a spatula? Why?

675
00:26:56,845 --> 00:27:00,512
Oh, oh.
'Cause Luke used to make you breakfast.

676
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:02,430
He did, but that's not
why I'm getting rid of it.

677
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:05,565
Although now that you mention it,
the waffle iron has got to be dumped.

678
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,304
We have a waffle iron?

679
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:07,820
Don't get attached.
It's got to go.

680
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,211
Spatula?

681
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:10,831
We were having an
argument in the kitchen.

682
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:13,429
And he said it was a fight, and I said
it wasn't really a fight, it was a spat.

683
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:15,529
He said there was no difference
between a fight and a spat,

684
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:17,649
and I said there was a huge
difference between a fight and a spat

685
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:19,797
because a fight cannot be
diffused in the moment,

686
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:23,815
but a spat can easily be diffused
with the use of a spatula.

687
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:27,261
And I took the spatula out of the drawer,
and I whacked him with it a little bit,

688
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:30,464
and he started laughing,
and I started laughing, and...

689
00:27:30,477 --> 00:27:32,101
now I got to get rid of it.

690
00:27:32,203 --> 00:27:34,108
- Sad.
- I know.

691
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,852
Okay, what happened
between you two?

692
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:37,626
You have got to give
me something here,

693
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,237
because you cannot just say that
you don't want to talk about it,

694
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,305
because I saw Lukes today,
and I waved at him,

695
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:43,504
and I did not know how to act.

696
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,154
I mean, was it an "I hate you" wave,
or an "I'm sorry" wave,

697
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,003
or "I can't believe you wanted
my mother to shave her head

698
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:49,261
and become a moonie" wave.

699
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:50,476
He doesn't want me
to shave my head.

700
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:51,553
You shouldn't hate him.

701
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:53,528
There's nothing to
be angry about.

702
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,416
You knew we were having
problems, right?

703
00:27:55,431 --> 00:27:57,488
The whole April thing and
postponing the wedding.

704
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,723
Finally, I got tired
of waiting for him,

705
00:27:59,738 --> 00:28:01,496
so I gave him an ultimatum.

706
00:28:01,511 --> 00:28:03,797
And he said no. So, that's it.

707
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:06,703
It's over.
Here I am, making piles.

708
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,620
The third stage of
grief is making piles.

709
00:28:12,213 --> 00:28:13,726
Steak or peas?

710
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:15,086
No, no, no --
this is not my fault!

711
00:28:15,102 --> 00:28:16,661
This is all your fault,
Taylor, all of it!

712
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,319
Lucas, I understand
why you're perturbed.

713
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:19,756
Perturbed? Do I seem perturbed?

714
00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:22,671
I am so far past perturbed
that I couldn't look behind me

715
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:24,112
and see perturbed
with a telescope.

716
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,914
You never listen to
anybody, Taylor.

717
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:28,601
You just barrel along and decide
what's best for everybody,

718
00:28:28,614 --> 00:28:29,720
consequences be damned.

719
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:33,125
Now, I grant you the ceremony today
did not go entirely according to plan.

720
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:35,429
According to plan?
There's a car in my diner --

721
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:37,174
a freaking car, Taylor.

722
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:40,893
A two-door 1965 Ford
Thunderbird in my diner.

723
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:41,997
Actually, it's a '64.

724
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,770
So, you do you think?
You want me to move it out or not?

725
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,295
I would really advise waiting
until our insurance agents arrived.

726
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:47,875
It's up to you, pal.
It's on your property.

727
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:49,572
- I don't know yet!
- You could have some sympathy.

728
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:52,557
After all, it's my car that crashed,
my most prized possession.

729
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:54,648
I mean, the paint job alone
is gonna cost me a fortune,

730
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:56,249
and who knows what other
damage has been done

731
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:57,823
or what my insurance
will or won't cover?

732
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,431
Well, maybe I'll come
back with a sledgehammer,

733
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:00,919
and you can tell them
you totaled the thing.

734
00:29:00,953 --> 00:29:03,718
Luke, I would strongly advise
against any rash action

735
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:06,338
that could lead to undue
and costly litigation.

736
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:08,131
- How about now?
- Giant red spots.

737
00:29:08,144 --> 00:29:09,591
Nothing but giant red spots.

738
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:10,864
How's it look
under there, Gypsy?

739
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,427
Well, the car is fine.

740
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:14,950
It definitely wasn't faulty
brakes that caused the accident.

741
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:15,880
Kirk is just an idiot.

742
00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:17,817
Hey, I resent that.
Who was that?

743
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:19,055
Damn giant red spots.

744
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:20,081
What do you want
to do here, buddy?

745
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:22,066
You want me to pull the car out or
you wanna wait for the insurance guy?

746
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,669
I'm not sure what
I want to do yet.

747
00:29:23,684 --> 00:29:25,817
I need to know now.
I can't spend all day here.

748
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:28,395
Either we move the car right now,
or I take off, you leave it in here,

749
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:30,651
and wait for the insurance guys.
You got to decide.

750
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:33,403
Look, do not pressure me, okay?
I do not like being pressured.

751
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,187
It's not one or the other.
I need to think.

752
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:38,074
Will you people just give
me some time to think?

753
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:42,417
- Soothing.
- Very.

754
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:44,776
- Zen.
- Thoreau, Walden Pond.

755
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:47,172
- Oh, I have an idea.
- Huh?

756
00:29:48,357 --> 00:29:50,599
Maybe I should just go to Ikea.

757
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,974
- I like it.
- Yeah?

758
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,977
Maybe you can use it as the
basis for your redecorating.

759
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:02,576
Use it as a jumping-off point.
Make everything kind of gray and shiny.

760
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:04,302
Well, it doesn't remind
me of Luke at all.

761
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:06,930
Well, that's my problem.
It doesn't remind me of Logan either.

762
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:08,128
It's so frustrating.

763
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:09,470
Why don't you just call him?

764
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:12,281
I can't do that until I know what
this is, until I know what it means.

765
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:14,131
See, this long distance
thing isn't working already.

766
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,342
Rory, he just left.

767
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:18,074
Exactly, and I'm already
completely confused.

768
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:19,550
I mean,
I think we're still together,

769
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:21,842
but that's what I thought last
time we spent time apart.

770
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:24,156
I was 100% sure that we
were still together,

771
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:26,704
and he was 100% sure
that we had broken up,

772
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,661
and then he ended up sleeping
with those bridesmaids.

773
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:30,351
What is it you guys agreed to?

774
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:31,943
Well, that's just it.
Nothing, really.

775
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,267
I mean,
it was early in the morning,

776
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,403
and we hadn't had a chance
to decide on anything,

777
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,065
and we hadn't had the talk.

778
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:38,405
Now it's too late.

779
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,863
He's thousands of miles away,

780
00:30:39,877 --> 00:30:42,626
and we talk on the phone,
but we don't really say anything.

781
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,160
And he's leaving me rockets.

782
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:46,980
Well, it's not too late.
He's been gone a day -- less than a day.

783
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:48,006
You guys will figure it out.

784
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,970
But it's hard on the phone, you know.
I can't see him.

785
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,409
I can't read his expression.

786
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:53,980
How am I ever supposed to know
what he's thinking or feeling?

787
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:55,688
I mean,
his eyes always give him away.

788
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:57,394
Logan has very expressive eyes.

789
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:58,458
I've noticed.

790
00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:00,300
It's one of the things he and
Bette Davis have in common.

791
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:03,293
And sometimes he'll smile at me,
and I can tell exactly how he's feeling,

792
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:04,685
and now I can't.

793
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:05,977
So go to London.

794
00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:07,493
- What?
- Go to London.

795
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:08,912
Go be with him this summer.

796
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:11,571
The two of you were supposed to go
traveling in Asia together anyway.

797
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,381
You don't have any plans for the summer,
so go.

798
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:15,377
I can't just go to London.

799
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:17,533
- Can I?
- Why not?

800
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:19,750
You two could have an amazing
summer together in London.

801
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:21,295
Pick up the phone. Call him.

802
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:23,317
I need to do some
more googling.

803
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,949
I'm going to bed.

804
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:29,917
- So Taylor's car is...
- In Luke's diner.

805
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:23,737
- Hello.
- Hey, how you doing?

806
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:24,821
Fine.

807
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:26,702
I'm just checking in.

808
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:29,531
Had a really great
time last night.

809
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:34,304
Don't worry.
This is not a booty call.

810
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:38,055
It can't be, 'cause you're not 18,
and it's not 1997.

811
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,544
Are you doing anything
tomorrow night?

812
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:41,336
'Cause I was thinking
maybe you could come over,

813
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:43,351
and I could cook us some diner.

814
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:44,605
Christopher.

815
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,190
Lorelai.

816
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:50,525
Let's not make more
out of it than it was.

817
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:52,239
So, you're saying last
night was a booty call.

818
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:54,741
I'm just saying,
I don't think it should happen again.

819
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:56,096
Oh.

820
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,168
Okay.

821
00:32:59,668 --> 00:33:01,821
Well, I'm here for you
if you need anything.

822
00:33:01,835 --> 00:33:02,981
You know that, right?

823
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,560
I -- yeah, no --
I appreciate... that.

824
00:33:05,577 --> 00:33:07,871
Okay. I guess I'll
say good night.

825
00:33:07,888 --> 00:33:09,599
Yeah -- night.

826
00:33:10,246 --> 00:33:11,219
Okay.

827
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,489
I got it, I got it.
He loved her so much

828
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:22,509
he was willing to wait 40
years alone in space for her.

829
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,970
I got it. The rocket, I get it.

830
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:27,095
You do?

831
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,491
Yes. I have been googling rockets,
you know.

832
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,454
Rocket ships, rocket love,
rocket London, Logan rocket,

833
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,849
and let me tell you, it has not always
been a pleasant journey. People are freaks.

834
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:38,086
But then I found this blog,
rocket boy.

835
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,435
- Rocket boy.
- Rocket boy.

836
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:41,047
Knows a ton about rockets.
And as it turns out,

837
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,406
he's got over 200
classic L.E.V.s.

838
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:45,662
- L.E.V.s?
- Lunar Excursion Vehicles.

839
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:47,734
So then he tells me that
he hosts this chat-room,

840
00:33:47,745 --> 00:33:49,987
and this is where
I get really lucky,

841
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:52,834
because rocketchamp465
was just logging off,

842
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:55,108
and I caught him,
and I described the rocket to him,

843
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,167
and he recognized it from one of
these episodes of "The Twilight Zone."

844
00:33:58,181 --> 00:33:59,222
"The Twilight Zone."

845
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:00,977
So I clicked on "The
Twilight Zone" website,

846
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:03,385
and I found the episode,
and I got it!

847
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:05,772
I still have no idea what
you're talking about.

848
00:34:05,787 --> 00:34:07,747
When Logan and I were
first going out,

849
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,657
we were in the pool house
one night really late,

850
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:10,874
and we were falling
asleep on the couch.

851
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:11,774
Wa wa wa.

852
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,945
- Mom.
- Sorry.

853
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,692
- Chachi, right?
- Proud.

854
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:17,164
- So, we were on the couch.
- Wa wa wa.

855
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,976
And this episode of "The Twilight
Zone" came on -- "The Long Morrow."

856
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,926
That's a bad title.

857
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:22,459
- That's not the point.
- I'm just saying.

858
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:26,084
So, there's this astronaut who was
supposed to go into space for 40 years,

859
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,472
but right before he left,
he met this beautiful woman.

860
00:34:28,488 --> 00:34:30,526
But for those 40 years that
he was going to be in space,

861
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:32,654
he was going to be in
suspended animation.

862
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:34,267
So when he came back to earth,

863
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,674
he was going to
be really young,

864
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:37,440
but she would be really old.

865
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:40,422
So he goes into space,
and when he does come back,

866
00:34:40,437 --> 00:34:42,322
the woman is still
young and beautiful

867
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:45,802
because she put herself in
suspended animation to wait for him,

868
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,279
but he's really, really old

869
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,726
because he took himself
out of suspended animation

870
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:51,261
so he could be old with her.

871
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:52,276
How depressing.

872
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:55,210
He spent 40 years alone in
space just waiting to see her,

873
00:34:55,224 --> 00:34:57,570
and he was willing to come
back as an 80-year-old man,

874
00:34:57,585 --> 00:34:59,507
giving up almost
his entire life

875
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:01,568
just to spend those last
few years with her.

876
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,746
Now, are you aware when you're
in suspended animation,

877
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:05,262
or is it just like
a really long nap?

878
00:35:05,276 --> 00:35:09,404
Shush! The point is, that this is Logan's
favorite episode of "The Twilight Zone."

879
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:11,263
And when we watched
it together,

880
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:13,911
he said, "that's true love."

881
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:15,543
That's true love!

882
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:18,123
This is the most romantic
gift I've ever been given.

883
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:20,489
I mean, I have to call him.
I'm going to London.

884
00:35:20,507 --> 00:35:21,709
I am going to London.

885
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:22,755
Yay!

886
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:24,892
But -- wait,
are you gonna be okay while I'm gone?

887
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:27,127
Yes, I'll be fine.

888
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:29,938
Okay, but we're going shopping
for linens before I go.

889
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:33,772
- Hello?
- Hey!

890
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:34,628
Hey!

891
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:36,603
I'm sorry for calling so early.
Did I wake you?

892
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:38,282
I'm actually at the office.

893
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:39,162
On a dare?

894
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,273
It's my first day, so I'm trying
to make a good impression.

895
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,228
So you're, like,
dressed and everything?

896
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:45,300
New suit, new shoes,
even brushed my hair.

897
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:47,430
How's the office? Is it fabulous?
Do you have a window?

898
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,300
I wouldn't say it's fabulous,
but I do have a window.

899
00:35:49,332 --> 00:35:50,519
Can you see the queen?

900
00:35:50,534 --> 00:35:52,407
Actually, my window looks
out on Piccadilly Circus.

901
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,963
So, you can just see
elephants and clowns

902
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:55,619
walking past your
building all day long?

903
00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:57,165
- That must be nice.
- It's brilliant.

904
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:59,245
Brilliant? Oh, my god.
You're turning british.

905
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,665
Do you have a secretary
named Moneypenny?

906
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:02,362
My secretary's name is Steven.

907
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:04,877
- Steven Moneypenny?
- Yes.

908
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:08,769
So... I just wanted to
thank you for the rocket.

909
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,007
You already thanked me.

910
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:12,184
Oh, I know, I did,
but I wanted to do it again,

911
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:15,874
because I'm not sure I conveyed how much
I loved it in our last conversation.

912
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,311
I really, really loved it.

913
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:19,566
I'm glad.

914
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:22,136
I can't wait to come see you, Logan.
I can't wait.

915
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:23,978
- I already got you a ticket.
- You're kidding.

916
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:26,721
I got it right here. I was gonna fedex
it to you. You'll have it by tomorrow.

917
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:27,788
Oh, my god!

918
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:30,499
Yeah, so tell your mom you're
not gonna be home for Christmas.

919
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,681
Christmas?

920
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:32,926
Two weeks, just you and me.

921
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,403
I already cleared it with my dad.
It's gonna be amazing.

922
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:36,293
I'm still playing around with the
itinerary, but how do you feel about

923
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,914
- London, Paris, and Rome?
- Wow.

924
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:40,256
I figured we'd do a week in London,
then quick train ride,

925
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,087
and we do three days in Paris,
and we finish our trip

926
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,609
with a four-day
sojourn in Rome.

927
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:45,136
We still have enough time
for one last night in London

928
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:46,152
before you have
to fly back home.

929
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:48,627
Logan, that sounds amazing.

930
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:50,229
Oh, hey, I should take off.

931
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,752
My first staff meeting.
They're waving me in.

932
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:53,145
Oh, okay, good luck.

933
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:55,369
- Thanks, cheers.
- Cheers.

934
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:22,778
Uh... a car crashed into
my diner yesterday.

935
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:25,079
There's a giant hole
where my wall used to be.

936
00:37:25,095 --> 00:37:28,265
It's gonna take a
couple of weeks to fix.

937
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:32,157
It's a disaster,
but I don't care.

938
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:34,240
I mean, I care, but...

939
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:37,854
You know what, no. I really --

940
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,454
I don't care.

941
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:42,504
It's like it's not
even real to me.

942
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:46,169
It's like my life
isn't even real to me

943
00:37:46,185 --> 00:37:48,721
unless you're there,
and you're in it,

944
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:50,705
and I'm sharing it with you.

945
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:53,169
And, uh,
I don't know what I was waiting for,

946
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,089
and I don't know what I was scared of,
but I'm not.

947
00:37:55,121 --> 00:37:57,868
I'm not scared, and I'm not waiting.
I'm here.

948
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:00,008
- Luke.
- No, don't say anything.

949
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:03,729
I've got a tank full of gas,
and Maryland is only 200 miles away,

950
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:06,605
and I've made us some reservations
at a couple of bed-and-breakfasts.

951
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:09,444
If you don't want to do the
Maryland thing, we don't have to.

952
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,227
I heard you say
"Maryland" the other day.

953
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:14,069
I don't know whether you were serious.
I'm just trying to cover my bases here.

954
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:15,918
- Luke --
- I also packed some camping equipment

955
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:19,256
so we can head to Vermont or Maine and,
you know,

956
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:23,026
check into a cabin for a week,
you know, like a little honeymoon thing.

957
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,841
But maybe that's a little
too rustic for your taste.

958
00:38:26,855 --> 00:38:29,825
Or we could drive
to Atlantic City

959
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:32,921
or even Las Vegas if you want to
make a real road trip out of it.

960
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,179
Luke, stop.

961
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:37,380
I also did some research,
and we can also apparently

962
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:39,435
use a sea captain, if you want.

963
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:41,910
I'm not sure how big the boat
has to be for it to be legal,

964
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:44,777
but we can head to the coast,
and we can knock on some doors,

965
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:46,858
you know, boat doors.

966
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:49,515
Yeah, that's probably not
the most sensible way.

967
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,691
- Just stop.
- But, no, you were right.

968
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:54,778
Okay. I need to be faster. I need to
move faster, I need to think faster.

969
00:38:54,794 --> 00:38:57,454
And, well, here I am.

970
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:00,513
It's over.

971
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,308
No, you can't say that.

972
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:04,724
You can't just say that it's over.
It's not over.

973
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:07,804
You can't just decide that it's over.
I'm in this, too, you know.

974
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:11,168
I'm not gonna let it be over.
You said, "be ready now or never."

975
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:12,146
I'm ready now.

976
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,365
- Luke.
- Let's go.

977
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:15,780
Let's do this.
Let's get married right now.

978
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:17,268
Let's go.

979
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:20,134
I slept with Christopher.
