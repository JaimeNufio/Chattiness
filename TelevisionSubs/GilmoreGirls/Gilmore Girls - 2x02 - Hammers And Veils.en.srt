1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,505
- Rory?
- Living room.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,673
I need your advice on something.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,012
What do you think? Not good?

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,806
I'm not sure. Have you tried
the arts-and-leisure section?

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,809
- I need you to be serious.
- You've got a newspaper on your head.

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,770
- I know.
- And you need me to be serious?

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,607
- I am trying to figure out veil lengths here.
- Sure.

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:28,153
See, I kind of like this shoulder-length,
semi-poofy thing like this.

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,697
But there's also a longer one
that may be interesting.

10
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,865
Longer. Sure.

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,201
- And then there's the full-on Diana.
- Right.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,787
Which is nice,
but it just might be a little...

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,830
- You're reading me.
- Wait, don't move.

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,040
Rory, stop it.

15
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,251
This arms race thing
is really getting crazy.

16
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:46,296
We're having a serious conversation about
my life's most important fashion decision.

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,007
Why not go to a wedding dress place
and try a real veil on?

18
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,509
- No way.
- Why?

19
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,011
Too much taffeta.
Gives me cotillion flashbacks.

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,932
Fine. Could you bend over so I can see
what the weather will be like tomorrow?

21
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,394
Actually, I went in
one of those places yesterday.

22
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,813
- You did? Which one?
- Marry Meme's.

23
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,108
- I see we're going top of the line.
- It was horrible!

24
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,361
You need to order your wedding dress
the first day of junior high.

25
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,947
And if you haven't,
it's off the rack for you, missy.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,658
I tried on three dresses,
one of which gave me a rash.

27
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,203
- Has anyone missed the bustle? I haven't.
- It was not that bad.

28
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,707
They all looked wrong.
I'll be gross, and all the children will laugh.

29
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,959
Max will realize
he's made a horrible mistake.

30
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,879
And then people will walk away,
exactly as you're doing now.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,422
- Let's go.
- Where?

32
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,882
Wedding dress shopping.

33
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,633
- You're reading.
- I'm done.

34
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,052
- You need to see Dean.
- He's playing softball.

35
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,888
Your cure for cancer's almost finished.

36
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,391
We'll find the perfect thing for you
to wear on your perfect wedding day.

37
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,727
There will be no pointing, mocking,
or walking out.

38
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,270
Why did you say 'pointing'?

39
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,897
- Keys.
- Thank You.

40
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,540
Spending the summer at Chilton.
Happy, happy, joy, joy.

41
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,501
If I don't improve my French grades,
I can kiss Vassar goodbye.

42
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,171
You need to follow a study schedule.
I've told you this since second grade.

43
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,923
Which worries both of us.

44
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,300
- Maybe I won't go to college.
- You have to go.

45
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,470
- Princess Grace didn't go.
- Thank you for the history lesson.

46
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,347
- Take a pill.
- Marry rich.

47
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,974
Hey.

48
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,561
- You doing the summer school thing, too?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,438
- What classes are you taking?
- Well, I...

50
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,276
- What?
- You're not talking to me.

51
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,777
I'm not?

52
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,487
- Tristin?
- PJ Harvey?

53
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,449
I'll look at the board, then you can
get back to your conversation.

54
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,035
There's a Rebuilding Together thing
going on tomorrow.

55
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,871
They fix up homes for the needy.

56
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,708
It's a total easy gig
that looks great on your college transcript.

57
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,336
- Sorry.
- Thanks, I'll think about it.

58
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,505
- You wouldn't like it.
- 'Cause you'll be there?

59
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,091
- Yes, I'll be there.
- I'll think about it.

60
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,303
- You don't want to go.
- I'll see.

61
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,888
You don't. It's not you.

62
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,557
I have multiple personalities.
It might be one of me.

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,895
It's hours of hammering, drilling, and dirt.
It's horrible, you'll hate it.

64
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:52,691
How do you know that I don't spend hours
every week hammering and drilling?

65
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,568
And dirt? I love dirt. I collect it.

66
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,361
- You're hilarious.
- You're pathetic.

67
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,030
Fine. Forget it.

68
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,285
- Why don't you want me to go?
- I don't care if you go.

69
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,163
You just spent a lot of energy
trying to convince me not to.

70
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,540
- I'm late for class.
- Are you going to be mad...

71
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,336
because you thought I was dating Tristin,
even though I wasn't, all your life?

72
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,880
- I have commitments.
- You don't see how stupid that is?

73
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:19,176
Sorry if you thought we had a deep
Thelma-and-Louise thing, but we didn't.

74
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,055
- Have it your way but I'm going tomorrow.
- Fine, go. See if I care.

75
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,682
- I will.
- Great. I hate summer!

76
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,070
- Henry. Hi, nice to see you.
- You, too. What classes are you taking?

77
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,697
Shakespeare, Physics,
Obscure Russian Poetry.

78
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,117
Wow. I'm still trying to get through Trig.,
but third time's the charm.

79
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,621
- I can help you if you want.
- I just may take you up on that.

80
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,584
- Lane's fine.
- Good. I haven't talked to her in a while.

81
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,045
- I called once.
- And?

82
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,881
Her mother answered. She sounded angry.

83
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,385
- No, that's just Mrs. Kim.
- I hung up, 12 times.

84
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,763
On the 13th time,
she said she'd have the FBI trace the call...

85
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,056
and have me thrown in prison.

86
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,476
And though I know the punishment
for multiple hang-ups isn't prison...

87
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,145
she sounded so capable
of doing real damage that I...

88
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,438
Stopped calling?

89
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:17,276
- Lane probably thinks I forgot about her.
- You want me to tell her you haven't?

90
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,777
- That would be good.
- Done.

91
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,446
Maybe you could give her my number
and she can call me.

92
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,782
- I'll get right on it.
- Thanks.

93
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,414
- Thank you. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

94
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,751
- What?
- Your trig. Notes.

95
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,216
I think we may have
nailed down the problem.

96
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,307
- 'Tomorrow I'm going to build a house. '
- Help build a house.

97
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,934
Did you tell them
there's a light bulb in your closet...

98
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,228
that burned out in '97
you still haven't changed?

99
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,771
It's for charity.

100
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,610
Don't those people have enough problems
without having you as a contractor?

101
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,821
I'm sure there will be
real construction workers there.

102
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,325
I will be assisting and helping out
those less fortunate than myself.

103
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,995
I will be getting college credit,
and this is the end of this conversation.

104
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,540
You're right, it's a good thing. Nice.
Keeps your halo shiny.

105
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,875
Wait.

106
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,503
When are you going to tell them?

107
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,087
- Soon.
- When is soon?

108
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,840
When the big hand hits the'S'
and the little hand 'oon. '

109
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,510
You're getting married in three months.
Tell them now.

110
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,262
- Ring the bell.
- The longer you wait, the harder it'll be.

111
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,140
- Will you please ring the bell?
- Tell them before dinner.

112
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,767
I will tell them when I'm ready.

113
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,102
You have to accept that
because I'm the mother.

114
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,855
In some cultures,
that means you have to do what I say.

115
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,442
- If you don't tell them in two weeks, I will.
- Apparently not in this one.

116
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,610
Good.

117
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,241
We'll have to eat quickly. Your father
has an early flight tomorrow morning.

118
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,534
Oh, I'm good.

119
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,371
Rory's going to build a house tomorrow.
I thought it was a little weird, too.

120
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,498
Walk as you babble, please.

121
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,626
Somebody must have scratched the silver.

122
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,339
Bring the bread out, too.
And pour the wine, please.

123
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,841
Come on, hurry up.

124
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,552
Yeah, because we don't want our salad
to get cold.

125
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,220
Richard, dinner.

126
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,180
- Mom.
- Eat.

127
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,225
- Shouldn't we wait for Dad?
- Don't worry about him.

128
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,395
He's the one with the early plane.
We don't have to go anywhere.

129
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,730
We can stay all night, have a party...

130
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,609
do some Jell-O shots,
play Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board.

131
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,653
Pass the bread.

132
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,072
- Grandma, would you like...
- Yes, please.

133
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,200
- You started.
- You have a 6:00 flight.

134
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,872
- 6:00? Are you sure?
- What do you mean? Of course I'm sure.

135
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,417
I checked it thrice with your secretary,
because I know she's an idiot...

136
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,794
and all three times she told me 6:00.

137
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:44,131
I wrote it down.
I have your ticket right out on the...

138
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,258
- You're teasing me.
- Very possible.

139
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,679
- I don't find that amusing, Richard.
- Exactly the point of teasing, Emily.

140
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,848
- Hello, Lorelai.
- Hello, Father.

141
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,850
- Rory.
- Grandpa.

142
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,520
May I speak with you
for a moment, please?

143
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:00,939
Okay.

144
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,446
I wonder what that's all about.

145
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,826
I guess we'll find out later, right?

146
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,123
Hey, whatever happened to Xuxa?

147
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,379
I thought we should touch base, you and I,
after that unfortunate incident last week.

148
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,215
You already called me about that.

149
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:31,011
I know, but I thought taking a moment
to once again say to you in person how...

150
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,264
I know, and I appreciate it.

151
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,017
- We've never had a fight.
- No.

152
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,019
- This was our first one.
- Yes, it was.

153
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:43,106
- And I must say, I didn't care for it.
- Neither did I.

154
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,778
All right. We should go back inside.

155
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,075
- We're fine now, right?
- We're fine.

156
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,747
Buck up, Private.

157
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,459
Wait. I wanted to give you something.

158
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,503
- What?
- Come on.

159
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,215
- Where are you guys going?
- We'll be right there.

160
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,760
Well, hurry, you're missing
one hell of a conversation.

161
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,348
- I'm really loving this salad dressing.
- I'm glad.

162
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,016
- Lemony.
- Yes.

163
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,563
Nothing like a nice salad
of lemony goodness.

164
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,157
Mom.

165
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,828
- I have something to tell you.
- Yes?

166
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,374
Well, it's like this.

167
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,628
Could you put down your fork
for a second?

168
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,673
Thank you.

169
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,969
- Okay. You know Max?
- No, I don't.

170
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,764
I know you don't know-him know him,
but you know of him, right?

171
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,641
I've heard rumblings.

172
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,442
Max and I have been serious
for quite a while now.

173
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,321
He asked me to marry him and I said yes.
I'm getting married.

174
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,118
Well, I think that's very nice.

175
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:22,206
I certainly hope we'll be in town for it,
but if not, we'll send a nice gift.

176
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,334
Now excuse me.
I'm going to check on the roast.

177
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,466
- Are you okay?
- I'm perfect.

178
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,927
- Really?
- I have hit a level of perfection...

179
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,804
that's rarely seen
outside the Victoria's Secret catalog.

180
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,181
I'm really sorry.

181
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,309
Do not be sorry.
What happened tonight was inevitable.

182
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,771
- I should have known not to tell Mom.
- You were trying to be nice.

183
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,774
Telling her I was getting married
to a wonderful guy...

184
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,692
who will love me and make me happy.

185
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,237
That, and giving her my address
when I moved out.

186
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,655
Two worst moves I made.

187
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,824
Maybe she'll think about it
and call you and say she's sorry.

188
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:02,037
'Mom, I'm getting married. 'I'm an idiot.
And as my mouth was opening...

189
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,250
my mind was screaming,
'Don't do it. I mean it. You'll regret it. '

190
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,502
- But did my mouth listen?
- No.

191
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,130
And it opened, and the words came out,
and Emily was Emily...

192
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,634
and my mouth was stunned,
and my mind said, 'I told you so. '

193
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:19,263
Then my mouth got mad 'cause no mouth
likes to have its nose rubbed in it.

194
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,976
Now my mind and mouth aren't talking.
It'll take weeks to get them together.

195
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,936
Your mouth has a nose?

196
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,482
- God, I'm crabby.
- You're hungry.

197
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,901
- No, I'm not.
- You didn't eat any of your dinner.

198
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:36,697
By the time I got my jaw off the ground,
Speed Racer had taken my plate.

199
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,574
Luke will cheer you up, won't you?

200
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,827
Sure, I'm great at spreading the joy.
What will you have?

201
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,663
We'll have two coffees and a rant meal.
Extra cheese.

202
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,789
- No.
- Why?

203
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:49,626
I'm through ranting. I'll have
an acceptance meal and a side of fries.

204
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,420
Please, you have not accepted this.

205
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,923
I'm a grown woman. I do not need
my mother's blessing to be happy.

206
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,635
- Must have been a good Oprah today.
- Just a little family drama. No biggie.

207
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,846
- It's a little big.
- What's going on?

208
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:05,184
I told my mother about me
getting married and it was slightly ugly.

209
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,894
- Yep.
- Yep what?

210
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,479
There's nothing like a wedding
to screw up a family.

211
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,107
There's nothing like a family
to screw up a family.

212
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,652
Something that's supposed to start nice.
Two people promising each other:

213
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,905
'I love you forever.
I want to die when you die.

214
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,699
'My life meant nothing
until you used my toothbrush. '

215
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,910
- And then it starts.
- That's not exactly...

216
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,121
Who do you invite?
Who sits where? Open bar? Yes or no?

217
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,166
Auntie Juny doesn't eat chicken.
Uncle Momo's off his meds.

218
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,335
- Juny and Momo?
- Just an example.

219
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,878
Of a retired circus couple?

220
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,006
After all that planning,
the reception will still be a disaster.

221
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,175
No matter how carefully you plan...

222
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,719
halfway through one of those
Bette Midler ballads...

223
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:45,140
someone's drunk, or with someone's wife,
and a chicken Kiev lands on the cake.

224
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:49,102
The Gettysburg Address was only
one page long, and that was about a war.

225
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,813
- I call them like I see them.
- I've changed my order.

226
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,399
I'll have the Luke's-giving-Lorelai-
a- migraine meal.

227
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,026
- Blue cheese or ranch?
- Both.

228
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,694
Coming right up.

229
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,783
- Time?
- 8:30.

230
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,035
- I'm late.
- Hold on. Coffee.

231
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,788
- Thanks. I'll see you tonight.
- Wait. One sec.

232
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,665
I have to be there in 20 minutes.

233
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,626
- I made you something really cool.
- Can it wait till tonight?

234
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,086
It won't be cool tonight.

235
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,714
What do you mean?
What loses its cool factor in 12 hours?

236
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,592
- This.
- What is that?

237
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,470
- A hammer.
- It has feathers on it. Why?

238
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,556
So the rhinestones and bows
won't feel lonely.

239
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,850
- What do I do with it?
- Build a pretty house.

240
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,185
How long will it take
to talk you out of giving it?

241
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,312
- Forty minutes, an hour tops.
- Hand it over.

242
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,773
- Call me when you get home. Be careful.
- I will.

243
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,401
I mean it, Timmy.
No falling down the well.

244
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,156
- You scared me.
- Sorry. Where you going?

245
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,910
- I'm doing that Rebuilding Together thing.
- Right. I'll be fast.

246
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:50,289
Here's my CDs, my posters, my books...

247
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,500
three of my sweaters,
and one Viva Glam lipstick.

248
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:57,087
I'll leave them here while I'm in Korea
because Mom will search my room.

249
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,299
If she finds them, she'll throw them out
and spend the summer...

250
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,801
- praying for my soul.
- I'll treat them like my own.

251
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:06,388
Okay. Now, this is
the Lane Kim retrieval kit.

252
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,100
It contains the phone number
of my cousins in Korea...

253
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,729
a map of the house I'll be staying at,
a picture of me now...

254
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,732
- and a mock-up of me in six months.
- You lost some weight.

255
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,860
This is that name of that guy
at the American consulate...

256
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,696
and several Korean phrases
written out phonetically:

257
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,991
'Help,' 'Have you seen this girl?'
'Comes for money,' et cetera.

258
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:30,496
- Still no return date info from the parents?
- Nope. But they did buy me a winter coat.

259
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,082
- When are you going?
- Right after your mom's engagement...

260
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,503
- Do you think she heard me?
- I don't think so.

261
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,796
She'd be here grilling us for details
if she had.

262
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,090
She wouldn't pretend,
to not kill the surprise?

263
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,884
And risk clashing with the decor?

264
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,470
- Right. Okay, I got to go.
- Hey, Henry...

265
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,347
- Called him.
- And?

266
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,058
He likes me. He's perfect.
I'll never see him again.

267
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:55,187
You'll read about it in my novel:
A Connecticut Yankee in Pusan.

268
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,862
- Hey.
- Hi.

269
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,406
- Where you going?
- I have to build a house.

270
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,201
- Okay, so where you going?
- I'm serious.

271
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,830
- You're going to build a house?
- It's for charity, and I'm late.

272
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:13,997
Why don't you go in?

273
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,792
You and Mom can continue
the Rory's-building-a-house routine.

274
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,544
Then move on to 'Who's on First?'

275
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,547
- How long are you going to be gone?
- I don't know. Why?

276
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,551
I just thought we could hang today,
see a movie, get something to eat.

277
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,595
We could go to a bookstore,
I'll watch you browse for some hours.

278
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,848
I would love to, but I have to do this.

279
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,391
- Blow it off.
- I can't.

280
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,393
Did I mention the bookstore
for some hours?

281
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,312
How about tonight?
We can get a pizza and go on Amazon.

282
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,774
You'll be just as bored
watching me order books, I promise.

283
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,860
- Deal.
- Good. I have to go.

284
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,040
Excuse me.

285
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,919
You're touching a man with a saw.
What are you thinking?

286
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,213
- I'm sorry.
- I could have hurt myself.

287
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:06,300
I could have hurt you.
A ton of hurt almost happened here.

288
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,887
I really am sorry.
I've never been on a job site before.

289
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,806
- It's nice.
- Okay, where you from?

290
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,766
- Chilton. My name...
- Come on, Chilton.

291
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,395
- No, it's Rory. Chilton's my school.
- You got a hammer?

292
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,898
- Yes, sir.
- Where is it?

293
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,115
- It's a real hammer underneath.
- That's a hammer?

294
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,244
- It's just dressed up a little.
- You dressed up a hammer?

295
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:37,581
No, my mother did. She does that.

296
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:41,001
She takes things that aren't pretty,
and makes them pretty...

297
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,503
like a hammer.

298
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,881
One time, she made individual outfits
for my Liquid Paper bottles:

299
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,800
A clown, a cowboy, a newscaster.

300
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,596
- She's not insane. She just sounds it.
- Okay.

301
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,681
Work here. Wear these.

302
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,227
Don't look up.
Pay attention to your surroundings.

303
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,230
The words 'duck' or 'run'
mean duck or run.

304
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:04,650
Wear sunscreen, drink water,
get a button on the way out.

305
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,486
That's it? That's the instructions?

306
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:11,114
- But I've never done this before.
- Tomorrow you won't be able to say that.

307
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:15,702
But people have to live in these houses.
They may have kids, pets, or breakables.

308
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,704
You have trouble,
ask the person next to you.

309
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,039
Look out!

310
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:23,794
Hey, you learn fast.
I didn't even mention that one.

311
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:43,730
This is my wall.

312
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,649
- What?
- I've been working here.

313
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,776
I put together this wall.
Go someplace else.

314
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,445
- You put together this wall?
- Go help with cement.

315
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:53,991
- That's very impressive.
- I've done it lots of times. No big deal.

316
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,244
Louise, what did I just tell you?
Use a grub ax for that.

317
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,537
Bite me.

318
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,248
I never pictured you
as a Bob Vila kind of girl.

319
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,793
Rebuilding Together is a prestigious
and respected organization.

320
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:08,714
- I've been volunteering for them for years.
- Really? You just love the overalls?

321
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,758
- I don't. Harvard does.
- What does that mean?

322
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:15,262
When you apply to an Ivy League school,
you need more than good grades...

323
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,847
and test scores to get you in.

324
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:20,601
Everyone who applies to Harvard
has a perfect GPA and great test scores.

325
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:25,189
It's the extras that put you over the top:
The clubs, charities, volunteering.

326
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:29,193
- Oh, yeah. I know.
- I started volunteering in fourth grade.

327
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,737
I handed out cookies
at the local children's hospital.

328
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,533
By 10, I was leading my first study group.
The youngest person in the group was 12.

329
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,786
I've been a camp counselor,
organized a senior literacy program...

330
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,498
I worked a suicide hot line,
I manned a runaway center.

331
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:45,626
Adopted dolphins, taught sign language,
trained Seeing Eye dogs.

332
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,377
When did you have time for a life?

333
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,630
I'll have a life
after I graduate from Harvard.

334
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:54,092
If you'll excuse me, the drainage
on the south side of this place sucks.

335
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,262
- Hi.
- Madeline.

336
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:58,680
Bye.

337
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,108
- You look good in dirt.
- Dean, hi.

338
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,402
- So how was it?
- Long day.

339
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,907
The day is over. Let's talk about the night.

340
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:20,661
There's a 7:30 showing of Barbarella.
You can bring your mom's purse...

341
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:24,456
the one with that monkey face,
and we'll sneak in some burgers...

342
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,874
- What?
- I can't.

343
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,876
- Get your mom's purse?
- I can't do anything.

344
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,254
- Why not?
- Because I have a lot of planning to do.

345
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,588
What planning?

346
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,216
I'm 10 years behind
on my extracurriculars.

347
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,551
What are you talking about?

348
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,095
Paris has been accumulating them
since she could walk.

349
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,640
She's done enough good deeds to bump
Mother Teresa off the Harvard list.

350
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,016
Okay, I'm lost.

351
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,143
I've been studying my butt off
my whole life...

352
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,229
and I really thought that was enough.

353
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,773
Then Paris tells me
that everyone makes good grades.

354
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,692
It's the extras that put you over the top.

355
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,319
I thought she was messing with me
like she always does...

356
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:57,656
- but she's right. It makes total sense.
- What does?

357
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,784
Good grades aren't enough.
I need to do things.

358
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:04,454
I need to volunteer, work for charity,
help the blind, the orphans.

359
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,498
I don't know, I just need to do something.

360
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,667
Fine, what does this
have to do with tonight?

361
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,002
I need to start now.

362
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,629
You have to help the blind
and the orphans now?

363
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,506
Didn't I tell you I was 10 years behind?

364
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,508
You can't make up for 10 years
in one night.

365
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,011
I know. I just need to get organized.

366
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,846
Rory, it's summer.

367
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,098
Summer's the time to hang out
and kick back.

368
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,391
I can't hang out or kick back.

369
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:27,686
I need to find a retarded kid
and teach him how to play softball.

370
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:32,232
Oh, God! Listen to me.
I am under-qualified and horrible.

371
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,651
- I thought we'd spend time together.
- We will.

372
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,820
- When?
- Tomorrow, maybe.

373
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,531
You were busy today,
so we made plans for tonight.

374
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,117
- Now you're blowing me off again.
- I'm not doing that.

375
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:45,204
- You'll go to summer school thrice a week.
- You knew about that.

376
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,332
We've been apart for a while.
I figured you wanted time with me.

377
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,625
This is about Harvard.

378
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,669
Excuse me, it's about Harvard. I forgot.

379
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,671
Okay, fine.

380
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:59,009
You're mad because I want to be sure
that I get into a good college?

381
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,054
I'm mad because
my girlfriend doesn't have time for me.

382
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,889
Stop it. This is important.

383
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,516
- And it can't wait for one night?
- No.

384
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,768
- Fine.
- Why are you acting like this?

385
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,269
- Like what?
- Like you're two?

386
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,272
I'm not going to Harvard.
I couldn't care less about Harvard.

387
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,649
I just wanted to hang with you.

388
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:17,528
But apparently, since I'm two,
maybe I'll just grow out of it.

389
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,872
I'm too tired to go out tonight, so I
won't trust my accessorizing instincts.

390
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:29,998
Tell me what you think.

391
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,209
- I have no wilderness skills.
- You hate the purse?

392
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,295
How can I get into Harvard
if I have no wilderness skills?

393
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:38,090
You'll have to give up
your dream of majoring in logging.

394
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,218
I called the Fireflies.
Do they need troop leaders? Yes.

395
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,014
'I'll be a troop leader. ' The only catch is
it's summer, camping season.

396
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:49,560
I need wilderness skills.
Why did you never take me camping?

397
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,688
I couldn't get you to step on wet grass
until you were three.

398
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,232
If you'd taken me camping,
I'd have wilderness skills.

399
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,985
I'll take you upstairs
and throw you out the window.

400
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,070
If you can grab the tree,
I'll be your witness.

401
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,614
I called the Sunnyside Home.
'Do they need volunteers?'

402
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:05,367
They don't,
but they do need an accordion player...

403
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,910
for their Friday night polka party.

404
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,037
Why didn't I force you to learn
the accordion?

405
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:13,750
The library was closed. They only have
12 books, so I'm not counting on that.

406
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,546
If the tutoring program at Chilton
is still taking names, I can do that.

407
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,424
- Honey, calm down.
- I'm not prepared. I will never catch up.

408
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:24,178
You will catch up, but not in one night.
You've made your lists and calls.

409
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,138
Why don't you relax,
call Dean to come over?

410
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,140
- We're in a fight.
- Why?

411
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:32,227
- Because you never took me camping.
- Oh, boy, I'm really sucking tonight.

412
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,605
We were supposed to hang out,
I told him I couldn't.

413
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,065
He got mad, and we're in a fight.

414
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:40,319
Listen, why don't I cancel on Max tonight?

415
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,529
I'll hang out with you,
we can make popcorn...

416
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:45,491
reminisce about how I never forced you
to become a missionary.

417
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:48,660
No, go. I'm fine.
I just need to focus on this.

418
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:51,497
- I can help.
- No, I need to do this alone.

419
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,499
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

420
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:59,379
I'm not going to be home late.
Listen, I would reconsider calling Dean.

421
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:03,425
It's not his fault that you're so fabulous
he can't think about anything else.

422
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:06,428
He just sits in his room,
eating Froot Loops out of the box...

423
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,555
saying your name over and over.

424
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:12,476
- Time is ticking.
- 'Rory, I love you. I will not be ignored. '

425
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,853
- Leave.
- I'll be home early. Bye.

426
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,363
- You hate your dinner.
- No, I don't.

427
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,656
You've hardly touched it.

428
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:29,785
When somebody takes trouble
to make your entr�e look like a hat...

429
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,495
you hate to mess it up.

430
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,413
- Is something wrong?
- No.

431
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,999
You can tell me. That's what I'm here for.

432
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,585
- I thought it was just for eye candy.
- That, too.

433
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,671
I'm fine. It's just stuff.

434
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:45,884
Rory's freaking out about not having
enough extracurricular things...

435
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,719
to impress Harvard with.

436
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:51,306
- I can help her with that.
- I'm sure she'd greatly appreciate it.

437
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,725
- Is that all that's wrong?
- Yeah.

438
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:58,021
It's just a lot of stuff
to think about for the wedding.

439
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:01,733
I forgot to tell you.
I saw my parents today.

440
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:04,278
They just wanted me to tell you
how thrilled they are.

441
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:07,322
My mother cried twice.
She said you don't have to call her 'Mom. '

442
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:09,575
- But you're welcome to if you want.
- Really?

443
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:13,162
Then my father gave me a long talk
about marriage...

444
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:16,665
- and the ways of making a wife happy.
- Dirty talk.

445
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,584
Then they gave me this.

446
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,713
- No, they did not.
- Yes, they did, too.

447
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,632
Did you tell them that we're paying
for everything ourselves?

448
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:26,717
I did.

449
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,637
Sookie's doing the cake, the ceremony's
at my house, Patty's supplying chairs...

450
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:31,722
$35?

451
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:36,143
It's the first of four installments,
so we can't spend it all in one place.

452
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,146
- That is so cute.
- They just want to be involved.

453
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:42,858
That's really sweet. Can I... Thanks.

454
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,694
My mother even offered you
her wedding dress.

455
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:49,615
Since three of you could fit into that dress,
I took the liberty of declining it.

456
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:50,949
Hope she wasn't insulted.

457
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:54,328
No, I just told her
you were wearing your mother's dress.

458
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,830
It doesn't matter whether you are or not.

459
00:24:56,914 --> 00:25:00,209
- She just wanted to offer something.
- Let's get dessert.

460
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,002
- Are you okay?
- I just think it's great.

461
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:06,548
It's great that your parents are so happy
and into everything.

462
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,133
That must be nice to have that.

463
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:12,012
Think of it this way: Now they're
your parents, too. You'll have that, also.

464
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:16,266
Yes, I will think of it like that.
That is exactly how I will think of it.

465
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,351
Good.

466
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:20,812
Otherwise, I'd have to look at it like,
'Max has parents who love him...

467
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,689
'and care about him, and I have parents. '

468
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:25,651
- I didn't mean to upset you.
- I'm not upset.

469
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,028
I can't get that one moment
out of my mind.

470
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,614
'That's nice. I hope we're in town. '

471
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,574
Who reacts like that?

472
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:37,538
What sort of mind forms that reaction to:
'Hey, Mom, I'm getting married'?

473
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:39,748
From all you've told me
about your parents...

474
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:42,084
there's so much baggage
between you guys.

475
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,253
You figure out a different way.

476
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:48,173
You tap into compassion
or family obligation.

477
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,634
- You don't react like that.
- I agree. It's wrong.

478
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:53,679
You can't change who they are.
You won't get anywhere trying to.

479
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,806
I don't want to talk
about my parents anymore.

480
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:59,309
I don't want to speculate about them
or analyze them or think about them.

481
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:02,187
- We should go.
- Come on, it's still early.

482
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:05,691
We'll go someplace else.
Talk a little bit more?

483
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:09,528
Yes. Absolutely. Sounds good.

484
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,950
I'm sorry tonight brought up
these bad feelings for you.

485
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,994
That's okay. Make a right.

486
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:20,998
But I bet this was harder for your mother
than you think it is.

487
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:24,001
Look what's happened to her
over the last year.

488
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:27,754
She's getting back into your life,
and suddenly everything changes on her.

489
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:30,340
Yeah, that's got to suck. Go right.

490
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:34,261
Maybe once we get married,
things will settle down.

491
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,889
You two will be able to work it out.
You never know.

492
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:40,809
I might be able to help the situation.
Act as a buffer or so.

493
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,937
That's a good thought. Pull in here.

494
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,733
Lorelai, hold on.

495
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:52,362
I know what's going on.
I got to tell you, it's not a good idea.

496
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:53,822
This will take a second.

497
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:56,200
You should wait until tomorrow.
Calm down a little.

498
00:26:56,241 --> 00:27:00,037
- Maybe you'll be more objective.
- You are not asleep. Come on.

499
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,997
You are way too emotional for this.

500
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,167
I'm just emotional enough.
If you like, you can wait in the car...

501
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,086
because I really don't plan
on being here that long.

502
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,171
What on earth...

503
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:12,049
Hi, Mom.
Do you have a sec to chat? Super.

504
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:16,011
- Lorelai, what is this?
- I just wanted to see how you were.

505
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,263
- I'm fine.
- You are? Good.

506
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,266
I'm glad that you're fine.
I, however, am not fine.

507
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,977
We were about to go to bed.
We can do this in the morning.

508
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:27,564
Actually, no. We can't do this
in the morning. We need to do it now.

509
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:30,609
- Are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk. I'm confused.

510
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:31,985
- About what?
- About you.

511
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,612
What about me confuses you?

512
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:38,492
So many things. For example,
why can't you keep a maid in this house?

513
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,245
A thousand women
must have gone through here...

514
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,832
in the 32 years that I've been alive.
Not one of them could stick it out.

515
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,500
This is what we need to discuss now?

516
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:50,546
These are women from countries having
dictatorships, civil wars, death squads.

517
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,214
All of that, they survived.

518
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:56,176
Five minutes working for Emily Gilmore,
and people are begging for Castro.

519
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,261
I'm going to bed now.

520
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:01,014
Why is it that when your only daughter
tells you she is getting married...

521
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:03,934
you can't muster up
even a little enthusiasm?

522
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:07,563
Even a little fake enthusiasm?
Why don't you pretend that you care?

523
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:11,400
This is the biggest thing to happen to me,
possibly for the rest of my life.

524
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,901
You dismissed it, like I said:

525
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:15,320
'I'm thinking of getting a Honda.
What do you think?'

526
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:18,615
- You're obviously hysterical.
- Why don't you care?

527
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:21,076
Why have you never cared?

528
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,079
No matter what has happened to me
my entire life...

529
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:27,082
you've never been happy for me.
And that hurts, Mom.

530
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,001
- It really hurts.
- I'm not discussing this.

531
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,629
Do you know how it felt for me
to tell you that I was getting married...

532
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,673
and to have you just brush it off like that?

533
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:37,384
- Do you know?
- No, I don't know!

534
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,429
Possibly similar to finding out
from a complete stranger...

535
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:44,266
my only daughter was getting married
and had told everyone else in the world...

536
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:48,520
before she bothered to tell her mother!
Possibly it felt something like that.

537
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:52,357
Now if you will excuse me,
it is late and I am going to bed.

538
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:13,128
My parents would really like
to have lunch...

539
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:17,132
with you and Mr. Gilmore sometime soon.

540
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,011
Nice meeting you.

541
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:32,105
- I don't care.
- I just need a quick opinion.

542
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:36,151
It took me two seconds to tell you
I don't care. That's as quick as I get.

543
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:39,446
This is Lorelai's engagement party.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime event.

544
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,032
- I want it to be perfect.
- I am working.

545
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,868
- Just pick a cookie!
- I don't want to.

546
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,578
Michel, for the rest of their lives...

547
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:49,414
Lorelai and Max will think back
on their engagement party.

548
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:52,793
They're going to talk about three things:
The friends who came...

549
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:56,338
the special song they danced to,
and the cookies that they ate.

550
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:58,715
Their world is very small, isn't it?

551
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,884
Macaroons or chocolate praline?

552
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:02,928
Go back to the cooking room.

553
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,639
Not until you eat these
and tell me what you think.

554
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,225
Sookie, I only eat 1,500 calories a day.

555
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,478
If I eat that,
I cannot have my Boca Burger later.

556
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,606
Hey, Sookie. Is there any coffee left?

557
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,359
- I had a really lousy night.
- Oh, sorry.

558
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,653
I've been so busy,
I didn't even think about it.

559
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,613
That's okay. I'll make some myself.

560
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:26,243
No, I'll make it! I want to make it!
Let me do it.

561
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,078
I'll make the coffee.

562
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,913
- Relax. You're busy.
- No, I'm not.

563
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,416
Go back to the counter. MicheI's stealing.

564
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:38,755
Oh, my God.

565
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,759
- What is this?
- The dinner special.

566
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,470
The dinner special
is a heart-shaped pastry...

567
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,723
with 'Max and Lorelai' written on it?

568
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,474
I couldn't find any good salmon.

569
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,103
You're throwing me
a wedding shower, aren't you?

570
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:56,356
- It was supposed to be a surprise.
- Oh, my God!

571
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,986
- This is amazing, Sookie, even for you!
- Wait till you see the ice sculptures.

572
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,863
- When is it?
- Tonight.

573
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,116
So your yen to hit the bingo parlor
in Enfield was...

574
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,409
A vicious lie.

575
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,454
This is really incredible.

576
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,873
Is there any pink icing left on the planet?

577
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,959
The whole town is in on it.
It's going to be quite the affair.

578
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,503
You'll be impressed...

579
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:20,214
with the amount of people
that want to celebrate with you.

580
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:21,507
- No.
- Right.

581
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,509
I can't get over this.

582
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,763
You didn't, by any chance,
invite my parents, did you?

583
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:31,475
I did. At first, I was really torn,
because I know you have issues.

584
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,395
But it is your wedding, and I assumed
you wanted them to be there.

585
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:39,358
- Oh, no. Your mother told you.
- Sort of.

586
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:44,154
I thought I mentioned
that it was a surprise. Maybe I didn't.

587
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:47,825
That would be so typical of me.
The cat's already out of the bag.

588
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,494
I'm stuffing imported chocolate squares
down my shirt...

589
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:52,955
so you don't see me
walk into the kitchen with them.

590
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,957
Did your mother mention
if they were coming?

591
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,416
She never got back to me.

592
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,378
- No, she's got a thing tonight.
- Too bad.

593
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,923
- We can save her a piece of cake.
- That would be nice.

594
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:16,186
Attention, guests,
the buffet line is clogging in Sector B.

595
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,565
I repeat, Sector B is moving too slow.

596
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,692
Keep it moving, people.

597
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,861
Hey, Mr. DJ, put a record on.

598
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,237
- How's it sound?
- Great.

599
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,074
I'm trying to find a blend between
not too clich�-sounding traditional tunes...

600
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:31,076
with outer-left-field, should-be standards.

601
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,289
The Sinatra medley was great.
And skip anything else by The Damned.

602
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,917
- What time is it?
- It's 8:00.

603
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,378
- What time do you leave?
- I have a 10:00 flight.

604
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,338
Have I told you I'm going to miss you?

605
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:45,257
- Write me, constantly.
- Every day.

606
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,593
Cards and letters,
full of hope and 'see you soon. '

607
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:50,137
I'll be tying yellow ribbons
around the old oak trees.

608
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,638
I will be back for the wedding.

609
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:54,057
- You better be.
- Just don't let her change the date.

610
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:57,769
Won't happen. Max is teaching a summer
course at the University of Toronto.

611
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:59,938
If you're back by summer's end,
it will be fine.

612
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:02,024
- Don't say 'if. '
- Right.

613
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:08,614
I don't know if you realize
that every gift so far has been for you.

614
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:13,035
In this town, I am the queen.
You are simply my jester.

615
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,579
A position I happily accept.

616
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:19,708
Come on, then. How can you stand
to leave all this for two months?

617
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,252
You think Toronto will make you
into an ice sculpture?

618
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,379
- I don't think so.
- I wish you'd come with me.

619
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,965
- I have to work.
- Two months is a long time.

620
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,258
I know.

621
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,303
Will you still want me when I get back?

622
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,430
I think there's a very good possibility...

623
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:37,184
that I will be just as infatuated
with you then as I am now.

624
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,645
- Maybe more.
- Maybe more.

625
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:50,823
Come on, ladies. Hurry up.
Love waits for no one.

626
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:54,827
Lucy, get off of Jenny's train.
All right, bouquets up.

627
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,995
And music.

628
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,174
How come you're not up there, Kirk?

629
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:12,177
Oh, I don't tap anymore. Bum knees.

630
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:17,057
I'm worried about this gazebo
holding up all those hoofers.

631
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,893
They never did a trial run, like I requested.

632
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:21,645
I think it's okay.

633
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,605
The studs are definitely sound...

634
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:26,233
the two-by-fours are
a nice Number 2 structural grade.

635
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,026
Or better, possibly.

636
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,697
I built a house yesterday.

637
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,283
Oh, for Pete's sake.

638
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:39,246
No tossing of the Jordan almonds.
I repeat, put the almonds down.

639
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,668
This is quite a party.

640
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:48,380
Elegant and understated,
just like my mother.

641
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:52,301
So, how are you?

642
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:54,887
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Me?

643
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:58,182
- I'm an idiot.
- No, you're not.

644
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,517
- I'm so sorry, Rory.
- I'm sorry, too.

645
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,395
- I don't know what happened.
- We had a fight, that's all.

646
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:06,523
- I've just missed you and...
- I missed you, too.

647
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,484
I got jealous of Harvard, which is crazy...

648
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,904
'cause I love the fact
that you're going to Harvard.

649
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:15,908
You have to do something
that's going to help you get there...

650
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,745
I don't even really understand it myself.

651
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,288
I didn't help.

652
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:24,958
- I was all wigged out when I got home.
- You had all the right to be.

653
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:28,754
It's that when it comes to Harvard,
sometimes I get a little tunnel vision.

654
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:32,382
- And it's getting closer...
- You do not have to explain.

655
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,511
But I don't want you to feel unimportant,
because you're not.

656
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:37,221
- I'm glad.
- I mean it.

657
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,097
You could only be more important to me...

658
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,391
if you had a Kit Kat
growing out of your head.

659
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:43,894
I can't make promises, but I'll give it a try.

660
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:45,687
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

661
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:49,024
I'm not going to a fancy school.
I don't have that kind of pressure.

662
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,485
I can't even imagine
what that must feel like.

663
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:54,488
You could go to a fancy school
if you wanted to.

664
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,115
- I don't think so.
- Why not? You're smart.

665
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,493
- No, you're smart.
- You are, too.

666
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:02,496
I could help you organize
your extracurricular activities...

667
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,039
because I'm now an expert at it.

668
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,959
- I don't...
- How are your wilderness skills?

669
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,670
- What?
- Do you accept my apology?

670
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,880
Yeah, I accept your apology.

671
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:30,774
You okay?

672
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,614
You know, I'll be right back.

673
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,286
Only three treats per person.
No hogging of the treats.

674
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:44,997
If caught with more than three treats
on a plate...

675
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,375
you will be faced with possible expulsion
from said party.

676
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,461
- Kirk, could I see that for a sec?
- Sure.

677
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:53,839
Thanks.

678
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,896
Why aren't you at your party?

679
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:12,274
That's funny,
I was about to ask you the same thing.

680
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:15,569
- I just got kind of busy here.
- Yes, I can see that.

681
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,155
They keep making that ketchup
slower and slower.

682
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:20,741
It's the Heinz family's little joke.

683
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,535
It's really pretty crazy out there.

684
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:26,038
- I can imagine.
- Lots of people all having fun.

685
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,332
- Just the kind of thing you'd hate.
- Sounds awful.

686
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:31,043
- You would be miserable.
- Yes, I would.

687
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:35,005
In spite of all that, I was thinking,
and you don't have to...

688
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:38,675
that maybe you could
pull yourself away for a second.

689
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:45,474
Finish the ketchup tonight, but leave
the Worcestershire sauce for tomorrow.

690
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:47,684
- I'll see how it goes.
- Okay.

691
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:54,358
It's a big night for me tonight,
and it feels like you should be there.

692
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:59,196
Anyway, I'll let you
get back to your ketchup.

693
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:12,501
- The macaroons are going like hot cakes.
- Yeah, everything's a big success.

694
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,586
Look at all this. Isn't it beautiful?

695
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,089
I know it's clich�d, but it is so romantic.

696
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,467
It makes you giddy
in a sappy kind of way, doesn't it?

697
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:23,637
- Sure, I guess.
- I hope they're happy.

698
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,098
What am I saying?
How could they not be happy?

699
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:29,726
They're in love. They have each other.
Everything's perfect!

700
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,687
Okay, I get it.

701
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:33,438
Jackson, what are you...

702
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,732
You think I need a piano
to fall on my head?

703
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:39,486
I don't think anyone
needs a piano to fall on their head.

704
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,071
All the marriage talk...

705
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:44,783
and the 'Jackson, you should see
Lorelai's ring. It's so beautiful. '

706
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:48,787
- It is.
- I understand. I'm hip, okay?

707
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:52,207
We've hit that point in our relationship
where the hints are starting...

708
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,626
that will be followed by
the where-are-we-going talk.

709
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,211
That'll only end in an ultimatum.

710
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:59,840
- Suddenly all hell breaks loose!
- Okay, no more sugar for you.

711
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,593
So I think I need to say this right now.

712
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:06,221
- I'm not ready for marriage.
- Okay.

713
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:09,057
However, I'd be willing to move in.

714
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:12,102
- Move in where?
- Move in with you.

715
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:16,815
- Jackson, you're hilarious.
- I am?

716
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:21,028
'I'll move in with you. ' What a riot!

717
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,447
- Why are you laughing?
- Your face.

718
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:26,533
- God, you are good!
- I wasn't joking.

719
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,536
Come on, let's go get some punch.

720
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,747
I'm serious. I'm moving in.

721
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:35,375
Jackson, stop. You're giving me a cramp.

722
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,336
Sookie, get back here.

723
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,882
Marina, the door, please.

724
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:12,556
Thanks.

725
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:16,560
Hey, Mom.

726
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:21,273
I was in the neighborhood
because there's that wedding dress place.

727
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,525
Elizabeth Taylor
bought one of her dresses there.

728
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,777
I was trying to make a decision
about a veil.

729
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:30,365
I thought you might have an opinion
about which one would look best on me...

730
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:32,743
'cause you know me.

731
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:36,622
I thought I'd stop by and ask you
which one you thought would be good.

732
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:37,831
On me.

733
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:39,958
So which one?

734
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:46,006
You're quite capable
of choosing that yourself, Lorelai.

735
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:53,680
I'm sorry.

736
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:56,099
All right, you're sorry.

737
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,854
I don't know how to tell you things, Mom.

738
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:07,444
I don't know if you've noticed this or not,
but we don't communicate very well.

739
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,280
When something good happens to me...

740
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,325
I'm just afraid you're going to
make me feel bad about it.

741
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:14,993
When something bad happens to me...

742
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,497
I'm always afraid you'll say,
'I told you so. '

743
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:22,751
I'm not sure if that's always fair.

744
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:27,047
And I'm sure I share part of the blame
for this circle we get into.

745
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:31,385
You think your words
don't have any effect on me.

746
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,554
But they do.

747
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:40,561
I just didn't want to feel bad about this.

748
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:42,521
So I waited.

749
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:47,442
And I really didn't mean to hurt you.

750
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:01,206
I will let you get back to that letter there.

751
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,752
Your head is much too big for a veil.

752
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,841
You might consider a tiara.

753
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:16,930
A tiara?

754
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:21,602
That's what I wore.

755
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:27,816
Okay.

756
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:31,695
I'll think about that.

757
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,081
English
