1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:03,896
What about Rory?

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,857
I don't like what I see in that girl.

3
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:07,678
My eyes?

4
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:08,991
She's lost focus.

5
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:10,733
She's drifting, aimless.

6
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:12,703
You know she's joined the DAR?

7
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:13,897
I saw the picture in the paper.

8
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,876
She's running around, planning tea
parties like she's the mad hatter.

9
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:21,618
All she talks about are seating charts and
canapÃ©s and fund-raisers and that boy.

10
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:22,711
You mean Logan?

11
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:25,997
She's heading in the wrong direction,
and I don't like it.

12
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:29,498
Now, I've thought long and hard about this,
and I've come to a decision.

13
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:31,081
We need a plan.

14
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:32,006
But--

15
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:33,813
We--

16
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,116
I had a plan.

17
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:38,176
You changed the plan.

18
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:39,608
Plan's gone, baby.

19
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,863
I don't appreciate your tone.

20
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,847
Apparently the proper tone
went out with the plan.

21
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:45,437
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Rory's not headed back to school.

22
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:46,713
Not yet, anyhow.

23
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:47,543
Not yet?

24
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:48,969
Not now, not ever.

25
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:50,553
Listen to me for just a moment.

26
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:51,875
We can fix this.

27
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:55,151
First of all,
I can change the terms of Rory's trust fund.

28
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:58,175
Currently, she's set to receive
it when she turns 25,

29
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:01,599
but I say we tell her it's contingent
on her returning to Yale.

30
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:04,825
Or we can use the opposite approach,
if you think it's better.

31
00:01:04,886 --> 00:01:08,194
Maybe we offer her a car or the
down payment on a town house.

32
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,927
Or I'll buy her the town house.

33
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,361
Don't you see?
If there's something in it for her,
maybe we can get her to change her mind.

34
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,421
Thank you for the dollhouse, dad.

35
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:17,703
It's greatly appreciated.

36
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:18,738
I don't believe this.

37
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:19,847
Aren't you listening to me?

38
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:20,769
Uh, no.

39
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:25,071
Lorelai, Rory is turning 21 years old
in 10 days. Do you realize that?

40
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,101
Yes, dad, I realize it.

41
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,356
She's 21.

42
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:29,514
That's not a child.

43
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:32,114
21-year-olds need to be working
towards something.

44
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,621
Rory will figure it out.

45
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:36,856
Oh, please, she's 21.
I couldn't tie my shoe at 21.

46
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:39,429
Well, Rory's advanced.
She had the shoe thing down at 3.

47
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:40,567
I'm getting a little tired--

48
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:42,895
No, I'm getting a little tired
of this conversation.

49
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:44,565
I'm not interested in your plan.

50
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm not going to bribe my daughter
with cars and money,

51
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:52,057
mainly because it wouldn't work,
and if you'd ever met Rory,
you would know it wouldn't work.

52
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,174
Rory can't be bought,
and I'm not gonna try and buy her.

53
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,249
I want Rory to want to go back to school.

54
00:01:57,307 --> 00:02:00,034
She used to love to learn and read and study.

55
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,910
And that was freakish, but it was her.

56
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:03,924
And she's got to get herself back there.

57
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:05,779
- But--
- No, when Rory wants help,

58
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,472
she will ask for it. And the minute she does,

59
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:10,927
I will fly in faster than the Gulfstream
you're gonna offer to buy her next.

60
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:12,840
But until then, I'm sorry,
you're on your own.

61
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:13,917
Impossible girl.

62
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:15,864
My native American name, I believe.

63
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:17,009
Unbelievable. He's unbelievable.

64
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,014
He sure is. How did he lift this thing?

65
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:22,530
Pretending like it's an accident
that Rory's still floundering.

66
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:25,596
Nothing's an accident. He caused this.
He made this happen.

67
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:27,632
It must weigh a thousand pounds.

68
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:30,359
That was a low blow,
bringing up Rory's birthday like that.

69
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,861
"She's turning 21, Lorelai.
Did you know that?"

70
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:34,866
Of course I know that.

71
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,414
I was there when she was turning nothing.

72
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:38,366
I know she's turning 21.

73
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:40,992
Does this thing have, like,
a real foundation or something?

74
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:43,185
It's just like my parents, you know,
to double-cross me

75
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:46,169
then get mad when I won't help
them undo the double cross.

76
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:47,686
Did he have guys with him?

77
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,219
What?

78
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,666
Guys to help him lift this thing.

79
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:50,461
No, no guys.

80
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,384
No guys? Your dad is Hercules.

81
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,162
We had plans.

82
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:55,817
What?

83
00:03:58,145 --> 00:03:59,948
We were gonna go to Atlantic City.

84
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,276
We were gonna sit at a blackjack
table at 11:59,

85
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,830
we were gonna order martinis,

86
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:10,755
and we were gonna be playing
21 when she turned 21.

87
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:16,256
And then hopefully we'd win, and we'd take
our winnings and we'd buy 21 things.

88
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:21,277
And then there was a thing about 21 guys that
wouldn't really be appropriate anymore

89
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,602
since the engagement, but it was a good plan.

90
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:29,042
She probably doesn't even remember the plan.

91
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,638
She remembers the plan.

92
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,103
It wasn't like we talked about it every day.
It was just something we thought of.

93
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,111
She remembers the plan.

94
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:38,804
I'm hungry. I'm ordering pizza.

95
00:04:42,392 --> 00:04:43,823
The top comes off.

96
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,360
Of course it does.

97
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:58,794
Happy birthday, little girl

98
00:04:58,941 --> 00:04:59,839
Hey.

99
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:03,673
I can't believe how fast you're growing up.

100
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:06,245
Really? Feels slow.

101
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,323
Trust me, it's fast.

102
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:11,208
So, what do you think of your life so far?

103
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:12,892
I think it's pretty good.

104
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:14,320
Any complaints?

105
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:17,402
I'd like that whole humidity
thing to go away.

106
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,699
I'll work on that.

107
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,625
So, do I look older?

108
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:25,173
Oh, yeah. Walk into Denny's before 5:00,
you got yourself a discount.

109
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:26,293
Good deal.

110
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:28,096
So, you know what I think?

111
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,054
What?

112
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:34,063
I think you're a great, cool kid and
the best friend a girl could have.

113
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,386
Back at ya.

114
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:41,846
And it's so hard to believe that,
at exactly this time many moons ago,

115
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:45,106
I was lying in exactly the same position.

116
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:46,773
Oh, boy, here we go.

117
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:51,272
Only I had a fat stomach and huge ankles
and I was swearing like a sailor...

118
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,408
...on leave.

119
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:54,857
On leave, right. And there I was...

120
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,108
in labor...

121
00:05:56,195 --> 00:06:01,059
and while there's some who call it the most
meaningful experience of their life...

122
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:05,627
...you compare it to something more akin to
doing the splits on a crate of dynamite.

123
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,982
Right.

124
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:09,847
I wonder if the Waltons ever did this.

125
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:13,728
What?

126
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,270
I just had a dream that Madeleine
Albright was my mother.

127
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,178
Hmm.

128
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,630
Hey, there.

129
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:36,167
Oh, hi, sugar.
Couldn't see you over the bags.

130
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:38,670
Wow, you got a lot of stuff there.
You hunkering down for winter?

131
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:41,196
Nah, we're getting our supplies
for our gallows.

132
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:43,156
Oh, yeah, you're gonna hang Morey again?

133
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:44,149
Do it every year.

134
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,533
You're always the hit of the neighborhood.

135
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,165
What about you, honey? What are you gonna do?

136
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:48,836
You know, the same thing I always do.

137
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:49,789
Oh.

138
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:52,440
Gonna hang caramel apples
from the tree again?

139
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,061
- The kids love 'em.
- Yeah.

140
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,930
They're not that scary.

141
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,432
Well, to a diabetic,
they're downright terrifying.

142
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,412
Huh? Okay. Caramel apples.

143
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:05,102
And I will be handing out candy, which,
you know, is the entire point of Halloween.

144
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,439
Sure, honey.

145
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:08,604
Well, we got a lot to do. We got to go.

146
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:09,835
No rest for the doomed.

147
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,056
See you later.

148
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:14,848
You know, I-I-I bought a haunted house
CD to play in the background.

149
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,788
What time is our reservation?

150
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:25,614
Now.

151
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:26,362
Oh.

152
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:28,608
It's amazing what happens when
you can't find your keys.

153
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:30,371
I think we should order in tonight.

154
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,874
And the purse is down.

155
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:36,339
Who is it?

156
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,677
Emily Gilmore.

157
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:49,954
I'm so sorry to bother you, Rory.

158
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:51,648
- Hello, Logan.
- Hello, Emily.

159
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,497
Rory, could you check your closets?

160
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:57,009
The maid hung up your dry cleaning
today and I am missing a blouse,

161
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,696
and I want to know whether or not to add this
to the list of reasons I'm firing her.

162
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:02,222
Of course. I'll be right back.

163
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:03,299
Thank you, Rory.

164
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,477
I'm so exhausted with incompetent people,
I don't know what to do anymore.

165
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,375
I feel like every person I hire immediately
gets hit in the head

166
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,143
with a mallet on their way out
of the employment office.

167
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:15,757
Logan, do you have anything special planned
for Rory's birthday next week?

168
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:18,063
Uh... no, no plans.

169
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,873
Oh, good, because I would love
to throw her a party here.

170
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:23,955
A 21st birthday is so special.

171
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:28,957
But I didn't want to order 12 pounds
of crab legs if you had plans
to whisk her off to Santorini.

172
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,562
No whisking plans in the works.

173
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,936
Sorry, grandma, your blouse isn't in there.

174
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,755
Say, Rory, how would you like
a birthday party next week?

175
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:38,089
Oh, well...

176
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,904
It doesn't have to be a big, formal affair.

177
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:44,742
Just something fun with your friends and a
few of the DAR ladies, whoever you want.

178
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:47,209
Sure, grandma, a party sounds fine.

179
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,387
I'll go right in and call the caterers.

180
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,261
21 years old-- time flies, doesn't it?

181
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:56,580
All right, you two,
back to what you were doing.

182
00:08:58,667 --> 00:08:59,702
Hey, grandma says.

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,855
So, a 21st birthday-- big event.

184
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,512
I guess.

185
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:03,993
Would've been nice if I had known about it.

186
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:05,536
- Oh, I didn't tell you?
- No.

187
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:07,879
Oh, I'm just not into birthdays.

188
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:09,115
You're not into birthdays?

189
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:13,335
You, who wore green head to toe on st.
Patrick's Day and bunny ears on Easter?

190
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,539
I have stock in hallmark.

191
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,389
What's up, ace?

192
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:17,640
We should call the restaurant if
we still want to eat there.

193
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,538
Ace.

194
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,419
I'm just not excited about
this particular birthday.

195
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:22,510
Why not?

196
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:24,899
Because I'm turning 21.

197
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:26,242
Yes?

198
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,370
My mom and I have been planning
for my 21st birthday since--

199
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:33,871
well, my first memory is kindergarten,
but I have a feeling she was
talking about it before then.

200
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:35,398
We had this whole big thing planned.

201
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:36,440
Yeah?

202
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:41,571
We were gonna go to Atlantic City and
sit at a blackjack table at 11:59,

203
00:09:41,637 --> 00:09:44,739
and we'd be playing 21 when I turned 21.

204
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:47,533
We were gonna drink martinis and
win money and buy 21 things,

205
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,527
and there was this thing including 21 guys
that would be totally inappropriate

206
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:54,932
now that I'm with you.
But it was a pretty big thing, and--

207
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:57,946
and now we're not talking,
so it's not gonna happen.

208
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,668
I'm just a little bummed. That's all.

209
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:01,504
I know you miss your mom.

210
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:04,861
The concept's a little hard for me to grasp,
but I know you do.

211
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,430
Well, you never got to know her.

212
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,977
She can be pretty cool.

213
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,290
Hey, I know. I'll take you to Atlantic City.

214
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:12,088
What?

215
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:13,924
We can still play 21 when you turn 21.

216
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:17,929
we can buy the 21 things, I'd still
vote to put the kibosh on
that thing with the 21 guys.

217
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:19,426
But other than that, I'm good to go.

218
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,394
You're sweet, but it's okay.

219
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,707
Come on, I'll get a car-- 21 cars,
if you like.

220
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:27,439
No. No, I appreciate the offer a lot, but

221
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:29,759
I'll just have the party and
let this birthday pass.

222
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:30,915
Are you sure?

223
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:33,037
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

224
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:34,734
And I'm hungry. You ready to go?

225
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:38,282
Where did I put my keys?

226
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,225
Oh, I think I saw them on the couch.

227
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,399
Here we go again.

228
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:48,617
You know, when I was turning 21,
I somehow got it into my head

229
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:52,687
that I simply had to have my invitations
trimmed with real pearls.

230
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:57,126
I could not be convinced that it
was at all tacky or impractical.

231
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,403
I was right,
and that was the way it had to be.

232
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:02,952
My mother was beside herself. I never heard
so much sighing in my whole life.

233
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:06,504
But in the end, she found me invitations
lined with real pearls,

234
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:09,129
and I felt like the most important
girl in the world.

235
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:13,483
So, come on, tell me-- which ones are
your pearl-trimmed invitations?

236
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,394
Rory!

237
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:16,517
Hmm?

238
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:17,988
You're supposed to try them all.

239
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:18,655
What?

240
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:22,874
The cake. Alfonso made us those samples.
The least we can do is try them all.

241
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,503
Oh, okay, sure.

242
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:26,740
Well, I like the lace.

243
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:27,667
Do you like the lace?

244
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,370
Sure.

245
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,883
All right. The lace it is.

246
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:34,573
Now, the food. I think we should
go buffet-- much more youthful.

247
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,161
And what do you think of sushi?
Sushi feels young, doesn't it?

248
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:39,489
I certainly hope so.

249
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:41,458
You don't want any old sushi hanging around.

250
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:44,446
Now, we'll have a bar,
heaters on the patio to stem the crowd.

251
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:49,476
Oh, do you want a special tray-passed drink,
like a sidecar maybe or a gin fizz?

252
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:51,664
I used to love a nice gin fizz.

253
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,444
Am I boring you?

254
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:55,034
No, the lace is fine.

255
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:56,463
Rory, where is your head today?

256
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,001
I don't know. I'm sorry.

257
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,913
There are a million little other
details I need to go over here.

258
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:02,825
Would you like me to just do it myself?

259
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,400
Um, sure.

260
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:06,645
You've got great taste.
I trust you completely.

261
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:07,614
All right.

262
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:11,611
Then the only thing I need from you is
a little guidance on the guest list.

263
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:14,668
Now, I have the information for the DAR
ladies, of course,

264
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:16,729
and Logan-- I have Logan's information.

265
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,799
I believe I have the address
of your Asian friend.

266
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:20,396
Lane.

267
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,388
She hasn't moved?

268
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:23,122
- Not that I know of.
- All right.

269
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:24,423
She'll want to bring her boyfriend.

270
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,167
Her boyfriend? How wonderful.
Rory's Asian friend...

271
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:28,950
- Lane.
- ...Has a boyfriend.

272
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,841
All right. Now, what about Paris?
Are you two friends?
I never really could tell.

273
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:34,123
Paris should be on the list.

274
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,338
Then Paris is on the list.

275
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:36,811
She'll want to bring her boyfriend, too.

276
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,808
My goodness.
I guess there's something in the air.

277
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,726
All right. I have the Cheevers,
your cousins from Bridgeport.

278
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:47,174
Now, do you want me to put
your mother on this list?

279
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:47,765
Mom?

280
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:49,751
It's completely up to you.
I just thought I should ask.

281
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:52,604
Yes, put mom on the list.

282
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:54,337
All right. She's on the list.

283
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:56,290
And the chocolate praline crunch is the cake.

284
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,379
A chocolate praline crunch cake.

285
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,166
A chocolate praline crunch cake
completely covered with pearls.

286
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:05,256
Ah, to be 21 again.

287
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,807
Wow! Looks great, guys.

288
00:13:17,155 --> 00:13:19,858
Yeah, we made it bigger this year.

289
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,546
And we added a great new light effect to
help Morey's face look more distorted

290
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,969
when he drops because, you know,
when you really get hanged,

291
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:28,948
your eyeballs sometimes explode and
your tongue splits down the middle.

292
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:30,444
It's disgusting. Wanna see?

293
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:30,982
Uh--

294
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:32,834
- Morey, shake a leg.
- Okay.

295
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:40,267
- All set.
- Okay!

296
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:42,165
Bombs away!

297
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:48,059
Now, remember, you got to twitch around
a lot, make the kids think you're
dying real slow and painful.

298
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:52,320
Obviously there'll be some blood shooting
out, some screams, but you get the picture.

299
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:53,663
I-I-I do.

300
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:54,734
Babette?

301
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:55,851
Tight, babe.

302
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,113
Do you need help, Babette?

303
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,132
Oh, no, as soon as he passes out, his muscles
relax and I can slide him right out.

304
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:02,783
- We'll be good.
- Okay.

305
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:03,979
See you guys later.

306
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,144
Luke, are you here?

307
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,204
In the kitchen.

308
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:14,488
Where's Paul Anka?

309
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:15,830
He didn't meet me at the door.

310
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,096
Peas scare him.

311
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,433
Really? Huh.

312
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,526
Peas? Cooked or raw?

313
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:22,372
Doesn't seem pleased with either form.

314
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:25,206
Okay, peas are out. What smells so good?

315
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,181
Fried chicken.

316
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,478
- Luke, will you marry me?
- Set the table?

317
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:31,537
Okay, first,
I have some very exciting news to tell you.

318
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,107
Shoot.

319
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:36,753
This year, I have decided to do a
whole new thing for Halloween.

320
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:38,578
You're not gonna hang the
caramel apples again?

321
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,310
Caramel apples aren't scary.

322
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:43,755
Well, what's scary is you opening
your house up to a mob of insane,

323
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:48,077
sugar-laced kids wearing masks that
conveniently hide any identifying features.

324
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:53,178
I have decided to do something totally
different, and I'm gonna need your help.

325
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,607
- Sure.
- Okay.

326
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,439
I want to do a skit.

327
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:57,222
Skit?

328
00:14:57,352 --> 00:15:00,574
Yes, I want to be a mad scientist. I'm gonna
come out in a blood-stained white lab coat

329
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:04,168
and freaky makeup and big, giant,
don king kind of hairdo,

330
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:07,492
and I'm going to turn the whole
front yard into my laboratory.

331
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:08,003
Wow.

332
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:11,829
Yes, I'm gonna have a huge electric chair and
an operating table and test tubes and wires.

333
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,627
Sounds elaborate.

334
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,216
You haven't heard the half of it, okay?

335
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:17,969
And so I come out and I do mad scientist
"banter," like, "hey,
who here is from Bellevue?"

336
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,493
And "'girl interrupted'?
That's my idea of a feel-good movie."

337
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,342
I'll work on it. But anyway, after that,
I'm gonna drag you out.

338
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:25,178
What?

339
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,407
You're strapped in an electric chair,

340
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,725
and I'm gonna throw the switch
and totally electrocute you.

341
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:31,930
And you're flailing around.

342
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:35,093
We'll rig something where smoke and
sparks shoot out of your nose.

343
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:38,856
And then once you're dead, I'll
throw you onto the operating
table and I'll cut you open.

344
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,854
And I pull link sausages out of you
and throw them into the crowd.

345
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:44,178
That's it?

346
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,883
Well, I mean,
we can take a bow or something, but, yeah,
that's it.

347
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:50,381
Okay. Uh, just a couple of questions here.

348
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:52,789
Once you've electrocuted me and I'm dead,

349
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:56,204
how exactly do I get to the operating table?

350
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:00,366
Uh, good question. Maybe I can position the
operating table right near the electric chair

351
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,916
so I can just flop you over
onto it after you die.

352
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:06,043
Okay, let's say we work that out.
Now I'm on the table.

353
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,524
You're gonna cut me open with what?

354
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:10,076
A big, rusty saw.

355
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:11,820
And then you're gonna pull
link sausages out of me.

356
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:13,404
Real slow and creepy like.

357
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,162
Okay, great. Last question.

358
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:18,326
Uh, what are the odds of you getting me
to do a skit where you electrocute me,

359
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,566
cut me open,
and pull link sausages out of me?

360
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,784
'Cause I'm thinking they're right up there
with Pia Zadora making a big comeback.

361
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,190
Oh, come on. This will be fun.

362
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,871
No way, not happening.

363
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:30,522
But this is our first Halloween together
as a full-blown, committed,
soon-to-be-married couple.

364
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:31,871
We need to start our own traditions.

365
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:35,039
I'll tell you what, I'll build you the chair,
help with the test tubes, and then I'm done.

366
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:37,796
But you would be so scary with
smoke coming out of your nose.

367
00:16:37,852 --> 00:16:38,976
I really want to see that.

368
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:42,692
We're gonna be together the rest of
our lives, so odds are you will.

369
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:44,569
- Luke--
- Chicken's burning. I got to concentrate.

370
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,834
Why don't you go find your psychotic
dog and I'll set the table?

371
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:50,065
Okay, but this discussion is not over.

372
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:53,355
Here, Paul Anka. Mommy's got your broccoli.

373
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:01,713
Out.

374
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:03,157
- Oh, come on.
- Beat it.

375
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:04,859
I can't believe you're not gonna come in.

376
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:08,375
I told you I'm meeting my father at
7:30 in the morning in New York.

377
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:09,808
I loved the dinner tonight.

378
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:10,525
I'm glad.

379
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,206
I've never had Sri Lankan food before.

380
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:13,416
I thought you'd like it.

381
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:17,196
And I appreciate you lying to me and
answering "chicken" every time
I asked you what I was eating.

382
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:19,244
15 courses-- one of them
was bound to be chicken.

383
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:20,291
And that dessert.

384
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:23,515
Do you really think you can keep talking long
enough that I forget I can't come in?

385
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:27,046
I've seen my mom do it before.
I thought maybe it was a family trait.

386
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,697
- Just for an hour.
- No.

387
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:37,967
- Half an hour?
- No.

388
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,381
- 15 minutes?
- No.

389
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:40,772
Okay, an hour.

390
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,259
You're getting better at this.

391
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,948
Ow, you bit my lip.

392
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:53,865
I didn't mean to startle you two.

393
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:56,720
I heard a noise out here and
just came to check it out.

394
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:57,992
Is everything all right?

395
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:00,279
Everything's fine, Richard.
I was just dropping Rory off.

396
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,226
Hi, grandpa.

397
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:02,191
Hello, Rory.

398
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:05,891
Well, I'll just say good night, then.

399
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:06,820
Good night, grandpa.

400
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,840
Good night, Richard.

401
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,206
Was it the Mortigans' dalmatian trying
to mate with our lion statues again?

402
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,651
No, it was not the Mortigans' dalmatian.
It was Rory and Logan.

403
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:22,759
How natural selection hasn't wiped out
dogs like that, I'll never know.

404
00:18:22,814 --> 00:18:23,651
Rory and Logan?

405
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:24,793
It was Rory and Logan.

406
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:25,833
They just came home.

407
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:27,213
Logan was dropping Rory off.

408
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,510
Well, that's nice.

409
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,356
Oh, look at this bedroom set.

410
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,175
Richard, you would love these pillows.

411
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:33,990
Seems I interrupted their goodbyes.

412
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:36,543
Oh Richard, now they're going to
think we were spying on them.

413
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,970
This settee is lovely, also.

414
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:42,031
They were engaged in a round of serious
necking when I found them.

415
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:43,359
What do you mean?

416
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:44,840
You know exactly what I mean.

417
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:47,243
You know, Richard, Rory's growing up.

418
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:47,997
Mm-hmm.

419
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:49,480
She's turning 21 next week.

420
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:52,970
Oh, is that what the flotilla of party
planners outside our door was about?

421
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,805
Logan is certainly a very
experienced young man.

422
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:58,121
Man of the world, Emily, man of the world.

423
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,081
You know, Richard, it might be that time.

424
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:00,967
What time?

425
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:03,392
She might be getting ready to
have relations with that boy.

426
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:06,607
Oh Emily, please. Have you seen the
size of that sports car of his?

427
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:09,447
There's no room to cross your legs,
much less anything else.

428
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:12,635
The car is not the only place they're
getting affectionate, Richard.

429
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:15,100
I walked in on them the other
day in the pool house.

430
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:18,880
They were very cozy on the couch, and they
certainly weren't looking for her keys.

431
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:19,757
Do you really think?

432
00:19:19,822 --> 00:19:21,017
I really think.

433
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:22,428
Well we have to do something.

434
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,995
If she's getting ready to take that step,
we have to do something.

435
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,304
I couldn't agree more.

436
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:27,114
Tomorrow.

437
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:28,205
Tomorrow.

438
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,706
I am in love with this bedroom set.

439
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:38,550
Okay, so, what kind of link sausage
would you like to pull out of Luke?

440
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:39,971
I'm not sure. Nothing too wimpy.

441
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:41,791
Luke's a big guy,
so he needs big-guy sausage.

442
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:42,780
Don't we all.

443
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:44,421
Don't make my man's sausage dirty.

444
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:47,107
Well, you could go kielbasa.
That's a big-guy sausage.

445
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:50,183
I guess. Technically, Luke hasn't agreed
to let me pull anything out of him.

446
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,245
- Small detail.
- Miniscule roadblock.

447
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:56,509
Well, personally, I love the Louisiana sweet
sausage 'cause it has the nicest flavor--

448
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:58,207
a little bite, but not too overwhelming.

449
00:19:58,274 --> 00:20:01,303
I'm not gonna eat the sausage.
I'm going to pull it out of Luke.

450
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,281
- Mail just came.
- Oh, thanks.

451
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,286
Well, if you're just going by looks,
I'd go cajun because it's red.

452
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:12,981
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

453
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:14,130
It's not nothing.

454
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:16,980
It's an invitation to Rory Gilmore's
21st birthday party.

455
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:18,759
Wow. Look at all that lace.

456
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:20,343
Man, that's a pretty invitation.

457
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,180
Sure is.

458
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,179
Are you going to go?

459
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,127
This isn't from Rory.
This is from my dad via my mom.

460
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:25,783
It is?

461
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,355
Oh yes. It's just my dad trying to manipulate
me and get me involved
in a plan to manipulate Rory.

462
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:31,416
But you had a plan.

463
00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:32,324
I know.

464
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:33,883
Boy, they are determined.

465
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,877
Determined, demented, de-lovely.

466
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,916
I can't believe Rory's turning 21.

467
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:40,588
It seems like just yesterday she
was crying because you told her

468
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,080
Charlotte Bronte couldn't come to
her sleepover because she's dead.

469
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:46,120
I'm gonna go check the reservation book.

470
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:47,340
Too much Rory talk.

471
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,616
Oh, just a tad. It's making me bummed, so...

472
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:51,492
We could go back to our sausage talk.

473
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,286
Maybe later.

474
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,991
Oh, my god, it smells good in here.

475
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:02,416
Well, I see someone got
our dinner invitation.

476
00:21:02,484 --> 00:21:04,037
Yes, I did, and thank you.

477
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:07,169
It's been weeks since I've had anything
that hasn't been supersized for dinner.

478
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:11,711
You've been so busy lately, I had to
resort to pot roast and mashed
potatoes to get you here.

479
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:12,880
Pot roast and mashed potatoes?

480
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:16,531
With baby carrots, parker house rolls,
and ice cream sundaes for dessert.

481
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:17,915
Wow. Am I dying?

482
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:19,909
Would you grab that bottle of wine?

483
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:20,849
Sure.

484
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,537
Rory, how lovely that you could join us.

485
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:27,947
Do you know the reverend Boatwright?

486
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:29,244
Uh, no.

487
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:30,740
Oh, I can't believe that.

488
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:33,284
Reverend Boatwright has been
our minister for years.

489
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,596
By now he's more a friend than a minister.

490
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,247
Well, it's nice to meet you,
reverend Boatwright.

491
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:39,220
It's nice to meet you, too, Rory.

492
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,559
I hear pot roast is your favorite, too.

493
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:42,359
Yes, it is.

494
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:43,619
Rory, sit, sit.

495
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:46,849
It's amazing.
All the wonderful foods in this world,

496
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,597
the greatest chefs with the
most exotic ingredients,

497
00:21:49,678 --> 00:21:52,489
and yet this girl still wants pot roast.

498
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,622
Roll, reverend?

499
00:21:53,683 --> 00:21:55,349
Well, thank you. Don't mind if I do.

500
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,303
Hmm. I wonder where that salad is.

501
00:21:58,368 --> 00:21:59,603
Will you excuse me?

502
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:01,056
I'll be right back.

503
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:05,977
You know, Emily ordered some of
that wonderful Irish butter.

504
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:09,451
You haven't tasted rolls until you've
had them with Irish butter.

505
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,082
I'll be right back.

506
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,291
And then there were two.

507
00:22:15,455 --> 00:22:17,896
Your grandparents have told
me a lot about you, Rory.

508
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:18,639
Oh, yeah?

509
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:20,125
They're very proud of you, you know.

510
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:22,356
Well, then it's a mutual admiration society.

511
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,017
You have a birthday coming up next week?

512
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:24,854
21st.

513
00:22:24,925 --> 00:22:27,502
Must be wonderful being a young woman,
just turning 21.

514
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,944
The world is out there,
just waiting to be conquered.

515
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,763
I guess so.

516
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,139
I hear you have a boyfriend.

517
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:32,819
Yes.

518
00:22:32,877 --> 00:22:35,798
Ah, young love. It can be so exhilarating,
so intense--

519
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:38,305
all those feelings rushing
around inside of you.

520
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:41,484
I remember being young and having
all those crazy feelings.

521
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:42,355
Oh, yeah?

522
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,257
Oh, yes.

523
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:46,502
You know, Rory,
being a young lady comes with many gifts.

524
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:49,830
Your virtue, for example, is a gift,
a precious gift.

525
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:52,163
Possibly the most precious gift you possess.

526
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,628
Uh-huh.

527
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:55,997
You want to give this gift very carefully.

528
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:58,483
It is a gift you can give to only one man.

529
00:22:58,554 --> 00:23:00,302
Once you give it, it's gone.

530
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:01,712
You can't regift it.

531
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:04,250
If you give it away too
soon to the wrong man,

532
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:07,927
then when the right one does come along,
you have no gift to give.

533
00:23:08,006 --> 00:23:09,685
You'll have to buy him a sweater.

534
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:11,869
Do you understand what I'm saying?

535
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,761
No.

536
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:15,743
Think long and hard about
when and to whom you want

537
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:18,800
to give the ultimate gift
you have to give away.

538
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:20,108
Oh.

539
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:21,021
Yes.

540
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:22,015
Oh, dear.

541
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:23,275
Oh, dear, indeed.

542
00:23:23,394 --> 00:23:25,972
Um... well...

543
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:28,223
Listen, reverend.

544
00:23:28,294 --> 00:23:33,338
I really appreciate you taking the time
out of what I assume is a busy day

545
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:38,461
to come here and talk to me about...
all of this, but, um,

546
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:42,818
I'm afraid the ultimate-gift ship has sailed.

547
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:43,443
What?

548
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:44,489
A while ago.

549
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,192
It's probably in Fiji by now.

550
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:47,145
Oh.

551
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,006
Yeah.

552
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:50,297
Well...

553
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,491
So, have you seen "the 40-year-old virgin"?
'Cause you might like it.

554
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,626
Well, it can't go next to the sushi,
so I guess the cake will have to go in there.

555
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,216
- Maybe in the corner?
- Sounds good.

556
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:22,959
Grandma.

557
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:24,286
Oh, Rory, good.

558
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:28,510
Do you think we should have a carving station
in case some people find sushi unappealing,

559
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,243
or will the passed hors d'oeuvres be enough?

560
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,238
Either way.

561
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:34,057
"Either way" is not an opinion, Rory,
just for future reference.

562
00:24:34,134 --> 00:24:36,965
Let's have a carving station-- just beef,
no turkey.

563
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:38,569
What happened to the pool house?

564
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:39,303
What do you mean?

565
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:40,281
It's full of stuff.

566
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:42,846
Oh, yes, the rentals-- I had absolutely
nowhere to put them.

567
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,008
They said it might rain tonight, and
I couldn't leave them outside so
I just put them in the pool house.

568
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,109
But I live in the pool house.
What am I supposed to do?

569
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,529
Oh, I packed up your things and put
them in your old room upstairs.

570
00:24:50,597 --> 00:24:51,827
- Upstairs?
- Uh-huh.

571
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:52,996
The room right next to ours.

572
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:56,368
We can knock secret-code messages
to each other like we're in camp.

573
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:59,809
No, I didn't tell you to put that there.
You're fired.

574
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,784
Grandma, has mom RSVP'ed?

575
00:25:01,844 --> 00:25:03,572
I don't know, Rory. Check the list.

576
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:05,951
Yes, out now, please.

577
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:07,042
Thank you.

578
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:09,364
The list says no.

579
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:10,698
Then I guess the answer's no.

580
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:12,031
Well, that's just wrong.

581
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,154
When an invitations says "RSVP," you RSVP.

582
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,726
That's what you do. It's not rocket science.

583
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:17,812
Maybe she's still coming.

584
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:18,859
But how do we know?

585
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,510
If she doesn't call, how will we know whether
or not to make an extra chocolate box, huh?

586
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:24,550
If she doesn't call,
she won't have a chocolate box.

587
00:25:24,616 --> 00:25:26,574
We can make an extra chocolate box, Rory.

588
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:27,339
No.

589
00:25:27,415 --> 00:25:29,697
Why should we make an extra chocolate box?

590
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:32,018
I mean, we're paying for these things.

591
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:34,111
Chocolate boxes do not just grow on trees.

592
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:36,878
They're made by these hardworking
people right here,

593
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,549
and it is not right to make these people
spend hours making extra chocolate boxes

594
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,867
because people are too lazy to
make a stupid phone call!

595
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:45,415
Rory!

596
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:50,932
You're gonna be sick.

597
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:51,762
No.

598
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:53,736
It's already loaded with chocolate chips.

599
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,792
That's candy,
and you're adding whipped cream.
That's more candy.

600
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:57,810
Got any jelly beans?

601
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:59,118
I'm gonna be sick.

602
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:00,303
Oh, and a cherry.

603
00:26:01,934 --> 00:26:02,659
Luke's.

604
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:04,063
Luke, is my mother there?

605
00:26:04,117 --> 00:26:04,840
Rory?

606
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:05,690
Rory?

607
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:07,623
Yes, it's Rory. Is my mother there?

608
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,285
- That's Rory?
- I'll give her to you.

609
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:10,961
To me? That's Rory for me?

610
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:13,468
No, I just want to know if she's
coming to my birthday party.

611
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,396
She wants to know if you're coming
to her birthday party.

612
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,098
What?

613
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:17,903
We're making the chocolate boxes right now,

614
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,488
and I need to know if she's coming so I
know whether or not to make her one.

615
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:24,813
They're making the chocolate boxes,
and she needs to know if you're
coming so they can make you one.

616
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:26,064
I didn't know I was invited.

617
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,627
I sent her an invitation!

618
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:29,844
Where the hell did she think it came from?!
The invitation fairy?

619
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:31,780
She said she sent you an invitation.

620
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:34,601
I didn't know it was from her.
I didn't know it was from you!

621
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:35,679
Well, it was.

622
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:36,712
Is she coming or not?

623
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:37,697
Are you coming or not?

624
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:40,321
Yes, I-I'm coming. I want a chocolate box.

625
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:42,211
- She'll be there.
- Fine. Bye.

626
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,210
Rory called.

627
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,166
I know. She called and yelled at me.

628
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:47,935
No, she called and yelled at me.

629
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,487
Yeah, but I'm the one who had to hear it,
and she was loud.

630
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:52,865
And she said "hell." I never
heard her say "hell."

631
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:54,881
I didn't even know she knew
how to say "hell."

632
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,798
She was mad and she yelled
and she said "hell."

633
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:59,530
Yeah, but she called.

634
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:41,538
Keep those fans going. I don't want the
whole house to smell of raw fish.

635
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,973
Disgusting food.

636
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:45,680
Shelby, Martin,
how wonderful that you've come.

637
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:47,346
We're a bit early, I'm afraid.

638
00:27:47,408 --> 00:27:49,786
Nonsense. Have a Rory. We'll chat later.

639
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,555
Tacky, horrid people. Why not just show up
the night before with a sleeping bag?

640
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,184
My, my,
you've got to get it down to a 1-bell answer.

641
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,845
Bell rings once, door opens.

642
00:27:57,903 --> 00:27:58,937
Please help me on this.

643
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:01,906
Mr. Gilmore is not here yet,
and therefore I have no one

644
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:03,521
to help me with the guests or the party.

645
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,981
So, just make sure you get
the door after one bell.

646
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:07,289
That's two bells.

647
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,610
That's three bells!

648
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:12,456
Well, hello, Glory. Come in, come in.

649
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:16,142
Rory, you look wonderful.

650
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:18,095
That dress is to die for.

651
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:21,837
Well, it's the one you laid out on the bed,
so I assumed I was supposed to put it on.

652
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,976
Well, it's perfect.

653
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:24,745
So, how does it look?

654
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:25,635
Fine.

655
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:28,041
I'll never forgive myself for
being talked into votives,

656
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,938
but that's what you get for taking
calls at cocktail hour.

657
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:32,086
Have you tried your drink?

658
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:32,964
My what?

659
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:34,530
Your signature drink.

660
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,386
I had the bartender concoct it for you.
It's called "the Rory."

661
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:41,200
It's got champagne, vodka, pineapple juice,
and grenadine.

662
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:42,739
Have one. You're old enough now.

663
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,614
Maybe later-- empty stomach.

664
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,799
Well, there's plenty to eat,
so that can be remedied.

665
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:47,927
Where's grandpa?

666
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,362
He'll be here soon.

667
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:52,562
There they are-- the two most
lovely ladies in the room.

668
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,669
Hello, Logan.

669
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,540
I have to check on your cake.

670
00:28:57,223 --> 00:28:58,170
Huh.

671
00:28:58,231 --> 00:29:00,217
Is it me or could the penguins
march through here?

672
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:03,402
She's probably mad because she
found out we're having sex.

673
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:04,722
She what?

674
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:06,168
She found out we're having sex.

675
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:07,558
How the hell did she find that out?

676
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:08,602
I told her minister.

677
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,059
But why would you do that?

678
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,145
Because he was going on and on
about my virtue being a gift.

679
00:29:14,227 --> 00:29:17,216
And now you have it, so I'm gonna have
to buy the next guy a sweater.

680
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:18,503
I just wanted him to stop.

681
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:20,220
And all this without a drink in my hand.

682
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:21,635
Come on, let's get you a Rory.

683
00:29:21,697 --> 00:29:23,860
Ohh, dealing with this family is stressful.

684
00:29:23,913 --> 00:29:26,772
Oh, tell me about it.
And once you've had that drink,

685
00:29:26,838 --> 00:29:28,920
I can tell you how I've been
moved out of the pool house

686
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,115
and into a room right next
to my grandparents.

687
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:34,534
So from now on, we'll have to have
sex in our invisible suits.

688
00:29:34,754 --> 00:29:35,974
Two Rories, please.

689
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,251
Does your grandfather know, also?

690
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:37,974
Oh, yeah.

691
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,861
Make it four.

692
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:39,830
Rory!

693
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:40,845
You came!

694
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:43,905
Of course I came.
I wouldn't miss your 21st birthday.

695
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:46,628
Oh, I'm glad. Hey, Zach, thanks for coming.

696
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,648
Sure, no problem. There's food, right?

697
00:29:48,697 --> 00:29:50,636
Oh, plenty of food.
Lane, I want you to meet Logan.

698
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:52,558
Logan, this is my best friend, Lane.

699
00:29:52,676 --> 00:29:54,195
Hey, nice to finally meet you.

700
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,379
Nice to finally meet you, too.

701
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:59,562
And this is my boyfriend, Zach.

702
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:00,244
How you doing?

703
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:00,901
What?

704
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,654
Oh, I'm hanging in there.

705
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:03,606
You guys want a drink?

706
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:06,099
Well, I'm not sharing, so make it two drinks.

707
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,472
Wow, this house is amazing.
I've never been here before.

708
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:09,172
I'll give you a tour.

709
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,460
Two Rories-- extra cherries for the lady.

710
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:13,317
Oh, my god, you have your own drink.

711
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:16,095
Wait till you see the bathroom.
The guest soap has my face on it.

712
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:18,022
So, you're, like, rich, huh?

713
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:23,479
This might be my least favorite
door in the world to knock on.

714
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,478
What about death's door?

715
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,190
The reception on the other
side might be warmer.

716
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,036
Well, at least you didn't have to knock.

717
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:31,644
- Ready?
- I was born ready.

718
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:35,085
Ah, nice, low-key affair.

719
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:40,164
Okay, we're in and the gift's on
the gift pile and, um, oh, yes.

720
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:41,066
Cheers.

721
00:30:41,427 --> 00:30:43,738
Okay, there. Checking things off the list.

722
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,927
We should probably move deeper
into the house now.

723
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:46,818
What is this?

724
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:47,671
Do you see Rory?

725
00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:48,680
Not yet.

726
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:49,823
Boy, big turnout.

727
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:52,392
Maybe if we're lucky and we keep
moving around, we can avoid--

728
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:55,591
Lorelai, you came.

729
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:56,806
You're here.

730
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:58,928
There's a chocolate box
for you in the hallway.

731
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,783
Thank you, mom.

732
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:00,517
Hello, Luke.

733
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:02,978
I didn't know you were coming,
I don't have a chocolate box for you.

734
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:04,306
You'll have to share with Lorelai.

735
00:31:04,374 --> 00:31:05,532
Fat chance.

736
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:06,812
Mom buys really good chocolate.

737
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:08,018
I see you have a Rory.

738
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,801
Excuse me?

739
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,546
Your drink-- it's called a Rory.

740
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:12,546
What's the matter, Luke,
you don't like your Rory?

741
00:31:12,628 --> 00:31:14,411
Oh, no, it's great.

742
00:31:14,627 --> 00:31:15,989
It's a little pink, you know.

743
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:17,841
Well, Rory's a girl. Girls like pink.

744
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:19,220
I know. I was just saying.

745
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:21,018
No one's asking you to wear it.
It's not a skirt.

746
00:31:21,074 --> 00:31:23,013
- I know. Just--
- Drink the drink.

747
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:26,217
Well, nice of you two to come.
I have some things to check on.

748
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,118
We'll catch up later. Excuse me.

749
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:31,821
- Ohh, it tasted pink.
- She's gone.

750
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:35,997
I mean, like, really tasted really pink,
like pink pink. Yech!

751
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:37,520
Come on, let's get something to eat.

752
00:31:37,603 --> 00:31:40,627
God, that's terrible.
It's like drinking a "My little pony."

753
00:31:47,232 --> 00:31:48,759
Hey, I'm glad you guys came.

754
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,928
We had to stop and eat first in
case the food here sucked.

755
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:51,995
Happy birthday, Rory.

756
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,880
Yeah, listen, we have really big news.

757
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,082
Thanks, Doyle. What Paris?

758
00:31:55,218 --> 00:31:56,271
- You tell her.
- Okay.

759
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:57,720
But do it fast and don't embellish.

760
00:31:57,786 --> 00:31:59,932
As you know, I'm a senior,
and my reign as editor

761
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:03,324
of the Yale Daily News is officially up at
the end of the year and I'm stepping down.

762
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:05,108
I'm going back to writing full-time.

763
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:05,717
Wow.

764
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:09,260
I'm gonna be writing a column in the Daily
News called "The world according to Doyle."

765
00:32:09,331 --> 00:32:11,710
I can't imagine the Daily News
without you as editor.

766
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,551
Yeah, it's going to be weird.

767
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:14,847
Ask who the new editor is.

768
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:16,401
Who's the new editor going to be?

769
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,360
Me.

770
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,277
- You?
- That's right.

771
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,066
Paris Geller is the new editor
of the Yale Daily News.

772
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:25,317
I was worried about the intimidation factor
'cause people tend to be afraid of me,

773
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:28,926
but I campaigned hard and I really worked
the "my parents left me broke" angle,

774
00:32:28,986 --> 00:32:31,976
got a little sympathy vote,
and the next thing I know, I am the man.

775
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,417
My woman is the man.

776
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:34,688
I mean, it's so incredible.

777
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,406
Last year, I was sleeping with the editor.

778
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:37,929
And this year, I am.

779
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,097
I can't wait.

780
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:40,368
The changes I'm going to make.

781
00:32:40,454 --> 00:32:41,798
Hold on to your hats, people.

782
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,033
I'm going to crack that whip, raise that bar.

783
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:47,827
The last person that ran the shop was
too busy ironing his petticoat
to put out a decent paper.

784
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:49,493
- That's about to change.
- You know it is.

785
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:51,390
Hey, everyone. Hey, Paris.

786
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,206
Hey, Lorelai.
You remember my boyfriend, Doyle?

787
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:54,548
Good to see you. This is Luke.

788
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:55,604
Nice to meet you, Luke.

789
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,404
We actually met about two or three w--

790
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,249
- This is my boyfriend, Doyle.
- It's nice to meet you.

791
00:32:59,315 --> 00:33:00,886
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too.

792
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:02,669
Hey, birthday girl.

793
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:03,398
Hey.

794
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:04,792
We were just talking about the big news.

795
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:05,826
What's the big news?

796
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:08,113
I'm the new editor of the Yale Daily News.

797
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:10,876
Wow. Congratulations, Paris.

798
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:13,089
Yeah.
Last year I was sleeping with the editor.

799
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:14,614
And this year, I am.

800
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:19,290
Um... I have to go say hello to some people,
so I'll catch up with you guys later.

801
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:21,355
Have some food. There's tons of food.

802
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:29,224
You know, they shouldn't be allowed to put
just anything into a martini glass.

803
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,531
Martinis should go into a martini glass--

804
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,981
gin martinis, vodka martinis, period.
That's it.

805
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:34,977
Do you know what this is?

806
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:37,877
It's raw fish. Dip it in soy sauce
and swallow it real quick.

807
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,585
We were gonna drink martinis.

808
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:42,765
The rat pack drank martinis.
James Bond drank martinis.

809
00:33:42,836 --> 00:33:44,890
You know,
it's the sweet drinks that really kill you.

810
00:33:44,951 --> 00:33:47,398
It's the sugar that gives you the
hangover that makes you throw up.

811
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:50,427
'Cause no one's ever thrown
up from a martini before.

812
00:33:50,573 --> 00:33:51,807
Have you seen my father?

813
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:52,765
Nope.

814
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:54,257
Wonder where he's hiding.

815
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,288
Okay, I got the red piece down.

816
00:33:57,365 --> 00:33:59,480
"Hello, 'page six'?
Have I got a scoop for you."

817
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:02,444
- Excuse me, Lorelai?
- Uh, yeah?

818
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:05,792
Hi, I'm Vivian Lewis,
and this is Catherine Thurston Moore.

819
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:07,986
We're friends of Rory's from the DAR

820
00:34:08,055 --> 00:34:09,673
Oh, friends of Rory's.

821
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,539
Wow.
I didn't realize she ran with the bad girls.

822
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:16,323
We just wanted to tell you we love Rory.

823
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:20,296
She introduced us to Buffalo
Wings and JalapeÃ±o Poppers,

824
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,992
and for that we will be eternally grateful.

825
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,229
What's the DAR?

826
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:29,446
I'm gonna get a beer. Anyone want anything?

827
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,241
- I'm good.
- Okay, I'll be back.

828
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:34,046
Last year I was sleeping with the editor.

829
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:36,404
Now I am.

830
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:39,494
Come in a little quicker next time.

831
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:42,894
Oh, excuse me.

832
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:47,985
Hey, little tip-- we have beer here.

833
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:50,454
Oh, the magic words.
I was just heading over to the bar.

834
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:51,681
Have you tried a Rory yet?

835
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:54,101
Yes, I have. Not my kind of drink.

836
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,238
Yeah, mine, either.

837
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,080
Lorelai will be glad to hear it.

838
00:34:57,905 --> 00:34:59,628
So, you two haven't talked yet.

839
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:00,570
Nope, not yet.

840
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:03,218
Well, it was nice of you to invite her here.
It means a lot.

841
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm glad she came. I'm glad you both came.

842
00:35:06,046 --> 00:35:09,475
Oh, uh, here. I've got something for you.

843
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:11,023
Birthday present.

844
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:11,726
Really?

845
00:35:11,797 --> 00:35:14,038
I brought it in case your mother
didn't bring one, but she did.

846
00:35:14,134 --> 00:35:16,703
It's on top of your present
mountain over there.

847
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:19,257
But since I already had it in my pocket,
I just figured...

848
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:20,871
Luke.

849
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,428
It was my mother's.

850
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:27,090
Liz can't wear it 'cause her neck's too fat,
but your neck looks, you know, not fat.

851
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,582
It was sitting around in my drawer,
so I thought, "hey, give it to Rory."

852
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:34,410
You're lucky 'cause Ceaser's birthday is next
month and I know he likes pearls, so...

853
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,031
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

854
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,178
I saw a jewelry box and I couldn't
help myself. What did you get?

855
00:35:41,364 --> 00:35:43,547
Oh, it's fantastic.

856
00:35:43,612 --> 00:35:45,618
It's from Luke, my stepfather-to-be.

857
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,715
Well, you have exquisite taste, Luke.
I'm Tweeny Halpern.

858
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:50,118
Tweeny works with me at the DAR.

859
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,807
What's the DAR?

860
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:55,712
I'm killing with that line tonight.

861
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:01,655
Well, how's the party going so far?

862
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,161
Seems to be a big hit.

863
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:05,412
Where's Luke?
I hope he didn't get lost somewhere.

864
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,933
Oh, no, I'm sure he's just sizing up how much
silver he can stuff into his pockets

865
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:10,410
without it making too much of a bulge.

866
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:12,598
I was not insinuating that he was a thief.

867
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:13,398
Ah.

868
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,173
I was just making small, polite talk.
That's what you do at parties.

869
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:18,889
My commenting on his getting
lost was in no way a swipe.

870
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:22,370
I'm sorry, I forgot. Luke went to get a beer.
Take it.

871
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,830
Come on, mom, it's all about timing.
You know that.

872
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:26,933
What are you--

873
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:31,384
Well, it seems congratulations are in order.

874
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:35,664
Well, that wasn't exactly congratulations,
but, sure, close enough.

875
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:38,068
Excuse me, Mrs. Gilmore, but we
really should cut the cake now.

876
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,688
Have you seen Mr. Gilmore yet?

877
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,579
No, I haven't.

878
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,625
Of course not. He's going to sit all
night long in that office of his,

879
00:36:43,728 --> 00:36:46,056
moping and sulking,
missing his granddaughter's birthday party,

880
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:47,988
and he's going to leave me out
here all alone to host it.

881
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:48,798
Fine.

882
00:36:48,863 --> 00:36:49,875
Come on, Claire.

883
00:37:00,763 --> 00:37:02,241
Hello? Dad?

884
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,726
You're missing a crazy party out there.

885
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:09,062
You know someone forgot to cook the fish?
Boy, is mom gonna be mad.

886
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:10,279
Go away, Lorelai.

887
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:11,652
What's wrong, dad?

888
00:37:11,878 --> 00:37:13,359
You know what's wrong.

889
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:16,538
Rory's wrong. It's all wrong.

890
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:20,953
She's not going back to Yale.

891
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,003
It's my fault.

892
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:23,505
Rory made a choice, dad.

893
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:25,013
I could've stopped her, and I didn't.

894
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:29,026
I cleared the path for her to walk
away from her goal, her life.

895
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:31,159
- Dad--
- She's having sex, Lorelai.

896
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,399
She's having sex under my roof.

897
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:36,655
I paid $40,000 to redecorate her sex house.

898
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:40,679
I bought her her sex mattress,
her sex box springs.

899
00:37:40,776 --> 00:37:43,564
I provided everything she
needs to waste her life.

900
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:46,335
Dad, Rory having sex is
not your fault, really.

901
00:37:46,395 --> 00:37:48,885
She was having sex way before
the big renovation.

902
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:50,537
I feel so much better now.

903
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:52,022
I'm sorry. I-I wasn't trying to--

904
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,233
I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

905
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,817
No, dad, listen--

906
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,098
Richard, you come out of here right now
and make an appearance at this party.

907
00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:00,935
I don't give a damn about the party, Emily.

908
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:02,098
What is going on with you?

909
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:04,121
You've been holed up in here for two days.
Is it work?

910
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:05,265
It's Rory.

911
00:38:05,322 --> 00:38:06,250
What about Rory?

912
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,265
What do you mean, "what about Rory"?

913
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:09,777
We've lost her.

914
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:12,279
What are you talking about?
I got her out of the pool house.

915
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:15,940
For a day, for two days,
and then those rentals go back.

916
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:18,815
Fine, then I'll have the place fumigated.
That'll take a week.

917
00:38:18,904 --> 00:38:21,578
Then I'll have the place checked for mold.
That'll be two weeks.

918
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:24,384
Then I'll find rats.
Then there will be carbon monoxide leaks,

919
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:27,310
and plumbing issues and if I have to,
I'll tear the damn place down.

920
00:38:27,413 --> 00:38:29,730
In the meantime,
she's here where we can watch her.

921
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:31,201
That doesn't matter, Emily.

922
00:38:31,272 --> 00:38:32,898
- We have lost her.
- No!

923
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,374
- We've failed.
- No, we have not failed.

924
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:38,463
We have not failed until that girl comes
home pregnant. Then we've failed.

925
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:39,866
And on that note...

926
00:38:41,368 --> 00:38:43,937
Richard, I don't understand what's happening.

927
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:46,552
Everything's been fine except the sex issue.

928
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:48,812
Everything hasn't been fine.

929
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:52,333
The minute we went against Lorelai, we lost.

930
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:54,394
You're acting like this is my fault.

931
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:56,420
Going against Lorelai was your idea.

932
00:38:56,497 --> 00:39:00,100
I was perfectly ready to go ahead with
the plan the three of us devised.

933
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,474
Running around with Logan,
joining the DAR, planning parties.

934
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:07,268
What's wrong with joining the DAR?
We both agreed she needed a job.

935
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:08,989
Fund-raisers and tea parties?

936
00:39:09,051 --> 00:39:11,189
It's frivolous and meaningless.

937
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:15,526
She has more to do, more to be.
I don't want that life for her.

938
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:17,340
You mean my life.

939
00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:19,010
You don't want her to be me.

940
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:21,160
Emily, no, that's not what I meant.

941
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,344
We're cutting the cake now.
Can't wait anymore.

942
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,061
So.

943
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:44,190
So.

944
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:47,832
Your drink is disgusting.

945
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:49,019
Tell me about it.

946
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,997
Nice party, though.

947
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,473
Yeah, it's very nice.

948
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:52,981
You look great.

949
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:54,073
You look skinny.

950
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:56,575
Oh, well, it's the construction diet.

951
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:57,627
Construction?

952
00:39:57,924 --> 00:39:59,938
Yeah, we're making the bedroom bigger.

953
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,030
You and Luke?

954
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:04,496
No, me and John O'Hurley.
Luke doesn't know yet.
I hope he takes it okay.

955
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:06,039
You guys are gonna live at our house?

956
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:06,935
Yeah.

957
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,834
Wow.

958
00:40:07,996 --> 00:40:08,930
That's nice.

959
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:11,786
So, what's new with you?

960
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:14,281
Oh, well, not much.

961
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:18,363
I got my community service hours
down from 300 to 104.

962
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:22,232
God, community should be well-served by now.

963
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:24,165
They should build a statue
of you when you're done.

964
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:26,246
Well, it's not just one community.

965
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:28,668
Right, yeah. That makes more sense, I guess.

966
00:40:29,815 --> 00:40:30,978
I got a dog.

967
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:32,527
- What?
- Stop. He's fine.

968
00:40:32,594 --> 00:40:33,292
He's alive?

969
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:35,854
Yes, he's alive,
and I'm not discussing that hamster again.

970
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:38,152
But you asked Babette to double-check
that you feed it in the morning?

971
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:40,428
That is so not necessary... and yes.

972
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:41,929
Wow, a dog.

973
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:44,226
A lot has changed.

974
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:47,769
A lot, and then not so much, also.

975
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,383
Did you get your chocolate box?
They're by the door.

976
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:53,972
No, I didn't. I'll get one on the way out.

977
00:40:54,187 --> 00:40:55,185
They're good.

978
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,356
I ate two.

979
00:40:58,853 --> 00:41:00,892
It's a really pretty party.

980
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:02,959
I actually like all the votives and the--

981
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:06,322
Happy birthday to you

982
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:10,383
Happy birthday to you

983
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:15,467
Happy birthday, dear Rory

984
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:19,963
Happy birthday to you

985
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,510
Ready to go?

986
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:29,437
Sure.

987
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:38,921
Hey.

988
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:42,920
You can pull link sausages
out of me if you want.
