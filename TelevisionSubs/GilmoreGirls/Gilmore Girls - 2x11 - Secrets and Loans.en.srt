1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,421
- The time?
- 4:30.

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,256
- Fill me up.
- That's your sixth cup.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,758
- Yes, it is.
- How about some tea?

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,552
Absolutely. Throw it in with the coffee.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,347
- I assume Rory's meeting you here?
- Yes, she is.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,642
She's late. I have to go to class tonight,
so I have 10 more minutes.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,976
- I got it.
- You did?

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,395
- Right here.
- Hurry up, open it.

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,191
- Leave the pot, Ethel.
- I'm just an enabler.

10
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,778
Just remember, these are the PSATs.
It's like the Baby Gap.

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,448
They don't count as much. You can
take them again. Plus, you are young.

12
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,244
You have years of learning ahead.
The important thing is that you tried hard.

13
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,038
I got a 740 Verbal and a 760 Math.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,417
- Thank God you're not an idiot.
- I got a 740 Verbal and a 760 Math?

15
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,879
Those are damn good scores,
little lady, really. Amazing. Top-notch.

16
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,841
Those are PSA-Terrific.

17
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,884
Sorry, I had to go for it. You're frowning.

18
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,470
- How did I get a higher score in Math?
- Who cares?

19
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,099
- I'm stronger in Verbal. Verbal is my thing.
- No, VerbaI's my thing.

20
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,102
Maybe I didn't study hard enough.
Maybe I got cocky.

21
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,647
Maybe you need
a mud bath-salt glow-chill pill combo.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,733
- I'm just saying...
- You got a great score.

23
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,403
- Yeah, but...
- No. A great score.

24
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,487
Great score?

25
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,865
That is a score you have earned
and you deserve...

26
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,285
and will allow you to look down at me
for many years to come.

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,204
We should celebrate.
Let's get all dressed up tonight...

28
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,415
- and hit The Rocky Horror Picture Show?
- Serious?

29
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,250
- I'm always serious.
- Can I invite Lane?

30
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,459
Absolutely.

31
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,588
I hope she gets this in time.
She's been hard to reach lately.

32
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,258
Maybe she can't handle the pressure
of having such a brilliant best friend.

33
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,219
- Brilliant in Math. The VerbaI's kind of sad.
- Thank you.

34
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,847
- You're late.
- Shoot. I am. I have to go.

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,974
Rory kicked some major PSAT ass today.

36
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,185
- Yeah? Congratulations.
- Thank you.

37
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,979
We're gonna hit
The Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight.

38
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,898
- Really?
- Yes, I am Magenta.

39
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,900
Rory opts for Janet. I had a thought.

40
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,319
- Yeah?
- I was thinking that you could put on...

41
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,280
fishnet stockings, a leather teddy,
platform boots, and come...

42
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,574
- as Dr. Frank-N-Furter.
- That is a thought.

43
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,619
- You'll also need some gloves and a wig.
- Gloves, wigs. Got it.

44
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,204
- I'll do your makeup.
- That'll help.

45
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,914
- There you go.
- Sounds great.

46
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,791
- 8:00, I'll swing around and get you?
- Sure, good.

47
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,669
If by some chance you knock on the door
but no one answers...

48
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,422
even if the lights are on,
I'll meet you there.

49
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:14,218
- So I'll see you tomorrow morning?
- I'll be the one with the coffee.

50
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,681
Make sure you gloat a little.
It's good for the skin.

51
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,493
Rory!

52
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,663
Do you think the porch is falling apart,
or do you weigh a ton?

53
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,875
The porch is fine.
It has a little extra ventilation in it now.

54
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,711
- The wood is old and rotting.
- It is not old and rotting.

55
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,465
It is strong and sprightly and will be
with us for a long time to come.

56
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,925
So you do weigh a ton?

57
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,469
- I checked under the entire house.
- And?

58
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,304
- You have termites.
- What?

59
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,849
Tens of thousands of them.
Subterranean, drywood, the whole gamut.

60
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,976
- Gross.
- Four crawled up my nose.

61
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,395
It happens all the time
when you're upside down.

62
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,732
To them, the nostril looks like
another hollow passage in the wood.

63
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,860
- They're not too bright.
- Okay, so we have termites.

64
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,446
What do we...
Don't you want to come inside, Kirk?

65
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,282
Actually, I would prefer
to discuss this outside.

66
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,204
Let's get down to it.

67
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,457
From what I witnessed,
your house is a bug-infested smorgasbord.

68
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,625
Are those for me?

69
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,919
- Yeah.
- What do we do?

70
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,048
- I'd prefer to discuss this on the lawn.
- Why?

71
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,759
This porch could give out on us
at any minute.

72
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,928
Kirk, that's crazy.

73
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,973
- Stop. The porch is fine.
- Your foot went through it today.

74
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,184
- That was different. That wood was old.
- What happened to sprightly?

75
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,978
Kirk, what are you doing?

76
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,399
Making sure that if the roof comes down,
the debris can't ricochet and take me out.

77
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:19,403
In five more minutes, you won't need to.
Please talk to me about the termites.

78
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,905
- What do I do, tent the place?
- To start with, yes.

79
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,198
- To start with?
- What?

80
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,827
They've done some serious damage.
They've eaten through the wooden joists.

81
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,538
Your foundation has lost
its structural integrity.

82
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,081
Our house is falling down.

83
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,168
- What should I do to fix this?
- You have to jack the house up...

84
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,421
rebuild the joists, and repair
the weakened parts of the foundation.

85
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,799
- All for the low price of...
- I haven't done the exact estimate.

86
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,635
I'd say somewhere in the neighborhood
of $15,000.

87
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,431
- Tell it to move to another neighborhood.
- Sorry?

88
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,725
- $15,000?
- We're never eating again.

89
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:53,061
I don't have $15,000.
I've never had $15,000.

90
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,314
I'm trying to picture $15,000, I can't.

91
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,983
That's how unfamiliar
$15,000 and I are with each other.

92
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,485
You can just fix part of the house,
the part you like.

93
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,405
- We like the entire house.
- Really? Even that kitchen?

94
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,781
Thanks for coming over.

95
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,950
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know yet.

96
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,161
You don't want to wait too long
to address this.

97
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,370
I get that.

98
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,748
- You might get the dishes out of there.
- Good tip.

99
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,375
- Thanks for the waffles.
- Thanks for the horrifying news.

100
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,793
Any time.

101
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,507
Look at it this way.
The day's all uphill from here.

102
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,052
- This is really bad.
- Don't worry. We'll figure something out.

103
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,930
- We should get inside.
- Yeah.

104
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,265
After you.

105
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,983
- Eleven, twelve, here.
- Thanks.

106
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,905
- One, two three...
- I'm depressed.

107
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,200
- Jeremy didn't call?
- Not in a timely manner, no.

108
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,203
- Good riddance to bad luggage.
- I guess.

109
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,873
I thought we really connected
the other day in the supply closet.

110
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,376
Boys. A Nancy Drew mystery.

111
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,546
- Louise. Madeline.
- You look happy.

112
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,172
Really?

113
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,217
- What?
- Nothing.

114
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,554
It's just a nice day. A nice, nice day.

115
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,391
- Okay.
- Did you get your PSAT scores back yet?

116
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,601
- Yeah. Yesterday.
- And?

117
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,229
- 500 Verbal, 560 Math.
- Respectable.

118
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,356
- I thought so.
- Louise, what did you get?

119
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,568
- Highlights, around my face.
- You'll take them again and do better.

120
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:27,072
- I'll do that and get my nose done.
- You don't study. You don't apply yourself.

121
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,616
- I need another chip.
- Take them.

122
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,202
- So I got my scores back today, too.
- Yeah?

123
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:36,832
This morning. I came downstairs,
and there they were, sitting on the table.

124
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,879
Boy, was I nervous,
just imagining what I got.

125
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,884
Then I realized that I'd have to
open them eventually, and so I did.

126
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,595
Was I surprised by what I found.

127
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,348
Could've knocked me over with a feather.

128
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,768
Yep. I was just that surprised.

129
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,105
So, what did you get?

130
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:04,318
Rory, since you asked, and by the way,
I'm not bragging or anything...

131
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,321
but I got a 750 Math and a 730 Verbal.

132
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,531
- That is good.
- Congratulations.

133
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,742
- Thank you.
- Those are great scores.

134
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,953
- Did you get your scores back yet?
- Yep.

135
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,414
- And?
- I'm happy.

136
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,124
- How happy?
- Pretty happy.

137
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,418
How do I know you're not
one of those people...

138
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,462
who gets pretty happy
looking at a sunset?

139
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,006
How do I know what your barometer
for pretty happy is?

140
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,799
- You don't.
- Right.

141
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,137
- So, are you?
- Am I what?

142
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,890
Are you one of those who gets happy
looking at a sunset?

143
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,060
- I don't get unhappy looking at a sunset.
- What did you get?

144
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,187
- That's personal.
- Why won't you tell me?

145
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,397
'Cause it's none of your business.

146
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,985
- Okay, fine. Don't tell me what you got.
- I won't.

147
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,613
Why won't you tell me your score?

148
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,948
Bye, Paris.

149
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,242
You're not torturing me, you know.
I don't care!

150
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,411
My scores were great.
I'm very happy with my scores.

151
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:00,791
And I hate looking at a sunset,
so my standard for happiness is high!

152
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,971
- Rory, wake up.
- What's going on?

153
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,889
- I can hear them chewing.
- Who?

154
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:19,643
The termites. They're everywhere,
nibbling and eating and swallowing.

155
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,728
- You're insane.
- I can't sleep here.

156
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,772
- What?
- We have to go to Sookie's.

157
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,440
You're kidding, right?

158
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,110
It's 11:00 p. m.

159
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,238
Well, here. But somewhere
in the world, it's still Miller time.

160
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,491
Mom, you're wigging.
Go put on some imaginary earplugs...

161
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,661
to drown out the imaginary
termite sounds and go back to sleep.

162
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,454
- But...
- Bed. Now.

163
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,458
- You really don't hear them?
- No.

164
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,211
And as soon as you're asleep,
you won't, either.

165
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,882
- Okay, fine. Good night.
- Good night.

166
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,810
- I feel like they're crawling all over me.
- I know.

167
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,104
With their creepy little fangy teeth...

168
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,440
their tail things and their pointy tentacles.

169
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,358
You have no idea
what a termite looks like.

170
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,695
Unless they're wearing a foundation
repair guy T-shirt, I don't care.

171
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,906
- You sure Sookie was up?
- She answered the phone.

172
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,575
- After how many rings?
- I don't know, 20 or 30.

173
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,703
- Mom, she was sleeping.
- No. She's just deaf in one ear.

174
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,413
- Since when?
- Now, apparently.

175
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:22,498
What?

176
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:27,377
You would have to be deaf in one ear
not to hear the phone ring 20 or 30 times.

177
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,423
There they are,
my little termite whisperers.

178
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,967
- Sookie, sorry to call so late.
- And so incessantly.

179
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,012
They were getting organized.
I heard one of them yell, 'Charge!'

180
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,515
- We will make this up to you.
- What are you saying?

181
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,267
- This is great. It's like a slumber party.
- You sure?

182
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:47,272
Absolutely. We can raid the fridge, we can
make a nice avocado-mango facemask.

183
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,817
Get out the tarot cards, tell fortunes,
play Twister...

184
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:54,071
make a Haagen-Dazs chocolate
chocolate chip ice cream milkshake.

185
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,907
- We'll watch Purple Rain.
- Sookie, it's midnight.

186
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,993
- Let's go straight for the milkshakes.
- Good thinking.

187
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,246
I'll put my stuff in the guest room.

188
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,707
Sookie, I really appreciate you letting us
crash here tonight.

189
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,293
So creepy, just lying there...

190
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:12,422
listening to a thousand tiny little insects
just mocking me.

191
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,050
'Ha, ha! We're eating your house.
Try and stop us. '

192
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,261
- When are you going to tent?
- Next week.

193
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,345
That sucks.

194
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,139
- $2,000.
- That sucks.

195
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,268
And after the $2,000 circus-tent fiasco...

196
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:28,063
I have to find another $15,000
to keep my house from falling down.

197
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,899
- I like that house.
- I know you do.

198
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,151
- I don't want it to fall down.
- I know you don't.

199
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,655
- Anyway, I called the bank today.
- How did that go?

200
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,283
Well, wait, what's that?

201
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,159
- They're still laughing.
- What?

202
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,329
They passed the phone around,
made me ask everyone in the place.

203
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,666
That is terrible. Completely heartless.

204
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,544
According to the jolly bankers,
I'm worth nothing.

205
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,838
There so has to be something you can do.

206
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,841
I was thinking about opening
a Coyote Ugly lemonade stand.

207
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,093
- Interesting.
- What's interesting?

208
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:02,723
Nothing. Your mom is apparently
one of the biggest losers in Stars Hollow.

209
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,517
- Okay. Continue.
- You should call them again tomorrow.

210
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,145
- No, Sookie.
- No, I mean it.

211
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:11,398
You're an upstanding citizen,
an active part of the community.

212
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,110
You made all of the donkey outfits
for the Christmas festival last year.

213
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,654
You organized the 'Save the Historic
Oak Tree' campaign.

214
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:21,533
You played Tevye in the Stars Hollow
Community theater production...

215
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,285
- of Fiddler on the Roof.
- Yes.

216
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:27,039
Five and a half stars from the
Stars Hollow Gazette. Unheard of till then.

217
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,541
- They should take that into account.
- Yes, they should.

218
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,668
Yes, they should, but they won't.

219
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:39,176
I bet there's a room at the inn
you could stay in, part-time at least.

220
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,886
- What was that?
- What?

221
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,055
- That noise.
- What noise?

222
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,933
A huge thud just came from your closet.

223
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,352
Yeah, that's my shoes.

224
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,063
- Your shoes?
- Yeah. That's my shoe closet.

225
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,401
Sometimes I don't stack them properly,
and then they fall...

226
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,906
and then there's the thudding sound.
And then... No.

227
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,076
That's probably the sound
that you just heard.

228
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,995
- The ice cream's getting melted.
- Jackson?

229
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,747
- Yes.
- How you doing?

230
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,499
I'm doing fine. You?

231
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,752
- Sookie, Jackson's hiding in the closet.
- Yes, he is.

232
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,380
- Why didn't you say something?
- Because you were upset...

233
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,008
you were bringing Rory, I didn't want her
to feel weird or uncomfortable.

234
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,427
- So you stuck Jackson in the closet?
- She did.

235
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,763
- Jackson, come out.
- I'm in my pajamas.

236
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,391
- So are we.
- Yeah, but mine are humiliating.

237
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,685
- We won't laugh.
- Yes, you will.

238
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,687
- I promise we won't.
- I'm fine.

239
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,773
Will you be fine there all night?
'Cause we're staying all night.

240
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,025
Knowing Sookie,
she'll make a big breakfast.

241
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,611
So tonight will last
until late tomorrow morning.

242
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,447
So the bottom line for you here
is you'll be holed up...

243
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,950
in that closet a very, very long time.

244
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,412
If I come out,
you have to understand one thing.

245
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,373
I have a cousin who owns
a Xerox company that specializes...

246
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:55,127
in taking pictures and making them
into things: Calendars, coffee mugs...

247
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,381
- collector plates, and pajamas.
- Jackson's wearing picture pajamas?

248
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,924
- Yes, he is.
- Does he do this often?

249
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,093
- Almost every night.
- What are the pictures of?

250
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,889
Him. During high school,
in his wrestling uniform.

251
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,641
- You have to come out here right now.
- No.

252
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,894
- Why?
- Because you sound too eager.

253
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,063
- I'm not. Am I eager?
- Put your paws down.

254
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:19,651
I'm not eager. I just want you to come out
and be comfortable, that's all.

255
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,528
Well, okay.

256
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:30,996
Honey, we're making milkshakes.
You want to come in and help?

257
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,122
Okay.

258
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,836
If our house does fall down and we end up
living in a hollowed-out tree...

259
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,672
this moment might make it all worth it.

260
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,845
- Hello, Lane?
- What are you doing here?

261
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,431
- Mrs. Kim, hi. I was just...
- Out!

262
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,058
- What?
- Out!

263
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,977
- But I wiped off my feet.
- Move.

264
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,606
I was just looking for Lane,
and I thought she was...

265
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,484
- Taylor says you have termites.
- I don't, my house does.

266
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,529
- You are a carrier.
- I don't think you can be a termite carrier.

267
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,615
- You spread it all over town.
- We don't control the termites.

268
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,868
- They move on their own.
- See all the furniture in there? Wood.

269
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,996
All wood. You must go. Go now!

270
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,710
- Can you just tell me if Lane is home?
- No.

271
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,546
- Do you know where she is?
- School.

272
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,549
- Still?
- Yes. She's there, she's studying.

273
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,052
What's that moving by your foot?
I see something moving.

274
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,887
There's nothing. I swear.

275
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,890
Will you tell her I came by?

276
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,310
Then she chased me
halfway down the street with a hose.

277
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:39,106
- It was like a scene from Silkwood.
- News travels way too fast around here.

278
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,066
Four people asked me
when we were tenting...

279
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,111
two asked if we were moving,
one asked me if we were atheists.

280
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,280
We have to stop talking to people.

281
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,949
We have to stay at home
with the curtains drawn...

282
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:53,537
collecting old newspapers, muttering,
and eating Cup-a-Soup and Slim Jims.

283
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,205
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Madeline.

284
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,375
- Hi.
- Listen, I have to ask you a little favor.

285
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm working on an article for The Franklin.
Totally last minute.

286
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,507
I thought it would be
interesting to compare...

287
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:09,136
Chilton's overall PSAT scores
to other prep schools in the area.

288
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,181
I'm trying to compile
a list of people's scores...

289
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:16,059
especially the top students,
and I realized I don't have yours yet.

290
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,438
- You want to know my PSAT scores?
- That would be great.

291
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,565
- Put Paris on the phone.
- Excuse me?

292
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,610
- Let me talk to her.
- Paris isn't here.

293
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,863
I don't know where she is.
She's probably at her house...

294
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,116
or maybe at the library,
or maybe she's buying pencils...

295
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,745
because she goes through them so fast,
she pushes down on them really hard.

296
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,663
- Then they break...
- Madeline.

297
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,040
Hold on.

298
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,293
- What?
- Pathetic.

299
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,003
- Why won't you tell me?
- Bye, Paris.

300
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,589
Tell me those scores. I have to know.
Rory?

301
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,385
- Paris again?
- Yep.

302
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,973
If we put Paris and my mother in a room
together, the world would implode.

303
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,601
I'll keep that in mind
for the next science fair.

304
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,894
Enough.

305
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,647
I've got computer screens
feeling sorry for me.

306
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,190
How many places is that?

307
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,401
It's not the amount of places
that turns you down that matters...

308
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,946
it's the quality of the place
that turns you down.

309
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,823
When you've got Jacko's Loans
not wanting your business...

310
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,451
- it's time to hang out with the Coreys.
- Sorry.

311
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,495
I won't think about it tonight.

312
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,081
I'll think about it tomorrow. At Tara.

313
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,874
- You ready?
- One sec.

314
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,044
Mom, I hate to bring this up...

315
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,463
but there's an obvious solution
to our problem.

316
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:27,840
- I know.
- You do?

317
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:32,344
Yes. Frankly, I think if I sold you
into white slavery, I would miss you.

318
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:36,390
- Please don't go where you're going.
- I think they would say yes.

319
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:40,018
Of course they'd say yes.
And that yes would be followed by:

320
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:44,648
'Okay, enough already. My God,
please, stop. I've got nothing left to give. '

321
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,984
- That's not true.
- That is completely true.

322
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,529
- Grandma and Grandpa will help.
- I went to my parents for you for Chilton.

323
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,532
Why? Because that was worth
all the obligation. This is not.

324
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,993
- This is our home.
- I'll find a way to fix it.

325
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,870
- How?
- I don't know yet.

326
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,372
If you don't know,
then maybe there's not another way.

327
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,458
- There's always another way.
- Was there another way with Chilton?

328
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,586
- That was different.
- Why was that different?

329
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,338
Because I said so.
I'm the one doing the groveling...

330
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,009
and that gets you judgment rights,
and I'm judging that this is different.

331
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,761
- The remaining judge begs to differ.
- I know you mean well.

332
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,222
I'm not gonna deal with my parents
on this one. No.

333
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,975
- You're being stubborn.
- Have I shocked you?

334
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,643
Fine, let's go.

335
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,230
- Where's Grandpa tonight?
- He's at work.

336
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:29,026
Explain to him that quitting means
you don't go back to the job, you quit.

337
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,904
- He did not quit. He resigned.
- Same rules apply.

338
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,741
When you resign, you have to put in
certain time to get things in order.

339
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,494
He has clients to see,
certain accounts to close out.

340
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:41,997
- Is that hard for him?
- Actually, I think he's rather enjoying it.

341
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,501
- Good.
- Yes, it is good. What are you taking?

342
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,252
- Roofies.
- Aspirin.

343
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,254
- Are you sick?
- I have a headache.

344
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,299
That means you're sick. You think
it's normal to have a headache?

345
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,092
I just have a tension headache.

346
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:57,429
- What do you have to be tense about?
- I can't begin to think.

347
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,431
- You should lie down.
- I'm fine.

348
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,475
- You work too hard.
- I don't.

349
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,061
If you didn't, you wouldn't have
a tension headache.

350
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,938
It's not a work tension headache.

351
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,774
- So then you are sick.
- Actually, I am. I'm sick.

352
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,901
- I knew it. What's wrong?
- Consumption...

353
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:14,029
with a touch of the vapors.
I'm going for a leeching tonight.

354
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,199
- She's got a case of exterminatoritis.
- What's that mean?

355
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,992
- Nothing.
- We have termites.

356
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,370
- That's terrible.
- It's not so bad.

357
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,831
- They're eating our whole house.
- They say thank you.

358
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,791
What does that mean?

359
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,627
We found out that we have
all these foundation problems...

360
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,796
and it's gonna be very expensive to fix.

361
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,673
- Mom can't get a loan.
- That is not true.

362
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:36,218
- You were turned down by five banks.
- I made up Jacko's Loans and stuff.

363
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,762
- Fine, four banks.
- Mom. Wait.

364
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,640
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing you a check.

365
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,851
No, you're not. Hold on here.

366
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,644
- How much do you need?
- Nothing.

367
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,772
- Don't be ridiculous. Tell me how much.
- I can handle this.

368
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,149
- It doesn't sound like you can handle it.
- I can.

369
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,903
If you won't tell me, I'll leave
the amount blank, you can fill it in later.

370
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,322
- Mom, stop.
- You took my pen.

371
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,284
I appreciate the thought,
but I don't need your money.

372
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,620
You'd rather have your house fall down
than let your mother help you?

373
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:06,290
The house won't fall down.
Let's not make it a big issue.

374
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,293
Let's sit down, have a drink,
and have dinner, okay?

375
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,504
- All right.
- Thank you.

376
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:17,467
- Are you going to give me back my pen?
- Yeah. After dinner.

377
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,059
Mom, stop it. Talk to me.

378
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,857
It's been two hours
since you've looked in my direction.

379
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,576
- I get it, you're mad.
- I don't want to talk about this right now.

380
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,703
- You were being stubborn.
- Go to bed.

381
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,830
You didn't want to ask for help, so I did.

382
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,875
You remember the conversation we had
before we left home tonight?

383
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,127
- Yes...
- I told you going to my parents...

384
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,670
- was not an option.
- I know.

385
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,758
I told you several times
that asking my parents was not an option.

386
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,677
I made a few quips to lighten
the subject matter...

387
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,721
but I still made my point
pretty damn clear.

388
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,349
Fine. But we have a real problem here.

389
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,226
You think I don't know that?

390
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,229
You think I sit around all day
swapping witticisms...

391
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:14,233
with Robert Benchley at the Algonquin?
No. I am thinking and worrying...

392
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,568
and using the computer,
and I hate using it.

393
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,197
- Which is exactly why I brought this up.
- You had no right to bring it up!

394
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,742
- Why?
- Because I told you not to, that's why.

395
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:26,745
- But...
- No. There will be no 'buts' here.

396
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,248
There's'I'm sorry, Mom,'
there's 'I screwed up, Mom. '

397
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,793
There's'I'll never do it again, Mom,'
but there are no 'buts. '

398
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,086
- But...
- Out!

399
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,088
Go to bed. We're done.

400
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,561
Think fast.

401
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,565
Very good.

402
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:59,069
- You threw a basketball at my head.
- I threw a basketball past your head.

403
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,238
What if I had turned around
when you said that?

404
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,533
Then you might have caught it,
completing the 'think fast' equation.

405
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,827
- I don't catch basketballs.
- Duly noted.

406
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,830
- I don't even like basketballs.
- I'm very sorry.

407
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:14,293
Out of all the sporting balls in the world,
the basketball is my least favorite.

408
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,128
- They're round and hard.
- Rory.

409
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,464
- And they're orange.
- You do realize how insane you sound?

410
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,592
- Yes.
- Just checking.

411
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,720
- I'm sorry. I'm in a horrible mood.
- Hadn't noticed.

412
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,306
- We've had fights before.
- You and me?

413
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:31,185
Me and Mom.
But this one is particularly crazy.

414
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,646
We have a situation here,
and she's being so stubborn.

415
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,732
What?

416
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,401
- What 'what'?
- What was with the 'huh'?

417
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:42,946
- Nothing.
- There was a meaning behind that 'huh. '

418
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:45,407
That was a loaded 'huh,'
that wasn't a normal 'huh. '

419
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:48,702
You meant to say something,
and now you're taking it back.

420
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,997
Don't use that 'huh'
if you're not prepared to defend it.

421
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,082
Why aren't you saying anything?

422
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,127
Because words are
a very dangerous thing right now.

423
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,297
You were saying I'm stubborn
just like my mother.

424
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:04,593
I was saying that in addition to
all of the wonderful, amazing qualities...

425
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:08,847
that the two of you share,
there's possibly, on occasion...

426
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:12,059
a similar tendency to dig your heels in.

427
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,853
- I hate it when we fight.
- I know.

428
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:17,356
- She was so mad.
- You'll make up.

429
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,152
- Want to get a coffee?
- Yeah.

430
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,695
I'll go get my ball.

431
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,084
If it makes you feel better,
a car ran over it.

432
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,294
I need to get coffee. Now.

433
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:46,218
Hi, Mr. Regalski, it's Lorelai Gilmore.
Again. Yes.

434
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,804
Just like the pink bunny with the drum.

435
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:53,725
Anyway, I was wondering if you have had
a chance to reconsider my loan.

436
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,604
No, I think it's Energizer.

437
00:23:58,397 --> 00:23:59,898
I know you said no...

438
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:01,733
but sometimes people say no...

439
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:04,528
and then they wake up one morning
a couple of days later...

440
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,905
and think, 'I shouldn't have
turned down that mom...

441
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:10,951
'with the good job and great credentials
and the references up the wazoo. '

442
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,370
I do like the word 'wazoo. '

443
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,831
I understand. Okay.

444
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:20,586
I'll give you a call in a couple of days then.
Thank you.

445
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,798
Perhaps you are taking
the wrong approach.

446
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:27,593
- Meaning?
- You tried to convince them of your virtue.

447
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:30,596
Perhaps it's time
to offer them a lap dance.

448
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,932
- You didn't!
- I was kidding. Sort of.

449
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,520
I have to do something, and I'm not sure
exactly where to draw the line.

450
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:41,356
In Thailand, women do this trick
with a Ping-Pong ball...

451
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,902
- that is a big crowd pleaser.
- Line drawn. Thank you.

452
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:48,906
Independence Inn. Michel speaking.

453
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,284
Yes. She is right here.

454
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,578
Your mother.

455
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:58,790
I called to tell you
I talked to Miles Hahn today.

456
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,210
That sounds very nice. I'm glad.

457
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,629
- Do you have any idea who Miles Hahn is?
- Not a bit.

458
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,881
He's the president
of the First National bank.

459
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,883
We've been doing business with him
for years.

460
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,052
He's become a very dear friend of ours.

461
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:13,805
- What does that have to do with me?
- I brought up your little dilemma to him.

462
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:14,890
Oh, boy!

463
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,643
He told me if you were in the mood
to talk to him...

464
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:21,980
you could feel free to do so,
on Thursday at 3:15.

465
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:25,984
- You wrangled me a meeting at your bank.
- I asked a friend for advice.

466
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:30,239
- What else did you ask him for, Mom?
- I simply asked a man to talk to you.

467
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:33,283
What you talk about,
or what comes of that talk is up to you.

468
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:36,370
- Thanks, Mom, but I'm fine.
- So you got a loan?

469
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,664
- I got a lead.
- A lead on a loan?

470
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:39,957
- Yes.
- How nice.

471
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:43,210
- If you could just get an actual loan.
- I got to get back to work.

472
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,503
Thursday at 3:15.

473
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:47,881
Tell your friend thank you,
but I'm afraid I won't be able to make it.

474
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:50,634
He'll be there whether you show up or not.
It's up to you.

475
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:53,804
All I did was make an appointment,
Lorelai. That's all.

476
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,556
Great. Bye, Mom.

477
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,359
Hi. Mr. Regalski, please.
It's Lorelai Gilmore.

478
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,904
I just spoke to him five minutes ago.

479
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,242
When do you expect him back
from France?

480
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,872
- I'll call you later.
- Thanks for the coffee.

481
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,456
You're welcome.

482
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,709
- Bye.
- Bye.

483
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,385
That's for me not thinking fast.

484
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,889
- Please never think fast again.
- I'll try my hardest.

485
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,699
- We need to talk.
- Let's talk.

486
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,703
- Nice outfit.
- Thank you.

487
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:02,331
I guess this is why you've been AWOL
the past few weeks.

488
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,415
Pretty much.

489
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:06,418
You just had the urge
to stand on another girI's shoulders?

490
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:07,878
- Don't be like that.
- Like what?

491
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,380
Like you're being.
It makes it impossible to tell you.

492
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,049
- You didn't tell me.
- I know.

493
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,009
- Why?
- Because.

494
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:17,054
Have you thought of being a prosecutor?
You have real potential.

495
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,431
I didn't tell you,
since I knew you'd act like this.

496
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:22,059
No. I'm acting like this
because you didn't tell me.

497
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,729
If I'd come up to you and said,
'I want to become a cheerleader'...

498
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,606
- you would have said...
- Why?

499
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:30,651
- Exactly.
- Exactly what? Lane, this is weird.

500
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,611
We always used to make fun
of cheerleaders.

501
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:35,656
We would rag on Janie Fertman
and hide during pep rallies.

502
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:39,701
And now all of a sudden, you're peppy.

503
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:41,995
- I'm not peppy.
- You look peppy.

504
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:45,332
- You're not around much anymore.
- So this is my fault?

505
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,709
- And you have Dean.
- This is his fault?

506
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:51,547
I don't know why. I just wanted to do it.
I just wanted to try it.

507
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,800
And I don't feel like I should justify
or explain it to you...

508
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,510
- Then don't.
- Fine. I won't.

509
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,303
- Okay.
- All right.

510
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,808
- I forgot my pom.
- Your what?

511
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,977
Two are pompoms. One's a pom.

512
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,566
- How's it look?
- It's dark. Hand me the flashlight.

513
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,819
Why don't you have those hats
with lights on them?

514
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,405
- I flip burgers for a living.
- Right.

515
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,325
- I think I've seen enough.
- How was it?

516
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,369
Was there a termite
housing development under?

517
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,830
Golf courses and condos with rec rooms?

518
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:25,998
It's not too bad.

519
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,167
What do you know?
You flip burgers for a living.

520
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,335
I mean, there's definitely a little damage.

521
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,630
But Kirk says that the joists
were totally gone.

522
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,424
- They are.
- And the foundation...

523
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,177
- had lost all its structural integrity.
- That's true, too.

524
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:41,180
- Great. So I'm still screwed.
- Not necessarily.

525
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:45,517
I need $15,000, which I can't find,
don't have, and if I don't find...

526
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:46,768
the house is gonna fall down.

527
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,520
- I can help you.
- You can?

528
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,522
I can get a couple guys
who can do the work.

529
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:51,648
You can fix this?

530
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,902
I can help. I know a good contractor
who did some work on the diner.

531
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:57,654
- And the money?
- You won't have to deal with that now.

532
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:00,532
- I won't?
- You can pay in installments if you want.

533
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:03,535
Monthly, bimonthly.
Whatever you're comfortable with.

534
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,412
Let me get this straight.

535
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:08,290
You and some guys
who actually know what they're doing...

536
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,626
are gonna come over, fix my house...

537
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,045
- and I pay them back whenever I want?
- That's right.

538
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,506
- 'Cause I'm Tony Soprano?
- Only scarier.

539
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:19,176
Luke, when I finally do make out
this installment check...

540
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,802
who should I make it out to?

541
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:24,097
You can make it out to me if you like.

542
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:27,809
So basically you would be
fronting me the money?

543
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,563
Yeah. But it's no big deal.

544
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,774
- Luke, that's a loan.
- No.

545
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:37,319
It's just a temporary exchange of money
for services...

546
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:41,406
that will be paid back when you finally
have the... It's a loan.

547
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,034
Man, you suck as a liar.

548
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,037
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

549
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:50,207
- I can't take it.
- I know, but it was worth a shot.

550
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:51,959
Dean called twice.

551
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,547
- You two...
- Don't ask.

552
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,676
What are you gonna do?

553
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,896
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where Mr. Hahn's office is?

554
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:15,399
- Yeah. It's right there.
- Thank you.

555
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:24,408
- You're not seriously sitting there.
- No. It's a hologram. Lifelike, isn't it?

556
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,368
Mom, why are you here?

557
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,245
I wanted to see if you'd show up.

558
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,580
- I did.
- I see.

559
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,124
You made this appointment for me,
not you.

560
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:36,003
I did. But I know Miles,
and I thought my presence in there...

561
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,921
- In where?
- In the meeting.

562
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:40,841
- Okay. Bye.
- Where are you going?

563
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:42,509
Come back here, Lorelai.

564
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:46,763
- Lorelai, stop. Will you stop already?
- I'm leaving, Mom.

565
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,141
- Because I'm here?
- This is a business meeting.

566
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:52,978
I'm not going in with my mommy,
especially since I left my blankie at home.

567
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,814
- You're stubborn and shortsighted.
- Call it what you want.

568
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:59,443
I don't understand why you let your pride
keep you from fixing your home.

569
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:02,488
I don't understand why you can't
stop yourself from butting in...

570
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,990
- where you don't belong.
- I made this appointment.

571
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,783
- Against my will.
- You needed it.

572
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:10,287
- I didn't ask for it.
- This man could solve your problems.

573
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,166
- Don't you understand that?
- Fine. I'll go in. You go home.

574
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:17,961
I can't go home now. His assistant knows
I'm here. It would be rude.

575
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,923
Okay. Here's the deal. We will both go in.

576
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:24,343
You will go in that room,
but you will not say a word.

577
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,678
What? But I couldn't possibly...

578
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,014
You'll say hello. You'll ask how his wife is.

579
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,517
That's it. After that,
you will say or do nothing.

580
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,020
You will sit in a corner, offer no opinions,
and pull a Clarence Thomas.

581
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,355
Am I perfectly clear?

582
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,982
- Lorelai...
- It's the only way I'm doing this.

583
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,734
All right, I'll be quiet.

584
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:43,111
I will. I promise.

585
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:47,866
I swear, one of these days,
'Alice, pow! Right to the moon. '

586
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,828
What on earth are you talking about?
Who's Alice?

587
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,502
There you are. I thought you were here.
I come out, and you were gone.

588
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:00,879
We left something in the car.

589
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:04,049
She left something in the car, not me.
I never do that.

590
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:07,177
That's irresponsible and forgetful.
Two things which I am not.

591
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,471
Miles, this is my daughter Lorelai.

592
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:12,850
- Hello. It's a thrill to finally meet you.
- Same here. Thank you.

593
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,434
- Would you like coffee?
- No.

594
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,354
- Coffee would be wonderful, thank you.
- Coming right up.

595
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:19,398
What happened to you
not saying anything?

596
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,985
Accepting coffee is being sociable.
I haven't asked about his wife yet.

597
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,445
Coffee's on its way.
Why don't we go in and sit down?

598
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,364
That would be lovely.

599
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:36,665
So I understand that Richard's retiring.

600
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,084
Yes. He's going to be a man of leisure.

601
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,587
Well, how nice. Any big plans?

602
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,173
A round-the-world trip has been discussed.

603
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,425
- Really? Any date set?
- Not yet.

604
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,261
- Just checking.
- Marnie, thank you.

605
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,430
I guess we should get down to business.

606
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:54,391
Your mother tells me
you're having trouble finding a loan.

607
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:55,976
Yes, I am.

608
00:32:56,894 --> 00:33:00,772
Before we talk about this, it's so funny,
my mom has just been dying to ask you...

609
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,691
how your wife is doing.

610
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:04,860
Right, Mom?

611
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:08,614
- Yes. How is Cheryl?
- She's fine.

612
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:12,201
Good. Now that we got it out of the way,
about my situation.

613
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,286
Emily tells me that you have termites.

614
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:18,582
We do, and unfortunately, they have
damaged the foundation of my house.

615
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:20,250
That could be terrible.

616
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,921
Remember when you and Richard had
that foundation problem some years ago?

617
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,256
You had a flood in your basement,
wasn't that it?

618
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,800
- Well, actually...
- You know, Mr. Hahn...

619
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:31,512
I appreciate you taking the time
to meet with me today...

620
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:35,057
and I know that the only reason you did
is because of my mother...

621
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,977
but she's really here today
as a kind of silent participant.

622
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,814
Not even actually a participant,
just a silent.

623
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:47,694
I would appreciate it if you would
treat me just like any other person...

624
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:50,823
who's walking in off the street
and asking for a loan.

625
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:55,828
- Of course, if that's what you'd like.
- It is. Thank you.

626
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:58,121
Now, I've brought...

627
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:02,334
all my previous loan documents,
and also my bank statements...

628
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:05,212
numerous recommendations,
and a letter from my employer...

629
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:08,674
which says she's not going to fire me
before you get your money back.

630
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:11,301
You've taken out two previous loans
on this house?

631
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:12,427
Yes.

632
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:15,764
- This is the estimated worth of the house?
- Well, yes.

633
00:34:15,848 --> 00:34:17,683
This is the amount
in your savings account?

634
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:18,767
Yes.

635
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:20,811
- Any other accounts?
- No.

636
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,856
- Any other collateral not listed here?
- No.

637
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:27,860
Well, Miss Gilmore, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

638
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:34,366
That's it? So fast? You didn't even look
at the letters of recommendation.

639
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,493
I'm sure you're a well-liked person.

640
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:39,580
Unfortunately, being well-liked
is not grounds for a loan.

641
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:43,917
But I am good for the money. I pay off
all my debts, and I work really hard.

642
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:48,046
I've been the executive manager of the
Independence Inn for four years now.

643
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,175
This is not a reflection of you as a person.

644
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:53,677
You simply don't have
what the bank requires...

645
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,555
of every other person off the street
to qualify for a loan.

646
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,891
Therefore, there's nothing I can do.

647
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:01,727
Just think about this,
because I have a kid...

648
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:06,190
and she's gotten used to the concept
of having a roof over her head.

649
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,483
- I'm sorry.
- I can't leave without this loan.

650
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,277
- I'm sorry, but...
- No, I mean it.

651
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,363
I can't leave without knowing
there's a way to save my house...

652
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:17,242
so I'm just asking you to take five minutes
and think of something...

653
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,870
anything, that I can do to get this money.

654
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:23,207
You could get someone
to co-sign the loan with you.

655
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,213
That's it? That's my only option?

656
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,006
I'm afraid so.

657
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,429
You knew about this, didn't you?

658
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:49,858
- Would you be willing?
- It would be my pleasure.

659
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:52,861
Wonderful.
I'll have the papers drawn up today.

660
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:56,448
- Would you like some more coffee?
- I would love some. Thank you.

661
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,161
I think that went very well.

662
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,289
- What's the new arrangement?
- Excuse me?

663
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,792
You paid for Chilton.
I gave you Friday night dinners.

664
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,753
- What's this, Sunday night tea?
- I did this for your own good.

665
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:12,130
Wednesday night bridge club?
Monday night football?

666
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,507
Stop it!

667
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:16,635
What? Just please tell me.
What do I owe you?

668
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:18,136
You owe me nothing.

669
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:22,099
I just wanted to do something nice
for my daughter, that's all.

670
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:27,938
It's already shaping up
to be the best season ever...

671
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,317
due in part to the recent arrival
of our brand-new basketball coach...

672
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,153
Lou McGillian...

673
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:38,699
formally the presiding legal counsel
for the Chicago Bulls.

674
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,702
Lou, come on up here. Take a bow.

675
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:46,707
Those other teams had better watch out.
We've got one of the big boys on our side.

676
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,377
Shaq who? In addition to our new coach...

677
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,463
we're extremely proud
of our brand new uniforms...

678
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:57,467
thoughtfully supplied by you,
the citizens of Stars Hollow...

679
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:02,264
and carefully cleaned by the good people
at Tricky's Dry Cleaners.

680
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:06,518
'If it's sticky, try Tricky's. '
So let's hear it for Tricky's.

681
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:11,899
I'm telling you, they are terrific.
Red and white, very durable.

682
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:14,860
Little stripes on the side. You know what?

683
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,988
Why don't you just see for yourselves?
Come on.

684
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,908
- Show them your uniforms.
- It's freezing out here.

685
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,619
Why don't you let them see them
at the game?

686
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,830
The people in this town
paid good money for those uniforms.

687
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:29,166
You show them what they paid for.

688
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,835
This is crazy.

689
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:35,589
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the new uniforms...

690
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:39,301
of the fabulous Fighting Minutemen!

691
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:43,805
Look at them shivering up there.
They're such wimps these days.

692
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:47,184
When I was on the team, it was different.
We were rowdy.

693
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:49,728
Three of us would have been
pantsed by now.

694
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:54,983
- Hey.
- I got your note.

695
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:57,903
Pinning it to the Mallomars
is always a safe bet.

696
00:37:58,111 --> 00:37:59,780
- Coffee?
- Please.

697
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:04,243
Grandma and I went to the bank today.

698
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,119
- How did it go?
- We got the loan.

699
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:09,832
- Good. So everything's okay.
- Yeah, well.

700
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:14,086
- Nice uniforms.
- I'm sorry I told Grandma about it.

701
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:17,631
Hon, there's gonna be a time in our lives...

702
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,842
where occasionally
I'm gonna make a mistake.

703
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,885
- It hasn't happened yet, but it might.
- Sure.

704
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,763
I've earned the right to make that mistake,
and the right...

705
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:28,684
- to fix any problems without interference.
- I just thought they could help.

706
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:32,062
I didn't want their help.
Have you ever been without food...

707
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:34,189
or clothes or books or book covers...

708
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:36,233
- or anything else you ever needed?
- No.

709
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:40,863
The reason for that is me. I have a good
track record for keeping you alive.

710
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:42,156
Yeah, you do.

711
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,783
When I say I can handle something,
you must respect that.

712
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:48,287
Especially since you have no evidence
that I won't. Understand?

713
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:53,041
- Yeah. I understand. I'm sorry.
- I officially declare this fight over.

714
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,585
I'll drink to that.

715
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,629
Stars Hollow High. Let's hear it!

716
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:00,424
- Stars Hollow High!
- Is that Lane?

717
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:05,137
- Stars Hollow High!
- Yeah, that's Lane.

718
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,476
When some loud braggart
starts to put me down

719
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,686
And says his school is great

720
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,855
I tell him right away

721
00:39:56,939 --> 00:40:00,108
'What's the matter, buddy?
Ain't you heard of my school?

722
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:02,569
'It's number one in the state'

723
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:06,198
- Hey.
- Hi.

724
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:09,409
- The music selection, yours, I assume?
- Yeah.

725
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,995
There's a bit of an education process
going on.

726
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:15,666
- I liked it. Very John Waters.
- Thank you.

727
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,502
I don't want you to think
that you can't tell me things.

728
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:21,672
- I don't want to not tell you things.
- This cheerleading thing...

729
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,632
- I know. It's weird.
- It's not weird.

730
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:26,969
If you were doing it professionally,
it would be weird. But this?

731
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:28,804
- It looked fun.
- It was fun.

732
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:30,889
You got them to cheer to madness...

733
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:33,016
so there must be some hope
left in the world.

734
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,520
Rest assured that I remain me:
A Nico-obsessed, Exene wannabe...

735
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:40,232
with 40 Korean Bibles under her bed.
I just bounce a little more.

736
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,527
- Can cheerleaders get coffee?
- Yeah. Coffee's a must.

737
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,654
- Yeah?
- It keeps you perky.

738
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:51,618
So be true to your school now

739
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:55,581
Just like you would to your girl or guy

740
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,876
Be true to your school

741
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:02,296
And let your colors fly

742
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:07,301
Be true to your school

743
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:19,521
Mom, they started work
on the house yesterday.

744
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:24,193
- Good.
- These guys come at the crack of dawn...

745
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:28,113
and all of a sudden there's all this
hammering and drilling and dust flying.

746
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:30,741
- It's pretty impressive.
- They're a nice bunch, too.

747
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:34,953
And the best part is, I've been out there
ten times to bring them coffee...

748
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:37,372
- and I haven't seen a butt crack yet.
- How nice.

749
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:40,167
They should paint that slogan
on their truck. Excuse me.

750
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,045
- Where you going?
- To get some more bread.

751
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:48,175
- I think I'll go help.
- That would be good.

752
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,773
- Mom, I want to apologize to you.
- For what?

753
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:07,653
For doubting your motives
in this whole loan thing.

754
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:11,031
I'm not used to people doing things
without strings attached.

755
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,574
By 'people' you mean me.

756
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:16,245
I don't know what I would have done
without your help. I mean it.

757
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:20,499
I was out of ideas, and then
out of the blue, you make this call...

758
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:24,127
and co-sign the loan with me.
I'm really, really grateful.

759
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:28,507
- That almost sounded sincere.
- Yeah.

760
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:32,594
I should have left off one of the 'really's.
That always tips it.

761
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,472
- All right. I accept your apology.
- Thank you.

762
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:39,226
I'm going to be having my DAR meetings
at the inn from now on.

763
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,894
I hope you don't mind.

764
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,024
She's good.

765
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:29,443
English
