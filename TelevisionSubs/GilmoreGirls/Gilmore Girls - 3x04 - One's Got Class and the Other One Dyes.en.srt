1
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:42,047
So, I think I�m in touch with the other side.

2
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:43,271
The other side of...

3
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:46,480
- The other side. 
- With republicans?

4
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,949
No. Lately I�ve been having these dark premonitions.

5
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:49,922
Oh, about what?

6
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:52,379
Dead cow, dead cow.

7
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:55,180
- That�s weird. 
- He�s always weird.

8
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:58,304
No, I mean, my premonitions have been about death, about my death.

9
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,699
- I don�t wanna hear this. 
- And the thing is, they�re all silly.

10
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:03,003
What do you mean, silly?

11
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:06,224
In one, I slip on a banana peel and fall into a giant vat of whipped cream.

12
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,584
- Silly and fattening. 
- In another, a turtle eats me.

13
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:10,904
- A turtle, how? 
- Very slowly.

14
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:13,321
- There�s lots of chewing. 
- And in your premonition,

15
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:16,634
you didn�t run away from what is perhaps the slowest land animal on the earth?

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,872
His first bite injects me with immobilizing poison.

17
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:19,921
Well, you left that part out.

18
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:21,688
Now, this last one�s a little more gory.

19
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:24,310
- I�m out hunting... 
- A favorite Lorelai Gilmore pastime.

20
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:28,718
And my shotgun backfires and my whole face spins around a bunch of times

21
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,823
and winds up in the back of my head like Daffy Duck.

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,096
- That�s the silliest one yet. 
- Now, if that�s how I go,

23
00:01:33,137 --> 00:01:37,623
you gotta promise to move my face back to the front of my head like Daffy did with his beak.

24
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:38,729
I should be writing this down.

25
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:40,839
You can remember to move my face to the front of my head.

26
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,543
It depends on what I have going on that week.

27
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:46,572
- Hello Stars Hollow, are you ready to rock? 
- Let me guess, band practice tonight?

28
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:50,618
Yes, we�re going to learn our fourth song. That�s practically a set.

29
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:53,521
- I�m impressed. 
- And then once we have a set,

30
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:55,953
we�ll get a gig, and then once we get a gig, we�ll get a record deal.

31
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:56,817
Swallow.

32
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:59,502
And then after we get a record deal, we�ll get really famous

33
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:02,590
and then we�ll have to give all of these interviews about how horrible it is to be really famous

34
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,601
and how we never wanted this in the first place, all we care about is the music,

35
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:07,485
and fame is gonna tear us apart. It�s gonna be great!

36
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,441
And rehearsing in the music shop�s been working out?

37
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:13,531
Perfectly � it�s totally time efficient, being a thirty-second commute from my house.

38
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:17,500
We practice for two hours, I�m home in time to watch reruns of Johnny Yune�s talk show

39
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:20,522
on Korean television with my mom, who thinks I hooked up with you guys �

40
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,240
- which I did, so I�m not even lying. 
- Well, you�re kinda lying.

41
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:27,285
- I�m fibbing, but a fib is not a lie. 
- I�d say it�s a fib-slash-lie.

42
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:31,534
No, no, it�s not a lie, and I can always tell �cause of the few times that I�ve out and out lied to my mother,

43
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:35,415
I�d get this feeling in my gut like a wild animal was burrowing into it, and I�m not getting that.

44
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,011
Wild animals burrowing into my stomach � another one of my premonitions.

45
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,697
- Pretty spooky. 
- I�ve gotta go.

46
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:42,226
I�m single-handedly improving the reputation of drummers everywhere

47
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:44,912
by being on time for every rehearsal. Thanks for the food.

48
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:48,247
- Excuse me. 
- Lane took mine.

49
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:51,170
Okay, this band thing is really not working out for me. Let�s go.

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,141
- See ya, Luke. 
- See ya.

51
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:56,608
Turn sideways!

52
00:02:58,204 --> 00:02:59,400
That girl�s a freak.

53
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:06,132
Make a hole.

54
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:36,997
Whoa, can you guys hold it?

55
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,225
- It doesn�t sound right. 
- It sounded good to me.

56
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:42,179
- No, it�s wrong. Something�s missing. 
- Yeah, volume.

57
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,228
- We can�t play any louder, guys. 
- We�ve got to.

58
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:47,007
But that�s the agreement � free practice space, but we have to play quietly.

59
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:48,099
Just try and live with it, Zach.

60
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:50,859
Dude, Brian�s breathing is louder than the song.

61
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:54,631
I�ve got a deviated septum. All the women in my family and me have it.

62
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:57,207
- Well, it�s throwing me off. 
- Hold your breath when we�re playing, Brian.

63
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,747
There, problem solved. Okay, come on, now, let�s rock.

64
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:02,057
- One, two, three... 
- Wait.

65
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:05,973
The bottom line here is that breathing should not be louder than a rock band.

66
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,939
- Am I right or am I right? 
- You�re right.

67
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:09,318
- Rygalski? 
- Well, it...

68
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:12,487
- We need to crank it up. 
- Just listen harder, that�ll make it sound louder.

69
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,633
Can�t we turn it up at all?

70
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:18,247
Well, maybe we could possibly turn the amps up from three to, say, three and a half, but that�s it.

71
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,079
- Forget it. 
- Zach, come on, we just got started.

72
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:24,637
Dude, Lawrence Welk cranked louder than this. It�s a waste of time.

73
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,191
Wait, Zach, no, you don�t understand. We can�t play louder.

74
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:31,160
See, my mom has this special antenna that can pick up non-Christian music

75
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,443
being played within a football field�s distance of our house,

76
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:36,485
and she�d immediately come looking for me in order to shield me from the perversion.

77
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:41,472
- If Zach�s going, I�m going. 
- Wait, no, Brian, I�m not exaggerating.

78
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:45,063
Once, a guy in our town named Kirk was practicing Bohemian Rhapsody with his band,

79
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:48,134
the Kirk Gleason Five, and my mom shut them down so fast that the band fled

80
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:49,911
without their instruments and never came back for them.

81
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:52,098
To this day, Kirk can�t listen to Queen without tearing up.

82
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,343
- Sorry. 
- Having a free practice space was cool and all,

83
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:58,876
- but not like this. 
- We should just rent a space in Hartford.

84
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,256
- Hartford, Connecticut? 
- It�s not that far.

85
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:05,594
Yeah, or maybe, how �bout France? We could practice in France, too, or Iceland!

86
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,233
- Lane. 
- The moon�s probably available,

87
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,277
- we could crank it way up on the moon! 
- A word, please.

88
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,692
Dave, talk to them.

89
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,926
You�re the leader, that�s flat out insubordination going on in there!

90
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,611
They show be flogged, heel-hogged, strung up from the highest yardarm!

91
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:19,752
- No, I can�t. 
- Why?

92
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:23,704
Because we�re supposed to be a one-for-all band like the Clash or U2 � it�s a democracy.

93
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:25,943
Democracies are overrated. Now get in there and kick some butt.

94
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:26,817
It�s not how it works.

95
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,065
I�ll fix Brian�s deviated septum � I�ll ram one of my sticks up his nose!

96
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,118
Lane, think about this, do you really believe this is working?

97
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,692
No, it�s not working. We sound like a bunch of wankers.

98
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:38,195
We need a real practice space. We need to be able to really play.

99
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:40,439
Wouldn�t you like to actually be able to hit both the cymbals?

100
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,425
- Yeah. 
- Okay, then, we need to do this.

101
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:46,095
- I know, I just don�t wanna leave the band. 
- What? You can�t leave the band.

102
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,689
That�s not what anybody wants, especially me.

103
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,421
Lane, listen to me, okay � you�re perfect for us, it�s working.

104
00:06:50,673 --> 00:06:55,138
So I have to figure out a way to rehearse in Hartford two or three nights a week.

105
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:57,985
- Yeah, that�s not so tough. 
- No, it�s not so tough.

106
00:06:58,073 --> 00:07:02,410
And maybe at the same time I�ll attempt to master quantum physics, and throw Sanskrit in there, too.

107
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:05,856
Do your best. Not with the Sanskrit thing, that�s pretty worthless � but with the band.

108
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,093
I�ll try.

109
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,264
There�s no way you�re gonna become our Pete Best.

110
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,785
- There�s no way. 
- You�re sweet.

111
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:13,638
We should get back in there.

112
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:16,362
Okay, I�ll be in in a minute.

113
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,615
Wrack your brain. I mean, we�ve really gotta think here.

114
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:28,088
- It�s quite a pickle. 
- No, Rory, pickles are smaller.

115
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:31,088
- This is much bigger than a pickle. 
- Okay, let�s stop saying the word pickle.

116
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:31,882
Fine.

117
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:34,990
Now, how many nights a week would you have to go to Hartford to practice?

118
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:38,365
- Two, plus a weekend afternoon. 
- Okay, so that�s three big blocks of time

119
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:40,807
- that you�d have to account for. 
- Very big blocks of time.

120
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:43,444
Plus, you have no car to transport your drums anywhere as of yet.

121
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,359
- Or a driver�s license. 
- Or any drums

122
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:48,867
- because you�re borrowing them from the shop. 
- Temporarily until I can buy my own set...

123
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:52,270
- with money that I don�t know where I�m gonna get. 
- Yup, you�re right, that�s more than a pickle.

124
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:56,731
You�re making light � now stop and focus. And turn down the Cornershop, it�s distracting.

125
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:59,174
No, your Coltrane is distracting, turn that down.

126
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,327
Hey, I�m in angst here and Coltrane speaks to my soul. I can�t turn it down.

127
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,252
Fine, in deference to your soul, I�ll turn mine down.

128
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:09,917
Hey, here�s a crazy thought. How about you tell your mom the truth

129
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:13,792
and insist that she lets you play with the band and rehearse in Stars Hollow loudly

130
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:15,732
as long as your schoolwork doesn�t suffer?

131
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,738
- Oh, I�m sorry, was that a serious suggestion? 
- Hey, it�s worth a shot.

132
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:22,824
No, you�re thinking your mom, here, Rory. If I said that to mine, she�d start waving a crucifix at me.

133
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:25,681
If she says no, she says no, but right now you�re out of options.

134
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,077
We have another call, just think about it?

135
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:30,468
Okay, I will. And hey, you know I like Cornershop.

136
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:32,286
- I know. Bye. 
- Bye.

137
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:35,041
- Hello? 
- Hi, Rory?

138
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:36,929
- Yes. 
- This is Debbie Fincher...

139
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:40,319
- Kathy�s mom from Stars Hollow High. 
- Oh, hi Mrs. Fincher.

140
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:41,943
Well, hi right back to you.

141
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:45,573
You know, we miss you since you started that fancy school of yours. Is it fun?

142
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:48,574
- It�s hard but I like it. 
- Oh well, super.

143
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,952
- Listen, is your mom home? 
- Oh, sure, just a second. Say hi to Kathy for me.

144
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,453
- I will. 
- Hold on.

145
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,101
Phone. It�s Debbie Fincher.

146
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:00,602
Who?

147
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,244
>From Stars Hollow High. Kathy Fincher�s mom.

148
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:04,673
Oh, I remember Kathy.

149
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:09,092
You met Debbie many times, had many conversations with her at bake sales,

150
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:11,026
- school plays, the PTA. 
- Not ringing a bell.

151
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,987
I used to go swimming at her house all the time.

152
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:15,153
You and Debbie had long chats when you dropped me off.

153
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:16,992
No... no.

154
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:21,130
Blonde hair, medium height, drove a Range Rover.

155
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,017
- Does she also breathe and have toes? 
- What?

156
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:26,408
Well, narrow it down to less than eight thousand possibilities.

157
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:28,825
- I did with the swimming. 
- I remember the water.

158
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:32,762
Come on, blonde hair, medium height.

159
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,078
See, even you can�t think of another way to describe her.

160
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:38,231
- You have no memory of this woman? 
- All those Stars Hollow moms looked alike,

161
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,764
except for Lane�s mom and that one mom with the freaky glass eye that never moved.

162
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:42,720
Take the phone.

163
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:47,119
- Hi Debbie, how are you? 
- Great, Lorelai, and yourself?

164
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,920
Just fine, thanks.

165
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:53,356
The gang and I have missed you so much at school events. You were always such a kick.

166
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:55,706
Aw, well, I really miss you and the gang.

167
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,650
Hey, listen, I have a proposition for you.

168
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:02,762
The PTA likes to ask prominent locals in business if they could talk to the students

169
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:05,501
about how they got to where they are � you know, all the hard work it takes,

170
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:07,728
success stories, you know. And we thought about you.

171
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:10,432
To suggest people I know who have success stories, or...

172
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,228
No, silly, we�d like for you to address the class.

173
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:15,957
- Me, really? 
- Well, yes.

174
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:19,206
You�re a young woman and you run that beautiful inn, it�s a huge responsibility,

175
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:22,086
and you do it with such style.

176
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:25,476
Wow, well, that�s really sweet. It�s always nice to be well thought of.

177
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:29,086
Oh, Debbie, before we go any further, I�m dying to know � how�s Kathy? What�s she up to?

178
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:32,501
She is just terrific. She�s applied to a couple schools in California,

179
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,071
so she�s really excited, although...

180
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,292
So she wants me to speak to some kids about my business success.

181
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,778
- Really? 
- Yes.

182
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:42,153
That�s great. What are you doing with the phone?

183
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:45,179
Oh, she�s blabbing about her kid. We probably got another thirty seconds or so.

184
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,330
- You�re awful. 
- No, I�m a kick. Should I do it?

185
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:49,316
Yeah, toot your own horn, you little missy.

186
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:52,624
- I�m a success, who�d have thought? 
- I suspected you had it in you.

187
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:55,625
>From rags to riches... I wonder why Larry King hasn�t called.

188
00:10:55,732 --> 00:10:57,447
Mom, Debbie, please.

189
00:10:58,572 --> 00:11:01,257
... which is a nice bonus for Bill and me, you know?

190
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,355
Oh, sure, yeah. Well, be sure to say hi to her and to Bill,

191
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:07,057
and by the way, yes, I�d be happy to talk to the class.

192
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:09,711
Terrific! Oh, the gang will be so thrilled.

193
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:12,351
Now, there�ll probably be a second speaker with you, do you mind?

194
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:13,704
Oh, that�s fine, who�s it gonna be?

195
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,126
Well, we�ve had some suggestions, but do you know anyone?

196
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:19,326
Well, you know, my friend the Sultan of Brunei is so hard to pin down.

197
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:22,117
Ha-ha, there�s that sense of humor.

198
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:25,977
Well, we were considering Luke Danes, but he usually turns these things down.

199
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:29,368
- I could talk to him if you�d like. 
- That would be just terrific.

200
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,543
The two of you together would be a kick.

201
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:35,619
Well, then, I�ll just kick him �til he agrees to do it, how does that sound?

202
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:38,579
- Okay, Thursday at four p.m., is that okay? 
- I�ll be there, Deb.

203
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:41,282
- Oh, you rat! You rat! 
- What?

204
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:44,203
You remembered how much I hate being called Deb.

205
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,203
I�m wicked.

206
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,831
Well, thank you Lorelai, and I�ll talk to you soon.

207
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:52,215
Okay, bye.

208
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,432
She hates being called Deb.

209
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,819
I�ll make a mental note.

210
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:00,053
I�m so proud of my little success!

211
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:25,389
Stop it, don�t run, just walk in there and tell her what you want.

212
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:28,983
After all, she�s your mother and she wants you to be happy... on some level, I think.

213
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:32,721
Maybe not. What are you doing? Do not back off. Just move.

214
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:35,885
Come on, move. Move your foot, move your foot, one foot.

215
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,605
Lane, move your foot, right.

216
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:39,004
- Lane! 
- Yeah?

217
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,215
- Come with me. 
- Okay.

218
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:46,290
Sit, sit. You want tea?

219
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:49,915
- Mama, I wanna... 
- Sit.

220
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:51,287
Sorry.

221
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,036
I wanted to talk to you about something, an idea I had... have,

222
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:01,661
for me to do something that would be very beneficial to me,

223
00:13:01,717 --> 00:13:05,209
and you by extension because well, if one person is happy, then the other person is happy,

224
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:08,007
and so I had an idea that, of how I could be and then you could be

225
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:11,123
and then we would be and... tea would be good.

226
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:17,062
Here, I want you to fill these out.

227
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,612
- What are these? 
- College applications.

228
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:21,030
- What? 
- Don�t worry.

229
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:23,852
Every one in this pile approved by me and Reverend Melmin.

230
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:25,430
I haven�t heard of one of these schools.

231
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:28,343
They�re all good religious programs, and I�ve already thrown out

232
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:32,567
the ones that let boys and girls sit in the cafeteria together, the party schools.

233
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:34,528
Oh, great.

234
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,867
I will help you fill them out and we�ll mail them on the way to choir practice, okay?

235
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,484
- Yes, Mama. 
- Good.

236
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:45,752
Now, if you meet Jesus walking on the street, what are the three questions you would like to ask?

237
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:53,755
- Your speech for that class? 
- Just some talking points.

238
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:57,298
And this speech is about your success in business, yes?

239
00:13:57,441 --> 00:13:58,460
Pretty much.

240
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:01,077
You must be very fortunate to live in this tiny town

241
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:05,716
where people make very little money. It elevates you by comparison.

242
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:09,816
I wonder who their last speaker was - the fellow in short pants

243
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:12,827
that walks up and down the square with a metal detector?

244
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:13,989
I wouldn�t know.

245
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:18,204
And if they find someone who drives a car that is less than eight years old,

246
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:21,518
what will they do � crown him king of successful people?

247
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,745
Unless it�s a woman, and then they�ll crown her queen.

248
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:25,239
- And if they are... 
- Go away.

249
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:28,803
- Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking. 
- I�m backing out.

250
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:32,735
- Too late, sorry. 
- I�m not speaking to that stupid class.

251
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:35,834
- But you agreed. 
- I�m out, case closed, no debating.

252
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:39,950
Great, fine, do what you want. I guess I�m just out the thousand-dollar deposit.

253
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:41,978
- What deposit? 
- For the room.

254
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:45,588
- What room? 
- For the thing, for the afterwards thing...

255
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:48,332
Oh, wait, now, you�re talking crazy talk trying to confuse me, aren�t you?

256
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:49,484
- Aren�t you? 
- What?

257
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:50,606
- Who? 
- Stop.

258
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:52,443
- Bye. 
- Hold on a sec!

259
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,553
- I agreed to this under coercion. 
- You said yes on your own.

260
00:14:55,634 --> 00:15:00,584
I said yes because when I said no you talked baby talk loudly in front of all my customers

261
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:03,206
until I got so sick of it I just agreed to do it to shut you up.

262
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,605
I�m incorrigible!

263
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:07,483
It�s not a binding agreement, it�s coercion.

264
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,650
Well, you gave in just in time because, I was about to transition out of baby talk

265
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:15,972
and into my Louis Armstrong voice, and that, my friend, is a whole lot worse than baby talk.

266
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:18,408
- I hate that building. 
- What, the school?

267
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,876
Three years of going there, I have no good memories.

268
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:23,017
- You must have some. 
- None.

269
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:26,176
- Kids were as dumb then as they are now. 
- I think you�ll enjoy this.

270
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:29,981
Think about going back to your high school to give a talk. How would that feel?

271
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,996
Okay, not all your points are bad, but it�s not my school, it�s your school,

272
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:38,404
and if you cancel, this whole town will know and when you walk down the street people will point and whisper,

273
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:42,613
�There goes that Luke, he�s a real talk-canceler guy.�

274
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:45,045
- Ouch. 
- Plus, I promised the PTA,

275
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:48,777
- so my fragile reputation is on the line. 
- I think you�ll live.

276
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,400
- Oh, Luke. 
- No!

277
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:53,228
- Hello, Dolly! 
- Stop that.

278
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:55,926
- This is Louis, Dolly! 
- I�ll just hang up.

279
00:15:56,018 --> 00:16:00,729
I�ll be coming �round the diner singing songs.

280
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:03,058
- Have you been diagnosed? 
- See you tomorrow at four.

281
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:09,027
- Oh, it was a fine collection, believe me. 
- She made you apply to every one?

282
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,743
And measured my head for a wimple.

283
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,575
Out of twenty-three schools, there wasn�t one that you might want to go to?

284
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,881
It depends on what I�m looking for.

285
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:18,481
Of course, all the great Seventh Day Adventist schools were represented,

286
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:21,409
with their ban on dancing, gum chewing and bowling.

287
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:25,546
Quaker College was a delightful surprise, with its special appeal to Richard Nixon,

288
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,277
who�s dead but still deeply involved in campus recruiting.

289
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:33,360
Oh, and the piece de resistance! She found an Amish school in Nicaragua.

290
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:36,361
Nicaragua! A big shout out to Mama Kim on that one!

291
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:39,537
Look, Mama Kim always starts out super serious on everything but then lightens with time.

292
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:43,662
But I don�t have time. Schools that I like will fill up and my band, my beloved band,

293
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:46,089
will find another drummer, and if it�s a girl I�m gonna be twice as mad.

294
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,074
- Look, Lane, just try to calm down. 
- No, calm is for losers.

295
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:53,504
I�ve spent my whole life compromising and being the good little girl and not doing what I want.

296
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:56,591
Or doing what I want and hiding it and feeling guilty for doing it, and I�m sick of it.

297
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:59,525
I�m sick of it. I mean, I even lost my first boyfriend because of all this.

298
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:01,046
- What boyfriend? 
- Henry.

299
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,583
- Oh, right, Henry. 
- See, that�s how pathetic my life is.

300
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,707
I�m calling a boyfriend a guy that I never even went out on a date with,

301
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:09,469
and that my own best friend doesn�t even remember,

302
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:11,569
which is not your fault because there�s nothing to remember.

303
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,882
Okay, so besides power walking, what are you gonna do about it?

304
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,571
- Take a stand! 
- What kind of stand?

305
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:17,933
Lane!

306
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,302
- Lane. 
- Follow my anger.

307
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:24,441
- What are you doing? 
- Choosing a color.

308
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:26,852
- You�re gonna dye your hair? 
- Yes, I am.

309
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,581
- Lots of choices here. Help me narrow it down. 
- You can�t do this.

310
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,397
- Of course I can. 
- And what, walk around in a hood all the time?

311
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:35,648
- How are you gonna hide this from your mom? 
- I�m not gonna hide it, that�s the point.

312
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,225
Lane, think about this for a second, at least.

313
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,333
Rory, I�ve been thinking about this my whole life.

314
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,329
Nothing�s gonna change unless I change it, and now�s the time.

315
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:47,810
I need to make a clear statement, one I can�t go back on or chicken out on, one that everyone can see.

316
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:51,301
And this is my instrument, it says �This is me, this is Lane Kim.�

317
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:52,752
That is you, it�s black hair dye.

318
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:55,552
This is merely a prop until we find my true color.

319
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:59,157
Now, what do you think? Pink? Or is that too Pink the singer

320
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:03,244
and Kelly Osbourne and Gwen Stefani... man, there�s a lot of cheese associated with the color pink.

321
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:06,118
Okay, pink�s out. There... there�s blue � what about blue?

322
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:10,795
Blue�s probably not right for your skin tone,

323
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,339
and I agree with you about pink. What about purple?

324
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:15,649
Yes, purple, you�re brilliant.

325
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:17,241
And bleach, don�t forget the bleach.

326
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,818
Bleach, right, okay, I�ll get the bleach. Thank you.

327
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:21,833
And make sure that you get some...

328
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:25,117
gloves.

329
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,057
Got �em.

330
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:29,110
Good, good.

331
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:33,147
- You all right? 
- Yeah, fine, let�s go.

332
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,737
It�s a good day today, isn�t it?

333
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:36,574
Twelve fifty-two.

334
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,572
- And I�ve got exact change for you. 
- Super.

335
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:44,573
- You need something? 
- No. No, I just...

336
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:49,227
I was wondering if there�s a money-back guarantee.

337
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,013
You know, in case her hair falls out or something.

338
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,387
Sure. If your hair falls out, we�ll give you your money back.

339
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,765
Good. You heard that. The second you go bald, you can come get your money back.

340
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,089
Rory, you�re putting a damper on my Independence Day.

341
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,432
Sorry, let�s go.

342
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:12,735
Lucas, la escuela!

343
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,902
- Did you lose track of time? 
- What? Why?

344
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:18,111
- It�s four o�clock. 
- I know.

345
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:20,338
- We were supposed to be at the school, like, now. 
- I know.

346
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:23,820
- But you�re not ready. 
- What? Oh, right, right, sorry.

347
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:27,815
- Okay, I�m ready. 
- Au contraire.

348
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,617
- What? 
- You are so not ready.

349
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:31,517
- What are you talking about? 
- The grunge look is out.

350
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:32,899
Hey, I�m not dressing up for this.

351
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:34,369
Well, you need something better than that.

352
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,290
The whole point of this stupid class talk was for us to talk about our work and our success.

353
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:43,123
This flannel shirt is my most successful outfit. I�ve closed many a deal in this outfit.

354
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:45,473
- It�s my power outfit. 
- Come on.

355
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:48,926
- Hey, let go, let go, hey, you�re pinching me! 
- Go!

356
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:50,733
I don�t wanna change.

357
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:53,026
Be a good boy and I�ll buy you a toy afterward. You wanna toy?

358
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,571
- Sorry to barge in. 
- No problem.

359
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:00,810
- What was that about a toy? 
- Your Uncle Luke is getting one if he�s a good boy.

360
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:02,689
Can we make this more demeaning?

361
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:05,760
Hey, why don�t you go downstairs and help out Caesar?

362
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:07,675
I think my education comes first, don�t you?

363
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:08,955
- Oh my God. 
- What?

364
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:11,080
- Jimmy Buffett? 
- Put that back.

365
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:13,667
You like Jimmy Buffett? He�s so mellow.

366
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:15,745
I�ve just been to a few shows, that�s all.

367
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,633
A few shows? Oh my God, you�re a Buffetthead.

368
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:20,119
Is that the one you want me to wear or not?

369
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:21,791
- Sing Margaritaville. 
- No.

370
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:24,763
- That attitude�s gonna lose you that toy. 
- Stay outta this!

371
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:27,195
- We�ve got ourselves a winner. 
- Fine, fine, come on.

372
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,779
- Just change in here. 
- I�ll be more comfortable in here.

373
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:34,005
I�ve seen you swimming at the lake so I�ve seen you with your shirt off.

374
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:37,595
- Lately? �Cause he�s really let himself go. 
- I�ll be one second.

375
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:38,892
Lose the baseball cap, too.

376
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:41,132
You run the risk of his head falling off without it.

377
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:42,530
I think he�ll be okay.

378
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:52,413
- Something wrong? 
- Uh, no...

379
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,020
No, I just...

380
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:57,415
- No. 
- Happy?

381
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:00,088
Thrilled. Now a tie with that would be just great.

382
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,273
We�re leaving. And it�s gotta be something I don�t have to put together.

383
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,174
- What? 
- My toy.

384
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:05,802
- Got it. 
- Talk good.

385
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:08,332
Wow, we�re late.

386
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:11,568
- Oh, by the way, Jess had a girl in the closet. 
- What?

387
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:13,909
- Come on, pip pip! 
- Who? What was that?

388
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:15,674
Lorelai? What about the closet?

389
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,232
Okay, combs, rags, instructions, timer, towels, tunes.

390
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:24,886
- All systems a go. 
- So far, so good.

391
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:26,997
- Now, are you sure about this? 
- Will you stop?

392
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:29,126
- I�m just making sure. 
- I�ll sign a waiver if you want.

393
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:30,093
Hit play please.

394
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:33,863
- We should open a window, shouldn�t we? 
- It�s freezing outside.

395
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:35,696
Yeah, but the bleach is gonna stink up the whole house.

396
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:39,755
Let it. Let it be the first clue that something�s happened for when my mom gets home.

397
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,817
Let the thick smell of bleach meet her at the doorway

398
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:46,417
like a force that�ll usher her into the next chapter of Lane Kim�s life.

399
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:49,352
The smell of bleach is the smell of freedom!

400
00:21:49,414 --> 00:21:50,478
You�re very dramatic today.

401
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:54,103
To hell with the floor! Oh, that felt good to say.

402
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:55,520
- You done? 
- I�m done.

403
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:56,806
Take your seat, please.

404
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,463
And here we go.

405
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:03,053
- How you doing? 
- Fine.

406
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:05,066
- Feeling good? 
- Feeling great.

407
00:22:05,142 --> 00:22:09,367
This is such a catharsis. I have never felt so naturally high in my life.

408
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,244
- Stings a little, though. 
- Yeah, that happens.

409
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,765
But just a little, no biggie.

410
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:17,390
More than a little actually, it�s kind of a big little.

411
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:20,426
- Just keep me posted. 
- In that case, it�s kind of a lot.

412
00:22:20,494 --> 00:22:22,992
Yup, yup, a lot of sting happening here.

413
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:26,222
Try thinking about something else. God, this smells awful.

414
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,838
Okay, thinking about something else, something else.

415
00:22:28,936 --> 00:22:32,341
Thinking about puppy dogs. Thinking about getting things in the mail.

416
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:34,535
I love getting things in the mail, letters and packages.

417
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:36,235
- Got a package.
- What�s that?

418
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:38,573
Oh, Jim Carrey says that in Ace Ventura.

419
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:40,156
Good distraction. Still thinking...

420
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,956
thinking about world events, lots going on there.

421
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:46,653
Thinking about the last movie I saw. Vin Diesel was in it. Thinking about Vin Diesel now.

422
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,115
Thinking about where Vin Diesel got the name Vin Diesel.

423
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,815
Thinking about Vin Diesel's mysterious ethnicity.

424
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,183
Thinking about how surprising it is to have so much to think about with Vin Diesel.

425
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:58,072
Who knew, who knew? Okay, now I'm just thinking about the pain, we�re into pain here.

426
00:22:58,173 --> 00:23:00,227
- Back to Vin Diesel. 
- I�ve exhausted Vin Diesel,

427
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:02,470
- but the pain, that�s not exhausted! 
- What kind of pain is it?

428
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:05,260
Ever light your head on fire? I haven�t, but I don�t have to now �cause I know how it feels.

429
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:07,493
- I�ll rinse it out. 
- No, we�d have to start all over again

430
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:09,561
and now that I know how much pain there is, I�ll chicken out for sure!

431
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:11,912
- I�m getting dizzy from the smell. 
- Let�s focus on my pain.

432
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
Now read the bottle, tell me what to do in case of pain.

433
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,243
Um, blah blah blah,

434
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:19,464
do not apply to a broken scalp � is your scalp broken?

435
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:21,492
I don�t know, maybe. I don�t know my scalp that well.

436
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:25,393
There�s nothing else about pain. Oh, a girl told me once that if your scalp is hurting from bleach,

437
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:27,121
drink a 7UP. It�s something to do with the bubbles.

438
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:28,921
The Kim household does not have soft drinks.

439
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:30,683
- Well, what do you got? 
- Something called Salad Water

440
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:33,355
imported from Korea. Believe me, it�s nothing like 7UP.

441
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,309
- Oh my God, we have to open this window. 
- Okay, I have got to do something!

442
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:37,508
- Run around the block! 
- Why?

443
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:38,962
- I don�t know! 
- Good enough for me!

444
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:44,092
It�s so good of you both to do this, really.

445
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:47,109
- Oh, we�re happy to be here, right? 
- Yup, zippity doo dah.

446
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,792
Oh, Luke, it must be fun to be back at your old alma mater, huh?

447
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:52,095
Oh yeah, I�m feeling all warm and fuzzy here.

448
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:55,503
Don�t let him fool you. He told me he was so excited about today,

449
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:57,133
he couldn�t sleep last night.

450
00:23:57,207 --> 00:24:00,663
Oh, we�re all excited, too. It�s been so long since we saw you, Lorelai.

451
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:03,591
We had some laughs with this one, let me tell you.

452
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,459
- Oh yeah, she�s a funny one. 
- The book fair of �97...

453
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:09,119
what you said to that one rude customer � uh!

454
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:12,219
Priceless how you put him in his place.

455
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,794
Yeah, I put that man in his place, all right, zing!

456
00:24:14,908 --> 00:24:18,187
Oh, what you said to him! How could anyone forget?

457
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:20,641
- Yeah. 
- Hey, Old Man...

458
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,450
- Old man crowbar... 
- Stick a crowbar in your wallet...

459
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:23,909
- in his wallet dough... 
- and cough up some dough...

460
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,542
cause this is for our kids!

461
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:27,518
You do remember!

462
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:30,069
What, it�s emblazoned up here Debbie, all those good times.

463
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:32,972
Definitely. Now everyone�s gathered.

464
00:24:33,064 --> 00:24:35,833
The vice-principal will finish up in a second and then we�ll call you in.

465
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,925
- Lorelai, you wanna go first? 
- Yeah, sure. Is that okay?

466
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:41,681
- It�s okay by me. 
- Great. See you in a minute.

467
00:24:43,044 --> 00:24:45,533
I couldn�t pick that woman out of a lineup if my life depended on it.

468
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:56,443
- Will you lighten up? 
- No, I won�t lighten up.

469
00:24:56,591 --> 00:25:00,990
I hate this place. Still smells the same � old, repressive.

470
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:03,811
Being back here doesn�t make you nostalgic at all?

471
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:07,271
I liked the final bell, that�s about it. What are those?

472
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:10,529
- They�re my notes for the talk. 
- You put thought into this?

473
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:13,366
- Yeah, don�t you have notes? 
- I run a diner, what are my notes?

474
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,136
I open the door, people come in, they order food,

475
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:17,636
I cook the food, I serve the food, they eat the food.

476
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:20,867
Then there�s a terrific action sequence where I refill coffee and water.

477
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:26,249
And oh, my big finale is a description of the whole end of the evening mopping up ceremony.

478
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:28,932
Hey, you�re sure you don�t mind me going first?

479
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:32,256
Are you kidding? There�s a good chance you�ll yack so much they won�t even get to me.

480
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:34,242
Oh my God.

481
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:35,645
What?

482
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,123
Nothing, nothing at all, Butch.

483
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,591
For the love of... what�s that doing there?

484
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:43,719
What�s it doing? It�s yelling, �Mock me, mock me!�

485
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:45,931
- It shouldn�t be there. 
- Oh no, you�re right.

486
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:49,525
It should have its own special display at the diner with a big old spotlight on it.

487
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:51,784
Don�t they need my permission for this? This should be illegal.

488
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,647
No, those shorts with that tank top should be illegal.

489
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:54,938
Okay, stop now.

490
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:58,876
- What was your girlfriend�s name, Sissy? 
- As a matter of fact, no.

491
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:02,838
Oh, the girls just swooned when Butch Danes took the field.

492
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,029
I knew there was another good reason not to do this.

493
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:07,882
Oh no, don�t walk away, Butch.

494
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:11,512
Well, if I thought you didn�t care, I�d die, I�d just die.

495
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,024
It�s weird.

496
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:17,278
Like straw.

497
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,444
I feel like I should be singing �If I Only Had a Brain.�

498
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:22,553
Now, you feel better? Burning�s completely gone?

499
00:26:22,638 --> 00:26:24,701
Completely. I even think the Salad Water�s helping.

500
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:26,326
Okay, here goes nothing.

501
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:29,356
So have you mentioned dyeing your hair to the band yet?

502
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:31,328
No, but they�ll be cool with it. They�ve all got tattoos.

503
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,893
Dave and Zach have musical themes and Brian�s got Snoopy.

504
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,023
- Poor guy. 
- Yeah, but he�s a slamming bass player.

505
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:39,333
- So you haven�t even mentioned it to Dave? 
- I just said I didn�t tell the band.

506
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:41,841
- Not even Dave? 
- No, not even to Dave.

507
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:43,519
- And what�s with all the pressing? 
- I don�t know,

508
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:46,376
- Dave�s just different from the other two. 
- Of course, he�s the defacto leader.

509
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:49,505
I know, but it also seemed like from the day you guys met there

510
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:52,178
- was a little something happening there. 
- I don�t know what you�re talking about.

511
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:55,460
You�re always talking about him. You always seem to be thinking about him.

512
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,197
And now with this hair emancipation of yours, you�re going to unheard of lengths

513
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,777
to make a statement to your mother about who you are so you can have a shot at staying in the band...

514
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:05,726
- all roads lead to Dave. 
- Rory, Dave and I are professionals.

515
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:08,480
- I know. 
- Plus, the rock and roll highway

516
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:12,214
is littered with casualties of band members who have dated and broken the band apart.

517
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,999
- That�s a sensible attitude. 
- Very sensible, very sensible.

518
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:16,576
Dave and I are very sensible people.

519
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:20,273
- I�m in love with him. 
- I know.

520
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,845
- Is it that obvious? 
- Only to a guy with sunglasses

521
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,147
- and a dog selling pencils. 
- He�s so cute.

522
00:27:25,224 --> 00:27:27,072
- Definitely cute. 
- And smart...

523
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:29,700
you know, that�s such a rare package. It�s usually one or the other.

524
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:31,599
It�s wrong, but that�s the way it usually is.

525
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,708
It just increases the amount of competition for the Daves of the world.

526
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:38,061
- You�re rare, too, don�t forget. 
- I�ve never really felt this way before.

527
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:40,970
I mean, Henry � yes, but we never spent any real time together.

528
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,478
It�s not just puppy love, you know, it�s different.

529
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:47,160
I mean, I get butterflies in my stomach when I think about him,

530
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:50,002
and when I call him to work out times for band practice,

531
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:52,392
the ring of his telephone gets me really excited.

532
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:56,013
And last week, someone said Dave at school � it wasn�t even about my Dave,

533
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,387
- and I almost lost it, I got so shaky. 
- My Dave, that�s so cute.

534
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,255
- Stop it. 
- This sounds like love to me.

535
00:28:01,337 --> 00:28:04,917
- It does, doesn�t it? My first love, wow. 
- Yeah, wow.

536
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,439
I finally have a first love, like what you and Dean have.

537
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:12,014
Right...

538
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,351
- Exactly. 
- Of course,

539
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,632
I don�t exactly have what you and Dean have

540
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:20,032
because you love Dean and Dean loves you back.

541
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:24,006
In my situation, I love Dave and Dave thinks that I have a decent sense of rhythm.

542
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:27,415
- Don�t move, you�ll drip. 
- God, you�re so lucky...

543
00:28:27,518 --> 00:28:31,230
to love a guy who actually knows you love him and who loves you back.

544
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:34,666
- That�s gotta be the best feeling ever. 
- I think this purple�s gonna look good.

545
00:28:34,943 --> 00:28:37,422
I want that. I want that really bad.

546
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:40,514
You�ll have that. You will have your perfect first love and second love

547
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:41,808
and any other love you want

548
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:45,588
because you�re great and purple heads will not be denied.

549
00:28:45,675 --> 00:28:47,181
Now that should�ve been put on the box.

550
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:48,875
Okay, now, head down please.

551
00:28:53,242 --> 00:28:56,684
- Okay, we�re all ready for you guys. 
- Great, excellent.

552
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:02,234
Okay, Luke, you can have a seat here while Lorelai�s talking, okay?

553
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:05,966
- Hey, what�s that? Luke plus Sissy. 
- Start your speech.

554
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:08,927
Okay, everyone, we�re ready to begin.

555
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:13,120
We have two local luminaries here to talk to us today.

556
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:16,832
You probably all recognize Luke Danes from his fabulous diner,

557
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:23,499
but we�re really excited to begin with a former Stars Hollow High mom, Lorelai Gilmore.

558
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:29,484
No, no, save it for when I wow you with my brilliance.

559
00:29:29,955 --> 00:29:31,906
I�m really happy to be here with you all today.

560
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:34,770
I recognize a lot of you from over the years and...

561
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,770
you�re all getting taller and older � stop it.

562
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,317
Anyhow, as some of you know, I run the Independence Inn.

563
00:29:42,086 --> 00:29:47,175
Sounds simple, running an inn. Well, the sentence is simple, the job is not.

564
00:29:47,426 --> 00:29:51,107
Like most jobs, mine involves many other people, people it is my job

565
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:56,565
to hire, to train, and to inspire because when you have good employees it makes you look good.

566
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:59,930
- Oh, questions already, are questions okay? 
- They�re encouraged.

567
00:30:00,053 --> 00:30:01,988
- Yes? 
- You�re Rory Gilmore�s mom, aren�t you?

568
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,108
- Yes I am, and proud of it. 
- Oh.

569
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,837
Oh, is that it? Well, I hope all your questions are that easy.

570
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:09,668
Okay, now, why is it necessary to inspire employees?

571
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:14,328
Why can�t you just train �em and let �em do their jobs? Well... yes?

572
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:16,141
Didn�t you get pregnant when you were sixteen?

573
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,089
Sixteen... it was around that age. Sixteen, that sounds right.

574
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:24,426
Okay. Different people working for you will have different needs...

575
00:30:25,838 --> 00:30:27,323
- Yeah? 
- Well, what about school?

576
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:28,588
School? I�m sorry.

577
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:30,461
Did you drop out when you got pregnant with Rory?

578
00:30:30,585 --> 00:30:34,067
No, technically, I didn�t drop out. I, kept going as long as I could

579
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:36,346
while I got pregnant, which I would recommend to any girl.

580
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:39,269
Not the getting pregnant part, obviously.

581
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:44,185
Although, if that happens, you know... it shouldn't.

582
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,939
I mean, it could but you should try to avoid it...

583
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:50,072
anyway, I got my GED, yeah.

584
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:53,262
Lorelai, why don�t we move this along?

585
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,827
Yes, oh, moving it along, moving it along. Okay, okay, okay.

586
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:59,494
- Boy, I should�ve been more organized here. 
- Well, are you sorry you got pregnant?

587
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:03,243
No, it brought me Rory, but timing is everything.

588
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,553
I mean, I could�ve... sixteen, you guys are sixteen, right...

589
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:10,749
- and hey, is that clock right? 
- What do you mean by timing?

590
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:13,820
Yeah, if you had waited and had a baby with another man at a different time. . .

591
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:15,229
It wouldn�t have been Rory, right?

592
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,179
Hey, you know what�s fun to talk about? Late checkout.

593
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:19,904
But it was good you got pregnant when you did because you got Rory.

594
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:23,109
Look, you guys, this is a very important subject, and I promise that another time

595
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:26,529
I would love to take you all for a cup of coffee and, and talk about...

596
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,816
if you should even be allowed to drink coffee because coffee is for older...

597
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:33,851
Butch Danes, everybody.

598
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:46,283
- What? 
- It�s perfect, I love it.

599
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:48,264
Well, stop primping and get out here.

600
00:31:49,388 --> 00:31:50,332
Whoa.

601
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:53,298
- It�s everything I hoped it would be. 
- It�s very rock and roll.

602
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:54,851
- We�ve gotta take a picture. 
- Get the camera.

603
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:56,268
I am a Kodak picture spot.

604
00:31:57,769 --> 00:31:59,868
- Should I scowl or smile? 
- Surprise me.

605
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,265
This is the most radical thing a Kim has done

606
00:32:02,357 --> 00:32:04,640
since my cousin Nam got caught reading Maxim at summer camp.

607
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:09,125
That must be your mom.

608
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:14,824
Lane? Lane, you�re turning white.

609
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:17,021
What�s wrong? Lane!

610
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:18,557
- I can�t do this. 
- Can�t do what?

611
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:20,432
- Dye my hair. 
- It�s kinda too late.

612
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:22,680
- This is gonna kill her. 
- It won�t kill her, it�ll just shock her.

613
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,265
But the shock will kill her and then she�ll kill me, we�re talking bloodbath here.

614
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:27,528
- We�ve gotta put it back. 
- Put it back?

615
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,175
Back to black, right now, hurry! Go, go!

616
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:32,270
- Go where? 
- Back to the store to get the black hair dye.

617
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:33,932
- No! 
- Yes!

618
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:37,164
- This is insane. 
- Rory, I just drank a gallon of liquid salad.

619
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:39,362
Insanity is a daily staple at the Kim house. Go, go!

620
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:40,446
Okay, I�m going.

621
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:44,583
- Where are you going? 
- You�re messing with my mind here.

622
00:32:44,682 --> 00:32:45,884
You can�t go out that way, my mom will see you.

623
00:32:45,971 --> 00:32:47,641
My head is my normal color, she can see me.

624
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:49,438
But if she sees you, she�ll come looking for me.

625
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,270
- You owe me. 
- Big time forever.

626
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:55,116
Now make like the wind. Go go, go go go go!

627
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:04,625
All I know is I don�t have it, so it�s gotta be at your place...

628
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:08,331
You�re not looking for it, you�re watching TV, I can tell...

629
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:11,875
Yeah, whatever. I�ll just get a new one.

630
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:14,163
So, what are we doing tonight?

631
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:18,434
I don�t know, I�m sick of eating. I�ve been eating like a pig, I feel all bloaty...

632
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:21,972
It is so a word, it�s a word �cause I said it. That�s how words get invented,

633
00:33:22,054 --> 00:33:23,682
�cause people say �em and then other people say �em...

634
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,714
You�re such a jerk sometimes and I�m always nice to you...

635
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:30,401
- Excuse me? 
- I get off at the same boring time.

636
00:33:30,553 --> 00:33:31,569
- Excuse me? 
- Yeah?

637
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:33,381
- I don�t have all day. 
- Hold on a sec.

638
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:36,125
- Will this be all? 
- Yeah, that�ll be all.

639
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:41,092
- I�m growing a beard here. 
- What�s your problem?

640
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:44,697
What�s your problem? I�m a customer, I�m in a hurry, and you�re supposed to assist me.

641
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:46,346
- I am assisting you. 
- Yeah,

642
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:50,775
after you took your sweet time getting off the phone, which by the way, clearly was not a business call.

643
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:53,098
- Un-freaking-believable. 
- Yeah, it is, it is.

644
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,359
The level of service in this place is just that � un-freaking-believable.

645
00:33:57,937 --> 00:34:00,333
- Have a nice day. 
- Yeah, thanks, you too.

646
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,157
And by the way, bloaty is not a word. There�s bloated, there�s bloating,

647
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:07,717
- but no bloaty. 
- Thanks, that�s fascinating.

648
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:11,203
Well, for you, how ice is made is probably fascinating. See ya.

649
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:20,537
- Don�t. 
- I�m trying not to, I swear.

650
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:24,542
- I�m not trying hard, I�ll grant you that. 
- What was with those kids?

651
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,049
So curious, so full of questions.

652
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,849
Shouldn�t their brains be completely fried on TV and video games by now?

653
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,018
- It wasn�t funny. 
- Not from your angle.

654
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,168
>From mine, it was an evening at the Improv.

655
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:37,656
I�m not gonna be allowed within a mile of the school ever again.

656
00:34:37,753 --> 00:34:39,750
On the positive side, you did me a favor.

657
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,012
Now I have a pleasant memory from that school �

658
00:34:42,098 --> 00:34:45,490
you being nailed like a two by four by a group of sixteen-year-olds.

659
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,676
Oh no, what�s this?

660
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,667
Looks like high noon in Stars Hollow.

661
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,680
They�re not carrying tar and feathers, are they?

662
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:56,985
Oh, hi everybody. Wow, the whole gang. What�s up?

663
00:34:57,103 --> 00:34:59,895
Well, I felt obligated to tell the other moms

664
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:01,695
about your little performance at school

665
00:35:01,773 --> 00:35:03,493
before they heard about it elsewhere.

666
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:06,658
Really, �cause usually I like to meet up at Sardi�s after a performance,

667
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,899
wait for the reviews. I hope The Times liked me.

668
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:13,104
- Nothing, huh? 
- So, you�re preaching to our daughters

669
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,344
that it�s okay to get pregnant at sixteen, am I getting that right?

670
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:18,926
No, not at all, I was just answering their questions.

671
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:20,703
Well, it�s your answers we didn�t like.

672
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,735
Hey, I was talking about my job like I was supposed to,

673
00:35:22,811 --> 00:35:25,475
but your kids kept asking about my pregnancy. What was I supposed to do?

674
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:28,153
- Fend them off, change the subject! 
- I tried, Debbie,

675
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,742
but they kept coming at me like I was Poland and they were Nazis.

676
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,092
Remember the old days, girls, when I used to make you laugh?

677
00:35:34,189 --> 00:35:35,000
There�s nothing funny about this.

678
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:37,570
Their questions just threw me off, that�s all.

679
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:39,058
Sounds like you just flaunted your mistakes.

680
00:35:39,156 --> 00:35:42,158
Now, hold on. You have no right to judge me.

681
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:46,413
All I said was that for my particular circumstances things worked out okay.

682
00:35:46,503 --> 00:35:51,102
I advocated nothing to them. You�re all acting like I walked into that room tossing condoms in the air.

683
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:53,267
- You might as well have. 
- Fine, next time I will.

684
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:56,284
I�ll bring a banana and we�ll have a little show and tell. How �bout that?

685
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,984
What kind of mother are you?

686
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,315
The kind that doesn�t gloss over things just because they�re a little uncomfortable.

687
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:05,455
This whole incident was awkward and unnecessary.

688
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:09,468
No, Deb, I�d say, Deb, that what�s awkward and unnecessary, Deb,

689
00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:12,556
is that you all seem to go to the same lousy hairdresser.

690
00:36:12,823 --> 00:36:16,027
- How �bout mixing it up a little, huh, girls? 
- I gotta get going. You good here?

691
00:36:16,115 --> 00:36:18,664
- Yeah, yeah, I�m good. 
- You don�t have to take that tone.

692
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:21,000
You ambush me, then you�re offended by my tone?

693
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,744
So what�s going on out there?

694
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:32,341
Ah, just Lorelai... dealing with some women about something or other.

695
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:35,485
So we did that thing at the school today.

696
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,300
Yeah, it went pretty well.

697
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:41,266
All the kids seemed relatively unarmed.

698
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:47,385
Yeah, I just told �em about the diner and cooking things,

699
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:52,653
and I expect kids all over town will rush out tomorrow and buy a spatula.

700
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:53,728
Checking for monsters?

701
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,418
- Oh, no, just... 
- Just what?

702
00:36:55,536 --> 00:36:57,798
Just didn�t wanna accidentally bump into someone in there.

703
00:36:57,906 --> 00:36:58,792
What are you talking about?

704
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,872
Jess, did you have a girl stashed in there before?

705
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,972
Before what?

706
00:37:02,065 --> 00:37:05,736
Lorelai said you were hiding someone here earlier, she said a girl � were you?

707
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:09,101
- Yes. 
- Jess, you don�t shove a girl in a closet.

708
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:12,060
I did not shove her in the closet. She got in voluntarily.

709
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:14,348
- Oh, sure. 
- Look, Shane freaked

710
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,749
when she heard you guys coming. Next thing I know, she�s in there.

711
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:21,072
I personally didn�t care if you guys saw us or not, but hey � women, right?

712
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,051
You can�t live with �em, you can�t keep �em from jumping in the closet.

713
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:27,984
You and I have got to have a little talk.

714
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:30,922
Hey, if you�re gonna get all Ward Cleaver on me,

715
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,764
I gotta go call Eddie and Lumpy and tell �em I�m gonna be late.

716
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,076
Shut up for a second, would ya?

717
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:38,997
Look, I know you�re at an age where the whole girl thing is...

718
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,227
you know, on your mind a lot, and it�s probably not helping you to think straight

719
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:45,726
with all the hormones and other things that are raging around in there.

720
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:51,266
My point is that you gotta think about things a little better, you know,

721
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:57,610
the way you act. I mean, if you care about a girl the way you do with this Shane...

722
00:37:57,727 --> 00:37:58,892
- I don�t care about her. 
- What?

723
00:37:58,988 --> 00:38:01,962
- I don�t even know her last name. 
- You�re kidding.

724
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:03,683
She mentioned it once. It didn�t stick.

725
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:05,485
Well, if you don�t care about her, what are you doing with her?

726
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,297
Just hanging with her, no biggie.

727
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,424
Well, you gotta be doing something more than hanging with her.

728
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:12,428
I mean, you got to at least be doing something with her to make her jump in a closet

729
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:15,557
- when people come into the room. 
- Relax, will ya? All is good.

730
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:18,399
Jess, this isn�t right. You can�t treat a girl like this, like dirt!

731
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,861
If it�s any consolation to you, she treats me like dirt, too.

732
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,621
- It�s a pretty symbiotic relationship. 
- And that�s fine with you?

733
00:38:23,697 --> 00:38:26,693
- Yes, it is. 
- To just go along in a relationship,

734
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:30,133
- you treat somebody bad and they treat you bad back. 
- That�s right.

735
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:33,978
- Oh, that makes you happy? 
- I�d do backflips but I am way too cool.

736
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:36,933
- That makes absolutely no sense. 
- It doesn�t have to make sense to you.

737
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:39,428
There are plenty other of girls out there in the world, Jess.

738
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:40,809
Don�t you have to get back to the diner?

739
00:38:40,912 --> 00:38:44,206
I mean, you can go out and at least find one that you actually care about.

740
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:46,780
- Oh, like it�s that easy. 
- Yeah, it�s that easy if you try.

741
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:49,677
Hey, the girls that I like don�t give a damn about me!

742
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:52,811
And unlike some other people I know, I�m not gonna sit around hoping

743
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:55,181
that they change their minds and suddenly notice me.

744
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,137
- What�s that supposed to mean? 
- You fixed any neighbor�s porches lately?

745
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:02,888
Or you go on a picnic or you get rooked into giving a ridiculous speech at a high school?

746
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:05,571
- Shut up. 
- At least I�ve got a little self-esteem.

747
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:07,629
- Shut up. 
- I�m not playing Golden Retriever,

748
00:39:07,697 --> 00:39:09,804
hoping one day she�ll turn around and fall in my arms.

749
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:12,104
If she doesn�t wanna be with me, then fine.

750
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:16,458
- You have no idea what you�re talking about. 
- Whatever. I gotta go, Shane�s waiting.

751
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:17,273
Oh, you mean what�s-her-name?

752
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:19,873
Yeah, I�ll bring you a new leash when I get back.

753
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,861
Get outta here.

754
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:28,588
- Busy day, busy day. 
- I�m pretty exhausted.

755
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:31,589
I guess it was just too big of a statement for me to make right now.

756
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:34,589
- Maybe. Oh, hey, I just thought of something. 
- What?

757
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:38,371
- Technically, you have dyed hair. 
- I do, don�t I?

758
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:41,864
I mean, dyed my natural color, yes � but dyed nonetheless.

759
00:39:41,952 --> 00:39:44,339
Not one strand of real color on that head of yours.

760
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,979
So, I guess that means we can score this as a victory, right?

761
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,608
Absolutely, put it in the victory column.

762
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:55,111
That girl�s a freak.

763
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,250
What was that about?

764
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,262
It�s been a very long day.

765
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:02,643
Ah, people who like me, great.

766
00:40:03,288 --> 00:40:05,392
- How was your talk at the school? 
- Oh, just peachy

767
00:40:05,628 --> 00:40:06,621
Is your hair blacker?

768
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:10,604
Oh, I wish you hadn�t have said that. It�s not noticeable, but just stay out of bright lighting.

769
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,776
- What happened? 
- I dyed my hair.

770
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:16,283
Then I dyed it back, but for a full thirty minutes, I looked like this.

771
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:19,401
Whoa, you look cool! You�re insane.

772
00:40:19,468 --> 00:40:21,521
I got sane again, but I will always have that picture.

773
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:23,553
- Oh, hide it at your place? 
- Will do.

774
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:26,611
- I gotta go. And remember, we still need a plan. 
- Yes, we do.

775
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:27,999
Why do we need a plan?

776
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:29,985
A plan so that Lane doesn�t have to quit her band.

777
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:33,104
Lane can�t quit the band! She has to get famous and introduce me to Bono.

778
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:35,341
- I told her that. 
- All right, let�s go eat...

779
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:37,972
see if we can figure out a way to salvage my future as a groupie.

780
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:40,261
- Sounds good. 
- Let�s go to Al�s Pancake World for a change.

781
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,844
He�s doing a salute to Jamaica again.

782
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:44,316
Okay, as long as Al doesn�t play the kettle drums all night.

00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,048
We�ll hide his mallets when he�s not looking.

784
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:51,316
- So, come on, tell me how the talk went. 
- Oh, it was great.

785
00:40:51,393 --> 00:40:54,532
It was one minute on my success in the business world, and that went very well.

786
00:40:54,626 --> 00:40:58,168

Well, don�t wait �til Al�s. Tell me now.

792
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:13,365
Oh, I just love my little fluke.

793
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:14,947
Come on, what happened?

794
00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:18,424
All right. Well, it started off really good and then all these kids
