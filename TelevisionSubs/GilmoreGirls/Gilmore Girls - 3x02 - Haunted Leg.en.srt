1
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,025
Well, this is nice, isn�t it?

2
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:17,326
- So, Grandma, Grandpa is traveling again, huh? 
- Yes, he is.

3
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,174
- Business must be good. 
- Seems to be.

4
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:22,958
- That�s great. Isn�t that great, Mom? 
- A jig is forthcoming.

5
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:25,994
Mom�s business is great, too.

6
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:32,235
I mean, not that it�s without its problem, you know, but they�re usually funny problems...

7
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:37,111
like... oh! Mom, why don�t you tell Grandma about the mouse?

8
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:38,893
- What mouse? 
- Mom?

9
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:44,228
- There�s a mouse at the inn. 
- Is the place dirty?

10
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:48,119
No, it�s just surrounded by this thing called nature and... mice happen.

11
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:51,212
- Mice carry diseases, you know. 
- It�s a tiny little field mouse, Mom.

12
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,581
- I don�t care how big it is, it�s still a rodent. 
- Let�s just change the subject, shall we?

13
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:56,312
- You should set a trap. 
- Got it covered.

14
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:58,668
- Just make sure you don�t use poison. 
- Got it covered.

15
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,286
They will eat the poison and then go into the walls and die, decompose, and the entire place will smell.

16
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:05,017
I�ve got it covered, but thanks.

17
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:09,164
I just have to say, I don�t know why you�re the one sitting here with an attitude.

18
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:11,632
- I�m the one who should be mad. 
- Let�s not do this, okay Mom?

19
00:01:11,693 --> 00:01:14,832
After all, you�re the one who just walked out of here last week without saying a word.

20
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:17,828
- Because I couldn�t get a word in. 
- Your father and I were shocked and upset.

21
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:21,100
- So what else is new? 
- You didn�t give us five minutes to digest the news.

22
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:24,668
- Please, find the off switch. 
- You simply dumped it on us and walked out.

23
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:26,604
- I hardly think that�s fair. 
- Mom, it doesn�t matter.

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,297
It�s over. Let�s just move on, okay?

25
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,219
We came here to have a nice evening, so... come on, let�s have it.

26
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:38,079
Something smells good.

27
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:41,914
- Braised lamb shank. 
- Oh, braised lamb shank!

28
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,682
- I love a lamb shank when it is braised. 
- Oh my God.

29
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:48,657
Reading in front of other people is extremely rude, Lorelai.

30
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:51,022
- Shauna Christy shot her husband. 
- What?

31
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:52,819
Shauna Christy, you remember Shauna Christy.

32
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:55,416
Yes, I remember Shauna Christy, she was a lovely girl.

33
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:59,307
Well, apparently this lovely girl came home to find her husband giving the nanny a nice little bonus package.

34
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,939
- And they say good help is hard to find. 
- That�s just gossip.

35
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:05,191
Gossip? The man was shot thirty-five times.

36
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,762
He looks like a sprinkler system.

37
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:08,749
I can�t believe this.

38
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,094
Shauna was always such a nice girl.

39
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,963
- She was bright, cultured, well-spoken. 
- And apparently a big Annie Oakley fan.

40
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:19,292
- This is not funny, the woman committed a crime. 
- Okay, fine.

41
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,222
- This is a tragedy. 
- My bad, sorry.

42
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:24,939
- A man is dead, a young woman ruined. 
- Consider the subject dropped.

43
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,650
At least she had a husband to kill.

44
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,375
This is nice, isn�t it?

45
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:33,930
- Bless you. 
- Thank you.

46
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:36,868
- I hate having a cold. 
- I know you do.

47
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:40,489
It�s bad enough being sick, but anybody can have a cold.

48
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:41,806
I know they can.

49
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:46,609
I mean, I�d like to have a good illness, something different, impressive.

50
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:50,131
Just once I�d like to be able to say, "Yeah, I�m not feeling so good, my leg is haunted."

51
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:53,015
See, there�s a reason why you only take one packet of TheraFlu at a time.

52
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:53,947
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:57,161
All right, pancakes, one fried egg, side of bacon.

54
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:01,074
Chicken noodle soup, side of mashed potatoes.

55
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:02,306
- Thanks, Luke. 
- Thanks.

56
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,838
- How�s the cold coming? 
- It�s fine.

57
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,615
- Any better? 
- It�s fine.

58
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,992
It�s the third day in a row you�ve ordered soup for breakfast.

59
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,586
- Oh, thanks for the tally. 
- You know what helps get rid of a cold?

60
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,481
Endless vague questioning first thing in the morning?

61
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:14,996
- A healthy immune system. 
- My second guess.

62
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:16,783
And you know how you get a healthy immune system?

63
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,559
Remember when you hated me? That was fun, wasn�t it?

64
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:22,927
Is it eating nothing but crap all day and blowing out your brain cells with coffee?

65
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:24,888
- No. 
- That�s right, no.

66
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:27,351
- Why are you helping him? 
- No seemed like the right answer.

67
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:31,119
Eat a vegetable now and then, maybe some high fiber cereal in the morning.

68
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:32,829
Listen, Grandpa, my soup�s getting cold.

69
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,327
At least eat the carrots in the soup this time, not just the noodles.

70
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:36,322
I promise.

71
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,350
Eat my carrots.

72
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:41,052
Apparently, maturity is extremely overrated in your universe.

73
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:43,951
That�s right. The Empress Bobo Belle forbids it. Eat.

74
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:45,968
- Hey. 
- Hey.

75
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:53,341
- So? 
- One sec.

76
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:56,536
- Jess. 
- Relax. I�m out.

77
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,069
- Let�s go. 
- Okay.

78
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,938
Ladies and gentlemen, an entire conversation in ten words or less.

79
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:07,411
A true meeting of the minds.

80
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:11,549
Okay, so please don�t hate me, but I already ate breakfast.

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,280
- See, nice full sentences. 
- What?

82
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:15,364
Don�t ruin it.

83
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,912
- You�re sure? 
- Positive.

84
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:22,794
- It ran right across the lobby and into the fireplace. 
- I don�t see it.

85
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,496
Well, it must�ve found a hole to crawl into.

86
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:28,216
We cannot have this mouse running around the inn. Customers will freak.

87
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:32,389
Well, tell them it�s a baby. People love babies. They�ll talk to it in funny voices.

88
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:35,204
- Did you call an exterminator? 
- Why, no, what a wonderful idea.

89
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:38,072
I was actually going to fasten a large wedge of cheese to my head

90
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:42,323
and lay on the ground until Mickey gets hungry and decides to crawl out and snack on my face.

91
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:45,506
- When does he get here? 
- He said we were the first stop.

92
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,723
- What do we do until them? 
- Make cat sounds?

93
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,565
- Excuse me, Lorelai? 
- Oh, hey Kirk. Hold on a sec.

94
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:56,434
- Just stand here and make sure it doesn�t come out. 
- Oh, goody, a promotion.

95
00:05:57,376 --> 00:06:00,206
- Hi Kirk. What can I do for ya? 
- I have a delivery for Sookie.

96
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:04,012
- Oh, well, anything good? 
- No, just some wedding photos.

97
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,104
Great. Well, she stepped out for a minute, but I�ll take �em to her.

98
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,745
I swear, I�ll give �em to her.

99
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:16,859
If you want, I�ll leave and find her and then I�ll give them to her.

100
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,193
- No, that won�t be necessary. 
- Okay, well...

101
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:21,933
- Lorelai, can I speak to you for a moment? 
- Oh, sure.

102
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,517
- Could we sit? 
- Sit... sure, let�s sit.

103
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:36,578
- Is everything okay? 
- Okay?

104
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:37,530
- Yes.
- With me?

105
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:40,125
Well, my mother has developed a condition...

106
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:44,626
makes her knees enormous. Yesterday I spent all morning cutting holes in her pants so she could sit,

107
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:48,046
but other than that and the dyspeptic parrot problem, everything is fine.

108
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:49,587
Well, good, I�m glad.

109
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,427
- Okay, well, I�m gonna... 
- I was just wondering...

110
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:56,690
Yes... wondering what?

111
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:59,178
We�ve known each other for a good amount of time now.

112
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,630
Our... paths have crossed professionally and socially a number of times, all with relatively pleasant results,

113
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:08,779
and well, I was just wondering if you would like to have dinner with me?

114
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:12,619
- Oh. 
- In two weeks.

115
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:14,922
- Two weeks? 
- I heard you have a cold.

116
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:17,575
I think two weeks is enough time to ensure the virus is out of your system.

117
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:20,713
- Well, Kirk, I... 
- You don�t have to answer me right away.

118
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:22,865
I know that this is completely out of the blue for you.

119
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:24,396
Take a few days and think about it.

120
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:27,923
Kirk, wait.

121
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,596
By the way, I think you might be the prettiest girl I�ve ever seen...

122
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:34,739
- outside of a really filthy magazine. 
- Thank you.

123
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:43,607
- Don�t. 
- I am doing nothing.

124
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,787
Ben, however, has dropped dead from laughter.

125
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:59,444
- How long have you been sitting there? 
- Not long. An hour... and a half.

126
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,010
- Why? 
- Because.

127
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:02,205
�Cause why?

128
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:07,934
Because today is the last first day of high school you�re ever gonna have.

129
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,536
- You�re insane. 
- I�m not insane,

130
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,184
- I�m just sentimental, and you�re grown. 
- I�m not grown.

131
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:16,321
Yes, you are, you�re all grown up and soon you�ll be going off into the world.

132
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:18,056
- Not yet. 
- But soon.

133
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:22,752
And after you spread those wings and fly away, I won�t have the opportunity to give you this.

134
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:24,611
- What is it? 
- It�s your bill.

135
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,291
- My what? 
- Yeah.

136
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:30,290
I�ve been crunching the numbers, you know, adding up what you�ve cost me over the years,

137
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:34,279
raising you, clothing you, feeding you, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

138
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:38,211
Yes, I�ve itemized everything here by years and income ratio.

139
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,744
- I thought you could factor it into your student loan. 
- Oh boy.

140
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:45,288
One thing that�s painfully obvious here � you�ve used an extraordinary number of diapers.

141
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:48,349
- I�m gonna go take a shower. 
- Really, it�s cost a fortune.

142
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:50,321
What were you using all those diapers for?

143
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,389
I was building my �make Mommy go away� castle.

144
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,165
All right, you got home too late last night and I didn�t get a chance to talk to you.

145
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:57,447
I got home at ten and you were already asleep.

146
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,977
Well, I was trying to watch The Legend of Bagger Vance again.

147
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,687
- Okay, what did I miss? 
- Okay.

148
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:05,887
- Kirk asked me out. 
- Shut up!

149
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,422
Yesterday he came to the inn and asked me to dinner.

150
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:09,896
- That�s so sweet. 
- Sweet?

151
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:12,603
You should wear your dress with the ponies on it. I bet he likes ponies.

152
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,903
- Rory, I cannot go out with Kirk. 
- Why?

153
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:18,262
why? He�s... he�s Kirk!

154
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:20,760
- Well, as long as he loves you. 
- You are not serious.

155
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,937
- I just want you to be happy. 
- "Hello Headmaster Charleston,

156
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:26,766
this is my stepfather Kirk. Please don�t make any sudden movements, he�s a fear biter."

157
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,632
- Okay, so how will you let him down? 
- I don�t know.

158
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,987
That�s why I needed to talk to you, you�re the nice one in the family.

159
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:34,160
Well, you could just tell him the truth. You could tell him that you�re not interested in dating him

160
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:36,285
- and that you just wanna be friends. 
- That sounds so lame.

161
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:37,933
You could tell him you�re involved with someone.

162
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:40,141
Yeah, because my current karma is so great in that area,

163
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,338
I can really afford to jinx it with that kind of lie � no!

164
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:44,273
- Okay, then you figure it out. 
- All right...

165
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,823
- We�re gonna have to move. 
- Okay.

166
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,806
Take off in the middle of the night, leave everything behind, assume different identities.

167
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:55,882
I�ll join a local community theater and I�ll drive you to soccer. It�ll work for many years

168
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:58,744
until the FBI comes to get me, and by that time, you�re on your own.

169
00:09:58,805 --> 00:09:59,767
I don�t play soccer.

170
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,159
You do now.

171
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,425
- Stop! 
- It�s funny.

172
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:14,258
It�s not funny, it�s bad! I have to see this guy.

173
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,941
He works at every business in town, I can�t get away from him!

174
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:19,183
Well, then you should marry him and move in with his mother.

175
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:22,077
- I�ll handle it myself, thank you very much. 
- Sorry, just trying to help.

176
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:25,159
- So you have your swearing in ceremony today. 
- At three, do not be late.

177
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,632
- I will not be late. 
- Okay, I have something to tell you.

178
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,460
- Is it about Vince Foster? 
- It�s about Grandma.

179
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:30,924
- Oops. 
- She�s coming today.

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,409
- No! 
- Mom, I�m sorry.

181
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:34,740
- She found out about it, she called... 
- And you said yes?

182
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:36,331
- She�s my grandmother. 
- So?

183
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,763
- So what am I supposed to say? 
- Say "Sorry, Grandma,

184
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:41,226
but if my mother sees you, she�ll run screaming down the hall."

185
00:10:41,314 --> 00:10:44,319
You�ll be sitting there listening to the ceremony, you hardly have to talk at all.

186
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,675
- Rory. 
- Hey, we are family.

187
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:49,491
Yeah, well, look how great that worked out for Sister Sledge.

188
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:52,428
I�m gonna go take a shower. You�ll be pouting out here when I�m done?

189
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,253
No, I gotta go to work. I�ll see you this afternoon.

190
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:55,133
At three.

191
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,581
There goes my little vice president, off to rule the world.

192
00:10:57,648 --> 00:11:00,755
Well, Paris will be ruling the world. I will be holding her keys.

193
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,902
I�m still proud of you.

194
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:04,913
- I appreciate it. 
- Honey, you have power, brains,

195
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,391
now all you need is a dimwitted, drunken or drug-addicted relative 

196
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,691
to constantly humiliate you while you serve in office.

197
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:12,112
- Will you work on that for me? 
- Two steps ahead of you.

198
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:22,225
- Ah, time? 
- 3:01.

199
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:25,030
No, oh man, not fair, stupid traffic lights!

200
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:28,503
- That�s okay, it doesn�t start �til 3:15. 
- But I so tried to... you lied to me.

201
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,735
- Did I? 
- You said it was at three,

202
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:33,705
- and it�s at three-fifteen. 
- Well, I guess I did.

203
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,745
Ah! That�s it, I�m standing up in the middle of your speech and demanding a recount.

204
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:41,202
- Shall we seat you? 
- Betrayed, lied to and humiliated.

205
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,012
- Well, get used to it... I am in politics now. 
- Hey, where�s...

206
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:46,240
- She�s not here yet. 
- You told her the real time, didn�t you?

207
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:47,827
Well, Grandma can handle structure.

208
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:49,246
- How�s this? 
- Fine.

209
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:52,666
Okay, great. You can sit there and you can put your purse on that chair to save it for Grandma.

210
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:54,508
- Oh, yeah, great idea. 
- Mom.

211
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:55,859
Fine, yeah, saving the seat.

212
00:11:56,352 --> 00:11:58,124
- There, all saved. 
- Thank you.

213
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:00,520
- Now, I�ll meet right outside afterwards, okay? 
- Okay.

214
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,813
I just want you to remember three things while you�re sitting up there:

215
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:06,678
I love you, you�re the greatest kid in the world, and you�re in a skirt, keep your knees closed.

216
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:08,498
- Bye. 
- Hey, this is good advice.

217
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,669
When I was in school, Linda Lee was class treasurer and she could not 

218
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:14,545
keep her knees closed if they were magnetized. Hanes should�ve given her an endorsement deal.

219
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,228
- Lorelai! 
- Hi Mom.

220
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:45,432
You could�ve put your handbag there to save my seat, you know.

221
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:50,678
Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome you. Assemblies like this are always happy ones for me,

222
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,671
initiating in a new group of school leaders. 

223
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:57,571
Chilton�s always prided itself on the quality of its student government,

224
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,110
and this year we may have outdone ourselves.

225
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:02,337
These young men and women up on this stage represent 

226
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:06,137
the best and the brightest of what this school has to offer.

227
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:13,303
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to present to you your student body government of 2003.

228
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,017
... a larger awareness of the world around us.

229
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,133
Problems that not only face us here at school but will face us when we leave school,

230
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:29,101
and more importantly, will face the next generation that follows us.

231
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:34,509
We must learn that our actions have consequences, that someone else will have to clean up our mess.

232
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,299
We need to figure out how to make that mess a little smaller.

233
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:40,423
If a small fraction of these things can be accomplished this year,

234
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:44,687
then I will feel like our administration has done its job. Thank you.

235
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:49,015
In the past, all great empires have fallen.

236
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:51,200
The feeling seems to be that it�s inevitable �

237
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:55,103
that something like what the Romans built could not last. Maybe they�re right.

238
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:59,188
Maybe there is no way of keeping something that big and prosperous permanently.

239
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:02,839
Maybe there is no way of keeping our legacy from becoming obsolete.

240
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:07,807
Well, I intend to fly in the face of such thinking, and damn it, I will succeed.

241
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,569
I certainly don�t wanna come back here twenty years from now on Alumni�s Night

242
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:15,578
and find this place turned into a high priced charm school, pink and white

243
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,113
with big cheerleading megaphones painted on the walls. I wouldn�t be able to take it.

244
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,608
I would have to dismantle the place stone by stone

245
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:27,392
- with my bare hands... 
- I have faith in the Chilton Handbook, so let it be forever.

246
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:29,269
Congratulations and good luck.

247
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:43,454
- Is Rory coming out? 
- That�s what she said.

248
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:49,138
- It was a nice ceremony. 
- Yes, it was.

249
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:50,868
- Long. 
- Very long.

250
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:53,336
- The longest. 
- Lorelai...

251
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:56,516
- Hey. You�re both here. 
- Yeah, we�re here.

252
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:58,907
Of course we�re here. We wouldn�t have missed it for the world.

253
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:01,400
- You looked wonderful up there, Rory. 
- Yeah, good job with the knees.

254
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:04,355
Thank you. I�m gonna run to my locker and get my backpack, then we can go.

255
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,604
- I�ll be here. 
- Bye Grandma.

256
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:11,820
You know, you don�t have to wait, Mom, if you have things to do.

257
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,882
Oh... well, all right.

258
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:21,349
- Lorelai, I was wondering if we could have lunch. 
- Lunch?

259
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:23,388
- Yes, just the two of us. 
- Oh, well...

260
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:24,688
Tomorrow would be good for me.

261
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,053
Tomorrow, lunch tomorrow, lunch with you tomorrow...

262
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,082
We can do it anywhere you�d like. Perhaps at that Luke�s Diner you two seem to love so much.

263
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,436
Lunch � at Luke�s � with you? Wow, I can�t even put the visual together.

264
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:36,521
- I can meet you there at one. 
- One? Well...

265
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:38,748
If one isn�t good, you pick a time. I�ll make it work.

266
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:42,122
All right. One o�clock at Luke�s.

267
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:44,489
Wonderful. I�ll see you then.

268
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:54,120
Look, let�s face it, the last administration might have just as well been running around yelling �Toga!�

269
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,082
for all the brilliant things they accomplished. But this year � everything changes,

270
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,857
starting with the library. It�s completely out of proportion with its subjects.

271
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:06,650
I mean, there�s five hundred volumes on the French Revolution, yet only three on the Crusades.

272
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,740
How do they expect us to get a decent education with inferior resources like that?

273
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:14,067
Seems like the hour�s almost up.

274
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:18,154
Okay, well, I think this has been an extremely successful first gathering.

275
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:21,067
I appreciate all the class presidents coming and being on time.

276
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,478
So before I adjourn this meeting, is there anything anyone would like to say?

277
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:26,541
People�s names might have been nice.

278
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:29,680
Actually, I have something I�d like to put on the table to be discussed.

279
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:34,109
Oh, okay. Well, we only have a couple of minutes, so give us the Reader�s Digest version.

280
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:38,538
As president of the senior class, a certain problem has been brought to my attention.

281
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:44,058
For the past thirty years, the Chilton regulations have stated that skirts must be no higher than

282
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:48,461
three-quarters of an inch above the knee, that�s it. Any higher, the student gets written up.

283
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:53,432
I propose to put to an immediate vote an amendment to raise hemlines an additional inch and a half.

284
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,691
- Hemlines? 
- That�s right.

285
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:58,420
That�s the major issue on the senior class� mind?

286
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,407
It�s one of the major issues, yes.

287
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:03,299
Well, okay � thank you, Francie,

288
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:05,614
for giving us something really important to mull over here.

289
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:08,943
I anticipate a lot of sleepless nights for many of the people in this room.

290
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:12,184
I will take that under advisement and get back to you as soon as I can.

291
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:16,168
Oh, okay, fine. Thanks.

292
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,468
Now, if that�s it, I officially call the first meeting of the Chilton student body presidents to a close.

293
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:21,733
I�ll see you all Friday.

294
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:24,970
What idiot gave her a gavel?

295
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,371
Okay, see, the whole point of having an informal �get to know you� gathering

296
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:33,213
was actually to have an informal �get to know you� gathering.

297
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:34,292
What�s your point?

298
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:36,736
You just spent an hour walking around talking about your agenda.

299
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,896
I�m student body president � that�s my job.

300
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:41,338
But we got donuts, and we didn�t touch the donuts.

301
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:43,873
The donuts are still sitting next to the coffee that we never passed out.

302
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:47,048
We were supposed to spend this time to talk, bond, get to know each other.

303
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,771
Geez, Rory, we�ve been sitting in a room together for sixty minutes � what else do you want, a ring?

304
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,083
Hi. Excuse me, Paris?

305
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:59,014
I just wanted to say on behalf of the entire senior class, congratulations on your win

306
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:02,804
and I�m really looking forward to working very closely with you this year.

307
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,946
- Thanks. 
- Okay. See you later.

308
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,541
Bye Rory. You two are gonna make a great team.

309
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:11,512
Yes, the jerseys are coming on Friday.

310
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:16,510
Okay, I�m gonna drop the demand for the librarian�s resignation tonight. You wanna read it before I send it?

311
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:20,540
Are you sure the first thing you wanna do in office is to get a ninety-three year old woman sacked?

312
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:23,653
Hey, at least I�m not putting her on an iceberg and shoving her off to sea,

313
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:27,432
which considering the fact that you can�t find the Shakespeare section without psychic powers

314
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:31,288
yet the Cliffs Notes rack practically smacks you in the face on the way in, is totally justified.

315
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:32,715
And we�re off.

316
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:38,149
Okay, I just got a message that a vegetarian menu was requested for tonight.

317
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:40,412
Yeah, Lasano�s, party of five at eight o�clock.

318
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:43,346
I thought you said you weren�t gonna let vegetarians in here anymore.

319
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,757
No, you said you weren�t gonna let vegetarians in here anymore.

320
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:48,062
But I�m making my baked stuffed pork chops for tonight.

321
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,469
Well, make �em for the other guests and make something else for the Lasano�s.

322
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:51,824
- Like what? 
- I don�t know.

323
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:55,394
- Pasta, you make great pasta. 
- But that�s boring, anyone can make pasta.

324
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,659
I�m an artist. You don�t dictate to an artist, you don�t tell him what to do.

325
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:02,609
I mean, no ever walked up to Degas and said, "Hey, pal, easy with the dancers,

326
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:05,695
enough already. Draw a nice fruit bowl once in awhile, will ya?"

327
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:08,722
A great artist can make art out of anything, including pasta.

328
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:11,477
- Fine, pasta, whoo. 
- Is there coffee?

329
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:12,798
- Just made some. 
- Great.

330
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,881
- So today�s your lunch with Emily. 
- Yup.

331
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,991
- Any idea what she�s gonna say? 
- No, but I bet it�s not,

332
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:20,781
"I�m joining the circus, feed your father until I get back." I should just cancel.

333
00:19:20,831 --> 00:19:22,849
You can�t cancel, you�re meeting her in an hour.

334
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:26,531
I know, but this goes against every rule I have in the Gilmore survival guide.

335
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:29,694
Number one � no running with scissors. Number two � no pageboy haircuts.

336
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,097
Number three � never ever have lunch alone with a mother.

337
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:33,627
It might not be so bad.

338
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:37,748
Saying yes to this lunch with my mother is like saying "Sounds fun!" to a ride with Clemenza.

339
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:41,533
- Think good thoughts, she could surprise you. 
- I guess.

340
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:43,991
People change, you know. They do it every day.

341
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:46,976
I mean, one minute you could be... oh, let�s say a vegetarian,

342
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:51,262
and the next minute you could accidentally have a bite of a stuffed pork chop

343
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:53,894
- that changes your entire way of thinking. 
- Sookie.

344
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,261
Oh, suddenly life�s fun, suddenly there�s a reason to get up in the morning � it�s called bacon!

345
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,649
- Forget it. 
- Come on!

346
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:03,044
- Pasta. 
- Let the people grow, dammit!

347
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:13,757
- Rory, hi, nice of you to join us. 
- Francie, what...

348
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:15,866
No, I talk, okay? Great.

349
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:19,035
- Now let�s discuss Paris. 
- What about her?

350
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:23,368
She seems to have the very strange idea that she�s actually in charge around here,

351
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:27,887
and I thought it�d be good if I let you in on a little secret... she�s not.

352
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:29,353
Why don�t you tell her this yourself?

353
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:33,152
Because talking to Paris is like shopping for a bathing suit in December �

354
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,259
frustrating, fruitless, and a complete waste of time.

355
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:42,388
Now, you, you might be the wallflower, but you�re obviously the Meyer Lansky behind this organization.

356
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,112
- I am not the Meyer Lansky. 
- What�s that noise?

357
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:50,842
What is that noise? Oh wait, it�s me, still talking. Didn�t you hear it? Obviously not.

358
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:55,733
Anyhow, Paris is student body president � big fat deal.

359
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,689
There are three other class presidents � the junior class president, the sophomore class president,

360
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:05,230
- and oh, yes, the senior class president : me. 
- I know all this.

361
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,371
Well, then, it�s off the short bus for you, isn�t it?

362
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:11,944
Now if Paris thinks she�s gonna march around dictating mandates and ignoring what I have to say,

363
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,876
- then she�s in for a major bikini wax. 
- Thanks for the visual.

364
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:16,690
Without me, she�s nothing.

365
00:21:16,854 --> 00:21:21,405
Just another power mad, insecure, friendless, dateless, highlight-less loser

366
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:25,319
wandering around trying to make someone care that they exist at all, which, by the way, no one does.

367
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:28,953
I control the senior class. I am also the leader of the Puffs,

368
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:31,980
the most exclusive society on this campus,

369
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:35,476
- and I have the power to make her life a living hell. 
- Francie, she�s just...

370
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:38,068
I can make sure she does nothing this year but lead the student body

371
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:41,575
in whatever version of the Pledge of Allegiance happens to be constitutional at the time.

372
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:42,865
What do you want me to do about it?

373
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:47,694
I want you to go back to Margaret Thatcher and tell her to play ball.

374
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:52,470
She�s gonna support the hemline issue, and any other issue that I bring up for the rest of the year.

375
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:57,759
Otherwise I�ll make her so ineffectual, she�ll make Jimmy Carter look like Martin Sheen � do you get me?

376
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:00,310
We�re supposed to be representing the interests of the student body.

377
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:02,130
We are not supposed to be brokering backdoor deals 

378
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:05,630
and pushing through agendas with intimidation and bribery.

379
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:08,862
- I mean, what are we, French skating judges? 
- Wise up, Goldilocks.

380
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,201
- My hair�s brown. 
- This is politics.

381
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:13,796
If you�ve got a problem, tell it to Noam Chomsky.

382
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:16,122
I live in the real world, now blow.

383
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:19,633
Oh, and I would keep this conversation between you and me.

384
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:23,106
Paris tends to get a little paranoid when there�s other mammals at the watering hole,

385
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:27,555
so her finding out that you were conferring with me might not make your vice presidency any easier.

386
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:31,216
I am not conferring with you. A hand came out of the bathroom and pulled me in.

387
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,037
What are you talking about? You sought me out

388
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,138
because you thought Paris was a little out of line today 

389
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,838
and you wanted to make sure my very delicate feelings weren�t hurt.

390
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:43,955
You are so sweet to think of me. I feel much better now that I have you on my side.

391
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:45,906
Bye now, see you at the hemster.

392
00:22:57,657 --> 00:22:59,972
- What the hell are you doing here? 
- Ah, I came for the warmth.

393
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:02,312
Well, you�re just not usually here this time of day, that�s all.

394
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:04,472
- Well, I�m meeting someone for lunch. 
- Oh, Kirk?

395
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:05,957
- What? 
- You�re meeting Kirk?

396
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:09,060
- Why would you say that? 
- Well, I know he asked you out so I just assumed.

397
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:10,647
- How do you know he asked me out? 
- He told me.

398
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:11,722
- He told you? 
- Yesterday.

399
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:13,997
- Oh my God. 
- Hey, relax, I think it�s great.

400
00:23:14,064 --> 00:23:15,378
Why, why would he tell you?

401
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:18,155
- Well, actually, he came to me for a little advice. 
- About what?

402
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:21,962
About whether or not I thought he had a shot with you. After all, I know ya, I�ve been to your house,

403
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:25,015
- I know whether or not you have stain resistant rugs. 
- I�m lying down now.

404
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:27,581
When he found out you had wood floors, he seemed very pleased.

405
00:23:27,652 --> 00:23:29,911
- Oh, Luke. 
- I told him you like movies and junk food,

406
00:23:29,997 --> 00:23:34,600
and of course, talking incessantly, but we both agreed that there�s nothing like some good lovin�

407
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:36,218
to shut a person up, if you know what I mean.

408
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:40,478
I�m sorry, can you bring me a sharper fork? I�m not sure this one will go all the way through your hand.

409
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:44,621
Okay, now, I know it�s new so you probably don�t wanna jinx it, so I won�t talk about it anymore.

410
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:49,352
But I have to tell you, seeing that guy�s face when he was talking about you...

411
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:52,358
- he almost had an expression. 
- Far, far away from me.

412
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:53,607
Love is in the air.

413
00:23:58,113 --> 00:24:00,438
Why are you throwing cutlery in a public place?

414
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,485
Uh, �cause I feel stupid doing it at home?

415
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:04,749
I�m sorry I�m late, there was a little traffic on the way.

416
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:08,051
Perhaps had I been on time, there would still be the possibility of soup.

417
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:10,080
I haven�t been here that long. See, I still have a knife.

418
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:12,054
- I�m glad to hear it. 
- So, you gonna sit?

419
00:24:12,213 --> 00:24:13,330
Oh, yes, of course.

420
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:22,731
There we go. Well, this is nice.

421
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:24,927
You certainly can see the whole town from here, can�t you?

422
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,600
- Yes, you can. 
- I can see why you come here so much.

423
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:29,706
It must be fun to just sit and people-watch.

424
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:32,245
Well, let�s see what they�ve got, shall we?

425
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,343
- Oh, Caesar salad � is that good here? 
- I�m sure it is.

426
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,375
- You�ve never had it? 
- No.

427
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:39,772
- Has Rory? 
- No.

428
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:44,590
Oh. Well, Caesar salads can be extremely unsafe if they use bad eggs.

429
00:24:44,662 --> 00:24:47,324
- Get something else. 
- Of course, if they�re coddled, it would be fine.

430
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:49,619
- Do you know if they coddle the eggs here? 
- I have no idea.

431
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,099
You don�t know? You come here every day.

432
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:52,516
Why don�t you ask Luke if they�re coddled?

433
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:55,809
Oh, he�ll just say they are. I�ll have a Cobb salad. What are you going to have?

434
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:58,967
A Caesar salad with extra uncoddled eggs on the side.

435
00:24:59,054 --> 00:25:01,672
Really, Lorelai, would a serious answer once in awhile kill you?

436
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:03,812
Sorry, Mom. Honestly, I�m a little confused.

437
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:05,506
- About what? 
- About this.

438
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:08,015
- What�s confusing? We�re having lunch. 
- I know we�re having lunch,

439
00:25:08,103 --> 00:25:12,438
but we don�t usually have lunch, especially not in my town at Luke�s Diner.

440
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:15,010
I just figured you had to work, it�d be easier on you this way.

441
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:17,166
- Okay, that�s fine, if I... 
- You two ready to order?

442
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,402
Yes. How is your Caesar salad dressing prepared?

443
00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:22,947
I�ll have to call Paul Newman and ask him.

444
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,101
A Cobb salad and an iced tea.

445
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:28,190
Cheeseburger, fries, onion rings and a cherry coke.

446
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,536
- Any pie today? 
- No thanks.

447
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:34,339
Cutting back a little, huh? Trying to look good for the big day. Smart, very smart.

448
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:37,467
Make sure you check that frying oil with your face.

449
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:42,643
- What was that all about? 
- Ah, nothing, just a little small town charm.

450
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:46,255
Now, please, Mom, tell me � why did you ask me to lunch?

451
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,937
Because I wanted to spend some time alone with my daughter.

452
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:51,815
- Mom. 
- Well, Rory drops by after school every now

453
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:54,073
- and then, so we see her alone. 
- Mom.

454
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:57,115
But we never see you alone... unless Rory leaves the room for a second,

455
00:25:57,196 --> 00:26:00,248
and even then you try to go with her. If I had a nickel for every time

456
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,134
you�ve used the �Girls always go to the bathroom together, Mom� line, I�d be a very rich woman.

457
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:07,739
You are a very rich woman. Mom, please, is this really a �me and you� lunch?

458
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,608
- No hidden agenda? 
- Of course not.

459
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:12,813
Okay, fine.

460
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:17,023
- I talked to Christopher. 
- What?

461
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:22,055
I called him last week, we talked for a very long time, and I have to tell you, he is not in love with that woman.

462
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,067
- Oh my God. 
- He never came out and said it,

463
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,939
but I could tell from his voice. He would much rather be with you and Rory.

464
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:29,572
- Are you out of your mind? 
- I think you need to talk to him.

465
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:32,870
- And that would be a yes. 
- All he needs is to hear that you want this, too.

466
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:35,849
Mom, what the hell are you doing calling Christopher?

467
00:26:35,952 --> 00:26:39,081
- Well, somebody had to. 
- No, somebody didn�t have to!

468
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:43,188
Oh, I certainly wasn�t going to just sit by and watch this situation explode.

469
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,392
You two belong together. It took you years to figure that out,

470
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,408
and now that you finally have it, you can�t let it go away just because of a little complication.

471
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:54,074
Mom, his girlfriend is pregnant � that is more than a little complication.

472
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,725
Women have gotten pregnant since the beginning of time, Lorelai.

473
00:26:56,813 --> 00:27:00,383
And before I result to the totally called for duh, please tell me what your point it.

474
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:03,940
This woman is trying to trap him. Don�t you see that? You can�t let that happen.

475
00:27:04,011 --> 00:27:07,049
- Mom, this is none of your business. 
- Yes, it is!

476
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,469
It affects Rory, it affects you � both of whom are my business.

477
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,229
Do not get involved in this, I mean it. Butt out!

478
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:17,816
Don�t call Christopher and talk about me or us, just stay out of it!

479
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:19,911
- Where are you going? 
- I have to get back to the inn.

480
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:21,160
Do not walk out on me.

481
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:23,771
Mom, I am not gonna discuss this with you now or ever.

482
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:27,545
I would love for you to respect that but I know you, so give Christopher my love.

483
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:30,853
A family life doesn�t just happen, Lorelai. You have to work for it.

484
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:34,263
You have to fight for it. Lorelai, come back here!

485
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,088
So as soon as she gets out of intensive care, we�ll get her signature,

486
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:41,720
and then we can finally set about hiring a new librarian. Anything else?

487
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:46,096
Yes. I was thinking that maybe this year we should throw a little beginning of the school year dance.

488
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:49,526
- I mean, why wait until the tan fades to have a formal? 
- Dances are distracting.

489
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:53,127
Dances help bring in money to pay for those stupid topiaries you want in the quad.

490
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:56,173
Draft a proposal and have it on my desk by tomorrow. Madeline?

491
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,907
I would like to explore the option of having a professional photographer 

492
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,577
take the senior class photos.

493
00:28:00,664 --> 00:28:04,140
Every year we use that cheesy picture place, and every year people wind up

494
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:08,333
with those VH1 �Before They Were Stars� pictures, and I for one would like to stop the humiliation now.

495
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:10,669
How are we going to get a professional photographer?

496
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:14,069
- Helmett Newton is my godfather. 
- Okay, sign him up...

497
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,222
and tell him to leave the whips and chains at home. All right, I think that�s all we have time for today.

498
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:22,292
Excuse me, Paris? I was just wondering if you had time to think about my proposal?

499
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:24,770
- What proposal? 
- You know, the higher hemlines.

500
00:28:24,842 --> 00:28:26,997
Oh right. No, not yet.

501
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:30,203
Okay, I guess I can wait... for awhile.

502
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:32,078
Patience is a virtue. 

503
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:41,801
What do you think about Helmett Newton being Louise�s godfather?

504
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:43,480
- Explains a lot, doesn�t it? 
- Yeah.

505
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:47,316
Listen, I think it might be a good idea to consider getting behind this hemline issue.

506
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:48,550
- You�re kidding, right? 
- No.

507
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:52,047
I mean, if girls want the option of making their skirts a little shorter, then who cares, right?

508
00:28:52,124 --> 00:28:54,653
I care. I�m building a legacy here, Rory.

509
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,171
You want the first stand I make against the faculty to involve a fashion choice?

510
00:28:58,263 --> 00:28:59,820
It would be my �gays in the military.�

511
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:03,799
I just think it would be really smart to establish some goodwill among the other class presidents.

512
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:05,897
- Why? 
- Because you have to work with them,

513
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,611
and you might even need their support on something in the future.

514
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:11,837
And throwing them a tiny bone like a hemline amendment is no big deal.

515
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,612
- I don�t know. 
- Look, it�s right at the beginning of your term.

516
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:17,307
No one will even remember the first stupid thing that you passed.

517
00:29:17,397 --> 00:29:20,240
You have plenty of time to establish your legacy. I mean it.

518
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:24,915
By the time that you implement public executions for line cutters, hemlines will be a thing of the past.

519
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:30,004
- I was making a joke not a suggestion. 
- Why do you care?

520
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:32,451
- What? 
- Why do you care?

521
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:35,048
You seem very invested in this whole thing � why?

522
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:39,411
Hey, I�m not invested in this thing. If you don�t wanna do it, fine. I�m just giving you my opinion.

523
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:45,185
I just thought you might wanna be one of those presidents that�s beloved as well as respected.

524
00:29:46,477 --> 00:29:48,831
Raising hemlines would make me beloved?

525
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:50,972
It�s certainly a step in that direction.

526
00:29:51,715 --> 00:29:53,711
- All right, I�ll push it through. 
- Good.

527
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:56,179
But the next genius who comes up with the brilliant plan

528
00:29:56,256 --> 00:29:59,185
to put Elizabeth Arden in the chemistry class can bite my ass.

529
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:07,505
- I�m not going. 
- You are going.

530
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:09,134
She has done this to me for the last time.

531
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:11,791
>From now on, I�m not giving her any information about my life at all.

532
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:14,361
As opposed to all the details you�ve heaped upon her in the past.

533
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:18,109
I can�t believe she called Christopher. She has no respect for me or my feelings or my privacy.

534
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,520
Well, she didn�t think of it that way. She thought that she was helping.

535
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:22,645
You do know there isn�t a Santa Claus, don�t you?

536
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:24,233
Please just try to forget this.

537
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:26,804
- I�m never ever going over there again. 
- Not an option.

538
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,405
It should be. Sometimes you have to cut people out of your life.

539
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:31,944
- She�s your mother. 
- I want proof, I want tests done.

540
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:33,982
- Do you want your red purse or your blue? 
- Blue.

541
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:37,152
Gee, I wonder who else she�s calling. She�s probably on the phone to Kirk right now.

542
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:41,049
"I heard through my spies you�re taking my daughter out to dinner. Let�s talk China patterns."

543
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,318
God, I�m furious!

544
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:44,096
Don�t get that, it might be her. 

545
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,816
Well, I doubt she�d call when we�re supposed to be over in half an hour.

546
00:30:47,082 --> 00:30:50,322
Hello? Hello?

547
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,334
- The answering machine confused him. 
- Yeah.

548
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:58,929
- And that�s the guy who likes me. 
- I�d consider adoption if I were you.

549
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,004
My life stinks. Hey, let�s look into each other�s eyes

550
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:06,480
and say "I wish I were you" at exactly the same time � maybe we�ll pull a Freaky Friday!

551
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:10,321
Or we can just pretend that we did and you can go around acting really immature.

552
00:31:10,455 --> 00:31:13,296
- Oh wait... 
- I can�t believe you won�t switch bodies with me.

553
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:15,011
Forget it. Then I�d have to date Kirk.

554
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,607
I would switch bodies with you in a heartbeat if you wanted.

555
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:18,907
I know, and I appreciate that.

556
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:22,820
Lorelai, hi. I just called, I think there might be a problem with your phone.

557
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:23,653
- Oh my God. 
- I was just wondering...

558
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,263
- Let�s go. 
- Hello?

559
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,484
- Mom?
- Who is this? 

560
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:28,647
Mom, would you please get off the phone? Mom?

561
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:30,875
- Is this Dr. Marshall? 
- Mom, it�s an important phone call,

562
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:32,793
please hang up. I�ll call you back.

563
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:45,872
Oh, for heaven�s sake.

564
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,972
Hey, I don�t think your doorbell�s working.

565
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,173
Believe me, it�s not the doorbell.

566
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:56,133
Oh, so it was the door.

567
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,324
Yes, Sarah, once again, it was the door.

568
00:31:58,442 --> 00:32:02,696
Okay, so I just have to remember that the really big bell is the door and the small one is the oven.

569
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,416
Yes, that would be a wonderful thing to remember.

570
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,795
Okay, well, let�s have a drink, shall we?

571
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,457
- So, Grandma, you have a new maid? 
- Yes, I do.

572
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,208
Well, good thing we�re in time for happy hour.

573
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:17,167
- Wine, Lorelai? 
- Yeah, if there�s any left.

574
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:21,002
- Rory, soda or water? 
- Soda please.

575
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:26,337
- How about water? 
- Water�s fine, too.

576
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:28,042
- What�s up, Mom? 
- Nothing.

577
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:31,345
- You seem tense. 
- You always think I seem tense.

578
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:33,854
- But tonight you seem tenser than usual. 
- Well, I�m not!

579
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:41,586
- Rory, tell me about school. 
- Oh, okay...

580
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:44,110
- School�s good. 
- Do you like student government?

581
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:46,280
- I think so. 
- And your grades are still good?

582
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:48,948
- Yes. 
- Do you take any sort of physical education?

583
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,279
Not this semester.

584
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:52,861
But eventually you will take some sort of physical education?

585
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:54,668
- I�m not sure. 
- But trust me...

586
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,194
the minute she decides to run after a ball and take a public shower 

587
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,194
with thirty other girls, you are getting a call.

588
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,714
- Well, thank you. 
- Dinner�s ready!

589
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:04,534
- Sarah, one minute please. 
- Yeah?

590
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:06,584
I told you we eat dinner at seven. . .

591
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:10,111
and right now, it�s six-thirty.

592
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:15,247
Therefore, one could conclude that maybe it�s just a tad early for dinner.

593
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:18,364
- Oh, I�m sorry, I... 
- We want to eat at seven!

594
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:20,018
But the food�s ready now.

595
00:33:20,424 --> 00:33:22,528
Okay, never mind, we�ll eat.

596
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,221
We�re eating. Up, up, let�s go.

597
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:32,902
It�s fine. It�s better � then we can all be in bed by nine. Sit down.

598
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:35,247
- Mom, tell us what is up right now. 
- What is up with what?

599
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:36,803
With you, with her, with you and her.

600
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:41,305
Well, she�s new, Lorelai. She�s only been here three days, she�s still getting the hang of things.

601
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:43,885
I think it�s only fair to give the woman a chance.

602
00:33:46,194 --> 00:33:47,259
Why are you staring at me?

603
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:49,946
Mom, you�ve had maids deported who were better than her.

604
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:51,576
- I have not. 
- Talk.

605
00:33:51,817 --> 00:33:56,091
Your father made a crack the other day about my not being able to keep a maid.

606
00:33:56,522 --> 00:33:58,292
Of course, it�s a gross exaggeration.

607
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:01,642
Yes, I�ve had maids I haven�t liked, but I�ve also had maids I�ve loved.

608
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:02,681
Name one.

609
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:05,062
- Daiha. 
- Who?

610
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,520
- You remember, she took you shopping once. 
- How old was I?

611
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,677
- I don�t know. 
- Guess.

612
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,095
Four, five.

613
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,788
Mom, you haven�t liked a maid since I was four or five?

614
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:16,430
I have liked a maid; you asked me whom I loved. I loved Daiha.

615
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:19,430
- And whatever happened to Daiha? 
- Oh, how should I know? But I loved her.

616
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:22,886
- Okay, so salad? 
- Thank you, Sarah.

617
00:34:23,214 --> 00:34:26,342
- Oops, big bell. 
- Sarah, the salad! Sarah!

618
00:34:27,391 --> 00:34:29,804
- Pass the wine, Lorelai. 
- You want a straw with that?

619
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:32,355
- You�re enjoying this? 
- Well... yeah.

620
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,882
- Lor, I need to talk to you. 
- Chris, what are you doing here?

621
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,736
- You won�t return my calls! 
- Did you do this?

622
00:34:37,802 --> 00:34:39,420
- I knew you�d be here. 
- I did not do this.

623
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:42,072
- You gave me no choice. 
- After I told you to just stay out of it!

624
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,157
- Lorelai, I did not do this! 
- You have to go.

625
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:46,132
I�m not going until you talk to me.

626
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:48,442
Christopher, Lorelai, come back here!

627
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:49,809
Why won�t you call me back?

628
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:52,005
Hey, there couldn�t be a worst time to have this conversation.

629
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:54,642
Really, because it seems to be the only time to have this conversation.

630
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,211
Look, go home, okay? I promise I will talk to you tomorrow.

631
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:00,721
- Well, sure, I believe that. 
- Hey, I�ve never lied to you.

632
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:02,435
- There�s no reason to doubt my word. 
- Really?

633
00:35:02,507 --> 00:35:05,231
- Forty-five unreturned phone calls isn�t a reason? 
- No, it isn�t.

634
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:07,239
You shutting me out like this is wrong.

635
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,126
I�m not discussing this with you here in my mother�s house.

636
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,917
You don�t get to dictate this. I need to talk to you, you won�t call me back,

637
00:35:12,973 --> 00:35:14,684
and I did what I had to do. And I�m sorry � 

638
00:35:14,773 --> 00:35:17,084
but after all we�ve been through, especially over these last few months �

639
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:20,777
you shutting me out is wrong. And you know what hits me the hardest, Lor?

640
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:24,094
- Apparently it isn�t the door on your way out. 
- You keeping Rory from me.

641
00:35:24,193 --> 00:35:26,665
- What? 
- I never, ever thought you�d do that.

642
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:28,585
- I�m not keeping Rory from you. 
- Oh really?

643
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:32,317
Then why hasn�t she called me back, huh? I mean, no matter where you and I have been in our lives,

644
00:35:32,374 --> 00:35:35,006
my daughter has always called me back � until now.

645
00:35:35,077 --> 00:35:36,451
- Hey, listen to me... 
- I didn�t call you back

646
00:35:36,554 --> 00:35:39,633
because I didn�t want to. Me � Mom had nothing to do with it.

647
00:35:39,711 --> 00:35:41,334
- Okay, honey, calm down. 
- You promised me.

648
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,476
You promised me at Sookie�s wedding that this was going to work, 

649
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,876
that you were going to be there, you promised me.

650
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,898
- Honey, please understand... 
- No, I always understand,

651
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,655
and I don�t wanna understand! I don�t even really wanna talk about this right now.

652
00:35:52,712 --> 00:35:55,600
I�ve got Mom, that�s all I need. Go be somebody else�s dad!

653
00:35:55,682 --> 00:35:58,483
- Don�t say that. 
- I�m going upstairs. Call me when he�s gone.

654
00:36:01,217 --> 00:36:04,741
- She did not get there by herself. 
- Hey, have you ever met your daughter?

655
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:07,812
She could get anywhere by herself! She could get to the third dimension by herself!

656
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:09,786
She was helping the crossing guard when she was four. 

657
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,686
- I�m going to talk to her.
- No, you�re not. 

658
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:15,871
She wants to be alone and cool off. Respect that. I�ll talk to her later.

659
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:17,914
You�ll talk to her, great. That makes me feel a whole lot better.

660
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:19,798
Okay, you need to leave, right now.

661
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:24,935
- This isn�t right. She needs her father. 
- I know she needs her father,

662
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:28,292
I�ve been telling her she needs her father! But she feels like her father bailed on her

663
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:31,206
and she�s mad and hurt, and I can�t change that in three minutes!

664
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:33,552
- Do you think I like this situation? 
- Oh God.

665
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:35,871
Do you? I mean, after what you and I had going and now �

666
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,447
Chris, do you remember why we�re here right now?

667
00:36:38,524 --> 00:36:42,087
What event in your life caused this very pleasant moment we�re sharing?

668
00:36:42,138 --> 00:36:45,743
- That has nothing to do with this. 
- Oh... it... what? Chris, man!

669
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,884
- What do you want from me? 
- I wanna talk!

670
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,984
- About what? 
- I don�t know. I just...

671
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:54,264
- I don�t like how things are. 
- But that�s how they are!

672
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,725
- I didn�t want things to turn out this way! 
- But they did turn out this way!

673
00:36:57,812 --> 00:36:59,413
But I didn�t want that!

674
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:02,128
- Christopher, is Sherry still pregnant? 
- Of course she is.

675
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:03,582
- Are you still with her? 
- Yes.

676
00:37:03,695 --> 00:37:05,835
- Are you gonna marry her? 
- Yes.

677
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:10,116
- Then, honey, we are where we are! Accept it. 
- I can�t.

678
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:15,252
Don�t you understand that I can�t talk to you because it hurts talking to you, really hurts!

679
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:19,491
Standing here right now is killing me, okay? Don�t you understand that?

680
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:23,265
- Christopher, I think you�d better go now. 
- Emily, I...

681
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:26,378
Leave now, please.

682
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,626
You know, you need a mask and a horse when you do that.

683
00:37:43,814 --> 00:37:45,038
Something�s burning.

684
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:50,807
Chris?

685
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:54,192
Give it time.

686
00:38:08,325 --> 00:38:10,291
- Well, now, that was a fun night. 
- Yup.

687
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,635
- I haven�t had that much fun since labor. 
- Ba-dum-bum.

688
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:14,555
But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, is this on?

689
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:17,463
- I can�t believe he just came over. 
- He misses you.

690
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:20,214
- He misses you. 
- We�re very missable.

691
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:22,549
Honey, he loves you so much, he didn�t mean to mess... 

692
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:25,149
No, he never means to, but he does.

693
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:27,807
And I don�t care what he says or does, I�m not going to this wedding.

694
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:28,969
- You don�t have to. 
- Good.

695
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:32,292
But you might, at a later point in your life, when you�re not so angry

696
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:36,107
and you make up with your dad, as we both know you will, you might be sorry you missed it.

697
00:38:36,553 --> 00:38:40,235
- It�s the wrong wedding. 
- Ah, things happen for a reason.

698
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:42,963
- Since when is that your philosophy. 
- Since now.

699
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,929
- By the way, I�m also a communist. 
- Really?

700
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,375
- Yes, �cause I look damn good in red. 
- I�m starving.

701
00:38:48,477 --> 00:38:50,653
- Really? Could it be �cause dinner sucked? 
- Could be.

702
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:52,542
- Let�s do mac and cheese. 
- And tater tots

703
00:38:52,641 --> 00:38:54,710
- And those little pizza rolls. 
- Oh, and chili beef soup.

704
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:57,848
- After which we will install our own vomitorium. 
- Okay, nix the soup.

705
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:01,392
And add some cake. Okay, let�s be organized � make it fast, make it snappy,

706
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:03,961
- and if there�s any impulse buying, make it chocolate. 
- Aye aye, captain.

707
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,073
- Lorelai! 
- Oh no.

708
00:39:07,818 --> 00:39:08,968
- Go on in. 
- Are you sure?

709
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,094
- I have to take care of this. 
- Good luck.

710
00:39:12,493 --> 00:39:13,249
Hey Kirk.

711
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:16,465
Lorelai, I know you haven�t made up your mind yet, and I�m not here for an answer.

712
00:39:16,532 --> 00:39:20,500
- I just need to know : are you allergic to tuna? 
- Uh, no.

713
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:22,599
No, good. Thank you very much.

714
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:24,280
Kirk, I have made up my mind.

715
00:39:24,525 --> 00:39:25,221
- You have? 
- Yeah.

716
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:26,112
- Already? 
- Yes.

717
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:27,992
- And it�s fully formed? 
- Yes, it is.

718
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:30,378
- You don�t need any other information? 
- No, I don�t.

719
00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:32,749
- �Cause I could have my mother call you if... 
- Totally unnecessary.

720
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:35,840
Okay, well, then, go ahead.

721
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:40,208
I just got out of a really weird relationship, and I know that sounds like a line, but it isn�t.

722
00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:47,500
I�m just not... fully over the shock of it yet, and I never wanna hurt you

723
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:50,081
because you�re my friend and I like you,

724
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:53,849
so I have to say no. I�m sorry.

725
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,079
Was the tuna inquiry too personal?

726
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:00,724
Oh, no, I thought it was very thoughtful

727
00:40:00,828 --> 00:40:03,332
You�re sure you won�t feel like it anytime soon?

728
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:05,001
Yeah, I�m sure.

729
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,822
Well, at least I asked.

730
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:09,518
Goodnight Lorelai.

731
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:18,995
- Doing a little shopping? 
- Yes. Excuse me.

732
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:22,635
- Why the cold shoulder? 
- No cold shoulder. I just have perishables here.

733
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,324
Oh yeah, you wanna get home before that beefaroni goes bad.

734
00:40:25,446 --> 00:40:26,665
My mom�s waiting for me.

735
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,728
- How was Washington? 
- Fine.

736
00:40:28,974 --> 00:40:30,536
- Do anything interesting? 
- Nope.

737
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:32,051
- Okay. 
- What about you?

738
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:34,064
- What about me? 
- Anything interesting happen?

739
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:35,743
- This summer, I mean. 
- Nope.

740
00:40:35,862 --> 00:40:37,131
- Really? 
- Really.

741
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,383
So nothing happened this summer, at all?

742
00:40:39,558 --> 00:40:43,223
It was hot. Two weeks ago there was a run on snowcones.

743
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:47,059
Machine broke, people went crazy, Taylor tried to call in the National Guard, but...

744
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:49,876
- I�m not talking about snowcones. 
- What are you talking about then?

745
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:50,679
Nothing.

746
00:40:53,976 --> 00:40:56,241
- Her name�s Shane. 
- As in �come back�?

747
00:40:56,352 --> 00:40:59,071
- Yup. 
- Well, great. That�s great.

748
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,074
- Really, it�s great. 
- So I�ve heard.

749
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:03,050
- Well, it is. 
- Are you upset about something?

750
00:41:03,157 --> 00:41:04,928
- No. 
- I mean, me and Shane...

751
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:06,015
What about you and Shane?

752
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:09,041
I don�t know, it didn�t exactly bring a smile to your face.

753
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,478
Well, I�m still freaked out about the, uh, snowcone machine.

754
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:13,802
- Okay. 
- I could care less about you and Shane.

755
00:41:13,883 --> 00:41:15,688
- Good. 
- It just surprised me, that�s all.

756
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:16,926
- Why? 
- Because.

757
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:20,004
- Because why? 
- Because of what happened at Sookie�s wedding.

758
00:41:20,131 --> 00:41:24,970
Yeah, so me coming back here and just seeing you with Shane just kind of threw me for a sec.

759
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:27,858
I'm sorry, did I hear from you at all this summer?

760
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,915
Did I just happen to miss the thousands of phone calls you made to me,

761
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,711
or did the postman happen to lose all those letters you wrote to me?

762
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:37,443
You kiss me, you tell me not to say anything... very flattering, by the way.

763
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:39,583
You go off to Washington... then nothing.

764
00:41:39,656 --> 00:41:41,842
Then you come back here all put out because I didn't just sit around 

765
00:41:41,956 --> 00:41:43,742
and wait for you like Dean would've done?

766
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:47,300
And yeah, what about Dean? Are you still with him?

767
00:41:47,392 --> 00:41:50,746
'Cause last time I checked, you were, and I haven't heard anything to the contrary.

768
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:54,366
Plus, the two of you walking around the other day like some damn Andy Hardy movie.

769
00:41:54,483 --> 00:41:56,405
Seemed to me like you�re still pretty together.

770
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:59,440
I half expected you to break into a barn and put on a show.

771
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:00,766
When did you see me with Dean?

772
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:03,404
At that stupid summer insanity plea the town put on.

773
00:42:03,491 --> 00:42:06,316
