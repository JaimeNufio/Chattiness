1
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:56,297
- Morning. 
- Morning.

2
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:58,494
Someone woke up in project mode today.

3
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:01,013
I�m like the army, baby. I get more done before nine o�clock in the morning

4
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,145
than others get done all day.

5
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:04,234
As long as you don�t abandon it mid-project.

6
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,801
I do not do that.

7
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:08,248
- Make your own seashell candles. 
- Not fair.

8
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,957
The place smelled like melted crayons for three weeks.

9
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:13,272
- This is different. 
- Fine, what�s the project?

10
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:18,458
This is a pile of every catalog we have received for the last three months.

12
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,625
I have gathered them all together,

13
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:24,972
and I will now proceed to call all the companies that are sending us duplicates

14
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:27,347
- and tell them to stop. 
- That�s very environmental of you.

15
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,641
It�s getting ridiculous. We get, like, eight of some of these.

16
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:30,921
- You�re kidding. 
- Check this out.

17
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:35,397
This is a stack of identical catalogs mailed to Lorelai Gilmore,

18
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,739
Rory Gilmore, Lorelai Rory Gilmore, Lorelai V. Gilmore,

19
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:41,157
Lorelai Victoria Gilmore, Lorelai Gilmo,

20
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:43,681
Lorelai Gil, and Squeegy Beckinheim.

21
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:44,634
How�d that get in there?

22
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,652
I once told a store my name was Squeegy Beckinheim

23
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:48,827
just to see how many catalogs they would sell my name to,

24
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:51,812
and apparently my name is to catalog companies what Brooke Shields� picture

25
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:53,865
- is to Chinese restaurants. 
- How many?

26
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:54,951
- Ten. 
- Wow.

27
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:57,296
Including one we were already getting seven catalogs from.

28
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:58,908
So apparently you made the problem worse.

29
00:01:59,058 --> 00:01:59,923
Unintentionally.

30
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:02,483
This one is addressed to Tookie Clothespin.

31
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:04,879
Oh, I forgot my code name at the second store I tested,

32
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:06,595
so I told �em it was Tookie Clothespin.

33
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:08,070
Which means we get even more catalogs.

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,493
Again, it was unintentional.

35
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:12,934
When you start a forest fire unintentionally, it�s still your fault.

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,895
You�re putting calling myself Squeegy Beckinheim

37
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:17,833
and Tookie Clothespin on a level with starting a forest fire?

38
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:18,832
It�s killing trees.

39
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:20,461
You�re depressing me now.

40
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:22,892
Well, get on the phone and stop the madness. That�ll cheer you up.

41
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,930
- I need coffee. 
- There�s more coffee.

42
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:28,141
- I should get ready, too. 
- You�re stopping mid-project.

43
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,322
- I�m bored. 
- Then don�t start these projects.

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,601
I promise I�ll finish. I just wanna check on the seashells.

45
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,412
These catalogs will be sitting here forever.

46
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,697
No, they won�t. They�re biodegradable.

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,627
Come on, I�ll call half, you call half, okay?

49
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,067
You do yours first, then I�ll do mine.

50
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:46,006
We only have one phone. You�re young. You�ll dial faster.

51
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:47,030
Squeegy!

52
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,874
The bottom line is that too many birds are landing atop the street lights

53
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,475
and relieving themselves on helpless passersby.

54
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,910
And I dare say that some of these birds seem to be doing it on purpose.

55
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:00,523
- You get dumped on, Taylor? 
- It�s not just me...

56
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,728
Hey, if anybody has a picture of Taylor getting dumped on,

57
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,573
- I�ll pay top dollar. 
- I�ll check the internet.

58
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:07,378
Taylor, all animals have to... you know.

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,652
How are you gonna stop birds from doing that?

60
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:13,154
Easy. Put sharp metal spikes on the top of the fixtures,

61
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:15,305
then when they land, pow � they�re shish-kabobs.

62
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:17,241
- That�s cruel. 
- You can�t do that.

63
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,133
I�d rather have bird crap fall on my head.

64
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:20,742
There it is � our new town slogan.

65
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:22,764
- I like it. 
- I see coffee mugs, T-shirts.

66
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,787
Don�t forget stuffed shish-kabobbed birds.

67
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,410
That moan when you squeeze �em.

68
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:30,261
- Excuse me. 
- May I help you, sir?

69
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,954
Yes, I was looking for... ah, there she is...

70
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:36,267
- Patricia. 
- Patricia... well, well, well.

71
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,138
- Now stop it. 
- Are you ready?

72
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:42,084
I�m right in the middle of something, Jesus,

73
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,869
- but I�ll be right out. Patience. 
- Okay.

74
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,453
- Now, as we were saying... 
- Who�s the fox, Patty?

75
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:50,512
Excuse me.

76
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:54,669
I met him at a funeral. Great guy, good dancer, Latin...

77
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:57,347
People, order please.

78
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,170
He better treat you right, this guy.

79
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,686
Yeah, how well do you know him?

80
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,766
Well, I just met him.

81
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:04,537
- I could look him up on the internet. 
- People, please!

82
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,974
Now, due to the lack of response, we�ll hold off on the bird spikes.

83
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,951
- Good. 
- Let Miss Patty�s date begin.

84
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,505
It�s a digital. I want a full visual account.

85
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:22,104
Hold it. There�s one more issue that must be addressed before we can adjourn.

86
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:27,204
All right. Now, that weird, taciturn fellow who�s always walking around

87
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:30,793
with his backpack has put in an absurd request

88
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:33,657
to stage a protest in the town square.

89
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:35,654
- The town loner? 
- That guy still lives around here?

90
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:38,044
- Somewhere in the hills, right? 
- I thought he was long gone.

91
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:40,793
No, he came into the bookstore a couple times last month, never said a word.

92
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:42,888
- He�s a bit creepy. 
- Very creepy.

93
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:45,412
But he�s our Boo Radley, and we don�t have a Boo Radley,

94
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,410
unless you count the troubadour or Pete the pizza guy

95
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:48,936
or the guy who talks to mailboxes.

96
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:51,097
Well, I think the point is that every town needs

97
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,299
as many Boo Radleys as they can get.

98
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:55,075
- Yes, that�s my point. 
- What�s he protesting, Taylor?

99
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:57,205
Well, that�s not indicated here, but it doesn�t matter,

100
00:05:57,282 --> 00:06:01,438
because protesting is not allowed in the town square, period. It�s un-American.

101
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:04,009
- You mean like the Revolutionary War? 
- And Rosa Parks?

102
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:06,835
That�s different. They were against the British and buses.

103
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:09,319
No one likes the British or buses.

104
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,879
Yes, dear, what is it?

105
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:13,681
Oh, I�m sorry, I thought I heard my name.

106
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,965
No, he said buses, dear, not Jesus.

107
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:17,194
Sounded like Jesus.

108
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:20,932
Could this meeting be more disrupted?

109
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,089
I could do a soft shoe.

110
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:23,876
Yeah, while I pound out a beat on the bongos.

111
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,232
- Ooh, that sounds like fun! 
- I got bongos in the back.

112
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:30,133
Seeing as how our attention spans are gnat-like tonight,

113
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:34,627
as town Selectman I am refusing the town loner�s request to protest

114
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:37,024
and I am adjourning this meeting.

115
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,167
She�s all yours, Jesus!

116
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:41,182
We got nothing of substance done in this meeting.

117
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,463
And the tradition stands.

118
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:45,735
What do you know about this town loner guy?

119
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:47,850
Same as everyone. Just kind of skulks around

120
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:49,499
with that backpack, never smiles.

121
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,987
Does he also make cheeseburgers and secretly harbor a desire to wear

122
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:53,430
- a backwards baseball cap? 
- What?

123
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:56,094
- They�re cousins, identical cousins... 
- Stop it.

124
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:57,966
Well...

125
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:02,417
look who�s back behind the wheel. Lovely.

126
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:05,111
Mom, I�m gonna get going. I�ve got some studying to do.

127
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:06,416
Okay, babe. I�ll catch up with you.

128
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:09,974
- When did Jess get a car? 
- Oh... recently.

129
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:12,851
- Where�d he get it? 
- He got it from a guy around here, at a place.

130
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:14,328
- A guy at a place? 
- Yeah.

131
00:07:14,424 --> 00:07:16,426
- You had no idea he had a car, did you? 
- Not in the least.

132
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:18,346
Way to have a handle on things, Luke.

133
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:19,800
Well, he doesn�t share a lot with me, you know?

134
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:21,239
And he�s got a license. What can I do?

135
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:23,913
- Stop him before he kills. 
- He�s not gonna kill anyone.

136
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,561
He�s got a bad track record with cars.

137
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,809
Yeah, I know, okay? I�m not exactly thrilled with this.

138
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:30,001
Okay. I�m sorry. It�s your thing. I�ll just butt out now.

139
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:31,495
- Where�d he get the money? 
- What?

140
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:32,693
For the car. Where�d he get it?

141
00:07:32,842 --> 00:07:34,306
I don�t know. Working at the diner?

142
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:37,716
I can barely afford a car on the money I get working at the diner.

143
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:40,189
Maybe it was a gift from someone... who doesn�t know it�s gone yet.

144
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,002
Thanks.

145
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:42,248
- I�m helpful, aren�t I? 
- Bye.

146
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:42,903
Bye.

147
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,760
So... you got a car.

148
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:53,784
Motor Trend�s not gonna be giving it any awards,

149
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,657
but it�ll get me from point A to point B.

150
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:57,761
Yeah, I guess it�ll get you around. So...

151
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:00,200
where�d you get the money for it?

152
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,581
- Mugged an old lady. 
- Jess.

153
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,511
- It didn�t cost that much. 
- What�s not much?

154
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:05,899
Less than a lot?

155
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:08,122
Jess, where did you get the money?

156
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:09,708
You know that hash you sling at the diner?

157
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,186
I scrape it off the plates in the back. Remember I work for you?

158
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,366
- Yeah, I know you do. 
- Okay, then.

159
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,887
I also know I don�t pay you enough to buy the car.

160
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:19,504
I saved up my pennies and I bought the car from Gypsy.

161
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:21,419
She gave me a good deal. That�s how I got the car.

162
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,200
Okay, so you bought a car.

163
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,950
Now, the price of the car is just one small thing.

164
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,977
- It�s just the beginning. 
- Oh, yeah?

165
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:29,877
Did you take the additional expenses into account?

166
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:31,065
- Like... 
- Insurance?

167
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:33,604
- I�m in good hands. 
- Liability, uninsured motorist?

168
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:35,883
All the paperwork�s in the glove compartment. Feel free to check it out.

169
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:37,035
Money for gas?

170
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:39,477
You mean this didn�t come with a never empty magical tank?

171
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,638
- Jess. 
- I factored that in.

172
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:42,714
You�re gonna have repairs.

173
00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:45,678
Yeah, and I can fix most of �em myself and save up for the rest.

174
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:48,484
Plus, I�m gonna make sure to replace the oil every couple months.

175
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:50,634
Right, I bet you didn�t think of that, the oil. That costs money.

176
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:51,982
I�m the one that brought it up.

177
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,014
- You�re the one that didn�t think of it. 
- No, but... I just...

178
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,481
Sign this.

179
00:08:57,674 --> 00:08:58,545
The registration?

180
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,562
- I�m still a minor. 
- I don�t have a pen.

181
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:06,255
I guess it�s okay that someone else�s name is crossed out on it

182
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:07,803
- and that yours it written in. 
- Yup.

183
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:08,981
- Just checking. 
- Thanks.

184
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,771
- I�m glad we had this talk. 
- Yeah, same here.

185
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:17,884
- Hello! 
- I�m in here!

186
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,720
Wow, you beat me home by two minutes

187
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,528
and your nose is already in the books.

188
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,800
I can go from zero to studying in less than sixty seconds.

189
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,475
Very impressive. Mail call.

190
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,378
- What�s this? 
- Mortgage payment.

191
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,339
You mind picking it up this month sweetie, baby, cookie, honey?

192
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,598
- No, not at all. 
- It�s just something addressed to you.

193
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,451
It�s an invitation.

194
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,538
An invitation to what? Oh, is it the White House again?

195
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:43,328
- Those boys never give up. 
- It�s to Sherry�s baby shower.

196
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:44,550
- Who? 
- Sherry.

197
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:46,159
Sherry Tinsdale. Dad�s Sherry?

198
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:47,956
You�re kidding.

199
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,835
It�s at her and Dad�s house on Sunday.

200
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,171
Wow, that is very weird.

201
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,027
We haven�t had contact with Christopher in months.

202
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,738
She must know we�re on the outs with him, right?

203
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,550
Yeah, but she may not know how on the outs.

204
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,998
Zero contact is maximum on the outs.

205
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:04,719
Yeah... although there may have been some.

206
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,046
- Some what? 
- Some contact.

207
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:11,362
Oh... you�ve been in contact with Christopher?

208
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:14,342
- Yeah, I�m sorry. 
- On, no, hon, don�t apologize.

209
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:16,754
You�ve always been totally free to talk to him whenever you want.

210
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:19,247
I�ve told you that. I mean, he�s your dad, right?

211
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:22,801
- So don�t apologize. 
- Okay, I take the apology back.

212
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:24,337
I think it�s good you�ve been talking to him.

213
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:27,839
- It is a little weird you didn�t tell me, though. 
- Yeah, sorry.

214
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:29,349
Will you stop apologizing?

215
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:31,670
Even when I feel like I should apologize, I can�t apologize?

216
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,564
- Yeah, it�s a little annoying. 
- Sorry.

217
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:35,637
- Rory. 
- I�m just trying to lighten the mood here.

218
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,297
The mood is light. I just hate that you thought

219
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:39,335
you had to hide something like that from me.

220
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,643
I just kind of felt like I was betraying you or something.

221
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:43,512
- Well, you weren�t. 
- I know that now.

222
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,242
So, how much contact have you had with him?

223
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,180
Not tons. He emailed me a month or so ago,

224
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,665
I emailed him back, and now we occasionally talk on the phone.

225
00:10:54,808 --> 00:10:56,707
Does he ever ask about me?

226
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,634
What answer will freak you out the least?

227
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:01,111
- The honest one. 
- Yes, he asks about you

228
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:04,019
because Dad will always care for you very much, you know that.

229
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:07,307
Do you want me to say hello for you next time we talk?

230
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,904
- No. 
- Fine.

231
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:11,342
What should I do about this?

232
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,036
It�s your call.

233
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,879
I guess being in Dad�s world automatically means being in Sherry�s.

234
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,674
And it is your little half brother or sister she�s carrying.

235
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:19,902
I know, it�s weird.

236
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:21,844
Sort of a good reason to make some connection with her.

237
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,046
Yeah, but it�s gonna be one of those brunchy quichey things

238
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:26,289
where I don�t know anyone, and it�s all the way in Boston.

239
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,335
- I�ll drive you there if you want. 
- Really?

240
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,667
Yeah, I�ll do some Boston shopping while you quiche it.

241
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:32,535
And we can set up some sort of SOS signal

242
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:34,128
that I can page you with if I want to bail early?

243
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:35,833
- Sure. 
- What should the SOS signal be?

244
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,661
- How about... SOS? 
- Perfect.

245
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:39,719
- So you�re going. 
- I guess I�m going.

246
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:41,761
Good, I think you�ve made the right decision.

247
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:46,406
So do I. And I shouldn�t have hid that I�m talking to Dad. I�m really s...

248
00:11:47,302 --> 00:11:48,981
- Starving. 
- I�ll get some ice cream.

249
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:02,226
You�re up early.

250
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:04,875
- I got a few errands to run. 
- You got time before school?

251
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,947
- I got wheels. 
- Right, right, you got wheels.

252
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:12,340
- Lid. 
- By the way, I owe you ten bucks.

253
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,004
- When did I loan you ten bucks? 
- Last night.

254
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,341
I wasn�t here last night.

255
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:17,088
You�re always here, Uncle Luke � in my heart.

256
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,473
You took money out of the register

257
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:19,995
I�m going to the bank now. You�ll get it back today.

258
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:23,503
I told you a hundred times, do not take money out of the register.

259
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,347
Gotta run.

260
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:26,334
Lid.

261
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,227
Oh... what can I get you, Kirk?

262
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,314
Patty melt and a coke.

263
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:39,559
You want the melt cut into squares or stars today?

264
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,301
- Half and half? 
- Okay, coming right up.

265
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:42,166
Thanks.

266
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,392
Man, that car�s a honey.

267
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,044
Duel piston cams, diplex overdrive with maximum torque,

268
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:51,766
sixteen liter side by side, firing three on one... sweet.

269
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:54,455
- Kirk, none of that makes any sense. 
- What?

270
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:57,046
I know a little about cars, that was all gibberish.

271
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,400
Oh, well, would you mind not telling people about this?

272
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,620
I�ve cultivated a reputation as sort of a car aficionado

273
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:06,364
and in reality, all I have is a Jan and Dean record.

274
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,828
- I�ll keep it to myself. 
- I should probably listen to it again.

275
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,765
Yeah, I would.

276
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:13,861
Man, I wish my mom would let me have a car...

277
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,232
or a bike...

278
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,245
or my roller skates back.

279
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:23,671
- You don�t take care of it. 
- I take great care of it.

280
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:26,676
- This truck doesn�t like you. 
- Oh, is it talking to you now?

281
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,243
Your transmission�s shot.

282
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:30,270
I shift up and down a lot.

283
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:32,130
Mr. Grind-it-�til-you-find-it, huh?

284
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:33,610
Just tell me what needs doing.

285
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:35,376
Be faster to say what doesn�t need doing.

286
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,711
- Whatever you want. 
- You ride your breaks.

287
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,324
Bad for the truck, good for me.

288
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:41,802
I like replacing brakes. Pays for the cable TV.

289
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:44,398
No problem. How �bout I just make the check out directly

290
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:46,344
to your cable company, would that be easier for you?

291
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:48,259
Yeah, thanks. And get some extra checks

292
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,127
�cause you�re gonna be making one out to my milkman, too.

293
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:54,183
Oh, and looky here, you just bought me a couch

294
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:56,949
- Hey Luke. 
- Hey Gypsy. I don�t wanna interrupt.

295
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,741
No, please, interrupt.

296
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:00,487
I need a little break from the gaiety.

297
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,530
What can I do for you?

298
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:05,250
Well... Jess came home with this car

299
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:06,954
and it says on the slip that he bought it from you.

300
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,726
Yup, it�s working great, if that�s what you�re wondering.

301
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:09,985
No, I know that, it�s just...

302
00:14:11,138 --> 00:14:12,673
He paid you for it, right?

303
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:15,647
- Nothing�s free at Gypsy�s. 
- And he paid cash?

304
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:16,718
Mostly twenties.

305
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,812
Did you make sure Andrew Jackson was on the bills,

306
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:21,384
- not Alfred E. Newman or someone? 
- Looked real to me.

307
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,452
Well, when he took the money out of wherever he had it,

308
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,396
did a mask or a gun fall out?

309
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:29,274
No, but he was carrying it in a canvas bag with a big dollar sign on it.

310
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:30,508
- Really? 
- No.

311
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:32,137
- Good. 
- Guys are stupid.

312
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,827
What?

313
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,554
You strip your gears, you ride your breaks,

314
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:37,129
and if we don�t laugh after we make a joke, you think we�re serious.

315
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,946
I don�t ride my brakes!

316
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,071
I just want to make sure it was on the up and up.

317
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:42,898
Hey, when people come in with cash,

318
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:44,416
I don�t ask where it comes from, do you?

319
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:46,049
Nah, I guess I don�t.

320
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:47,358
- Thanks. 
- Anytime.

321
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,947
Oh, goody, a trip to Florida!

322
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:53,965
This is outrageous.

323
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:58,792
The town unanimously refused to let that loner freak protest in the square.

324
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,178
Why would the two of you consider allowing him

325
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:02,710
to do it from the steps of your church?

326
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,554
The town didn�t refuse him, Taylor � you did.

327
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,888
So you�re spearheading this revolt, Reverend?

328
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,957
Reverend Skinner and I share the church for services, Taylor,

329
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,235
so if there�s gonna be a protest, it�ll be a joint decision.

330
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:13,196
I can�t even look at this mayonnaise.

331
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:14,646
- I got it, David. 
- Thanks, Archie.

332
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:17,502
I could still ban it. I could get the town council together,

333
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,852
find something on the books. I�m sure there�s a way.

334
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,069
The church is exempt from your town statutes, Taylor.

335
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,221
We answer to a higher authority... like the hot dog.

336
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:27,600
- I laugh every time you say that. 
- I know. Funny is funny.

337
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,989
I can guarantee that God does not want this either.

338
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:31,932
Did you hear that, David?

339
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:34,605
Taylor Doose is in direct communication with God.

340
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,048
Thirty years I�m working for God, I haven�t received so much as a card.

341
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,798
Is it by phone that you speak with him, Taylor?

342
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,867
- Do you have a God phone, Taylor? 
- Rabbi, please.

343
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,263
What�s he like? For us common folk who�ve never met him?

344
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,039
- Is he short, is he tall? 
- Does he like to laugh?

345
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,329
Is the whole shellfish thing really serious? Because, I gotta tell you,

346
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,782
- some of these Red Lobster commercials... 
- They look good, huh?

347
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,245
Oh, with the melted butter? Oh my God.

348
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:54,871
Can we stay serious for a minute here?

349
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:55,978
You�re too uptight, Taylor.

350
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:56,582
And no matter how much steam blows out of your ears,

351
00:15:56,838 --> 00:16:00,318
- our decision will be final. 
- So it�s hardball, huh?

352
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:04,154
The council gave you special permission to run bingo out of that building.

353
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:05,946
- We could withdraw it. 
- At your peril.

354
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,704
Meaning?

355
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:09,695
You�re gonna tell my little old ladies, my bubbies, you�re shutting down their bingo?

356
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:11,687
I�m not afraid of your bubbies, Rabbi.

357
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:14,560
Oh, God, thank you for letting me be in the room when Taylor said that.

358
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,157
Gentlemen, I would sincerely like to thank you for wasting my time.

359
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,355
Our pleasure, Taylor.

360
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:23,550
I can�t believe that you, Reverend Skinner, of all people,

361
00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:27,374
would do this to me after all the support I�ve given you over the years.

362
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:29,583
All the support? Taylor, you�re a Sunday Protestant.

363
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,994
You come in, you say �Hi God�, you sing a song, and you leave.

364
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:33,412
I always leave a dollar!

365
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,086
For your singing voice, you should leave two.

366
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,176
Well, fine, if you feel like that,

367
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:39,531
maybe I will just stop showing up altogether.

368
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:43,453
Maybe I�ll convert to something else and give them my generous weekly donation.

369
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,102
- Do you want him? 
- Not after the whole bubbies thing.

370
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:46,802
Maybe the Shakers in Woodbury would take him.

371
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,096
Yeah, he�s already got the beard. Can you make furniture, Taylor?

372
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,012
Goodbye gentlemen.

373
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,122
- How�s it going? 
- Ah, pretty slow.

374
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:00,171
Is Jess upstairs?

375
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:01,969
- I haven�t seen him. 
- Okay, thanks.

376
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:09,030
Jess?

377
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,548
Hello?

378
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,488
Oh, hey Randy, what�s up?

379
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:35,588
Someone�s gotta take care of it, you know? It�s not going to take care of itself...

380
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:38,880
I understand, I get it. What else?

381
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,657
- So do you think I got a good gift? 
- It�s foolproof.

382
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:45,016
It�s not very original.

383
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,818
A new mother can�t have too many baby blankets.

384
00:17:46,895 --> 00:17:49,864
Not with the insane amount of stuff constantly oozing out of a baby�s every orifice.

385
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,777
- I just call it like I see it. 
- Well, call it less graphically.

386
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,542
The very concept of childbirth is vaguely disturbing.

387
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:58,692
Yeah. Kids are cool and all, but getting there seems like a big cosmic joke.

388
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:00,070
Definitely thought up by a man.

389
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,420
My mom said that when she told me where babies come from.

390
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,380
- My mom still hasn�t told me. 
- Really?

391
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:06,131
When my cousin got pregnant, she said it�s because

392
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,138
an angel brushed its wings against her face.

393
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:10,259
I could fill you in on the details sometime if you want.

394
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:11,835
No thanks, I�ve picked it up off the streets.

395
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,501
- That�s new. 
- Is it?

396
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,404
I�ve never seen it before, and I�m very into the minutia around here.

397
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,022
- That�s for sure. 
- Do you know whose it is?

398
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:22,096
- Yup. 
- Whose?

399
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,079
Jess�.

400
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,839
Jess? Jess, the guy who wrecked your car?

401
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:28,073
- He�s got a car now? 
- Mmm, looks that way.

402
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,975
- That�s outrageous! That�s a travesty! 
- It�s not that big a deal.

403
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:33,709
- Oh, it�s a humongous deal. 
- You�re taking this very hard.

404
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,618
Because we�re best friends, Rory.

405
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:37,888
We�re linked. I feel what you feel. Except for right now

406
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,627
because you don�t seem to be feeling anything and I�m incensed.

407
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:41,866
It�s just a car. It�s nothing to get excited about.

408
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:45,154
- Hey Lane. 
- Hey back at ya, tough guy.

409
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:46,316
- What? 
- Lane...

410
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:47,514
- Something wrong? 
- No...

411
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:49,179
- Yes! You have a car. 
- I know.

412
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:50,473
- Don�t give me lip! 
- Lip?

413
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:52,127
- Lane... 
- How�d you get the car, Jess?

414
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:53,351
- I bought it. 
- Really,

415
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,168
I thought you might�ve built it from parts left over from cars you�ve totaled.

416
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:57,948
- What is your problem? 
- Don�t play dumb.

417
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:59,353
- You know what you did. 
- I gotta go.

418
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:01,472
Yes, drive on away, we�ll just keep walking.

419
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,869
That�s all Rory�s been able to do these past few months � lots of walking.

420
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:05,409
She�s got bunions because of you, mister!

421
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,171
- Bunions? 
- I don�t have bunions.

422
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,014
She�s too nice to complain about her foot ailments.

423
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:11,422
- Knock if off, Lane. 
- Just get in the car and go, Jess.

424
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:14,059
- I didn�t start this. 
- Well, you started it when you wrecked Rory�s car.

425
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:16,481
- Tell your friend to walk it off. 
- You walk it off.

426
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,483
- I�m trying to drive off. 
- Then go.

427
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:22,891
Geez, how Andy Griffith is this town that people get so excited by a car?

428
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,452
It�s not the car, it�s who�s got the car.

429
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,768
Okay, fine, you want it? Take it, I�m sick of this.

430
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,410
- I don�t want this piece of junk. 
- Right.

431
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:31,784
I suppose Dean is already building you another car, something really snazzy.

432
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,469
- Shut up and go. 
- Gladly.

433
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:34,903
- Let�s go. 
- Gladly.

434
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:38,768
Oh, and by the way, you left your bra in the back seat.

435
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:50,171
This must be the place.

436
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:51,912
I think the balloons confirm it.

437
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,540
- No pink, no blue. 
- All green.

438
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:56,321
Aren�t baby shower balloons supposed to reflect the sex of the baby?

439
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,082
Blue for boys, pink for girls.

440
00:19:58,252 --> 00:20:00,889
- You would think. 
- What�s green for, aliens?

441
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:03,003
- I�ll ask when I go in. 
- We�re all set, right?

442
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:05,359
- Anytime you want out, just send up a flare. 
- I will.

443
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,417
Even if I�m half-naked in a changing room,

444
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,481
I�ll just grab everything and rush out.

445
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:11,262
You making a half-naked entrance would be funny.

446
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:15,056
Oh, I�m sorry, I totally snuck up on you.

447
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:17,002
- It�s okay, hi. 
- Hi, Rory.

448
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:20,285
- Lorelai, I�m so excited you came. 
- Oh, I�m just dropping Rory off.

449
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,103
- Oh, don�t go. Stay. 
- What?

450
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:25,456
- Come to the party, please? 
- Oh, I don�t know.

451
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:28,063
I know that you weren�t invited, but it�s just �cause my friends

452
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,370
didn�t think that you�d be comfortable. I told them not to worry.

453
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,425
Thanks, but I�m not really dressed for a party.

454
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:34,591
Oh, please. We�re not formal here, you look fine.

455
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:35,496
Well...

456
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,857
Mom kind of has plans.

457
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:41,263
Yeah, I got a couple credit cards burning a hole in my wallet.

458
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,350
Oh, go shopping some other time and come play with us. Please?

459
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:46,705
There�s just a bunch of people in there that Rory doesn�t know,

460
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,990
and having you here would make her so much more comfortable.

461
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:51,877
Oh, I don�t mind not knowing anyone at the party, really.

462
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:53,720
That�s nice, honey, but very unconvincing.

463
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,977
Lorelai, I meant to extend the invitation to both of you.

464
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:58,610
I just wasn�t sure if you�d...

465
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:03,694
You know, there�s lots of food, and booze for the lucky non-pregnant ones,

466
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:06,341
- and cake... it�ll be fun. 
- Well...

467
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:09,547
- I�ll block your car with my stomach. 
- No, don�t do that.

468
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,749
- Please, it would mean so much. 
- Well...

469
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:13,817
- Okay, sure. 
- Really?

470
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:16,327
- Yeah, let�s have a party. 
- Yay!

471
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:19,076
Ooh, watch it, you�ll jiggle that thing right out of you.

472
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,759
A mother�s perspective, thanks.

473
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,149
Come in, come in.

474
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,525
- Nice place. 
- Very nice.

475
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,092
It�s a work-in-progress.

476
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,792
It was so bachelor pad before: rock posters, modular furniture, magazines everywhere.

477
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:39,598
I would pick up a TV Guide and it would be three months old.

478
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:41,093
Here�s the gang.

479
00:21:43,754 --> 00:21:47,177
You�ve got Gail, Jody, Maureen, Linda, Susan and Alice.

480
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:50,427
This is Christopher�s daughter, the famous Rory,

481
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:53,581
and I did a little arm twisting and got her mother Lorelai to come in, too.

482
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,004
The more the merrier.

483
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,249
Mojito?

484
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,032
Oh, now that you don�t need to twist my arm for.

485
00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:00,750
You know, Rory and I will be the only ones not imbibing.

486
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,312
- Oh, and G.G. 
- Who?

487
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,620
G.G., short for Georgia. The two Gs.

488
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,092
- That�s cute. 
- So it�s a girl?

489
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,272
Yeah. Christopher would�ve been happy with either,

490
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:10,106
but I really wanted a ballerina.

491
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,758
Oh, ah... what�s this?

492
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:15,134
It�s a little game. Everyone gets a diaper pin,

493
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:18,190
and if you say the word "baby," the person catching you saying it gets to keep your pin.

494
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,320
Maureen�s the instigator of this little soiree.

495
00:22:20,495 --> 00:22:22,113
She has her own publicity firm in New York.

496
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,987
She meant to run all those people down,

497
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:25,092
but you didn�t hear it from me.

498
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:29,696
Oh, look at this � the famous CD collection.

499
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:33,060
- In alphabetical order, too. 
- And not stacked up like coasters.

500
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,887
Yeah, I had to put an end to that. Finding something was impossible.

501
00:22:35,994 --> 00:22:39,784
I would be looking for my Wang Chung or Billy Joel and I would just have to give up.

502
00:22:39,953 --> 00:22:43,331
So now, everything is at your fingertips.  Wang Chung.

503
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:46,342
- Wang Chung. 
- Hey, no sub-groups, Sherry. Get over here.

504
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:48,462
- Mojito? 
- Oh, thank you.

505
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,167
- Club soda? 
- Thank you.

506
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:52,241
- Don�t you hate the way she looks? 
- Who, Sherry?

507
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:54,007
You can only tell she�s pregnant in profile.

508
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:55,826
Nothing in the face, nothing from behind...

509
00:22:55,948 --> 00:22:58,206
- Yeah, Sherry, you look amazing. 
- I do not.

510
00:22:58,313 --> 00:23:01,115
You do. When I was carrying this one, doorways had to be widened.

511
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:02,425
It�s good to have you here, Lorelai.

512
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:04,817
You�re the only one that can give me a motherly perspective.

513
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:07,269
Oh, I�m the only mother here? None of you have kids?

514
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:09,056
- Whose got the time? 
- Or the guy.

515
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:11,140
There aren�t that many Christophers in the world.

516
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:12,901
That�s true.

517
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,535
You have to give me your list of books, okay?

518
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,404
- Books? 
- The ones that you read when you had Rory.

519
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:19,916
Oh, I see. I think I was reading "Deenie" at the time...

520
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:21,646
- No parenting books? 
- No parenting books.

521
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:23,433
Then where�d you get your information on child raising?

522
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,522
- Your mom? 
- No, "For Keeps."

523
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,488
Molly Ringwald, Randall Bantikoff,

524
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:32,630
really underrated little post-John Hughes flick. She went to the prom fat.

525
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,080
I found it really inspirational.

526
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:37,423
Hey, what are we all sitting around here for?

527
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:40,602
- Let the games begin! 
- Let the games begin!

528
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,504
Games?

529
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:42,927
Susan, help me move the couch.

530
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:44,879
- They�re moving the couch. 
- Bless you for being here.

531
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:50,531
Feed the baby! Feed the baby!

532
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:52,103
Go, go!

533
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:53,751
You�ve got twenty seconds!

534
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:22,462
- Horseradish. 
- Write it down, write it down.

535
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,243
Hoping it�s ammonia.

536
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:29,815
You�re not supposed to say. Write it down.

537
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:35,744
Baby crap.

538
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:40,378
One, two, three � pull!

539
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:41,698
- Wow. 
- Loud.

540
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:43,562
Oh, keep opening, keep opening.

541
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,196
You guys got me too much stuff.

542
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,217
You should�ve just chipped in and bought me one thing.

543
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:52,492
Oh, it�s a mobile. I love it, Gail. Thank you.

544
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,643
- Green again. 
- Pretty green, too.

545
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:57,244
Isn�t it supposed to be pink? Pink for a girl?

546
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,496
- Oh, pink�s out. 
- It�s last week.

547
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,596
- It�s in all the magazines. 
- Green�s the new pink.

548
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:03,930
I did not know that. Did you know that?

549
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:04,919
Oh, sure.

550
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:06,480
Hey Sher, let me ask you...

551
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:09,394
how in the world are you gonna finish that Spring campaign you�re working on?

552
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:12,864
Oh, just barely. I have the final presentation on the seventeenth at noon,

553
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,826
which gives me plenty of time to do G.G. at five.

554
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:16,695
- To do G.G? 
- My Cesarean.

555
00:25:17,023 --> 00:25:18,185
I scheduled it months ago.

556
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:20,914
- Didn�t you schedule yours? 
- Not quite.

557
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,140
A half hour before I had Rory, I was eating a pepper sandwich and watching TV.

558
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:26,061
- You were almost named Quincy. 
- Thanks for refraining.

559
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:28,744
Scheduling it like this was beyond necessary.

560
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:30,449
I would die without organization.

561
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:33,218
I mean, which is why I was so thrown off at the beginning.

562
00:25:33,352 --> 00:25:33,991
What do you mean?

563
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,679
Christopher and I didn�t exactly plan for this to happen.

564
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:39,476
I thought I had the flu or something. When I finally went to the doctor

565
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:41,319
and he told me, he had to pick me up off the floor.

566
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,760
Okay, I�m drunk, which is why I�m telling you

567
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,107
that we were very shocked when you told us because

568
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:49,025
- you are so not a baby person. 
- Oh, I�m still not.

569
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:51,606
I mean, she�s all mine when she�s got the legs to dance,

570
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:54,181
- but Christopher�s the baby person. 
- She�s going to be beautiful.

571
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:57,126
Yeah, you and Christopher are like a poster for Aryan breeding.

572
00:25:57,295 --> 00:25:59,793
Well, I can only hope that G.G.�s as beautiful as Rory.

573
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:02,009
And half as smart, too. She�s going to Harvard, you know.

574
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,642
- Wow, really? 
- I�m not in yet. I�ve just applied.

575
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:06,921
Oh, she�s as good as in. I�m not just saying that.

576
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:10,296
I can also sign it, mime it, Morse code it, and do an interpretive dance to it.

577
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,163
- It�s gonna be Harvard. 
- Well, I certainly hope so.

578
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,416
- It�s just minutes from here. Did you know that? 
- Minutes, really?

579
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:17,756
I�ve already clocked it � two point seven miles, which is nothing.

580
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:19,922
I�ve already checked out the best late afternoon route

581
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:22,574
- for her to take to come over after classes. 
- To come over here?

582
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:24,570
Well, your little sister�s going to demand it.

583
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:27,612
- You can even sleep over if you want. 
- Oh, I�ll have a dorm room.

584
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,060
I know, but dorm rooms are awful.

585
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,745
You can even spend the weekends, too.

586
00:26:30,926 --> 00:26:33,224
Right � the ones she�s not visiting me on.

587
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:34,682
Oh, that�s a given Lorelai.

588
00:26:34,872 --> 00:26:36,557
Really, anytime. We�ve already for a key for you.

589
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:38,447
Well, thank you. I�ll definitely visit.

590
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,843
You too, Lorelai. I mean, you�re sort of G.G.�s aunt.

591
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,116
Oh, I guess I kind of am.

592
00:26:43,264 --> 00:26:44,664
I�m gonna get some more potato salad. Excuse me.

593
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:46,802
Isn�t it the best? I�m think I�m gonna get some more, too.

594
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,396
- No, no, let me get it. 
- No, no, no... it�s okay.

595
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,283
I can�t believe my appetite.

596
00:26:55,662 --> 00:26:57,259
It�s so weird what a baby does to you.

597
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:59,108
Well, you�ve got a lifetime to get back at �em.

598
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:01,212
Right. Thanks for that.

599
00:27:01,448 --> 00:27:03,040
- I�m glad you�re here. 
- Good.

600
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,709
Chris would be happy you�re here, too.

601
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:06,311
Oh, great.

602
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,890
I have to tell you, he has been so amazing the past few months,

603
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,655
- so involved with the baby. 
- Good, good.

604
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:16,481
Wow, you�d think those things would be against the law or something.

605
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,734
- He talks to it every night. 
- Who?

606
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:19,983
Christopher. To the baby.

607
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:21,913
- He sings, too. 
- That�s nice.

608
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:24,152
He has a terrible voice, but it�s sweet.

609
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:28,385
And he�s so protective. If he was here right now, he would insist that I lie down.

610
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,972
I keep kidding him that one of these days he�s gonna come home

611
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:34,391
with one of those sofas with the pole and the four men to carry me around everywhere.

612
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,840
Well, if you turn it down, feel free to send it to my house.

613
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,869
She get a bulk rate on those things or what?

614
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,963
You know, when I first found out I was pregnant,

615
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:44,960
I wasn�t quite sure how Christopher would handle it,

616
00:27:45,092 --> 00:27:48,304
but I just never expected it would be like this. He�s been unbelievable.

617
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,355
That�s great, Sherry, really.

618
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,479
Yeah, well, I wanted to thank you.

619
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:54,402
Thank me?

620
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:55,938
Yeah. I mean, it�s all because of you.

621
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:56,773
What?

622
00:27:56,952 --> 00:27:59,052
Yeah, I�ve been wanting to tell you, actually.

623
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:02,246
Chris and I had a rocky stretch. I thought for sure he was out the door.

624
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:04,687
I mean, he was so distant and hardly ever talked.

625
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:06,895
I wasn�t even sure if I was gonna tell him about the baby.

626
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:10,121
I thought I was gonna either go it alone, or not go through with it at all.

627
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,337
I mean, I was kind of in the same position that you were in when you were pregnant,

628
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:15,108
- do you know what I mean? 
-  Yeah, I guess.

629
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:17,597
I decided that I would tell him before I made any decisions,

630
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,432
and that was the weekend he was with you and Rory, remember?

631
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:23,291
- There was a wedding or something... 
- Yes, I remember.

632
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:26,383
Well, I don�t know what happened or what you said,

633
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:29,881
but whatever it was, it worked. He came back a changed man.

634
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:34,160
All of a sudden, he was so attentive and devoted, and so willing to make it work.

635
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:37,739
He said that he�d missed out before, and he didn�t want to miss it again.

636
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,792
And I just credit a good portion of that to you.

637
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:43,895
Yes, well, I can be very persuasive.

638
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:47,443
- God, I�m getting to hate those things. 
- Guys, cool it with the poppers.

639
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:49,256
- Party pooper. 
- Popper pooper.

640
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,070
They�re children. Are you okay?

641
00:28:53,183 --> 00:28:56,331
Yeah, I�m fine, It was just one hell of a Mojito.

642
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:58,160
Listen, could you point the way to the bathroom?

643
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,782
Oh, sure. Just through there and to the right.

644
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,617
Thanks.

645
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:34,242
- Just a minute. 
- It�s me.

646
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:35,312
Come in.

647
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:36,828
- Hi. 
- Hi there.

648
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,293
- Are you okay? 
- I�ve been better.

649
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:40,570
You rearranged her medicine cabinet?

650
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:42,363
Yes, and it�s going to rock her world.

651
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,095
- Are you having a meltdown? 
- Pretty much.

652
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:46,367
- From something that Sherry said? 
- From everything Sherry said.

653
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:48,533
- About my visiting her? 
- Okay, sure, we�ll start there.

654
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:51,376
As if you�re gonna have all this free time to pal around with her.

655
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,223
You�ll be in classes, does she know that?

656
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,185
She was just asking.

657
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,295
And what are you doing agreeing to come over here all the time?

658
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:57,376
I was just being polite.

659
00:29:57,515 --> 00:29:59,081
By agreeing to be here every weekend you�re not with me?

660
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:00,090
I did not agree to that.

661
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:01,457
You�re spending all your weekends with me.

662
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:03,505
That�s a given. And she had to have a girl.

663
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:05,462
- That kills me! 
- That her baby�s a girl?

664
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:08,819
Yes, because I have a girl. She�s just a copycat.

665
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:10,403
She can�t control the sex of her baby.

666
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,597
Oh, really? Little Miss "Mani-pedi-I�ll-give-birth-before-five-o�clock"?

667
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,189
- I think she can. 
- Mom...

668
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:16,266
"All I want�s a ballerina."

669
00:30:16,546 --> 00:30:18,943
Poor thing�s gonna pop out of her womb and land in a tutu.

670
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,853
- Boy, I hope not. 
- And what is with that name...

671
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,281
- G.G.? 
- It�s a cute name.

672
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:24,749
It is, �cause she�s copying me there, too.

673
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:27,038
Rory, G.G. Rory, G.G.

674
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:29,613
- They�re identical. 
- They are not identical.

675
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:31,620
Two syllables, repeating consonants.

676
00:30:31,856 --> 00:30:34,166
- Rory... G.G. 
- Oprah, Uma.

677
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,730
- Don�t mock. 
- I�m just trying to joke you down off that ledge.

678
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:38,459
And that music, God, that music!

679
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:40,862
Yeah, I�m with you on that. The music�s driving me crazy, too.

680
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:44,340
I mean, they�ve been playing the same nondescript, soft, generic jazz

681
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,208
for two straight hours.

682
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:48,349
And who is that playing that stupid saxophone like that?

683
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:49,808
It�s music you eat brunch to.

684
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,519
Thank you for finally being on my side for something.

685
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:52,736
Mom, I�m always on your side.

686
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:54,335
She probably makes Christopher listen to that garbage.

687
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,505
And... then there�s the whole thing of rearranging his CDs.

688
00:30:57,602 --> 00:31:01,901
I mean, to her they�re just identical little metal discs full of annoying sounds

689
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:04,023
that you alphabetize like files in an office.

690
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,142
I�m with you on that, but you�ve got to calm down.

691
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,108
I just wanna rearrange her whole house.

692
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:09,429
- You can�t do that. 
- Please?

693
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:11,314
Let me just mess up her bed.

694
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:13,357
You make a distraction, like setting a fire,

695
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:15,565
and I�ll run up and un-color-coordinate her sheets.

696
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:17,831
I think the fire would be the thing that she�d remember.

697
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,141
I could�ve been shopping. I could�ve been out buying shoes

698
00:31:20,249 --> 00:31:24,125
I�ll never wear. And all that stuff about me and thanking me and...

699
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:25,277
- What? 
- Nothing.

700
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:30,218
I know you�re always on my side.

701
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:31,626
- It�s okay. 
- I�m sorry.

702
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:32,896
It�s okay. We should probably get back.

703
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:34,637
Yeah, probably.

704
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:39,163
I�m gonna take one of Maureen�s little poppers and pop her right up her...

705
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,228
- Mom... 
- Okay, let�s go.

706
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:43,483
Just... green�s the new pink?

707
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,272
- Mom. 
- Come on.

708
00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:46,501
- It�s stupid. 
- Thank you.

709
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:47,371
Let�s go.

710
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:56,509
Hey, I got dinner. Half an apple pie, too.

711
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:59,732
Told the last couple people that wanted some that a fly landed in it.

712
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,457
Why are you going through my stuff?

713
00:32:01,574 --> 00:32:04,242
- Why are you going through all my stuff? 
- I�m not.

714
00:32:04,318 --> 00:32:06,428
- So someone else is? 
- I�m not going through your stuff.

715
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,109
- You suck at lying. 
- You�re paranoid.

716
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:09,926
Fine, I�m being paranoid, but that doesn�t mean

717
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:11,584
- you�re not going through my stuff. 
- Get the forks.

718
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:14,165
Practically everything I own is in a slightly different place

719
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:16,879
than when I saw it last. Now why are you going through my stuff?

720
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,765
- For your own good. 
- My own good?

721
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:22,343
- Can we be a little more Totalitarian here? 
- Hey, how �bout I ask a question, Jess?

722
00:32:22,803 --> 00:32:24,999
- If it has to do with this, be my guest. 
- Where�d you get the money for the car?

723
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:25,706
- What? 
- The car.

724
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,755
- Where�d you get the money? 
- I told you, I worked for it.

725
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:28,815
I know what I pay you.

726
00:32:29,004 --> 00:32:31,406
Okay, well, I do jobs around town.

727
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:33,197
- What jobs? 
- I clean rain gutters.

728
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:36,320
Jess, if you cleaned every rain gutter from here to Vermont,

729
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:38,041
you wouldn�t have enough money to buy that car.

730
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,582
Now tell me where you got the money.

731
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:42,409
I�m not just doing rain gutters when I�m not working at the diner.

732
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:43,428
What are you doing?

733
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:47,606
I go to a... a place that gives me money.

734
00:32:47,694 --> 00:32:49,735
- For what? 
- For my services.

735
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:51,478
What services? What place?

736
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:55,737
- Jess, are you a gigolo? 
- What?

737
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:58,400
Well, I don�t know. You say you go to a place where they give you money...

738
00:32:58,502 --> 00:32:59,194
- I do. 
- Where?

739
00:32:59,362 --> 00:33:02,235
- Wal-Mart. 
- Excuse me?

740
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:04,800
I�ve been working there twelve hours a week for the past few months

741
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,546
- to get extra money for the car. 
- Wal-Mart.

742
00:33:06,658 --> 00:33:07,841
You work at Wal-Mart?

743
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,783
I cannot picture you working at Wal-Mart.

744
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:14,953
Oh my God, you work at Wal-Mart.

745
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,642
- Let�s drop this now. 
- Yeah, sure, fine.

746
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:19,986
You�re not the guy that greets people at the door, are you?

747
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,974
- We were dropping this. 
- Come on.

748
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:24,432
I work in the back. I move stock around on a forklift.

749
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,014
That takes a special license, doesn�t it?

750
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,519
I spent a Saturday afternoon taking the class

751
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,397
and I got it like that, no biggie. 

752
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,910
- We done here? 
- Yeah.

753
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:36,526
- You wear a vest and everything? 
- It�s the uniform, I have to.

754
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,461
You�ve been sneaking out of here with a little vest hidden on you?

755
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:40,152
- It�s not a little vest. 
- Is it blue?

756
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:42,578
Will you stop talking about the vest?

757
00:33:42,665 --> 00:33:43,658
Do you get a store discount?

758
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:47,648
Fifteen percent. And if you want fifteen percent off anything,

759
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,435
you�re not gonna get it �cause you�re being a jerk.

760
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:52,445
- My enjoyment is worth the loss. 
- I�m eating and ignoring you.

761
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:54,427
You�re like the all-American boy.

762
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:56,773
- Call me Dirk Squarejaw. 
- Look at you.

763
00:33:57,023 --> 00:33:58,328
- What? 
- Eating apple pie.

764
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,498
I�m outta here.

765
00:34:01,574 --> 00:34:04,405
Hey, wave a flag and sing "God Bless America", please?

766
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,287
Goodbye.

767
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:06,751
You�re okay to drive, right?

768
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:08,303
I barely drank a thing.

769
00:34:08,441 --> 00:34:10,591
- I�m talking about your mood. 
- My mood is fine.

770
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:13,741
- You�re still mad at Sherry. 
- No, I�m fine, and I�m fine to drive.

771
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:18,548
Although sometimes, when I�m driving and it�s dark like this,

772
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:21,396
I get the sudden urge to turn the wheel into oncoming traffic.

773
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:23,557
No, do not do Duane from "Annie Hall!"

774
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:25,287
I can see the flames, I can smell the smoke...

775
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:27,678
- I hate this bit. 
- Okay, I�m creeping me out, too.

776
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,601
Move those things, will you? They�re not the most fragrant food in the world.

777
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:31,912
We shouldn�t have taken them.

778
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,955
- We had no choice. 
- She was insistent.

779
00:34:34,063 --> 00:34:36,782
"Take the deviled eggs!" How many times did the woman say it?

780
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,079
And then her drunken friends hear it and they�re all shouting, "Take the deviled eggs!"

781
00:34:40,192 --> 00:34:42,727
Every one of those ladies was slobbering drunk.

782
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,934
Maureen and Susan almost coming to blows was worth it, though.

783
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:46,782
- How did that happen, anyway? 
- From what I can tell,

784
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:50,560
Susan said, "Bla ra um beh bleh,"

785
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,941
- and Maureen took great offense. 
- Well, yeah.

786
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:54,749
You know, we didn�t have to stay that long.

787
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:56,639
Not according to Sherry.

788
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:59,003
She made a very persuasive argument that if we left at six,

789
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:01,052
there�d be an extra hour of sitting in traffic,

790
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:04,216
so by leaving at seven we�d get home at the same time as leaving at six.

791
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:07,047
She�s very up on traffic flow and rush hour and all that.

792
00:35:07,152 --> 00:35:08,389
She�s Rand McNally.

793
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:10,459
She should do traffic reports on the radio.

794
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:14,145
"Hi, this is Sherry Tinsdale. Looks like there�s a tie-up on the boulevard.

795
00:35:14,268 --> 00:35:16,761
They appear to be moving every building in Harvard University

796
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,302
so now it�s just one point three miles from my house.

797
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:21,247
- Nice job, guys." 
- You�re awful.

798
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:24,555
"Oh, and lots of cars stopped at a blue light on Garvey Avenue.

799
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:26,967
Why a blue light? Well, �cause blue�s the new red."

800
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:28,287
I like that you�re feeling better.

801
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,294
I�m not feeling better. I�m still... grrr!

802
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,054
- That medicine cabinet was not enough. 
- Mom.

803
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,341
It was tame, and any one of those drunken yuppies could have messed it up.

804
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:38,451
They wouldn�t dare.

805
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:41,350
Plus, when I went back in there, I cleaned it up.

806
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,466
Rory!

807
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:44,964
- Let it go. 
- That was my catharsis.

808
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:46,030
Let it go.

809
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,714
No, that woman does something to me.

810
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,399
You�ve got to live and let live.

811
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:50,746
And bringing up Christopher like that...

812
00:35:50,853 --> 00:35:53,346
- she must know what she�s doing. 
- I�m not sure she did.

813
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,129
I almost wish she was doing all this on purpose.

814
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:57,432
- I would respect her more. 
- I just hope Dad�s happy.

815
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,157
Happy? With Sherry and G.G., the five o�clock ballerina?

816
00:36:00,306 --> 00:36:03,972
No way. And to think that I sent him back to her a new man?

817
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:05,128
Man!

818
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:08,862
- Stop the car. 
- What? Why?

819
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:11,565
- You want catharsis? 
- Yes.

820
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,218
- I know what�ll do it for you. 
- What?

821
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:14,580
Jess� car.

822
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,449
- What? 
- We egg Jess� car.

823
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:19,050
- It�s perfect. 
- Are you serious?

824
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:20,971
No one�s around, and it�s just sitting there.

825
00:36:21,227 --> 00:36:23,628
Rory, if rearranging Sherry�s medicine cabinet is immature,

826
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:24,950
- what�s this? 
- Off the chart.

827
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:26,812
- We can�t egg his car. 
- Sure we can.

828
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,261
Doose�s is closed and we don�t have any eggs at home.

829
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:33,372
You want to devil-egg Jess� car?

830
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:37,218
And how is that gonna make me feel better about Sherry?

831
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:39,441
Because it�s active! It�s aggressive!

832
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,576
It�s destructive, but not too destructive!

833
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,623
I don�t know... can you make something up?

834
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,881
- Let�s do it. 
- Leave the engine running.

835
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:46,680
Good thinking.

836
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:53,567
You first.

837
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,882
- Wow, nice. 
- It made a good sound, too.

838
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:00,182
- How�d it feel? 
- Fantastic.

839
00:37:00,992 --> 00:37:03,152
- You�re right, that�s good. 
- Fun, huh?

840
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,609
I don�t think there�s been a better use of deviled eggs in culinary history.

841
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:11,473
- That�s it? 
- All out.

842
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:13,669
Damn that Sherry for not sending more home with us!

843
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:15,297
- Don�t lose your catharsis. 
- Right, sorry.

844
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:16,347
- Wait... 
- What?

845
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,737
- Is that a siren? 
- I don�t hear anything.

846
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,862
Neither do I. It just seemed a cool thing to say at that moment.

847
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:22,721
It was.

848
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:25,687
Hey, let�s run back and speed off like we did something really awful

849
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:26,930
- and the cops are after us! 
- Run!

850
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:31,375
Be prepared �cause I am gonna squeal out of here!

851
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:32,246
Go!

852
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,418
Try again, try again.

853
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,697
- We�ll just make the noise ourselves. 
- Good deal.

854
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,720
- I wonder if he�s seen it yet. 
- Doesn�t look like it.

855
00:37:58,456 --> 00:37:59,833
Maybe we should�ve headed for the border.

856
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:00,541
Which border?

857
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,249
The one between America and Sephoraland?

858
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:04,075
- Hey Luke. 
- Hi.

859
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:05,595
Just seeing what the mob scene is.

860
00:38:05,723 --> 00:38:07,140
- The protest! 
- We almost forgot!

861
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:07,996
Come on!

862
00:38:12,127 --> 00:38:13,253
So it�s the big day, huh?

863
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,892
Oh, it�s supposed to happen any minute.

864
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:17,335
- Goody. 
- This is hardly a goody, young lady.

865
00:38:17,468 --> 00:38:19,000
Are you locked and loaded, Officer?

866
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:20,556
I�m a tiger ready to pounce, Taylor.

867
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:22,307
What�s with having the law here, Taylor?

868
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:25,676
Yeah, Taylor, this protest is gonna be very mellow, very peaceful.

869
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:28,251
You can hang out in Haight-Ashbury

870
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:30,703
and drink as much electric Kool-Aid as you want, Babette,

871
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:32,772
- but I�m preparing for the worst. 
- There he is.

872
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:35,174
- What�s he carrying? 
- Something all rolled up.

873
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:37,293
- Probably a body. 
- It looks heavy, too.

874
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:39,183
- Bodies are heavy. 
- That�s not funny.

875
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:40,613
Somebody should give him a hand.

876
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:41,892
Oh, here comes someone.

877
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:44,462
Oh, guess he doesn�t want help.

878
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:46,224
There�s a reason his name isn�t Town Gregarious Guy.

879
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:48,251
- Very true. 
- Do you even have bullets in that thing?

880
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:49,895
Oh yeah, I�m ready to pop some caps here.

881
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:51,687
There he goes.

882
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:53,925
Well, this is a very nice protest so far.

883
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:55,189
One of the best I�ve ever been to.

884
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,992
It�s fun seeing everybody like this.

885
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:58,242
We see each other every day.

886
00:38:58,348 --> 00:38:59,905
But we don�t all stand around in a clump like this.

887
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:01,241
- True. 
- We should have brought food.

888
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:03,279
Well, we�ll know better next time.

889
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,080
- There he is again. 
- It�s a banner.

890
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,733
Probably laced with obscenity.

891
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:09,491
- He�s dropping it! 
- This is exciting!

892
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,288
- It�s blank. 
- It�s the wrong side.

893
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:15,383
Turn it over!

894
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,079
Did anyone see what it said?

895
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:23,127
Just the flash of a word. It started with an "R."

896
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,659
All right, then all we have to do is think of everything

897
00:39:26,752 --> 00:39:28,574
that someone could protest that starts with an "R",

898
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:29,879
and then we�ll know what he�s protesting.

899
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,199
- Ragu. 
- Ragu, yes, he could be protesting Ragu.

900
00:39:32,394 --> 00:39:33,864
- Reptiles. 
- That�s another.

901
00:39:33,952 --> 00:39:34,898
- Robots. 
- Could be.

902
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:37,114
Ix crosti sonnicello.

903
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:39,598
- What did he say? 
- His diction�s terrible.

904
00:39:39,707 --> 00:39:41,642
I heard Jello, something about Jello.

905
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:43,643
Well, is he for Jello or against Jello?

906
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:46,194
- It�s not clear. 
- Dopbanoodlestooz!

907
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:48,734
That was clearer. He said, "Stop the noodle scooz."

908
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:50,945
- Stop the noodle scooz? 
- That�s not even English.

909
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:52,880
And what does it have to do with Jello?

910
00:39:52,987 --> 00:39:54,754
I heard "Drop the student schools."

911
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:55,748
That must be it.

912
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:57,269
No, but that doesn�t make any sense either.

913
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:00,939
Look, now we have to stop this.

914
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:03,874
He could be saying horrible things, blasphemous things.

915
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:04,940
But how would you know?

916
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:06,747
Yeah, what�s the harm if we can�t even understand what he�s saying?

917
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:08,314
Hey, maybe that�s the Town Loner�s point.

918
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,900
That, like, he�s protesting man�s inability to communicate

919
00:40:11,018 --> 00:40:14,044
by not communicating and getting us all to talk about communication.

920
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:15,734
Whoa, you are blowin� my mind here.

921
00:40:15,857 --> 00:40:16,794
I�m seeing trails.

922
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:22,043
Luke!

923
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:28,238
- Did you see this? 
- See what?

924
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:29,277
What happened?

925
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,060
- Someone egged my car. 
- Geez, it stinks.

926
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,002
It�s gonna take me forever to clean this up.

927
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:36,266
- These eggs are cooked. 
- What?

928
00:40:36,338 --> 00:40:38,458
They�re not raw eggs. They look like... deviled eggs.

929
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,428
- Someone devil-egged my car? 
- Well, that is paprika.

930
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:44,268
Someone prepared deviled eggs to throw at my car?

931
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:45,739
Man, they must hate you a lot.

932
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:47,624
Maybe it was the guy in the garden department.

933
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:49,482
I�m gonna go get something to clean this up.

934
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,899
Or maybe it was the assistant night manager.

935
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:52,799
You guys have words in the snack room?

936
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:55,959
First protest, now vandalism.

937
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:57,531
Makes you think about leaving this town.

938
00:40:57,745 --> 00:40:59,108
I never wanna leave this town.

939
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:00,921
Oop, guess he�s giving up.

940
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:04,069
It�s back to the hills, Town Loner, to protest another day.

941
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:07,326
He doesn�t litter. That�s nice.

942
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,749
- He looks so sad. 
- He�ll be fine.

943
00:41:09,923 --> 00:41:11,540
Mrs. Town Loner will cheer him up.

944
00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:14,909
Whew. Let�s get upwind from Jess� car.

945
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:23,312
- Breakfast? 
- Anything but eggs.

946
00:41:24,812 --> 00:41:26,363
I was home all night last night.

947
00:41:26,696 --> 00:41:29,641
So was I. We have alibis and everything.
