1
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:31,051
You are hilarious!

2
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:39,167
Okay, see, last night, when I said to you, �Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I get up at seven,

3
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:44,421
what I actually meant was, �Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I have the option of getting up at seven

4
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:49,091
in case when seven comes, I actually wanna get up,� which � as it happened � I didn�t.

5
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:53,017
Therefore, you�re currently responsible for the great alarm clock slaughter of 2002.

6
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:53,711
No survivors? 

6
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:56,811
The one shaped like a bunny escaped with a mild decapitation.

7
00:00:58,211 --> 00:00:59,975
- This is decaf. 
- What are you talking about?

8
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,337
- You switched my coffee again. 
- I�m a busy man.

9
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:06,808
I don�t have time to sneak around switching your coffee. I have a diner to run, I have shipments to order,

10
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:09,270
I have things to flip and fry. Will you stop that?

11
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:15,226
Under the sink, very clever, but not clever enough bucko.

12
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,451
Okay, fine, you know what? I give up.

13
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,837
- Go one day without coffee. 
- That�s not giving up.

14
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:23,099
- I�ll put a toy in your cereal. 
- Dirty!

15
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,133
- Fine, here, you win. 
- Thank you.

16
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:27,007
You�re welcome. Now you�re up, you�re fed, I�m leaving. 

16
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:28,747
Oh, hey, we need q-tips.

17
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:31,860
- I�ll alert the media. 
- See, that�s better with the accent.

18
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:36,402
The reference is enough, you�ll learn that one day. I�ll be home early, anything besides the q-tips?

19
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:40,253
Cotton balls, world peace, Connie Chung�s original face back.

20
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:42,556
Goodbye crazy lady.

21
00:01:43,248 --> 00:01:45,501
- Goodbye Sid and Nancy. 
- Leopold and Loeb.

22
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,252
- What? 
- I changed my mind, don�t tell Rory.

23
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:48,481
- Decaf. 
- Never.

24
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:50,723
- They�ll both have two heads. 
- More to love.

25
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:18,020
- Hello? 
- You have to come home.

26
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,002
- Mom? 
- You�re gone and the house is quiet 

27
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:24,018
and Bill Maher�s canceled. The name of the show was Politically Incorrect for God�s sake. 

28
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:27,034
Didn�t anybody read the title? He was supposed to say those things, dammit! 

29
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:28,916
- You had another dream.
- Yes.

30
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:32,946
- The doctor is in.
- Okay, I�m lying in bed and I�m sleeping 

31
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:37,359
and I�m wearing this fabulous nightgown, and like thirty alarm clocks go off, 

32
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:46,489
and so I get out of bed and I walk downstairs, and there, standing is the kitchen, is Luke!

33
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:50,704
- Was he naked? 
- No! He was making breakfast.

34
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,921
- Naked? 
- Okay, you�ve been in Washington way too long.

35
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:56,534
- Sorry. Go ahead, he was making breakfast... 
- Eggs and pancakes and bacon,

36
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:59,700
and he put decaf coffee in my regular coffee bag, which of course I knew immediately.

37
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,251
- Hi, the nose. 
- Exactly.

38
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:06,817
So eventually I find the real stuff under the sink. He hands me my breakfast, and then...

39
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:07,702
What?

40
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:13,110
He kissed me and talked to my stomach!

41
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:16,786
- Why would he do that? 
- Because apparently I�m pregnant!

42
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,399
- What? 
- With twins!

43
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:24,555
- Say something. 
- You are going to be so fat.

44
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:28,486
- Just analyze my dream, please. 
- Okay. Well, your dream was telling you

45
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:31,553
that you are secretly in love with Luke and you wanna marry him and have his twins.

46
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:33,833
- No, try again. 
- What do you mean, try again?

47
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,794
You asked me to analyze your dream, I analyzed your dream.

48
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:38,805
Yes, well, I reject that analysis, so I�d like another one, please.

49
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:42,686
You can�t just reject an analysis and try again. You�re not shopping for bathing suits here.

50
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:47,201
Give me another analysis or I�ll put your Taylor hula-hooping dream into a whole other context.

51
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:51,415
I told you, Taylor was supposed to be Dean. I could tell by his freakishly thick head of hair.

52
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:52,342
I�m waiting.

53
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,115
Okay, maybe you�re still upset about what happened with Dad

54
00:03:57,207 --> 00:04:01,037
and you�re jealous of Sherry because she�s having his baby and not you.

55
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:03,571
Mom?

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,598
- I miss you. 
- I miss you, too.

57
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,704
Woodward... Bernstein... Harry Thomason.

58
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:11,950
Is that Paris? 

58
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:15,650
Yeah, she talks in her sleep... long in-depth arguments.

59
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:18,390
- I�m so glad I only have one more day here. 
- Me, too.

60
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:21,298
What do you have on your agenda for tomorrow? Or, today, actually.

61
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:25,169
We have a breakfast mixer with members of Congress and the Senate.

62
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:27,893
Cool. See if you can steal me something off of Tom Daschle�s fruit plate.

63
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,147
- I�ll see what I can do. 
- See you Friday, doc.

64
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:31,185
See you Friday.

65
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,600
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

66
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:12,265
- No way. 
- I swear.

67
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:14,667
- Kosher bacon. 
- Beef not pork.

68
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:17,171
- I am so Jewish. 
- Hey Sookie, where�s my...

69
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:19,932
- Jackson, hold on! Lorelai�s here! 
- Oh, Jackson, I�m in the kitchen!

70
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:23,586
- I�m eating bacon, so don�t... ahhhhh! 
- Will you stop it? I�m dressed.

71
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:26,679
Well, how do I know you weren�t showering and the hot water went out

72
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:29,798
and you rushed down here with nothing but a teeny tiny towel in front of ya.

73
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:32,326
- Once, that happened once. 
- Well, once was enough.

74
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,629
Oh, hey, honey, I got those paint chips that we were talking about.

75
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,705
- Do you wanna look at them now? 
- Nope.

76
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:39,778
But it�ll only take a minute and I actually went though and picked out a couple of colors for you.

77
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:40,874
- What are you painting? 
- Nothing.

78
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:42,024
- The house. 
- The whole house?

79
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:43,018
- No. 
- Just the inside.

80
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,548
Ah, that�s a pretty big undertaking. 

80
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,248
It�s not such a big undertaking since we�re not undertaking it.

81
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,863
- I know, but it�ll be fun. 
- Rory and I�ll help if you want.

82
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:53,172
Okay, if you�re gonna come over here everyday, you have to actually hear both of us.

83
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:56,704
Oh. Well, tell me why you�re not painting just the inside of the house?

84
00:06:56,813 --> 00:07:00,924
Because it was my house and now it�s our house and I want it to feel like our house.

85
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:05,318
- I�m totally happy with the way this house feels. 
- How can you be? There�s flowers everywhere.

86
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:08,354
- I like flowers... I�m a produce guy. 
- The curtains are ruffly.

87
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,325
- I like ruffles. 
- How can you like ruffles?

88
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:13,316
- Because I�m very, very gay. 
- Jackson!

89
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:15,753
Judy, Vincent has to go to work now. Goodbye Lorelai.

90
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:19,603
- Tell her I�m fine, I like things just the way they are. 
- I�ll try.

91
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,025
All right, I�ve only got a minute and then I have to leave.

92
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:23,802
- Is there any more bacon? 
- Have mine.

93
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,790
What do you think about mahogany for the living room 

93
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:29,490
and then midnight blue for the hallway and the bedroom?

94
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,260
Sookie, Jackson just said he�s fine with how everything is. I don�t think it�s bugging him.

95
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:37,555
Well, he may not think so now but it�ll bug him eventually and then he�ll resent this place

96
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:40,975
and me by extension and I would like to avoid that. And I can �

97
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:44,023
I just need to butch the place up a little. Now, help me pick a color.

98
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,788
- Okay, I can�t now, but I�ll do it later. 
- Okay.

99
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:49,239
Thanks for breakfast, it was amazing, I love you, I love the bacon.

100
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:54,258
Hey, bacon�s manly. Why don�t you just nail a bunch of packages of Kosher bacon on the walls?

101
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:55,900
Smells like meat blessed by a rabbi � 

101
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:58,200
- now that�s a manly house. 
- Bye-bye.

102
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:01,022
Okay, but if you�re still thinking paint, you�re still thinking like a chick.

103
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:08,286
Watch those streamers! And not too much red near that tree � light touch, light touch, light touch.

104
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,673
- Hey Taylor, how�s the leg? 
- It�s just fine.

105
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,136
Still haven�t found out who put that banana peel on your doorstep, huh?

106
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:15,185
No, but I have a list of suspects.

107
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,647
Hey, what�s all this for?

108
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:22,477
This, young lady, is for the first annual Stars Hollow End of Summer Madness Festival.

109
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:25,076
You finally found a way to fill September, didn�t ya?

110
00:08:25,164 --> 00:08:29,491
This is gonna be a very exciting day. I�m really gonna go all out for this. I even think you�ll be impressed.

111
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,903
- Really, even me? 
- Yes-sir-ee, mini-me,

112
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:39,440
I did not put the word madness in the title for nothing. This place is gonna be crazy, wild � food, games,

113
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,826
we�ve even got a band coming all the way from New York! 

114
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,367
- New York, that�s just nuts!
- And wait �til you see the banner I ordered.

115
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:49,798
It�s gonna make every other banner we�ve ever had look downright embarrassing.

116
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:52,163
- Taylor, you�re on fire. 
- Oh, I love this banner!

117
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:54,206
- I can�t wait to see it. 
- Well, come on Friday.

118
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:58,640
Excuse me... young lady... young lady? You know I�m talking to you.

119
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:02,113
The blonde woman with the ribbons, please slow down.

120
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:05,946
I�m in a wheelchair, young lady, I can�t run after you.

121
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,586
I mean, come on, Senator Boxer, as one of our foremost Democratic leaders, I ask you �

122
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:15,006
do you really think it looks good to have the American Secretary of the Treasury traveling around with Bono?

123
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:19,496
I mean, I know apparently he�s a saint, he�s going to save the world, yada, yada, yada, but my God!

124
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:23,106
He never even takes the sunglasses off. We have an image to maintain, don�t we?

125
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:26,015
I mean, aren�t we at least trying to pretend we�re the superpower in this world?

126
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:29,732
I mean, why not just send Carson Daly over to the Middle East next time Cheney goes, huh?

127
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:33,142
Or hey, hook up Freddie Prinze Jr. with Colin Powell next time he meets with NATO.

128
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:36,467
- I mean, hell! Let�s hear what Freddie has to say, right? 
- Oh, great, Doug.

129
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,929
Paris, do you know Republican Congressman Doug Ose from California?

130
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,898
You don�t? Great. You two will have so much to talk about. Bye.

131
00:09:45,722 --> 00:09:48,226
- Barbara� 
- Ose, right?

132
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:49,932
- Yes that�s right. 
- Let�s take a walk.

133
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:54,319
- Last day here. 
- Yup.

134
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:58,549
- So, in your opinion, how was our nation�s capital? 
- Well, I got to see Archie Bunker�s chair

135
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,109
at the Smithsonian Museum, so it was a big thumbs up for me.

136
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,885
Yes, there are times when this country�s priorities are exactly right.

137
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,830
- So, where�s Paris? 
- Not quite sure.

138
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:10,684
Last time I saw her, she was beating the will to live out of our nation�s representatives.

139
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:13,704
- She is a hammer, isn�t she? 
- Actually, she�s the entire toolbox.

140
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:17,720
Damn. I always seem to catch the most interesting politicians right when they have to use the bathroom.

141
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,318
- Hey Jamie. 
- Paris.

142
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:23,044
Just came over to let you know I got a little sneak peak at the final debate pairings for today.

143
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:25,066
It seems like you and I are going to be on the same side this time. 

144
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:27,991
You�re kidding? You�d think they�d like to give someone else a fighting chance for once.

145
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,808
- Apparently not. 
- God, I love this.

146
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,483
You don�t realize how unqualified most of America�s youth is until

147
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:35,963
you gather them all up in a room and make them speak. So, who are we up against?

148
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:40,315
- Jason Roundsevault and Ty Fredericks. 
- Perfect. Jason�s got asthma and Ty cries.

149
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:43,603
Okay, so we should meet early and go over strategy, make sure you bought enough Kleenex.

150
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,101
Good, good. 

150
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:46,501
And then tonight we should get together and celebrate over dinner.

151
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:48,641
- What if we don�t win? 
- Don�t lose it on me now.

152
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:49,706
- You�re right. 
- So, dinner?

153
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:51,918
- Sure. 
- Good, I�ll swing around for you about seven.

154
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,988
- Fine. 
- Okay, see you at the slaughter.

155
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,329
Yeah, can you imagine pairing me with Jamie?

156
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:02,564
I mean, why not just line the hallways with self esteem counselors right now.

157
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:04,223
- Paris? 
- What?

158
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,817
What do you mean what? He just asked you out on a date. 

158
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,817
He did not.

159
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:11,734
- Yes, he did. You�re having dinner with Jamie tonight. 
- It�s a victory dinner, that�s it.

160
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:15,630
Paris, if he just wanted to celebrate winning a debate, you guys could�ve had coffee afterward,

161
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:17,285
but he asked you out on a date.

162
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,312
- He did? 
- Yes.

163
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,537
- Did I accept? 
- Yes.

164
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:22,790
- I�m going on a date? 
- Yes, you are.

165
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:26,967
Oh man, I can�t believe this! I finally get asked out on a date and I missed it?

166
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:29,880
- Was it a good ask-out? 
- It was a very good ask-out.

167
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:32,779
- God, I wish I�d been there. 
- Well, you�ll be there tonight.

168
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:35,994
Tonight? Tonight I have a date.

169
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,880
Tonight I have a date with Jamie � a Princeton man.

170
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:41,508
I can overlook that.

171
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:47,249
Oh my God, I can�t believe it... I have a date.

172
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:54,228
One day it occurred to me, cows never wrinkle.

173
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:58,693
Think about it � have you ever seen a wrinkled cow? No, not once.

174
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:03,086
- So I thought to myself, "That is weird." 
- Yes, that and other things.

175
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:06,676
So I decided to do a little research. I studied cows, I studied humans,

176
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:10,280
and finally I discovered the secret � the secret of the cows.

177
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,091
- Michel, could you... Hi Kirk. 
- Oh, good, just in time.

178
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:17,326
Kirk here is about to tell us the difference between cows and humans.

179
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:21,320
- You mean, other than one�s a cow? 
- Go ahead, Kirk.

180
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:23,614
- Hay. 
- Huh?

181
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:28,897
Hay, it�s hay � cows eat hay. And after some experimentation and a great deal of research,

182
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,851
I developed what I believe to be the next great skin care product to sweep the nation.

183
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:33,637
Hay There. 

183
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,637
A complete line of creams, balms, toning lotions, and cleansing liquids.

184
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:40,747
Kirk, we already have a skin care line here, I�m sorry.

185
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:46,859
I am willing to give you three cases of "Hay There" skin products absolutely free of charge.

186
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:51,331
- Try them, you will see what I�m talking about. 
- Well, thank you very much, Kirk...

187
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,013
but, I�m sorry � don�t cows eat grass?

188
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:57,546
Sometimes, but "Grass There" is a bad name.

189
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:03,772
So sad not to have a cocktail in your hand every time he comes by, no?

190
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,672
- Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking. 
- What day is this?

191
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:10,721
- Mom? 
- What day is this?

192
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:12,666
- Mom, I have a group of... 
- It�s Thursday.

193
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:15,544
- Thank God. Now, could I possibly... 
- Thursday the what, Lorelai?

194
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:17,264
- It�s... 
- Thursday the third.

195
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:19,558
And what was happening Thursday the third, Lorelai?

196
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:22,492
I believe it was the day I was supposed to chew my own head off.

197
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,232
Your father and I were coming home from Martha�s Vineyard.

198
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:26,369
I know you were. 

198
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:28,769
And you said that when we got home, you were going to call us.

199
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:29,857
I know I did. 

199
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:34,357
We�re home, and yet there�s no call, no message, no card.

200
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:38,325
Mom, it�s eleven o�clock in the morning. I said I would call you on Thursday,

201
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:41,305
I didn�t say when on Thursday, I just said Thursday.

202
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:44,833
Technically I haven�t screwed up for another twelve hours.

203
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:49,687
Lorelai, everyone knows that you are supposed to call people as soon as they have arrived home.

204
00:13:49,757 --> 00:13:53,077
- That�s the polite way to do it. 
- You didn�t tell me what time you were coming home.

205
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:55,309
Well, you never asked what time we were coming home.

206
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:58,549
Yes, but you never told me so there�s no way I could know, so even though I didn�t ask

207
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:02,349
I still didn�t know and it�s only elev... I�m sorry.

208
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:06,563
Apology accepted. Now I assume we�ll be seeing you and Rory for dinner tomorrow?

209
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:09,359
You�ll see me but Rory doesn�t get back �til Saturday.

210
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:12,144
Oh, what a shame. I thought she was coming back tomorrow.

211
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:15,103
- Nope, she�s coming back Saturday. 
- Well, I�m very disappointed.

212
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:18,319
- I had it written down for tomorrow. 
- Well, you must�ve written it down wrong, Mom.

213
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,181
- She�s coming home Saturday. 
- Your father thought it was tomorrow, also.

214
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:22,174
See you at seven. 

214
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:24,474
Hold a moment, Lorelai. Do you know where Christopher is?

215
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:28,826
- Why? 
- We wanted him to come with you and Rory tomorrow,

216
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:32,748
even though apparently Rory�s getting back Saturday, though I couldn�t sworn it was tomorrow.

217
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,302
Christopher�s away on business but I�ll tell him you invited him.

218
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:39,061
And tell him to come with you two next week. I wanna see the three of you together.

219
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:42,943
- Yes, that would be a nice picture. 
- All right, see you tomorrow.

220
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,282
Yes, you will. Bye.

221
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:52,557
- My plane gets in at three. 
- I�m in at six.

222
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:55,844
Red, purple, green � where the hell is it?

223
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:59,697
That gives me three hours to look presentable. Perhaps I�ll go blonde.

224
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:02,538
- I strongly request that you don�t. 
- Afraid of change?

225
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,789
- No, I just like what I have. 
- I like a man who settles.

226
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:07,541
- I miss you. 
- I miss you, too.

227
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:12,302
- Hey, hey, stop being cute. I need help here. 
- I have to go. Paris is melting down.

228
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:14,003
- Why? 
- She has a date tonight.

229
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,006
- Really? 
- Don�t sound so surprised.

230
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:18,970
- How do you know he sounded surprised? 
- Because I�m a genius, Rory.

231
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,924
- I have deep and powerful clairvoyant abilities. 
- Oh boy.

232
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:25,606
For example, I can instantly deduce that when someone hears the name Paris

233
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:29,886
in the same sentence with the word date, jaws will drop, confused looks will cover faces,

234
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,736
words like �how� and �why� and �Quick, Bob, get the children in the minivan

235
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:37,459
because the world is obviously coming to an end!� will immediately fly out of people�s mouths.

236
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,461
- I have to go. 
- Are you sure it�s safe?

237
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:43,040
- I�ll be fine. I�ll see you Friday. 
- See you Friday. I love you.

238
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,854
- That�s it, I�m shaving my head. 
- Gotta go

239
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:51,237
- Okay, Paris, you have got to calm down. 
- I had a black sweater and now it�s gone.

240
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,049
I�m not just talking about right now � in general, you need to calm down.

241
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:56,899
He�s almost here, I�m not dressed, my makeup�s not done,

242
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,112
and I haven�t gone through the Zagat yet to pick out a restaurant.

243
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:01,923
- Why don�t you just let him pick out the restaurant? 
- What if he doesn�t have a Zagat?

244
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:02,869
Well, then he�ll wing it. 

244
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:05,969
Wing it? How come other girls get planned out dinners?

245
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,344
Flowers, candy, rose petals thrown on the floors � and I get wing it?

246
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,503
- Well, you don�t know that you�ve got wing it. 
- No, I do. I�ve got wing it. I can�t do this.

247
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:16,117
- What? 
- Date. I can�t date. I�m not genetically set up for it.

248
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:17,000
Not true. 

248
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,410
I get no pleasure out of the prospect or the preparation.

249
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:22,456
I�m covered in hives, I�ve showered four times, and for what?

250
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:26,342
Some guy who doesn�t even have the brains to buy a Zagat so we don�t wind up in a restaurant

251
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:29,183
- that�s really just a front for a cocaine laundering ring? 
- Sit.

252
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:33,833
It�s a dare. He was dared to take me out.

253
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:38,872
- I bet Trent Lott was behind this. 
- Trent Lott did not dare Jamie to take you out.

254
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:43,654
Close. Jamie likes you and he asked you out because he likes you. Now look up.

255
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,894
Maybe I shouldn�t go. I mean, what if I fall for him and he doesn�t like me?

256
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:49,256
- Then you�ll find someone else. 
- But what if there is no one else?

257
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:52,615
- Then you�ll buy some cats. 
- I wish I knew if he was right for me, you know?

258
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:56,163
So I don�t put myself through all of this for nothing. I mean, women fall for men who are wrong

259
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:59,424
for them all of the time, and then they get sidetracked from their goals.

260
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:03,316
They give up careers and become alcoholics and, if you�re Sunny von B�low, wind up in a coma

261
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:06,593
completely incapable of stopping Glenn Close from playing you in a movie.

262
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:08,364
I think you should wear your hair down.

263
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,555
How do you know if a guy is right for you?

264
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,169
- You just have to feel it. 
- All I feel is my back breaking out.

265
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,159
You�ll know, okay? You just have to let it happen.

266
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,866
And then, probably when you�re not looking, you�ll find someone who compliments you.

267
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,763
- Meaning? 
- Someone who likes what you like,

268
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:29,603
someone who reads the same books or listens to the same music

269
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:32,358
or likes to trash the same movies. Someone compatible. 

270
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:38,814
- But not so compatible that they�re boring. 
- Someone who�s compatible but not compatible.

271
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:42,880
Yeah, kind of. I mean, you respect each other�s opinions

272
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:47,674
and you can laugh at the same jokes, but I don�t know � there�s just something about not quite knowing

273
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,719
what the other person�s gonna do at all times that�s just really exciting.

274
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:56,589
Look, just have a good time, you�ll figure it out.

275
00:17:57,433 --> 00:18:01,022
Yeah, well, I hope I figure it out fast... before I throw up.

276
00:18:02,973 --> 00:18:04,585
- That�s him. 
- Turn around.

277
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:06,741
- Well? 
- Perfect.

278
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:08,466
- Promise? 
- Swear.

279
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:11,089
- Thanks. Now get in the closet. 
- What?

280
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:13,674
If he comes in here and sees you, he won�t wanna date me anymore.

281
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,511
Paris, that�s crazy! He�s seen me � he�s seen me for weeks.

282
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,387
Yes, in conferences, crowded lecture halls, badly lit banquet rooms 

282
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:22,187
with crappy food smells, not at night when it�s dating time

283
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:25,129
and he�s thinking about dating and you�re standing there looking all datable.

284
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:27,833
- I�m not looking datable. 
- Please? I can�t risk it.

285
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,078
At least if there�s nothing to compare me to, then I�ve got a fighting chance, please!

286
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:36,337
Okay, but when you get home, you need to get a new therapist

287
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:38,677
because the one you have is really not working.

288
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,845
- Thanks for helping me get ready. 
- Any time.

289
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:51,759
- Hi. 
- Hello.

290
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,825
- You look very nice. 
- Well, this is a really good sweater.

291
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:59,687
- So, shall we get going? 
- Oh, sure, sure.

292
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,042
- Do you like Italian food? 
- I love Italian food.

293
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:04,237
Good. I�ve made a reservation at a great place.

294
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:06,332
Well, at least, that�s what the Zagat guide says.

295
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:09,332
- You�re perfect. 
- Let�s go.

296
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:26,194
- How could you not tell them? 
- Well, they left two days after your wedding

297
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,506
and they were in Martha�s Vineyard all summer. It just seemed quieter.

298
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,805
- What do you think, manly? 
- In an Oscar Wilde sort of way, absolutely.

299
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,130
You know, you�re gonna have to tell them tonight, right? I mean, the subject will come up.

300
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:40,536
They probably think you and Christopher are heading down the aisle any day now.

301
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:41,994
I know, I know.

302
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:46,726
- A shaving table, it�s perfect! 
- And twelve hundred dollars.

303
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:51,119
- Twelve hundred dollars for what? 
- What do you mean, for what? This is an antique.

304
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:52,513
Where does she come from?

305
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:54,985
- This was Sherman�s shaving table. 
- Sherman?

306
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,826
General Sherman, famous man, burned Atlanta, liked a close shave.

307
00:19:57,924 --> 00:20:00,520
- Wow, historical. 
- All original, perfect shape.

308
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:03,710
- I give you ten percent off, you want it? 
- Oh, well, maybe.

309
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:08,059
I just wanted to look around a little bit first... but it�s very nice.

310
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:11,554
- I know it�s very nice. 
- Boy, she would�ve made a great nun.

311
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:15,477
- So how are you planning on telling them? 
-  I thought I�d do it like Nell.

312
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:19,573
- You know, chicka chicka chickabee. 
- Yeah, that�s a very good idea.

313
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,785
- I�ll tell them, I promise. 
- Oh, oh my God, look!

314
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:28,017
- What? 
- For over the mantelpiece. It�s perfect!

315
00:20:28,113 --> 00:20:29,362
It�s a dead fish. 

315
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:32,762
It�s an antique stuffed and mounted trout, and I think it�s manly.

316
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:35,502
- Oh, please! 
- It is! It�s very Ralph Lauren.

317
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:38,048
Sookie, Jackson loves you. You�re not seriously telling me

318
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,104
the future of your marriage depends on Leon Troutsky over there. 

318
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,134
I guess not.

319
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:44,339
Just think about it, okay? You don�t have to make every decision right now.

320
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,771
Do a little more shopping. Maybe you�ll find something even more disgusting someplace else.

321
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:50,489
- Okay. 
- Okay, I gotta go pick up Rory at the airport,

322
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,068
and then we�ll swing by and pick up you guys for the festival. 

322
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,168
- Great.
- Okay, see you later. 

324
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,499
- Ten bucks if you don�t let her buy the fish. 
- Twenty.

325
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:02,542
- You�re kidding? 
- I never kid.

326
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,008
You know, I believe that.

327
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:10,095
Hey Gilmore!

328
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,030
Mom!

329
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:21,017
Luckily there are video cameras everywhere that caught that very graceful moment on tape.

330
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:23,464
- I am so glad to see you! 
- No, I�m glad to see you!

331
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:26,449
- I�m never leaving home again. 
- Oh, that�s my emotionally stunted girl!

332
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:27,670
Hey, I got you gifts. 

332
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:30,270
What? I�m the one that left town, I�m supposed to get you gifts.

333
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:33,709
Oh, but I got here early and there was nothing to do except feed gummy bears

334
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:37,689
to the bomb-sniffing dogs which, apparently, the United States government frowns upon.

335
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,860
You got in trouble with the government while you were waiting for me?

336
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:41,278
- Just a little. 
- How much is a little?

337
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,864
Learn Russian. Okay, here you go.

338
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:47,382
- Wow, a Hartford, Connecticut sweatshirt. 
- Nice, huh?

339
00:21:47,484 --> 00:21:52,199
Hartford, Connecticut notebook, Hartford, Connecticut pencil set, a Hartford, Connecticut shot glass.

340
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,004
And beer mug! 

340
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:57,284
Hartford baguette, Hartford bear, a Hartford sunglasses.

341
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:58,692
- You like? 
- I love.

342
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,824
All right, let�s go. We�ll get your bags, then we�ll hit the road, and I can�t wait to hear all about Washington.

343
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:05,292
And, by the way, I got you out of dinner with the Gilmores tonight.

344
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,277
I thought you and Dean might enjoy a little Peaches and Herb time together.

345
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,987
Oh, thanks. What�d you tell �em?

346
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:12,998
- That you get home tomorrow. 
- Big fat lie.

347
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,471
Yes, which proves how much I love you.

348
00:22:15,574 --> 00:22:17,562
The fact that I was willing to lie to my own parents 

348
00:22:17,674 --> 00:22:20,762
who I never lie to just so you could have a night of happiness

349
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:25,004
is proof positive of my deep undying devotion that I have for you.

350
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:26,521
I appreciate that. 

350
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:30,321
And all that devotion can be yours for the low, low price of $29.95!

351
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:32,348
- Forget it. 
- Okay, I�ll throw in a set of steak knives.

352
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:33,465
My bags, please? 

352
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:36,065
Are you telling me that you want this gesture of love for free?

353
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,453
What kind of world are you living in?

354
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,445
Oh my God, you do know one option was leaving some of your books at home?

355
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:47,535
- Hey, I offered to carry that one. 
- Next time, don�t offer � insist. Look, I�m lopsided now.

356
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:50,800
I can�t believe I�m home. I feel like I�ve been away forever. 

356
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:51,800
I agree.

357
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:55,549
- Hello living room. 
- Hello Rory, we missed you.

358
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,797
Not the ottoman, of course, but everyone knows he�s a snob.

359
00:22:57,888 --> 00:23:00,000
Napoleon complex, he only really likes the magazine rack. 

359
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:02,420
Oh my God, I missed everything.

360
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:07,258
My kitchen, my room, my books, my CDs, my stuff.

361
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:10,961
- Where�s my pillow? 
- What?

362
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,977
- You took my pillow. 
- I did not take your pillow.

363
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:16,793
You waited until I left, you went into my room, and you took my pillow.

364
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:18,917
- Well, you weren�t using it. 
- What else did you take?

365
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:22,978
Nothing. Your comforter came into my room by itself...

366
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:26,604
- and brought your Bauhaus T-shirt with it. 
- I want my stuff back by tomorrow morning.

367
00:23:26,692 --> 00:23:28,724
Just �cause you leave doesn�t mean the world stops.

368
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:29,948
- By noon. 
- Fine.

369
00:23:30,152 --> 00:23:32,789
- Lor, it�s me, please just call... 
- Dad?

370
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:36,875
- Yeah. 
- Still haven�t talked to him yet, huh?

371
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:38,712
- No, you? 
- Nope.

372
00:23:38,908 --> 00:23:41,083
- He�s called. 
- I know. He�s called me, too.

373
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,098
- I just... I don�t really know what to say. 
- How long are you gonna freeze him out for?

374
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:46,010
I don�t know.

375
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:47,643
- Right. 
- You?

376
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:50,546
- I don�t know either. 
- I have to tell my parents tonight.

377
00:23:50,644 --> 00:23:53,956
Are you sure you don�t want me to go with you and... I don�t know, distract �em?

378
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,714
No, you�ve got Dean coming over. I�ll be fine. I�ll bring them something shiny.

379
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,518
- Okay, I�m gonna go change then. 
- For what?

380
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:00,544
The festival. 

380
00:24:00,645 --> 00:24:03,744
Hon, you know what, if you don�t wanna go, we don�t have to go.

381
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,386
Why would I not wanna go? Of course I wanna go.

382
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:08,527
You just got home, you�ve got Dean coming over.

383
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:12,534
No, I wanna go. I wanna go because this is our town and we need to support these things.

384
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:14,911
All right, but... you don�t have to change for that.

385
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:18,142
Well, I�ve been away for awhile, I wanna make a nice impression.

386
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:20,501
- On who? 
- Whoever has to look at me.

387
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,826
All right, just hustle. I promised Jackson and Sookie I�d pick them up along the way.

388
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,682
- I�ll just be a minute. 
- No woman is ever a minute when she changes.

389
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:30,347
- Do not judge me by your own standards. 
- Wow, fancy.

390
00:24:30,496 --> 00:24:31,576
Not fancy. 

390
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:34,376
You know, you�ll have time to come home and change for Dean.

391
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,467
Well, I can just change now, then I won�t have to do it later.

392
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:38,776
Okay. Hey Rory,

393
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:43,051
- I don�t want you to freeze out your dad because I am. 
- I�m not.

394
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:45,621
�Cause I�m fine if you wanna go back to the way things were.

395
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:50,451
- I think that would be a little hard this time. 
- Okay, maybe not now, but eventually.

396
00:24:50,517 --> 00:24:53,774
Eventually, maybe, but for now � solidarity sister.

397
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:56,378
You�ve been waiting for six weeks to do that, haven�t you?

398
00:24:56,672 --> 00:24:58,018
I�ll just be a minute.

399
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:15,001
See, three minutes faster. I also found a way to get to Al�s Pancake World

400
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:17,106
that shaves a good forty seconds off our normal route.

401
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,638
- You were really bored when I was gone, weren�t you? 
- You have no idea.

402
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:24,705
Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?

403
00:25:24,828 --> 00:25:29,099
- I don�t understand why you�re so upset. 
- How can you not understand?

404
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:32,657
- I told you a thousand times. 
- I thought you were just being nice.

405
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,129
Nice! Sookie, look at this place!

406
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:38,165
- I think it looks nice. 
- Nice... nice?

407
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,339
- This is nice... this is nice? 
- Well, it�s masculine!

408
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:47,008
No, it�s terrifying! I swear I�m gonna come out in the middle of the night for a drink of water,

409
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,998
- turn around, hit the floor and play dead! 
- Okay, so, we have a little work to do.

410
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:54,520
- Just put it back the way it was. 
- No, I want you to be happy!

411
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:59,190
I was happy, I told you I was happy, you just didn�t wanna believe I was happy!

412
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:02,617
- We�ll just check on them a little later. 
- Excellent idea.

413
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:22,002
Okay, so, do we do cheese stick, hot dog, cotton candy,

414
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:24,400
or do we mix it up a little � start with the cotton candy 

414
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:26,400
and end with the cheese stick? Who are you looking for?

415
00:26:26,655 --> 00:26:29,407
No one, I�m just taking in all the madness, that�s all.

416
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:33,471
- Lorelai, good. Have you used the cream yet? 
- Not yet, Kirk.

417
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:35,457
- Good, there�s been a little problem. 
- What kind of problem?

418
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,340
Nothing of major concern. It just seems that with continual use,

419
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:42,396
the cream develops some weird reactions to light... and air... and movement.

420
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:43,983
Are you serious? 

420
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:45,683
Don�t worry, it�s just a small kink. It�ll all be worked out soon.

421
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:48,581
- I have three cases of that stuff sitting at the inn. 
- Well, get rid of it.

422
00:26:48,653 --> 00:26:50,691
- Kirk. 
- But don�t throw it in the trash.

423
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,620
- Apparently, that would be an EPA violation. 
- What am I supposed to do with the stuff?

424
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,804
- Shooting it into space is about all I�ve got now. 
- Kirk!

425
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:59,073
- I�ll pick up the cases tomorrow. 
- Thank you.

426
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,706
- Hey. 
- What?

427
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:06,108
Do you sometimes think this town is weird or is it just me?

428
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:20,680
- Hey Taylor, is this where the mosh pit starts? 
- Hello Lorelai, Rory.

429
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:23,026
So what do you think of the band? Pretty big city, don�t you think? 

429
00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:24,526
I sure do.

430
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:27,921
- What? 
- What? I�m agreeing with you. They are smokin�!

431
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:32,263
- I do not care for that sarcastic tone, Lorelai. 
- Well... no, I�m being nice here!

432
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,481
You have an opinion on everything. Nothing is ever up to your standards.

433
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:40,358
That is not true. I�m sure these guys are all great barbers.

434
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:42,084
I don�t even know why I bother.

435
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,148
That is it � I have been it for the last...

436
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,265
What?

437
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:54,844
Oh, well, looks like he�s got his �what I did this summer� essay all researched and ready to go.

438
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:57,337
- Guess you dodged a bullet there, huh? 
- What do you mean?

439
00:27:57,465 --> 00:28:03,007
I don�t know. It seems kind of lucky that you didn�t throw everything away for Jess when you see...

440
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:04,291
See what? What am I seeing?

441
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:06,586
- You�re upset. 
- No, I�m not upset.

442
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,955
Yes, you are upset. I know when you�re upset �cause you look like my mother.

443
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:10,610
- Thanks a lot. 
- You like my mother.

444
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:13,405
Yes, but you don�t like your mother, so when you tell me that I look like your mother,

445
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:15,582
- it�s not exactly a compliment. 
- Honey, what is wrong?

446
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:17,993
- Oh God! 
- What is it?

447
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:19,006
It�s that!

448
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:20,655
- Jess? 
- Yes!

449
00:28:20,753 --> 00:28:22,401
- You�re upset about Jess? 
- I said yes.

450
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:24,526
- Yes, it�s Jess? 
- You�re not being funny.

451
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:28,545
It�s not my fault that yes and Jess rhyme. Did I exploit the opportunity, of course I did, but...

452
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:32,868
- Rory, come on. I know you had this crush... 
- It wasn�t a crush.

453
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:35,203
Well, I thought it was over. I mean, you haven�t talked to him since... 

453
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:36,403
Sookie�s wedding.

454
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,873
- You talked to him at Sookie�s wedding? 
- Yes.

455
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,292
- He wasn�t at Sookie�s wedding. 
- Yes, he was.

456
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:44,081
- He had just come back and he came to see me. 
- Okay, so he crashed Sookie�s wedding, and...

457
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:48,080
And nothing. He told me that he was back in town, that he�d moved back, and...

458
00:28:48,864 --> 00:28:52,170
- What Rory? Come on. 
- And we kissed, okay?

459
00:28:52,345 --> 00:28:54,029
- You kissed? 
- Yes.

460
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:56,457
- You kissed, like... you kissed? 
- Yes.

461
00:28:56,594 --> 00:28:59,599
- Okay, who kissed who? 
- What does that matter?

462
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:03,767
Because it matters. Did he kiss you, did you kiss each other, did you trip and your faces accidentally...

463
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,079
- I kissed him. 
- Okay.

464
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,490
And I don�t know, I thought he came back here because he liked me or something,

465
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:14,045
and I kissed him and he kissed me back, and now he�s over there and I feel so stupid and...

466
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:17,259
- that girl isn�t even his type and... 
- Rory, what are you doing?

467
00:29:17,374 --> 00:29:19,247
What do you mean, what am I doing? I�m ranting.

468
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:21,192
You should recognize this, I learned it from you.

469
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,543
Yeah, but you went to Sookie�s wedding with... with Dean.

470
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:26,364
- I know. 
- And then you ran off to have some thing with Jess.

471
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:28,555
- It was a kiss, not a thing. 
- A kiss is a thing.

472
00:29:28,653 --> 00:29:30,455
Well, it wasn�t planned, it just happened.

473
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:32,554
I can�t believe it. All this time I�m thinking, �She�s with Dean.�

474
00:29:32,657 --> 00:29:33,685
I am with Dean. 

474
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:36,005
No, Rory � kissing another guy is not being with Dean.

475
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,163
- Ask him, I bet he�d back me up on that. 
- It was nothing.

476
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:41,307
- Well, then why are you so freaked out? 
- I�m not freaked out.

477
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:44,147
Look, kid, you have gotta make up your mind. Jess, Dean, Jess, Dean,

478
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:48,003
it�s enough already. If you want Jess, that�s fine � go get him, there he is.

479
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,518
If you think that�s the great love of your life, then great... 

479
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,018
grab a liver treat and a squeaky toy and run to him.

480
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:59,155
Don�t worry about that girl because I�m sure he will have moved onto somebody else in about an hour.

481
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:03,767
But do something. Dean has been sweet and supportive and incredibly patient,

482
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,608
and now you are officially treating him like dirt, 

482
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,708
and I�m sorry, but not only is that not you, he doesn�t deserve that.

483
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,483
- God, I wish they knew another song! 
- I know all of this about Dean.

484
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:13,826
- You do? 
- Yes, I do. 

484
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:16,226
I know how great he is. I knew it before you did!

485
00:30:16,286 --> 00:30:19,795
Well, knowing this has apparently not stopped you from dragging his heart all over this town.

486
00:30:19,882 --> 00:30:22,672
- Not fair! 
- Yes, fair, the fairest, the Snow White of fair.

487
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:24,031
I don�t wanna talk to you about this anymore. 

487
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:26,231
Okay, listen, if you don�t wanna be with Dean anymore,

488
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:31,930
cut him loose. Let him find someone who does because this is just so... wrong!

489
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:34,997
- All right, I get it, I... just stop! 
- Rory!

490
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:40,404
- Hi Dean. 
- I thought your plane didn�t get in �til six.

491
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:44,479
- Well, I managed to get an earlier flight. 
- Well, I�m off to dinner with the parents.

492
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:46,498
- Do you have... 
- No, she�s off the hook.

493
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:50,467
You guys have all night to... talk. Enjoy. Good to have you back, Dean.

494
00:30:50,537 --> 00:30:51,705
- Thanks. 
- See you later.

495
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:57,701
- So, did I interrupt something? 
- No, nothing. We were just...

496
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:02,273
- Hi, you�re back. 
- Yeah, I�m back, and I�m glad to find you not blonde.

497
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:04,664
Yeah, I was just having way too much fun, so...

498
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:07,362
- I missed you. 
- I missed you, too.

499
00:31:26,287 --> 00:31:29,267
- Lorelai, nice to see you. 
- Oh, sorry I�m late, Mom.

500
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,300
No, don�t be sorry.

501
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:35,674
That�s what the warm setting was invented for. Richard, Lorelai�s here!

502
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:40,102
Mom, before we get the evening started and all, I wanna tell you something.

503
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:42,340
- Well, tell me outside. 
- No, I�ll just do it here.

504
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:43,542
Why? 

504
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:45,742
Oh, there�s just something about standing near the exit

505
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:47,918
- that�s really working for me. 
- You�re being silly,

506
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:50,398
you don�t discuss things standing by a door. Come outside, come on.

507
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:54,838
I may have to take one more call tonight, Emily. Ben Stellen and I got cut off. Hello Lorelai.

508
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:58,990
Well, come outside with us until he calls back. Lorelai�s about to tell us something.

509
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:02,043
Oh, perhaps that she�s decided to buy an accurate timepiece.

510
00:32:02,242 --> 00:32:03,614
Oh, Richard.

511
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:07,055
- Is Rory okay? 
- Oh, yes, Rory�s fine,

512
00:32:07,147 --> 00:32:09,204
I�m fine, everything�s fine, it�s really not that big a deal. 

512
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:10,204
What would you like to drink?

513
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:12,877
- Oh, whatever. 
- I can�t read minds, Lorelai.

514
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:15,929
- I really don�t care, Dad. Whatever you have. 
- We have everything, Lorelai.

515
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:19,180
- Al right, I�ll have a Yaegermeister and a Jell-O shot. 
- Excuse me?

516
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:21,510
- White wine. 
- All right, sit, sit.

517
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,318
Now go ahead, tell us.

518
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,517
- Okay, well... 
- Oh, wait just a second.

519
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:34,189
- We brought you something from Martha�s Vineyard. 
- Oh, that�s great, but maybe we could just do...

520
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,573
- Okay, I guess it�s present time. 
- Open it.

521
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:43,046
Scone mix, wow.

522
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:47,848
This new little place opened right down the road from our house and they make these wonderful scones,

523
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:50,818
and that is their mix so you can make them right in your own kitchen.

524
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:52,201
Well, thanks, Mom.

525
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:56,103
I will put this right on the counter and stare at it for many years to come.

526
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:58,622
- You�re not going to make them? 
- Oh, I�m not really much of a baker.

527
00:32:58,682 --> 00:33:01,490
- But the instructions are right there on the back. 
- Yeah, I know, but still.

528
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:03,865
Still what? Those are good scones.

529
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,508
Hey, maybe I�ll give this to Sookie and she�ll bake them.

530
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:10,081
I don�t understand why you simply can�t follow those directions and make the scones.

531
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:11,852
Rory would love those scones.

532
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:14,940
Okay, I promise one way or another, the scones will get eaten.

533
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,445
- That being said, can we please move on? 
- Fine, go ahead, talk, we�re listening.

534
00:33:22,728 --> 00:33:26,359
Okay, well, it�s about Christopher.

535
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:29,491
Oh, that reminds me, we got him a captain�s hat.

536
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,637
- Richard, where is that hat? Lorelai can bring it to him. 
- No, I can�t!

537
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:33,644
Why not?

538
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,883
Well, it�s just...

539
00:33:37,004 --> 00:33:39,108
- Chris and I aren�t... 
- Aren�t what?

540
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,831
- They aren�t together anymore, Richard. 
- Why not?

541
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:47,341
- I�m sure a vague reason is forthcoming. 
- It just didn�t work out, that�s all.

542
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:49,467
- And there it is. 
- I know you�re disappointed.

543
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:52,585
Disappointed, oh please! Lorelai, this is ridiculous.

544
00:33:52,662 --> 00:33:54,838
- The two of you aren�t in high school anymore. 
- I know.

545
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:58,217
- Emily, let�s not talk about this. 
- No, we are going to talk about it.

546
00:33:58,376 --> 00:34:03,179
You�re running around like you have no responsibility in life, like you can flit from thing to thing...

547
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,931
- That�s not true. 
- ... from man to man.

548
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:09,148
- I don�t flit from man to man. 
- You have a daughter, this affects Rory too, you know!

549
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,652
- Emily, you�re wasting your breath. 
- I know this affects Rory.

550
00:34:11,734 --> 00:34:15,018
I�m not doing this lightly. In fact, I�m not doing anything at all.

551
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:17,478
- There�s no reason to raise your voice. 
- I can�t believe this.

552
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:19,666
I wanna know why. I want a reason.

553
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:23,327
I don�t want any of this �just because� and �it just didn�t work out� nonsense.

554
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,208
I want a solid, adult reason why the father of my granddaughter

555
00:34:27,302 --> 00:34:31,511
- and her mother can�t seem to put a family together. 
- His girlfriend is pregnant.

556
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:34,894
- What? 
- Sherry is pregnant,

557
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:38,907
and when Christopher found out, he went back to her and that, Mother, is the reason.

558
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,054
- Are they getting married? 
- I don�t know... probably.

559
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,686
- Oh, of course they�re getting married. 
- How do you know?

560
00:34:43,758 --> 00:34:47,577
I know because I know Christopher, and Christopher always tries to do the right thing.

561
00:34:47,674 --> 00:34:52,047
The right thing is for him to be with his family. Lorelai and Rory are his family.

562
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:55,410
- He met this woman two minutes ago. 
- Emily, he is going to be a father.

563
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:59,287
- He already is a father! 
- I really really don�t wanna discuss this anymore.

564
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,175
- Lorelai, you have to talk to him. 
- There�s nothing to talk about.

565
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,914
- Tell him you wanna get married. 
- Okay, Mom, please stop.

566
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:09,073
Yes, Emily, please stop. You know that Lorelai never does anything unless she wants to...

567
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:12,354
- no matter the consequences to anyone else. 
- What�s that supposed to mean?

568
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:15,600
Lorelai wants to be with Christopher, she told us that at the wedding.

569
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:18,191
- Yes, and now the wind has changed. 
- Excuse me?

570
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:23,102
Christopher is living up to his responsibilities as he tried to do many years ago with Lorelai,

571
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:26,199
- then she turned him down and turned him away. 
- I was sixteen.

572
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:32,389
If Christopher has found someone who will actually allow him to be a father to his own child,

573
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,551
then of course, that�s what he�s going to do.

574
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:37,290
- So you support this? 
- I understand this.

575
00:35:37,388 --> 00:35:40,858
- I am appalled by your attitude. 
- And I am shocked by your na�vet�.

576
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:43,075
Did you really expect this to work out?

577
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:48,596
Did you really have pictures of Norman Rockwell family Christmases dancing in your head?

578
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:52,800
Lorelai had her chance for a family, she walked away from it. That was her choice.

579
00:35:52,928 --> 00:35:57,137
- He has a chance to be a father. I applaud him. 
- Then you�re an idiot.

580
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:59,399
If you�ll excuse me, I�m going into my study.

581
00:35:59,764 --> 00:36:04,223
Richard! You do not walk out on me when we are having a discussion.

582
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,107
Richard!

583
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:50,552
We�re closed.

584
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:52,426
I know.

585
00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:58,298
Look, I didn�t come here to make up, or to try to get you to forgive me, or talk.

586
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:02,104
I wouldn�t even have come here at all

587
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,497
but I had a really crappy night and I really, really need a cup of coffee.

588
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,516
Just pretend I�m not me.

589
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:15,964
I�m Mimi, a new customer. I�ve never been in here before.

590
00:37:16,783 --> 00:37:21,661
I was just walking down the street and I spotted this place. �Ooh, hey, nice place.�

591
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:27,423
And I came in. Now Mimi is going to pour herself a cup of coffee

592
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:32,969
and sit over here way far away from you, and she promises,

593
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:37,561
just as soon as she�s done, she will rinse out her own cup and leave.

594
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:52,753
This is the second time I let myself do this.

595
00:37:55,016 --> 00:37:58,456
- Do what? 
- Think I finally found it.

596
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:01,484
- Found what? 
- Love, comfort, safety.

597
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:07,095
I mean, first with Max, which of course, I screwed up,

598
00:38:07,176 --> 00:38:12,626
and then with Christopher, which of course, all the elements of the universe got together to screw up.

599
00:38:12,737 --> 00:38:17,847
Yup, it�s tough when the universe is against you. That�s like taking on the Manhattan garbage union.

600
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:22,660
I always thought if he could just get it together, grow up...

601
00:38:23,623 --> 00:38:24,964
maybe we could do it.

602
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:32,379
Maybe we could really be a family, in the stupid, traditional �Dan Quayle, golden retriever,

603
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:35,436
grow old together, wear matching jogging suits� kind of way.

604
00:38:37,444 --> 00:38:41,536
And then he did get it together � he became that guy...

605
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:49,015
and he gets to be that guy with her.

606
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:55,314
Chris is gonna have a baby with his girlfriend.

607
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,534
He�s gonna marry her...

608
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:04,003
and he�s gonna be there for her while she�s pregnant 

608
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:07,593
and he�s gonna be there with her while her child grows up,

609
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:10,229
and he�s gonna be there for her while she does...

610
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:13,332
whatever it is she does.

611
00:39:15,457 --> 00:39:19,824
And I am in exactly the same place

612
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,687
that I was in before.

613
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:25,298
Is that so bad? I mean, you got Rory.

614
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:27,680
Yes, I do.

615
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:32,063
You got friends, you got a house, a job, apparently an iron stomach.

616
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:35,544
No, it�s not so bad. I�m lucky, I know.

617
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:41,556
I just... I feel like I�m never gonna have it...

618
00:39:42,635 --> 00:39:44,960
the whole package, you know?

619
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:49,491
That person, that couple life,

620
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:56,379
and I swear, I hate admitting it because I fancy myself Wonder Woman, but...

621
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,121
I really want it...

622
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:03,348
the whole package.

623
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,622
- You�ll get it. 
- How do you know?

624
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:19,630
- I know. 
- How do you know?

625
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,364
Because I know, okay? I know. Now eat your donut.

626
00:40:22,472 --> 00:40:25,821
- I�m really not very hungry. 
- Well, take it with you. You will be later.

627
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:34,981
Forget it, first time customers are on the house.

628
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:36,834
- Mimi, was it? 
- Yeah.

629
00:40:37,986 --> 00:40:39,163
Come again, Mimi.

630
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,528
Thanks, I will.

631
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:46,619
Seems like a very nice place.

632
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:03,076
- Hey, you�re home. 
- Yup, I�m home.

633
00:41:03,183 --> 00:41:07,428
Oh, hey, I figured how to get the Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer out of our heads...

634
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:11,426
to sing the Small World song over and over for the next forty-eight hours.

635
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:15,324
Of course, how we get the Small World song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.

636
00:41:16,328 --> 00:41:20,879
Okay, see, that was not how that whole scene between us was supposed to go.

637
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:24,894
- No? 
- No. I mean, yes,

638
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,904
I was surprised and I do think the basic sentiment of �make up your mind� was kind of called for.

639
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,806
- Absolutely called for. 
- But I didn�t mean to upset you

640
00:41:34,894 --> 00:41:37,202
and yell at you and make you feel bad, I�m really sorry, hon. 

640
00:41:37,304 --> 00:41:38,562
I know, but you were right.

641
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,330
Ah, well, that�s once, I guess.

642
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,746
- So how was dinner? 
- So how was Dean?

643
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,405
- So how was dinner? 
- So how was Dean?

644
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:48,754
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Williams� sisters take center stage at Wimbledon once again.

645
00:41:48,846 --> 00:41:50,284
- Dinner was bad. 
- Sorry.

646
00:41:50,393 --> 00:41:54,299
That�s okay, I knew it would be. Oh, but the good news is we can now go back to Luke�s.

647
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:57,654
- You made up! How did you make up? 
- Well, I�m Mimi now.

648
00:41:57,812 --> 00:42:00,535
- Oh, sure. 
- So speaking of Dean, is there still a Dean?

649
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,624
- Yeah, there�s still a Dean. 
- Really?

650
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:05,779
I don�t know what I was doing. Maybe it�s because I haven�t dated a lot

651
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,721
but this Jess thing was crazy. And I do love Dean and you were absolutely right...

652
00:42:09,783 --> 00:42:14,110
I was treating him like dirt and I wasn�t appreciating what was right in front of me, but I�m going to now.

653
00:42:14,191 --> 00:42:17,004
Rory, I don�t want you to stay with Dean because of me. 

653
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:17,894
I know.

654
00:42:17,976 --> 00:42:19,460
- �Cause I was upset earlier. 
- I know.

655
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:22,672
I still have this Christopher thing bugging me and the pressure of tonight�s dinner.

656
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:24,243
- I know. 
- I didn�t wanna upset you

657
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,997
and I certainly don�t want you to make an important decision off of... 

658
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:28,544
- Because it�s too important... 
- Mom.

659
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:29,522
- And I just want you to be happy. 
- Mom! 

659
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:31,922
All I did was think about what you said, that�s all.

660
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:35,590
- Then I analyzed the situation. 
- And then you made a pro and con list.

661
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:39,338
You�re mocking me, but yes, I did. And after all of this, I came to the conclusion

662
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,861
that I want to make things good with Dean, and he deserves my undivided attention.

663
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:45,522
- And you feel good about this? 
- I feel really good about this.

664
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:50,783
Okay, because if you decided you really did wanna date Jess, I would help you...

665
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:54,110
- get vaccinated. 
- Thank you, but I�m good.

666
00:42:54,218 --> 00:42:56,317
- All right, as long as you�re good. 
- I am good.

667
00:42:56,414 --> 00:42:58,826
- Well, okay, good. 
- What about you, are you good?

668
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:03,628
- Me? Well, I�m gonna be good. 
- Is there anything I can do to help?

669
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,566
- Your existence is a huge help. 
- We�re both gonna be good.

670
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:13,710
Yeah. I wonder if Christopher and Sherry�s baby is going to look like me?

671
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,623
Well, if the kid knows what�s good for it, it absolutely will.

672
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,754
Hand me my purse, will you? I�m hungry.
