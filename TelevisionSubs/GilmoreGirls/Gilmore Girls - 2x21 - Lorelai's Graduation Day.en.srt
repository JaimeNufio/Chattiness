1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,921
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,715
- What do you mean you had an accident?
- Jess swerved and...

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,509
Jess was driving and you had an accident?

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:09,593
But I'm fine.

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,636
What accident?

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,679
Jess was driving Rory's car
and he crashed it.

7
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,140
- Have you talked to Dean?
- No, he gets home tomorrow.

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,475
- What'll you say?
- I don't know.

9
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,269
If you hadn't brought him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,312
This is my fault?

11
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,190
- What did you do to your arm?
- Here.

12
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,650
- What is this?
- Just read it.

13
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,903
Now I have to find Jess,
and I have to make sure that he's okay...

14
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:31,281
and if that cuts into your screaming time,
that's just too damn bad.

15
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,075
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you!

16
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,160
Not long after the accident happened...

17
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,329
Luke walked him
straight to the bus station...

18
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,790
stuck the kid on the bus,
sent him home to his mom.

19
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,167
- Is he really gone?
- Yes.

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,086
Okay.

21
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,714
Do you wanna come in?

22
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,509
All I know is that Jess is gone.

23
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,848
Well, what will we do
for entertainment around here?

24
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,183
Beats the hell out of me.

25
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,691
- Where is this place?
- Not too far.

26
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,526
You've been saying that for miles.

27
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,070
- My feet are sore.
- When did you become older than me?

28
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,865
Tell me what this new breakfast place is,
and I'll be quiet.

29
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,118
It an amazing new mystery place I found.
That's all I'm telling you.

30
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,494
Is it in this town or the next?

31
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,830
- We don't patronize the next town.
- Since when?

32
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,332
Didn't they feed lead
to our jumping frog or something?

33
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,043
Right after they stoned the woman
who won the lottery.

34
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,420
See, so the boycott's legit.

35
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,672
- Wait. Stop.
- Look, it's Michael Landon.

36
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,550
You guys walk fast.
I've been chasing you the past two blocks.

37
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,759
We were being followed.

38
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,303
I told you I wasn't being paranoid.

39
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,347
Now you'll believe me
when I say the furniture moved itself.

40
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,183
- Where're you going?
- Mystery breakfast.

41
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,935
- Out of town?
- Remember the definition of mystery?

42
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,230
I was wondering if it's okay
to practice on your pots and pans again.

43
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,899
It's not like they have any other use.

44
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,192
I've almost nailed Ramble On.

45
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,236
I have to stop hitting my face
with the sticks when I pull back.

46
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,738
John Bonham had that same problem.

47
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,240
- Key is in the turtle.
- Enjoy your mystery breakfast.

48
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,700
Come on. It's not much farther.

49
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,078
We're not heading toward
any businesses of any kind.

50
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,580
What?

51
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,874
- We have arrived.
- Arrived where?

52
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,834
You are without shame.

53
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,921
Sookie, you do not have to do this.

54
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,925
What do you mean? Feeding my girls,
making them happy. I love doing this.

55
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,843
Yeah, so feel the love and pass the salt.

56
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,679
- It makes me feel guilty.
- Eating can help drown that.

57
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,765
Yeah, eat. I'm gonna eat.

58
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,518
Can the help sit at the table, too?

59
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,395
As long as they don't sing folk songs
or tell bawdy stories.

60
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,232
What's with Narcoleptic Nate over there?

61
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,276
He's not much of a morning person.

62
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,738
Now say,
'I can't believe I ate the whole thing. '

63
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,741
It takes him about an hour
to become Jackson.

64
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,285
- Hey, I had a good idea for the wedding.
- Cool.

65
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,497
Instead of wrapped Jordan almonds things
at every place setting...

66
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,041
- what if we wrap up a few Aspirin?
- Aspirin?

67
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,252
For the morning-after hangovers.

68
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,296
- That's funny.
- 'Cause Jordan almonds are so done.

69
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,508
Jackson, what do you think?
Aspirin over almonds?

70
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,553
- Can we take that as a yes?
- No.

71
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:01,265
Everything eventually registers.
He'll chime in on this in a couple of days.

72
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,349
- Days?
- Days.

73
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,853
Hey, is Jackson in the house?
Let me hear you say...

74
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,938
- A new toy.
- Shameless.

75
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,580
- How's it going?
- I hate these books. Hate them.

76
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,706
No.

77
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,584
See that? They're trying to escape.
They hate me, too.

78
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,960
Your books don't hate you.

79
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,838
Rory, my brain is full.
It has reached capacity.

80
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,715
It's Shea Stadium
when the Beatles played.

81
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,010
It's cramped, girls are screaming,
and George is fighting with Ringo.

82
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,222
- You have a very active head.
- I cannot ingest any more information.

83
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,723
- Take a break.
- I don't have time.

84
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,225
Close your eyes, clear your head.

85
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,018
Clearing my head just means that...

86
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,522
all the knowledge I have painstakingly
stuffed in there will leak out.

87
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,234
In order to make room for stuff,
I lose stuff. It's a very vicious circle.

88
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,693
I'll make some coffee.

89
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,779
- I hate finals.
- Nobody likes finals.

90
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,823
Thank God I'm graduating
and it's the last time I cram like this.

91
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,742
My pursuit of higher education
has led me...

92
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,578
to an interesting discovery about myself.
You wanna hear it?

93
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,248
- Sure.
- I despise academics.

94
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,043
Learning, knowledge, it's all worthless.
I have no idea what you see in it.

95
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,086
Learning is fun.

96
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,214
Plus, for me, there's that
I'm a minor, so it's mandatory thing.

97
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,133
That's what kills me. This is self-inflicted.
I'm a masochist.

98
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:04,012
I might as well be carrying a switch and
periodically lacerating myself with it.

99
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,391
That diploma hanging on the wall
is going to make this all worthwhile.

100
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,562
I guess. Unless I turn into John Nash
and start drooling on people.

101
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,023
- You're graduating.
- I know.

102
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,402
No, you're graduating.
There's gonna be a ceremony.

103
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,113
I don't know. It's a community college.

104
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,656
Community colleges have ceremonies.

105
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,368
My college doesn't even have a lawn.
They won't necessarily have a ceremony.

106
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,620
- They must. Did you ask?
- No.

107
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:33,625
Well, now that you mention it,
I think someone said something about...

108
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,503
some cheesy ceremony
for my business class.

109
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,464
- When is it?
- I don't know. Next Thursday.

110
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,925
- That's great. You have to do it.
- I don't know.

111
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,468
- You have to do it.
- Really?

112
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,430
Yes. You've never been a part
of an actual graduation ceremony.

113
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,807
I know. That's because
my conservative high school...

114
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,935
wouldn't let me be in the ceremony
and nurse you at the same time.

115
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,937
- Don't be gross.
- You think I should do it?

116
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,940
- You've worked hard. You've earned it.
- I guess.

117
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,652
Come on. You know that deep down
you really want to do this.

118
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,280
I'll admit I've always wanted
to wear one of those gowns.

119
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,406
And the hat?

120
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,658
For the tassel.
You know my thing for fringe.

121
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,787
They call out your name,
and people clap, and you get your diploma.

122
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,416
Then you do that thing where you move
the tassel from one side to the other.

123
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,709
Very symbolic, very dramatic.

124
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,920
- That's it. You're doing it.
- If you insist.

125
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,214
- Who do you want to invite?
- I don't know. You.

126
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,007
- And?
- That's cool with me.

127
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,176
- Sookie and Jackson?
- That would be fun.

128
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,887
- And Grandma and Grandpa?
- Oh, no.

129
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,556
Come on. It's your graduation.
They should be there.

130
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,643
- Forget it. They won't want to be there.
- Of course they will.

131
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,854
Rory, I was supposed to graduate
from high school, go to Vassar...

132
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:40,317
marry a Yale man, get myself
a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny.

133
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,362
Instead, I got pregnant.
I didn't finish high school...

134
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,198
I didn't marry your father,
and I ended up in a career...

135
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,034
that apparently Jessica Hahn
would think was beneath her.

136
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,285
I humiliated them.

137
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,872
The two proudest people in the world,
and I humiliated them.

138
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,084
I spoiled their plans.
I took their fine upbringing...

139
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,671
in a world of comfort and opportunity,
and I threw it in their faces.

140
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,007
I broke their hearts,
and they'll never forgive me.

141
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,343
I guess I can't expect them to.

142
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,555
Maybe you're wrong about how they feel.
It was a long time ago.

143
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:14,393
Rory, I don't want them to go.
It'll just hurt them, and me.

144
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,562
- Okay?
- Okay.

145
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,233
- You should get back to your studying.
- Fine.

146
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,277
- Great.
- What?

147
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,488
I've already forgotten everything
I read in the last two hours.

148
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,031
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have.

149
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,159
In fact, I may have forgotten
everything I've ever known.

150
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,662
- Child, what be your name?
- Study.

151
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,876
Just explain the concept one more time.

152
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,586
And be mocked again? No, thank you.

153
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,546
- Come on.
- Maybe we're missing something.

154
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,590
You go to a special shooting range.

155
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,216
- A skeet shooting range.
- Right.

156
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,178
There's two of you,
and the guy with the gun yells, 'Pull. '

157
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:52,472
The other guy releases a clay pigeon
from a machine into the air...

158
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,891
and you try to shoot it.

159
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,435
- No, I don't think we're missing anything.
- I knew it.

160
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,061
- You shoot pigeons?
- Clay pigeons.

161
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,606
- When you hit them, does blood come out?
- They're clay.

162
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,149
And why do you like to do this?

163
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,028
My dad shot skeet when he was my age,
and he wants to pass the tradition down.

164
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,071
What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?

165
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,032
- Does that count?
- That's never happened.

166
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,910
What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon?
Does that count?

167
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,286
I've only done this once.

168
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,662
If you get really good...

169
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,916
do you move on to other animals,
like clay chickens and clay sheep?

170
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,959
We didn't go skeet shooting.
I made it all up.

171
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,753
I got to go in here.

172
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,130
- What do you need?
- Just general stuff.

173
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,467
- You guys go and be in love.
- See you back at the house.

174
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,428
What if you shoot the person
who throws the pigeon in the air?

175
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,471
Would that count?

176
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,978
Sorry.

177
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,814
No, I should have signaled or honked.
My fault.

178
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,569
I guess it was inevitable,
us running into each other.

179
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,030
- It's a very tiny community.
- I guess so.

180
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,575
- How's the diner?
- It's still there.

181
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,788
Yes. I knew that.
I'm able to empirically, with my eyes...

182
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,627
- Hey, Luke, do you think we could...
- I got to get back.

183
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,462
Okay. Right.

184
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,675
I'll get it.

185
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,512
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hello, Rory.

186
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,389
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

187
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,058
I'm thrilled to see you on no notice.

188
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,854
So tell me, what's this about?
You were so mysterious on the phone.

189
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,189
I wanted to talk to you
about something in person.

190
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,732
Well, come in.

191
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,613
It's an English tea service.

192
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,199
One of the advantages
of our having an English maid.

193
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,201
That, and the fact that she speaks English.

194
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,413
- You didn't have to do this.
- But it's teatime, and I wanted to...

195
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,958
Oh, no. Beatrice,
I told you to doily-line the plates.

196
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,960
You don't have to doily-line the plates.

197
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,920
- Hello.
- We're in the dining room.

198
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,174
- Rory, you're already here.
- You're out of breath.

199
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,051
- I ran over from the office.
- You didn't have to run.

200
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,013
Your grandmother said
you had something to discuss with us.

201
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,848
That certainly justifies a run.

202
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,350
All right, everybody, sit.

203
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,479
Pour the tea, Beatrice.

204
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,524
Actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on...

205
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,235
pouring the tea for just a minute?
Thank you very much.

206
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,864
Grandma, Grandpa,
I would like to propose an idea to you.

207
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,950
You can go for it or not.
It's entirely up to you.

208
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,245
But I would like for you to promise me
that you will not get upset.

209
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,330
We won't get upset.

210
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,082
- And you will try to keep an open mind.
- All right.

211
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,669
And you will let me finish my presentation
completely before you respond.

212
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,713
She's been hanging around you
far too much.

213
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,217
Rory, we accept your terms.
Please proceed.

214
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,593
Thank you.

215
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,888
First, let me start by saying
that Mom doesn't know I'm here.

216
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:42,476
She'd probably be mad if she knew
that I was, but I feel this is important.

217
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,020
As you know,
Mom's been going to business school...

218
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,189
at the community college
for three years now.

219
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,524
I believe she's mentioned it.

220
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,652
She's doing very well
and she's finishing up.

221
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,906
Actually, she's graduating Thursday,
and there's going to be a ceremony.

222
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,784
I think it would mean a lot to her
if you guys were there.

223
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,994
It may not seem like it would, but it's true.

224
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,248
If it would mean so much to her,
why didn't she invite us herself?

225
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,124
'Cause she didn't think you'd want to go.

226
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,794
And I get that, but I think it's a mistake.

227
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,295
I had a school thing once.

228
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,298
I wasn't sure if Mom would want to go,
so I didn't invite her.

229
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,884
It was my kindergarten
Salute To Vegetables pageant...

230
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,762
and I was Broccoli
and I did a tap dance with Beets.

231
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:22,474
And the entire number,
I was just thinking, 'Mom's not here. '

232
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,977
And it was my fault that she wasn't there.

233
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,688
Well, it was kind of a life lesson for me.

234
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,065
Now, if the thought
of going to Mom's graduation...

235
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,277
upsets you, or makes you unhappy,
or uncomfortable in any way...

236
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,070
then please don't go.

237
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,698
Because this is
an important night for Mom...

238
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,493
and if you go, you should go
under the right circumstances.

239
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,499
Those are the tickets.
It's Thursday, 7:00 p. m.

240
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,295
It's indoors, so weather's not an issue.
You can use them or not.

241
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,714
No hard feelings. Do what you feel is best.

242
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:57,676
And, if you don't mind,
I would really appreciate it...

243
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,679
if you would keep this conversation
between the three of us.

244
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,099
That's all I have to say.
Thanks very much for your patience.

245
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,644
I believe I have time for a scone
before my bus leaves.

246
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,898
Beatrice, the tea, please.

247
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,358
Emily, these look delicious.

248
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,028
So, Richard, how was your day today?

249
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:20,741
I am feeling so good, sister,
because it's over.

250
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,704
No more finals, no more studying,
no more school. The pressure's off.

251
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,290
Do you know how much pressure I felt?
Do you?

252
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,211
All last week, I felt like a giant man
and his brother were sitting on my chest.

253
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,962
- A giant man?
- And his giant brother.

254
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:37,090
- Did they have names?
- Clem and Clem. Same names.

255
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,760
Which did not reflect well
on their mothers' imagination.

256
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,553
- Mother.
- Mothers. There were two Clems.

257
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,056
- 'Cause they were brothers.
- Yes, so they had mothers.

258
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,891
You're drawing me
into your drunken world.

259
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,310
It's not a bad place to be, my friend.

260
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,853
Tank's empty.

261
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,106
- What is this?
- What?

262
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,317
This life plan book thing.

263
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,738
A gift for the grads from the happy people
at Hartford Community College.

264
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,324
Hey, how many margaritas
is too many margaritas?

265
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,743
If you can't remember
where the living room is.

266
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:05,953
I'm still good.

267
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,956
Okay, here's an interesting question
for you.

268
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,794
'Have you given any thought to how
children will work into your future plans?'

269
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,880
They're not gonna stand in my way,
that's for sure.

270
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,133
I plan to have some, of course,
but I'm just gonna knock them out...

271
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,636
and have nanny catch them
and care for them...

272
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,847
make sure Mick Jagger
doesn't come near them...

273
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,765
and then return them to me
when they're 21.

274
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,141
What about me?

275
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,895
You are my favorite eldest child.
You get to stay by my side.

276
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,772
I feel so privileged.

277
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,440
I'll get it.

278
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,945
Now, if that's Mick Jagger, hang up,
and blow that whistle I gave you.

279
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,657
- Hello.
- Hi.

280
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,119
- Hello?
- Hi.

281
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,453
Is this a bad time?

282
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,789
No. Just hold on a sec.

283
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,002
The music. I'll be right back.

284
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,801
- Hey.
- You said that already.

285
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,095
I did. You're right. Sorry.

286
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,139
- So, what's up?
- Nothing.

287
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,975
- What about you?
- Same.

288
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,312
So, what have you been doing?

289
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,648
Nothing much, just hanging out,
in the park mostly.

290
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,318
- Central Park?
- Washington Square Park.

291
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,154
It's cooler.
It's where David Lee Roth got busted.

292
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,573
Right. I hope he's got it together now.

293
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,617
Sounds like
you got a party going on there.

294
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,286
- No, it's just me and my mom.
- Right.

295
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,790
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.
This is long distance.

296
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,251
Yeah, it is long distance.

297
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,338
So, see you.

298
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,715
Yeah. See you.

299
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,521
Mom? What's wrong?

300
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,939
I'm experiencing frustration.

301
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:00,651
At the general state of things in the world
or something in particular?

302
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,361
What do you wear to a graduation?

303
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,321
- A cap and gown.
- I mean underneath.

304
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,198
Whatever you want.
The gown will cover it.

305
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,242
It's complicated.
I don't want to overdress...

306
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,285
so I'm sweating if it's hot
in the auditorium.

307
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,913
But if I don't have enough on
and it's cold, I'll freeze.

308
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,249
It is complicated,
especially if you over think it.

309
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,333
I need a helpful comment.

310
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,461
Take light layers. Wear your
turquoise-and-tan dress you just got.

311
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,880
It's cool and it will look good
without your gown on.

312
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:25,384
Wear your turquoise sweater over it.
It will look great with the dress...

313
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,886
and it'll keep you warm
if it's cold in the auditorium.

314
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,305
- You are a fashion genius.
- You taught me everything.

315
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,891
- My brain's not working.
- You're excited. It's a big day.

316
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,184
What time will you get there?

317
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,937
I have newspaper stuff after school.
But no later than 6:00.

318
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,231
- We'll go out to eat after?
- Anyplace. It's on me.

319
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,315
You don't have to do that.

320
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,150
You're a graduate.
You get to be pampered.

321
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:45,612
Then I'd like to go to Chateau
Jean Georges La Jean Georges in Paris.

322
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,282
I'll look it up in Daggit
and book the Concorde. I got to go.

323
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,491
I got to get ready.

324
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:53,996
Wait, I wanna see my little graduate
one more time before the big event.

325
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,623
Do I look like I'm ready
to make my way in the world?

326
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,292
If all else fails, you can marry rich.

327
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,043
I love that we always have that option.

328
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,420
What'll you do with your hair?

329
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,921
I got the curling iron warming up.

330
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,799
Mom, the cap. You put it on,
it's gonna smoosh the curls down.

331
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,051
- You are a genius.
- See you tonight.

332
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,930
Try to seat us next to a celebrity
on the Concorde, like Sting or someone.

333
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,265
I'll try.

334
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,268
- I told her, 'Look, missy... '
- You called your advisor 'missy?'

335
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,394
It was attitudinal.

336
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:20,814
I said, 'I'm not taking AP Calculus
from Henemen. I'm going with Branch.

337
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,692
'Branch is a graduate of MIT,
and Henemen went to Berkeley.

338
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,070
'He may have majored in Math,
but what did he minor in, bean sprouts?'

339
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,574
I'm telling my advisor all this
and I look in her trash can...

340
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,452
and there's this half-eaten banana in there.
Nothing else.

341
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,414
I pictured her sitting in this shoebox
of an office, eating a banana by herself...

342
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,916
and I almost felt sorry for her.

343
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,169
Then she questioned my judgment
about Berkeley, so I eviscerated her.

344
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,339
She was welling up at the end,
but she held it in until I was gone.

345
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,592
I have enough faculty recommendations
to run for Student Council...

346
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,470
so I don't need her anyway.
My locker's this way.

347
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,145
- Are they closed?
- They're closed.

348
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,688
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

349
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:05,442
Okay, one second, and open.

350
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,612
You made me a tassel-hat cake.

351
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,115
Filled with two pounds of crushed
chocolate-covered espresso beans.

352
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,825
- You're evil.
- And you're graduating.

353
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,994
- Yes, I am, aren't I?
- Here.

354
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,498
I brought the pictures you wanted
to see of my high school graduation.

355
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,582
Hand them over, lady.

356
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,043
- Okay, but don't laugh.
- I promise.

357
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,629
I was younger then, not as refined.

358
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,673
- You're stoned.
- Totally.

359
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,133
- I thought you hated that.
- It was peer pressure.

360
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:33,387
If Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke,
you took it or took off.

361
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,180
Gilbert had a snappy slogan.

362
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,015
I was nauseous all day.

363
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,183
Your parents?

364
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,019
For the traditional,
parents flanking their graduate child.

365
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,313
- Don't they look proud?
- They do. Very proud.

366
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,481
What is that?

367
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,900
It's pictures
of Sookie's high school graduation.

368
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,861
What was
your high school graduation like?

369
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,488
It was dignified,
as most French ceremonies are.

370
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,534
Poetry was read, a string quartet played,
a ballerina performed.

371
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:59,580
Drank Boone's Farm out of a bota bag
and knocked a beach ball around?

372
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,790
I don't understand half of what you say.

373
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,625
That's why we work.

374
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,172
- Hello.
- Hey, Lor, how you doing?

375
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,716
Christopher. I'm good. I'm excited.

376
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,260
You should be. It's a big day.
Did you get my present?

377
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,013
- What present?
- A basket. You should've gotten it by now.

378
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:19,224
- Did a basket come for me?
- It came. It was heavy.

379
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,352
I felt a twinge,
so I dropped it for health reasons.

380
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,396
It's probably still intact.

381
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,024
My cracked staff
has just informed me of its arrival.

382
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,942
I'm going to find it.

383
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,907
I put it together myself.

384
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,409
- And it's all for me?
- All for you.

385
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,247
A $25 savings bond.

386
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,624
That's a long-term investment.

387
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,210
Don't touch it for 30 years,
you're looking at $45.

388
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,253
- A youth hostel card.
- For the young girl...

389
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,589
who doesn't mind
sharing a bathroom with strangers.

390
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,800
'What Color Is Your Parachute?
A practical manual for job hunters. '

391
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,929
Helping you answer: What you wanna do
and where you wanna do it.

392
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,057
A DVD of The Graduate. Got to have that.
The Portable Nietzsche.

393
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,183
Light, cheery reading.

394
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,019
An application to join the armed forces.

395
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,105
If your dreams don't pan out,
it's a viable option.

396
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,067
And something in a nice little velvet box.

397
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,821
A necklace. The pearl almost looks real.

398
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,366
It better look very real, because it is.

399
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,993
- That's not funny.
- This is not a funny gift.

400
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:24,248
Christopher, this is extremely not funny.
This is totally humorless.

401
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,041
It's beautiful.

402
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,543
I think you're awesome, Lor.

403
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,462
With everything you do,
and raising Rory the way you did...

404
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,172
you're superwoman.

405
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,423
Have a great day.

406
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,801
Wish I could be there.
Take lots of pictures for me.

407
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,761
The camera. I forgot the camera.

408
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,596
Look in the basket.

409
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,724
You thought of everything.

410
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:44,476
- Have a great night.
- Thanks.

411
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,770
You, too. Bye.

412
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,627
Could you...

413
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,339
Excuse me. Sir, do you know...

414
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,759
Excuse me.
Do you know where Washington...

415
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,970
Excuse me, ma'am.
Washington Square Park?

416
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,055
- End of Fifth.
- Thank you.

417
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,643
Excuse me. Where's Fifth?

418
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:35,819
Hi.

419
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,073
How you doing?

420
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,160
- Good. How about you?
- Good.

421
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,289
- You hungry?
- Starved.

422
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,333
I know a place.

423
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,176
I feel very urban today.

424
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,595
Yeah, the plaid just screams urban.

425
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,640
- I think I look like a native.
- How well do you know Manhattan?

426
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:07,100
I've been here a few times.
We saw the Bangles here.

427
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,477
When was that, 20 years ago?

428
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,188
- It was a reunion, and they were great.
- They're okay.

429
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,273
A couple of years ago,
Mom drove us in to shop.

430
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:17,236
She couldn't find a good parking place,
and all of the lots were total rip-offs.

431
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,571
So she kept making u-turns
and cutting off taxis...

432
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,449
and we were being screamed at
in so many different languages...

433
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,409
that we just turned around
and drove home...

434
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,912
and bought a Hummel
at the curio shop in Stars Hollow.

435
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,163
Very adventurous.

436
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,666
I'm just saying I'm no stranger
to the Big Apple.

437
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,876
You are if you're calling it the Big Apple.

438
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,754
So I don't have the lingo down yet,
but I have the attitude.

439
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,089
- You do?
- Yeah.

440
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,383
When I was getting a locker
for my backpack...

441
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,761
at the bus stop there was this guy
just standing there staring at me.

442
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:46,598
And instead of ignoring him,
I fixed him with a really withering stare.

443
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,517
- That I've got to see.
- No.

444
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,811
Come on. Let me see your withering stare.

445
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,646
It's dangerous. I could hurt you.

446
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,857
- I've been hurt before.
- No.

447
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,401
I'm disappointed.

448
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,698
- So, your arm's okay?
- Yeah. It looks worse than it is.

449
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,076
I like this Emily chick. A friend of yours?

450
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,954
She's a friend to all of us dispossessed.

451
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,957
- So here's our lunch place.
- A hot-dog stand?

452
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,418
I eat here everyday.
It's nothing fancy, but...

453
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,837
- No, I love it. It's perfect.
- Good.

454
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,174
- One with everything on it.
- Make that two, please.

455
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,718
So, how's...

456
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,429
- Luke?
- Yeah.

457
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:26,930
Okay.

458
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,391
- He went fishing.
- Fishing?

459
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,435
Yeah. He didn't catch anything though.

460
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,520
- He probably used the wrong bait.
- Yeah.

461
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:36,315
That's a common fishing blunder.

462
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,568
So he's good?

463
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,653
Yeah, he's good.

464
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:45,115
I can tell him hello for you if you want.

465
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,492
Whatever.

466
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,536
Thank you.

467
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,752
- My God. This is really good.
- I'm glad you like it.

468
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,671
- So, how much time you got?
- I got a bit.

469
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,673
There's a record store
you should check out.

470
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,510
It's run by this insane freak
who's a walking encyclopedia...

471
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:07,679
for every punk and garage band record
ever made.

472
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:11,183
Catalog numbers. He's crazy.
The place is right out of High Fidelity.

473
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,851
- Let's go.
- Okay.

474
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,604
Where you going?

475
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,814
- Subway.
- I thought we were gonna walk.

476
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,692
It's 15 blocks.
Come on, I think you'll like it.

477
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:24,947
- Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?
- You are so an out-of-towner.

478
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,844
Excuse me. Hi. I'm one of the graduates.

479
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,887
Wow. You're hours early.

480
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,682
I just wanted to beat traffic...

481
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,476
and have time to get ready and relax
and also I've heard...

482
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,896
the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns
without the mysterious stains.

483
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:01,108
- This is true. Take your pick.
- Thank you.

484
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:08,198
This is so exciting. Isn't this exciting?

485
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,284
This is my eighth year of doing this.

486
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,870
So not so exciting for you. Got it.

487
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:35,100
You're being so cryptic.
Do you need a power source or not?

488
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:39,146
My batteries are all fully charged.
It just depends on how fast they deplete.

489
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:42,024
- So we need one just in case.
- Mom.

490
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:46,361
Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony.
What are you doing here?

491
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:49,615
I'm sorry, what are you doing here?
How do you even know about this?

492
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,409
I shouldn't know about this?
A mother can't know about this?

493
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,411
- No, I just mean...
- You're graduating.

494
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,830
- I know.
- So we're here to see you graduate.

495
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:58,415
This is Raul.

496
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,210
So you and Raul
are just here to see me graduate.

497
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,629
Don't be silly.
Your father will be joining me later.

498
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:06,715
- My father?
- Yes. Remember him? Tall, bow tie.

499
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,636
I remember Dad, Mom. I just...
Rory told you.

500
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,639
Yes. That's okay, isn't it?
It's a little late if it's not.

501
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,351
No, it's perfectly fine that you're here.
Absolutely. I'm just surprised.

502
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,061
- Who are you?
- I'm Raul.

503
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:22,147
- I just told you that.
- Did Rory invite Raul, too?

504
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,066
Raul is my cameraman.

505
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,485
Cameraman?

506
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,863
He'll be filming the ceremony for us.
He's very talented.

507
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:34,409
He screened an independent film of his
as an audition. Welcome to Scabland.

508
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:36,912
It was disgusting,
but beautifully photographed.

509
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,665
- It was supposed to be disgusting.
- I'm sure it was.

510
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,291
Mom, all this stuff.

511
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:44,294
Excuse me. All of this equipment,
it can't be here.

512
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:47,714
We won't leave all of this equipment here
for everybody to trip over.

513
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,007
We are not cretins.

514
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,343
She's handling it.
Right, Mom, you are handling it?

515
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:54,179
- This lighting sucks.
- Can we do something about the lighting?

516
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,265
I don't think so, ma'am. I don't know.

517
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,476
It's a community college,
we'll have to cope. Think documentary.

518
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,521
Mom, please.
People will be showing up here soon.

519
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:05,482
Lorelai, I'm perfectly capable
of handling this.

520
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:07,734
No one will be inconvenienced.

521
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:11,822
Okay. I'm just gonna
let everyone deal with all of this...

522
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:14,575
because I need to relax
and get a cup of coffee...

523
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,952
and maybe hammer a nail into my head.

524
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:20,747
You're not needed here, Lorelai.
Go get your coffee. Relax.

525
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,793
You're going to redo
your makeup later, aren't you?

526
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,753
Maybe an Irish coffee.

527
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,927
I haven't even heard of half these bands.

528
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:37,723
I love that about this place.
Lane would want to live here.

529
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,310
Who's Slint?

530
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,730
- I don't know.
- Grunge band out of Kentucky.

531
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:48,734
Two albums plus a double 'A' side single.
Disbanded in '94.

532
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,402
Thanks.

533
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,075
- My God.
- What?

534
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,536
- Look.
- The Go-Go's.

535
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,581
- You must have that one.
- No. For my mom.

536
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,417
This was her favorite group
when she was my age.

537
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:06,919
It's signed by Belinda.

538
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,254
This would be
the perfect graduation present.

539
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,299
I've been looking all week long,
and I couldn't find anything.

540
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,384
- Now I have Belinda.
- Graduation?

541
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,386
From college. From business classes.

542
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,263
I'm surprised she has time for anything...

543
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,225
except lighting darts on fire
and throwing them at my picture.

544
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,393
It's not a lot of time, but...

545
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:27,314
- Go on. Get it. She'll like it.
- Thank you so much for bringing me here.

546
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,274
- This was fate.
- I think it was.

547
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:32,152
And in return,
I just might show you my withering stare.

548
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,862
I'm a lucky man.

549
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,665
- I think this one's mine.
- Yep. The sign says 'Booneville. '

550
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:48,335
Excuse me. I'm so sorry to bother you.
Which way is 44th?

551
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,587
- That way.
- Great. Thanks.

552
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,298
- I got asked directions.
- I saw.

553
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,676
He took me for a native. That's so cool.

554
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,762
That's very impressive.
44th is the other way.

555
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,138
- No.
- It's all right.

556
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,890
Man, I should go find him.

557
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:04,810
He'll figure it out when he sees
the numbers getting smaller.

558
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,770
He still thought I was a native. That's cool.

559
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,146
I'm your witness.

560
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,232
- Well, I should go.
- Okay.

561
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,235
I got to go to my mom's graduation.

562
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,280
- And give her Belinda.
- And give her Belinda.

563
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,574
Go on. I'll check on the guy.

564
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:22,286
I'll make sure he's not
wandering around looking for 44th.

565
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,837
Why did you come here?

566
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:36,258
- What?
- I said, why did you come here?

567
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:41,138
You ditched school and everything.
That's so not you. Why'd you do it?

568
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:45,309
Because you didn't say goodbye.

569
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,523
Goodbye, Rory.

570
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:53,400
Bye, Jess.

571
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,835
- Great. I'm Woody Allen in Annie Hall.
- You thought ahead. Smart.

572
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,879
The mirror. Yeah.

573
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,215
I never leave home
without all the essentials:

574
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:18,842
Mirror, makeup, picture of Shaun Cassidy.

575
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:21,595
- I'm done. Do you want to use it?
- Thanks.

576
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,265
- Don't I look charming?
- You look great.

577
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:28,727
I looked better. I had to run here
straight from work. Kinko's.

578
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,312
Hey, Liza. That gets me thinking.

579
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:33,565
Maybe you and I ought to do
a little reproducing after the ceremony.

580
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:35,108
- Clever.
- Don't be a snot.

581
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,401
Shut up.

582
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:38,946
- That's my boyfriend, Zach.
- Sure.

583
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:42,032
We're breaking up'cause
we're transferring to different schools.

584
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,201
He's going to Florida State.
I'm going to UMass.

585
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,078
Although I'm gonna miss this place.

586
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:49,164
- I'm not. This place stunk. It's bush-league.
- Why'd you go here?

587
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:52,584
My parents, wise investors that they are,
couldn't afford anything else.

588
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:56,129
Yeah, that 2.0 grade-point average
didn't reason into things.

589
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:57,506
- Shut up.
- Between the lines.

590
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:58,757
Go die.

591
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:03,136
Sure you don't wanna give it another go,
'cause you're darling together?

592
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,722
- Thanks for the mirror.
- My pleasure.

593
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:10,894
Hey, a bunch of us are
going to Shaky's afterwards for pizza.

594
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,312
You want to come?

595
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:15,399
I'm going out with my daughter after,
but it sounds like fun.

596
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,944
You won't believe this. There's some
blue-blooded rich woman out there...

597
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:22,406
setting up professional film equipment
like she's shooting a movie.

598
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:24,658
- You're kidding.
- Whose mother is it?

599
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,619
I don't know. Little precious
must be around here somewhere.

600
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:31,498
- I hate people with money.
- So do I, with every fiber of my being.

601
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:33,959
Me, too. Money people.

602
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,808
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

603
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,061
- Are we leaving soon?
- I have no idea.

604
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,063
Should you have an idea?

605
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,649
There was an accident,
closed the interstate.

606
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:00,652
All outbound buses
were told to stand down.

607
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:04,615
And you don't know when
we're gonna be allowed to stand up again?

608
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,576
Soon, I hope. I hate missing dinner.

609
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:09,828
Yeah. Me, too.

610
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:24,510
There's our little graduate.
My God, look at that gown.

611
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,428
You look just like the Statue of Liberty.

612
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,348
- All big and stony?
- No. You look amazing.

613
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,641
You look very GQ.

614
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,185
Thanks to my best new friend
Ermenegildo Zegna.

615
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,187
Don't you love
how he can pronounce it now?

616
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,271
Very cosmopolitan.

617
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:39,107
He got it for the rehearsal dinner.
It's his first real suit.

618
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,026
And not my last. I look hot.

619
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,153
You know that Emily's out there, right?

620
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:44,363
Why?

621
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:47,533
- It's a long story. Just do me a favor.
- Sure.

622
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,619
Keep an eye on my parents.
Make sure they don't disrupt anything.

623
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:53,872
My mother doesn't behead anyone.
My father doesn't snore too loudly.

624
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:56,542
- They won't do anything like that.
- Haven't you met them?

625
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,628
- Why would they do that?
- They're here because Rory invited them.

626
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:02,339
They can't say no to that little face.

627
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:05,008
It's like hitting a puppy
with a rolled-up newspaper.

628
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:06,927
You guys are not gonna believe this.

629
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,389
- You're Mr. Announcement Guy today.
- You'll pipe in every time I talk?

630
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,431
- Can it.
- Stuff it.

631
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:12,599
- They're in love.
- Clearly.

632
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:16,645
Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has
a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too.

633
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,939
It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there.

634
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,315
That's Emily, right?

635
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,985
- Rich people feel so entitled.
- Yes, damn them.

636
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,112
I saw her wipe her face with a $100 bill.

637
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:28,157
We should line them up against a wall.
You know what I'm saying?

638
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,617
- Is Lorelei Gilmore here?
- Yes.

639
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,620
Good. Have a look at these, will you?

640
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:37,040
- Wow. Pretty.
- Look them over and take your pick.

641
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,292
- What for?
- To wear.

642
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,086
- Are they for sale?
- No. They're paid for.

643
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,297
These are from your mother,
Emily Gilmore.

644
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,632
- Wow. Ritzy.
- I really don't want to wear a corsage.

645
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,718
- They're all paid for.
- Really. It's too much.

646
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,262
- Your mother wants you to pick one.
- Really, it's okay.

647
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,889
She'll just come back here herself.

648
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,266
- This one, thanks.
- Good choice.

649
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:57,477
The cameraman said
that would look best on film.

650
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,939
- So you're the rich girl.
- Maybe. I'm not rich...

651
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,734
but my parents have money.
But I'm totally self-sufficient.

652
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:07,279
I take nothing from them except
this corsage and my daughter's tuition.

653
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,364
So, are you gonna stone me?

654
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,283
I should've guessed. Look at her friends.

655
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,993
They're wearing suits that drip money.

656
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,912
Hey, pal, this was 30% off.

657
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:18,081
That's why you didn't want to get pizza
'cause it's below you?

658
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:20,542
No, Liza. Pizza is not below me.

659
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:24,963
I love pizza. I eat tons of pizza.
It's one of my four major food groups.

660
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,090
Candy, popcorn, and pizza.

661
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:30,093
See. It's two of my food groups.
That's how much I love pizza.

662
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:31,220
I want to believe you.

663
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:34,097
Enjoy your champagne and caviar
at the Ritz, Your Highness.

664
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,599
I am not rich.

665
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:38,644
My pager.

666
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:42,481
- Maybe this suit was a little much.
- You're a fox. Now, don't start.

667
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:43,982
- No.
- What?

668
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,859
- Rory's running late.
- Late from what?

669
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,069
She doesn't say.

670
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:50,823
She'll be here, but if she's not here
by 7:00, she'll sneak in the back.

671
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,866
- That's weird.
- She'll be here. Don't worry.

672
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,951
I hope so.

673
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,995
We'll sit in back, keep an eye out for her,
and save her a seat.

674
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,499
Can you hang on to all my stuff for me?
I don't want to leave it in here.

675
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,334
- Will do.
- Thank you.

676
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,502
Bye.

677
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:06,213
You don't trust your valuables
around us poor kids?

678
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,048
Knock it off, Zach.

679
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,811
You don't look happy.

680
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,522
- I'm late.
- These buses are the worst.

681
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,315
Why are we making so many stops?

682
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:27,693
The bus didn't make stops
on the way into the city.

683
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:32,114
That was probably an express.
This is a local. It makes a lot of stops.

684
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:35,325
I should have checked the schedule.
I should have checked traffic.

685
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:38,370
Note to self:
Lmpulsive definitely does not work for me.

686
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,205
What are you doing?

687
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:43,500
- It's for my spit.
- Your what?

688
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,294
For my smokeless.

689
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:51,383
Victor David Fuller.

690
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:56,221
Nancy Brenda Gatson.

691
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:04,521
Making sure the camera's
getting your best side, princess?

692
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,483
Are you telling me that that is
the best commencement speaker...

693
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:09,610
they can scrounge up?

694
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,653
I hope RauI's getting
enough shots of Lorelai.

695
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,072
I don't want the whole damn ceremony
and none of her.

696
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:17,201
I disagree. I hope he gets
every inspired word...

697
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:21,288
articulated by the East Coast
Marketing Director of Pup 'n' Taco.

698
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,338
Oh, jeez.

699
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,966
John Lawrence Gilfer.

700
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:38,096
Lorelai Victoria Gilmore.

701
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,333
Hey. Mom, Dad.

702
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,126
Lorelai.

703
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,921
- Well, I did it.
- Yes.

704
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,591
Raul thinks he got some good footage.

705
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,635
I should hope so. He certainly cost enough.

706
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:17,803
I'm sure it'll be great.

707
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:20,389
- Congratulations, Lorelai.
- Thank you.

708
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,349
I'm glad you guys came.

709
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,768
Yes, well, we should get going.

710
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,938
I guess we'll see you tomorrow for dinner.

711
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:31,984
Hey, wait.

712
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,319
- Aren't we gonna take a picture?
- Excuse me?

713
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,114
The three of us.
Me in the middle with the gown.

714
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:39,158
You know, the traditional pose.

715
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,327
Well, we don't have a camera with us.

716
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,163
Hold on.

717
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,833
- That's a camera?
- That's a camera.

718
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,501
It looks like a toy.

719
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:51,420
Raul, would you mind?

720
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:03,974
Okay, on the count of one, two, three.

721
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:05,475
Cheese.

722
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:09,813
Thank you.

723
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,691
Yes, well, tomorrow then.

724
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:14,568
Absolutely.

725
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:16,653
Let's go, Richard.

726
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,364
I'll be right there, Emily.

727
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,744
Congratulations.

728
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:28,457
- You don't have to do this.
- Put it towards something fun.

729
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,959
Thank you, Daddy.

730
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:39,343
- We're so proud of you.
- Yeah. You were great up there.

731
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:41,720
Thanks, you guys. Where's Rory?

732
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,891
- No Rory?
- She called your cell, and I answered.

733
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:49,102
She said she got hung up on something
and she'll see you at home.

734
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,189
Hung up where? Is she okay?

735
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,192
She said she's fine. She's sorry, but fine.

736
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:59,655
As long as she's okay, I guess.

737
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:03,075
Well, I should probably get the gown back.

738
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,702
Thanks for coming,
Sook, Marcus Schenkenberg.

739
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,830
You want to go out to eat?
Celebrate a little?

740
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:11,083
- I think I'll just go home to Rory.
- I thought so.

741
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,210
- See you tomorrow.
- Thanks.

742
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:17,339
Wait a minute.

743
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:20,926
Aspirins instead of Jordan almonds?
But we already bought the almonds.

744
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:23,804
Now, that's the longest
anything's ever taken.

745
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:26,974
My family's not gonna get the joke.
Can't we just use the almonds?

746
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:29,059
Okay, sweetie, calm down.

747
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,031
I'm so sorry.

748
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:44,575
- You're okay, right?
- Yes.

749
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,661
Everything's working.
Your wrist is okay. Nothing new is broken.

750
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:48,745
I'm fine.

751
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:51,248
Anyone you know,
like Lane, get sick today...

752
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,792
or break an arm themselves,
or get in a car wreck?

753
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,169
- No.
- Okay, good.

754
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:57,921
Then I can get past worried
and move on to the other things.

755
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,923
- I know you're hurt.
- You bet I'm hurt.

756
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,259
I really wanted you there today.
More than anything.

757
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:04,720
You're why I did this stupid thing
in the first place.

758
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,263
It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

759
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:07,389
You should've been there.

760
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,975
My best friend should have been there.
Whatever it was...

761
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,603
you should have gotten out of it.
At least this once.

762
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:14,771
- Was it school?
- It wasn't school.

763
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,440
- Was it Paris?
- It wasn't Paris.

764
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:17,900
- What was it?
- So stupid.

765
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,735
Where were you? What happened?

766
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,778
- I cut school.
- You what?

767
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,325
I cut school, and I got on a bus,
and I don't even know why I did it.

768
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:28,202
I have no excuse.

769
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:32,289
I was just standing outside of Chilton,
and I must have had a stroke.

770
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:35,584
- What does a stroke feel like?
- I don't know. Not good, probably.

771
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:39,046
I left school and I got on a bus
and I went to New York.

772
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:42,674
That's it. I'm grounded
for six months or seven.

773
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:44,801
And no TV, no stereo, no reading.

774
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,679
In fact, take all of my books away from me
and lock them up.

775
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:49,264
Hold on, you went to New York?

776
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:53,560
And no magazines, either.
I'll do all the housework. Laundry, dishes.

777
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:56,063
We're gonna start eating at home
so we have dishes.

778
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,106
Rory, stop. Why did you go to New York?

779
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,651
- To see Jess.
- Boy, do you know how to bury the lead.

780
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:03,612
- I don't know what happened.
- You went to New York to see Jess.

781
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:05,572
It was a stroke. It made me someone else.

782
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:08,408
- After his phone call last night...
- That was him?

783
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,494
...it did something to me.
I don't know what.

784
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,913
In fact, you should take the phone
away from me, too.

785
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:16,291
That's right. Add it to the list.
No books, no music, no phone.

786
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,461
- I'm a horrible person.
- You're not a horrible person.

787
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:22,464
I'm sick. I'm ill. I'm cracked.
This is not who I am.

788
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:25,467
If I were to write this down in my diary
and I would read it...

789
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:28,929
I would be like, 'Who is this freak?
This isn't me. This isn't my diary. '

790
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:32,182
I wouldn't skip school
when I had finals coming up...

791
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,059
to go see a guy that isn't even my guy...

792
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:38,188
and miss my mother's graduation,
which I wanted to be at so badly.

793
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,565
That's someone else.

794
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,860
That's someone flighty,
and stupid, and dumb, and girlie.

795
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:44,778
I mean, I missed your graduation...

796
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:47,489
which is the worst thing
I could have possibly done.

797
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:50,909
I hurt you,
and I had to spend hours on a stinky bus...

798
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:53,412
next to a guy
that was spitting into a can...

799
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:57,040
thinking about all the minutes going by
that I wasn't at your graduation...

800
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,126
and they were hurting you...

801
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:03,172
because it was so selfish of this person
who wasn't me to do what she did.

802
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:05,716
- Take a breath.
- I don't deserve a breath.

803
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:08,093
No breaths.
You should add that to the list.

804
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:11,763
You should beat me, ground me, take
the phone away, and deprive me of air.

805
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:14,975
Okay, look, nobody wants
to say this any less than me...

806
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:18,687
but maybe you don't have
a medical condition or a mental problem.

807
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,398
Maybe, honey, you are falling for Jess.

808
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:24,943
No. I love Dean. Dean is my boyfriend.

809
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:28,071
He will always be my boyfriend.
That's it. Forever.

810
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:30,741
- Maybe not forever.
- Yes. Forever. I love Dean.

811
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,160
Jess is gone now.
Everything's gonna be good again.

812
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:35,787
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Rory, you cut school.

813
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:39,917
You got on a bus and went to
a strange city in your uniform to see Jess.

814
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,043
I know.

815
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:43,545
That doesn't mean nothing.
That means something.

816
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:46,048
No. I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

817
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,966
The only thing I want to talk about...

818
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:51,678
is the list I made on the bus
of all the ways I'll make this up to you.

819
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:55,641
'You get total control over the remote
and the stereo for as long as you want.

820
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:57,768
'Total control over takeout food choices...

821
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,312
'and a special surprise present every day
for a month. '

822
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:03,899
- My God. I left your present on the bus.
- What present?

823
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:07,653
It was a vinyl copy of the Go-Go's
original album signed by Belinda.

824
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:10,280
But it's not the only copy.
I'm gonna find another copy.

825
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:11,782
That's going on the list, too.

826
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:14,368
Honey, please.
Forget about the list until tomorrow.

827
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:17,454
Okay, I'll just go to bed then.
I'll go to my room.

828
00:42:17,496 --> 00:42:19,248
Hold on one second.

829
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:21,250
Does this mean I have to eat alone?

830
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:24,002
It's up to you.
Sending me to bed without supper.

831
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:26,421
You can't lose with that punishment.
It's a classic.

832
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:28,340
I'd rather go out
with my daughter tonight.

833
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:31,677
- I don't deserve it.
- No. But I do.

834
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:34,221
Okay, just let me take a shower...

835
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,932
and get the horrible smell
of this horrible day off of me.

836
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:40,352
Then we'll go anywhere you want.
My treat. And I won't enjoy it.

837
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:42,771
Then we'll come home,
and I'll go straight to bed...

838
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:44,565
and have a terrible night's sleep, okay?

839
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:45,858
Sounds great.

840
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:51,613
I'm so, so sorry, Mom.

841
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:54,741
Really?

842
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:58,078
'Cause you didn't make that clear.

843
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:00,581
I won't be long.

844
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:43,707
English
