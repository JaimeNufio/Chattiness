1
00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:02,837
Hey, punch me in the stomach.

2
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:03,474
What ?

3
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:05,273
Real quick --
Jab, jab. Not too hard.

4
00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:06,931
Just enough to cause a
little internal bleeding.

5
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:08,133
That sounds pretty hard.

6
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:09,155
Yeah, true.

7
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:12,697
Plus, internal bleeding is internal,
which means it can't be proven.

8
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:15,067
And unless my mother sees blood,
there's no way she's gonna let you

9
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:16,351
take me to the hospital.
You're right.

10
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:18,461
You're gonna have to punch me in
the face. Real quick, jab, jab.

11
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:20,263
I am not going to
punch you in the face.

12
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:21,741
Why? I'll heal.

13
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:23,907
And I'd much rather spend the
night in the germy emergency room

14
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:26,550
getting 8 to 10 stitches
than go in there for dinner.

15
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:28,330
Plus, it'll give me
a really groovy scar.

16
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,322
- I've always wanted a groovy scar.
- Mom.

17
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:32,021
What? It'd be such a
great conversation piece.

18
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:33,411
"Where did you get
that groovy scar?"

19
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:36,000
"Oh, my daughter dropkicked
me for no apparent reason."

20
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:36,943
She's totally psycho.

21
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,242
Oh, so now I'm dropkicking you?

22
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:40,421
Giving you options. You didn't
like the whole jab, jab thing.

23
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,620
We haven't had dinner
with them in three weeks.

24
00:00:42,638 --> 00:00:43,920
Suck it up. We're going in.

25
00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:45,632
Hey, you didn't make it through
the last dinner, which means

26
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,203
technically, you've had four weeks,
which means you owe me one.

27
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:50,652
- I stayed for cocktail hour.
- That's the best part.

28
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,262
I can't help that it's
at the beginning.

29
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,160
Okay, fine,
then you stay through dessert,

30
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:56,050
and I'll leave early to
go spend time with Logan.

31
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:57,881
- Oh, I miss Logan.
- Yeah, me too.

32
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,971
Let's talk about him
for four or five hours.

33
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:01,943
- We're going inside.
- No! Gonna be horrible.

34
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:03,040
They're always horrible.

35
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:06,041
No, it's gonna be horribler
because of the whole Luke thing.

36
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:08,701
Doesn't your mom already kind of
know because of the house debacle?

37
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,800
No, she suspects,
but she doesn't know know.

38
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:11,851
I'm gonna have to tell them.

39
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:14,810
Well, just tell them real quick,
like ripping a band-aid off.

40
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,492
Like ripping a band-aid off
that's been superglued, stapled,

41
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:19,131
and surgically
embedded in my arm.

42
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,830
Just tell them,
and then we can move on.

43
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:24,122
We can talk about more pleasant things,
like the middle east.

44
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:25,710
I don't know how they're
gonna come at me, you know.

45
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:28,122
I know they're gonna come at me,
but I don't know how.

46
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:30,740
I mean, it could be guilt,
pity, anger, contempt.

47
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,843
They have so many options.

48
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:34,502
In all likelihood, it will be
a combination of all of those.

49
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:36,251
I don't want the whole
night to be about Luke.

50
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:37,732
It won't be. Don't worry.

51
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:40,341
Just put it out there,
and then when they attack you,

52
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:42,511
whatever angle they're coming from,
I will deflect.

53
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,282
- How will you deflect?
- Well, I don't know.

54
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:46,183
Maybe I will talk
about Bangalore.

55
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:47,740
You know a lot about Bangalore?

56
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:50,281
Don't you?
Bangalore? Outsourcing?

57
00:01:50,298 --> 00:01:52,221
You know, when you call customer
service, you're almost always talking

58
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:54,800
to some nice dude in India
who speaks perfect english.

59
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:55,913
Don't you read Time magazine?

60
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:57,622
It doesn't seem like
a rich subject area.

61
00:01:57,638 --> 00:01:59,221
- Yeah.
- No! Uhh!

62
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:02,190
Oh, I know. You tell them
you're converting to judaism,

63
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,472
and that will throw the
friday-night-dinner thing in jeopardy.

64
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:06,102
There you go.

65
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:08,580
Hello.

66
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,002
- Hi.
- Hello.

67
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:12,421
Come in. May I take your coats?

68
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:15,171
Well, okay. Here you go.

69
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:17,640
- That's a pretty dress.
- Thank you.

70
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:19,170
Oh.

71
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:21,323
- You okay there?
- I'm fine.

72
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:22,471
Right this way.

73
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:23,843
- Weird.
- So weird.

74
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:25,183
- It's a child, right?
- Pretty sure.

75
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:27,371
Maybe mom has run out of
adults who will work for her.

76
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,423
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

77
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:31,131
Good  evening, Rory. Lorelai.

78
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:32,571
Hi, grandma. Hi, grandpa.

79
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:35,691
Well done, Charlotte. C.C. guest
couldn't have done it better herself.

80
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:37,300
Thank you, Mrs. Gilmore.

81
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,360
Lorelai, Rory, allow me to
introduce Charlotte Courtwright.

82
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:44,070
Charlotte, this is Lorelai
Gilmore and Rory Gilmore,

83
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:45,620
my granddaughter
and her mother.

84
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:46,702
It's a pleasure to meet you.

85
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:48,363
Oh, a pleasure.

86
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,132
Hi.

87
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:52,310
Charlotte's grandparents, Arthur and
Beverly, are dear friends of ours.

88
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:55,762
In fact, it was the Courtwrights who
put us up for membership at blackledge.

89
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:56,810
Isn't that right, Richard?

90
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:58,733
Indeed it is,
although I have a feeling

91
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:01,993
Arthur did that just so he could
humiliate me on the links every sunday.

92
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,480
Hell of a golfer,
your grandfather.

93
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:06,692
Yes, he used to be scratch,
but now he's a 3.

94
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,850
You know, "Charlotte's web"
is one of my favorite books.

95
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,762
Spiders talking to pigs.
What could be better then that?

96
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:12,413
Can I offer anyone a cocktail?

97
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:14,930
Uh... okay. Sure.
Is that legal?

98
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,732
She'll have a
martini with a twist.

99
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:18,260
Scotch on the
rocks for Richard.

100
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:19,770
"G" and "T" for me. Rory?

101
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,341
Just a club soda, please.

102
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:23,922
Would you like that straight
up or on the rocks?

103
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,033
Straight up. Thanks.

104
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,732
You're never too young to
learn to make a martini.

105
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:30,951
Who is that?

106
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,562
I told you.

107
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,040
It's the Courtwrights'
granddaughter, Charlotte.

108
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:37,062
Why is she taking our coats
and pouring us drinks?

109
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:38,692
Did you win her
in a poker game?

110
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:41,512
Your mother has been dragooned
by her colleagues at the D.A.R.

111
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:44,362
to lend her expertise to this
year's summer cotillion.

112
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:46,202
It's been quite
a responsibility.

113
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:49,483
But Eliza Appleton insisted that
there was simply no one she knew

114
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:52,191
who was better suited to preparing
these girls for society living.

115
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,583
I could hardly say no.

116
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:54,270
Here we are.

117
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:56,722
- Oh. Thank you, Charlotte.
- Thank you.

118
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:59,293
- Martini straight up.
- Oh. Thanks.

119
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:00,233
Thank you.

120
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:02,540
So, nothing for you?
You driving tonight?

121
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:04,653
Oh, Lorelai, I'm only 10.

122
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:07,831
In any case, Charlotte missed last
week's session on table manners,

123
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,641
so we've decided to make
tonight's dinner a makeup class.

124
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:13,072
I'm awfully sorry about that,
Mrs. Gilmore.

125
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,632
My grandparents took me to a
Count Basie tribute at Tanglewood.

126
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:18,803
Charlotte, you might have noticed
that the ice cubes in my glass

127
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:20,003
have already melted.

128
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:23,233
There's a whole ice bucket up there.
There's no need to be so stingy.

129
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:24,780
I'm sorry.

130
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:28,102
For future reference.
It's obvious too late now.

131
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:31,270
This is your chance.
Get out while you still can.

132
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:33,532
I can show you all the
good escape routes.

133
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:37,192
Mrs.  Gilmore warned me you'd
be full of smart remarks.

134
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:35,032
Now, tonight we'll be dining
with service � la russe,

135
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:37,253
which has nothing to do with russians --
thank god --

136
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:40,300
because in my experience, their
table manners are nothing to emulate.

137
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:44,060
All it means is that the servers
will be passing each course in turn

138
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,172
instead of plopping all the
food on the table at once,

139
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:47,892
like some mukluk picnic.

140
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:50,530
Now, it is the duty of the gentleman
to help a lady to her seat.

141
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:52,053
- Richard, would you?
- It is my pleasure.

142
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:53,063
We can seat ourselves.

143
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:56,562
Yeah, seating us is more of a privilege,
not a duty.

144
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,443
Now, immediately upon sitting,

145
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:01,171
one should place one's
napkin in one's lap.

146
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:03,257
And, mind you,
no need for a flourish.

147
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:06,822
The ability to use a napkin
is nothing to brag about.

148
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,640
The table looks
beautiful, grandma.

149
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:09,593
Well, thank you, Rory.

150
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:11,011
What's with all the forks?

151
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:13,061
Every piece of silverware
has a purpose.

152
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:16,491
You simply work from the outermost
utensil in towards your plate.

153
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,010
Can you name each
of these forks?

154
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:20,490
Each one of these forks
is gonna take 20 minutes.

155
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:22,160
And then the fish fork,

156
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:24,143
and then the entr�e fork,

157
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:26,821
and then --
is this the dessert?

158
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,283
Oh, wait --
it's for the roast course, isn't it?

159
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,122
Exactly.  Very good, Charlotte.

160
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:32,942
Hey, you're gonna wow
them at your cotillion.

161
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:34,400
Did you ever attend
a cotillion?

162
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,352
No, I haven't, actually,
but I had a coming-out party.

163
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,170
And I totally
supported her decision.

164
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:41,120
She shouldn't have to
hide her love for women.

165
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:43,450
Lorelai, there's nothing
funny about being a lesbian.

166
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:45,241
I'm sure you'll have
fun at your cotillion.

167
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,252
I'm very much looking
forward to it.

168
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:50,220
Oh, don't get too excited.
Cotillions are not fun parties.

169
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:54,253
They're boring rituals to train
a whole new generation of snobs.

170
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:55,713
And how exactly would you know?

171
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:57,700
Lorelai never actually
attended a cotillion.

172
00:06:57,716 --> 00:07:00,731
You don't have to jump off the Empire
State Building to know it's gonna hurt.

173
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,132
Um, this looks delicious,
Mrs. Gilmore.

174
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,310
It's just a simple
potage au cresson.

175
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:07,420
I thought you were gonna
rip off the band-aid.

176
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:10,030
The kid threw me off. I'm looking
for an opening. I'll find it.

177
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:12,433
...to ladle the broth
away from our bodies.

178
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:14,961
Rory, how has the summer
been treating you so far?

179
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,271
It's treating me very well so far,
thank you.

180
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,772
Are you relaxing in preparation
for your senior year?

181
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,350
Well, I've been doing
some part-time work.

182
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:23,910
Paris opened this business,
a tutoring business,

183
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:26,292
and it prepares people
for the S.A.T.s.

184
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:28,781
It's kind of like the
princeton review but meaner.

185
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,321
Sounds very enterprising.

186
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,980
And what about your
social calendar?

187
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:34,113
Do you have anything
particularly exciting planned?

188
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,963
Not really.
Logan's in London, so...

189
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,831
Logan is Rory's boyfriend.
He's a Huntzberger.

190
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,751
How is Logan enjoying London?

191
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:44,062
I think he likes it.
He's working a lot

192
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:47,073
and meeting different department heads,
getting situated,

193
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:48,791
learning to talk british,
you know.

194
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,851
Lorelai, how's summer with you?
Anything new?

195
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:55,601
Um... we planted some
pansies at the Dragonfly,

196
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:57,602
in the back there.
They look good.

197
00:07:57,616 --> 00:08:02,220
And, um,
I finally bought a new dvd player.

198
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:04,193
And...

199
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:06,683
Luke and I broke up.

200
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,652
Did you? That's too bad.

201
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,560
Now, Charlotte,
when the conversation lags,

202
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:19,782
a good guest ought to be prepared
to introduce a new topic.

203
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:22,401
Keep it light --
no politics, no religion.

204
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:23,633
My little trick?

205
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:25,033
Just think of things
that you've read

206
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:27,551
in the middle three sections of
the sunday New York Times --

207
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:29,791
Travel, arts & leisure,
sunday styles --

208
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,670
And forget the rest
of the paper exists.

209
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:33,440
Look, it's all right.

210
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,640
- What is?
- We can talk about the breakup.

211
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:37,902
I'm sure you have
thoughts on the subject,

212
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,501
and why don't we get it
all out in the open now

213
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:42,773
so we can move on
with our lives?

214
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:44,121
I've moved on.

215
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:46,263
Richard, anything
you'd like to add?

216
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:48,163
I can't think of a thing.

217
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:49,763
All right, then.

218
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:51,633
Isn't it interesting
how they're renovating

219
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:53,721
so many of the old
paradores in Spain?

220
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:56,220
It's funny you should mention that
because last week at the club,

221
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:58,153
Chick Walsh told me
that he and Mary

222
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,063
stayed at this extraordinary
old castle near Madrid.

223
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:03,411
Where was it? Um, uh, Lerma.

224
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:05,042
Lerma? How nice.

225
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,241
Excuse me. Uh, what's going on?

226
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,983
Why are we talking about Lerma?

227
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:11,120
- It's a town in Spain.
- Yes, I understand geography,

228
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,551
but why are you avoiding
the subject of my breakup?

229
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:16,521
Honestly, Lorelai, I see no point
in continuing this conversation.

230
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:19,393
We couldn't possibly say anything right,
so why say anything at all?

231
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:20,523
That's not true.

232
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:21,732
It absolutely is.

233
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:23,350
You could say something.
You could try.

234
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,971
You could say,
"I'm sorry, Lorelai.

235
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:26,560
This must be a very
hard time for you."

236
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:28,301
Well, I am sorry, Lorelai.

237
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,130
I'm sure this is a very
hard time for you.

238
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,312
That's it? That's all?

239
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,032
I just said what
you said to say.

240
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:35,200
You don't have anything
of your own to add?

241
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:37,050
I'm  sure whatever Luke did --

242
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:39,323
See? It's so interesting,
because you blame it on him,

243
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:40,601
and you don't even
know the whole story.

244
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:41,233
Mom...

245
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:42,490
I knew we couldn't
talk about this.

246
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,092
I should have claimed
I had laryngitis.

247
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:46,812
Lorelai, your mother is
simply expressing our regrets

248
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:48,543
that you've ended your
relationship with Luke.

249
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:50,302
I hardly see how
that's offensive.

250
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,050
Fine.

251
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:55,512
Only that's not true.
You never liked Luke.

252
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:58,151
You never showed him
anything but total contempt.

253
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:00,593
That's not true.
I played golf with Luke.

254
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:01,413
Once.

255
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,152
We were planning on buying
the two of you a house.

256
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:06,233
Doesn't the fact that we were willing
to spend an enormous amount of money

257
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:08,103
on a wedding present
count for anything?

258
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:09,073
So, that's what
you're mad about?

259
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:11,350
You're mad about the enormous amount
of money you might have wasted?

260
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:11,981
Mom!

261
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,340
That's not what I was saying.

262
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:14,500
Well, you implied it.

263
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:17,240
- Lorelai, this--
- Bangalore! Bangalore!

264
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:18,973
Bangalore.

265
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:29,461
- Hi.
- Morning, Ace.

266
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:30,193
Thanks.

267
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:31,442
How's your day going?

268
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:34,361
My day hasn't started yet.
How was your yesterday?

269
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm still sleepy.

270
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,623
I can let you go back to sleep.

271
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,552
No, no, I'm up.

272
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm up.

273
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,421
What  happened yesterday?

274
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:44,240
My yesterday or your yesterday?

275
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:45,061
Either one.

276
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,440
Let's see...
I had a scone for breakfast --

277
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:50,453
not as dry as monday's, but I still
think there's room for improvement.

278
00:10:50,468 --> 00:10:53,170
And then I went into a meeting with
about 18 different department heads,

279
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:54,811
all of whom I believe
are named Nigel,

280
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:57,440
and that meeting lasted
for about nine hours.

281
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,851
Was it a cranberry scone?

282
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,870
Blueberry.

283
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:01,282
Those are my favorite kind.

284
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:02,061
Your turn.

285
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:04,763
Well, I'm tutoring
this new kid, Benji.

286
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:08,402
And, oh, it was really funny
because he kept misusing this word.

287
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,772
I don't remember what word it was,
but it'll come to me.

288
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:13,401
Anyway, he kept misusing it,
and I didn't want to correct him

289
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,142
'cause I didn't want
him to feel embarrassed.

290
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:17,080
But then he messed up
on the work sheet,

291
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:20,703
and then he realized all by himself
that he had misused the word.

292
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:23,401
I guess it wasn't
funny "ha ha."

293
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,882
It was more funny "you
had to be there."

294
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:27,341
That's okay.

295
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:29,453
Are you working?

296
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:30,921
Just I.M.'ing.

297
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:33,900
If you have to go --

298
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,852
No, I just have to let my assistant
know I'm on the phone with you

299
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:37,283
so I'll be 2 minutes
late to the meeting.

300
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:38,822
I don't want you to be
late for your meeting.

301
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,571
It's no problem. I don't mind.

302
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:43,502
Well, now I feel like I have really to
come up with something great to talk about.

303
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:44,971
No pressure.

304
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,021
- What?
- Nothing.

305
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:49,402
Now you really do have to go.

306
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,282
Well, yeah.

307
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:52,621
"Philanthropic."

308
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:53,511
What?

309
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:56,110
Philanthropic, that was the
word that Benji kept misusing.

310
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:57,382
He kept saying "philantropic."

311
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,833
He thought it meant
"tropical." It was funny.

312
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,113
- I'll call you tonight.
- My tonight or your tonight?

313
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,323
Got to go, Ace.

314
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:04,072
Okay. Bye.

315
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,953
Are you enjoying
your breakfast?

316
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,803
I don't know if
I like pop-tarts.

317
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,533
Did you fall on your head
while you were sleeping?

318
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,922
I don't know. Do I like this?
Is this something I like?

319
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:27,290
So, you fell on your head,
and now you have

320
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:29,593
some kind of very specific amnesia.
Is that it?

321
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:33,242
I mean, last night I was dreading mom
and dad's reaction to the breakup, right?

322
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:35,162
Right. Dread, dread.
I remember.

323
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:37,533
Then they didn't react --
not one bit.

324
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,623
It's almost like the absence
of their reaction was worse

325
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,652
than any freak-out
they could have had.

326
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,721
Okay. Sure.

327
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:44,583
Then  I thought, "why?

328
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,700
Why do I care if they freak out?
I mean, what do I get out of it?"

329
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:49,850
And then I thought,
"maybe their freak-outs

330
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:52,182
are like some kind of compass for me,
you know,

331
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:55,422
like, I know I'm doing what I want
to do if it freaks them out."

332
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:57,833
And then I thought,
"what if I don't want to do

333
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,860
what I want to do
because I want to do it,

334
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:01,942
but because they
don't want me to?"

335
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:02,672
Huh?

336
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:04,880
I mean, what if I don't like
what I like because I like it,

337
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,701
but because my mother
doesn't like it

338
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:08,011
and doesn't want me to like it?

339
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:11,442
What if I don't actually
like the music that I like

340
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,241
or the movies or the
clothes or the men?

341
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:16,570
What if I don't like
what I seem to like?

342
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,070
- Ah, hence the pop-tart.
- Yes. Hence.

343
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:21,243
I can remember the first
time I had a pop-tart.

344
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,043
It was at my friend
Erica Catcha's house,

345
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:24,611
and she said,
"do you want a pop-tart?"

346
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,842
And I knew my
mother would recoil

347
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:28,490
at the very idea of
me having a pop-tart.

348
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:31,180
I could just picture her.
"A pop-tart?!"

349
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:32,761
And so, I had one.

350
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:35,591
And I opened the
little silver wrapper,

351
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,111
and I took a bite,

352
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,022
and I thought nothing
had ever tasted so good.

353
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:43,702
I thought it tasted
like freedom.

354
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:46,152
It tasted like I
was my own person.

355
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,832
The pop-tart tasted
like freedom

356
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,153
and rebellion and independence.

357
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:53,580
Wow. That's some pop-tart.
What flavor was that?

358
00:13:53,595 --> 00:13:56,852
But now I think I don't
know if I like pop-tarts.

359
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,291
What if I don't like pop-tarts?

360
00:13:58,308 --> 00:13:59,560
Would I like pop-tarts

361
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:02,263
if Richard and Emily had served
me pop-tarts on a silver platter

362
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:04,512
and demanded I eat every bite?
I don't know.

363
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:06,132
Hey, where are
all the pop-tarts?

364
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,260
I've been experimenting.

365
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:08,421
You ate all the pop-tarts?

366
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:10,553
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't know if I like them!

367
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,670
Well, I hope you didn't
eat all the froot loops.

368
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,030
Hey, how was last
night's conversation?

369
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:17,220
- Eh.
- Eh-eh?

370
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:19,391
It's just these
transatlantic phone calls.

371
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:21,301
I don't know if it's the
"trans" or the "atlantic"

372
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:23,023
or the fact that it's
2:00 in the morning,

373
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,931
but Helen Keller
and Stephen Hawking

374
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,683
could have a more
connected conversation.

375
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:27,753
Helen Keller's dead.

376
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,321
Yeah, well, even dead,
she could do better.

377
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,662
It's just so awkward and pausy.

378
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:34,283
And I feel like the
more I try to connect,

379
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:35,853
the more disconnected I feel.

380
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,562
And I just feel like
I'm working so hard,

381
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,873
but maybe I shouldn't be
having to work so hard.

382
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:42,341
And then I feel self-conscious,
but I shouldn't feel self-conscious,

383
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:44,510
so then I feel
self-conscious about that.

384
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:46,401
I don't know,
maybe it's just the salt in the ocean.

385
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,352
It corrodes conversations
or something.

386
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,530
Yeah. It sounds like the salt.

387
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,743
- Hey!
- I like pop-tarts.

388
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:02,573
Here you go, ladies.

389
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:04,583
It's the ceilings.
They're vaulted now, aren't they?

390
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:05,763
The ceilings aren't vaulted.

391
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:07,032
I got it, it's the curly fries.

392
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:09,433
You never used to have curly
fries here before, did you, Luke?

393
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:10,942
Always had curly fries.

394
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:13,253
I'm telling you,
something's different about the place.

395
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:16,003
Nothing. Nothing has changed.
It's exactly the same.

396
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,582
He must have done
something to the windows

397
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:19,061
'cause the light is
much better now.

398
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:21,452
Yeah, it's a lot less
gloomy than it used to be.

399
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:23,313
An identical level
of gloom, people.

400
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:25,403
I got it. You got new chairs.

401
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:27,422
I knew my butt felt
more comfortable.

402
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:29,280
Yeah, your butt feels
exactly the same, Babette.

403
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:32,812
Now, would you two can it?
I didn't change a damn thing.

404
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,140
- Hey, Rory.
- Hi, Luke.

405
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:39,600
How's it going?

406
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:42,101
Good. I'm good. And you?

407
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,012
Doing good.

408
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:44,793
Glad to hear that.

409
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,732
Congratulations on
the reopening.

410
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:50,090
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Back to normal, I guess.

411
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:51,600
- New hat?
- Yeah.

412
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,690
So, I didn't think you were
gonna make it back this summer.

413
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:57,923
Oh, I wasn't, but then I did.

414
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:00,180
- Things change.
- Yeah.

415
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:02,953
So, you want a table?

416
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:06,733
No, I think I'll just take some coffee
and a muffin to go, if you have it.

417
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,631
- I have it.
- It's the curtains!

418
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:10,091
Yeah, those curtains
have always been here.

419
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,391
I know. I'm just saying you
used to have more curtains.

420
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,590
No, I never had more curtains.

421
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:17,411
- Hi.
- Lane, hey, come over here.

422
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,891
Hey. So? How did it go?

423
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:24,542
Was it hard? Did he freak out?

424
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:25,711
What are you talking about?

425
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,942
Zach... and the pregnancy.

426
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,960
Oh. That.
I haven't told him yet.

427
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:30,853
Really?

428
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,370
Yeah, I was,
but now I'm thinking I'm gonna wait.

429
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:35,342
Okay. For how long?

430
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:36,883
I don't know. A couple years?

431
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:37,631
Lane!

432
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,692
I'm gonna tell him eventually,
just not yet.

433
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:42,421
Besides, a lot of people
wait a full 12 weeks

434
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,791
before they tell anyone
they're pregnant.

435
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,011
Not the husband.

436
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:48,020
I just need a little more
time to adjust, you know?

437
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:51,270
I kind of want to process this
by myself a little longer.

438
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:53,461
You can wait as
long as you want.

439
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,511
You can wait until the baby
comes out and have her tell him.

440
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,093
- Her?
- Or him.

441
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:59,122
It could be a him?
Oh, god, I'm not ready for a him!

442
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:01,350
- Maybe it'll be a her.
- Who's ready for a her?!

443
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:04,740
You are. And Zach is.
You guys can do this.

444
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,970
Hey, you want to tell him?

445
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:08,190
One coffee. One muffin.

446
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:10,313
One employee
sitting at a table.

447
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:11,401
Sorry, Luke.

448
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,521
- Thanks, Luke. See you later.
- See you later.

449
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:16,212
- New mugs!
- Hey! Same mugs.

450
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:21,562
Wow. Somebody's
all fancy-pants.

451
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:23,441
I've never seen your
hair up like that.

452
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,433
I'm just trying out a new look,
seeing if I like it,

453
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:27,201
serving no master but myself.

454
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:29,913
Are you gonna try pigtails, too?
Because that's kind of my thing.

455
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,130
It's freeing, really.

456
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:34,561
I never realized how my mother
influenced my every decision,

457
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:36,381
even decisions that don't
seem like decisions,

458
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,561
like tying my shoes.

459
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:40,071
I mean, I've always been a fan
of the bunny ears, you know?

460
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:42,832
And this morning I
decided not to bunny-ear,

461
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:43,751
and you know what happened?

462
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:44,380
No.

463
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,510
Turns out bunny ears take a lot
longer than the regular way.

464
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,220
I saved like three
seconds this morning.

465
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,033
What does your mother have
to do with bunny ears?

466
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:52,631
My mother is everywhere --

467
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:54,683
in my shoes,
in my clothes, in my food.

468
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,140
- Your mother is here.
- In my Inn.

469
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,251
What do you mean? What are you
talking about? Why is my mother here?

470
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,963
She's here to taste
the menu for the tea.

471
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:02,653
Why doesn't she know
what I'm talking about?

472
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:03,542
What tea?

473
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,142
I thought you were
going to tell her.

474
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:05,890
What tea?

475
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:07,352
I was going to tell her.

476
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:10,181
Then I considered what it would
be like if I did not tell her,

477
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:12,163
and I thought it
might be more fun.

478
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,881
- I was right.
- What tea?

479
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,943
Lorelai, do you normally keep
your guests waiting like that?

480
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:17,792
It's very rude. Hello, Sookie.

481
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,763
Hi, Mrs. Gilmore. Welcome.

482
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:21,220
What tea?

483
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:22,822
There's no need to
shout, Lorelai.

484
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,991
I'm bringing the girls here
friday for afternoon tea

485
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,470
as part of their
etiquette training.

486
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:27,961
Here? Why are you
bringing them here?

487
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,502
Actually, I was going to
take them into the city

488
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,061
for high tea at the Pierre.

489
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,493
But the ma�tre d' at the
Pierre apparently believes

490
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:37,150
that proper high tea includes
club sandwiches and a juice bar,

491
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:40,071
and I simply couldn't subject
these impressionable young girls

492
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,773
to such tasteless effrontery.

493
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,423
Do they even have
tea at a cotillion?

494
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:44,692
Don't be absurd.

495
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,653
As long as I have them under my wing,
I feel that it is my duty

496
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,800
to offer them as much of
my expertise as possible.

497
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:53,202
Last week we went
to the symphony

498
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,380
and the hopper
exhibit at the Met.

499
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:58,530
This week it's high tea and
"Rigoletto" at Lincoln Center.

500
00:18:58,546 --> 00:18:59,792
Have you done that thing
where they walk around

501
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:02,041
with books on their heads?
That's always a good one.

502
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,773
Sookie, these are
simply divine.

503
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,430
It's the lemon zest.
It makes all the difference.

504
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:09,333
Although, we definitely shouldn't
serve the spinach quiche.

505
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,712
Some of the girls have braces,
and their mothers would never forgive me

506
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:14,502
if they spent the evening
with hideous green smiles.

507
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:18,220
Perhaps shrimp salad or a more
traditional cream cheese and cucumber

508
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:19,272
would be more appropriate?

509
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:21,023
Yum. Cucumber.

510
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:23,380
Is that peanut
butter and jelly?

511
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,682
Yes. I just thought since
the girls were only 10

512
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:28,492
that they'd enjoy it more than
the smoked-salmon sandwiches.

513
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,272
They're 10.
They're not animals.

514
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:33,843
This is a proper tea, Sookie.
I'm not interested in circus food.

515
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:35,372
Stings, don't it?

516
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:37,963
I'd like to see the room we'll be using.
If the lighting isn't right,

517
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,571
we may have to make
some adjustments.

518
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,390
Right this way.

519
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:44,613
I like your hair
like that, Lorelai.

520
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:51,920
It's a good sentence,
but you want to make sure

521
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,522
never to end with
a preposition.

522
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:54,862
If she ended the sentence
with a preposition,

523
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,521
how could it have
been a good sentence?

524
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:57,873
Sounds like a
terrible sentence.

525
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,110
- Oh, I just--
- You were just coddling her,

526
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:00,891
that's what you were just doing.
You want to prop her up on your knee

527
00:20:00,928 --> 00:20:02,720
and burp her, too,
maybe buy her a pony?

528
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,441
I'm not paying you to make her feel
better about her incompetence.

529
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,090
If she can't construct
a proper sentence,

530
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:09,430
how is she gonna pass the
essay section of the S.A.T.?

531
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:10,503
- Well --
- That was rhetorical!

532
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:12,060
Carry on.

533
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:15,881
Why don't you go
slower, Dalton?

534
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:18,971
'Cause you haven't been on the same page
for the last 20 minutes or anything.

535
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:22,052
Okay, "doctor is
to hospital as,

536
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,830
"'A,' sports fan is to stadium,

537
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,283
'B,' ice is to freezer,

538
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:26,861
'C' professor is to college,

539
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,711
or, 'D,' criminal is to jail?"

540
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,290
Um, "A," sports
fan is to stadium?

541
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:34,081
It's actually "C,"
professor is to college.

542
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:35,383
When you're doing
this kind of analogy,

543
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:37,020
you have to be a
little more specific

544
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,241
than just filling in the
blank with "is found in."

545
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,783
A doctor works in a hospital,

546
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:43,150
just as a professor
works in a college.

547
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:44,223
Make sense?

548
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:45,212
You're really smart.

549
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:46,582
Thanks. That's
very sweet, Eric.

550
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,050
And you're just as smart.
I promise.

551
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:49,402
Are you kidding me with this?

552
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,483
That's it! Pencils down.
That means you, Casanova.

553
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:53,312
Time is up! Everyone out.

554
00:20:53,326 --> 00:20:55,190
Unless your parents want to
start paying for overtime,

555
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:57,361
which for many of you
might be a good idea.

556
00:20:57,378 --> 00:20:59,542
Not so fast, employees.

557
00:20:59,556 --> 00:21:01,552
Today's work was
shoddy at best.

558
00:21:01,568 --> 00:21:03,901
Between the overt coddling and
the inappropriate flirting,

559
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,660
I feel like I'm
running a bordello.

560
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:08,440
Gilmore, do you see any of my
students falling in love with me?

561
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:10,423
No. And you know why?
Because you don't fall in love

562
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,450
with people that make you
want to crap your pants.

563
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,152
I want to see terror
in their eyes!

564
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:17,262
Fear is a great motivator, people.
Use it.

565
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,182
What are you standing
around here for? Go!

566
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,722
Dismissed.

567
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:24,102
Okay, I'm not your
boss anymore.

568
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,502
We can do five minutes
of friend time.

569
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:27,953
I appreciate the offer,
but I have to make a phone call, so...

570
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,243
- Logan?
- Yep.

571
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:30,190
How's that going?

572
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,293
It's good, you know? It's fine.

573
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:33,883
- So, it's awful?
- No.

574
00:21:33,897 --> 00:21:36,523
Because you downgraded from good
to fine in under two seconds,

575
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:37,732
so I figured I'd
cut to the chase.

576
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:40,860
Not awful.
It's just hard because of the distance.

577
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:42,710
Uh-huh. How's the sex?

578
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:45,710
Um, well,
seeing as he's in London and I'm here,

579
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:47,670
the sex is pretty
much nonexistent.

580
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,892
You've got a phone. Use it.

581
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,890
What? You mean...

582
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:53,541
I can't do that.

583
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:54,932
I talk to my mother
on that phone.

584
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:56,373
Okay, what about texting?

585
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:57,832
No. No, thank you.

586
00:21:57,846 --> 00:21:59,722
Why not? You say stuff when
you're together, don't you?

587
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:01,051
Yeah. I guess. Sometimes.

588
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:03,240
So, text it. Texting is great.

589
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:05,000
And you can do it while
you're doing other things.

590
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:06,443
Doyle and I are
doing it right now.

591
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,810
What?

592
00:22:08,716 --> 00:22:09,960
Oh, my god!

593
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:11,551
Don't worry. This is advanced.

594
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,831
Right now, all you're looking
to do is create some intimacy.

595
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:14,850
Stick to the basics.

596
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,200
I don't have any basics.

597
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:17,100
Write what you know.

598
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:18,773
Thanks, Paris.
I'll figure something out.

599
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:20,143
Doyle thinks it's a great idea.

600
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:21,642
Okay, can you not talk
about me on that thing

601
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:23,282
when you're doing
that with him?

602
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:24,202
Sorry.

603
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:25,632
Jeez.

604
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,960
I'm telling you, man,
she's totally avoiding me.

605
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,920
She won't even talk to me.
She'll barely look at me.

606
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,673
It's over. She's divorcing me.

607
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,352
I'll admit it,
it's not the best marriage I've seen,

608
00:22:37,388 --> 00:22:38,893
although I only have my
parents to compare it to,

609
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,113
and they're unusually happy.

610
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,852
We were happy once,
and then that stupid honeymoon happened.

611
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:45,283
And ever since we came home,
it's like she's a different person.

612
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:47,143
- Maybe it was the parasite.
- What do you mean?

613
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:49,012
You know, maybe the parasite
like got into her brain

614
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:50,573
and ate away the part that
was in love with you.

615
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:52,193
I just can't believe it's over.

616
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,131
I mean, we haven't even written
our thank-you notes yet.

617
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,083
I was gonna say.

618
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:56,901
Hey man,
I already told you we like the bowl.

619
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,911
Doesn't mean I don't
deserve a note.

620
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,203
It's all gonna be okay, Zach.

621
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:05,153
I'm here for you, man.
I got your back.

622
00:23:06,328 --> 00:23:07,543
Hey, that's nice.

623
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:10,081
Yeah, the pain is
totally helping my music.

624
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:13,260
We need to talk.

625
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:14,553
Okay.

626
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,280
Let's talk.

627
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:17,912
Alone?

628
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:21,921
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Brian.

629
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:24,161
I'm pregnant.

630
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:31,111
With a baby?

631
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,400
Yes, pregnant with a baby.

632
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,133
But how? When?

633
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:37,741
On a beach in Mexico,
about three weeks ago.

634
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:38,933
I'm pretty sure you were there.

635
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:40,613
But we only did it once.

636
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:42,881
Once is really all it takes.

637
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:49,823
- Where are you going?
- Brian must be freaking out!

638
00:23:50,987 --> 00:23:52,683
Good afternoon, Lorelai.

639
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,311
Oh, my goodness.

640
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:57,032
Is the library ready for us?

641
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:59,022
Yes, the tables are set,
and the tea is brewed,

642
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:00,461
and I've hired some
extra poor people

643
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:02,772
for the girls to look down on.

644
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:05,881
She's the one I told you about --
a regular Imogene Coca.

645
00:24:05,897 --> 00:24:08,403
Oh, my god, I love them.

646
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:12,003
They are like madame
Alexander dolls come to life.

647
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:16,780
All right, ladies, chins up,
tummies in, and glide.

648
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:25,480
Now, remember, ladies,
the dress you'll be wearing

649
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:29,023
at the cotillion on saturday
will have much fuller skirts.

650
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:31,332
Several of you may be
working with a crinoline,

651
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,832
so sitting will be an entirely
different experience.

652
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,310
What is the rule of thumb
we can always apply?

653
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:37,041
Tiffany?

654
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,383
Bottoms out.

655
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:39,802
That's right.

656
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:42,371
Bottoms, sit.

657
00:24:42,385 --> 00:24:43,210
Very good.

658
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:45,830
Such elegance,
such a sense of decorum,

659
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:47,730
manners, grace, charm --

660
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:50,582
everything my childhood
could have been but wasn't.

661
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:52,903
Oh, to go back and do it right.

662
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,090
Hey, that's cool!

663
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:56,912
Caroline, we do not grab or
grope our dinner partners.

664
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,872
Sorry, Mrs. Gilmore.

665
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:02,363
Always maintain proper
spacing and distance.

666
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:04,802
It's all coming back to me.
Proper spacing and distance.

667
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:06,112
Other kids were
hugged and kissed.

668
00:25:06,146 --> 00:25:08,642
I was taught to maintain
proper spacing and distance.

669
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:11,790
...in which case,
the utensil rule still applies.

670
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:15,760
No utensil, once used,
may ever touch the table again.

671
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:18,632
Imagine leaving a ring
of raspberry preserves

672
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,482
on a set of fine linens.

673
00:25:20,495 --> 00:25:22,201
Granted, these linens
aren't the best.

674
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:26,212
But at the cotillion on saturday,
everything will be of the highest quality.

675
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:30,292
All right, ladies,
choose your first sandwich.

676
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:32,853
- Take me.
- Oh, Michel!

677
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,232
Take me to the cotillion.
I have to be there.

678
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:36,551
I want to go back
and do it right.

679
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:38,182
- No, forget it.
- I insist.

680
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:39,772
You must take me.
You have no choice.

681
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,582
I have no choice?
Do you know me?

682
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:43,170
I'm not going to my
mother's cotillion.

683
00:25:43,185 --> 00:25:44,470
You owe me.

684
00:25:44,485 --> 00:25:47,081
- What? I do not.
- Oh, yes, you do.

685
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:49,092
Last november,
when you were going out of town

686
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:51,990
and nervous about boarding
Paul Anka for the first time,

687
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:54,413
you forced me,
against my better judgment,

688
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,630
to have Paul Anka over
to my home for the day

689
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,612
so he could acclimate
to other dogs.

690
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:01,471
Well, not only did he
traumatize my poor chows,

691
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:04,251
but somehow he managed
to get into my closet,

692
00:26:04,268 --> 00:26:06,680
the door of which
was firmly closed...

693
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,072
I know.
I don't know how he does that.

694
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:11,191
...and proceeded to poop
in my Prada loafers.

695
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:12,581
Well, he knows good quality.

696
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:14,402
When I returned
your foul creature

697
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,973
and told you about
what happened,

698
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:19,272
you apologized profusely
and then wrote an I.O.U.

699
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:23,191
on several little post-its,
thinking it was all so clever.

700
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,323
Gosh, I don't remember that.

701
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:27,633
I thought as much.

702
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:31,491
...on the seat of your chair. Do not
leave it carelessly strewn about the table.

703
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:33,150
Caroline?

704
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,852
Caroline!

705
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,731
"I"..."O"..."U"...

706
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:46,193
"one"..."big"..."favor."

707
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:48,161
Can't prove I wrote that.

708
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:49,931
"Lorelai Gilmore."

709
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:51,472
- Ohh! I'll buy you a car.
- No.

710
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:53,032
- A house.
- Pick me up at 7:00.

711
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:53,642
Michel!

712
00:26:53,656 --> 00:26:56,303
And wear your hair like
you had it the other day.

713
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,420
Good nap, babe?

714
00:26:59,436 --> 00:27:01,041
Yeah, I was really out of it.

715
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:03,043
I'm so tired all the time.
It's weird.

716
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:04,602
Huh. Must be the heat.

717
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:07,161
Yeah, right, I guess that could
have something to do with it.

718
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:08,021
Beer?

719
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:10,622
No, I don't think I'll be
drinking beer for a while.

720
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:13,603
Oh, that's cool.
Going a little straightedge.

721
00:27:13,617 --> 00:27:16,330
But we probably should be
drinking more calcium,

722
00:27:16,347 --> 00:27:19,340
so maybe I should keep an extra
gallon of milk around the house.

723
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:20,413
No problemo.

724
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,391
And I may start having
cravings soon --

725
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,602
Oh man!
You know what I'm craving right now?

726
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:27,051
Pizza bagels. Those are definitely
going on the grocery list.

727
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:28,622
- Want some of those?
- Sure.

728
00:27:28,636 --> 00:27:32,200
Do you like that, mountain ninja?
Do you like the taste of my broadsword?

729
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:33,983
Well, I'm off to see Rory.

730
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:35,803
Have fun.

731
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:47,483
Yikes. Oh, no.

732
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:49,013
- Whoa!
- That's disgusting.

733
00:27:49,027 --> 00:27:51,053
- Wow.
- No way! No way!

734
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:52,570
I can't write this
stuff to Logan.

735
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,553
I can barely read it to myself.
I'm bright red.

736
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:56,280
Did you notice no one
ever gives details

737
00:27:56,296 --> 00:27:57,761
when they tell you
about childbirth?

738
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:01,802
It's because the details are
gross and scary and unacceptable.

739
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:02,750
Like what?

740
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,611
Well, apparently,
in about three months,

741
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,473
I can look forward to
dark spots on my face

742
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,243
because it's not enough
to just get fat.

743
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,133
It's not fat. It's a baby.

744
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:12,950
A baby that will
shoot out of my body

745
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:15,423
despite the fact that it's
obviously much too large.

746
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:16,840
I didn't think this through
when we were dating.

747
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,063
I was all into the fact that
Zach was big and manly,

748
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,922
which means I'm gonna have a big,
manly baby,

749
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:21,873
and I'm a small woman.

750
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:23,713
I never thought of
Zach as big and manly.

751
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:25,000
Compared to Henry Lee?

752
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:26,681
Remember when my mom wanted
me to date Henry Lee?

753
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:27,791
He was like yea high.

754
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:29,833
I would have had tiny,
little, yea-high babies.

755
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,041
Yeah, but he was
your second cousin.

756
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,273
I think you would have had other
problems with those babies.

757
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:34,741
Whatever. I'm not doing it.

758
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:36,770
This baby is just gonna have
to find another way out

759
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:38,752
or stay in there forever.
I really don't care.

760
00:28:38,765 --> 00:28:41,652
Don't worry about that part. Just keep
taking things one step at a time.

761
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,801
- You're doing great.
- How? How am I doing great?

762
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:46,073
You told Zach.
That was a very significant step.

763
00:28:46,088 --> 00:28:48,482
Yeah, I told him,
but I'm pretty sure he forgot.

764
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:49,641
What do you mean he forgot?

765
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:52,871
I don't know how things get lost
in the recesses of Zach's brain,

766
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:53,831
but I think he forgot.

767
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:56,321
Well, maybe he's just taking
time to process all of this.

768
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:57,380
You needed some time.

769
00:28:57,396 --> 00:28:59,932
I am growing a human
being inside my body.

770
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,392
I deserve time. Ugh!

771
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:05,001
Okay, what about this?

772
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:06,492
"Where is the chair you sit in?

773
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:09,023
Where is your favorite comb,
your toothbrush, your nail file?

774
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,680
Trot them out,
that I may devour them at one gulp."

775
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:12,850
You want to eat his toothbrush?

776
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:15,831
No, I'm trying to convey
that I miss him very much.

777
00:29:15,846 --> 00:29:17,661
Sounds like you miss
his toiletry kit.

778
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:20,511
It's supposed to be
metaphorical and evocative.

779
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,491
It's Henry Miller.

780
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:23,042
Henry Miller has better
stuff than that.

781
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:25,943
Believe me,
that is not why they banned his books.

782
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:27,341
Well, I'm not gonna write,

783
00:29:27,357 --> 00:29:30,591
"Our hands groped frantically
for the burning flesh."

784
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:31,592
Oh, that's better.

785
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:34,002
That's way hotter than
the eating-his-comb thing.

786
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:34,612
Oh really?

787
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:36,870
Why not? Go for it. Why are you making 
such a big deal out of this?

788
00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:38,333
I'm just worried, you know?

789
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:40,822
I mean, we talk to each
other on the phone every day,

790
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:44,133
but I just don't think that that's
enough to keep this relationship going.

791
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:46,582
I guess I never realized how
important the other stuff was.

792
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:47,642
The sex stuff?

793
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:48,840
And the holding-hands

794
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:51,100
and the falling-asleep-
next-to-each-other stuff.

795
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:54,483
I mean, that's where the crazy intimacy
comes from, and without those options,

796
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:57,963
when they're just taken away from
you 'cause someone moves to London...

797
00:29:58,258 --> 00:30:00,220
Desperate measures.

798
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:03,051
Burn that flesh, sister.

799
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:06,600
Okay.

800
00:30:06,615 --> 00:30:08,382
Here it goes.

801
00:30:10,838 --> 00:30:12,111
I think I'm gonna puke.

802
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:14,540
Join me. That's all I'll be
doing for the next two months.

803
00:30:14,557 --> 00:30:16,280
Oh, and did I mention
the extra hair

804
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:19,670
that may start to grow on my chin?
Can't wait for that magic.

805
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,512
Ooh, wow, quick response.
I think you did good.

806
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:23,400
It's not him.

807
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:24,320
Hi, dad.

808
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:25,930
Hey, kiddo. What are you up to?

809
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:28,752
Um, just reading. Reading the books.
What are you doing?

810
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:30,021
Just drinking the coffee,

811
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:31,250
thinking I haven't
seen you in a while.

812
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,633
I know. I miss you.

813
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:35,440
Me too. So, maybe we could have
dinner tomorrow night if you're free.

814
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:36,970
- Tomorrow night?
- Only if you're free.

815
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:38,831
I'm free.
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

816
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:39,791
- Yeah?
- Sure.

817
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:42,121
Great. That's great.
I'll pick you up about 7:00.

818
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:43,080
Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.

819
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:44,352
Bye, Rory.

820
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:46,511
Maybe I'll look
good with a beard.

821
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,362
Whoa! Can I keep this?

822
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:53,730
First, help me find
something to wear tonight.

823
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:55,233
Then you can steal whatever you want,
except that --

824
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:56,452
I'm getting buried in that.

825
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:58,820
I just don't understand why
you're going to this cotillion.

826
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:01,683
Does Michel have compromising photographs 
of you, that I don't know about,

827
00:31:01,716 --> 00:31:03,602
like some snapshots
from your perm year?

828
00:31:03,616 --> 00:31:06,220
No, but he does have post-its.

829
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,382
Word to the wise. Don't
ever put anything in writing,

830
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,461
'cause even when it's on florescent
sticky paper, it's still binding.

831
00:31:11,477 --> 00:31:15,323
You are so wise and
awesome and generous.

832
00:31:15,337 --> 00:31:16,971
Yeah, you can steal
anything you want

833
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:18,390
if you go to the
cotillion for me.

834
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:20,412
- Can't.
- Why? You don't have any work.

835
00:31:20,428 --> 00:31:22,020
You don't have a
boyfriend to play with.

836
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:24,001
You barely have anyone
to hang out with at all.

837
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,232
Keep going. You're really making
me want to do you a favor here.

838
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:29,273
I can't tonight because
I have plans with dad.

839
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:30,451
Your dad?

840
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:32,962
I'm not in the habit of calling
other people's dads "dad."

841
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:34,513
Yeah, my dad.

842
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:37,251
He called and asked me if I
wanted to have dinner with him.

843
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:38,193
Is that a problem?

844
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,972
No, of course not.
I just didn't realize you were talking.

845
00:31:40,985 --> 00:31:42,430
I haven't talked to him at all,

846
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:43,670
which is why I was
happy he called,

847
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:45,660
because we were talking
all the time before.

848
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:46,712
Yeah, I know.

849
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:48,130
I mean,
just because you guys aren't talking,

850
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:50,020
it doesn't mean I'm not
allowed to talk to him, right?

851
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,193
We are not not talking.

852
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:54,510
We're just not
talking right now.

853
00:31:54,528 --> 00:31:55,250
Okay.

854
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:57,732
Listen, I think it's great that
you're having dinner with your dad.

855
00:31:57,768 --> 00:31:59,322
- Good.
- Good.

856
00:31:59,337 --> 00:32:00,502
What is with that thing?

857
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:02,233
I sent Logan a text
message yesterday,

858
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:03,972
and he still hasn't
written me back.

859
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,460
Plus, we missed our
last two phone calls

860
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:07,931
'cause he keeps getting dragged
into this boring meetings.

861
00:32:07,948 --> 00:32:09,400
If he hasn't sent you anything back,
it's probably

862
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:11,043
'cause he just
hasn't had time yet.

863
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,490
Yeah, that's probably it.

864
00:32:12,505 --> 00:32:14,571
Can I wear this
to the cotillion?

865
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:16,822
Mnh-mnh.

866
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,992
Something wrong with
your dinner, babe?

867
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,130
If your bagel's
a little frozen,

868
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:25,700
I can microwave that
bad boy for you.

869
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:28,402
It's not that.
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

870
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:31,460
Yeah, I've been
feeling queasy, too.

871
00:32:31,478 --> 00:32:33,272
I'm telling you,
it's got to be the heat.

872
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:34,472
Do you want to go to
a movie or something?

873
00:32:34,508 --> 00:32:36,192
Cool down with some free A.C.?

874
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:38,671
I have a better idea.
Why don't we talk?

875
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:41,583
Sure. What do you
want to talk about?

876
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:43,163
The baby.

877
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:48,503
I'm cool with the
whole baby thing.

878
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:49,763
- You are?
- Yeah.

879
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:51,301
So, you're not worried at all?

880
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,080
Nope, no worries on this end.

881
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:54,051
I see.

882
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:56,340
I think Brian might be
freaking out a little bit,

883
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:58,023
but that's his problem.

884
00:32:58,037 --> 00:33:01,253
Really? I didn't know
Brian was concerned.

885
00:33:01,265 --> 00:33:02,421
Well, sure.

886
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:05,163
I mean, he was just getting used
to the idea of us getting married,

887
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:07,681
and I don't think he was
expecting a baby yet.

888
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:10,582
But it's a lot for
the guy to take in.

889
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:13,152
Absolutely. You know,
maybe I should talk to Brian about this

890
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,963
because it sounds like he
and I are on the same page.

891
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:16,942
What do you mean?

892
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:18,740
Well, I'm glad you're fine
with the whole baby thing,

893
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:20,511
but I'm kind of freaking out.

894
00:33:20,528 --> 00:33:21,471
You are?

895
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:24,250
Totally. Zach, this is not how
I expected our life to go --

896
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:28,442
be married for like a day and then suddenly 
having to take on this new responsibility.

897
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:31,133
Bringing a child into this world,
it's so...

898
00:33:31,145 --> 00:33:33,743
- It's major, right?
- It's very major.

899
00:33:33,756 --> 00:33:36,090
So, you're not all psyched
about being knocked up?

900
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:37,950
Are you kidding?
This baby sucks!

901
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah! This baby totally sucks!

902
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,540
- It does.
- It so does.

903
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:43,881
- Do you know what afterbirth is?
- No.

904
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:46,893
- Dude.
- I know.

905
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:49,401
You know how the baby is
connected to you by that hose

906
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:50,812
and I'm supposed
to cut that hose?

907
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:52,173
No way I'm cutting that hose.

908
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:53,860
No way I'm letting
you in the room

909
00:33:53,877 --> 00:33:54,843
when that thing
comes out of me.

910
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,940
Oh, man, you are so awesome.
I love you so much.

911
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:58,940
I love you, too.

912
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,350
It's like you don't even care.

913
00:34:02,365 --> 00:34:03,990
I care about you,
just not this.

914
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,663
After all the trouble I went through
picking out the perfect flower for you.

915
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:08,671
It's kind of big, don't you think?
It's like wearing a tree on my arm.

916
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:10,461
- It is an orchid.
- It's scratchy.

917
00:34:10,476 --> 00:34:12,720
Could have got me something,
a simple boutonniere. But no.

918
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:14,530
- I'm so humiliated.
- Hey, I have an idea.

919
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:16,650
Why don't we go back to the flower
store, and I'll get you something?

920
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:17,583
It'll take 2 seconds.

921
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:20,213
Forget it.
We're late enough as it is.

922
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:23,752
Yes, I can die now.

923
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:24,851
Me too.

924
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:26,460
Look at that girl. Poor thing.

925
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:29,401
Oh, why did someone force her
to wear those exercise shoes?

926
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:32,183
She'd probably rather be home,
in jeans, climbing a tree.

927
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,323
She looks perfectly
happy to me.

928
00:34:34,335 --> 00:34:36,772
You know what I see when
I look at this room?

929
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:39,071
A bunch of kids whose outfits
cost more than my car?

930
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:43,100
No, these are not kids.
They are perfect, tiny adults.

931
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:46,512
We are standing amongst the next
generation of movers and shakers.

932
00:34:46,528 --> 00:34:48,583
The future president
of the united states

933
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,682
may be in this room
with us tonight.

934
00:34:50,698 --> 00:34:52,352
You're very odd.

935
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:54,570
- Lorelai, you're here.
- I am.

936
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:56,143
Hello, Emily.

937
00:34:56,158 --> 00:35:00,080
Oh, Emily, may I just say that
what you have created here tonight

938
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,842
is nothing short of perfection?

939
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:06,892
This --
this is a kind of nirvana on earth.

940
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:10,141
Thank you, Michel.
It's very kind of you to say.

941
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:13,121
I'm sorry. What on earth
are those musicians playing?

942
00:35:13,138 --> 00:35:14,403
It sounds lovely.

943
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:16,980
Are those violinists on speed?

944
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,212
Excuse me.

945
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:19,512
Hey, I'm gonna get some punch.
You want some?

946
00:35:19,546 --> 00:35:22,711
Oh, no, thank you very much.
I'm much too excited for punch.

947
00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:25,143
My throat closes off
when I'm excited,

948
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:28,092
so swallowing punch would be
very difficult right now.

949
00:35:28,108 --> 00:35:29,362
Okay.

950
00:35:30,677 --> 00:35:33,503
- Lorelai.
- Charlotte, hi.

951
00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:35,730
I'm having the most
wonderful time.

952
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:37,721
Grandmother, grandfather,
it's my pleasure

953
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,580
to introduce you to
Lorelai Gilmore.

954
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,283
Lorelai, these are
my grandparents --

955
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:42,810
Beverly and Arthur Courtwright.

956
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:45,003
Ah, the famous Lorelai.

957
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,641
Famous? I have to catch
up on my us weeklies.

958
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,461
Charlotte told us
you were a card.

959
00:35:49,478 --> 00:35:52,451
She also told us that you were
a delightful dining companion,

960
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:55,503
like Noel Coward and Slim
Keith rolled into one.

961
00:35:55,515 --> 00:35:57,271
Oh, well,
she's delightful, too,

962
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,061
like Shirley Temple
and mother Teresa

963
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:02,641
and someone with very good
table manners rolled into one.

964
00:36:02,657 --> 00:36:04,953
It's starting.
The dancing is starting.

965
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:06,402
We should get the camera.

966
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,500
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah.

967
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:10,081
Lorelai, did I tell you?

968
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:12,863
Margot, Caroline,
and I are doing a hip-hop dance,

969
00:36:12,876 --> 00:36:14,570
and it's gonna be so funny.

970
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:16,210
We rehearsed it
in the bathroom.

971
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:19,980
The whole thing ends up with us
somersaulting towards the band.

972
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:21,810
Wow! That's really great.

973
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:22,982
Are you gonna come dance?

974
00:36:22,998 --> 00:36:25,362
Oh, no. It's just for the kids.

975
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:27,370
Oh, come on.
Everybody is dancing.

976
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:29,941
Pardon me.
Would you like to dance, Charlotte?

977
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:32,032
I would be delighted, Toby.

978
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:46,870
People seem to be
enjoying themselves.

979
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:48,451
Yeah. They really do,
don't they?

980
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:49,952
Want to dance?

981
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:51,320
Me? No. Are you serious?

982
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,941
I never joke about dancing.

983
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:54,660
- No, I'll pass.
- You cannot pass.

984
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:57,113
This is still my night,
and I'd like to dance with you.

985
00:36:57,126 --> 00:37:00,963
Besides, Charlotte insisted that
I get you out on the dance floor,

986
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:03,500
so that it's two against one --
you lose.

987
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,942
- Now, let's go.
- Oh!

988
00:37:06,286 --> 00:37:07,540
Well...

989
00:37:20,327 --> 00:37:22,161
I see you're having
a terrible time.

990
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:23,561
The worst.

991
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:27,760
So, do you want the rest of this key
lime pie or should I take it with me?

992
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:29,192
I don't know how you
ordered key lime pie

993
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:30,821
when there was chocolate
brownie on the menu.

994
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:32,390
Because you'd already
ordered a chocolate brownie.

995
00:37:32,426 --> 00:37:34,022
But just the one.

996
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:35,540
Maybe we should give
it to Paul Anka.

997
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:38,211
After all, the doggie bag was
invented with him in mind.

998
00:37:38,227 --> 00:37:39,821
Seems only fair he
should benefit.

999
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:42,013
Ther's no way he's
gonna eat that.

1000
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:44,920
- I told you.
- Hey.

1001
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:46,091
Hi, mom.

1002
00:37:46,106 --> 00:37:47,812
Hey, we were just
splitting up the food.

1003
00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:49,531
I'm... on my way out.

1004
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:51,593
Oh. Take your time.

1005
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:54,563
Is that key lime
pie on the floor?

1006
00:37:54,577 --> 00:37:55,991
Is that a corsage on your arm?

1007
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,973
Oh, this? Yeah.
Subtle, isn't it?

1008
00:37:57,987 --> 00:38:01,460
If by "subtle," you mean "weird and
giant," then, yeah, super subtle.

1009
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:05,101
Okay, I think I'm gonna take
Paul Anka for his walk.

1010
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,240
Thanks for dinner, dad.

1011
00:38:06,256 --> 00:38:07,862
Yeah, thanks, kiddo.

1012
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:09,312
Come on.

1013
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,820
Go on.

1014
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:14,650
Oh, thanks.

1015
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:17,882
Did you guys have fun?

1016
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,290
It was good, really good.

1017
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:21,352
First time I ever saw
her order a drink.

1018
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,520
Strange, right?

1019
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:24,110
Very strange.

1020
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:27,622
Anyway, I should be going.

1021
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:29,051
I'm sorry I didn't
call you back.

1022
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:31,580
- It's okay.
- I was going to. I just...

1023
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:33,832
I understand.
Don't worry about it.

1024
00:38:35,117 --> 00:38:37,341
Do you want some
coffee or anything?

1025
00:38:37,355 --> 00:38:39,092
- Sure.
- Okay.

1026
00:38:46,716 --> 00:38:49,211
Actually, you know what?
I can't.

1027
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,372
Oh. Okay.

1028
00:38:52,516 --> 00:38:55,152
I can't just sit here
and have coffee with you.

1029
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,483
Okay.

1030
00:38:56,497 --> 00:38:58,230
I love you.

1031
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:01,531
I know the other night didn't
mean for you what it did for me,

1032
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,543
but I don't regret it and I haven't stopped 
thinking about it since it happened --

1033
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:07,312
not just because it was great,

1034
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:09,212
which it was...

1035
00:39:09,745 --> 00:39:12,272
but because it was right.
It was so right, Lore,

1036
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:14,202
and you may not see that right now,
but I do.

1037
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,100
And if I have to wait until
we're both 80 years old

1038
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:19,602
for you to see it,
then I'll wait.

1039
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:22,073
I'm not going anywhere.
This is it for me.

1040
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:24,491
You're it for me.

1041
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:27,091
And I can't pretend to
feel any less than I do.

1042
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:29,202
I'm sorry. I-I --

1043
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,793
I just can't.

1044
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:57,013
Ace.

1045
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:58,940
Hey, how's it going?

1046
00:39:59,908 --> 00:40:02,751
It's 4:45 in the morning.
Are you okay? Did something happen?

1047
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:06,361
Not really. Um, I just --

1048
00:40:06,378 --> 00:40:08,791
I sent you a text
the other day.

1049
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,970
Yeah, I know.
I texted you back.

1050
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:12,922
No, you didn't.

1051
00:40:12,936 --> 00:40:14,502
Yes, I did. Check your phone.

1052
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:16,102
I don't have any missed calls.

1053
00:40:16,115 --> 00:40:19,233
Oh, wait, there's a little envelope
thingy in the bottom corner.

1054
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:20,331
Get out of town.

1055
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:22,961
It went directly to my saved messages.
Why would it do that?

1056
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:25,933
- I couldn't tell you.
- Ooh, wow.

1057
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:28,442
Whoa, yours is really good.

1058
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:30,822
Okay, well, sorry to wake you.

1059
00:40:30,836 --> 00:40:32,350
I'll talk to you
in a few hours.

1060
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,173
Whoa, wait a minute.
Where do you think you're going?

1061
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:35,512
Um, to sleep?

1062
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:37,691
No, I don't think so.
You woke me up.

1063
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:38,962
I'm up. Text me back.

1064
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:40,670
You want me to
text you back now?

1065
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:42,013
You started this.

1066
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:45,060
I know,
but I don't have my books with me.

1067
00:40:45,078 --> 00:40:46,602
You don't need your books, Ace.

1068
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:49,120
- Logan --
- I miss you, Rory.

1069
00:40:49,135 --> 00:40:50,962
- You do?
- Yeah.

1070
00:40:50,978 --> 00:40:52,650
I miss you, too.

1071
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,820
I can't text you with
you on the phone.

1072
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:56,060
Okay, so hang up.

1073
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,220
- I'm gonna hang up now.
- Okay.

1074
00:40:58,447 --> 00:41:01,542
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

1075
00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:38,541
Hi, Chris.
