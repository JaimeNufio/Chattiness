1
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:33,062
You don't? Well, when are you going to get it in?

2
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:35,327
Fine.

3
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:39,362
Two boxes of annular thread silicon pronged boat pads.

4
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,479
A band saw.

5
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:43,356
A wood rack, and a jack plane.

6
00:00:43,438 --> 00:00:45,092
Yeah, I'll hold.

7
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:48,235
Eh? Apparently now we've been married for forty years?

8
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,922
Sorry. This stupid boat supply place does everything but actually supply anything.

9
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:53,447
Oh, catalogues. I love catalogues.

10
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:55,824
It's boating parts. Yes, yes, I'm here!

11
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,000
None of them. Man, you must have a lot of room in that place of yours.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,080
Yeah, sure. Backorder it. What the hell.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,650
Oh! Look at these boots!

14
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:07,527
Let's try twenty C-clamps, five inches or larger.

15
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:10,744
A box of quarter inch teak buns, marine caulk.

16
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:11,761
And the boots. Get the boots.

17
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:13,246
Yeah, go check. I'll hold.

18
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:14,460
What are you babbling about?

19
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:16,211
- I want these boots.
- Those are work boots.

20
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:18,639
They're yellow and cute. I'll look like the Morton's Salt girl.

21
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:20,815
How the hell did you find something to buy in my boat supply catalogue?

22
00:01:20,886 --> 00:01:23,354
- Size nine, please?
- Yes, I'm here. None of them?

23
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:26,246
Well, at least you're consistent. Okay, backorder all of them.

24
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:29,170
Yes, the C-clamps, the teak buns, the marine caulk -

25
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:33,278
and one pair of fisherman's boots, size nine.

26
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:35,729
Of course, those you have. Okay.

27
00:01:35,822 --> 00:01:37,219
Send them right along. Uh-huh.

28
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,468
They'll be here Tuesday.

29
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,174
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

30
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:45,853
Hey, is it okay if I come over tonight and work on the boat a little?

31
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:49,348
With what? Sheer masculinity and some imaginary sandpaper?

32
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,775
I have plenty to do until the backorder stuff gets here.

33
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,169
All right. I thought you were going to spend the evening trying to figure out

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,542
how to fling yourself down the stairs just hard enough

35
00:01:56,598 --> 00:01:58,124
that you won't have to go to my parents' thing tomorrow,

36
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,546
but not so hard that you actually die.

37
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:04,098
No, I thought instead that I'd try to find a wild boar to maul me just enough

38
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:07,006
that I'll need medical attention so I won't be able to go to your parents' thing tomorrow,

39
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:10,018
but after some stitches and a transfusion, I'll still be able to make you coffee.

40
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:11,278
Oh, much better plan.

41
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:13,592
I've started to run the rigging. I just wanted to get a little further on it.

42
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:16,752
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Rory's spending the night. We're having a Cop Rock marathon.

43
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,154
Okay. Here's your donuts.

44
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,788
Thank you.

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,471
And your coffee.

46
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:20,069
Thank you.

47
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,485
And my final plea to not make me go to this thing tomorrow.

48
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:26,178
You do not have to go.

49
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,866
Fine. I'll go.

50
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:31,851
I love it when I break you with just the sheer anticipation of a wear-down!

51
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:34,123
Hold on, did you say Cop Rock marathon?

52
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,510
Yeah, I got 'em all on tape.

53
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,548
Trying to figure out what you see in me?

54
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:38,026
Yep.

55
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,146
Wait'll you see me in the boots.

56
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:37,924
Okay, I know I was the one that said I was craving mashed potatoes,

57
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:40,316
but, oh my God, they're a lot of work.

58
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:42,896
It's instant mashed potatoes. Key word: instant.

59
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,448
Oh, no, not instant.

60
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:48,052
I have to mix water and butter into it, not to mention the adding of salt and pepper.

61
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,438
***

62
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:55,400
Plus, I have to rip the package open, dump it into a bowl and, oh my God, are they serious?

63
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:58,035
I have to stir the mixture to combine? What is this, the Gulag?

64
00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:59,336
Hey, do you want the Arcade Fire?

65
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:00,300
- I don't know, do I?
- Yes.

66
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:03,764
Then yes. So basically once I'm finished with all this manual labor,

67
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,762
I still have to clean the bowl.

68
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,583
- And the spoon.
- What do I use the spoon for?

69
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:09,336
- Stir to combine.
- Pfft. Right.

70
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:10,462
What do I use the spoon for?

71
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,521
Oh, my mistake. Carry on.

72
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:13,744
So let's cut to the chase.

73
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:15,704
How badly do you want these mashed potatoes?

74
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:17,283
You wanted the mashed potatoes.

75
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,034
'Cause with tater tots I can just rip and dump.

76
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,242
Then stick with your strengths.

77
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,935
Brain master Brian Eno coming up next.

78
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:24,662
Who is it?

79
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:25,921
- It's me.
- Me who?

80
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:27,973
Rory, can you just open the door?

81
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:33,098
Do you have an extension cord I can use?

82
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:34,056
I'll go look.

83
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,300
Hi! Come on in.

84
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,685
No, that's all right. I don't want to disturb you guys.

85
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:38,945
Oh, you're not disturbing us.

86
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,163
Well, I'm dirty.

87
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,152
Well, so's the house.

88
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:45,023
And if I come in there I'll see what you guys are planning on eating and I'll want to kill myself.

89
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:48,243
It just so happens I am making a garden spring salad

90
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:51,182
with three bitter lettuces and a breaded French country chicken.

91
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:52,242
Really, you are?

92
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:53,036
No.

93
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:54,971
- So how's the boat coming?
- Slow.

94
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:57,158
Oh, well, you should've built a motorboat.

95
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:58,648
Extension cord.

96
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:01,652
Thank you. I'll let you get back to taking five years off your life.

97
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:04,584
Meh. They were the five where I would've been wearing fuschia lipstick

98
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,717
way beyond my lip line, so I wouldn't want 'em anyhow.

99
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:07,305
See you tomorrow.

100
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:08,401
Ten-thirty sharp.

101
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,548
Okay. That's it.

102
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:13,874
- First course ready?
- Ready!

103
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:15,205
Let's Cop Rock.

104
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:19,351
Hello?

105
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,923
I picked up my dress from the dressmaker and it's a disaster.

106
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:22,349
What?

107
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,520
I got it home and it's falling apart. I need you to fix it.

108
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:25,291
Uh, but -

109
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:26,721
- I'm coming over.
- No, Mom, I -

110
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:28,139
Yes, I need you to fix this.

111
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,848
I'm not the woman who made it. Make her fix it.

112
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:32,998
When a woman gives birth to a crack baby you do not buy her a puppy.

113
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,447
What does that mean?

114
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,904
I want this dress to be perfect for tomorrow, Lorelai.

115
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:37,933
Yes, Mom, but -

116
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:39,873
It's the most important day of my life, Lorelai!

117
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:42,049
It's not even the most important day of your marriage!

118
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:43,607
I'll be there in half an hour, Lorelai.

119
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:46,197
No. Hello? Mom? But -

120
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,768
- She's coming over.
- Why?

121
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:50,543
Because she won't buy her seamstress a puppy.

122
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:51,215
Oh, sure.

123
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,417
Something about her dress. Crap, what are we going to do?

124
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:54,103
I don't know!

125
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,772
We can't eat all of this before she gets here.

126
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,232
- Most of it.
- Sure, most of it.

127
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:59,155
But not the tater tots or the pizza tower.

128
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:01,275
Okay, we'll have to do the evening in two parts.

129
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:04,767
We'll watch one Cop Rock, eat this stuff here, she'll come over,

130
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,337
I'll get her dress done as fast as I can, then we'll continue with our evening.

131
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:08,622
Maybe we should put it off.

132
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,306
She comes, I fix, she goes, we Rock.

133
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:12,002
Now eat.

134
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:45,354
Hi, Emily. I just - I didn't see you standing there.

135
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,760
I'm just working on my boat.

136
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:48,780
You're building a boat?

137
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:49,501
Yes.

138
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,047
- Does it float?
- Not yet.

139
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,456
Aren't boats supposed to?

140
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:54,006
Eventually, yes.

141
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,394
Well, at least you have a hobby.

142
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:56,874
Yes. Thank God for that, huh?

143
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:58,364
Idle hands, and whatnot.

144
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,320
It will float eventually.

145
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,690
Oh, I'm sure it will.

146
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,470
I just have to do a little more -

147
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:04,702
Well, I should get inside.

148
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:06,496
Yeah, it's nice seeing you again.

149
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:07,534
Yes.

150
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:10,586
Oh! Uh, congratulations.

151
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:11,554
For what?

152
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:14,001
You know, your thing tomorrow, renewing your vows.

153
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:17,478
You congratulate the groom. You offer the bride best wishes.

154
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:18,338
Oh.

155
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:23,669
Uh, best wishes.

156
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:26,596
Why, thank you, Luke. How sweet of you to say.

157
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:27,990
I'll see you tomorrow.

158
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:29,509
Hey, I'm looking forward to it.

159
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,591
Mom, great. Come on in. Okay, so, is that the dress?

160
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:45,095
- Yes, yes -
- Okay, well, let me take a look here.

161
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:46,938
Hi, Grandma. Big day tomorrow, huh?

162
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:48,463
That wasn't your dinner, was it?

163
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,173
No, that was just the appetizer.

164
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:51,408
Oh, well that's a relief.

165
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:52,887
Mom, I don't see anything wrong.

166
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,515
Lorelai, are you blind? Look!

167
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:55,124
Where?

168
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:56,041
Right there.

169
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:58,816
That bead and that bead and that bead, all loose.

170
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:01,350
Okay, I see it now. I don't know how I missed it.

171
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:03,845
Well, this is going to take me no time at all, five minutes tops.

172
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:04,848
Well, don't rush it.

173
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:07,730
No, no, no rush. It's an easy job. Three and a half minutes and you're on you're way.

174
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:10,511
You don't even need to sit down, because by the time you do, this'll be done.

175
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:13,101
In fact you should have just left the car running 'cause that's how quick this is going to be.

176
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,252
So how you holding up, Grandma?

177
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:17,202
I'm a wreck, actually.

178
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:18,529
- Why?
- Well -

179
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,788
Two minutes and we're done!

180
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:22,740
I still can't decide exactly what to do with my hair,

181
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:27,351
and I have absolutely zero faith that my wedding planner is going to be able to pull this off -

182
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:29,435
Thirty seconds - someone clock me. What are you doing?

183
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:30,545
Do you have anything to drink?

184
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:32,332
No, no, Mom, why are you taking off your coat?

185
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:34,519
Some wine, or some chilled vodka, perhaps?

186
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:36,708
Yeah, but you might want to hold off on having a drink, Mom,

187
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,768
'cause you're going to be driving in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

188
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:40,075
Well, I could use a little something.

189
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:42,671
Calm my nerves about this wedding planner I hired.

190
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,064
I'm sure everything's going to be fine.

191
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,542
I don't see how it can be, everything is so last minute,

192
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:48,389
and I didn't even get a decent rehearsal!

193
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:52,466
Mom, I promise you, I have successfully walked in a straight line at least once before.

194
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,410
I can get you the cop's name if you want to talk to him.

195
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,617
Oh, well, it's too late to do anything about it now.

196
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,069
No, no, Mom. Wait, I'm almost there, I'm almost there! I'm done, I'm done, I'm done!

197
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,676
- Stop her from getting a drink.
- How?

198
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,673
Show her Nick Nolte's mug shot. Hello?

199
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:05,501
Lorelai! How are you?

200
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,811
I'm fine, Dad, how are you?

201
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:09,533
Oh, don't you worry about me. I am in good hands.

202
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:11,133
- Isn't that right, boys?
- Right!

203
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:12,878
Geez, Dad, hanging out at the bath house again?

204
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,131
I am at my bachelor party, Lorelai,

205
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:18,633
and I just thought I'd call and see how your little gathering was going.

206
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,794
- My -
- Now, I want you to have a wonderful time,

207
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:22,864
and go as crazy as you think is necessary.

208
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,200
But make sure your mother doesn't mix her alcohol.

209
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:28,966
Sometimes when she has a little bit too much vodka,

210
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,459
she forgets and she goes on to gin.

211
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,023
I need her sober and looking beautiful for tomorrow.

212
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,758
Otherwise you don't have to go through with it.

213
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:40,373
So, Dad, Mom told you we were having a party?

214
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:43,282
Well, she told me she was heading over to your house this evening

215
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:47,126
to spend a little time with "the girls", so I put it all together.

216
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,944
I'm a very brilliant man, Lorelai.

217
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:50,920
Anyhow, I won't keep you any longer.

218
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,510
Just return your mother in one piece, sans tattoos, please.

219
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:55,682
Okay. Will do.

220
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:58,668
Have a scandalous time. I'll see you girls tomorrow.

221
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:02,513
Okay, so here's a fun twist for your viewing pleasure.

222
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,789
My father thinks my mother is here for her bachelorette party.

223
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:07,391
What? Why does he think that?

224
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,641
I think she told him that.

225
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,718
Ah, were we supposed to throw her a bachelorette party?

226
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:14,479
I don't know. You're the maid of honor. Aren't you supposed to plan these things?

227
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:18,272
I didn't think you had a bachelorette party when you hadn't been a bachelorette for forty years.

228
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:21,084
Oh my God, she is going to hold this against me for the rest of my life.

229
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:22,424
So what do we do?

230
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,495
Davey had just fallen asleep.

231
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,010
I know, I'm sorry. Thank you for coming over at the last minute. Is that -

232
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,473
- Potstickers.
- Ah, I love you.

233
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,246
Hi, Sookie!

234
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,362
- Go on in the living room.
- Okay.

235
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:38,173
- The other living room.
- Okay.

236
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,648
You're going to have to open your eyes now.

237
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,746
Okay.

238
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:41,870
Hey, Lorelai.

239
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:43,852
Hey, Gypsy. Thanks for coming on such short notice.

240
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,346
I'm always up for a good party.

241
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,632
Emily is in the living room with the others.

242
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:47,276
Great.

243
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:48,433
Who's Emily?

244
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,631
Follow me, I'll point her out.

245
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:50,739
Okie dokie.

246
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,479
Look, everyone, it's Gypsy!

247
00:10:52,616 --> 00:10:55,724
Gypsy! Gypsy's here! Everyone, Gypsy's here!

248
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:56,943
Gypsy, that's Emily.

249
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:59,380
Come on, Gypsy, come over here and sit by me.

250
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,292
Okay.

251
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,358
I have to say, Lorelai, I am loving this drink.

252
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,606
Have you ever had one of these, Gypsy?

253
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:06,430
I don't know.

254
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:08,157
It's called a rum and coke.

255
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:12,299
You know, you may look high-brow, Emily, but underneath, you're just a broad.

256
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,079
Did you hear that, Gypsy, I'm a broad.

257
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:15,504
Yeah, I always suspected.

258
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,840
- How's it going?
- Great.

259
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,238
What are we doing here?

260
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,363
I tried to explain it to her, but it's not working.

261
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,994
We are throwing my grandmother a bachelorette party.

262
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,111
But she is married.

263
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,447
Yeah, but they're doing it again.

264
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:26,209
But why?

265
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:29,972
Because they want to tell each other that they love each other all over again.

266
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,843
But why?

267
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:31,878
Because they do.

268
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:32,656
But why?

269
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:33,418
Because it's fun.

270
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,156
But why?

271
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,354
Because -

272
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:37,730
Hey, you lasted one more 'But why' than I did.

273
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:40,950
So, Emily, tell us about this party of yours tomorrow.

274
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:43,276
It's going to be fabulous. Isn't it, Lorelai?

275
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,117
Ab fab, sweetie darling.

276
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,418
Isn't she hilarious?

277
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:49,516
I never have any idea what she's talking about, but she's so entertaining!

278
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,364
Like a chimp. Isn't she like a chimp, Gypsy?

279
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,574
Please make your mother stop talking to me.

280
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:55,753
If only I had that power.

281
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,272
The party is going to be very, very big.

282
00:11:58,374 --> 00:12:01,794
Flowers everywhere, and my dress is incredible.

283
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:03,182
The woman who made it is a genius.

284
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:04,410
So where's it going to be?

285
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:06,214
- The Windsor Club.
- Ooh, fancy.

286
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,826
Well, that ain't no toilet bowl.

287
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,870
No, it certainly is not. It is the perfect place to have my perfect wedding.

288
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,763
And what I had to go through to get it, let me tell you.

289
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:16,279
Lorelai, the cup's empty!

290
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:19,572
It was booked up two years in advance,

291
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:21,476
and the Sheldrakes had the Rose Room.

292
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,676
They were having a retirement party or something ridiculous like that,

293
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:27,303
and they simply refused to let us have the room.

294
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,376
They were stubborn, and selfish,

295
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:32,376
and now, after all the strings I pulled,

296
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,946
they are across town at the Bluestone Club,

297
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:38,925
with their piped-in music and their pornographic fountains.

298
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:42,530
***

299
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:47,015
I must say this is the best bachelorette party I ever had.

300
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:48,802
I really feel like we should play games or something,

301
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,473
or have naughty gifts like edible underwear or dirty-shaped pasta.

302
00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:54,649
Yeah, too bad - oh, oh! Just a sec.

303
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,681
Where is she going? Gypsy, where is she going?

304
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,293
What are you doing?

305
00:12:58,591 --> 00:12:59,553
No way!

306
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:00,618
Where did you get that?

307
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,520
You gave it to me.

308
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:02,825
Oh, yeah.

309
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:04,996
Mom, for you on your special night.

310
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:05,948
What's this?

311
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:10,203
Oh my God! Oh my God!

312
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:13,020
What are they laughing at?

313
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:16,425
Have a tater tot, Kyon.

314
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:23,996
My mother is fast asleep in my bed, clutching my Hello Kitty pillow,

315
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:25,359
and yes, I have pictures!

316
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,730
I cannot believe how much rum Grandma drank tonight.

317
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,953
How much rum she drank?

318
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,181
Hey, that's Grandma's bag.

319
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:31,251
What are you doing?

320
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,463
I have no idea, I am drunk.

321
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,697
Hey! Come back here with that.

322
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:45,137
What are you doing?

323
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,512
There is no way I'm sitting next to Missy Hollargan.

324
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:51,127
Stop that, that's Grandma's seating chart!

325
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:53,100
I know, I'm just fine-tuning it.

326
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:58,358
Oh, the Ramsey's divorce must be legal by now. Time for a little reunion.

327
00:13:58,445 --> 00:13:59,995
You're evil and I'm going to tell.

328
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:02,489
Well if you tell, then I'm going to tell cousin Drew,

329
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:04,712
aka the Power Spitter, that you like him.

330
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:05,848
You're mean.

331
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:09,698
Hmm. Man, I'll say one thing for my parents, they certainly command a good turnout.

332
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:14,527
Hey, do you think the Sheldrakes will be unhappy at the Bluestone Club?

333
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,377
Oh, I have no idea. However, I do know that Dinky Shaw is going to be sitting

334
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:21,363
next to her ex-husband's daughter from his second marriage.

335
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,716
This is the daughter whose conception caused the second marriage.

336
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,709
And everybody should bring an extra roll of film.

337
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,602
Seems mean. Getting them kicked out like that. Seems mean.

338
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:29,538
Seems Gilmore.

339
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:30,312
Mom -

340
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,994
Rory, this is how it works in my parents' world.

341
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:36,733
Trust me, the Sheldrakes are busy screwing someone at the Bluestone out of something as we speak.

342
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:37,669
If you say so.

343
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:41,489
These people live in a universe where they feel entitled to get what they want,

344
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,828
when they want it, and they don't care who's in their way.

345
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:44,725
I hate that world.

346
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:46,338
Vapid. Selfish.

347
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:48,651
It's like that Life and Death Brigade you wrote about.

348
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:49,543
What do you mean?

349
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,767
You know, like a bunch of selfish rich kids, the children of entitlement,

350
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:55,742
blowing off school. Drinking for days.

351
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,255
Spending thousands on a stupid and potentially dangerous stunt,

352
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:01,396
knowing full well that they're not going to get in trouble,

353
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:03,229
'cause Daddy is important. They're all the same.

354
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,056
They're not all the same. You don't even know them.

355
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,826
And that's not what I wrote. I didn't say all those things about them.

356
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:09,884
You're just reading whatever you want to into it.

357
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:11,158
Okay, sorry.

358
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:14,375
Just because you have money, that doesn't automatically make you a jerk.

359
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:15,782
I know. I didn't mean it like that.

360
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:22,419
So, new subject?

361
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:24,129
Yeah, new subject.

362
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:31,572
Hey, I wonder if my mother would notice if she and Dad were suddenly at different tables.

363
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:33,995
Okay.

364
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:37,860
Hey, have you seen my Sparkly Venom lip gloss?

365
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,310
Yes, I have, it's at school.

366
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:40,727
Well, as long as it's safe.

367
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:41,649
Hey, what time is it?

368
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:43,200
Ten thirty-five. Rats!

369
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,417
Rory, can you get that?

370
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,591
I'm not dressed yet!

371
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,705
You're not? It's ten thirty-five!

372
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:49,443
So?

373
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,401
Finally, that childish punctuality of yours has worn off.

374
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:53,104
Stop.

375
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:54,135
My baby's a woman.

376
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,257
Hello?

377
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:56,323
Luke?

378
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:59,114
Yeah. Uh... the front door was open.

379
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,333
I'll be right there.

380
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:01,054
Hi, Luke!

381
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,186
Hey, Rory.

382
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:06,128
You know your front door was open? It wasn't like that all night, was it?

383
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,160
Hey! You look nice!

384
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:08,908
You're not dressed.

385
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:10,388
No, I'm getting dressed there.

386
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,222
I didn't know you could get dressed there.

387
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:13,352
Rory, let's motor!

388
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,663
I would have gotten dressed there.

389
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:16,891
'Kay, I'm ready.

390
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,160
Hey, you look nice.

391
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,489
Yeah, I didn't know you could get dressed there.

392
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:21,192
Don't worry about it.

393
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,993
You didn't mention there was a place to get dressed there.

394
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,186
Oh, we're late. Let's go!

395
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:29,402
Wait, aren't you going to lock up?

396
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,385
Babette, lock up when you leave?

397
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:33,362
You got it, honey!

398
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:35,793
Oh, you look nice.

399
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,605
Oh, please let them not be here yet.

400
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:42,486
They'll be here.

401
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:43,894
Well, you tell them you were running late.

402
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:45,256
You were running late too.

403
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,155
My pants are all wrinkled from the ride.

404
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:48,262
- Do you see them?
- No.

405
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:49,480
It looks like I slept in them.

406
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:51,374
Hey, stop being such a Nancy-boy about the pants.

407
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,820
Think Hemingway ever gave a crap what his pants looked like?

408
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,367
Hemingway blew his brains out, also.

409
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:57,401
How much of a role model do you want me to make this guy?

410
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:00,359
- Well, there they are.
- Hello, girls.

411
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:02,372
Apparently they're going to change here also.

412
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:05,335
Sorry, um, Rory had a little emergency.

413
00:17:05,418 --> 00:17:06,513
So did Mom.

414
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:07,902
I hope everything's all right.

415
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:09,550
Yes. Just fine. How is everything going?

416
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,039
Utter disaster.

417
00:17:11,184 --> 00:17:14,070
That moronic wedding planner finally fulfilled her potential.

418
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,348
I get here and I go through my seating chart, and it's a mess.

419
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:19,821
It looked like a drunken psychopath took a stab at it.

420
00:17:19,953 --> 00:17:21,786
I had to re-do the entire thing.

421
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,794
It took me two hours and years off my life.

422
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:25,381
Maybe she just got confused.

423
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:28,074
She did get confused. Confused about what her profession should be.

424
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:30,696
Anyway, I fired her. That should help clarify things for her.

425
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,241
Third realm of hell, party of one.

426
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:34,638
Mom, how could you fire her now? Who's going to run the wedding?

427
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,582
Well, luckily Marilyn came into town early for the ceremony,

428
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:38,883
and she offered to help out.

429
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,918
You know that Marilyn was a very intimate friend of Cecil Beaton.

430
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,358
He named an end table after her.

431
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,344
And on top of all that,

432
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,986
even though we managed to get the Sheldrakes out of the Rose Room,

433
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,749
the women's club that owns this place has their still life painting class

434
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:54,929
at four today in the Salon, and they refuse to give it up.

435
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,195
Are you using the Salon?

436
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:57,873
Of course we're not using the Salon.

437
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,639
What on earth would we use the Salon for?

438
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:02,282
Oh, Luke. You're here.

439
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:04,677
Uh, have been, actually.

440
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:05,880
Richard, did you see Luke?

441
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:07,894
No. Why, Luke, there you are.

442
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:10,770
Hey, Mr. Gilmore. Best wish- congrat-

443
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:13,739
- Nice suit.
- Thank you, Luke.

444
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:17,042
I can have my tailor steam out those trousers for you.

445
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:19,567
Oh, Richard, that's not what he's wearing to the ceremony.

446
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:20,964
I'm sure he's going to change.

447
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:23,247
All right, girls. Let's go get settled.

448
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,866
Are you okay to hang here for a while?

449
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:26,566
I'm sure. I'm fine. You go.

450
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:32,014
Emily. The florist is here and everything looks fabulous.

451
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,560
- Really?
- No.

452
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:35,167
But it will.

453
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:38,156
Lorelai, you look divine.

454
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:40,825
Oh, and Rory. That skin.

455
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:43,734
Gorgeous, I can't find the words.

456
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:46,073
And who is this?

457
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,766
Oh, Marilyn, this is Luke. Luke, this is my cousin Marilyn.

458
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:49,555
Nice to meet you.

459
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:50,911
You, too.

460
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:53,856
Is he a gardener?

461
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,653
Uh, no, he owns a diner.

462
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:58,551
Oh, I've always wanted to have an affair with a gardener.

463
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:01,112
Apparently that's very 'in' now.

464
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,318
Marilyn, we're going to the bridal room now.

465
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:05,775
And I have gardenias to deal with.

466
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:07,454
I'll see you in a little while.

467
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:10,091
I'll be the handsome one holding the ring.

468
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:11,375
My favorite kind of man.

469
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,282
Psst, Lorelai. I need you to do something.

470
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,409
Oh, spy voice. Cool.

471
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:18,073
- Focus, please?
- I am a camera.

472
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:21,192
I want to give your mother a present. But I don't know what her dress looks like.

473
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:27,289
So, I need you to take these, wait till she's not looking, hold them up to the dress,

474
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,756
pick the one that looks best, bring it back to me and I will give it to her.

475
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,489
- Got it?
- Got it.

476
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:31,160
Go.

477
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:44,226
Which one do you want?

478
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:46,156
That one, the other for my birthday.

479
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,394
Look at that, it's so fancy.

480
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,123
Your grandfather has perfect taste in necklaces and earrings.

481
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,812
It's very important to find a man who can pick out your jewelry.

482
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:55,061
Or steal it.

483
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,884
Where are you going?

484
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,553
Uh, to give Dad back the necklaces.

485
00:19:58,654 --> 00:19:59,725
Hang your dress up first.

486
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:00,672
I'm going to go change.

487
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,710
Great. Come back as Thora Birch.

488
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:06,934
Oh, Lord, look at that. Pierre has his work cut out for him today.

489
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,207
Stop it, Mom, you look gorgeous.

490
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,116
Lorelai, why am I doing this?

491
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,779
Oh, yes. It is pretty, isn't it?

492
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:15,556
It's pretty frickin' awesome is what it is.

493
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:18,172
Oh my God, I'm so nervous, I haven't eaten a thing all day.

494
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:20,124
Do you want me to whip up a little pasta for you, Mom?

495
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,608
Stop that. Maybe I should take a Seconal.

496
00:20:22,683 --> 00:20:24,752
Excellent idea, Judy. All right, my dress is hung.

497
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:27,583
Make sure you hurry back. Lisette will be here to do your hair any minute.

498
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:28,489
My hair is already done.

499
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:29,734
Don't worry. She can fix it.

500
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:33,522
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I'm just so nervous, I can't think.

501
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,817
- Why are you nervous?
- I'm getting married!

502
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:38,192
For the second time. Mom, it's a pretend wedding.

503
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:39,533
J.Lo has them all the time!

504
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,515
Well, it certainly feels like a real wedding.

505
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:43,450
After all, we've been separated for months.

506
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:45,867
I'd almost forgotten what it was like to have a man around the house.

507
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:47,926
Oh, God, I missed him.

508
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:52,360
It's a wonderful thing to have a husband, a partner, somebody who's always there.

509
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:55,038
Oh, Lorelai, don't you think you'll ever want to be married?

510
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,702
Well, um -

511
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:00,500
actually, I do.

512
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:03,403
Well, that's nice.

513
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,295
Best man in the house!

514
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,049
Oh, my goodness, Rory, you absolutely look adorable!

515
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,236
Say, aren't you the culture Queer Eye guy?

516
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,155
Ignore her, you look dashing.

517
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:15,559
Yeah, now go buy me some earrings.

518
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:16,235
I like it.

519
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:18,319
Hey, it's not fair that she gets to dress like that.

520
00:21:18,396 --> 00:21:19,654
Your dress is beautiful.

521
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,906
Yeah, but she gets to wear, like, a costume.

522
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:23,432
Can’t I dress like your maid?

523
00:21:23,603 --> 00:21:24,915
It’ll be whimsical and I can wear flats.

524
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:26,699
Go give the necklaces back to your father.

525
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,395
You so like her better.

526
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,182
So, tell me, Luke,

527
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:52,633
have you ever considered being a gardener?

528
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:55,910
Uh, I’m not much good at growing things.

529
00:21:56,013 --> 00:22:00,179
Oh, Luke. That’s the least important part of being a gardener.

530
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:25,895
May you all be seated, please.

531
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:32,356
I have known Richard and Emily Gilmore for twenty years now.

532
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:37,445
I know them to be two of the most formidable opponents the world has ever seen.

533
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:41,513
They complement each other. They defend each other.

534
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,911
They were made for each other.

535
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:47,147
And today, in front of friends and family,

536
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:50,752
Richard and Emily have chosen once again to say to each other,

537
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:52,703
I choose you”..

538
00:23:53,544 --> 00:23:59,737
How many of us in a lifetime even get chosen once for something we really want?

539
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,619
Richard and Emily, will you please face each other.

540
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,394
Please repeat after me.

541
00:24:06,874 --> 00:24:08,273
I, Richard Gilmore.

542
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:10,151
I, Richard Gilmore…

543
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:15,380
And over here we have the Romanov table.

544
00:24:15,477 --> 00:24:17,555
Wow. Look at those flower arrangements.

545
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:20,941
This thing must’ve cost a fortune! They’re real orchids.

546
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:22,946
- A little gayer, please.
- I’m just saying.

547
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:26,010
Oh, wasn’t the ceremony perfect?

548
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:28,553
The candles and that judge.

549
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:30,223
I should have married him.

550
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:33,316
I was such a snob, I wouldn’t have a civil servant.

551
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:36,618
You’re saving a dance for me.

552
00:24:37,716 --> 00:24:39,234
Oh my God, there’s dancing?

553
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:42,735
Yeah. We’re doing the one from Pulp Fiction. Do you want to be Uma, or should I?

554
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:44,181
I’ll meet you guys at our table later.

555
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:45,127
Table five, hon.

556
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:48,403
Aw, man. I’ve already seen ten people I hate,

557
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:51,144
twenty people I know whose names I can’t remember,

558
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,169
and forty people I don’t know but who will expect me to know them anyhow.

559
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:55,798
A bar. Thank God.

560
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:59,095
Hey, I need you to run major introduction interference for me.

561
00:24:59,161 --> 00:24:59,593
What?

562
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:02,136
Well, you have the advantage. No one knows you here,

563
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:04,373
you can’t insult them by forgetting their names.

564
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:06,099
- Vodka tonic.
- And a beer.

565
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,520
Someone comes up, I’ll take a drink. My mouth will be full, I can’t talk.

566
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,576
How would that look, right? Then you jump in, offer your hand.

567
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:16,047
‘Hi, Luke Danes. And you are?’ ‘I’m Mr. Blockenfeffer. ’

568
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:20,512
By then I will have swallowed. ‘Oh hi, Mr. Blockenfeffer, I’m Lorelai, remember me?’

569
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,501
‘The bane of your mother’s existence?’ ‘Exactly. Nice to see you again. ’

570
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:25,847
‘Nice to see you again. And nice to meet you, Luke. ’

571
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:28,854
‘Nice to meet you, Mr. Blockenfeffer. ’ ‘You kids have a lovely evening. ’

572
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:31,546
‘No, you have a lovely evening. Our love to Mrs. Blockenfeffer. ’

573
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:32,630
- Oh, look.
- What?

574
00:25:32,902 --> 00:25:36,901
My Aunt Totsy. Mmm. Lovely woman. She hugs you, you smell like her for a month.

575
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,412
Yep. Keep these coming.

576
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,189
Thanks.

577
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:56,941
Actually, it’s not that difficult at all.

578
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,594
You just start with the siblings and count down even generations.

579
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,477
The children of siblings are first cousins,

580
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:03,920
the grandchildren of siblings are second cousins and so on.

581
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:06,228
That makes you and Ceci third cousins,

582
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:09,069
because Mee-maw and your great-great aunt Mary were sisters. See?

583
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:12,855
Now, if the generations aren’t even, that’s where you indicate with ‘removed’.

584
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:15,251
For example, you’re Trip’s second cousin,

585
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:18,353
but Trip’s daughter is your second cousin, once removed.

586
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,669
So if Ceci ever has grandchildren, you’ll be third cousins twice removed,

587
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:25,178
whereas they will be my second cousins thrice removed,

588
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,475
and my great-grandchildren’s fifth cousins. See, it’s not –

589
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:30,666
I’m Bruce McAllister, and this is my wife, Susan.

590
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:34,097
Well, it’s very nice to meet you, Bruce, and Susan.

591
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:37,035
Hi, Bruce, remember me? Lorelai?

592
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:39,217
Yes, it’s nice to see you again.

593
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:41,756
Well, we should find our table. We’ll talk to you later?

594
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:42,828
Okay. ‘Bye, Bruce.

595
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:43,672
‘Bye, Susan.

596
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,245
That’s what I’m talking about.

597
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,521
Mmm. Whoops, Marilyn’s getting Totsied.

598
00:26:53,764 --> 00:26:56,599
Oh! How are you doing? You having a good time?

599
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:57,777
It’s okay.

600
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:01,141
Good. Um, I have to tell you something.

601
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:02,887
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, um...

602
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:04,664
Christopher’s here.

603
00:27:05,252 --> 00:27:07,945
Oh, well, I guess he knows your parents, so –

604
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:09,518
Yeah, but, um,

605
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:13,829
so Christopher’s father died a couple weeks ago, and, um,

606
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:16,523
he took it pretty hard. He had a terrible relationship with the man.

607
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:20,873
I went over there one night. The night before the re-enactment.

608
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:25,472
Um, I brought tequila and we talked and drank, just two old friends hanging out. That’s all.

609
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,905
- You went over there?
- To comfort him.

610
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:30,080
I know I should have told you about it, I just didn’t because

611
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:34,191
I didn’t want you to read anything into it, or think anything weird,

612
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,700
and I’m only telling you now because he’s here and it might come up,

613
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,257
and I don’t want you to feel shanghaied.

614
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:39,773
Yeah, that would be bad.

615
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:43,448
I’m sorry, Luke. Nothing happened. Please believe me.

616
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,183
- Hey, Lor.
- Hi, Chris. You know Luke.

617
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,317
Uh, no, not really. I’m Christopher.

618
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:49,608
Yeah. Heard a lot about you.

619
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,574
You, too. The coffee is legendary.

620
00:27:51,763 --> 00:27:52,870
Luke and I are dating.

621
00:27:53,113 --> 00:27:53,815
That’s great.

622
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,295
Have been for, what, four months now?

623
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:59,565
Man, time, it flies when you’re having fun, huh? Big fun.

624
00:27:59,837 --> 00:28:01,741
Nothing sexual intended, although –

625
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,190
Sorry about your dad.

626
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:04,660
Yeah. Thanks.

627
00:28:04,744 --> 00:28:06,627
I told him about your dad, and the tequila.

628
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:09,862
Oh, yeah. It was rough, Lorelai helped me a lot, just being there.

629
00:28:09,976 --> 00:28:11,655
She’s a very considerate person.

630
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:14,449
Hey, who likes my dress?

631
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:18,004
‘Cause, man, you should have seen the one my mother wanted me to wear.

632
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:19,643
You’re cutting off my circulation.

633
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,272
I’m sorry.

634
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,484
Hey, so where’s that kid of ours?

635
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:26,519
Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to present to you for the first time, this century,

636
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:29,359
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Gilmore.

637
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:32,320
Well, we should take our seats, now, see you later, Chris.

638
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:33,631
- We’ll have a drink.
- Be great.

639
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:44,956
Something wrong?

640
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,450
Coffee sucks.

641
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:53,225
Thank you.

642
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:57,659
On behalf of myself and my second wife, Emily,

643
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,644
I would like to thank you all for coming here to help us celebrate.

644
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:04,073
You are good friends, and we are very, very lucky.

645
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:07,423
Now, in planning our traditional first dance,

646
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,251
I gave a lot of thought to the song

647
00:29:09,337 --> 00:29:11,999
that would represent the next phase in our marriage.

648
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:14,334
The best phase in our marriage, I believe.

649
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:19,183
I went over all the greats – Bennett, Sinatra, Chuck Berry –

650
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,339
and a story popped into my head.

651
00:29:21,414 --> 00:29:23,643
Now, most of you know my daughter, Lorelai.

652
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,973
When Lorelai was three, she went through a period of having chronic ear infections.

653
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:30,037
It was terrible.

654
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:34,170
Screaming all night long, we couldn’t keep a nanny longer than a week.

655
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:37,258
Yeah, that was the terrible part. The searing pain was just a side note.

656
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:40,058
And so, it fell to Emily to sit with her all night long.

657
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:42,050
She tried everything to calm her down.

658
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:45,383
Finally, she found a song that seemed to soothe her.

659
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,803
It was a popular song on the radio and it soon became Emily’s favorite.

660
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:50,406
Of course, it drove me crazy –

661
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:54,440
some woman complaining about how she wanted to marry a man named Bill.

662
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:56,283
Not exactly Cole Porter.

663
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,271
Emily would tease me, saying,

664
00:29:58,356 --> 00:30:01,640
‘If only your name was Bill, then this could be our song. ’

665
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:04,262
Well, Emily, for tonight,

666
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:05,857
and tonight only,

667
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:07,604
my name is Bill,

668
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:09,857
and this is our song.

669
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:11,311
Hit the button, Johnny.

670
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:13,256
Your hand, madam.

671
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,043
I cannot believe you remembered this song.

672
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:26,508
Bill, I love you so, I always will

673
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:33,578
I look at you and see the passion eyes of May

674
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:40,895
Oh, but am I ever gonna see my wedding day?

675
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:51,540
I was on your side, Bill, when you were losing

676
00:30:51,964 --> 00:30:58,902
I’d never scheme or lie, Bill, there’s been no fooling

677
00:30:59,097 --> 00:31:06,112
But kisses and love won’t carry me till you marry me, Bill

678
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:09,352
- We should separate more often.
- Oh, bite your tongue.

679
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:18,057
At this time, if you’re in love, I invite you to join Emily and Richard on the dance floor.

680
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,387
- You wanna dance?
- No, thanks.

681
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:28,493
Please? I promise I will dance just as spazzy as you will.

682
00:31:28,547 --> 00:31:30,129
I do not dance spazzy.

683
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:32,557
Then I will be the only spaz on the floor.

684
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:35,116
Please?

685
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:38,552
I do not dance spazzy.

686
00:31:40,204 --> 00:31:41,142
Thank you.

687
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,026
But kisses and love won’t carry me

688
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:50,671
Till you marry me, Bill

689
00:31:51,214 --> 00:31:55,909
I love you so, I always will

690
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:02,877
And though devotion rules my heart I take no bows

691
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:10,378
But Bill, you'll never gonna take those wedding vows

692
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:19,952
Want some company?

693
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:22,153
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

694
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:23,081
Have a seat.

695
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:26,987
Quite a party, huh?

696
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:29,439
I would expect nothing less from your grandparents.

697
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:32,467
- Pretty flowers.
- Yes. Not at all fake.

698
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,495
Like my suit?

699
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,783
I do. It’s very Bugsy Malone.

700
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:37,703
So how you doing?

701
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:42,286
Me? Oh, I’m fine. Just –

702
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,232
Did your mother ever tell you about our first kiss?

703
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:48,553
No.

704
00:32:49,854 --> 00:32:53,714
We were fourteen. It was after school in the parking lot of the AM/PM.

705
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:56,125
She just walked right up and kissed me.

706
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,421
- Really?
- Yep.

707
00:32:57,796 --> 00:33:00,494
Said she just wanted to know what it would be like.

708
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,842
I hope you at least bought her a Moonpie.

709
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:06,515
You know, it never would’ve crossed my mind to do something like that.

710
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,222
Just walk up and kiss someone, ‘cause you wanted to.

711
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:12,121
But Lorelai –

712
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:14,312
she always knew what she wanted.

713
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,319
And she’d go out and get it.

714
00:33:18,536 --> 00:33:20,144
She never told me that story.

715
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:23,754
No. Probably wanted to make me seem more manly.

716
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:26,355
Did you –

717
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,284
Did I what?

718
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:33,251
Did you like it that she kissed you first?

719
00:33:33,983 --> 00:33:37,260
Who could not like being kissed by a Gilmore girl?

720
00:33:40,245 --> 00:33:42,176
It was the greatest day of my life.

721
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:48,002
I’m going to get a refill, can I get you something?

722
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:49,294
No. I’m fine.

723
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:52,236
Okay, well, I’ll see you back in the center ring.

724
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,092
Okay.

725
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:06,005
Okay, there’s a touch of spazzy in there.

726
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,841
Can we stop dancing now?

727
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:09,542
We can.

728
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:11,667
Uh, but Marilyn is standing right behind you

729
00:34:11,729 --> 00:34:14,427
and if we swap she’s going to swoop in, there’s nothing I can do to save you.

730
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:16,679
Well, funny how Marilyn’s been standing right behind me

731
00:34:16,746 --> 00:34:18,568
where I can’t see her for the last two songs.

732
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:20,079
Yeah, I know. That woman is spooky.

733
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:23,484
This wouldn’t be some underhanded ploy of yours to keep me dancing, would it?

734
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:25,681
Why, Luke Danes, I am appalled at the insinuation.

735
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:28,655
I should walk off this dance floor right now and leave you to your fate.

736
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:30,955
But I’m much too sweet a person to do that.

737
00:34:35,252 --> 00:34:37,765
Much better. Lowers the spaz quotient.

738
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:45,255
I like the suit, Kashmir.

739
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,150
I didn’t know you were going to be here.

740
00:34:47,312 --> 00:34:49,053
Really? I thought you put my name on the list.

741
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:50,011
No.

742
00:34:50,165 --> 00:34:52,029
Oh, well, it must be your grandparents invited me.

743
00:34:52,096 --> 00:34:53,431
My parents are around here somewhere.

744
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,279
Oh, so you came with your parents?

745
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,119
Yup.

746
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:58,818
- And –
- And, what?

747
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,169
Where’s the blonde?

748
00:35:00,282 --> 00:35:01,127
She’s at the bar.

749
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,848
Oh, yeah, she’s pretty.

750
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,203
Yeah? You want me to hook you up?

751
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,258
- No, I was just saying –
- What are you just saying?

752
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:10,400
That she’s pretty. That you brought a pretty girl.

753
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:13,534
She’s pretty, and the two of you are pretty together. In case you were wondering.

754
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:16,283
Jewel’s a friend of the family, I’ve known here forever.

755
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,955
She’s visiting her parents in town, and she had nothing to do,

756
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:21,266
so she asked to tag along. We’re not dating.

757
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:24,774
Do you want to dance?

758
00:35:29,324 --> 00:35:30,102
After you.

759
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,831
What’s that?

760
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,872
Ugh, Totsy alert! Move, move!

761
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:51,140
What?

762
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:53,020
Why did you come?

763
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:54,335
Open bar.

764
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:58,170
Quite a draw for a guy with an American Express black card.

765
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:00,463
- Live band, salad, butter pats –
- Logan –

766
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:02,521
Little knit bags full of those Jordan almonds –

767
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,954
Are you ever going to ask me out?

768
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,244
You flirt with me. You act like you like me a little.

769
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,851
You show up here, with a friend, not a date.

770
00:36:13,156 --> 00:36:15,680
I mean, aren’t you? Ever?

771
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:19,463
You do like me, right?

772
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:25,398
Oh. Okay. Uh, no problem.

773
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:28,425
I’ll just, um, let you go back to your table,

774
00:36:28,532 --> 00:36:31,399
and I’ll just start burrowing directly into the ground.

775
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:31,886
Rory.

776
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:33,605
- I should be in China by midnight.
- Rory.

777
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:35,121
You called me Rory.

778
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:37,467
- I want to be clear.
- Oh, good.

779
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:40,667
I have thought about asking you out, several times. I just don’t think it’s such a good idea.

780
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:41,465
Why not?

781
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:44,389
Because you’re special.

782
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:48,899
Special, like ‘Stop eating the paste’, special?

783
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:51,213
You are beautiful. You are intelligent.

784
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,105
You are incredibly interesting. You’re definitely girlfriend material.

785
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,742
I, however, am definitely not boyfriend material.

786
00:36:56,825 --> 00:36:59,743
I can’t do commitment, and I don’t want to pretend to you that I can.

787
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,295
If I were to date you, there would be no dating.

788
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,008
It would be something, right away, and I’m not that guy.

789
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:06,102
But’ I’m not looking for anything something like.

790
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:06,830
Rory.

791
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:09,309
I’m not. I’ve done that.

792
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:13,193
As a matter of fact, I just did that, and that’s not what I want.

793
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:15,584
I’m not saying you want that right now.

794
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:17,827
No, I don’t want that at all.

795
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,146
No, I’m not expecting anything.

796
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:26,244
I’m just – I like you, and I want to spend some time with you.

797
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,298
No strings attached.

798
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:30,177
No strings attached, huh.

799
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:34,089
Hey, girls just wanna have fun. Stringless fun.

800
00:37:34,749 --> 00:37:37,340
- You may feel like that now, but –
- I do feel like that now.

801
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:38,519
Okay, but –

802
00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:40,208
Where are we going?

803
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,656
How should I know? What, do you think I have a plan or something? Geez.

804
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:46,895
Live in the moment, Huntzberger.

805
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:49,869
Coming?

806
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:03,309
Champagne?

807
00:38:09,148 --> 00:38:11,931
Look, are you sure you want to do this?

808
00:38:15,868 --> 00:38:19,678
I just want to know what it would be like.

809
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:29,107
I feel like I’m kissing a guy.

810
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:41,786
And apparently I had no idea what I was missing.

811
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:06,577
Here you go.

812
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,654
Oh, no. You’ve been Totsied.

813
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:11,010
Well, you left me alone.

814
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,363
I warned you about her.

815
00:39:12,454 --> 00:39:14,765
I turn around, she’s headed right for me, what am I supposed to do?

816
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:15,772
Ugh, man.

817
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,409
It’s not that bad.

818
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:18,737
Yeah, of course not.

819
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,396
Thought I’d come by for that drink.

820
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:23,448
Man, you’ve been Totsied!

821
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:26,392
- Didn’t you warn him?
- I tried. Moves slow.

822
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:28,163
Don’t worry about it, man, we’ve all been there.

823
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:30,902
Lorelai and I went to a funeral, we got Totsied twice!

824
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,168
- You remember?
- Um, no.

825
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:35,674
No? Come on, it was raining. You were wearing your ‘Hell is for children’ t-shirt,

826
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:38,034
your mom flipped because we snuck that flask in?

827
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:39,796
Huh, sorry, no memory at all. You want to dance?

828
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:42,331
Dance? Get second-hand Totsied, Lor.

829
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:44,737
You know you should burn that suit when you get home.

830
00:39:45,214 --> 00:39:46,078
Hey, how’s the Inn?

831
00:39:46,422 --> 00:39:47,903
You know, we had lunch at the Inn last month.

832
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:48,669
I know.

833
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:50,793
The Inn is fine. Everything is fine.

834
00:39:50,881 --> 00:39:52,253
Honey, so sorry to interrupt.

835
00:39:52,382 --> 00:39:55,437
Your parents want a picture of just the wedding party

836
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,072
in front of the cake before they cut it.

837
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:58,771
Okay, I’ll just, uh, go find Rory.

838
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:02,687
I think I saw her heading off that way with that darling blonde boy.

839
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:06,753
I’ve forgiven her for not noticing that I was chatting with him earlier.

840
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:09,978
Really, well, I’ll go get Rory and meet you back at the cake.

841
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:11,038
I’ll go with you.

842
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,589
Listen, uh, I think we need to talk.

843
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:22,180
I know, I know. We will. I just – let me try to find –

844
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:27,416
Grandma wants a picture.

845
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:28,426
Of this?

846
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,075
- Rory, what are you doing?
- Mom –

847
00:40:30,147 --> 00:40:34,159
You’re at your grandparents’ wedding! Renewal – vowal – thing. Whatever.

848
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:36,521
They’re right out there. God, Rory, I swear!

849
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:37,647
Rory? Rory’s in here?

850
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:38,913
Okay, don’t, Chris, it’s all right.

851
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:41,263
What the hell are you doing in here with my daughter?

852
00:40:41,354 --> 00:40:42,383
- I –
- Get away from her.

853
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:44,293
That is my daughter! I will kick your ass!

854
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,775
I will kick your ass, you little weasel!

855
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:48,517
- Get out!
- What the hell is going on?

856
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:49,634
Who’s that guy, Lorelai?

857
00:40:49,726 --> 00:40:51,451
Christopher, calm down! You’re drunk!

858
00:40:51,513 --> 00:40:53,653
Calm down? There’s a guy in there pawing my daughter!

859
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,307
What guy? There’s a guy in there with Rory?

860
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:56,178
Oh, my God, Luke!

861
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:58,947
Hey! Get your hands off her. I mean it. Right now!

862
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,757
Hands in the air, I want to see hands in the air!

863
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,557
Out!

864
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:06,996
I think you guys better use the back way out of here.

865
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,448
- But, Dad – Luke –
- I will take care of Dad and Luke.

866
00:41:09,545 --> 00:41:10,795
Please go, now, go!

867
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:14,732
So, um, you must be Logan.

868
00:41:14,844 --> 00:41:16,406
Uh, yeah.

869
00:41:16,496 --> 00:41:17,374
I’m Lorelai.

870
00:41:17,854 --> 00:41:18,679
Nice to meet you.

871
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:22,622
- Okay, well, I’d better –
- Yeah.

872
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:26,104
It’s none of your business what’s going on with Rory.

873
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:27,311
It sure the hell is my business.

874
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:28,255
Oh, guys, please!

875
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:30,143
Rory is my daughter. Mine.

876
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,697
Oh, really? Well then, where the hell were you when she got the chicken pox

877
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:35,565
and would only eat mashed potatoes for a week,

878
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:39,508
or where were you when she graduated high school, or started college? Huh?

879
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,382
Who the hell moved her mattress into her dorm,

880
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:43,737
and out of her dorm and back into her dorm again?

881
00:41:43,813 --> 00:41:45,032
Luke, please. This is not the time.

882
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:46,912
Where I was doesn’t concern you.

883
00:41:46,993 --> 00:41:49,563
Rory is my daughter, and Lorelai’s daughter, and that’s it.

884
00:41:49,651 --> 00:41:51,658
- Well, I’m with Lorelai!
- For now!

885
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,450
What does that mean, for now? What is that, a threat?

886
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:57,269
Lorelai and I belong together. Everyone knows it! I know it, Emily knows it!

887
00:41:57,443 --> 00:41:57,992
What?

888
00:41:58,078 --> 00:42:00,894
Look, I blew it, okay? I know that I blew it.

889
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,782
You waited, and I didn’t come through, and now you’re with him. But it’s not too late!

890
00:42:03,858 --> 00:42:04,627
Chris, don’t.

891
00:42:04,712 --> 00:42:06,429
It’s not too late. I know it’s not too late.

892
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:08,339
Emily told me it wasn’t too late!

893
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:10,740
I mean, that’s why I’m here, okay? I know you’re with him.

894
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:13,838
But it’s for now, it’s not forever. It’s just for now. I know that.

895
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,018
Luke, I don’t know what he’s talking about!

896
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:17,059
I got to get out of here.

897
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:18,958
- Oh, Luke, wait –
- Please, just, just –

898
00:42:19,025 --> 00:42:20,130
Christopher, get out of my way!

899
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,237
Will you stop?

900
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:28,415
Get away from me, Christopher.

901
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:31,236
- I just want to talk.
- Get some coffee, Christopher!

902
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:34,397
This wasn’t the way I wanted it to go down. I wanted to get you alone and –

903
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:36,207
- What are you doing?
- I’m going after Luke!

904
00:42:36,295 --> 00:42:39,315
Oh, there you are! I’ve got her!

905
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:45,910
Oh, you cannot keep a room full of Anglo-Saxons waiting for cake this long!

906
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:48,639
They start to form more clubs.

907
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:52,822
- Take her, take her, take her!
- All right, wonderful. There we are.

908
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:56,612
Okay. Everyone, in just a little closer.

909
00:42:57,363 --> 00:42:59,289
That’s perfect, hold that.

910
00:43:01,108 --> 00:43:02,638
You and me, we’re done.

911
00:43:03,092 --> 00:43:05,295
One, two, three.

912
