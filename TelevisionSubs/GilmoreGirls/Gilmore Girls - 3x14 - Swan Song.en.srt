1
00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:04,796
And then she just brushed me off with a wave of her regal hand.

2
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:08,467
Not even a word, just a... like I�m her cabana boy.

3
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:11,032
Next thing you know, instead of just walking out of the room,

4
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,712
she�ll make me bow and back out.

5
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,502
Imperious attitude, she never gives it a rest.

6
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:17,499
I schlepped her to the doctor the other day

7
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,291
- by command, not request �

8
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:22,588
and the elevator operator there greeted us nice and friendly.

9
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,778
Her doctor�s on the second floor and by the time we got there,

10
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:27,580
that operator was in tears.

11
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:31,441
What?

12
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:34,359
Mom, you just did twenty straight minutes on Gran.

13
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,475
It wasn�t twenty minutes.

14
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:36,556
It was getting there.

15
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:39,101
How about a moratorium on the Gran stories for a bit?

16
00:00:39,188 --> 00:00:41,998
Fine. I�d rather not spoil the meal with talk of her.

17
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:42,756
Good.

18
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:44,077
I should just wash my hands.

19
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:46,698
We�ll wait.

20
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:47,824
I mean of her.

21
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,361
Oh, good, wash those hands.

22
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:51,062
She sucks her olive pits.

23
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:52,075
Short moratorium.

24
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:55,822
Trying to extract every last ounce of flavor out of them like she does people.

25
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:57,696
She sucks flavor out of people?

26
00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:58,895
Can we change the subject?

27
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:00,112
Life, not flavor.

28
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,377
Hey, you know what Gran needs?

29
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:02,976
- What? 
- A fella.

30
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:04,296
With or without an umbrella.

31
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:06,662
He�d have to look like an olive pit to get her attention.

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,758
It�s like a Dean Martin Roast.

33
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:08,935
Those are never funny to me.

34
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:10,025
Yeah, they�re mean.

35
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:12,359
- Except for Don Rickles. 
- Totally except for Rickles.

36
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:16,560
I think she did have a man for a time squiring her around to her biddy affairs.

37
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:18,766
Richard thought so, too, and it horrified him.

38
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,205
Didn�t want a new Daddy, huh?

39
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,345
And then he seemed suddenly out of the picture.

40
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:23,926
So Great Grandma never talked about him?

41
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:24,607
Never.

42
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,484
Even though I could tell practically the day she stopped seeing him.

43
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:29,783
Those kinds of things are always obvious.

44
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:31,019
Yeah, I guess.

45
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:34,115
When a couple is in a relationship and then suddenly isn�t.

46
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:34,883
Right.

47
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:35,693
Right.

48
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:38,570
Is she still looking?

49
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:39,793
Yup.

50
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,723
Right. You know, Grandma,

51
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:46,087
did I mention that unfortunately I�m not with Dean anymore?

52
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:48,180
- No, you didn�t. 
- Well, I�m not.

53
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:50,618
Well, yes, I�ve known for weeks actually.

54
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:52,390
But it�s good that you confirmed it.

55
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:53,254
How did you know?

56
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:56,141
You very abruptly stopped mentioning him eleven dinners ago,

57
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:57,381
so I figured that was the case.

58
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,943
Eleven dinners, you kept count?

59
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,315
- Eleven. 
- Eleven.

60
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:02,188
I�m sorry I didn�t tell you Grandma.

61
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,540
I think you should have.

62
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:06,136
I mean, what if I had invited Dean to an event

63
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:08,809
and you were no longer with him, and that�s how I found out?

64
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:09,951
It would�ve been embarrassing.

65
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,963
What sort of event would you have invited Dean to?

66
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:13,473
I don�t know, a wedding.

67
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:14,329
For who?

68
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:15,941
A mutual friend or something.

69
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,793
You and Dean have mutual friends in common that Rory and I don�t?

70
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:22,475
Who would that be, the Talbotts or that senior partner at Deloite and Touche?

71
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:23,565
You know what I meant.

72
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:26,534
It�s always best to tell each other major life events

73
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:27,999
so that there�s no awkwardness.

74
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:30,620
Then, Grandma, I probably also failed to mention

75
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:31,605
that I�m seeing someone else.

76
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,680
- Who? 
- Jess.

77
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,626
- Jess? 
- Luke�s nephew.

78
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:35,981
Luke from the diner.

79
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:38,803
Oh, I see.

80
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:41,772
Well, am I going to get to meet him soon?

81
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,345
Oh, I don�t know.

82
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,075
Yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange.

83
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,314
How hard can it be?

84
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,710
Just bring him over for dinner sometime. How about next Friday?

85
00:02:48,956 --> 00:02:50,129
Oh, I don�t know.

86
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:52,863
Yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange.

87
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,051
It�s perfect timing.

88
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,807
Richard will still be out of town

89
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:58,434
and it would be nice to round off the group with a fourth.

90
00:02:58,598 --> 00:02:59,769
He works Fridays, doesn�t he?

91
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:02,186
Yeah, that�s his usual night. Friday night. It�s a bad night.

92
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:03,677
Oh, okay.

93
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:07,025
I suppose I�ll eventually meet him someday at some function.

94
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:08,084
Perhaps a wedding.

95
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,426
Or Rory�s graduation.

96
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:11,459
That�s good.

97
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:14,198
That way we�ll all get to meet him at once.

98
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:16,199
Myself, Richard, Gran.

99
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:19,139
Maybe I�ll bring a couple of girls from the DAR.

100
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,510
Reverend Mahoney might like to come also.

101
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,696
You know what, Grandma, now that I think about it,

102
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,929
I think Jess does have next Friday night off.

103
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:26,905
Really?

104
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:28,416
Let�s make it a foursome.

105
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,624
That�ll be nice.

106
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:31,487
Yeah, it will be nice, right Grandma?

107
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:33,117
Very nice. We�ll have lamb.

108
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:35,222
So, it will be nice for everybody?

109
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,831
Everybody will be nice to everybody?

110
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:40,428
- The key word being nice. 
- Yes, very nice.

111
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:42,220
Really, really nice?

112
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:44,325
Of course it�ll be nice. That�s what I just said.

113
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,352
Good. Nice would be nice.

114
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:47,893
And a nice night it�ll be.

115
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,279
Well, not so nice for the lamb.

116
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,434
Okay, Saturday morning I�ve got hair appointment, nails, and Jim.

117
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:55,673
You don�t go to the gym.

118
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,208
No, Jim is coming here to fix the garbage disposal.

119
00:04:58,305 --> 00:04:59,278
Jim Dunning, got it.

120
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,258
- I also have resha plebisham. 
- What?

121
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,632
I don�t know, I can�t read it.

122
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:05,277
Shouldn�t you change your system, go electronic or something?

123
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:08,238
- You�re a busy woman. 
- Hey, my system works.

124
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,244
Yeah, tell that to the guy who calls tomorrow

125
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:11,735
because you missed your resha plebisham appointment.

126
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:14,094
I hate that we have to coordinate schedules. You�re my daughter.

127
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:15,713
But if we don�t, we may never see each other.

128
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,122
We didn�t use to have to do this.

129
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,201
We�re busier now.

130
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,230
Let�s just run away together and leave all this behind.

131
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,360
You mean our house?

132
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,526
No, we�ll take the house, we�ll leave everything else.

133
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:24,309
Put it on your list.

134
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,722
So what�s your day like tomorrow?

135
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:28,110
Hanging out with Jess for most of the day, studying at night.

136
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:30,536
Cool. Alex and I are having dinner tomorrow night.

137
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,872
Good. That�ll make it nice and quiet for when I study.

138
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,986
I�m that loud?

139
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,096
You are when you dance around singing �Rory�s Studying� songs.

140
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:40,269
Oh, what�s this I have down for Sunday � slatha bang trafficking?

141
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:41,304
Lane�s band practicing.

142
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:43,059
And underneath it � net fracks?

143
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,045
- Get snacks. 
- Right, for the band.

144
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:46,444
See, see, it works.

145
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,951
So, you�re actually bringing Jess to dinner on Friday?

146
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,781
It�s as good a time as any. There�ll only be one grandparent to contend with.

147
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:56,755
Man, that was some stealthy little maneuver she pulled there, huh?

148
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,377
Applying the guilt over not knowing about the Dean breakup

149
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,483
and making you all weak,

150
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:03,243
and then using that to get Jess to come to dinner on Friday.

151
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,151
She�s like Lyndon Johnson with the Senate, effortless.

152
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:07,994
So, Sunday�s for us, right?

153
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:10,534
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have you down right here �

154
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,397
Cokie.

155
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:14,159
Good. Hey, it�s still early.

156
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,986
Do you wanna watch more of the extra supplementary stuff

157
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,143
on the Lord of the Rings DVD?

158
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,668
It�s just the drawings and that fat guy talking.

159
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,681
- Let�s watch Footloose again. 
- Yeah.

160
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:24,757
Hey, you dropped some of your notes.

161
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,297
Oh, who cares? You can�t read �em anyway.

162
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,202
- Do you love it? 
- It�s great.

163
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:31,105
The Holy Barbarians. I mean, what a title.

164
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:34,398
And it�s by a Venice Beach beatnik about Venice Beach beatniks,

165
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:37,142
and to top it off, the beatnik who wrote it is the father of the guy

166
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,025
that does those Actor�s Studio interviews on TV.

167
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:41,919
- The guy with the beard? 
- Yeah, the pointy beard.

168
00:06:42,662 --> 00:06:44,223
That�s his dad writing at his desk.

169
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:47,475
Oh, it�s weird that a weird beatnik-y guy would have a conservative son like that.

170
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:48,754
Maybe he�s not that conservative.

171
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,663
Maybe at night, he, like, takes off his clothes and parties.

172
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,732
Aw, man, now get that picture out of my head.

173
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:55,606
It�s a cool book, you�ve gotta admit.

174
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:56,988
It is. Thanks.

175
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,071
Oh, I�m not lending it. I�m not done.

176
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:00,418
Why�d you show it to me?

177
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:01,945
I like showing you the stuff I�m reading.

178
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:03,269
But you knew I�d wanna read it.

179
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:05,150
- You�re a book tease. 
- You�ll get it when I�m done.

180
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,152
Cruel woman.

181
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,734
So, are you going to work now?

182
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:10,188
Back to the salt mines.

183
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:12,911
So, you�re not tied to the hours you have, right?

184
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:14,044
You can trade if you want to.

185
00:07:14,462 --> 00:07:15,580
There�s some flexibility.

186
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:17,364
You got any flexibility next Friday night?

187
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,210
Yeah, why?

188
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:19,977
I thought maybe you could come to dinner with us.

189
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:21,446
- Us? 
- To my Grandma�s.

190
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,870
To meet your grandmother.

191
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:24,927
Yeah, she�ll be there, so yeah,

192
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:27,447
it might be rude not to introduce the two of you.

193
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,600
I can�t, I gotta work.

194
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:29,782
You just said you could get out.

195
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:30,709
I didn�t know what for.

196
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,009
- Jess. 
- No.

197
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:34,687
- But I already kind of agreed. 
- Aw, man.

198
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,070
So I�m kinda jammed here.

199
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,826
- Does she know what I look like? 
- I don�t think so.

200
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,037
Perfect. Find someone who vaguely resembles me.

201
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,506
Take him. Just don�t kiss him goodnight.

202
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,639
That�s not going to work.

203
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,194
Andy Warhol did it all the time.

204
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,936
We�re just five bucks away from a deal.

205
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,235
That�s worth five at least.

206
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:59,017
You Gilmores think a lot of yourselves.

207
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:01,941
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

208
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,136
Manipulator.

209
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:08,761
- Rory, get in here. 
- What?

210
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:10,333
Get in here now. No questions.

211
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:19,262
Okay, now, for those who just arrived,

212
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,929
I�m trying out some material for my one-woman show

213
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:23,450
and I need some feedback.

214
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,172
You are my randomly picked audience.

215
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,581
Randomly shang-hai�ed.

216
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:31,775
It�s part stories, part songs.

217
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:35,498
Kind of like what Elaine Stritch did on Broadway, but without the bitterness.

218
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,428
My working title �

219
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,433
"Buckle Up, I�m Patty."

220
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:41,601
How long have you been here?

221
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,755
- An hour. 
- Poor thing.

222
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,207
It�s been mostly her and Kirk arguing about stuff.

223
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:49,117
Apparently, he�s the director.

224
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,132
Patty, let�s try one of your reminisces.

225
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,227
That�s what I�m looking for, Kirk.

226
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:56,035
Sorry I didn�t save you. I didn�t see you until it was too late.

227
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,646
I don�t think anybody could�ve saved me.

228
00:08:57,795 --> 00:08:58,829
Okay, here we go.

229
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:00,279
Hey,

230
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:05,737
did you know that I once met the great Bette Davis?

231
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:10,201
I was a chorus girl in a bus-and-truck tour of "Guys and Dolls."

232
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,611
Beantown, I love that town.

233
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:16,581
And there I was, me and the girls backstage after the show,

234
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,915
and in she comes.

235
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:21,543
And who does she walk right up to,

236
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:23,292
but little old me.

237
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:26,642
And she sized me up,

238
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,904
exhaled some smoke from that regal mouth of hers, and said,

239
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:36,289
"Doll, you don�t got the high notes but you sure got the gams."

240
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:42,109
I�ll always treasure that moment with Bette and I wanna dedicate this song to her.

241
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:44,116
Ethel, key a D.

242
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:45,387
We�re gonna have to rewrite that.

243
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,144
What?

244
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:48,156
It got no response. It needs a rewrite.

245
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:51,550
Kirk, it�s my reminiscence. I can�t rewrite it.

246
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:55,376
How about if she says, "Doll, you�ve got the gams,

247
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,864
but I�ve got a body in the trunk of my car."

248
00:09:58,008 --> 00:09:59,102
Why would she say that?

249
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:01,258
Because she�s a murderer. I think it works.

250
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,587
I�m not rewriting my memories, Kirk.

251
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:06,670
It died. Build a coffin for it, put some pennies on its eyes

252
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,012
�cause that stiff ain�t breathing.

253
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:09,840
I think that we should discuss this later,

254
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,309
now go back to your light booth.

255
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:12,419
Fine, start the song.

256
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,801
It�s a quarter of three,

257
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:25,302
there is no one in the place,

258
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,270
except you and me.

259
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:31,533
Kirk, would you fix this?

260
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:32,330
Fix what?

261
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:33,797
This flashing.

262
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,500
That�s my choice for the song.

263
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:36,899
It�s disco.

264
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,013
I�m trying to subvert expectations.

265
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,435
Well, don�t. Just give me a simple spot.

266
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:43,314
Something more obvious, got it.

267
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:45,618
- This is a hit. 
- It�ll run for years.

268
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:47,794
Something on the nose and expected, got it.

269
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:48,726
Kirk!

270
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:50,682
It was nice of you to step in like that.

271
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:52,514
Well, she could�ve hurt herself

272
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:54,107
trying to throw the podium at him like that.

273
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,360
I think "work in progress" is the key phrase.

274
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:57,717
I like that she tries.

275
00:10:57,912 --> 00:10:59,678
The woman taught me everything I�ve already forgotten

276
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,048
about dancing, baton twirling and gymnastics.

277
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:04,271
- Well, I�m this way. 
- I�m this way.

278
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,032
- See you later. 
- See ya.

279
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:06,999
You know,

280
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:09,074
I kind of liked the body in the trunk thing.

281
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:10,522
Me, too. Peppier.

282
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:11,612
- Night. 
- Night.

283
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,050
Oh, sorry.

284
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,249
- It�s okay. 
- It�s okay.

285
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:34,162
I can just shut the door so you can carry on.

286
00:11:34,356 --> 00:11:35,973
No, we�ve carried on enough.

287
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,458
Yeah, I think we�ve carried on pretty good out here.

288
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,697
- I�ll call you about the weekend. 
- Okay.

289
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,783
- Bye Rory. 
- Goodnight.

290
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,115
We need a signal.

291
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,504
A kissing signal?

292
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:45,952
Something to avoid this.

293
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:48,507
Okay, how �bout I shoot off a flare

294
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,463
- when I�m outside necking with a boy? 
- You know what I mean.

295
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,021
Or I could bang on the door

296
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:53,858
and yell, "Hey, we�re necking out here!"

297
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:55,091
I still say we need a signal.

298
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:56,157
We�ll think of something.

299
00:11:56,444 --> 00:12:00,130
Listen. Alex and I were talking about going to New York next weekend.

300
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:01,379
- Fun. 
- Yeah.

301
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:03,391
He�s got four tickets to a show and he�s heard me

302
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:06,387
talk about Sookie and Jackson so much that he wants to invite them, too.

303
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,975
It�s not "Buckle Up, I�m Patty," is it?

304
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:09,029
- Huh? 
- Nothing.

305
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:11,702
- We�d have to leave Friday day. 
- So?

306
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:14,936
Meaning it�s just you and Jess alone

307
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,884
at dinner with the glorious Emily.

308
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, that�s totally fine.

309
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:18,671
Are you sure?

310
00:12:18,803 --> 00:12:20,325
Yeah, it might even make things easier.

311
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:21,334
What does that mean?

312
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:25,153
Nothing. Just, it might make it less pressure-packed.

313
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,591
So I�m loud when you study

314
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,260
and make social gatherings worse?

315
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:29,740
Out of the goodness of your heart,

316
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:31,450
you would be trying to shield me all night,

317
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,417
and that might makes things worse.

318
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,462
Out of love. And I love you, I hope you know that.

319
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,191
Okay, I think I get it. I have the best intentions.

320
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:39,955
Bingo.

321
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,267
- Hello? 
- Hey.

322
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:44,865
Hey. How was work?

323
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:46,845
I toted the barge, lifted the bale.

324
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:48,905
You�re a great barge toter, I can attest to that.

325
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:50,067
How was your day?

326
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,022
Fine. A lot of studying.

327
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:53,768
Oh yeah? Is that all you did?

328
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:55,483
- Yeah, basically. 
- Basically?

329
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:56,543
Jess, what?

330
00:12:56,697 --> 00:12:58,509
I heard that you were basically hanging out with Dean today.

331
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,785
Where did you hear that?

332
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:00,962
It�s all over town.

333
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,465
Well, I was with him for awhile.

334
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:04,976
What do you mean, it�s all over town?

335
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:06,173
You haven�t seen the fliers?

336
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:08,115
I�ve been home all night. What fliers?

337
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:12,616
It says, "People are already raving about Miss Patty�s one woman show."

338
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:14,577
- And? 
- There�s some blurbs.

339
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:17,623
One says, "Rory and Dean couldn�t stop talking about it."

340
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:18,667
We�re on a flier?

341
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:19,900
You and a bunch of others.

342
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:23,680
"The mailman says, even without proper postage, this show delivers."

343
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:26,076
Now she�s making that up �cause Ralph�s not that witty.

344
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:27,438
Were you hanging out there with Dean?

345
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,624
I was not hanging out with Dean.

346
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:32,343
We were both hauled in there to watch her try out material

347
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,750
and we were sitting in the same area so we talked a little,

348
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:36,172
and then we left at the same time.

349
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,370
That was it. It was all by accident.

350
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:42,035
This is an old subject, Jess. You know that Dean and I are friendly.

351
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:44,323
I know you�re friendly. That doesn�t mean I don�t wanna punch him.

352
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,604
This was not a plan.

353
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:49,316
I was kidnapped by Miss Patty, so was he, that�s it.

354
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,082
Then you two should press charges.

355
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,085
I think we should.

356
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:53,397
Just...

357
00:13:53,923 --> 00:13:54,430
What?

358
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:57,488
Just tell me these things first

359
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,397
so I don�t have to read about them on telephone poles.

360
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,994
- I will, I promise. 
- Okay.

361
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:02,233
Okay.

362
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,565
So, how was the show?

363
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,464
It�s gonna need a lot of postage.

364
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:08,981
Why does it say, "Not in any way affiliated with Kirk" down at the bottom?

365
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,406
They had a showbiz spat.

366
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:11,618
Fill me in.

367
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:15,623
Help yourselves to drinks in the fridge, guys.

368
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:17,707
We�ve got chips, pretzels, and Brian,

369
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:19,853
I remembered your allergies and got you the melba toast.

370
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:20,887
That�s nice, thanks.

371
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:22,085
We got a lot done today.

372
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,263
We�ve almost got a full set.

373
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:25,649
But you know what we�re missing? A straight-ahead love song.

374
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,902
Yeah, all our songs are pretty much about property destruction

375
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:29,791
and a general dislike of right-wing causes.

376
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:31,143
Not one love song, huh?

377
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,985
I think we can add one or two, that are good ones.

378
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:36,083
Boy, you�d think love songs are all you and Lane would wanna play.

379
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,577
Man, this crunch just now sounded like the drum-fill in Baba O�Reilly.

380
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:42,648
Cool, way to go Zach.

381
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:44,050
Yeah, Zach, a musical mouth.

382
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,242
That�s awesome.

383
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,910
But why would Dave and Lane wanna play just love songs?

384
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:51,505
Because, I was just thinking, you know, with Dave�s name �

385
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,368
Dave � you�ve got the last two letters in love.

386
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:56,768
V, E. And with Lane�s name, you have the L.

387
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:59,153
You can just dump the A and add an O and there you go.

388
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,563
Makes sense.

389
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:01,432
Totally.

390
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:04,121
We should probably start breaking stuff down. I gotta get home for dinner.

391
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,204
One day soon, you�re not gonna go home from dinner.

392
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:08,217
- What, I�ll be dead? 
- No, we�ll be on tour.

393
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,818
Right, right.

394
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,442
That was a negative "right, right," man.

395
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,976
Guys, I�m so sorry. It just slipped out.

396
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,754
That�s okay.

397
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,120
Luckily Zach and Brian are...

398
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,754
well, Zach and Brian.

399
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:23,335
How long are you gonna keep it a secret?

400
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:24,549
For awhile, at least. It�s easier.

401
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:26,555
Are you sure it would be so bad if they knew?

402
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:29,071
I mean, keeping this a secret seems awfully complicated.

403
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:30,120
Not really, we�ve got a system.

404
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:33,120
Speaking of which, it�s 3:18.

405
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:35,250
We�ll have the stuff packed by 3:40, what�s the situation?

406
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:38,245
At 3:40, my mom will be on her way to the yarn store

407
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:41,164
for her bimonthly sew-a-thon with Lacey Schwartz and Bick Ho.

408
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:42,607
- The yarn store�s on Peach. 
- Plum.

409
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,912
That cuts us off from our usually route to the interstate.

410
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,464
There�s a back road that circles around it,

411
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:47,897
but it�s gonna be muddy from the rains.

412
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:49,904
How about I have the guys take the usual route,

413
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:52,735
I�ll go by foot on Peach, down the alley behind Al�s, over the fence,

414
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:54,855
and they can pick me up a half a mile down by the Shell station.

415
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:55,653
Perfect.

416
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:00,225
What, that�s not complicated.

417
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:01,689
Sorry I doubted you.

418
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:02,726
Okay, then.

419
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:10,646
- Coffee? 
- Please, and hurry.

420
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:13,804
I am going to Manhattan this weekend and I need to shop for some warm clothes.

421
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,141
You already have warm clothes.

422
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:16,190
I have nothing.

423
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,781
We�re in Connecticut. It gets freezing here same as in New York.

424
00:16:18,863 --> 00:16:20,583
- No, it�s not the same. 
- Exactly the same.

425
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,226
I have nothing stylish enough.

426
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,978
That�s not true, you got the black cashmere coat.

427
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:25,370
- But it needs cleaning. 
- So clean it.

428
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:26,691
But I need some sweaters, too.

429
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,760
You�ve got the purple, you�ve got the powder blue,

430
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:30,757
you�ve got three shades of red, you�ve got a ton of black,

431
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,186
all of which will go with that coat.

432
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:35,929
Plus, you�ve got a dozen scarves to mix and match with any of those tops.

433
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:37,454
Let me shop for some clothes.

434
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,523
Okay. So what are you doing in New York?

435
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,496
Oh, a bunch of us are going. It�ll be dinner and a show.

436
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:44,428
Oh, what show?

437
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,630
Levittown, it�s a new musical.

438
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,637
Right, yeah. It�s in previews, doesn�t officially open for a couple weeks.

439
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,946
- Wow, so informed. 
- Nicole likes the theater.

440
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:53,869
Her firm has an office on Madison. I�ve met her there a couple times.

441
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,298
Saw Hairspray last week.

442
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,059
I cannot picture you watching Hairspray.

443
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:58,573
It was okay. I liked The Producers better.

444
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:00,453
Aren�t we just a Broadway baby.

445
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:02,261
- Gonna have any time to kill there? 
- Some.

446
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:05,461
Got a great book, it has walking tours of old historic Manhattan.

447
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:07,960
You know, before Disney got a hold of it. The Soho one�s pretty good.

448
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:09,203
Oh, I love stuff like that.

449
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:11,281
It�s upstairs on my dresser if you wanna run up and grab it.

450
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,419
Cool, thanks.

451
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:19,028
Mom!

452
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:19,919
Surprise.

453
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:21,143
What are you doing here?

454
00:17:21,302 --> 00:17:22,239
I came up for a book.

455
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:23,469
- A book? 
- Yeah.

456
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,219
Got a lot of books here. Anything in particular?

457
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:26,397
It�s one of Luke�s.

458
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:29,423
If it doesn�t have Encyclopedia Brown in the title, that narrows it down a lot.

459
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:30,723
Walking tours, New York.

460
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:32,038
On the table.

461
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:35,992
Good, here it is, okay, so, thanks.

462
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,328
- Sorry about this. 
- It�s okay.

463
00:17:37,718 --> 00:17:40,194
We should probably come up with a system or something.

464
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:41,675
- Probably. 
- D�j� vu, huh?

465
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:42,401
D�j� vu.

466
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,767
Although, why I�d be walking into Luke�s apartment like this in the future,

467
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,004
I don�t know, so put the system on the back burner.

468
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:48,428
- Okay. 
- Mmkay.

469
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,112
Carry on, or... see ya.

470
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:58,130
- Dude! 
- Hey. Find it okay?

471
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,158
Yeah. I found everything -- including a couple coupling.

472
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,064
Oh, Rory and Jess?

473
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,749
No, Ben and J. Lo. Yes, Rory and Jess.

474
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:03,900
I guess I should�ve told you.

475
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,001
You knew they were up there?

476
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,948
They�re up there all the time.

477
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:07,581
On the couch...

478
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,375
horizontal, on the couch?

479
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,054
They come up for air every so often.

480
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:13,245
And you just allow this? Luke!

481
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,131
Settle down.

482
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:16,311
I go up there every ten minutes pretending to get something

483
00:18:16,397 --> 00:18:18,519
to keep them from doing something we don�t want.

484
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:21,621
"Oops, I forgot my pocketknife." "Oops, I�m out of ones."

485
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:26,193
"Hey, you see a case of mustard up here?" I put the stuff in a box.

486
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:30,346
I take the box upstairs every couple days and start all over again.

487
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:32,194
And you think that suffices?

488
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,123
Look, it�s better that they�re safe and upstairs than someplace else.

489
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,851
And you going up there just now saved me a trip, so thanks.

490
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:39,055
Glad to be of service.

491
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:40,442
I got a good system, it works.

492
00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:41,882
Every ten minutes?

493
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:43,438
Like clockwork, never a minute more.

494
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:45,783
Even if you�re serving a customer, it�s every ten minutes?

495
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:47,447
If I�m in mid-pour, I stop and go up.

496
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:48,962
Ten minutes.

497
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,788
Yeah, that�s pretty much the time it took to create Rory.

498
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,161
And that included getting dressed and freshening my lipstick.

499
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:56,909
What?

500
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:57,893
Thanks for the book.

501
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:00,272
Caesar, cover for me.

502
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:05,275
- Rory? 
- I�m coming.

503
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:07,881
Toute de suite, and I don�t mean the candy.

504
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,338
Okay, what�s the packing crisis?

505
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,182
That�s the thing.

506
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,044
I have no packing crisis.

507
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,522
For the first time in my life, there is no packing crisis. See?

508
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:19,837
This has never happened to me before.

509
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,728
I�m all packed, ready to go, and fully confident that I have everything I�ll need or desire.

510
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,232
So you�re creating a crisis out of nostalgia?

511
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,397
No, see, Alex and I talked about everything we plan to do

512
00:19:29,498 --> 00:19:31,772
and how he expected to dress and how I expected to dress,

513
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:35,679
and we coordinated to the point where I knew each piece of clothing I had to bring,

514
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,684
down to the Spice Girls necklace I plan to wear Saturday morning for breakfast

515
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,231
because we agreed to keep it a little whimsical.

516
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:41,776
So, not your Jonas Salk necklace?

517
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:43,947
I�m trying to become as good a planner as you.

518
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:44,875
So, what�s the problem?

519
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,962
I have no idea what to wear on the drive.

520
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:49,318
I wanna look good, obviously,

521
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,620
but not too good that it steps on my night outfit, and I also wanna be comfortable.

522
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:53,937
What�s he wearing, a jogging suit?

523
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,147
Yeah, and then after, he and Paulie are hitting the Bada Bing.

524
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,303
Your point being, it�s probably not a running suit.

525
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:00,895
- Right. 
- And tonight�s a dress?

526
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,860
And, my cashmere coat and a hat.

527
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,554
Your stretchy jeans and your Bunnyranch T-shirt.

528
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:07,643
Comfort and raunch, I love it.

529
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:08,764
Good.

530
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,691
So, how are you guys working the logistics tonight?

531
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:14,714
I am going to study at school,

532
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,316
then I�m going straight to Grandma�s from there.

533
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:19,260
Jess is driving straight from work, and then he�s driving me home.

534
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:20,709
Home? Home here?

535
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:21,754
Yeah, he�s gonna drop me off here.

536
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,140
I guess that makes sense.

537
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:25,000
I thought so.

538
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,835
Although, I don�t know.

539
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:29,105
What?

540
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:30,708
Are you sure that�s the best way to do it?

541
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:31,799
Yeah, why?

542
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:34,604
It just means you�re coming home to an empty house.

543
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:35,890
That�s your doing, not mine.

544
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:37,303
Yeah, but it might be kind of lonely here.

545
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:38,757
Did you think about staying at Mom�s?

546
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:39,929
- Overnight? 
- Yeah.

547
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:42,388
They�ve got those fancy beds that don�t sag,

548
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:46,187
and you�re guaranteed a great Norma Desmond style breakfast the next morning.

549
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,179
You don�t have school, it works out perfectly.

550
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:49,473
I�d rather just come home.

551
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:51,133
Okay, sure.

552
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:54,983
But, you know, staying at your grandmother�s would also mean

553
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,576
that Jess wouldn�t have to go out of his way at the end of the night to drop you off.

554
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:00,574
It would be much more convenient for him.

555
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:03,140
Our house is two-tenths of a mile out of his way.

556
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:04,527
Are you sure he�s gonna have enough gas?

557
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:05,582
I�ll make sure.

558
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:07,081
But if you can�t get a hold of him,

559
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:08,944
it might be safer to plan on staying at Mom�s.

560
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,438
I mean, if you run out of gas, you�re stuck. And at the mercy of the Orcs.

561
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:13,942
Mom, why are you so freaked?

562
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:15,361
This is not freaked.

563
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,132
Is it because you won�t be here and he will?

564
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:18,802
It might�ve crossed my mind.

565
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,541
And what are you worried about happening?

566
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,788
What you guys were on the on-ramp for up at Luke�s the other day.

567
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,697
Your basic boy/girl stuff.

568
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:27,921
Especially with this new boy, you girl stuff.

569
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:30,777
The boy is different, but I�m still me. That hasn�t changed.

570
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:31,729
Yeah, I know.

571
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:34,434
And I have so much on my mind, so many things going on in my life,

572
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:37,899
that I don�t ever have time to think about that.

573
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:39,338
No thinking at all?

574
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:40,402
None, I swear.

575
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:41,585
Mmm, sure, sure.

576
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:44,053
And we talk about everything together, you and me, remember?

577
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:46,475
So it�s not like something will happen that you won�t know about.

578
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:47,616
Good.

579
00:21:49,604 --> 00:21:51,234
That�s Alex. Come on.

580
00:21:55,155 --> 00:21:56,752
You know, you didn�t have to change.

581
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:59,754
I feel kind of dumb being in my uniform when I�m not in school.

582
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:01,376
But you look darling in it.

583
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:03,102
I�m going to miss it when you go to college.

584
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:05,047
Yeah, I am, too, in a way.

585
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:07,248
I mean, I like not having to think about what I�m going to wear.

586
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:09,901
And you�ll have plenty of years to stress yourself out about that.

587
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:13,132
I�m sorry he�s late.

588
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:14,949
We�re fine. Dinner will keep.

589
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:16,737
I know how you like things to be punctual.

590
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:19,655
There was a big tie-up on the 84 earlier.

591
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:21,857
He�s probably smack dab in the middle of that.

592
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:24,494
Why don�t you try him on his cell phone, see what�s going on.

593
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,497
He doesn�t have one.

594
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:27,662
- Really? 
- He doesn�t believe in them.

595
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,289
Well, I find that refreshing.

596
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:34,458
Technology is encroaching too fast on every aspect of life, if you ask me.

597
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:37,945
It�s getting to the point where people will want robots to carry them from place to place.

598
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:40,152
There he is.

599
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,057
- What... 
- Sorry I�m late.

600
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,536
Oh, that�s all right. Come in, come in. It�s cold out.

601
00:22:52,592 --> 00:22:53,848
Grandma, this is Jess.

602
00:22:54,277 --> 00:22:55,399
Jess, my grandmother.

603
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:57,083
- Nice to meet you. 
- Same here.

604
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:58,159
What happened to your eye?

605
00:22:58,283 --> 00:22:59,705
It�s a long story, I don�t wanna bore you.

606
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,210
- Oh, this is new? 
- Brand new.

607
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:02,531
It looks bad. Does it hurt?

608
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,395
- I�m fine. 
- Is it why you were late?

609
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:07,175
- No, 84 was jammed. 
- We knew that, too.

610
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:08,624
There was something with a big rig.

611
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,570
Oh, those things, they scare the life out of me.

612
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:14,528
And apparently, all the men who drive them are hopped up on bennies and goofballs.

613
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:17,537
Come, come, have a seat at the table. I�ll go check on dinner.

614
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,101
- Shouldn�t we go with her? 
- Were you in a fight?

615
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:22,807
- Dinner�s waiting. 
- Jess, were you in a fight?

616
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,716
I told you, it�s a long story, I don�t wanna talk about it.

617
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:25,432
Why?

618
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:27,926
Look, Rory, I�m already in a crappy mood.

619
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:31,412
Traffic sucked. Traffic I hit going to a function I didn�t particularly wanna go to.

620
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:33,508
And I�m thirsty. And I�m hungry.

621
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,489
So let�s eat.

622
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,112
- So do we eat standing up? 
- Over there.

623
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:46,610
The roast looks perfect.

624
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:48,873
Oh, Jess, you eat meat, I hope. I forgot to ask.

625
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:49,846
I�m a carnivore.

626
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:53,204
Good. I don�t see how anybody can resist eating meat.

627
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:54,468
It�s why we have teeth.

628
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:55,496
That�s how I feel.

629
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:57,658
Dinner parties used to be simple.

630
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:01,944
Now every time we give one, I have to run my menu down with every person on the list.

631
00:24:02,062 --> 00:24:02,804
It�s tiring.

632
00:24:03,337 --> 00:24:05,497
- This one eats just about anything. 
- Grandma.

633
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:07,581
I�m sorry, but the way you and your mother eat,

634
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:10,018
and those slim figures of yours � it�s a medical marvel.

635
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:12,250
- They should be studied. 
- I don�t think so.

636
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,860
So, Rory tells me you�re part of the Wal-Mart corporation.

637
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:17,130
Only out of necessity.

638
00:24:17,263 --> 00:24:18,783
They sound like wonderful stores.

639
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,361
Oh, yeah, I wanna be buried there.

640
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,161
We�ve never actually been inside one, but we own the stock.

641
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:24,246
Thanks for the paycheck.

642
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,227
Oh, that�s very funny.

643
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,220
Did you just get it?

644
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:30,033
The eye � did it just happen?

645
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:33,197
You know, we should eat these salads so the roast doesn�t get cold.

646
00:24:33,335 --> 00:24:36,510
I mean, it must be sometime between nine last night and now.

647
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:37,952
His eye.

648
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:39,633
Yeah, it was sometime in there.

649
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:40,862
But you can�t narrow it down?

650
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:41,916
Rory, come on.

651
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,734
Oh my God, there�s no salt and pepper on this table.

652
00:24:43,903 --> 00:24:45,024
We�ll need it for the meat.

653
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:47,323
These people are supposed to be trained before I get them,

654
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,001
but God knows that�s never the case.

655
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,656
What is your problem?

656
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:55,392
You�re not telling me the truth, that�s my problem.

657
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,995
I don�t wanna get into it here.

658
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:59,064
- And it�s obvious why. 
- Oh, is it?

659
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,451
You got into a fight with Dean.

660
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,176
- Unbelievable. 
- Is that it?

661
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:04,102
It always comes back to Dean.

662
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:06,717
- Because you bring it there. 
- You brought up Dean.

663
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:08,090
Because you got into a fight with him.

664
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:10,562
Why are you pressing this? Why?

665
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:12,939
I�m trying to make some kind of quasi-positive impression

666
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:16,937
on your grandmother per your request and you�re forcing me to do otherwise.

667
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:20,143
And what the hell are raisins doing in a salad?

668
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:21,868
Why can�t people leave well enough alone?

669
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,916
In that whole speech, I didn�t hear you deny it.

670
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:26,050
We�ve got great choices on the prime rib.

671
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:27,557
How do you like your prime rib, Jess?

672
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,436
- Cooked. 
- He�s not picky, Grandma.

673
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:31,713
Good, that�ll make it easier.

674
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:33,993
So, what did I miss?

675
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:35,867
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

676
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:38,529
Grandma, would it be all right if I speak to Jess for a second?

677
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,311
- We can go to the study. 
- We�re eating.

678
00:25:40,475 --> 00:25:41,637
Well, I want to talk.

679
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:43,839
You�re being a little rude to your grandmother, Rory.

680
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,543
I can leave the room for a minute if you want.

681
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:47,156
No, Grandma, we�ll be right back.

682
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:55,906
I told you nothing happened at Patty�s, but you just wouldn�t believe it.

683
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,003
You had to get into a fight with Dean tonight right before meeting my grandmother.

684
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,501
- This is a disaster. 
- I did not get into a fight with Dean.

685
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,968
- Bull. 
- Believe what you want.

686
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:05,301
I�m going to find out eventually, so why keep it from me?

687
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:07,872
What if Dean had sucker-punched me and I had to defend myself?

688
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,699
You�re not even considering the possibility that that�s what happened?

689
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:11,784
Dean wouldn�t do that.

690
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:14,323
Oh, no, he might get his big white Stetson dirty.

691
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:15,796
You�re being a jerk to my grandmother, too.

692
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,853
Hey, I�m doing my best.

693
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,608
If that means I�m being a jerk, then that�s what I am.

694
00:26:18,783 --> 00:26:20,780
- I didn�t even wanna come. 
- No one made you.

695
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:21,897
You made me.

696
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,604
Now I�ve seen it all.

697
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,825
You embarrassed me in front of her.

698
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:30,768
- That�s it, I�ve had it. 
- So have I.

699
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:32,233
If you�re gonna harp on this, I�m leaving.

700
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:34,307
Oh, great, so now I have to explain to my Grandma

701
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:37,984
why my boyfriend who showed up a half-hour late with a black eye is walking out.

702
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:40,957
You like making up stories in your head so that should be easy for you.

703
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:51,879
Is he fetching something from his car?

704
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,267
I don�t think so.

705
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:57,337
He left.

706
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,089
Yeah, he left.

707
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:03,195
Well, you can take some prime rib back for him if you want.

708
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:06,277
What do you say the girls have some dinner, huh?

709
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:19,339
So, good, good show.

710
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:21,791
Yeah, yeah. Alex, thank you for getting us those tickets.

711
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,445
Great production value.

712
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:26,000
Oh, amazing. I mean, the way they do lighting on these things.

713
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:27,879
It�s magical, it�s magical.

714
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:29,717
This is the worst piece of crap I�ve ever seen.

715
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:30,802
What?

716
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,927
I saw Moose Murders. This stinks worse.

717
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:35,640
- I thought it was me. 
- I was dying in there.

718
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:37,550
- Every song is the same. 
- The same two notes.

719
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:39,998
- How does that happen? 
- I feel so very bad.

720
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:42,241
Yes, I feel so very sad.

721
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:45,046
- I�m sad, I�m mad, I�m sad, I�m mad. 
- I�m mad, I�m sad, I�m mad, I�m sad.

722
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,222
I�m sorry � that�s better, rent a theater.

723
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:49,302
Look, I say we hit a bar, get some drinks,

724
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,512
continue plotting out this musical you guys are writing.

725
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,408
Cool. We�ll need pens and paper.

726
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:54,366
Just memorize it.

727
00:27:54,478 --> 00:27:56,177
I�m mad, I�m sad, I�m mad, I�m sad.

728
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:58,373
- We�ll grab a cab. 
- Hey, that fits right in.

729
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:01,779
You�re nice.

730
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,145
I try.

731
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,135
- Who are you expecting? 
- Oh, Rory.

732
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:08,481
I mean, not that I�m expecting a call because a call could mean something bad,

733
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:11,275
so, not getting a call is probably best.

734
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:12,085
Probably.

735
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,626
I�m just gonna give her a call.

736
00:28:13,754 --> 00:28:14,739
You know, on the drive down here,

737
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,082
you made me promise to stop you if you were gonna call Rory

738
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:19,253
- for the wrong reason. 
- But I left the iron on.

739
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,317
- She�ll turn it off. 
- She�s got this boy.

740
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:22,167
I know.

741
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:23,969
- I shouldn�t call her. 
- It�s up to you.

742
00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:26,765
Hey guys, we got a cab, and the driver likes our song.

743
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,643
- Putting away phone now. 
- Good girl.

744
00:28:39,908 --> 00:28:41,731
- Hello? 
- Good morning.

745
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:44,835
It�s early. Why are you calling so early?

746
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,214
Oh, I don�t know. I must�ve screwed up the time difference.

747
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:49,231
- What time is it there? 
- The same time it is there.

748
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:50,322
Ah, sorry.

749
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:52,196
- How�s it going? 
- Good. A lot of walking.

750
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:54,469
We all had pizza at John�s in the village and wrote a musical.

751
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:55,293
Good for you.

752
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,426
Then we picked the same Dean Martin song

753
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,785
on the jukebox twenty-five times and people started complaining,

754
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:00,782
so we picked the Bee Gees� "New York Mining Disaster"

755
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,825
and they begged for Dean Martin back.

756
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:03,705
Sounds fun.

757
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:05,882
So, how�d the dinner go?

758
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:08,197
Not well. Far from well.

759
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:08,857
What?

760
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,244
I�m at Grandma�s.

761
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:11,612
- You stayed the night? 
- Yup.

762
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:13,393
What did she do?

763
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:14,574
Did she make you stay

764
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:16,143
because she didn�t want Jess to drive you home?

765
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,903
She is so untrusting. And to ruin this dinner � I�m gonna kill her.

766
00:29:19,072 --> 00:29:20,633
No, Grandma was great.

767
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:22,343
The whole time, even when Jess was late.

768
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:23,208
You�re kidding.

769
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:25,741
She was a saint. Staying over was my idea.

770
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:26,445
Why?

771
00:29:26,568 --> 00:29:29,680
Jess and I got into the most horrible fight of my life and it was...

772
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,100
- I can�t even say. 
- I don�t believe this.

773
00:29:33,243 --> 00:29:35,429
He showed up with a big black eye.

774
00:29:35,645 --> 00:29:38,445
- A black guy? 
- Eye, a black eye.

775
00:29:38,697 --> 00:29:40,467
- He got into a fight. 
- With who, Dean?

776
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:42,075
He wouldn�t say, but yes,

777
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,508
and he was all standoffish about it and things got worse and worse

778
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,826
and he walked out. It was all horrible.

779
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:49,408
Wow, honey. I�m sorry. Are you okay?

780
00:29:49,673 --> 00:29:51,067
I�m upset, but I�m okay.

781
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,519
Oh, I thought I heard you up. How �bout some breakfast?

782
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:57,488
Sure.

783
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:59,823
- Is that Jess? 
- No, it�s Mom.

784
00:29:59,985 --> 00:30:01,824
- Hey, put her on. 
- She wants to talk to you.

785
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:04,656
- Bye. 
- See ya tonight.

786
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,624
- Hello? 
- Mom, hi, listen.

787
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:12,934
Rory kind of explained what happened last night,

788
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:15,586
and how you were really great about it.

789
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:16,934
I just wanted to thank you.

790
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,188
I mean, I don�t know all the details,

791
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:20,851
but I�m sure it all could�ve been way worse,

792
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:25,116
and you keeping your cool like that was really, really nice.

793
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,415
Thanks.

794
00:30:26,937 --> 00:30:30,516
How can you let your daughter be with that abominable thug?

795
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:31,914
- Mom... 
- First he arrives late,

796
00:30:32,027 --> 00:30:34,541
how disrespectful is that? Then he�s rude to Rory, rude to me.

797
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,122
- Mom... 
- Oh, and that attitude,

798
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,882
I wanted to slap that monosyllabic mouth of his.

799
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:42,886
And God forbid they�re in another accident together or his heap of a car breaks down

800
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:45,179
and Lord Jim has decided cell phones are beneath him

801
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:46,997
and they�re stranded in the middle of nowhere.

802
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,779
How can you let this happen?

803
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:51,211
He had a black eye. He belongs in jail!

804
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,129
Yo, dude, that�s disrespectful.

805
00:31:01,216 --> 00:31:02,552
We�re really early. Let�s get something to eat.

806
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:03,777
Sure, what do we want?

807
00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:05,031
I�ve only got three bucks.

808
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:06,848
You always only got three bucks.

809
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:10,120
What is it, you go to an ATM that only gives out three bucks at a time?

810
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:10,970
Let�s just pick.

811
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:14,390
I�m sick of burgers, so if it could be a place that has more than burgers �

812
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:16,474
What do you want, like a three-dollar sushi place?

813
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:17,611
It doesn�t have to be sushi.

814
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,362
Guys, shut up and be cool. Don�t say a thing.

815
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:21,911
- What, why? 
- Mrs. Kim, hello.

816
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,221
- David. 
- David?

817
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:25,501
Mrs. Kim. You�re Lane�s mom?

818
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:26,448
How do you know Lane?

819
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,967
- She�s a great dr... 
- Girl. We all think so.

820
00:31:29,444 --> 00:31:31,072
Who are you? What is all this, David?

821
00:31:31,132 --> 00:31:32,407
Who are all these unwashed boys?

822
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:37,261
Well, see, Zach and Brian here play in a combo with me when I don�t play solo.

823
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,323
- A combo? 
- A Christian combo.

824
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:42,365
Oh, good. With just a guitar it can sound thin.

825
00:31:42,463 --> 00:31:43,944
That�s why we play music together.

826
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,185
The light�s turned, we should probably get...

827
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:47,604
Wait, I want to warn you about something.

828
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:48,982
- Yes? 
- About Lane.

829
00:31:49,104 --> 00:31:50,917
- She has a crush on you. 
- She does?

830
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:53,886
I thought you should know. She�s a good girl, but flighty sometimes.

831
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:57,916
Be careful around her. I know you�re a serious boy, I don�t want you to be shocked.

832
00:31:58,002 --> 00:32:00,574
Oh, no, thank you. I�ll be very careful, I promise.

833
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:01,546
Okay.

834
00:32:01,977 --> 00:32:05,242
Maybe I�ll book your combo sometime, mix it up a little.

835
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:06,595
It would be our pleasure. Right, guys?

836
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,361
- Yeah. 
- Sure.

837
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:09,395
Don�t speed.

838
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:16,256
Okay, so, where do we wanna eat?

839
00:32:28,022 --> 00:32:29,476
- Hey. 
- Hey there.

840
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:30,816
Did you see those fliers?

841
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:33,818
Apparently, I clicked my heels for joy after one of her songs.

842
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:36,025
- I don�t remember that. 
- Me neither.

843
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,290
Can I talk to you for a sec?

844
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:38,749
Yeah, what�s wrong?

845
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:41,452
Dean, this whole friend thing with us isn�t going to work

846
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:42,588
if we�re not honest with each other.

847
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:43,407
I agree.

848
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:45,081
Okay, so, anything you wanna tell me?

849
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:47,201
Corn�s two for a dollar?

850
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:49,259
- Jess has a black eye. 
- Oh yeah?

851
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:50,468
Any idea where he got it?

852
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:52,455
That would be an extremely long list.

853
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:54,036
- It wasn�t you? 
- It wasn�t me.

854
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:55,358
- You swear? 
- I swear.

855
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:57,796
- Did he say it was me? 
- No, he�s not saying anything.

856
00:32:57,944 --> 00:33:01,446
- He�s less talkative than some. 
- Yeah, sorry, I have no idea.

857
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:05,680
- Look, I really don�t like talking about...
- I know, sorry, I...

858
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:08,557
- I should get back to work. 
- Okay, thanks.

859
00:33:09,013 --> 00:33:10,830
- Sorry I couldn�t solve the mystery. 
- Me, too.

860
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:16,523
- Whoa. 
- What?

861
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,875
You�re Petey the dog.

862
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:19,207
I prefer to not talk about this.

863
00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:20,552
Is that why you snuck in last night?

864
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:21,792
I did not sneak in.

865
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,821
Now, could we get back to work here?

866
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:25,182
Fine, start clearing some stuff.

867
00:33:28,546 --> 00:33:29,918
So when�d you get into a fight with Dean?

868
00:33:30,154 --> 00:33:31,198
It wasn�t a fight with Dean.

869
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:32,842
Whoa, where�s that coming from? I just asked.

870
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,043
What�s with everybody making assumptions? I�m sick of it.

871
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,246
- So it wasn�t Dean. 
- No.

872
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:38,003
- When did it happen, yesterday? 
- Yes.

873
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:39,830
You went to Rory�s grandmother yesterday. She punch you?

874
00:33:40,158 --> 00:33:41,703
- Stop. 
- Where�d you get it?

875
00:33:42,017 --> 00:33:43,640
- Santa Claus. 
- So you�re not gonna tell me?

876
00:33:43,763 --> 00:33:44,423
That�s right.

877
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,233
Hello?

878
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,704
Yeah, hey Rory, hang on a sec. It�s Rory.

879
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:51,776
- I�m not here. 
- What?

880
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:54,029
Get a clue, Columbo. I don�t wanna talk to her.

881
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,104
You don�t wanna talk to Rory?

882
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,286
Yeah, Rory? Yeah, he just went someplace.

883
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:01,094
Yeah, I�ll tell him. Bye.

884
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:04,928
- Come on. 
- Hey.

885
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,563
- Come on, what is this? 
- Look, you�re my responsibility.

886
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:11,451
You�re exhibiting signs of violent behavior

887
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,376
and I don�t care how much you don�t wanna talk about it,

888
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:15,948
you�re not leaving until you tell me. Now, tell me, where�d you get the black eye?

889
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,236
- You wouldn�t believe it anyway. 
- Try me, tough guy.

890
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:21,554
A swan.

891
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:22,952
Excuse me?

892
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:25,395
I was attacked by a swan.

893
00:34:25,553 --> 00:34:28,865
Okay, you happy? A stupid swan.

894
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:31,892
Now, how �bout the real story?

895
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,330
That is the real story.

896
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:35,112
It hangs out by Larson�s Dock.

897
00:34:35,317 --> 00:34:38,993
I was just walking by and the thing came out of nowhere and bam �

898
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:41,250
- beaked me right in the eye. 
- It beaked you?

899
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,715
You still don�t believe me.

900
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,956
I just never heard anyone use the word beaked as a verb before.

901
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:47,231
No, no, this isn�t funny.

902
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:51,173
That stupid bird attacked me.

903
00:34:51,578 --> 00:34:54,896
He could�ve blinded me. It�s a vicious, vicious bird, and...

904
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:57,476
fine. Forget it.

905
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:03,543
What are you doing?

906
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:05,295
Where are you going?

907
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:07,157
I�m gonna do a little beaking of my own.

908
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,800
Jess, not the ladle. That�s a brand new ladle.

909
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:12,088
Take the baster!

910
00:35:15,787 --> 00:35:16,630
I don�t see a swan.

911
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:18,183
Put your oars down.

912
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:19,105
They don�t like oars?

913
00:35:19,503 --> 00:35:20,716
Just lay low, it�ll come.

914
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:23,835
Does it act all peaceful and Bambi-like

915
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:26,477
and then suddenly attack like the rabbit in Monty Python?

916
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:28,392
Your voice is probably scaring it away.

917
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:33,174
So how�d you explain the black eye to the Gilmores?

918
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:35,852
I didn�t. The whole night sucked. I�m happy it�s behind me.

919
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:38,735
Behind you? You ain�t got nothing behind you.

920
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:39,548
What do you mean?

921
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,258
You�ll have plenty more events like that in your future.

922
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:42,302
No way.

923
00:35:42,902 --> 00:35:45,729
When you date a girl like Rory, you�re involved with her whole family.

924
00:35:45,805 --> 00:35:49,272
Just like that last girl you dated, you were involved with her whole petri dish.

925
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:50,761
At least she was easy to figure out.

926
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:52,078
And you were bored from day one.

927
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:53,526
I�m dating Rory, not her family.

928
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:56,327
All these people come in a package with this girl.

929
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,737
The mother comes with this girl. The grandmother comes with this girl.

930
00:35:59,855 --> 00:36:01,371
And apparently a bunch of others.

931
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:03,110
Everybody she�s ever met, including Dean.

932
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,002
She picked you.

933
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:05,517
God knows why.

934
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,084
She knows, that�s all that matters.

935
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,049
Jess, being jealous of Dean...

936
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:11,466
I am not jealous of Dean.

937
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:13,858
Being jealous of Dean is pointless.

938
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:15,706
You�re just gonna drive Rory away.

939
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:18,083
You wanna have a relationship with someone,

940
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:20,586
you�re gonna have to learn to open up your mouth and say something.

941
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:22,463
Give it a rest, Dr. Phil.

942
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:25,574
You can�t shut down, you can�t avoid her calls.

943
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:26,750
I didn�t wanna talk.

944
00:36:26,843 --> 00:36:28,271
- When are you gonna wanna talk? 
- I don�t know.

945
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:30,713
So, what are you gonna do, just keep avoiding her

946
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:32,008
- and never take her calls again? 
- She�ll find me eventually.

947
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:33,964
If she keeps looking for you.

948
00:36:34,113 --> 00:36:35,686
Hey, I�m not gonna be a wuss like Dean.

949
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,581
Dean had that girl for two years.

950
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:40,171
You have a little fight after two months, you walk out, and it�s over?

951
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,619
- I don�t care. 
- Okay, fine, you don�t care, that�s obvious.

952
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:46,489
- Is that the one? 
- That�s it. Watch it.

953
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:47,553
I�m watching it.

954
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:49,059
It�s pretty.

955
00:36:51,122 --> 00:36:52,608
- Is it gonna double back? 
- Maybe.

956
00:36:52,714 --> 00:36:54,440
So it�s lulling us into complacency.

957
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:56,735
- He�s vicious, I�m telling you. 
- Yeah, his butt�s terrifying.

958
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:59,693
It�s outnumbered. That�s the problem. It knows there�s two of us.

959
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,731
So you want me to get under water, swim along with the boat,

960
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:04,010
- breathe through a straw? 
- Forget it.

961
00:37:04,603 --> 00:37:06,651
Maybe it�s gonna get another swan and come back

962
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:08,660
- and make a fight of it, huh? 
- Forget it.

963
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,273
He�s not even calling you back, huh?

964
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:14,946
No, and I�m not sure what to do.

965
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:17,634
Dave and I have never had a fight

966
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,441
because we haven�t really truly begun dating,

967
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:20,819
so I have no perspective on this.

968
00:37:20,961 --> 00:37:23,599
You�d better hurry up and start having bad boy troubles

969
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:24,750
so I can get some feedback.

970
00:37:26,988 --> 00:37:28,063
- Hey there. 
- Hi guys.

971
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:29,011
How�s it going?

972
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:31,279
I think it�s going a little weird, to tell you the truth.

973
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:32,115
Weird, why?

974
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:33,779
I think we need to get something out in the open here.

975
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:34,545
Definitely.

976
00:37:34,673 --> 00:37:35,636
We ran into your mom.

977
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:37,039
- My mom? 
- Oh boy.

978
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,579
Yeah, and we�re well aware that there�s a situation here

979
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:40,787
that you guys have been hiding.

980
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,785
We should get it out in the open here or else it�s gonna get weirder.

981
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:45,175
Yeah, I guess so. We didn�t mean anything by hiding it guys.

982
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:48,493
What pisses us off is that you felt you had to hide it.

983
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:49,552
- Really? 
- Yeah.

984
00:37:49,808 --> 00:37:53,634
Dave, you�re a Christian. So what? That�s cool.

985
00:37:53,736 --> 00:37:56,060
- It�s nothing to hide. 
- Christians can still rock.

986
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:57,483
They can?

987
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:01,308
Yeah, Dave. Christians can still rock, don�t hide it.

988
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:04,401
Marshall Stacks don�t know Christians from atheists.

989
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:08,568
Gosh, I just wasn�t sure if you guys would be accepting of my devoutness.

990
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,717
Dave, it�s a part of you, and we think you�re cool, so it�s cool.

991
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:13,412
Great. Thanks, guys.

992
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,190
But no way are we playing Creed, man.

993
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:16,187
Oh, no, of course not.

994
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,903
Or Amy Grant. That�s where we draw the line.

995
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,469
This is very accepting of you guys.

996
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:21,850
And we�d be totally into playing that gig for your mom if it pays.

997
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:24,119
Oh, Mrs. Kim pays. She�s very good about that.

998
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,843
That�s my mom. I�m glad this all worked out.

999
00:38:25,977 --> 00:38:26,883
Yeah, me too.

1000
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:34,082
Oh, my little daughter.

1001
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,275
I�m happy to see you.

1002
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:39,243
- Thanks for bringing her back in one piece. 
- No problem.

1003
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,634
- I�m very weak. 
- She hasn�t eaten in awhile.

1004
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,262
I warned you to keep to her feeding schedule.

1005
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:44,408
I�m drifting, drifting.

1006
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:46,278
- She wanted to wait to have dinner with you. 
- That�s sweet.

1007
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,392
- Must have food now. 
- I�ll take it from here.

1008
00:38:48,638 --> 00:38:49,877
- Thanks. 
- Bye.

1009
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,904
- You�re not food. 
- Revive her.

1010
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,956
I will. I�m gonna run and get take out.

1011
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:56,061
Oh, make like the wind.

1012
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:57,870
- Can you make it to the door? 
- I�ll struggle.

1013
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:05,268
- Rory. 
- Oh, hey.

1014
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,712
Hey. Your mom home?

1015
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:07,935
I�m bringing supplies.

1016
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:10,029
- Should�ve brought a mule. 
- What?

1017
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,160
- A pack mule, to carry it. 
- Oh, yeah.

1018
00:39:12,575 --> 00:39:14,397
So, sorry I missed your calls.

1019
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,411
You were always out.

1020
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:17,735
Yeah. I was getting ready to call you just now,

1021
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:18,914
but you would�ve been out.

1022
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:20,603
- Ironic. 
- Yeah.

1023
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,470
So, I know there was no fight with Dean.

1024
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:24,919
Really? How?

1025
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:27,653
You asked Dean.

1026
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,399
It was the only thing I could think to do.

1027
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:30,582
To go to the source.

1028
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,619
Yup. I�m sorry I doubted you.

1029
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,339
It�s okay. I would�ve doubted me, too.

1030
00:39:34,463 --> 00:39:36,654
- I need to trust you as much as I trusted... 
- Him.

1031
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:39,382
This black eye screwed everything up.

1032
00:39:39,496 --> 00:39:42,557
Next time I go to your grandmother�s, I�ll try not to have one.

1033
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:44,037
- Next time? 
- Next time.

1034
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,479
So what happened?

1035
00:39:49,771 --> 00:39:51,190
- I don�t... 
- Come on.

1036
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:53,550
- It wasn�t Dean, you can say. 
- Will that make you happy?

1037
00:39:53,704 --> 00:39:54,871
Yes, very.

1038
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:58,194
Okay, I�ll tell you the truth, since we�re both so into the truth tonight.

1039
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:00,093
That�s what good relationships are about, right?

1040
00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:00,800
Right.

1041
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:03,611
But you�ve gotta promise not to mock me ever,

1042
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,894
and please don�t tell anyone else.

1043
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,231
Promise.

1044
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:15,044
I was throwing a football with a buddy and got hit in the eye.

1045
00:40:15,335 --> 00:40:16,672
- You poor thing. 
- Yeah.

1046
00:40:17,337 --> 00:40:18,556
But that�s not embarrassing.

1047
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,271
Yeah, now that you mention it, it�s not.

1048
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:35,750
- I have to go. 
- Don�t go.

1049
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:37,305
- I don�t want to. 
- Then don�t.

1050
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:38,883
- Let�s go somewhere. 
- I�ve got takeout.

1051
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:41,105
- I�ll reimburse you. 
- My mom�s waiting.

1052
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:49,931
Keep thinking what you�re thinking.

1053
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:51,079
I don�t have a choice.

1054
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:01,692
Mom?

1055
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:04,713
Hm? Is that you, Rhett?

1056
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:05,906
I bring food.

1057
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,325
Oh, thank God. Ha! One of everything at Al�s.

1058
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:12,223
Bless you with gluttony.

1059
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:15,450
- Aren�t you hungry? 
- Yeah.

1060
00:41:17,032 --> 00:41:19,039
Well, come on, dig in.

1061
00:41:22,183 --> 00:41:22,895
What�s wrong?

1062
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:24,629
Nothing.

1063
00:41:27,482 --> 00:41:28,204
Listen.

1064
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:30,810
I�m listening.

1065
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:35,700
When I said before that I was too busy to think about it,

1066
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,316
I realized now that I�m not too busy to think about it.

1067
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:41,030
- Think about it? 
- About it.

1068
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:43,718
Oh, it.

1069
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:46,473
Yeah, it.

1070
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:48,383
Ha, it.

1071
00:41:49,437 --> 00:41:51,172
Nothing�s happened yet, but...

1072
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,536
it might.

1073
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:54,025
Maybe.

1074
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:55,059
Maybe?

1075
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:56,523
Maybe...

1076
00:41:57,532 --> 00:41:58,228
with Jess.

1077
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,189
Hm, with Jess.

1078
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:02,652
You still want me to tell you everything, right?

1079
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,834
Yeah. No. Well...

1080
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:05,795
Which is it?

1081
00:42:06,282 --> 00:42:07,413
We�re doing this now.

1082
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:09,057
Yes. Which is it?

1083
00:42:09,508 --> 00:42:10,332
I don�t know.

1084
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:12,105
- You�ll let me know? 
- Yeah.

1085
00:42:12,862 --> 00:42:14,869
Was that, yeah, you�ll let me know,

1086
00:42:14,987 --> 00:42:17,049
or yeah, that�s your answer, you wanna know?

1087
00:42:17,572 --> 00:42:19,502
I guess, I wanna know, yes,

1088
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:22,000
and now, sure.

1089
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:23,603
Well, nothing�s happened.

1090
00:42:24,228 --> 00:42:26,112
- I heard. 
- But it might.

1091
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:27,515
Okay.

1092
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:31,165
Could you tell me before it does?

1093
00:42:31,637 --> 00:42:34,893
- Right before, or... 
- No, just... just before.

1094
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:35,962
Okay.

1095
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:37,540
Okay, good.

1096
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:42,492
- Is that it? 
- For tonight, yeah.

1097
00:42:43,316 --> 00:42:43,951
Good.

1098
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:46,685
This... this is good.

1099
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:48,482
Yeah, it is good.

1100
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:51,501
Okay, well, let�s eat.

1101
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:52,378
Good.
