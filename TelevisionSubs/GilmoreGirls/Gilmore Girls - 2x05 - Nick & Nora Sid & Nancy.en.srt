1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,505
- How are the eggs?
- Good.

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:05,881
I'm glad.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,385
- They're still good.
- I'm still glad.

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,638
- Freak, we'll not be late.
- It's the first day.

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,140
- I want to get there early.
- We will. I promise.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,018
I have different classes this year.
My routes aren't the same.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,355
I haven't found the quickest path around.
And they moved my locker.

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,107
If it doesn't work properly
I'll have to get a new one.

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,568
God knows how long that'll take
and where it'll be.

10
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,071
That could send the whole day into chaos.

11
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,656
I'm just excited.

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,242
- Thank God, you haven't left yet.
- No, what's up?

13
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,369
I found the greatest record store
in the world.

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,080
It's 10 minutes from your school.
How much do you love me?

15
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,122
Address?

16
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,168
Record Breaker Incorporated,
2453 Berlin Turnpike.

17
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:47,381
- Got it. Place your order now.
- Yes. Okay.

18
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,551
Charles Mingus,
The Black Saint And The Sinner Lady.

19
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,220
- The Sonics, Here Are the Sonics.
- Burn me a copy.

20
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,931
- Next.
- MC5, Kick Out The Jams.

21
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,475
Fairport Convention, Liege & Lief.
Bee Gees, Odessa.

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,560
Really?

23
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,854
- Mojo says.
- So it must be true.

24
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,980
That's it.

25
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,441
If I could find a copy of
Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill...

26
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,402
I will finally be done with the '60s.

27
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,529
I can get there today.
Tomorrow at the latest.

28
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,115
- I love it when you go back to school.
- Me, too.

29
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,910
I am getting doughnuts for later.
As soon as I do, I'll take you to school...

30
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,121
and nice men in white coats
will pick you up.

31
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,205
Everybody, listen up:

32
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,834
Decide what you want, place your order,
proceed to the end of the line.

33
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,669
- I want a burger.
- I want grilled cheese.

34
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,046
And I want fries.
And make them really crispy.

35
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,049
- I want mine crispy, too.
- You didn't order fries.

36
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,969
You can't order crispy fries
without first ordering fries.

37
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,053
Why not?

38
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,556
You can't make something crispy
that doesn't exist.

39
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,391
- Why not?
- Get him away from me.

40
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,517
Have some respect.

41
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:45,230
These boys just completed the first leg
of their outdoor-survival training.

42
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,358
Meaning you had them sit under a tree
and glue rocks together.

43
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,320
You're a very jaded man.
What happened to you as a child?

44
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,656
A creepy guy in shorts and knee socks
tried to sit me under a tree...

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,074
and glue rocks together.

46
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,284
- Put that down.
- Why?

47
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,703
- Otherwise you're going under it.
- I won't fit.

48
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,496
- Yes, you will.
- Doughnuts, please.

49
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,999
- We were here first!
- On the planet?

50
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,085
You lose.
Chocolate cinnamon and sprinkles.

51
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,088
Pipe down!

52
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,507
Grumps, huh?

53
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,092
Yeah, I'm working.
What do you think I'm doing?

54
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,387
Man. What did you do?

55
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,140
Excuse me? Are you serious?

56
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,894
Mr. Doose, she's not supposed to do that.

57
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,480
That's right. She's breaking the rules...

58
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,565
and people who break the rules...

59
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:33,070
end up very lonely with no friends
because they become society's outcasts.

60
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,572
Planning on burning
a little Huck Finn after lunch?

61
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,783
- Excuse me?
- This is unbelievable!

62
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,160
You will never change, will you?

63
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,538
Okay, fine.

64
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,498
Do what you want,
make the arrangements.

65
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,417
Now, I'm working. We'll finish this later.

66
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,380
- Is everything okay?
- Do you have a sister?

67
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,840
- No.
- I do.

68
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,134
- You have my sympathies.
- Thanks. I appreciate that.

69
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,240
- Hey.
- Hello.

70
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,327
- What are you doing?
- Just redecorating the sidewalk.

71
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,913
- Looks nice.
- You don't think too much blue?

72
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,374
- No, just enough.
- Thanks for the input. You can go now.

73
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,043
- Need some help?
- Nope.

74
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,507
Do you need some help?

75
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,594
Since when do you buy Frosted Flakes?

76
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,390
- Okay, now, what is going on?
- Nothing.

77
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,101
Nothing? You just woke up this morning...

78
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,479
and decided to buy every food item
in the world...

79
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,773
- that you don't actually eat?
- It's not for me.

80
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,484
- Who is it for?
- Someone who's not me.

81
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,946
- Like who?
- Like my nephew.

82
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,491
- Your nephew's coming to visit.
- No, he's coming to stay.

83
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,910
- Your sister's moving here?
- No.

84
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:49,081
- I'm sorry, I don't get it.
- There's nothing to get. She's just Liz.

85
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,084
She's busy, she can't handle him,
she's sending him here.

86
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,585
Where's his dad?

87
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,256
The great prize that my sister picked up
at a Der Wienerschnitzel...

88
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,092
left her about two years ago,
whereabouts unknown.

89
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,596
So she's sending him here, just like that?

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,225
No, I'm sure she put at least
five or six minutes of thought into it.

91
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,768
But why?

92
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,937
He's been getting into some trouble...

93
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,398
and Liz is afraid
he's heading for something bad...

94
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,609
and rather than handle it herself,
she's given up.

95
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,946
She's sending him here
so I can straighten him out.

96
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,447
- You?
- Yes.

97
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,408
- You can straighten him out?
- Yes.

98
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,703
Luke, the great communicator,
you're going to straighten the kid out?

99
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,747
All he needs is a change of pace,
a new crowd...

100
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,542
and to get away from the nut job...

101
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,628
that unfortunately is my sister.

102
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,923
- How long is he staying?
- I don't know. Indefinitely.

103
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,967
- How old is he?
- Seventeen.

104
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,929
That is very generous of you.

105
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,307
- It's family. What else can you do?
- Right.

106
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,643
- What kind of trouble has he gotten into?
- Just kid stuff.

107
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,314
You know, staying out late, getting rowdy.

108
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,902
- I don't know exactly.
- You might want to find out.

109
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,322
Ask a couple of subtle questions.
Has he seen The Shawshank Redemption?

110
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,782
Did the setting seem homey to him?
Stuff like that.

111
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,535
His problem is obvious. It's his mother.

112
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,246
We never could count on Liz for anything.

113
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,667
Our mom died when we were kids, right?
It was just my dad, me, and Liz.

114
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,755
My dad worked all the time
and I worked in the store with my dad...

115
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,549
and Liz was off doing God knows what.

116
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,843
I bet losing her mom so early
was hard on her.

117
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,179
It was hard on all of us
but we did our part.

118
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,390
And the minute she graduates high school,
she is out of here.

119
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:34,228
Didn't matter that my dad was sick.
Didn't matter that the store was failing.

120
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,898
She just took off. Married
the hot dog king, had a kid, he left.

121
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,107
Now here we are.

122
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,986
- Yeah. I'm sorry, what are you doing?
- I'm blowing this up.

123
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,404
- What is it?
- It's a bed.

124
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,739
- A bed?
- For Jess.

125
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,115
- Jess?
- My nephew.

126
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,076
That's not a bed, that's a raft.

127
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,453
It's fine if you'll build a moat
around the diner...

128
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,372
- It's fine.
- The kid needs a bed.

129
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,250
If you want to get him
something inflatable, make it a blonde.

130
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,627
I'm getting him a bed.
This is just temporary.

131
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,839
- How does Jess feel about this?
- I don't know.

132
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,007
- You haven't talked to him about it?
- No.

133
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,885
- Don't you think you should?
- Why? He doesn't have a choice.

134
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,638
His mom's a flake, he's coming here.
End of story.

135
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,932
- Are you sure you're ready for this?
- Of course.

136
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,935
Taking on a full-time kid,
that's a lot of work.

137
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,019
I know.

138
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,189
A 17-year-old who's been in trouble
and is being shipped off...

139
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,149
without his consent, that could be harder.

140
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,653
All he needs is to be around someone
who's not a selfish basket case...

141
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,739
who will give him a little space,
who will treat him like a man.

142
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,659
- You should think about this.
- There's nothing to think about.

143
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,202
You take care of family. Period.

144
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,663
I respect that.
But what if he turns out to be Fredo?

145
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:38,333
- Are you telling me not to do this?
- No, I'm not.

146
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,585
Then what are you saying?

147
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,213
I'm just saying
that if you need any help, I'm here.

148
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,090
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

149
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,467
I got a lot of things to do
before he gets here.

150
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,261
Okay, I'm leaving.

151
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,934
- You do have an extra set of sheets, right?
- Yes, I do.

152
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,103
Sorry. Just checking. Bye.

153
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,194
Sheets.

154
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,999
Okay, round two.

155
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,044
- Five seconds?
- Four.

156
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,253
- Fine.
- Now it's three.

157
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,797
- Paris, it does not have to be like this.
- No?

158
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,218
You and I are going to spend
a lot of time together on the Franklin.

159
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,302
I know.

160
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,514
We're going to sit in the same classroom,
share the same oxygen.

161
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,433
- Occasionally make eye contact.
- I can avoid that.

162
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,228
I'm not saying that we should be friends.
I don't want that.

163
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,773
I'm just saying
that we should look at this like life.

164
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,775
- Life?
- Yes, in life...

165
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,986
there will be people you don't like
but you have to coexist with.

166
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,490
- I'm well aware of that.
- So I'm just suggesting that we coexist.

167
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,535
You're scared I'll make your life
on the Franklin a living hell.

168
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,745
Especially since I'm the editor
and you're...

169
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,081
What's the word? Not.

170
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,835
If you want to spend the precious energy
that you would spend on the paper...

171
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,587
obsessing on making me miserable,
then that's your choice.

172
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,881
I'm just suggesting an alternate plan.

173
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:11,051
- The paper could be really great this year.
- I know.

174
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,096
So can't we agree on that
and make the rest of it go away?

175
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,556
Everything okay?

176
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,642
Yeah, everything's fine.
We were just talking.

177
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,186
- Talking? You two?
- About the Franklin.

178
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,523
Nope, still seems weird.

179
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,692
We're all on the paper together.

180
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,736
There's going to be a lot of
long afternoons and weekends.

181
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,823
- We need to coexist. Right?
- Right.

182
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,033
I'm sorry, back up to the weekends.

183
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:38,871
So that's what we'll do.
The first meeting of the Franklin is today.

184
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,330
- Yes, it is.
- 4:00.

185
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,832
Sounds good.

186
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,794
Weekends were never mentioned.
I need my weekends.

187
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,463
All of this gets done on weekends.

188
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,362
- Jess.
- Luke.

189
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,911
Okay, so...

190
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,052
This is my diner.

191
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,305
It belonged to your grandpa.

192
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,484
Here we are.

193
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,780
It's pretty simple. This is the room.

194
00:10:55,697 --> 00:11:00,035
That's my bed. That's your bed for now,
but the sheets are new.

195
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,455
There's the bathroom,
there's the closet, there's the dresser...

196
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,291
the phone, and over there is the kitchen.

197
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,794
I've got Frosted Flakes.

198
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,046
Wow, that's great.

199
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,383
- Is that all your stuff?
- Yup.

200
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,805
- Not much there.
- Lizzie's sending the rest later.

201
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,307
- You need some help?
- Nope.

202
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,186
I have to get back to the diner.

203
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,566
- I'm going to close at 10:00, so I thought...
- See you at 10:00.

204
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,402
- But wait. You need keys.
- No, I don't.

205
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,407
I so don't want to know why.

206
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,213
The op-ed page is sad.
It's worse than sad. It's unopinionated.

207
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,048
Pick a side, people.

208
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,592
- Rory.
- Hey.

209
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,678
- Nice of you to join us.
- I thought we were starting at 4:00.

210
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,514
No, we start at 3:15 sharp.

211
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,016
- We're wasting time here.
- Take a seat.

212
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,142
Sorry.

213
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:50,979
Okay, so we were just finishing up
handing out the first assignments.

214
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,607
Rory, unfortunately,
since you got here so late...

215
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,567
everything of interest has been given out.

216
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:59,613
- Why, I'm shocked.
- Wait, just let me check my list here.

217
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,115
There might be something left for you.

218
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,910
They're paving
the new parking lot tomorrow.

219
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,662
- And?
- You can cover it.

220
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,622
- Cover what?
- The paving process.

221
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,415
- You're serious?
- Absolutely.

222
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,334
I'm sure there's an angle somewhere.

223
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,046
Is it environmentally safe?
What are the financial ramifications?

224
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,633
Should brick have been considered,
taking into account the architecture?

225
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,051
Yeah, I get the idea.

226
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:25,222
If you think this is below you,
you can wait until the next issue.

227
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,641
You can use this time
to get a nice manicure.

228
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,226
- That's okay.
- Maybe get a massage.

229
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,020
- I'll do it.
- Aromatherapy. Smell like a peach.

230
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,857
- I'll do it, okay? I'll cover the paving.
- Okay, good.

231
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,608
I guess that's it.

232
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:47,452
- Problem, Miss Gilmore?
- No problem at all. I love this assignment.

233
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,537
I'm glad.

234
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,914
I'll write the best piece
on pavement you've read.

235
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:51,999
I hope so.

236
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,335
I'll be thrilled with next week's scoop
on the plumbing installation.

237
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,420
I like a team player.

238
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,965
No matter how many crappy,
stupid assignments you throw at me...

239
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,467
I'm not going to quit,
and I'm not going to back down.

240
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,928
You can go home tonight
and think about the fact...

241
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,264
that no matter what you do
and how evil you are...

242
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,808
at the end of the year,
on my high school transcript...

243
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,810
it will say that I worked on the Franklin.

244
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:16,148
If you'll excuse me, I have some reading
to do on the origins of concrete.

245
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,567
A thousand words on my desk on Tuesday.

246
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,080
Sorry.

247
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,295
Hi.

248
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,215
- Sorry.
- No, I just...

249
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,635
- You want some coffee?
- I'll just lick it off the table.

250
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,261
- So?
- So what?

251
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,930
- Is he here?
- He's here.

252
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,890
- Yeah? How is he?
- He's fine.

253
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,934
- Did he see the bed?
- He saw the bed.

254
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,853
- Where is he? I want to meet him.
- He's out.

255
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,939
- Out where?
- I don't know.

256
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,358
- You don't?
- No, he just went out.

257
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,693
- You didn't ask him where he was going?
- No.

258
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,820
- Why not?
- Because he's not two.

259
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,324
But, Luke, he's new in town.
He doesn't know his way around yet.

260
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,368
Way around what? This is Stars Hollow.

261
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,912
Take three left turns,
you're back in the center of town.

262
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,873
When a kid goes out,
you have to ask where he's going.

263
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,709
- Why?
- Because you're responsible for him now.

264
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,671
If he knocks over a liquor store,
it's going to be your fault.

265
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,341
If I had asked him and he actually intended
to knock off a liquor store...

266
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,218
you really think he would have told me?

267
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,846
- Lf he's dumb.
- He's fine. New topic.

268
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,306
Jess, good. I'd like you to meet someone.

269
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,101
Hi. I'm Lorelai.

270
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,687
I wanted to meet you
before Luke filled your head...

271
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,438
with all kinds of lies about me.

272
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,233
You should meet my daughter.
She's about your age.

273
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,361
She can show you
where all the good wilding goes on.

274
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,906
Okay, it's nice to meet you.

275
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,908
I hope you like it here.

276
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,203
So, class dismissed.

277
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,914
Are you hungry? 'Cause I can...

278
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,168
- So that's Jess.
- Yep.

279
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,627
Very chatty.

280
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,130
He's adjusting. He just got here.

281
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:06,133
He probably just realized
there are 12 stores in this town...

282
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,468
devoted entirely
to peddling porcelain unicorns.

283
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,555
I've lived in this town my entire life,
I still can't believe it.

284
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,974
- I'm sure that's it.
- He'll be fine in a few days.

285
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,768
I have a fabulous idea.
What are you doing tomorrow night?

286
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,853
Why?

287
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,897
Why don't you and Jess
come over for dinner?

288
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,982
Sookie will cook, Rory will be there.

289
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,776
It'll be a little,
'Hey, welcome to Stars Hollow.

290
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,989
'See, everyone here is not straight
out of a Fellini film' kind of an evening.

291
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,117
- Okay, that would be nice. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

292
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,662
- You won't bring up the bed?
- I'll definitely bring up the bed.

293
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,294
- My God, I hate her.
- Me, too.

294
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:45,047
- You've no idea who I'm talking about.
- Solidarity, sister.

295
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,341
- Paris.
- That I should have guessed.

296
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,552
- She can't torture me off the paper.
- No, she can't.

297
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,095
I have never met anyone like her.

298
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,640
Her insistence on holding
on to this stupid grudge...

299
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,767
that is based on nothing
and will never end...

300
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,520
shows commitment
that I would have never thought possible.

301
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,980
- I'm beginning to admire her.
- First day sucked?

302
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:05,609
- Just the paper stuff. The rest was good.
- I'm glad to hear it.

303
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,028
Did you happen to run into Max?

304
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,197
- Actually, no.
- Really?

305
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,449
Yeah. Our paths just didn't cross.

306
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,993
- Isn't he your lit. Teacher?
- Yeah.

307
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,704
But I have really tall people
sitting in front of me.

308
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,084
I saw him in the hallway
and I walked the other way.

309
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,168
Why?

310
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,212
I thought that's what you'd want me to do.

311
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,589
Just because Max
isn't a part of my life anymore...

312
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,550
doesn't mean he can't be a part of yours.

313
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,302
He has to be.
You have to see him and talk to him.

314
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,471
And that's okay. That's good.

315
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:36,682
I know everything
seems screwed up right now...

316
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,684
but I don't want you to avoid him.

317
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,728
- Especially not on my account, okay?
- All right.

318
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:44,189
- I'm sorry I put you in this position.
- That's okay.

319
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,025
- It's going on the list.
- My God, that list is getting long.

320
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,110
You have no idea.

321
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,529
We are having
a gathering tomorrow night.

322
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:51,864
What kind of gathering?

323
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,199
Luke's nephew's here
and I thought we could try...

324
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,034
- to make him feel at home.
- You met him?

325
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,661
- Sort of.
- What's he like?

326
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,246
He's not going to be subbing...

327
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,582
for the new dodo on
the Regis show anytime soon.

328
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,125
Let's put it like that.

329
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,345
You got unpacked?

330
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,682
- Got enough space in the closet?
- Plenty.

331
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:21,727
- You hungry?
- Eighteen.

332
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,312
What?

333
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,481
Just counting
how many questions till we hit 20.

334
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,233
Okay, never mind.

335
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:34,364
Yeah, Liz, he got here fine.

336
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,159
- Got here at 10:00 this morning.
- Hang on a second.

337
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,702
- Jess?
- Pass.

338
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,413
- Come on.
- Nope.

339
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,040
What am I supposed to tell her?

340
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,417
Tell her I got to take
another crack at the closet.

341
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,420
I think I hung my Tool T-shirt
next to my Metallica T-shirt...

342
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,546
and they don't get along.

343
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:50,881
You want me to tell her that?

344
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:54,009
You think a different band combo
would sell it more?

345
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,512
Yeah, Liz,
Jess is going to have to call you back.

346
00:18:56,595 --> 00:19:00,641
Yeah, he's helping me out
with a shelf thing and his hands are full.

347
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,769
Yeah, I'll tell him. Okay. Bye.

348
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,941
She said to tell you
that your stuff will be here on Friday.

349
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,317
Great. We'll have a party.

350
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,028
You know, your mom thinks this is...

351
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,198
for the best, for your own good.

352
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:21,453
Anyhow, I guess you'll just call her
when you feel like it.

353
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,455
Want to play some poker?
$5 bucks a hand?

354
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,873
- No.
- $10?

355
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,416
I can't go higher than $10.

356
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,502
- Okay, $15.
- I don't want to play poker.

357
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,295
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

358
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:31,755
Okey-dokey.

359
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,386
So listen, Lorelai,
you met her today, remember?

360
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,763
Anyhow...

361
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,976
she invited us to her house
tomorrow night for dinner.

362
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,271
Her daughter Rory,
who you didn't meet, but you'll like...

363
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,897
'cause she's a lot like Lorelai...

364
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:52,943
but she's got
a slightly tighter grasp on reality.

365
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,696
Anyhow, she'll be there.

366
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,576
It'd be a chance for you
to meet more people...

367
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,537
and so I said yes.

368
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,012
- Hello.
- Hi.

369
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,138
You're early.

370
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,307
I felt so bad about the mix-up last time...

371
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,934
I wanted to make sure
it didn't happen again.

372
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,352
It won't.

373
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:31,815
Did you hear that Kimber Slately
and Tristin are a major item?

374
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,068
I thought she and Sean Asher
were this year's John and Jackie.

375
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,862
Nope, Sean is with Dee McGuire now...

376
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,239
which pushed Jeff Traner
into Dottie Lord's arms...

377
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:41,825
leaving Madison Maylands alone
for the first weekend...

378
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,952
since he became captain
of the lacrosse team.

379
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,663
You know so much so soon.
You have the gift.

380
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:47,706
I know.

381
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,835
Paris, what do you think about me
writing a gossip column for the Franklin?

382
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,172
I don't know. That's a hard one.

383
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,216
I mean, this is the Franklin...

384
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,718
a newspaper that's been around
for almost 100 years.

385
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,221
There have been
10 former editors of the Franklin...

386
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,931
that have gone to the New York Times.

387
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,141
Six have gone on to the Washington Post.

388
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:08,685
Three are contributing editors
at the New Yorker.

389
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,563
I think one even went on
to win the Pulitzer prize.

390
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,898
But never mind them.

391
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,901
I could be the first editor
in the history of the Franklin...

392
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:19,821
to introduce a column exclusively devoted
to who Biffy's boffing today.

393
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,490
Quandary.

394
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:24,284
I'm going to have to get back to you
on that one.

395
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,536
Okay.

396
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,246
Good, we're all here.

397
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,415
And prompt. Lovely.

398
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,337
I read everyone's article and they were
all extremely well done.

399
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,798
Snappy, informative, well-researched.

400
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:41,051
Paris, you should be very proud
of the team you've assembled.

401
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,177
Thank you.

402
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:45,597
When you've got a reporter who can take
an incredibly mundane...

403
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,641
and seemingly unimportant subject...

404
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,977
like the repaving
of the faculty parking lot...

405
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,564
and turn it into a bittersweet piece
on how everybody and everything...

406
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:57,359
eventually becomes obsolete,
then you've really got something.

407
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,944
Miss Gilmore, I was touched.

408
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,404
I owe it all to Paris.

409
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,448
I would strongly advise
that next time you give Miss Gilmore...

410
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,492
something with more meat to it.

411
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,703
Yeah, great idea.

412
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,538
Okay. Let's get down to work.

413
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,748
We've got a layout to put together.

414
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,340
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

415
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,009
You must be very proud of yourself.

416
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,178
I'm not hiding when I pass a mirror.

417
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:28,640
It's part of my job to make sure that our
best writers are writing our best pieces.

418
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,894
So I'm going to give you
one of our best pieces.

419
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,146
Front page, lead story.

420
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,439
Get to the catch.

421
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,024
- No catch.
- No catch?

422
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,318
I'd like to start our year off with a profile...

423
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,695
on the teacher voted most popular
from last year.

424
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,698
You know, an in-depth,
no-holds-barred interview.

425
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,074
Everybody wants it.

426
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:47,576
You have it.

427
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,620
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

428
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,873
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

429
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,376
Go ahead and set up
that interview with Mr. Medina.

430
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,544
What?

431
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:00,088
I'd love it to lead off our first edition.

432
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,466
He was the winner by a landslide.

433
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,426
I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

434
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:08,263
Is there some reason
why you wouldn't want to interview him?

435
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:12,684
After all, you of all people should be able
to get the most in-depth story out of him...

436
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,437
especially since he and your mother
are involved.

437
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,147
They are still involved, aren't they?

438
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:20,025
Let's leave
my mother's personal life out of this.

439
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,486
- That sounds bad.
- It's not bad.

440
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,821
- It's just none of your business.
- Fine.

441
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,907
You want the interview or not?

442
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,826
- Yes, I want the interview.
- Good.

443
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,787
Get me something more
than his favorite color, okay?

444
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,292
Maybe I should make grilled cheese.

445
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,836
But you're making pot roast.

446
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,504
Not everybody likes pot roast.

447
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:44,007
Then they can have chicken wings,
the mashed potatoes, the four salads...

448
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,634
in addition to the pot roast.

449
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,553
Yeah, I guess you're right.

450
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,680
So I should start slicing the cheese.

451
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,723
Would you? That would be great!

452
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,476
Wow, something smells good!

453
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,186
- It's the garlic.
- Three heads of it.

454
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,230
- Nice.
- I want everything to be perfect.

455
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,816
We are going to make this kid
think he went to heaven.

456
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,734
Or Henry the VllI's house.

457
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,653
- Milady?
- Come in.

458
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,739
- You joining the festivities?
- In a sec.

459
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,491
- You sound crabby.
- I'm concentrating.

460
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:10,909
Don't concentrate too hard.

461
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,202
Boys like them dumb. Right?

462
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:15,581
If you can navigate yourself around a tree,
keep on walking.

463
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,416
Coming!

464
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,334
What if he doesn't do dairy?

465
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:22,880
Perfect timing.

466
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:26,216
Sookie's about to break her own record
for the most food served.

467
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,843
- Sounds great.
- Sure does.

468
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,511
So, come on in.

469
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,601
Sorry we're a little late.

470
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:39,021
We had a misunderstanding about
what time we were supposed to leave.

471
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,731
That's okay. How's it going?

472
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,941
Not bad. The bed popped.

473
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,943
- Was anyone in it?
- Me.

474
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,737
- You?
- I let him take the real one.

475
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,989
It was very nice of you.

476
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,328
You want to come on in the kitchen?

477
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,873
Sookie, Jackson, I want you
to meet Luke's nephew.

478
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,750
- This is Jess.
- Do you eat cheese?

479
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,001
What?

480
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:04,421
This is the greatest lemon I've ever grown!
This is a great lemon.

481
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:06,798
Sookie, you got to try this lemon.

482
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:08,258
That is a great lemon!

483
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,426
Try it! It's a Meyer!

484
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,845
Jackson grows fruit
and scares people with it.

485
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:13,764
- Rory, they're here.
- Coming.

486
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,059
Hey.

487
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,310
I'm Rory.

488
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:21,188
- Yeah, I figured.
- Nice to meet you.

489
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,359
Aren't we hooked on phonics?

490
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,694
I read a lot. Do you read?

491
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,572
Not much.

492
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:32,825
I could loan you that. It's great.

493
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,202
No, thanks.

494
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,995
If you change your mind.

495
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,331
We need to
get Jackson away from the lemons...

496
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,416
so we're moving
the feast to the living room.

497
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,960
Be right there.

498
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:45,462
Do these open?

499
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:47,714
You just have to unlatch them
and then push.

500
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,132
Great. Shall we?

501
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,218
- Shall we what?
- Bail.

502
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:53,554
- No.
- Why?

503
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,014
Because it's Tuesday night
in Stars Hollow.

504
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,474
There's nowhere to bail to.

505
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,560
The 24-hour mini-mart
closed 20 minutes ago.

506
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:02,521
We'll walk around or sit on a bench
and stare at our shoes.

507
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,023
Sookie just made
a ton of really great food...

508
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:08,527
and though it may not seem like it
at this moment, it's going to be fun.

509
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,445
- Trust me.
- I don't even know you.

510
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,322
- Don't I look trustworthy?
- Maybe.

511
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,949
Good. Let's eat.

512
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:17,870
You want a soda?

513
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,997
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

514
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,220
Do you know
Pam was originally made out of rice?

515
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,263
What?

516
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,640
Rory, where's Jess?

517
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:40,184
He's getting a soda.

518
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,935
You must've mistaken me for you.

519
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,896
Too much? I forgot the garlic bread.

520
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,314
I'll get it.

521
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:48,525
- More potatoes?
- Okay.

522
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,402
Everyone needs more potatoes.

523
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:53,822
- Nothing wrong with potatoes.
- I've got 6 pounds in the oven.

524
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:57,951
More chicken?

525
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:00,370
- Throw a couple of bird wings on there.
- All right.

526
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:03,540
- Salad, no dressing.
- Want some more?

527
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,626
- You want some?
- Okay.

528
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,512
For me? Hey, thanks.

529
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:20,974
Refreshing.

530
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,394
- So what? You're not hungry?
- Not really.

531
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:28,232
Sookie made you some grilled cheese
if you don't like pot roast.

532
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,275
Well, if I'd known that.

533
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,738
- Let me guess. You don't want to be here.
- Doesn't matter.

534
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,199
I mean, here in Stars Hollow.

535
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,283
Jeez, Miss Gilmore.

536
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,744
Why would anyone not want
to be here in Stars Hollow?

537
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,621
That just sounds plum crazy.

538
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:45,082
Jess, let me give you a little advice.

539
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,835
The whole
'my parents don't get me' thing...

540
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,753
- I've been there.
- You have?

541
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:53,423
Yes, I have. I've also done
the 'chip on my shoulder' bit.

542
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:57,302
The surly, sarcastic
'the world can bite my ass' bit.

543
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:00,681
And let me tell you, I mastered them all.
In heels, yet.

544
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,517
Everything you're feeling
might be totally justified.

545
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,310
Maybe you are getting screwed.

546
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:08,146
But Luke is a great guy.

547
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,315
He's very special.

548
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:14,695
And he really wants to take care of you
and make things right for you.

549
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,115
You're incredibly lucky to have him.

550
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,409
If you give this situation half a chance...

551
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,703
you might be surprised
at how good it can be.

552
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,454
How much you like living here...

553
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:28,876
how comfortable it feels to have someone
like Luke you can really depend on.

554
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:32,045
What? Are you sleeping with him
or something?

555
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:33,213
Excuse me?

556
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,631
The whole starry-eyed...

557
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:37,384
'you're so much better off,
just give it a chance' speech.

558
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,679
You're either really naive
or you're getting some.

559
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,807
There have been
very few moments in my life...

560
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,060
where I've actually wished
I had one of those enormous cream pies...

561
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:50,147
you can smash in someone's face.
This is definitely one of them.

562
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,690
Now that's not very neighborly.

563
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,650
You know what? This is my house.

564
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,819
I choose how I get talked to in it.

565
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:59,656
You don't know anything about me,
or my life, or my mom, or Luke.

566
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,825
So why don't you Dr. Laura someone else?

567
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,661
I'm going inside. Stay out of my fridge.

568
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:12,878
Where's Jess?

569
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,714
Outside working on his Breakfast Club
audition. He's good.

570
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,508
- What?
- I'm sorry.

571
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,010
That kid is way more screwed up
than you think he is.

572
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,179
- What?
- I catch him outside with a beer.

573
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:24,723
I don't even bust him on it.
I try talking to him.

574
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,934
What do you mean 'talk to him'?
What did you say?

575
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:30,521
I said he's got a good thing going here
with you and he shouldn't blow it.

576
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:31,813
Then he just got charming.

577
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:34,525
What are you doing
talking to him about stuff like that?

578
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,818
- I'm trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

579
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:37,903
You do.

580
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:40,906
Here we go again with this
I'm not prepared for this crap.

581
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,743
This is not crap. This is the truth.
You should've heard him talking.

582
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:46,328
I don't need to hear him talking.

583
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,330
He's my nephew
and I know what I'm doing...

584
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,707
and I'm getting tired
of your condescending...

585
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:54,086
- I'm not being condescending.
- You have a kid, so you know everything?

586
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,922
I have a kid,
so I know a little more than you do.

587
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,800
You ever think
maybe you just got lucky with Rory?

588
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,343
You did get pregnant at 16.

589
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:05,013
That doesn't show the greatest
decision-making skills, does it?

590
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,932
Two pies.

591
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,269
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm talking about nothing.

592
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:13,397
You won't have to hear my opinion
on anything ever again, okay?

593
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,566
- Don't tease.
- Go find Jess.

594
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,235
Don't tell me what to do.

595
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,993
- You're being completely childish.
- Am not.

596
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:29,329
We're never going to go into Luke's again?
We're just going to starve?

597
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,623
This was a bad one.
This was not Nick and Nora.

598
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,792
This was Sid and Nancy.
I'm not going in there.

599
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,627
The coffee is in there. It's Danish day.

600
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:39,256
Are you telling me you'll let a fight
get in the way of Danish day?

601
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,382
- No.
- Good.

602
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,759
Go in and order two coffees
and two Danishes to go.

603
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:43,969
You're kidding, right?

604
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,388
He's going to know what's going on.
He's not stupid.

605
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,808
He cannot prove that you're not ordering
all that for yourself, can he?

606
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,643
No, so go on.

607
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,229
Scoot. Mommy's right here.

608
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:04,031
I'll have two coffees
and two cherry Danishes to go, please.

609
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:07,117
- Two coffees and two cherry Danishes.
- And some napkins.

610
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:09,453
- One of these is for her, isn't it?
- Who?

611
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:13,457
No. They're all for me.
I am super hungry today.

612
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:16,835
I was debating ordering three,
but I'll tell you how I feel after two.

613
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,129
I'll give you one Danish
and one cup of coffee.

614
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,798
You can sit there and eat
and when you're finished...

615
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,634
I'll bring you a second one.

616
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:26,178
You're going to stand there
and watch me eat a Danish?

617
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,222
Cable's out. I'm starved for entertainment.

618
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,141
This is insane. So you guys had a fight.

619
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,560
Big deal. You know
you're going to make up anyway.

620
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:35,562
What better day to make up
than Danish day?

621
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:37,231
The happiest of all days.

622
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:39,816
The day when we all say,
'Let's forgive and forget...

623
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,777
'over a nice Danish and a cup of coffee. '

624
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,321
One Danish, one cup of coffee.
Take it or leave it.

625
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:45,864
I'll take it.

626
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,117
I still think you're being silly.

627
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,578
Thank you for sharing. Come back soon.

628
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,214
- Well?
- He would only sell me one.

629
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:05,509
- Didn't you say they were both for you?
- He knew I was lying.

630
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,804
Did you do the blinky thing?
You always do it when you're lying.

631
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:09,930
I didn't have to.

632
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,516
He knows that you're not going to go
a whole day...

633
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,810
with no coffee and especially no Danish.

634
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,229
Why don't you go in there now
and make up?

635
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,857
Why don't you give me
half your Danish and some coffee?

636
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:22,317
I'll give you the Danish
but I'm keeping the coffee.

637
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:23,902
What is a Danish without coffee?

638
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,737
The eternal question springs up again.

639
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,365
There's no point
in even eating a Danish without coffee.

640
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,742
- I'm going to school.
- Sad Danish. Lonely Danish.

641
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,953
- Step-Danish.
- I'll see you tonight.

642
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,417
Hey, kid.

643
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,836
Do me a favor? Come here.

644
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,093
Please?

645
00:32:57,436 --> 00:32:59,188
What is it, Taylor?

646
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,815
Slow down. You're babbling.

647
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,319
How do you know it was Jess?

648
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,906
Okay, Taylor. I'll talk to him.

649
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:11,825
But if he tells me he didn't do it
and nobody saw him do it...

650
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:14,119
then he is off the hook. Understand?

651
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,006
Hi.

652
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,134
- Am I too early? 'Cause I can...
- No.

653
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,345
...come back some other time.
- This is fine.

654
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,639
- Tomorrow, maybe.
- Now is good.

655
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,351
- This is weird.
- Yeah, it is.

656
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:40,812
- I don't really know how to act.
- I'm not sure of that myself.

657
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,650
- We could sit.
- Sit?

658
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,361
Sure, that's good. Barbara Walters sits.

659
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,446
Or walks, if the person she's talking to...

660
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,991
has a horse or a ranch
or a big backyard sometimes...

661
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,118
but usually she just sits.

662
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,249
I guess we should just start.

663
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:01,792
Good idea.

664
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,670
- Do you mind if I tape this?
- Not at all.

665
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:10,008
I guess I'll just dive in.

666
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:13,887
- Full name?
- Max Arturo Medina.

667
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,848
- You're kidding?
- No. I'm not.

668
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,017
- Where does that come from?
- My father's butcher was named Arturo.

669
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:21,436
- Really?
- When my mother was pregnant with me...

670
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,564
she would eat only lamb chops.

671
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:25,983
Arturo would cut her
the extra-large lamb chops...

672
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:28,443
and only charge her
for the regular-size lamb chops...

673
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:30,821
which in my family
made you eligible for sainthood.

674
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,906
- Hence the Arturo.
- That's right.

675
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,825
I assume that you are aware...

676
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:37,744
that you were voted
the students' favorite teacher last year.

677
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:40,372
I teach an exceptional bunch
of young people.

678
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:43,083
I'm glad they seem to like me
as much as I like them.

679
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:45,752
Have you thought of doing something
other than teaching?

680
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:48,463
My father wanted me to be a doctor...

681
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:51,049
and my mother wanted me
to be President.

682
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:53,927
I wanted to be a clown.

683
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,220
What?

684
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:57,097
When I was a kid, I went to the circus...

685
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:00,976
and I saw this man
who was dressed in this crazy outfit.

686
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:04,688
He could juggle and he rode
on an elephant and the people loved him.

687
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,232
I thought, 'That's it. That's for me. '

688
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,401
- How long did that last?
- Junior high.

689
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:12,029
And then slowly I figured out
that I wanted to teach.

690
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,865
Plus, when you told people
that you wanted to be a clown...

691
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,409
they tended to get very frightened.

692
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:21,163
Mom took me to the circus once
when I was really little...

693
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,082
and this clown knocked into me
and I dropped my cotton candy.

694
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,084
We didn't have a lot of money back then...

695
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:29,046
so she couldn't buy me another one
and I started crying.

696
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:32,007
She literally chased the clown onstage...

697
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,718
ripped off his wig
and said she wouldn't give it back...

698
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,387
- unless he bought me another candy.
- Which I bet he did.

699
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:40,224
It was twice as big
and I threw up all the way home.

700
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:41,391
Yeah.

701
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,353
That sounds like your mom.

702
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:48,482
Do you ever regret the fact
that you didn't become a clown?

703
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:50,359
I don't really believe in regrets.

704
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:54,363
All my experiences, even the ones that
didn't turn out the way I wanted them to...

705
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:57,157
I firmly believe they were all worth it.

706
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:05,958
I just want you to know...

707
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,044
I really wanted you to be my stepfather.

708
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,466
I just want you to know...

709
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,761
I really wanted to be your stepfather.

710
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:31,275
What would you say
are the great challenges...

711
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:34,862
- facing high school graduates today?
- A myriad of things, really.

712
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:44,246
- How was school?
- Great.

713
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,790
- You learn anything good?
- Yeah, tons of things.

714
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,960
I got gold stars
plastered all over my forehead.

715
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:52,129
I had an interesting call today.

716
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,298
- Want to know who it was from?
- Not really.

717
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,176
From Taylor Doose.
You know, he owns the market.

718
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,761
- If you say so.
- He said you came in today.

719
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:02,389
He said you took some money
out of a donation cup...

720
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,765
to help repair the bridge.

721
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,728
I told him he was crazy,
you wouldn't do that, you weren't a thief.

722
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:09,271
Then I hung up on him.

723
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,815
Don't get me wrong.
I enjoy hanging up on Taylor.

724
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,025
And he is crazy.

725
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:16,278
I was just wondering if maybe
any of the things he said were true.

726
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:17,404
What do you think?

727
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:20,282
If you tell me what he's saying
is not true, I'll believe it.

728
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,743
- It's not true.
- That doesn't sound very convincing.

729
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:24,495
What do you want from me?

730
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,705
You bring me here,
you put me in a school...

731
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:29,333
that says the Pledge of Allegiance
in six languages...

732
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,084
two of which I've never heard of!

733
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:34,046
You take me away from my home,
my friends, and now you want...

734
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:36,089
- what from me?
- I'm trying to help you!

735
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:37,174
Stop trying!

736
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:40,844
Stop talking to me, stop following me,
stop asking me questions! Just stop!

737
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,137
That's what you want?

738
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,764
- That's really what you want?
- Yes.

739
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:44,890
Fine! You got it!

740
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:47,059
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

741
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:01,240
Kitchen!

742
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:05,619
Nowhere in either Stars Hollow
or its surrounding counties...

743
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,996
can you get a decent cup of coffee.

744
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,917
I swear. It's like
a big, stupid coffee conspiracy.

745
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,169
Why don't you pour the water
right into the bag?

746
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:17,089
You jest? Believe me,
the thought has crossed my mind.

747
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,591
It's looking better all the time.

748
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,969
Where are you going?
I'm not through complaining.

749
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:23,971
I just have to get some more notes I need.

750
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:25,430
- What's this?
- What?

751
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,266
This that you're working on?

752
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:29,685
That's my interview with Max.

753
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:30,978
What interview with Max?

754
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:32,521
The paper wanted to do a piece...

755
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:35,190
on the students' favorite
teacher from the previous year.

756
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:37,901
Paris assigned it to me
when she caught wind of the fact...

757
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,987
- Nice kid, that Paris.
- Yeah.

758
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,948
It wasn't that bad, though.
It was actually good.

759
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,075
It gave us a chance
to talk about some things.

760
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,952
- Good.
- Yeah. It was good.

761
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:49,663
I'm going to buy a folder for it
before the store closes.

762
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:50,831
Okay.

763
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,043
Some good writing here, missy.

764
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:56,503
- Yeah?
- Really good.

765
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:59,882
It's not quite up to the repaving piece yet,
but I'll get it there.

766
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,092
Boy, he sounds like
a hell of a guy, doesn't he?

767
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,635
Yeah, he does.

768
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,641
I sure know how to dump them, don't I?

769
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:18,317
- I just pushed him in a lake.
- What?

770
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,904
I got this call from Taylor
that Jess stole the bridge money.

771
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,531
I went to confront him
and he was being impossible...

772
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:27,826
and I just pushed him in a lake.
This is bad.

773
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,622
- That depends. Can he swim?
- He's fine. He's wet. I lost it.

774
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:32,789
You were right.

775
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:36,168
I am in so far over my head
that I can't see my own hat.

776
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:37,503
Try turning it around.

777
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:40,005
What was I thinking?
Why did I say yes to this?

778
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:43,509
You saw a kid in need of help
and you thought you'd throw him a line.

779
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,677
But me? Raising a kid?
I don't even like kids.

780
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:48,514
They're always sticky,
like they've got jam on their hands.

781
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,307
Even if there's no jam in the house...

782
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,392
somehow they've always got
jam on their hands.

783
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:55,562
I'm not the guy to deal with it.
I have no patience for jam hands.

784
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:58,815
Okay, slow down. First of all, Jess is 17...

785
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:01,360
so he's probably past
the jam hands stage by now.

786
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:06,073
Second of all, you can do this.
If you want to, you are totally capable.

787
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,534
But you can't just buy a bed
and some sheets...

788
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:11,411
and expect the rest to take care of itself.
That won't work.

789
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:12,788
I swear, I'm going to kill Liz.

790
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:15,833
Liz is not the point anymore.
Liz is not here. Jess is here.

791
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:18,502
Focus on him.
What are you going to do about him?

792
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:21,547
Sugar, I hate to bother you,
but have you seen Pierpon?

793
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:24,341
- No. Why?
- It's the darnedest thing.

794
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:27,094
I came out just now
and I noticed that he was gone.

795
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,221
- Just like that.
- I'm sorry. Who's missing?

796
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:31,640
- Pierpon, gorgeous.
- Her gnome.

797
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:33,767
The one with the pipe.

798
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,978
Oh, God,
I hope nothing's happened to him.

799
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:37,980
You get so attached to their little faces...

800
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:40,315
sometimes you can hear them
talk to you at night.

801
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:42,359
You know, I wouldn't worry, Babbette.

802
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:45,445
I think you're going to see Pierpon again.
Really soon.

803
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:48,824
- Where are you going?
- I have to take care of something.

804
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,618
I'll see you tomorrow at the diner
for your Danish, right?

805
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,662
- Tomorrow isn't Danish day.
- Just be there.

806
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,122
Yes, sir.

807
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,172
Okay.

808
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:07,676
We got the patch,
the gum, hypnosis tapes...

809
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:10,804
Chinese herbs, self-help books...

810
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:14,766
and several pictures of diseased lungs
to hang on the fridge.

811
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,018
Pretty?

812
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,644
This is done.

813
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:21,648
You will get up, you will go to school,
you will come home.

814
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:24,985
You will work in the diner until closing,
you will do your homework...

815
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,029
then you will go to bed.
Where's the gnome?

816
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,071
What?

817
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,533
Weekends are for chores
and selected pre-approved outings...

818
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:35,162
i. e. Cabala studies,
freeway beautification projects...

819
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:39,625
Color Me Mine pottery painting,
all discussable options.

820
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:43,170
You will not steal.
You will pay back Taylor Doose...

821
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:47,382
you will graduate from high school,
and you will return Pierpon to his yard.

822
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,635
- You can't just...
- I can just.

823
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,095
I am not letting you
fall off the face of the earth.

824
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:56,183
You will not drift. I won't let it happen.
I don't know if this is the right way...

825
00:41:56,266 --> 00:42:00,521
but this is the way it's being handled
and that is the end of this discussion.

826
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,275
- Where are you going?
- Out.

827
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:08,278
At least I asked.

828
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,457
- Hey, yourself.
- What are you doing out here?

829
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,626
I needed something for school.
What about you?

830
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,169
Yeah, same thing.

831
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:29,091
So, that was quite a disappearing act
you pulled the other night.

832
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:31,844
Potlucks and Tupperware parties
aren't really my thing.

833
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:34,555
- Too cool for school?
- Yes, that is me.

834
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:37,266
- What are you doing?
- This?

835
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,018
Nothing.

836
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,856
Just another little disappearing act.

837
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:45,274
- Little tip?
- Yeah.

838
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,985
If you want to speak to me,
don't pull that out of my ear.

839
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,028
I assume the nose is off-limits, too.

840
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,072
Any place
you wouldn't naturally find a coin.

841
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:53,824
Let's leave it that way.

842
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:57,244
So what are you doing now?

843
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:59,454
- I have some homework to finish.
- Okay.

844
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:02,374
Then I'll leave you this last little trick.

845
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,502
You bought a copy?
I told you I'd lend you mine.

846
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,880
- It is yours.
- You stole my book.

847
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:09,173
No, borrowed it.

848
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:11,466
That's not called a trick,
that's called a felony.

849
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,677
I just wanted to put
some notes in the margins.

850
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:14,845
What?

851
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:23,020
- You've read this before.
- About 40 times.

852
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,897
I thought you said you didn't read much.

853
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,899
What is much?

854
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,319
- Goodnight, Rory.
- Goodnight, Dodger.

855
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:34,823
- Dodger?
- Figure it out.

856
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:38,494
Oliver Twist.

857
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:27,751
English
