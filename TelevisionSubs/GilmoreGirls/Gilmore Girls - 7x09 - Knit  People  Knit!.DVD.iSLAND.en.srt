1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:03,632
So, Lorelai couldn't have been more
than, what, 8 or 10 years old?

2
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:05,404
But she was very definite
about the whole thing.

3
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:08,271
She looked me directly in the eye,
and she said,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,319
"When I grow up,
I'm going to marry Tip O'Neill."

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:14,652
I swear to you,
I nearly had a heart attack.

6
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:17,604
I liked the name "Tip." I thought it
was cute, like a puppy or a bunny.

7
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:20,301
Anyway, I'm happy that
you two got married,

8
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,138
and quite relieved not to have
had Tip O'Neill as a son-in-law.

9
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:25,767
Here's to your marriage --

10
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:29,097
our heartfelt congratulations.
We also got you a little gift.

11
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:31,979
Oh, yes,
which is crying out to be opened.

12
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:34,342
It's just a little token to
commemorate the occasion.

13
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:35,668
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:37,480
I love the look of
this wrapping paper.

15
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,522
- To the happy couple...
- Oh, well, not the time.

16
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:42,258
- ...to Lorelai and Christopher.
- Hear, hear!

17
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:43,761
To Lorelai and Christopher.

18
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,921
Long may they live.
Okay, time to open?

19
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:47,550
Yes, Lorelai,
you may open your present.

20
00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:50,167
For heaven's sake,
you're like a dolphin at feeding time.

21
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:58,971
Wow.

22
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,979
I mean, d--

23
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:03,367
I -- it's -- it's like, "wow."

24
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:05,273
It's an etching by Kiki Smith.

25
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:07,325
It's extraordinary, this item.

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,341
- Wow.
- Wow, right?

27
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:09,514
It's called "Wolf Girl."

28
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,960
Baldwin, our dealer,
is a big fan of Kiki Smith.

29
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:13,521
She's all the rage in New York.

30
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:15,201
That was very generous of you.

31
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:16,263
It's our pleasure.

32
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,288
All couples should
cultivate an art collection.

33
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:20,791
Well, this is gonna start
our collection off...

34
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,432
with a bang.

35
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:25,921
I'm so happy you love it. We were
flying blind without a gift registry.

36
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:27,303
Well, you flew great, mom.

37
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,641
Of course, I imagine it's
difficult to have the forethought

38
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,463
to register when you
decide to suddenly elope.

39
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,098
Everything changes when a couple elopes,
doesn't it?

40
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:37,525
Nothing is done in quite
the traditional manner --

41
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,752
for instance,
informing your parents of your marriage

42
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,073
by leaving them a message
on their answering machine.

43
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:44,499
What? You told me
you told them.

44
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:46,120
I didn't say they were
home when I told them.

45
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:47,645
Mom, you're such a chicken.

46
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,698
You left a message
on their machine?

47
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,450
She certainly did.

48
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:54,855
I come home, and I push "play" on
the machine, and what do I hear

49
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,661
between a message
from Lily Margulies

50
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:58,933
about her fund-raiser
for tanzanian children

51
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:00,497
and one from my tennis pro,

52
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,856
but my very own
daughter telling me,

53
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:04,571
guess what -- she's married.

54
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,082
- Mom, I'm sorry. I just --
- Why just talk about it?

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,250
- Why not share it?
- No, no! Hey, hey!

56
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:12,608
Hey, just wanted you guys to know,
Christopher and I are back from Paris.

57
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:14,238
G.G.'s all set.

58
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:17,728
And, uh, we just ended up, uh...
getting married.

59
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,116
So, anyway,
see you friday. Bye!

60
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:21,375
Isn't that lovely?

61
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:22,993
Mom, erase that, please.

62
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,644
I most certainly will not.

63
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:27,024
Your father and I plan
to treasure it forever.

64
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:29,995
We're going to have it as
a keepsake or a memento.

65
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:32,690
"Remember when Lorelai
told us she was married?"

66
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:35,634
"Ah, yes, and what was
it exactly that she said?"

67
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:38,369
"I think it was
something like this."

68
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:41,773
Hey, just wanted you guys to know,
Christopher and I are back from Paris.

69
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:43,490
G.G.'s all set.

70
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:47,708
And, uh, we just ended up, uh...
getting married. So, anyway--

71
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:43,220
The lamb is delicious, Emily.

72
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,810
Who's being Mr. "Favorite
son-in-law happy smile face"?

73
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,286
I'm glad you're enjoying
it, Christopher.

74
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:49,072
My butcher had it flown
in from New Zealand.

75
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:51,065
-  First class, I hope.
- Well, the dinner is very nice.

76
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:51,718
It is.

77
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,568
It ought to be.
We have cause to celebrate.

78
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:55,736
Yes, we do.
Speaking of which, we have decided

79
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:58,038
that we would like to throw
you two a wedding party.

80
00:03:58,052 --> 00:03:59,842
- Oh, that's very sweet.
- Very sweet.

81
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:02,323
Very sweet, mom, but you know what --
it's totally unnecessary.

82
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,603
Look, you already gave us
"Wolf Girl," which, I mean, ah?

83
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:07,273
- How do you top that?
- We insist.

84
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,193
Dad, we're already married.
Isn't it too late?

85
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:11,578
No, but soon it will be.
We need to get on this right away.

86
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:14,074
We don't want it to look as if there's
anything to be ashamed of here.

87
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:16,557
If we don't throw a party,
who knows what people will think?

88
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,465
Why don't you give us
an anniversary party?

89
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,365
Like a 10th?
Wouldn't that be nice, honey?

90
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:23,645
I mean, what is 10 --
bronze, sandstone, particleboard?

91
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:24,804
Actually, it's tin.

92
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:26,070
But that's not for 10 years.

93
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,846
Giving you plenty of
time to plan. Tin?

94
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:28,937
Things just stick in my brain.

95
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:30,934
Lorelai, you ought to
celebrate your marriage.

96
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:33,367
We did. We did celebrate --
right after we got married,

97
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,777
we went out and had a beautiful meal,
didn't we?

98
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,976
We had a beautiful meal.

99
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,525
Yeah, we had a chocolate mousse and
a para liqueur and a cheese plate.

100
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:41,617
A cheese plate?

101
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:43,811
Since when is a hunk of
fermented milk a suitable means

102
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,819
- for celebrating a marriage?
- Look mom, we're good.

103
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:48,044
- Honestly, we're celebrated out.
- But what about us?

104
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:50,256
Hey, if you and dad want a party,
it's fine by me.

105
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,865
Buy some 40s, rent an inflatable
bounce house. That's great.

106
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,401
- Knock yourselves out.
- What about Rory?

107
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:55,390
What about Rory?

108
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:58,708
Rory, now tell me, don't you think this
marriage should be officially celebrated?

109
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:01,507
Well... yes, actually.

110
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:02,813
I think it would be nice.

111
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:03,733
C hristopher?

112
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:05,515
Well, I think it would be fun.

113
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,520
I'm not one to turn
down a free cocktail.

114
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,082
Lorelai?

115
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,753
Okay, then, let's celebrate.
Let's have a party.

116
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,532
Wonderful.

117
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:17,475
Now, if we book the Harbor Club,
we can't have more than 400.

118
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:20,687
So Lorelai, I'll need a list of your
people as soon as it's earthly possible --

119
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:21,522
you too, Christopher.

120
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,909
Well, I can give you my list right now.
It's me, Chris, Rory,

121
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,319
Logan --
if Rory wants him there --

122
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:26,748
Sookie, Jackson, and Michel.

123
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:27,497
That's it?

124
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:29,750
You can invite more people than that.
It's your day.

125
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:30,575
That's my list.

126
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:33,492
Why don't you invite some of your
charming Stars Hollow friends?

127
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:34,690
That's okay, mom.

128
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:37,202
We can make it black-tie optional,
if that will help.

129
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:39,103
It's not because they
don't have black ties.

130
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:41,232
Suit yourself.
Now, what do you think --

131
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:44,386
a string quartet, or something more fun,
like a swing band?

132
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,010
My god, woman,
is there a book you don't own?

133
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:50,390
I'm so sorry.

134
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,537
I think I may have
re-activated my scoliosis.

135
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,099
Suck  it up, people.
That was the last of it.

136
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:55,243
So much for one trip, huh?

137
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:57,159
Well, who knew I had nine
trips' worth of stuff?

138
00:05:57,192 --> 00:06:00,747
Your place is so big, it made my
stuff look small and inconsequential.

139
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:02,204
Did I mention I'm so sorry?

140
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,635
Two copies of "The
Norton Anthology"?

141
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:05,611
They were gifts.
I can't get rid of gifts.

142
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:08,143
Okay, looks like all that's left
to do now is the paperwork.

143
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:09,626
- Paperwork?
- The lease.

144
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,798
- You want me to sign a lease?
- Well you are subletting from me and

145
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,893
the last time you lived here, you just
up and left in the middle of the year.

146
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,439
Um, you kicked me out.

147
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:17,539
You moved all my stuff out in
the hallway and locked the door.

148
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,217
Well, now you'll have a
legally binding contract

149
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,432
that will negate my ability
to do that in the future.

150
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,054
All right. What does it say?

151
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,143
Standard boiler-plate stuff --
just sign here and here.

152
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:30,901
And initial here and here.

153
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,339
Okay. What is this?

154
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:35,338
"Rights and privileges of Logan
Huntzberger or any other paramours"?

155
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:37,767
If Logan is going to be
spending an enormous amount of time here,

156
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:40,567
it's only fair to assess a daily
tariff for water and power use.

157
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,358
- Paris!
- It's a very simple formula,

158
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:44,442
based on the number of nights he
spends per month at the apartment,

159
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:47,184
times the approximate minutes per day he
spends showering, brushing his teeth,

160
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:49,896
and/or surfing the internet.
And sunday is no charge.

161
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:51,423
It's okay. I'll kick in, Paris.

162
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,073
Thataboy, Rockefeller.

163
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:54,330
- All right.
- Okay.

164
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:55,834
- Welcome back to the hood.
- Thanks.

165
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,886
- It's good to have you back, Rory.
- Oh, thanks, Doyle.

166
00:06:57,922 --> 00:06:59,842
- All right, I better take off.
- Oh, no.

167
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:02,404
You just got here,
and we spent the whole time moving.

168
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:03,823
Why don't you come
in on thursday?

169
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,155
I've got to wine-and-dine some clients,
but you should join us, it'll be fun.

170
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:08,734
We'll rack up an obscene bill at
Nobu and charge it all to my dad.

171
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:11,055
I can't.
It's Lucy's 21st birthday on thursday.

172
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,523
We're throwing her a big party.

173
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:13,941
I was hoping you
might be able to come.

174
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,053
I can't -- Nobu.

175
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,961
Nobu, schmobu.
It's a college party.

176
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,388
Don't you miss college parties?
Our theme's 2002.

177
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:20,913
- Why?
- Just because.

178
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:22,564
- What's your theme?
- Contracts.

179
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,160
Boring. 2002's so much better.

180
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,963
Just bring your clients,
and we'll let them tap the keg.

181
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,270
- Right.
- Come on.

182
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,749
It's a 2002 party, right?
In 2002, you were a college freshman.

183
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,631
You would have been
bored by businessmen

184
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:36,202
and thrilled to go to a party
thrown by hot senior girls.

185
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:38,003
It's all very tempting,
but I have to go.

186
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:38,925
- I know.
- I love you.

187
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:39,923
Love you, too.

188
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,044
I'll put you down for
half a day, Logan.

189
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,586
Good morning.

190
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,475
Well, good morning,
madame Defarge.

191
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:51,668
Good morning, Mr. "I remember stuff
from english class in high school."

192
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,203
Can I ask how long this Mr.
"Long sentence

193
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,028
of words strung together"
thing is gonna last?

194
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,741
I'm not sure, Mr.
"Doesn't understand

195
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:59,103
the more annoying you tell me a bit is,
the more I want to do it."

196
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,578
Look at you, knitting away,
just like a proper married lady,

197
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:03,342
the picture of domesticity.

198
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,400
So what's for breakfast, Martha Stewart?
Poached eggs? Blueberry muffins?

199
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:07,953
Oh, is there gonna be
fresh-squeezed orange juice?

200
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,852
'Cause I'd really appreciate it
if you could strain the pulp.

201
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:11,954
Yeah, I got your strained
pulp right here, buddy.

202
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:13,266
So what exactly
are you knitting?

203
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:14,849
It doesn't matter
what I'm knitting.

204
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,143
I'm knitting just to knit.

205
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:17,246
Someone's philosophical.

206
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,558
No, someone is in training
for the knitathon.

207
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,475
And we get pledged
by the skein,

208
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:22,897
so I'm just working
on my speed.

209
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,315
-  "Knitathon"?
- Yeah.

210
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,630
You didn't hear
about the knitathon?

211
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:27,970
I did not hear about the knitathon.
Do you want something?

212
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,443
Yeah. Poached eggs and
some orange-juice pulp.

213
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:31,941
- How about coffee?
- Sold.

214
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:34,615
So, we are holding a knitathon
the day after tomorrow

215
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:37,119
to raise money to rebuild
the old muddy river bridge.

216
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,020
What's wrong with the bridge?

217
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:40,658
Well, we rebuilt it a couple years ago,
but now it's started to rot.

218
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,019
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

219
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:43,833
It's too bad, too,
'cause it was gorgeous.

220
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:45,326
We all loved, loved, loved it.

221
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:47,880
It was sturdy and strong, made out
of these beautiful japanese maple --

222
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:51,186
which it turnes out is exactly the
kind of wood that attracts beetles,

223
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,258
and I'm not talking
british-invasion kind of beatles.

224
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm talking the kind of
beetles that like to eat wood.

225
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:58,571
So now we're gonna make it
out of a less-delicious wood.

226
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:00,220
Ah. So, how goes the training?

227
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:01,832
Are your fingers getting
strong and muscly?

228
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:04,057
My fingers are fine.
It's these needles.

229
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,282
I keep dropping stitches
'cause they're slippery.

230
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,529
I need nonslip needles.

231
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:08,928
Do they make nonslip needles?

232
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:10,418
I don't know.
You know what, I'm gonna go into town

233
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,894
and see if anyone's
selling them.

234
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:13,878
- Oh yeah ? I'll come with.
- That's okay.

235
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:15,250
No, no. I could use some air.

236
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,206
Yeah, but I have
errands to run.

237
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:18,837
Plus I got to go to
the dry cleaner's.

238
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,986
So?

239
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:22,588
So I don't want to subject you
to Lizzie the crazy dry cleaner.

240
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:24,401
It's very intense, you know.
She starts complaining about --

241
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,693
Why don't you want me to
come into town with you?

242
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:29,539
Oh. Well, you know...

243
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:32,234
I just want to give people...
time to adjust.

244
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:34,181
- To?
- To you and me.

245
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:37,012
I mean, I just want to be sensitive,
you know?

246
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,323
You're not who they expected,
and I--

247
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:42,611
I just don't want the marriage
to seem sudden, you know.

248
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,510
I-I want to kind of
ease them into it.

249
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:47,339
Is that why you didn't want to invite
any of your friends to your mother's party?

250
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:50,995
No. Well, yeah, but 90% of it
was I didn't want them to have

251
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,620
to deal with salsa dancing and
the peabodys and the sandborns.

252
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,076
But I guess 10% is I
didn't want to feel like

253
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:57,993
I'm shoving our marriage
down their throats.

254
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,664
By inviting them to a party?

255
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,048
So soon. I just don't want it to
seem like we're flaunting, you know.

256
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,562
I want to give them
time to adjust.

257
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:07,180
They're not gonna adjust
if they never see me.

258
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,140
Yeah. You're right.

259
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,032
Come on.
Let's go for a stroll.

260
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,966
Okay, but a stroll.
Not a strut.

261
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:15,180
Yes, I promise I will keep my
chicken-walking to an absolute minimum.

262
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:17,691
- How long is this gonna go on?
- Couple more days.

263
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:20,321
It's ridiculous already.
Somebody's gonna poke an eye out.

264
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:21,508
You're just bumming
'cause April's gone.

265
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:23,401
First, get your hand
off my shoulder.

266
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:25,605
Second, I'm not bumming,
and April is not gone.

267
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:27,550
She just went back to
living with her mother.

268
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,653
I'm just saying,
I'm feeling you, Luke.

269
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,067
- Luke.
- T.J.

270
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,081
- I need a drink.
- We don't serve alcohol.

271
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,950
Well, then,
anything that's carbonated.

272
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:39,751
If I drink fast enough,
bubbles tend to have the same effect.

273
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,517
What are you doing here?
Is Liz okay?

274
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:43,299
She's gonna have a
baby at any moment.

275
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:45,208
- It's not good, Luke.
- What?

276
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:46,971
We're having a
baby at our house.

277
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:50,060
We talked about this.
You're gonna be a great dad, T.J.

278
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:53,147
No. You don't understand. We're having
a baby at our house any minute now.

279
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:56,114
Liz wants to have our
baby in our living room!

280
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:57,905
What? Why?
What about a hospital?

281
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,156
She won't go! She's got it in her head
that this should be done at home.

282
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:03,938
My sister is gonna
have her baby at home?

283
00:11:03,952 --> 00:11:06,155
She got the idea from --
phew! -- Marcy Hedges,

284
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,762
who plays the midwife at
the renaissance festivals.

285
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:11,361
Only Marcy has five kids --

286
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:13,327
all born in hospitals --

287
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:16,375
and now she's telling Liz
how amazing and natural it is

288
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,643
for her to do it at home.

289
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:18,708
This  is crazy.

290
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,314
Liz said she had Jess at a hospital,
and she wants to have this one at home.

291
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:25,276
She has this birth coach,
called a doula.

292
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,868
That's not her real name.

293
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:28,577
Don't call her that.
She's very touchy.

294
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:29,545
Her real name is Sandy.

295
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:30,944
Okay. Sandy the doula.

296
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,168
Anyway, Sandy's done about
200 of these home births,

297
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:37,896
and she says statistically, they're
every bit as safe as hospital births.

298
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,244
I can't believe she's
having her baby at home.

299
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:45,531
Anyway, she wants you to
be there at the birth.

300
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:47,785
She wants the baby to
be born around family.

301
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,723
So I promised I'd
get you to come.

302
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:51,124
Of course, sure. I'll be there.

303
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:52,975
Just call me whenever,
and I'll come right by.

304
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,112
Great. Thanks, Luke.

305
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,321
That feels good.

306
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:01,901
Yeah, all right,
I'll see you later, T.J.

307
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:03,512
Just let me know when
the water breaks.

308
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:05,190
Go take care of her, all right?

309
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:06,776
- All right.
- See you, man.

310
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:23,702
That's it! All right,
this diner is now a knit-free zone!

311
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:26,148
Stop knitting or
get the hell out!

312
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,627
..yarn around,
new loop through, old loop up.

313
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,261
Needle in, yarn around,
new loop through, old loop up.

314
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:36,670
Keep a gentle tension
on the strand!

315
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:38,204
Humongous needle!

316
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,631
Careful! Just because
it's decorative

317
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:42,922
doesn't mean it's not sharp!

318
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:44,448
- I don't like root beer.
- No?

319
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:46,184
Not without carbonation.
You want it?

320
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,004
- Your used dum dum?
- It's not used. It's vintage.

321
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:50,299
It was nice of Lizzie, though.

322
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,926
Dude, 15 minutes of
perchloroethylene talk?

323
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:54,919
We earned those dum
dums fair and square.

324
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:57,396
All right, knit and purl,
like brick and mortar!

325
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,332
- Hey, Babette!
- Oh, hey!

326
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:01,481
Keep going with the
rib stitch there.

327
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:02,756
How are you, sweetheart?

328
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,811
Hey, Christopher.

329
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:04,808
How you doing, Babette?

330
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:07,005
Congratulations on the
getting-married thing.

331
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,459
I'd give you a hug,
but my hands are kind of full here.

332
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:10,908
- So, you eloped.
- Yeah.

333
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:12,596
We were in Paris,
and we eloped.

334
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,510
That's smart, eloping. Smart.

335
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,678
Who needs the hassle
of a real wedding, you know?

336
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:18,629
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

337
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:20,632
All the planning and the fuss,
so much stress.

338
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:21,438
Exactly.

339
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:24,190
Plus the dress.
I mean, why would anyone want to buy

340
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:27,258
a big, expensive wedding dress
you could only wear once?

341
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,751
Except for me.
I got to wear mine twice.

342
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,389
But once was for Halloween.
I was the bride of Chucky.

343
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:33,706
Oh, yeah?
Did Morey go as Chucky?

344
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:36,621
Huh?! No,
he was a futuristic pirate!

345
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:38,923
So, welcome to Stars Hollow!

346
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:40,617
Thank you.
It's good to be here.

347
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:42,260
Knit and purl!

348
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:44,514
Lorelai, Christopher,
there you are.

349
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:45,405
Hey, Patty.

350
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,188
I'm sorry I didn't get
this to you sooner.

351
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,249
Part of my job as
town social chair

352
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:52,271
is greeting all newlyweds with
the Stars Hollow welcome wagon.

353
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:54,074
Look at all this.
Thank you so much.

354
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:57,180
Just a few odds and ends from our
town merchants to say "welcome."

355
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:59,886
This is so cool. I didn't know the
welcome wagon came in a real wagon.

356
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,998
Yeah.

357
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:03,242
Well... so there you go.

358
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:05,121
- Oh, terrific. Thank you.
- Thank you, Patty.

359
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:07,961
So, how are you adjusting to
Stars Hollow, Christopher?

360
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:09,313
Oh, it's terrific.

361
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:11,393
I'd bet you're bored
senseless here.

362
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:12,844
No, no. Not at all.

363
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:15,893
There's hardly any nightlife.
I mean, a worldly guy like you

364
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:17,599
must feel like he's
out in the sticks.

365
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:20,437
Well, my discothequing
days are mostly behind me.

366
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:23,077
Anyway, I probably should run.
Enjoy the wagon.

367
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:24,821
- Thank you.
- Bye, Patty.

368
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:27,104
You want a ride?

369
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:28,630
No. That's okay.

370
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,679
- Hey.
- Hi.

371
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,511
Um, I have some 2002
paraphernalia here.

372
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:45,729
Okay.

373
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:48,173
Are Lucy and Olivia home?

374
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:49,497
No.

375
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,155
'Cause they said to
bring this stuff by.

376
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:53,994
Do you know when
they'll be back?

377
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,041
No.

378
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,547
Do you know where they went?

379
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:57,868
- Just down the hall.
- Rory!

380
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,632
- Yay! Rory's here!
- Oh, hey, guys.

381
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,271
- You brought stuff.
- As promised.

382
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:04,632
- Let's see.
- Boyfriend.

383
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,176
Nice poster work.

384
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:08,362
I went with double-sided
tape rather than thumbtacks.

385
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:09,904
I think it gives
it a cleaner look.

386
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,313
I think you're right.
Plus, double-sided tape is so 2002.

387
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,423
- You're a genius.
- You're my inspiration.

388
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,907
- You brought J.Lo?
- Of course.

389
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,649
- And I have boots.
- Oh, my god, so did we!

390
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:22,477
We are gonna ugg-ugg!

391
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,742
My  feet were so much more
comfortable in 2002.

392
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:25,749
What do you think, boyfriend?

393
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:27,150
Very Clydesdale.

394
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:29,845
Hey, compliments only from
boyfriends on birthdays.

395
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:32,002
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

396
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:36,345
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey, Anna.

397
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:38,196
- How's April doing?
- She's doing great.

398
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,586
I'm pretty sure as of friday,
she had shown her appendix scar

399
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,473
to every one of her teachers and
classmates. She's quite proud of it.

400
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,669
I'm just glad she's doing good.

401
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:45,593
Yeah, me too.

402
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:47,826
Um, can we talk in private?

403
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,092
Sure. Come on up.

404
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:50,520
Caesar, I'll be back!

405
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,816
Oh, the place looks nice.

406
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:55,976
April's handiwork.

407
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:58,510
Right. She told me -- cerulean.

408
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,451
So, um... my mom --

409
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:03,690
Yeah. How's she doing?

410
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:04,984
Still recovering.

411
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,605
I think I have her
care all worked out,

412
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:10,288
but it is an ongoing rubik's cube
of day, night, and weekend nurses.

413
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,351
That's tough.

414
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:13,750
Yeah, especially being on the
other side of the country.

415
00:16:13,762 --> 00:16:15,553
And she's really lonely.

416
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:17,970
I thought about
moving her up here.

417
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:20,729
But she's been living in
that house for 42 years,

418
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,237
and I just feel like
it would be cruel.

419
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:25,392
Yeah. Say,
April can stay with me any time.

420
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:26,936
Whatever you need.

421
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:28,527
Luke...

422
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:31,559
I've decided that April and I
are gonna move to New Mexico.

423
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:33,794
Oh. Really? Wow.

424
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,623
Yeah, I-I'm sorry,
but my mother is all alone.

425
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:40,488
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, it's, uh... wow.

426
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:42,634
But it's where I grew up,
so I know the area.

427
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,199
They have a lot of
really good schools.

428
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,261
Does April know?

429
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:49,991
- I told her last night.
- How's -- I mean...

430
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,708
is she okay with it?

431
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,022
Well, she's not thrilled.

432
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:54,863
It'll take some
getting used to, but...

433
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:56,954
So, when? How soon?

434
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:58,429
As soon as possible.

435
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:01,155
Tina, my assistant manager,
is gonna run the business for me.

436
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:03,119
I've already been
looking online at houses,

437
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:04,720
found a nice
little neighborhood.

438
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:08,500
And I just --
I wanted to, you know, let you know.

439
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:12,155
Yeah. Hey, uh, I guess you got to
do what you got to do, you know.

440
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,888
I mean, when my dad was sick...

441
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,363
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

442
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:19,385
I should go.

443
00:17:19,754 --> 00:17:22,080
- I have some things.
- Sure. Sure.

444
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,438
Yeah.

445
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,022
Drat you,
you dratted spaghetti,

446
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:37,287
you slippery, slithery,
uncooperative --

447
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,869
- Am I interrupting something?
- No.

448
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:42,062
Seriously, if you and spaghetti need
privacy, I can come back later.

449
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:44,318
In the middle of the night last night,
I woke up with an idea.

450
00:17:44,348 --> 00:17:45,256
Yeah?

451
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,010
For days,
I've been trying to figure out

452
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:48,929
what to serve at my
knitathon booth, right?

453
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:52,189
So, it's 2:00 a.m.
Flash! I have a vision.

454
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:55,422
Balls of yarn made
out of spaghetti,

455
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:57,830
with breadsticks stuck in the middle,
like knitting needles.

456
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,322
It's brilliant!
Brilliant! Horrible!

457
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,709
Not that appetizing. Why don't
you just make regular spaghetti?

458
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:04,360
'Cause that's not theme-y.

459
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:07,524
Why are you in early? I thought
you were not coming in till late.

460
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,499
Well, I was,
but I had some paperwork and...

461
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:10,346
And, um...

462
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,052
Christopher and I just
walked through town.

463
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:12,945
And?

464
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:14,381
Everyone was very cordial.

465
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:15,621
Ooh. Cordial?

466
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:18,392
Yes. They said hello.
They shook his hand.

467
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,097
They welcomed him
to Stars Hollow.

468
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:21,307
Jeez, really? Cordial?

469
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:24,088
Yes. Creepy, right?
I saw miss Patty and Babette.

470
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:25,479
Neither one of them
pinched his butt.

471
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,186
Well, honey,
you married an outsider.

472
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:28,058
I know.

473
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:29,918
We just --
we all thought you and Luke...

474
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:32,222
I knew people thought me and Luke.
I thought me and Luke.

475
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,398
But it's not me and Luke.
It's me and Christopher.

476
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,177
I know. It's just --
people really loved you and Luke.

477
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:39,126
Right. But it's not their life.
It's my life.

478
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,868
And frankly, I don't see why I
should have to go around feeling bad

479
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:44,294
that my life didn't turn out
the way everybody wanted it to.

480
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,027
- I know--
- I'm sick of it. I really am.

481
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,994
And, look,
I understand that you liked Luke

482
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,134
and you're not so sure
about Christopher,

483
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,060
but, Sookie,
you're my best friend.

484
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:55,053
I really need your
support here.

485
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:57,300
I mean,
Christopher is my husband,

486
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:59,983
and it would be great if
you would just get on board.

487
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,279
- Okay.
- Okay?

488
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:03,255
Yeah, I'm on board.
What do you need?

489
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,996
I'll swab the deck, I'll hoist
the sail -- anything nautical.

490
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,612
Okay, I need you to help me get
the rest of the town on board.

491
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:11,072
- Okay.
- Okay. What do we do?

492
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:13,105
- We need a campaign.
- Right. A campaign.

493
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,541
Oh, he could walk Paul
Anka around town.

494
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,205
Cute guy, cute dog --
very appealing.

495
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,401
Paul Anka's not good with sidewalks --
sensitive paws.

496
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,521
He could pull him in the
welcome wagon -- or Jackson.

497
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,220
You want him to pull
Jackson around on a wagon?

498
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:26,147
No, maybe he and Jackson
could do something together.

499
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:27,711
You know,
Jackson's got a lot of clout.

500
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:29,399
If people see that
Jackson likes Christopher,

501
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:30,923
then maybe they'll
like Christopher.

502
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,449
You think Jackson's
got a lot of clout?

503
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,518
Jackson has tons of clout.
He's lousy with clout.

504
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,321
Okay. What should they do?

505
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:37,905
Something where
they'll be seen.

506
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,920
Ooh, how about a movie?

507
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:40,004
- Too dark.
- Yeah. Yeah.

508
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,003
Pancakes at Al's?

509
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,298
Jackson is off of wheat.

510
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:44,512
But, ooh, how about
country night at miss Patty's?

511
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:45,568
Chris and Jackson?

512
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,703
Well, I mean, Jackson is a fiendish
two-stepper, but he's handsy.

513
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,268
- What do regular guys do?
- Grunt?

514
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,735
- Scratch?
- Leave the toilet seat up?

515
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:52,999
- Talk about sports?
- Talk about cars?

516
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:54,113
- Burp?
- Beer!

517
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,790
- Drink beer.
- At Casey's!

518
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:57,171
- Perfect.
- Oh, like manly.

519
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:58,312
- Simple.
- Ooh!

520
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:01,258
And while they're scratching and grunting,
we can actually go do something fun.

521
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,057
- Country night at miss Patty's.
- Mm-hmm. Hee-haw.

522
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:06,580
So, what are you up for tonight?
I was thinking we could

523
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,403
rent "A brief history
of time" again.

524
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,147
Maybe I'll understand something
more than the credits this time.

525
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,048
Sure.

526
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,799
Look... your mom told
me you were moving.

527
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,053
- To New Mexico.
- Yes, it's not so bad.

528
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,240
You've been there visiting
your grandma before, right?

529
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:21,082
I don't want to
move to the desert!

530
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,585
It's just--
there aren't even any seasons!

531
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,925
It's hot,
and it's a miserable place,

532
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:26,719
- and I hate it!
- Let's take a walk.

533
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,591
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

534
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,384
Look, I know you're
a little upset,

535
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,013
but this could be a
really good thing --

536
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,823
I mean, the new people you'll meet,
the teachers you'll impress.

537
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,287
- I'll never see my friends again.
- Of course you will --

538
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,283
Breaks from school
over the summer.

539
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,149
No, Janie Freedman moved to
Virginia at the end of last year

540
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,686
'cause her dad got
some teaching job.

541
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,383
And she said she'd stay
in touch with everybody,

542
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:46,600
and she did for like a week.

543
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:48,471
And then after that,
nobody ever heard from her again.

544
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:49,440
It doesn't have
to be like that.

545
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:51,695
We're moving 2,000 miles away!
That's how it's gonna work!

546
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:54,214
- Mom is ruining my life!
- April.

547
00:20:54,231 --> 00:20:57,245
I'm finally happy.
I finally have friends.

548
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:59,655
It took me forever,
and now I'm just gonna be

549
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:03,203
that weird,
dorky loser girl all over again!

550
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:06,108
I know. Come on.
It's gonna be fine.

551
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:09,120
- I don't get it.
- What?

552
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:10,846
- 2002 party.
- It's a theme.

553
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:11,784
How is that a theme?

554
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,783
It's just supposed to be funny.

555
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,798
- I'm not laughing.
- Well, you don't have to go.

556
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:16,099
Why not 2001?

557
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:17,357
It could be 2001, I guess.

558
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,749
"Space odyssey" --
that's a theme.

559
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,754
People dress up like
astronauts or apes.

560
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:22,093
I don't know what
to tell you, Paris.

561
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:24,118
- Will there be dancing?
- Yes, it will be dancing.

562
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:25,089
What kind of dancing?

563
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:26,649
I don't know. 2002 dancing?

564
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:27,848
So we're talking
mostly hip-hop.

565
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:29,518
Paris, you don't have to
hip-hop-dance at this party.

566
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:31,552
I can hip-hop-dance.
Don't you worry.

567
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:33,344
Doyle and I will be
scorching the floorboards.

568
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,822
Looking forward to that.

569
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,750
- Hi, mom.
- So what are you gonna pledge me?

570
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:38,474
- In the knitathon?
- Yeah, what do you say?

571
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,517
- Like 10 bucks a skein?
- How about $5?

572
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:41,802
- So, $15?
- Make it $3.

573
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:43,365
- $20 a skein?
- A buck 50.

574
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,044
- 25 smackeroos?
- 75 cents.

575
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,473
We have no idea how to haggle,
do we?

576
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:49,016
No idea. Why don't you just
put me down for $30 even?

577
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:51,020
I will not take less than $30,
and then you got a done deal.

578
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:52,083
The best I can do is $30.

579
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:53,591
All right, you give me $30,
and it's a deal.

580
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,950
Do I have to pledge dad, too?

581
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,233
No, no, he's just a spectator.
Although, you know what he's doing?

582
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:58,901
He's going on a
man-date with Jackson.

583
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,532
Cute. A mandated man-date?

584
00:22:00,548 --> 00:22:02,846
Yes, it was
suggested enthusiastically.

585
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:04,454
What is that you're
listening to?

586
00:22:04,471 --> 00:22:07,428
That's Paris. She and Doyle are
threatening to scorch the floorboards

587
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:08,944
at Lucy's party.

588
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,480
Aw. Poor floorboards.

589
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:12,693
Hey, how did all
the party prep go?

590
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:15,292
Good. We're just about ready
to party like it's 2002.

591
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:17,874
There's just one thing though --
this whole Marty debacle.

592
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:19,714
It's just so annoying
to be around him.

593
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:21,632
Is he still acting
all cold and weird?

594
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:23,598
Beyond cold and beyond weird.

595
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:26,676
You're a hard one to get over, kid,
you know. He probably just feels bad.

596
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:28,872
When guys feel rejected,
they act all cold and weird.

597
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:32,287
Yeah, but I rejected him,
if that's even what happened, years ago.

598
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:35,221
I mean, isn't there a statute of
limitations for being a jerk?

599
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:37,455
Marty just probably
feels awkward.

600
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:38,865
Maybe you should
try to be nice.

601
00:22:38,881 --> 00:22:40,353
He's not exactly
being nice to me.

602
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:42,078
Well, you have to be
the bigger person.

603
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,479
Why doesn't he be
the bigger person?

604
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:45,810
Because you're 11 feet tall
and he's a mere mortal.

605
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,133
I hate being 11 feet tall.

606
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:49,615
I know.
It's hell finding jeans that fit, huh?

607
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:52,408
I got to go.
I got a man-date fashion disaster.

608
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:53,522
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

609
00:22:53,554 --> 00:22:55,277
So, uh, $30 a skein?

610
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:57,250
- Total -- $30 total.
- Yeah.

611
00:22:57,264 --> 00:22:58,305
Hey.

612
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,157
W-What?

613
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,367
Is that what you're wearing?

614
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,815
What? What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?

615
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:04,471
Nothing. It's just
that it's, um...

616
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:06,131
- What?
- ...black.

617
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:07,725
- It's a black shirt.
- Yeah.

618
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:08,866
Okay, then.

619
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:12,144
It's very Joaquin
Phoenix at the Oscars.

620
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,034
I have no clue what that means.

621
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:15,158
It's very fitted.

622
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:16,411
I should wear a shirt
that doesn't fit?

623
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:17,370
No.

624
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:19,519
- Should I tuck it in?
- No!

625
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:21,503
Why are you grimacing
at this shirt?!

626
00:23:21,518 --> 00:23:23,422
Um... I don't know.

627
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:26,215
Maybe it's not the best thing to
wear on your man-date with Jackson.

628
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:28,715
Okay, first of all,
if you say "man-date" one more time,

629
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,433
there is no way in hell
I am leaving this house.

630
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:34,040
And second, last I knew, I was about
to go and have a beer with a farmer.

631
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,834
I don't think it really
matters what I'm wearing.

632
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:38,239
Oh, it is very important that
you make a good impression.

633
00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:40,168
Lor, come on,
how great did our walk through town go?

634
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:42,116
You were all worried about that,
and everybody was nice.

635
00:23:42,147 --> 00:23:43,823
- They were nice.
- It went great.

636
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:45,260
- Eh.
- Didn't it?

637
00:23:45,274 --> 00:23:46,584
- Nah.
- What are you saying?

638
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:50,007
I'm saying it didn't go so great.
They were cordial, they were polite.

639
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:50,909
But the wagon...

640
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:54,075
Was full of cleaning
supplies and shoe trees.

641
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,077
When Claude and Michael
Davies got married,

642
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:59,138
they got handmade clothing
and homemade baked goods,

643
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:02,359
and the pizza guy
whittled them bookends

644
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:04,279
in the shape of
senegalese tigers.

645
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:05,764
That's a welcome wagon.

646
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,700
We got a "we're tolerating
that you're here" wagon.

647
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:09,745
Sorry.

648
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:12,525
So, going out with Jackson
is important because...?

649
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,862
Jackson is loved.
Jackson is respected.

650
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:18,404
If you're in with Jackson,
you're in with Stars Hollow.

651
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:20,686
Okay, maybe I could wear
the gray polo shirt.

652
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,605
I love that idea!

653
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:24,955
- What about the jeans?
- They're fine.

654
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:26,162
They're just a little tight.

655
00:24:26,177 --> 00:24:28,262
All right,
I'll change the jeans.

656
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,483
The shoes?

657
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:32,127
All right, I'll change the shoes.
I hate to say this out loud,

658
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:35,302
but all of a sudden, I'm very nervous
about my man-date with a farmer.

659
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:37,779
You're gonna be great.

660
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:40,903
Not too much stuff in the hair!

661
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,620
So, what do you think?

662
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:46,987
I'm down with any place where you can
throw your peanut shells on the floor.

663
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:49,001
Not exactly a
Manhattan hot spot.

664
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:51,889
A beer in Stars Hollow tastes
just as good as a beer in Soho,

665
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:53,172
and it's a hell
of a lot cheaper.

666
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:54,380
It's a Microbrew.

667
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,128
They brew it right
here on the premises.

668
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:05,438
So, what's your best crop?
Do you have a favorite?

669
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:07,384
Don't get me started.
I love them all.

670
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:09,705
But it has been a
standout eggplant year.

671
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:11,444
- Do you like eggplant?
- Yep.

672
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:14,100
Don't say another word.
I am your eggplant connection.

673
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,514
Guess I'm gonna have to get
rid of my other guy, then.

674
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:21,100
It's just -- it's just a joke.

675
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:23,775
Oh. Yeah.

676
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:36,109
- So, you and Lorelai, huh?
- Yeah.

677
00:25:36,124 --> 00:25:39,312
That's quite an achievement. I mean,
many have tried, many have failed.

678
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,105
Yeah, I feel pretty lucky.

679
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:51,280
You know what I love about farming?
The commitment.

680
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:53,689
No shortcuts, no quitting.

681
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:55,547
You have got to be
there for your crops

682
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:57,025
morning, noon, and night.

683
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,470
I mean, you can have the
greatest soil and perfect seeds,

684
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:03,165
but if you are not
100% committed,

685
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,466
you might as well pave
over those 32 acres

686
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,777
and build yourself a strip mall.
You know what I mean?

687
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,234
It's a lot of responsibility.

688
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,894
It sure is.

689
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:12,925
It sounds like you
really love farming.

690
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:13,981
I do.

691
00:26:14,035 --> 00:26:15,939
Sookie and I, we both do.

692
00:26:16,268 --> 00:26:17,617
Me too.

693
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,360
Yeahn okay. If you want to come by,
I'll be in all afternoon.

694
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,333
Great. I'll see you then. Bye.

695
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:27,762
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.

696
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:29,536
Sure. What's up?

697
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:32,214
Well, April --
she's pretty upset.

698
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:33,544
Yeah, I know.

699
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,144
I wanted to make sure we were
doing everything we could

700
00:26:36,158 --> 00:26:38,581
to make it as easy as,
you know, it could be for her.

701
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:40,796
- So, what have you got in mind?
- Okay, well, I was thinking.

702
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:42,983
Instead of pulling her out in
the middle of the school year,

703
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:46,732
maybe you could wait to move
till the end of the school year?

704
00:26:46,746 --> 00:26:48,316
And you don't think
I thought about that.

705
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:50,424
No, you could go back and forth,
and still be there for your mom,

706
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,073
and I could help
covering for April here.

707
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:56,286
No, I have to be out there full
time as soon as possible, Luke.

708
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:58,787
Oh, well, she could stay
with me to finish the year.

709
00:26:58,803 --> 00:27:01,319
She's already been with me
for two months, you know?

710
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:02,997
I'd love it.
It would be great, actually.

711
00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:05,329
Luke, I know you mean well,
but that's not gonna happen, okay?

712
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:08,292
I'm not splitting apart
from April for six months.

713
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:10,480
No, I understand.

714
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:14,009
Okay, so, maybe, you know,
we could buy her some plane tickets

715
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:17,420
so she'll know she's going
back and forth and when?

716
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:19,006
We can't make that plan now.

717
00:27:19,018 --> 00:27:20,978
No, it doesn't have to
include everything.

718
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:23,693
But, like, I already told
her she could stay with me

719
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,680
for spring break
and part of the summer, so if --

720
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:27,816
Whoa. You told her that?

721
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,814
- You actually said that?
- Yeah.

722
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:32,074
I have no idea what
we'll be doing then.

723
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:32,880
I just assumed that --

724
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,182
You have no right making
promises to my daughter.

725
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,143
I just wanted her--

726
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:39,172
I don't want you talking to her
about this again. Are we clear?

727
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:40,582
- Anna.
- No, Luke.

728
00:27:40,597 --> 00:27:42,288
Listen, these are my decisions.

729
00:27:42,305 --> 00:27:44,351
I'm not gonna have you
going behind my back,

730
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:46,796
making promises to
April that I can't keep.

731
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:49,569
So, are you saying
she's not coming back?

732
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:52,428
I am saying I'm not
ready to make decisions.

733
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,621
And they are my decisions to make,
not yours, Luke.

734
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,374
Now I'm gonna go.

735
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:03,600
Hello?

736
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:07,485
It's showtime, Luke!

737
00:28:07,498 --> 00:28:09,707
What the hell's going on over there?
Is Liz okay?

738
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:11,082
She's amazing!

739
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:13,220
We're having a baby, baby!

740
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,531
It's beautiful!
You got to get over here.

741
00:28:15,738 --> 00:28:17,295
I'm on my way!

742
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:35,920
Free needles.
Free for everyone.

743
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:48,146
Free needles! Free needles!

744
00:28:48,163 --> 00:28:50,219
See? Who says Stars
Hollow's not progressive?

745
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:51,473
- Hey.
- Hey, you guys.

746
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:53,210
- Yummy.
- Hey, Jackson. What's up?

747
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:56,184
Hey. How's it going? So wednesday
night -- we still on to watch the game?

748
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,132
Sounds good.

749
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:59,244
All right, we're gonna stake out
some prime knitting real estate.

750
00:28:59,277 --> 00:28:59,722
See you later.

751
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:01,258
- Save us a spot!
- We will.

752
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,514
You're seeing Jackson
wednesday, huh?

753
00:29:02,546 --> 00:29:03,654
Yeah, we were thinking maybe.

754
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:05,104
- I guess that could work.
- What do you mean?

755
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:07,298
- I have some other plans for you.
- Plans?

756
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,398
Yeah, you got bird-watching with Morey,
darts with Andrew.

757
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:12,393
Ooh, and Glenn Belkin wanted
to have coffee with you.

758
00:29:12,424 --> 00:29:15,039
He is the head coach of the
peewee little league teams.

759
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,209
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

760
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:18,818
He think he might have a plum
assistant-coaching job for you.

761
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:20,388
Assistant coach, huh?

762
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:22,289
All right, I'm feeling the
knitting vibes right here.

763
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:23,853
Hello, hello!

764
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:26,325
Hiya, kids.
Boy, it's a chilly one, huh?

765
00:29:26,342 --> 00:29:28,418
Welcome, fair citizens
of Stars Hollow.

766
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:30,998
We come together on this
glorious autumnal day

767
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:34,307
to rescue our beloved
muddy river bridge.

768
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:38,956
And the knitting will commence
at precisely 10:00 a.m.,

769
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:41,921
and we will knit unceasingly
until our long day's journey ends

770
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:43,983
at the stroke of 10:00 p.m.

771
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:45,690
Taylor, 10:00 a.m.
is 40 seconds away.

772
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:48,060
What? No.
I've got 3 1/2 more minutes.

773
00:29:48,073 --> 00:29:50,581
I've timed this speech to
last exactly 3 1/2 minutes.

774
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:55,606
Um, a bridge is not merely a feat
of engineering and architecture.

775
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:57,101
A bridge is also a metaphor.

776
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:59,241
Taylor, I'm sorry.
Your watch is wrong.

777
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:02,599
I have precise atomic clock time.
28 seconds.

778
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,574
I'm with Kirk! 26 seconds!

779
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:05,858
But I just got this watch.

780
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:08,046
- Make that 22, 21.
- 20.

781
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,316
As I was saying, a bridge is a metaphor,
a meeting place between here and there,

782
00:30:11,328 --> 00:30:15,170
between the past and the future.
The Golden Gate, the Brooklyn...

783
00:30:15,183 --> 00:30:16,857
to raise funds...

784
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:19,514
- our duty as citizens!
- Nine seconds!

785
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:22,036
Real-time accounting
of the funds approved.

786
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,738
Seven seconds!

787
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,071
- As we strive toward --
- Six!

788
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:28,119
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

789
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:30,562
Oh, fine! Go ahead and knit!

790
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,674
Thank you! Thanks so much.

791
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:40,912
- Hey.
- Hi.

792
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:43,080
How are you enjoying
your first legal drink?

793
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,421
Third, actually.

794
00:30:44,436 --> 00:30:48,182
I like it, although I kind
of miss being a lawbreaker.

795
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:51,211
Oh, my god. It's Paris Geller.

796
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:53,696
- I told you.
- You totally delivered.

797
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:54,780
Who's the dude?

798
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:55,949
That's her boyfriend -- Doyle.

799
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:58,048
- I'm fascinated.
- Go talk to her.

800
00:30:58,129 --> 00:30:59,824
- Really?
- Yes, it's your party.

801
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:00,466
How do I look?

802
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:02,384
You look tiara'ed,
21, and fabulous.

803
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:06,921
Hi! Thank you for
coming to my party.

804
00:31:13,678 --> 00:31:17,219
Barkeep, I'll have an upside-down
tequila slammer with a twist.

805
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,244
I don't know how to make that.

806
00:31:19,565 --> 00:31:21,353
Yeah, I just made it up.

807
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,043
Really? Is this the
way it's gonna be?

808
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:29,083
I say something, and you grunt
and make me feel like an idiot?

809
00:31:29,098 --> 00:31:30,262
Really? That's it?

810
00:31:30,326 --> 00:31:31,520
What do you want me to say?

811
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:33,216
Well, what I would
like you to say

812
00:31:33,232 --> 00:31:35,154
is that you've put me in a
really difficult position,

813
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:37,724
and the least you can do
is not be a jerk about it.

814
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:38,846
I'm sorry.

815
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:39,853
Yeah?

816
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:40,937
Yeah.

817
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:42,905
So you're done being a jerk?

818
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,274
Y-Yeah, I-I'm done.

819
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,137
Good.

820
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:48,169
So you still want that
upside-down tequila slammer?

821
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:49,876
- With a twist.
- Right.

822
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:51,888
- Probably has tequila in it.
- Yeah.

823
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:55,641
Um, the upside-down part,
I'll have to improvise.

824
00:31:55,655 --> 00:31:59,532
But the slammer and the twist
are pretty straightforward.

825
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:01,181
You might want to stand back.

826
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:02,102
Oh, okay.

827
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:08,664
Go, Paris! Go, Paris!
Go, Paris!

828
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,291
Go, Paris! Go, Paris!

829
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:17,025
Shh! It's okay, sweet girl.

830
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,000
Y-You sure about
the name "Doula"?

831
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:21,800
She's such a Doula.
Isn't that right, gorgeous?

832
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,441
- It's cute, right?
- Yeah, no no.

833
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,727
What's that, Doula?

834
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,577
I want my uncle
Luke to hold me.

835
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,269
Oh, no, no, no. You keep her.

836
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:31,851
Please! Uncle Lukey!

837
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,377
- No, really.
- Come on, Luke.

838
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:35,028
I-I don't have to.

839
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,733
I want my uncle
Lukey to hold me!

840
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:38,345
Okay. Okay.

841
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:40,226
- Here you go, Doula.
- Here we go.

842
00:32:40,576 --> 00:32:42,604
- Look at her.
- Hey, Doula.

843
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:45,719
Isn't she beautiful? Look at her eyes.
She's got Liz's eyes.

844
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:47,015
It's true.

845
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,879
And --
and aunt Sissy's chin, right?

846
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:53,460
- That's totally Sissy's chin.
- No, Sissy was adopted.

847
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:55,118
- So?
- So.

848
00:32:56,084 --> 00:33:00,604
Well, I-I don't know how she does it,
but she's got her chin.

849
00:33:02,738 --> 00:33:04,451
What do you think, Luke?

850
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:06,186
She's great.

851
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:08,547
That's your uncle Luke.

852
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:11,279
And Luke's daughter
is your cousin April.

853
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:14,001
Now, I bet April is gonna be
your number-one babysitter.

854
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:15,615
Am I right, Luke?

855
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:17,706
Yeah. Sure.

856
00:33:17,717 --> 00:33:21,539
$2,200! Not bad, people!
Not good, exactly, but not bad.

857
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:24,888
And we have seven more hours to make
up the rest, so keep on knitting!

858
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,410
And as you do,
think of the bridge!

859
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:28,716
Who wants coffee?

860
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:30,000
Is that a rhetorical question?

861
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:31,334
Thank you, Christopher.

862
00:33:31,347 --> 00:33:32,904
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

863
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:34,143
Not without doping.

864
00:33:34,156 --> 00:33:36,233
You guys don't talk like that!
Think of the bridge.

865
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,323
We'll never be able to look it in
the I-bar again if you let it down.

866
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,446
How's it going?

867
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,044
Well, I can't tell if my
hands are cramping or numb,

868
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:45,710
but they just keep knitting. So I
guess I'm trying not to think about it,

869
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:48,066
although I guess, right now,
I am thinking about it.

870
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,697
Maybe scheduling an
outdoor event in november

871
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,212
wasn't such a great move.

872
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:54,485
It was a great move --
a Fred-and-Ginger-type move.

873
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,114
It's just a brisk fall day.

874
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:57,800
Nah, it's a bad move,

875
00:33:57,817 --> 00:34:00,766
but it's part of a great
tradition of bad moves by Taylor.

876
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:02,944
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

877
00:34:02,956 --> 00:34:08,006
I just received a
donation of $7,800!

878
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:10,776
Thanks very much to Stars
Hollow's newest resident,

879
00:34:10,793 --> 00:34:14,250
Christopher Hayden, for bringing
us up to our goal of $10,000!

880
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:14,835
Honey?

881
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:16,225
Christopher, you did that?

882
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,616
Yeah. Well, yeah, I --

883
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,990
Well, tha-- thank you.
Uh, i-it was really...

884
00:34:21,004 --> 00:34:23,225
Generous. It's generous, right?

885
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:24,369
Yeah, generous.

886
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,449
Thanks, Christopher.

887
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:26,987
You're welcome.
I just figured --

888
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:28,204
So what?
Do we stop knitting now?

889
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:29,554
Okay, pack it up, people.

890
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:31,175
I guess we stop knitting now.

891
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:33,995
We've reached our goal.
Our work is done here.

892
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,902
If we get that llama back in the next
half-hour, we're gonna save a bundle.

893
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,175
Wait, you guys, what are you doing?
W-Why are you leaving?

894
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:40,202
Well, you heard Taylor.

895
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:42,341
Yeah, but nobody ever listens to Taylor.
Come on, we got to keep knitting.

896
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,249
- It's seven more hours.
- What's the point?!

897
00:34:44,261 --> 00:34:46,081
The point is, it's fun.
It's a festival.

898
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:48,863
We haven't even got rowdy. we haven't
even wrapped Taylor in yarn yet.

899
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:50,934
- Like a big Taylor cozy.
- Yeah.

900
00:34:50,947 --> 00:34:54,020
But we already got all the money.
So, thanks very much, Christopher.

901
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:54,933
You're welcome.

902
00:34:54,948 --> 00:34:56,091
Gypsy?

903
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:58,012
7,800 buckaroos.

904
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:00,570
Wow. You must really love
bridges, Christopher.

905
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:01,685
What are you doing?

906
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,197
I'm gonna go catch a movie.

907
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:06,621
Wait a minute.
Where is your Stars Hollow spirit, huh?

908
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,961
Where's the love of knitting
just for knitting's sake?

909
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:10,294
At the movies?

910
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:12,002
- Sorry, honey.
- Yeah.

911
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,489
I wonder what's playing.

912
00:35:13,504 --> 00:35:15,550
I don't know, but I'll bet
it's nice and toasty in there.

913
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,739
Thanks again, Christopher.

914
00:35:16,754 --> 00:35:18,774
Sure. Happy to help.

915
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:22,523
Okay, let's get those needles down!
And careful, there, fellas!

916
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,400
Just because they're decorative
doesn't mean they're not sharp.

917
00:35:34,326 --> 00:35:36,192
How is she still dancing?

918
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:36,989
Paris?

919
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:38,310
No -- Lucy.

920
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:39,683
Paris I understand,

921
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:42,808
'cause Paris has been training for
this like it's an olympic event.

922
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:45,053
But Lucy?
Lucy weighs 11 pounds,

923
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:47,087
and I'm pretty sure most
of that is tequila by now.

924
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,764
The girl loves to move.

925
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:51,709
Oh, buzz-cut boys
going through.

926
00:35:51,723 --> 00:35:54,013
Mmm! I'm going in.
I've got time for one or two

927
00:35:54,024 --> 00:35:56,062
more awkward interactions
before the night is through.

928
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:57,175
Nice.

929
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,866
The bar is closed!

930
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:02,932
You finally quit.

931
00:36:02,946 --> 00:36:04,532
Nope, just ran out of booze.

932
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,190
I think I drank most of it.

933
00:36:06,204 --> 00:36:10,230
That upside twisted slammer
was living up to its name, man.

934
00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:12,069
I don't know if I'm more
twisted or slammed.

935
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:14,514
I'm both.
I think I had three of them.

936
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:16,252
Or was it four?

937
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:17,758
You know,
the last time I saw you drunk,

938
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:20,089
you were passed out and
naked outside my dorm room.

939
00:36:20,103 --> 00:36:24,057
So, the truth comes out
after all these years.

940
00:36:24,072 --> 00:36:26,610
- You checked me out.
- I did not.

941
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:29,429
- It was uncomfortable and weird.
- Well, it's for the best.

942
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:31,549
I was quite the
scrawny freshman.

943
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:34,032
I think I actually
weighed 98 pounds.

944
00:36:34,045 --> 00:36:36,219
But, you know, now...

945
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:38,415
- You've been working out.
- Can't you tell?

946
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:41,725
I'm huge. I'm massive.
I'm Marty Schwarzenegger.

947
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:43,978
I can tell.
You're looking good.

948
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:46,260
And you are more
beautiful than ever.

949
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,773
Um, you should be
out there with Lucy.

950
00:37:04,495 --> 00:37:05,633
Hi!

951
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:14,407
Why should I feel bad that I donated
$7,000 to help save the bridge?

952
00:37:14,422 --> 00:37:15,175
You shouldn't.

953
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:18,101
I don't. I thought the point
was to save the bridge.

954
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:21,216
Well, the point was to
save it with knitting.

955
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:22,809
- That doesn't make any --
- I know it doesn't make any sense.

956
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,515
That's Stars Hollow.
That's just how it is.

957
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,137
It's hard for outsiders
to understand.

958
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:27,681
So I'm an outsider?

959
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:28,928
For now.

960
00:37:28,943 --> 00:37:30,337
I thought I was
doing a good thing.

961
00:37:30,353 --> 00:37:33,004
I know. You just don't have to
drop all that money like that.

962
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:35,669
- I know I don't have to.
- You don't have to try so hard

963
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:37,481
to get people to like you.
What?

964
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:38,824
- That's funny.
- Why?

965
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:40,524
'Cause you're the one who's
making me try so hard.

966
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:42,458
Bird-watching,
backgammon, darts,

967
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:44,446
assistant-managing a
peewee baseball team?

968
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,482
I just want --

969
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:47,208
I know.
You want people to like me.

970
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:49,075
You know what?
I'm a likable guy.

971
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:52,913
I always have been. I may not be the
smartest guy or the toughest guy,

972
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:54,305
but I'm the guy
that people like.

973
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,272
You are?

974
00:37:55,288 --> 00:37:58,062
And you know why people in
Stars Hollow are gonna like me?

975
00:37:58,077 --> 00:37:58,752
Why?

976
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:00,642
Because I love you.

977
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,857
And I'm gonna be here,
loving you.

978
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,902
- You are?
- You bet.

979
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,683
You know, when you're a farmer,

980
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:08,794
you got to be there
for your crops.

981
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:10,712
It's not about the
seeds or the soil.

982
00:38:10,728 --> 00:38:12,495
It's about being there,
being committed,

983
00:38:12,512 --> 00:38:14,874
all day, every day, forever.

984
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,764
- Farmer, huh?
- Why not?

985
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:18,875
You know what, Mr.
"Doesn't seem like he knows

986
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:20,755
what he's talking about but
is actually pretty wise"?

987
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:24,658
What's that, Mrs. "Goes through 500
emotions every hour of the day"?

988
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,306
I love you a lot.

989
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:29,003
Yeah, you're okay, too.

990
00:38:47,112 --> 00:38:48,478
- Hey.
- Hey.

991
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:51,530
- April's not here.
- I know.

992
00:38:51,544 --> 00:38:54,100
She's sleeping at
Gabrielle Wilder's tonight.

993
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,865
So, what's up?

994
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:58,482
I also know that Gabrielle
has a peanut allergy,

995
00:38:58,497 --> 00:39:00,143
and before I drop her off,

996
00:39:00,157 --> 00:39:02,992
I check that April isn't
packing a snickers bar.

997
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:05,751
I also know that she likes
Gabby's coin collection,

998
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:08,523
so I thought I might take her
over to a coin shop in Stamford,

999
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:10,278
'cause she'd like it.

1000
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:11,650
What are you doing here, Luke?

1001
00:39:11,665 --> 00:39:14,747
You know, you're always telling me that
I can't do this with your daughter

1002
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:16,387
and that I can't do that
with your daughter.

1003
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:19,035
Well, she's not just
your daughter, Anna.

1004
00:39:19,048 --> 00:39:20,232
She's my daughter, too.

1005
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:22,160
- Luke --
- No. No.

1006
00:39:22,174 --> 00:39:24,444
I know I wasn't around
for all those years.

1007
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:26,380
But, you know,
that was your decision.

1008
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:27,879
That was your choice, Anna.

1009
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:29,786
And, frankly,
it was a damn lousy one.

1010
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,211
Okay, I didn't get to see her
born or take her first steps

1011
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:35,762
or take her to her first
day of school -- none of it.

1012
00:39:36,189 --> 00:39:38,886
And I can never get any of that back.
It's gone!

1013
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:43,070
But that's not gonna happen anymore.
That, I can guarantee you.

1014
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,705
- What are you saying?
- That she's my kid, all right?

1015
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:48,153
She's our kid.
She's not just yours.

1016
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,202
And I'm not gonna let
you treat me this way.

1017
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:53,618
I'm her father.
God, why do I even have to say that?

1018
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:57,184
I mean, April and I,
we have this relationship, okay?

1019
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:59,631
A-And you can't
just decide things.

1020
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:01,692
That's not how
this works, okay?

1021
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:04,944
I mean, we have to make decisions
together, decisions about April.

1022
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,748
And I will fight you.

1023
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,911
I will fight you for that,
Anna, if I have to.

1024
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:11,581
I have rights.

1025
00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:15,072
I'm her father,
and I have rights.
