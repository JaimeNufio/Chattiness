1
00:00:00,686 --> 00:00:02,967
Okay, I got a meeting in half an hour,
so I better run.

2
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:04,281
Okay, well, have a great day.

3
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:05,888
- Thanks again for breakfast.
- My pleasure.

4
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:07,263
You make a hell of a frittata.

5
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,365
Well, it's ma specialty.
What time will you be home?

6
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,550
Around 6:00-ish.

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,279
All right,
I might make a frittata for dinner.

8
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:13,413
Ooh, sounds good.

9
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:15,511
- Have a great day, honey.
- Bye, hon.

10
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:18,290
- So what'd you think?
- Frittata?

11
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:20,307
- Felt pretty good, huh?
- No, it did.

12
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:22,135
It's homey.
Home-ish. Home-like.

13
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:23,376
Margaret, what did you think?

14
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,263
You seemed like real
people in a real house.

15
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:27,001
Wow. What about the lighting?

16
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:30,501
Well, you can see there's lots of
windows, lots of natural sunlight.

17
00:00:30,517 --> 00:00:32,172
- But how do we look?
- Excuse me?

18
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:33,633
In the lighting,
how do we look?

19
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:36,420
Oh, right.
At least 10 years younger.

20
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,003
- Than...
- Hmm?

21
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:41,010
Well, if you think we're 60 and
the lighting makes us look 50,

22
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:43,791
then this room is aging us,
and that's not good.

23
00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:45,780
- You look 20.
- Very good!

24
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,301
This house was
originally built in 1790

25
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,731
but obviously has been
completely remodeled.

26
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:53,081
All new appliances.
three fireplaces.

27
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:55,583
Proximity to an excellent
school district.

28
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:58,522
The large backyard.
Great tree-house-building trees.

29
00:00:58,538 --> 00:00:59,450
Ooh, fun.

30
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:01,150
So I'm gonna make a quick call.

31
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,853
Take your time. Look around.
Make yourselves at home.

32
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:06,212
Well, I don't have to
tell you two that.

33
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:08,711
I'll be right outside, so just
holler if you have any questions.

34
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:10,223
Thank you. We will.

35
00:01:10,297 --> 00:01:12,100
- So...
- So?

36
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:14,351
- I told you it was a really cool house.
- It is.

37
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,272
- And that yard?
- Oh, love the yard.

38
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,992
And I know it's not Stars Hollow,
but it's a really cool town.

39
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:21,172
And bigger.
Lots of places to eat and shop.

40
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:23,721
Three bookstores?
I mean, this is a well-read community.

41
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:25,221
We might be the
dumbest people in town.

42
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:27,760
Yeah, we could be the town dunces.
We'll buy caps.

43
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:29,632
We'll put "The Dunces"
on our mailbox.

44
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:30,691
That mailbox!

45
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:32,882
What is that,
a hollowed-out birch tree or something?

46
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:35,103
The second-floor bedroom --
that's perfect for G.G.

47
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:37,142
And the third-floor room,
the one with the really cool windows --

48
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:38,232
that could be Rory's room.

49
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:40,451
Honey, I can't imagine
a better house.

50
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:45,121
Big front yard.

51
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,250
Could be our front yard.

52
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:49,570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:53,272
What's with the face?

54
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:55,951
Face? What face? It's my face.
You don't like my face?

55
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:58,003
- Lor.
- Hmm?

56
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,501
You want to stay
in Stars Hollow.

57
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:02,581
Yeah.

58
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,953
You want to stay in your house.
You don't want to move at all.

59
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:07,313
Yeah.

60
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,030
Okay.

61
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,783
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

62
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,872
- It's a hell of a mailbox, though.
- Sure is.

63
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:14,093
- You're here.
- I'm here!

64
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:16,131
You're 37 minutes late,
but you're here.

65
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:17,330
Uh, traffic.

66
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:19,351
It's sunday morning, Lorelai.
The roads are empty.

67
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,012
Will you let me finish, mom?
Traffic cones everywhere.

68
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:24,401
I mean, you wouldn't believe it. It's
like a crazy obstacle course out there.

69
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,751
It's a miracle I survived.

70
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:27,192
Maybe we should do
this another day

71
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,211
when I'm less stressed from
the traffic-cone dodging.

72
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:31,233
I have the most exciting news.

73
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:32,542
You're  canceling
my wedding party?

74
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:35,171
I got Randall Farber
as your party planner.

75
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,520
He's canceling my
wedding party?

76
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:39,091
He spent the last 15 years
as designer-in-residence

77
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:40,470
at the Connecticut Opera House.

78
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:41,142
Boss.

79
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:43,151
This is a real coup, Lorelai.

80
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,301
Your father and I have been
fans of his work for years,

81
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,490
and he's only just
begun designing parties.

82
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:50,780
Two months ago, we went to Abigail
Hirschfeld's granddaughter's bat mitzvah,

83
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,351
and it was the most
spectacular event.

84
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:57,080
The whole decor was inspired by
Britten's "A Midsummer Night's Dream."

85
00:03:57,095 --> 00:04:00,852
I swear I felt like I was in an
enchanted forest the entire night,

86
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,972
except for the children
running around with braces.

87
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:05,441
Randall, this is my
daughter, Lorelai.

88
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,731
Lorelai, Randall Farber.

89
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:09,760
- Hello.
- Ah, the star of our show.

90
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:10,901
Oh, well...

91
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,653
I apologize for her tardiness.
It's rather habitual.

92
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:15,313
Oh, stop.
You're talking to an opera man.

93
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:16,983
I've worked with Renï¿½e Fleming.

94
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:19,042
The personality of a pit bull,
that one,

95
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,493
but all is forgiven when she sings,
am I right?

96
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:24,262
Well, heads-up, I'm not much of
an outside-the-shower singer.

97
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:27,222
I hope you realize how lucky you
are to have Randall, Lorelai.

98
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:29,423
- He's a genius.
- Oh, stop.

99
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,370
Shall we?

100
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:31,543
Please.

101
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:34,532
The first order of business
is deciding on a theme

102
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,952
around which I can
design the evening.

103
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,841
How about "Man's
inhumanity to man"?

104
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:41,132
It always worked well for my
term papers in high school.

105
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:42,491
Why don't you show us
what you're thinking?

106
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:45,120
I've done a few mock-up tables.
Just tell me which one

107
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,892
- jumps out at you.
- Um, they all jump out at me.

108
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:49,601
- Kind of aggressively.
- Lorelai.

109
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:51,900
Well, I just don't want it
to be a big production, mom.

110
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:52,833
It's just a party.

111
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:55,220
My dear,
every party's a production.

112
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:57,211
If it's a lousy production,
it's a lousy party

113
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:59,021
and everyone leaves by 8:30.

114
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,801
What about that as a theme?

115
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,733
"Everyone leaves by 8:30."

116
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:04,373
Tell me about this one.

117
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:08,141
You've got your stoking plant,
your festive ornament collage,

118
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:10,631
your snowman trio,
your peekaboo Santa.

119
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:13,353
Well, it's lovely, Kirk,
but I already bought my wrapping paper

120
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:15,453
from the kids from the
Stars Hollow middle school.

121
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,412
- Well, then, you got ripped off.
- What?

122
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:18,742
Those kids are gouging you.

123
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:21,462
I'm selling the same
wrapping paper for 20% less.

124
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:22,922
Aren't the kids selling
the wrapping paper

125
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:25,041
to help raise money
for a new gymnasium?

126
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,522
- Yeah.
- Well, why are you?

127
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,311
To raise money for myself. 

128
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:31,112
I'm not a school, Luke.
No one's raising money for me.

129
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:33,802
I saw the opportunity to enter
the market at a lower price point

130
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:36,052
- and I took it.
- Ho, ho, ho.

131
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:39,131
What, schoolchildren are the only
ones allowed to sell wrapping paper?

132
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:40,293
It's a free country.

133
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,943
Hey, Jacob! Beat it.
This is my territory.

134
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:43,893
Fathead.

135
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:45,832
Yeah,  keep walking.

136
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,462
- Look who's here.
- Oh, my god!

137
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:52,023
She's  precious.

138
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:55,833
Oh, those eyes, that skin --
she's gorgeous.

139
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:57,690
That's what everyone says.

140
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,493
- Hey, Liz.
- Hi, Luke.

141
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:00,780
Oh, she's bigger.

142
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,310
- 11 pounds, 4 ounces.
- She looks great.

143
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:05,090
I know.
She's really strong, too.

144
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:07,257
She can practically
hold her head up.

145
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,125
Most kids don't do that
until they're two months.

146
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:09,956
- Really?
- Yeah.

147
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,021
- Come on over and sit down.
- Oh, sure.

148
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:17,282
She's really strong, too.
She takes after T.J.

149
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:19,053
He's really strong, you know.

150
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:21,123
We've been watching "Survivor"
sometimes, you know,

151
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,441
and he does the challenges,
you know,

152
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:27,091
like standing on one leg or
dragging the sandbags around,

153
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:29,422
and he lasts longer than
the guys on the show.

154
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:30,053
Wow.

155
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:32,192
You know,
baby's first Christmas is approaching.

156
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:36,121
Have you given thought to what baby's
first Christmas gift will be wrapped in?

157
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:36,961
No.

158
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:40,530
I have baby Santa,
cuddly reindeers, Frosty's world --

159
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:41,543
Kirk.

160
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:42,960
Yeah, okay.

161
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:46,283
So is April excited
about being a cousin?

162
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:47,833
Yeah. I showed her
the pictures you sent

163
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:50,590
and she's gonna frame the one
of her in the orange jumper.

164
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:52,831
Oh, that is such a good one!

165
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:55,242
She looks like a
little creamsicle.

166
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:58,392
- She's very photogenic, huh?
- Yeah.

167
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,121
And how are things with Anna?

168
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:02,422
We're trading calls.
It'll work out.

169
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:05,233
I mean, I've calmed down
a little since the fight.

170
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:07,472
It'll all work itself out.

171
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:08,503
I'm sure.

172
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:11,063
Actually, I made a list.

173
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:13,383
I think it's pretty reasonable.

174
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:17,590
I was thinking I could have April
either Thanksgiving or Christmas --

175
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:18,813
Anna can choose.

176
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:20,160
One month of the summer.

177
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:23,192
And I think I would like
April to come to Stars Hollow

178
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,122
one weekend every other month.

179
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:27,632
In between,
I can travel to New Mexico.

180
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,003
That sounds fair, right?

181
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:30,313
Very reasonable.

182
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:32,680
But I definitely think
you need to get a lawyer.

183
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:33,842
No lawyers.

184
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:36,113
Anna and I are gonna work
this out on our own.

185
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:38,853
That's what you think now,
big brother, but trust me --

186
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:41,022
custody issues are tough.

187
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:42,881
Well, I don't like lawyers.

188
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,411
Well, nobody does.

189
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:47,662
Wait. She's staring at you.
She is!

190
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:51,761
She's staring at you,
and she's falling asleep.

191
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:54,472
Great. I'm gonna
leave her with you,

192
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:56,481
and I'll be back in an hour.

193
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:59,040
- What?
- Oh, I'm going crazy.

194
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:01,450
- I just need a minute to myself.
- Liz...

195
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,502
She's been attached to
my boob for two weeks,

196
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:06,511
and T.J.'s decided to
finally get a "work ethic."

197
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,291
You can't just leave her here.
I can't watch her.

198
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:10,113
I fed her. She'll be fine.

199
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:11,491
She'll sleep the whole time.

200
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:13,442
- Wait, Liz --
- I'll be back in an hour,

201
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:14,810
maybe an hour and a half.

202
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:23,883
So why don't we take
our inspiration from

203
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:26,781
the world of "La Bohï¿½me,"

204
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,733
fin de siï¿½cle Paris?

205
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:32,542
A little birdie told me you had quite
the romantic parisian adventure.

206
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:33,743
Tweet, tweet.

207
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:36,792
I must confess --
this is my personal favorite.

208
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:38,582
I must admit I
have a soft spot,

209
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:41,642
for it was while I was doing "La
Bohï¿½me" at the Staatsoper in Vienna

210
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:44,650
that I met the incomparable
Franco Zeffirelli,

211
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:47,002
whose meticulous
attention to detail

212
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:49,650
has been a yardstick for
which I measure all my work.

213
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,363
Your details are simply
astounding, Randall.

214
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:55,251
What about instead of "La Bohï¿½me," we
took our inspiration from "Rent" --

215
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,323
East Village, 1985,

216
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:59,993
rickety tables,
chipped glassware...

217
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,973
- Lorelai.
- Excuse me.

218
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:03,070
Hello?

219
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:04,523
How goes the party planning?

220
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,723
What? What happened?

221
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:09,122
- That good, huh?
- Is he okay?

222
00:09:09,138 --> 00:09:10,872
I'm not participating in this.

223
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,533
Oh, my god. What can I do?
What do you need?

224
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:16,173
You're not using this phone call
to get out of party-planning hell.

225
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,053
Oh, I'll be right there.

226
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:18,911
Mom!

227
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,883
I can hear Rory on the
other end, Lorelai.

228
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,402
You're not as clever
as you think you are.

229
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:23,231
You rat.

230
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:25,520
- Hi, grandma.
- Hello, Rory.

231
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:27,770
That's my granddaughter, Rory.
Delightful girl.

232
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:30,793
- She's a senior at Yale.
- Fantastic theater program --

233
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:32,311
Meryl, Jodie.

234
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:34,963
- Uh, I thought we had a deal.
- We had no deal.

235
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:37,833
No, a deal for life.
You've got my back. I've got yours.

236
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:40,210
I plan on having a good
time at your wedding party.

237
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:41,583
More importantly,
I plan on making sure

238
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,352
that you have a good time
at your wedding party.

239
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:45,753
Therefore, I think it's important
that you be involved in the planning

240
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:48,193
of your wedding party,
so in the big picture,

241
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:50,101
I do very much have your back.

242
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:51,262
Yeah, whatever.

243
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:53,390
Okay. Bad news.

244
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:56,033
I'm afraid I have to bail on
you and dad for dinner tonight.

245
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:57,651
Mm-hmm. Logan?

246
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,870
Yeah, he's coming to stay
with me for a couple days.

247
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:02,703
He's been so busy with the start-up,
I've hardly gotten to see him lately.

248
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,051
Okay. Can't see you through the phone,
but I'm pouting.

249
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,082
- I'll make it up to you.
- Is he coming to the party?

250
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:10,180
I'm trying to pat the guest list.
If he's coming, I'm in the double digits.

251
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:12,111
- He'll be there.
- Awesome.

252
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:13,952
So okay,
I'll call you later, okay?

253
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:17,232
The stairs are rickety,
and you think you might fall down them?

254
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:18,100
M om.

255
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:20,713
The pool is empty,
and you've hit your head?

256
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:22,551
- Goodbye. 
- Okay, bye.

257
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:25,002
Lorelai, come look at
these invitations.

258
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,502
Can we just send an evite?

259
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:30,562
No? Okay.

260
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,760
Two hours we spent
picking out invitations.

261
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:39,140
- Two hours.
- Wow.

262
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:42,770
Not counting the one hour we spent
picking out the calligraphy -- for
a party.

263
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:44,301
This is gonna be some shindig.

264
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:47,511
"Would you like the brown card
with the cream-colored detail

265
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,743
and  the parchment insert, or 
would you like the cream-colored card

266
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:53,381
with the silk lining and
the clear paper insert?"

267
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:55,021
How about I'd like some cyanide

268
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:57,340
and a 30-story building
to jump off of?

269
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,742
No, we said one sugar cereal.

270
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,841
You're gonna deny
me the captain?

271
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:02,513
We've got a whole box
of Froot Loops at home.

272
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:05,391
With my fragile state,you're gonna
deny me peanut butter Cap'n Crunch?

273
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:08,423
- It rips your gums...
- In a delightful, sugary way.

274
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:11,252
Look, it's got 5% real
peanut-butter-flavored chemicals.

275
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,503
- No.
- Oh, fine. Corn flakes.

276
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:14,752
Which one do we get again?

277
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,931
Avoid the words "made
with real vegetables."

278
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:19,580
I cannot take another
day of Emily and Randall,

279
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,402
and I have nine
more days of it.

280
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,043
That's nine more days
than I can take.

281
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:24,220
Oh, you're doing great.

282
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:26,460
I'm not doing great.
I'm going nuts.

283
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:30,580
Tomorrow we have the food-and-wine
tasting at the Mildred Manor ballroom.

284
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:32,492
Well at least you get to
drink your way through it.

285
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:35,233
No. Fancy people make
you spit out the wine.

286
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:37,362
That's what fancy people do.
But not me.

287
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,610
I'm gonna drink them
under the ballroom.

288
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:41,110
- What time's the tasting?
- 3:30 till the end of never.

289
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:44,121
I've got a meeting in Hartford at 2:00,
but I can meet you there afterward.

290
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,842
- Really?
- Yes.

291
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,441
Honey, that would be so great.

292
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:50,401
I will never eat peanut butter Cap'n
Crunch again. Yes, I will. That's a lie.

293
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:52,520
But together,
we can defeat them.

294
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:55,481
This is serious. I don't want to get
the wrong-colored parchment insert.

295
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,641
The guys at the gym would
never let me live it down.

296
00:11:57,656 --> 00:11:59,511
- We got everything?
- Yeah, we're good.

297
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:01,223
- Oh, no.
- What?

298
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,512
- Bonnie.
- Who?

299
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,502
Taylor's niece, Bonnie,
working the register.

300
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,521
She couldn't be slower or
care less about her job.

301
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,752
I thought life in a small town
was supposed to be leisurely.

302
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:10,971
There's leisurely,
and then there's Bonnie.

303
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:13,831
We're never gonna
get out of here.

304
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:15,050
Go wait outside.

305
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,450
- Really?
- Go.

306
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:21,313
Honey, buy me Tic Tacs.
Hi, Bonnie.

307
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,691
What's up, Lorelai?

308
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:25,431
That's cabbage, hon.

309
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,222
I'm gonna need a void here.

310
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:36,492
- Hi.
- Hey.

311
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:39,000
- Who's -- who's this?
- That's Liz's baby.

312
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:42,282
Oh, wow. Congratulations.
You're an uncle again, huh?

313
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,201
Yeah, thanks.

314
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:45,871
Oh. Well, she's cute.

315
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:47,810
She looks just like T.J.

316
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,663
Hopefully she will
grow out of that.

317
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:51,993
Oh, she's adorable.
She's sweet.

318
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,292
- So what's her name?
- Doula.

319
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:55,873
- What?
- Doula.

320
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:57,453
- Oh, is that...
- A weird name.

321
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:01,122
Weird name. A little bit.
But, no, it's special.

322
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:03,843
It's one-of-a-kind, distinctive.
Can I?

323
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,183
Oh, sure, of course.

324
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,621
Hi. Hi, bubby.

325
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:10,662
Hi. Oh, precious.

326
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:12,533
- How old is she? Two weeks?
- 11 days.

327
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:14,640
Oh, wow. And how's Liz?

328
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,070
Oh, they're great.
They're both doing great.

329
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:19,431
They're gonna make very strange parents
but, you know, good ones, I know.

330
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:21,822
Nothing wrong with a strange
but loving household.

331
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:23,251
Yeah, I guess.

332
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:25,341
Look at her long fingers.

333
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:26,762
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

334
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:28,923
What are you gonna be --
a pianist when you grow up?

335
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:31,142
Is that what you're gonna be,
pretty girl?

336
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:33,971
Or a pickpocket.
Well, yes, you might.

337
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:36,150
You might be a
pickpocketing pianist.

338
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,942
Oh, look what she did. 

339
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,891
- Pretty.
- She's trying to take my finger.

340
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,091
Hey.

341
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:48,430
Hey. Look. It's Liz's new baby.

342
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,800
- Cute.
- Yeah.

343
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:52,851
Well, thanks, um,
for letting me hold her.

344
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:55,750
And tell Liz congratulations
for me, okay?

345
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:56,541
- Will do.
- All right.

346
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:57,570
-  See you.
- See you.

347
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,742
- Want me to --
- I got it.

348
00:13:58,757 --> 00:13:59,822
Okay.

349
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:06,012
We don't have to eat here.

350
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,712
Oh, yes, we do.
You're on my turf now.

351
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,072
- Your turf.
- My turf.

352
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:10,231
You know,
I did go to school here.

353
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:11,473
Yeah, you graduated from Yale.

354
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,172
You can eat from their
cafeteria at least once.

355
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:14,612
I stopped by for the
occasional bowl of cereal.

356
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,311
Yeah, cereal does
not count, okay?

357
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:18,500
You need to get something hot,
mushy, and meaty.

358
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:19,942
You're not making it
sound too appetizing.

359
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:23,180
Oh, it's not. I have an extra
family pass from parents' weekend.

360
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,241
Oh, so when your parents came to visit,
they got to eat real food?

361
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:27,310
I'm gonna tell them
that you're my brother

362
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,480
and that you're gonna
get your meal comped.

363
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:31,382
I don't mind paying
for my mushy meat.

364
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:34,731
No, that's not the issue.
I mean, I know how to work the system.

365
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:35,693
Oh, you do.

366
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,241
Yeah, you know me --
I can be crafty.

367
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,373
Yeah, you can be crafty,
you can make a necklace out of macaroni,

368
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:40,630
but this is
high-stakes deception.

369
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:43,603
What's my middle name?
Rory "high-stakes deception" Gilmore.

370
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:45,193
- Card.
- There you go.

371
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:47,773
And this is my family
pass for my brother here.

372
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,023
Logan!

373
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,661
What's up, brother?
What the hell are you doing here?

374
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:52,520
I thought you moved to
London to run the world or something.

375
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:53,500
Just back for a visit.

376
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:54,662
My brother went here, too.

377
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:55,870
Is this your girlfriend, Rory?

378
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,153
I don't know. Is it?

379
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:58,753
I'm a terrible liar.

380
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,461
Apparently so.

381
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:02,830
- Hi. I'm Rory.
- Brandon. Nice to meet you.

382
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:03,600
You too.

383
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:05,582
So, Dennis,
how much is a lunch pass?

384
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:06,971
$9.75.

385
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,102
So you're still with Nicole?

386
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:10,052
Yeah, till I die
or she kills me.

387
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:11,681
- Well, give her my best.
- Will do, buddy.

388
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:12,843
- Good to see you, Logan.
- You, too.

389
00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:15,152
- Nice to meet you, Rory.
- You too. Bye.

390
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:17,022
- Smooth.
- Shut up.

391
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:19,292
- Man, you worked the system.
- You totally left me hanging there.

392
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:21,181
What could I do?
You were working the system.

393
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:23,740
In fact, you were working the system so
well, I think the system needs a day off.

394
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:26,861
I'll have the chicken, and he'll
have the meat loaf with extra gravy.

395
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:28,692
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

396
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:31,211
Oh, hey, there's Lucy. Lucy!

397
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:32,482
Hi!

398
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:35,242
You must be Rory's
imaginary boyfriend, Logan.

399
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:36,482
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi.

400
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:40,372
I would give you a proper hug,
but my pockets are full of Apple Jacks.

401
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,252
I have art history
in a few minutes,

402
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:45,280
and my professor sounds like
Garrison Keillor on quaaludes,

403
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:47,913
so I need a constant intake
of sugar just to stay awake.

404
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:51,283
I was just treating Logan to his
first branford dining hall meat loaf.

405
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:54,073
Oh, you're in for a
treat and a stomachache.

406
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,103
I can tell.

407
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:58,111
So, congratulations on buying
the internet or something.

408
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:00,122
Thank you, although Al Gore
and I are still negotiating.

409
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:01,523
So it's not a done deal yet.

410
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,152
It's too bad that you have class.
You could have eaten with us.

411
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:06,680
Sad. Hey,
why don't we have dinner?

412
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:09,270
I have a lecture tonight,
but what about tomorrow night?

413
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:10,373
- Sure.
- Sounds good.

414
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:12,172
Fun! We'll have to
go to Panchali's.

415
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:14,103
It's this new indian
restaurant right off campus.

416
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:17,113
It's awesome, and I swear,
no matter how much food you order,

417
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:18,913
you cannot spend
more than 7 bucks.

418
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:20,902
Sounds like
stomachache number two.

419
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:24,131
- Hey, babe. Come on.
- Boyfriend!

420
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:31,522
Boyfriend, this is Rory's
imaginary boyfriend, Logan.

421
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:32,950
I know Marty.
How you doing, man?

422
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:33,611
Hey.

423
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:35,213
How do you two know each other?

424
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,611
We met when I was bartending
one of Logan's parties.

425
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,901
What a coinkydink.

426
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,112
- Yeah.
- More than one.

427
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,871
He did a couple blowouts for me,
and if I'm not mistaken,

428
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:43,502
at the last one,
cops were called.

429
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:44,690
That sounds familiar.

430
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:47,833
You know, you probably met Marty, too,
and you just didn't even know it.

431
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:50,821
We should go. I need to stop
by the library before class.

432
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,191
Right. Okay, bye, guys.

433
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,310
We will see you tomorrow
for basmati and vindaloo.

434
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:56,453
- Okay. Bye.
- Later.

435
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:59,463
Okay. Come on.

436
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:02,941
- Is this okay?
- Fine.

437
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,840
So, what's with that? What's with
the whole "you must have met Marty"?

438
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:07,522
Oh, I meant to tell you.

439
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:08,892
Tell me what?

440
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:11,691
It's kind of embarrassing.
It's so juvenile and lame.

441
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:13,442
It's like high school --
not even high school.

442
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:15,393
- It's junior high.
- I'm listening.

443
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:17,462
Well, I've been hanging
out with Lucy and Olivia

444
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:19,710
and I keep hearing
about Lucy's boyfriend,

445
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:22,450
and they never actually
said his name.

446
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:25,090
And then when I finally met him,
it was Marty.

447
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:28,751
And before I could even say anything,
he just pretended like we've never met.

448
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:32,281
And I just didn't know what to do,
so I went along with it,

449
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:35,302
but now Lucy still doesn't
know that we know each other.

450
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:37,532
It's just kind of
weird and awkward.

451
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:38,723
And did I mention juvenile?

452
00:17:38,736 --> 00:17:40,330
Why did you go along with it?

453
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:43,921
I don't know. It just happened so fast.
I was caught off guard.

454
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:45,600
So why would he pretend
not to know you?

455
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:46,701
I don't know.

456
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:50,583
I mean, maybe because he used to like
me, and maybe he still does a little.

457
00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:53,610
But that's stupid, because he's
with Lucy now, and she's amazing.

458
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:55,332
They're great together.
And it's all so annoying.

459
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,431
I mean, they don't call people by name.
They don't call anyone by name.

460
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,353
French-fry guy -- I don't know
who that is. That could be you.

461
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:03,221
- So what happened?
- What do you mean?

462
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:04,770
He must have said or
done something, right?

463
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,170
To make you think
he's still into you.

464
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,502
I don't know.

465
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:10,523
He said I was beautiful.
To me, he said it.

466
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,331
Can't blame the guy for that.
You are beautiful.

467
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,090
- The way he said it.
- Right.

468
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:16,110
Yeah.

469
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,333
So what?
You guys have been hanging out?

470
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:21,713
No. No, I mean,
just when he's around with Lucy.

471
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,353
So you have been hanging out.

472
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:24,693
Just with Lucy.

473
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:26,371
So why the secrecy?

474
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,703
I told you,
I was caught off guard.

475
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,640
No, with me.
Why did you never mention

476
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:32,242
that you and Marty were
hanging out again?

477
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:33,870
I just didn't
think it mattered.

478
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:35,861
You're not the
secret-keeping type.

479
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:38,712
Of course, that is before I knew you were
Rory "high-stakes deception" Gilmore.

480
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:41,870
No, it wasn't a secret.
I mean, I didn't tell you.

481
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:44,793
That's it. I swear.
I mean, I didn't not tell you.

482
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,931
I just didn't think there
was anything to tell.

483
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:48,800
Well, you have to tell Lucy.

484
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,132
I know.

485
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:51,892
I will.

486
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:55,512
Just, I need to figure out the
right time and way to do it.

487
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:57,370
I just don't want to
screw anything up.

488
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,821
A little brotherly advice --
tell her sooner rather than later.

489
00:19:00,836 --> 00:19:02,753
Yeah, I will.
I'll figure something out.

490
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,943
We don't have to go to dinner with them,
though. I can cancel that.

491
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:06,810
No, it's fine.
We can go to dinner.

492
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:08,793
Unless there's
something on your end.

493
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:10,480
No.

494
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:12,393
Logan, god, no.

495
00:19:12,406 --> 00:19:14,192
Good. Then let's go to dinner.

496
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:16,373
Okay.

497
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,890
Really, they charge
10 bucks for this?

498
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:29,142
Let's make a baby.

499
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,360
- What do you mean?
- Seriously.

500
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:35,392
- Christopher.
- What?

501
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,622
- What are you talking about?
- Why not?

502
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:43,620
What?

503
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,053
Why not?

504
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:53,060
Because we haven't talked
about it at all -- ever.

505
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:55,332
Okay, well,
let's talk about it.

506
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,512
Okay.

507
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,720
You want another kid,
don't you?

508
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:05,323
Oh, god.
Uh, I don't know. I, um...

509
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:09,581
- Sure, maybe.
- Me too.

510
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:13,320
And, you know, last one 
turned out pretty good, so...

511
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:16,911
Last one didn't turn
out pretty good.

512
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:18,472
Last one came out

513
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:22,222
and a lot of work went into
getting her to pretty good.

514
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:24,203
You're right. You're right.

515
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:26,312
I'm -- I'm sorry.

516
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,760
It's okay.

517
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,791
No, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

518
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,792
But, um, it's different now.

519
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,603
We're adults. We're married.

520
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:37,492
It'd be easier.

521
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:39,722
Yeah.

522
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:43,003
I guess. I don't know.
I think...

523
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:46,632
I want another kid.

524
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:50,350
Okay, well,
we're on the same page.

525
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:52,040
Let's go for it.

526
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:55,022
Honey... Chris... honey...

527
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:58,232
Seriously -- seriously,
I don't want to go for it right now.

528
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:02,183
Why not?

529
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:04,723
Why not? We just got married.

530
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:06,682
I mean,
G.G.'s not even back from France.

531
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:09,522
So you don't want
to because of G.G.?

532
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,273
No, I mean,
it's not because of G.G.

533
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:13,440
Because financially, we're good.
We're set.

534
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:15,171
We could have a thousand kids,
feed them,

535
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:17,282
send them to Harvard undergrad,
law school.

536
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:18,731
No, I know.

537
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:22,270
Do you not think we'll work?

538
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:24,543
What?

539
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:26,693
Because if that's what you're thinking,
it's a little late.

540
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:28,911
Oh, my god, no.
That's not what I'm thinking.

541
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:30,712
That's not what I'm
thinking at all.

542
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:32,190
What are you thinking?

543
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:36,093
I just -- What is this?
What is the rush? Why right now?

544
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:42,131
Chris.

545
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,151
Yeah. No, it's fine.

546
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:49,900
- Honey...
- No, you're right.

547
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:52,602
We should wait.
We should. You're right.

548
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,070
- Cesar, what time you got?
- 10 after 2:00.

549
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:14,380
All right. Well, as soon as April
gets here, we're gonna have to run,

550
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,893
'cause we're gonna
miss the movie.

551
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:17,702
- I'm feeling you.
- Stop feeling me.

552
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,601
So business has been
going like gangbusters.

553
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:20,713
Congratulations.

554
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:23,793
Yeah, I'm destroying those
Stars Hollow middle school kids.

555
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,790
Destroying --
outselling them by three or four times.

556
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,672
I think it's safe to say they won't be
getting their new gym anytime soon.

557
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,110
You must be very proud.

558
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:32,200
I am.

559
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:35,011
Sure there's been an increase in
prank phone calls, but so what?

560
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:36,461
I can answer the
phone all day long.

561
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:37,270
I'm sure.

562
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:40,621
And so they've ordered pizzas
to my house day and night.

563
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:42,711
You know what? I love pizza.

564
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:43,700
Bring it on.

565
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:45,722
They think they're intimidating me,
but I'm not scared.

566
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:47,523
12-year-olds don't scare you.

567
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:48,611
Not at all.

568
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,020
Kirk!

569
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:55,380
I thought I told
you to get lost.

570
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:56,663
We want to talk.

571
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,751
So talk.

572
00:22:57,768 --> 00:22:59,792
Not here. Outside.

573
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:01,851
All right. Let's go.

574
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:05,740
But I'm warning you -- if it gets
physical, I will show no mercy.

575
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:10,551
Hello?

576
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:11,902
Hey, Anna, it's Luke.

577
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:12,510
Yeah?

578
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,823
Yeah, I was just wondering
if April took off.

579
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:16,133
She's not here yet,
and she's never late.

580
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:17,252
I'm just getting
a little worried.

581
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:19,520
- April's fine.
- Is she on her way?

582
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,322
No, she's not coming.

583
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,112
What does that mean?

584
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:25,660
Luke, you can't just come to my house,
threaten me,

585
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:28,142
and then expect me to send
April off to see you.

586
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,503
Look, things got a little
heated the other night.

587
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,001
Yes, they certainly did,
and frankly,

588
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:34,283
I'm not comfortable with April
being with you right now.

589
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:35,323
Anna, wait.

590
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:38,171
No, Luke, I won't,
because this is my decision.

591
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:39,242
Goodbye.

592
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:50,712
So we moved away from a literal
theme as per our star's request.

593
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:52,261
- Star -- that's me.
- Yeah, I got it.

594
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:55,003
We did manage to squeeze some favorite
colors out of her, didn't we?

595
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:56,462
Yellow, like my
sunny disposition.

596
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:59,153
Eh, eh, eh. Not yellow.
Buttercup and buttercream.

597
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:00,440
Do you like buttercream
and buttermilk, honey?

598
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:02,383
Or would you like
a nondairy color?

599
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:04,632
Please say you like them.
I've coordinated everything.

600
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:05,282
It's fine.

601
00:24:05,298 --> 00:24:08,102
So of course this area will be
for the tables, as discussed.

602
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:12,523
The orchestra -- excuse me --
band will be over there.

603
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,840
And obviously,
the dance floor is right here.

604
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:16,783
Actually, I'm morally
opposed to dancing,

605
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,453
so that's not
gonna work for me.

606
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:20,041
She's just kidding.

607
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:25,221
I'm so glad you're here. Maybe you can
help keep Lorelai's snarkiness in check.

608
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:26,873
Let's see what
he's got planned.

609
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:30,900
So we still have to
decide on the score.

610
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,902
Have you made a list of
your favorite music?

611
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:35,990
No list necessary. It's going to be
Burt Bacharach. And nothing but.

612
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:37,033
Really?

613
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:39,023
- We'll make a list.
- Wonderful.

614
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,272
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

615
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:44,150
Now, for the fish course, I believe
we have either a Pouilly Fuissï¿½

616
00:24:44,168 --> 00:24:45,980
or a Muscat,
if you go with the salmon,

617
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:48,561
and I do think you should
go with the salmon.

618
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:49,743
Agreed.

619
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,720
Now, as far as the vows go --

620
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:54,242
I'm sorry. The vows?

621
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:55,393
Wedding vows.

622
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:56,653
What are you talking about?

623
00:24:56,665 --> 00:24:58,970
They can be traditional,
or you can write your own,

624
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:01,801
which seems to be the style, nowadays,
although if you ask me, it's rather garish.

625
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,111
Cecily Pendelem's daughter
actually promised

626
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,152
to cook her husband
lasagna once a month.

627
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,702
Who wants to hear the word
"lasagna" at a wedding?

628
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,682
Well, you make a good point, but this
is not a wedding. It's just a party.

629
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:13,400
A party to celebrate
a marriage,

630
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:16,762
which is why a simple exchange
of vows is entirely appropriate.

631
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:20,010
Mom, we agreed to a party, okay?
Just a party.

632
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:21,413
A wedding is a party.

633
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:23,100
Yes, but we are
already married.

634
00:25:23,117 --> 00:25:25,082
Yes, and no one
got to witness it.

635
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:26,990
Did it ever occur to you
that your father and I

636
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:29,602
might like to see our
only child get married?

637
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,952
- Christopher?
- I don't think it's such a bad idea.

638
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,033
- What?
- Might be kind of nice.

639
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:37,811
Wait a minute. Is this an ambush?
Are you guys ambushing me?

640
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:40,111
No one is ambushing
you, Lorelai.

641
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:43,441
The idea of your exchanging vows in
front of your family and friends

642
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:44,953
isn't so outrageous.

643
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:48,940
Mom, the whole reason we eloped
is to avoid the wedding thing.

644
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:51,033
No, that's not the reason we eloped.
We eloped because

645
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:52,642
we love each other and we
wanted to get married.

646
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,283
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

647
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:55,650
- Chris.
- What is the big deal?

648
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:58,080
The big deal is I don't want to
do it and we're already married.

649
00:25:58,118 --> 00:25:59,981
- So that's it.
- Well...

650
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:02,310
I don't even know why I'm here.
It's not like my opinion really matters.

651
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:03,332
Of course it does.

652
00:26:03,347 --> 00:26:04,861
You're gonna do what
you want to do.

653
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:07,040
House, wedding, kids --
it's all your call, right?

654
00:26:07,057 --> 00:26:08,810
Are you talking about
having more children?

655
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:09,763
Thank you.

656
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,783
- Wait! Are you pregnant?
- No

657
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:13,073
- That's nice.
- What?

658
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:14,850
You don't have to act like it's the
most horrible thing in the world.

659
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:16,192
Can we not talk about this now?

660
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,370
Why? You don't want to be spur-
of-the-moment? Let's discuss things.

661
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:20,203
Randall, perhaps we should
give them some privacy.

662
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:21,071
Of course.

663
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:24,021
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

664
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:26,653
You're airing all our business in
front of my mother of all people.

665
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,270
What is your problem
with a wedding?

666
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:29,462
We're already married.

667
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:33,141
Exactly, so what's the big deal? You
planned a huge wedding with that diner guy.

668
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,740
"That diner guy"?

669
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:36,142
Oh, I'm sorry,
should I be more respectful

670
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,700
to the guy who punched
me in the face?

671
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:39,811
- Is that what this is about?
- No, this is about us.

672
00:26:39,827 --> 00:26:41,832
At least, that's what I thought,
but apparently it's about you.

673
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,482
What is that supposed to mean?

674
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:45,560
You know what?
I'm going back to work.

675
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:48,533
No, no. Christopher, hey.

676
00:26:54,527 --> 00:26:56,220
So you want to sue for custody.

677
00:26:56,237 --> 00:26:59,722
No, I don't want to sue her.
I just want...

678
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:03,980
this or something like this.

679
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,881
- So you want partial custody.
- Is that what that is?

680
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:07,911
- Yeah.
- Yeah, fine.

681
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,542
Then I want partial custody.

682
00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:11,190
Then you have to sue for it.

683
00:27:11,206 --> 00:27:13,062
- Really?
- Really.

684
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:14,942
But you're not gonna get this.

685
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:15,940
Why not?

686
00:27:15,957 --> 00:27:18,733
From everything you've just told me,
this is a best-case scenario,

687
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:21,551
and I'm not really in the
best-case-scenario business.

688
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:22,573
What does that mean?

689
00:27:22,588 --> 00:27:26,032
It means you haven't been in
April's life for the past 12 years.

690
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,982
But that wasn't my fault.
I didn't know she existed.

691
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:31,172
- Doesn't matter.
- How can it not matter?

692
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:33,372
Because she has a
history with her mother.

693
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:35,953
This is not about
what you want, Luke.

694
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:37,922
This is not about
what Anna wants.

695
00:27:37,937 --> 00:27:40,301
The court only cares
what's best for April,

696
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:42,821
and in these types of cases,

697
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:45,551
they almost always
side with the mother.

698
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,571
So what can I do?

699
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,842
You can fight.

700
00:27:49,858 --> 00:27:51,171
You can make your case.

701
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:53,721
- Okay.
- Okay.

702
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:55,642
What about Anna's history?

703
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:59,132
- Anna's?
- Any police records? Incidents?

704
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:01,060
Uh, no.

705
00:28:01,078 --> 00:28:03,641
Erratic behavior?
Drugs? Alcohol?

706
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:05,210
I don't think so.

707
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:07,013
So you don't know.

708
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:08,680
We'll look into it.

709
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:10,331
What about you?

710
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,740
Any record?

711
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:14,112
No.

712
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:17,762
Well, yes, actually.

713
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:21,002
I beat up this guy's car this --
this one time.

714
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:22,493
It was no big deal.

715
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:24,902
Did you attend
anger-management classes?

716
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:25,921
No.

717
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,782
Would you be willing to?

718
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:29,702
I don't need to.

719
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:31,222
You might.

720
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:33,143
Look...

721
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:35,321
I don't want this to get ugly.

722
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,210
I just want what's fair.

723
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:39,290
Custody battles get ugly, Luke,

724
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:41,543
and they're not
about what's fair.

725
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:44,953
The truth is this will be long,
it will be expensive,

726
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:46,422
it will be unpleasant,

727
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:48,593
and you'll probably lose.

728
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:52,100
But if you want your daughter,
it's the only way.

729
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:56,032
And time is of the essence here, because
once Anna moves April out of state,

730
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:59,123
it becomes infinitely
more complicated.

731
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:04,550
So I beg and plea with him,
and he says he'll try and come.

732
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:07,002
but I'm afraid he won't,
and I just can't wait any longer.

733
00:29:07,018 --> 00:29:08,830
So I take the ticket,
and I go running off.

734
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,510
I run all the way
back to the theater.

735
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:12,143
When I get there,
I burst through the doors.

736
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:15,330
There's sweat pouring off of
me and I'm gasping for breath.

737
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:16,220
And everybody's gone?

738
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:18,753
No, the director
is still there.

739
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:20,263
- No!
- I know, right.

740
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:21,480
- Can you pass the raita?
- Sure.

741
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:23,600
So I say to him,
"you have to let me audition."

742
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:26,192
And he says, "you can't audition,
because the auditions are over."

743
00:29:26,226 --> 00:29:29,662
And I say, "the auditions can't be over,
because I haven't auditioned yet."

744
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:31,551
And he says,
"you're two hours too late."

745
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:34,032
And I say, "that's because
I was in a traffic accident,

746
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:35,260
and I have the
cop to prove it."

747
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:37,843
Just as I'm about to say,
"and he'll be here any minute,"

748
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:40,051
and, you know,
not really believing it,

749
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:42,621
officer Frick comes
waltzing through the door.

750
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:44,231
- No!
- Like Fred Astaire.

751
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:46,690
- Officer Frick came through.
- Officer Frick came through.

752
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:48,951
- So you got the part?
- Oh, no.

753
00:29:48,968 --> 00:29:50,282
I was totally wrong for it.

754
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:53,411
But officer Frick introduced
me to his nephew Drew,

755
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:56,041
and we went out a few times,
so that was cool.

756
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:59,211
Lucy, hands down, that is the best "dedicated
to my craft" story I've ever heard.

757
00:29:59,226 --> 00:30:00,481
Why, thank you.

758
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:02,383
Hard-working and beautiful --
she's something special.

759
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:03,953
You got yourself a
good one here, Marty.

760
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:04,813
Thanks.

761
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:06,923
Oh, Rory's got way better
stories than I do.

762
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:09,701
Did she ever tell you about the time
she drove out to her professor's house

763
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:12,142
in Albany to replace the
last page of her final?

764
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:14,702
Well, it was in the wrong font,
and I got an "a" on that paper.

765
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:16,473
Wasn't that the professor
who had a crush on you?

766
00:30:16,508 --> 00:30:18,860
Hey! Are you saying that
she didn't deserve the "a"?

767
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:21,573
I'm just saying the woman is the
object of many strange crushes.

768
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:22,892
Oh, that's not true.

769
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,670
The oddball who works
at Baskin-Robbins?

770
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:26,720
She can't walk within a block
of the place without the guy

771
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,491
running out with a triple scoop
of mint chocolate chip.

772
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:29,680
So not true.

773
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:31,402
Hey, she's something special.

774
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:34,211
Hey you know, I put four pages
of endnotes on that final.

775
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,331
I deserved that "a."

776
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:38,432
I'm not saying you're not dedicated to your
schoolwork. You're the hardest worker I know.

777
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:41,251
See, I was always about doing just
enough, or maybe a little less.

778
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:43,703
Well, look at you now, Mr.
Slaving away.

779
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,331
It's true. My rep is ruined.

780
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:47,700
Boyfriend works insanely hard.

781
00:30:47,718 --> 00:30:49,060
Is that true, Marty?

782
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,332
I just have a couple jobs.

783
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:52,470
Four! The man has four jobs.

784
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:55,832
And a full class load.
It's nuts! Right, Rory?

785
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:57,893
It does seem a bit excessive.

786
00:30:57,906 --> 00:31:00,240
- It's not four.
- Four. Rory?

787
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:02,022
I think so.

788
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:05,692
Finnegan's, the bookstore,
tutoring, and landscaping.

789
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,262
The landscaping is seasonal.
I haven't done that for months.

790
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:10,820
But you will,
and that will be four.

791
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:12,572
That's a lot of jobs, my boy.

792
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:16,553
Hey, I'm just waiting for
that trust fund to kick in.

793
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:18,962
I got it.

794
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:22,210
- There.
- Thanks.

795
00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:25,540
So how did you two meet?

796
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:27,730
- Tell him.
- What?

797
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:29,800
- Tell him!
- Why?

798
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:31,791
He stalked me.

799
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,212
That's charming.

800
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:36,702
I was playing Portia in "The
Merchant of Venice" at the rep,

801
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:40,862
and every night,
I see this guy in the front row --

802
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:43,422
same seat, same intense gaze.

803
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,451
And after the fifth show,
I went up to him and I said,

804
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:50,121
"next time I see you, you better bring
flowers or have a knife and stab me."

805
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:51,122
And...

806
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:54,771
The next time I saw her,
I had daisies and a butter knife.

807
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,092
Sweet.

808
00:31:57,336 --> 00:32:00,762
I can't believe I don't even know this.
How did you two meet?

809
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:03,563
Actually, Marty introduced us.

810
00:32:04,838 --> 00:32:06,282
What?

811
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:08,100
I'm sorry.
I can't be a part of this.

812
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:09,553
- A part of what?
- Logan.

813
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:11,742
They've known each other
since freshman year.

814
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:13,352
I don't understand.

815
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,603
Rory and Marty, they used to hang
out all the time at Branford

816
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:17,143
and watch "Duck Soup."

817
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:20,673
What are you talking about?
W-What is he talking about?

818
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:22,813
- Lucy --
- You guys know each other?

819
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,233
Yes.

820
00:32:24,245 --> 00:32:26,782
It was freshman year.
It's no big deal.

821
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:28,562
You've been keeping
this from me?

822
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:30,603
Why? I-I don't understand.

823
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,683
You guys are friends?
You know each other?

824
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:34,830
- I'm sorry, Lucy.
- We just didn't think --

825
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:36,981
So you both have been
lying to me about this?

826
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,212
I don't understand.
Why? For what?

827
00:32:39,228 --> 00:32:40,262
I don't know.

828
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:43,450
Oh, my god. This is so messed up.
I have to go.

829
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:44,833
Lucy...

830
00:32:49,158 --> 00:32:50,643
What is wrong with you?

831
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:53,571
I was asked a direct question.
I'm not gonna lie. She's a nice girl.

832
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:56,530
Yeah, I know she's a nice girl.
She's my friend.

833
00:32:56,546 --> 00:32:58,243
You were gonna tell her anyway.

834
00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:01,703
Not here. Not like this.
You totally humiliated her.

835
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:04,543
Lucy's humiliated because of what
you and Marty did to her, not me.

836
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:06,721
I told her the truth,
which is something she could use more of

837
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:08,510
from her supposed friend
and her boyfriend.

838
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,502
I can't believe you're
trying to justify this.

839
00:33:10,518 --> 00:33:12,072
What you did was so obnoxious.

840
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:13,783
I was just being honest.

841
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,863
I'm just gonna head back
into the city tonight.

842
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,832
I've got a lot of
work to do tomorrow.

843
00:33:21,495 --> 00:33:22,880
Fine.

844
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:39,030
Hi. 143.

845
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:39,981
What?

846
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:43,100
I want to talk to you, but I'm
gonna lose count, so remember 143.

847
00:33:43,118 --> 00:33:45,110
- 143 what?
- Soaps.

848
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,933
- What are you doing?
- Inventory.

849
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:48,472
- At the inn?
- No, at the Pentagon.

850
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:51,301
I'm tracking soaps and nuclear
missiles for General Abizaid.

851
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:52,570
Isn't it a little late?

852
00:33:52,585 --> 00:33:54,031
The general's a slave driver.

853
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:54,720
Mom.

854
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:58,001
Well, it had to get done at some point,
so I thought I'd do it at this point.

855
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,311
- I count better at night.
- Okay.

856
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:01,731
So what's going on?

857
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:03,523
I thought it was
an all-Logan week.

858
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:05,863
- It was.
- Was?

859
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,341
- Boys suck.
- Oh, hon.

860
00:34:08,355 --> 00:34:11,093
- They totally suck.
- Sometimes they do.

861
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:12,991
Tell me it gets better
when they get older.

862
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:14,923
It gets better when
they get older.

863
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:17,193
- It does?
- Well, it gets more confusing,

864
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,212
more complicated, and more complex.
Does any of that sound better?

865
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,091
No.

866
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:23,542
- So what happened?
- It was awful.

867
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:26,012
We went to dinner
with Lucy and Marty,

868
00:34:26,026 --> 00:34:28,171
and I told him
everything beforehand --

869
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:30,803
about how Marty pretended that
we didn't know each other

870
00:34:30,816 --> 00:34:32,461
and I just had to go with it.

871
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:34,952
Yeah. So right in
the middle of dinner,

872
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:37,532
he decides that he can't lie to Lucy,
and he tells her

873
00:34:37,547 --> 00:34:40,142
that Marty and I have known
each other since freshman year.

874
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:41,760
- Yikes!
- I know.

875
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,882
Who does that, right?
Right in the middle of dinner.

876
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:45,711
He has no reason to be jealous.

877
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:47,221
I mean,
he knows that I love him.

878
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:48,370
Of course he does.

879
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:49,611
So why would he do it?

880
00:34:49,627 --> 00:34:52,013
I have no idea.
Mars and venus, you know?

881
00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:53,541
Yeah, see,
I don't think that's right.

882
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:55,663
Because mars and venus
are both planets, right?

883
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,311
So they have
something in common.

884
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,950
I think it's more like
mars and a bowl of soup.

885
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:01,592
- Venus and a bowl of soup.
- What?

886
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:03,713
Venus is the woman.
Venus and the bowl of soup.

887
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:04,882
Really, mom?

888
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,663
Well, I'm just saying.
So how's Lucy?

889
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:10,250
I don't know.
Not good. She ran out.

890
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:13,233
And I've been trying to call her,
but she won't answer her phone.

891
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:15,681
I dont blame her. I mean,
I wouldn't want to talk to me right now.

892
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:18,863
Oh, she'll be fine. She probably just
needs time to cool down, you know.

893
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:21,872
Yeah, I hope so.
I mean, I feel terrible.

894
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,430
Of course you do.

895
00:35:23,446 --> 00:35:24,991
You want to come home?

896
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:27,383
I'm about to start
counting dust ruffles.

897
00:35:27,517 --> 00:35:28,843
No.

898
00:35:28,855 --> 00:35:31,871
I should actually probably go
over there and try, you know?

899
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:33,743
See if she'll talk
to me in person.

900
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:35,510
All right.
Let me know what happens.

901
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:37,731
Yeah, I will. 143.

902
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:39,000
Ah, thank you.

903
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:40,120
Sorry boys suck.

904
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:42,270
Yeah, stupid bowls of soup.

905
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:30,213
Hey. Is Lucy here?

906
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:31,400
She's here.

907
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:32,882
Can I see her?

908
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:36,433
She doesn't want to see you right now,
and, to be honest, neither do I.

909
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,590
Olivia, just let me
explain, please.

910
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,732
No.

911
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:03,601
- Lorelai.
- Oh, my god!

912
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:06,092
Mom, you scared me half to death.
What are you doing here?

913
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:07,882
I want to talk to you, Lorelai.

914
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:10,651
Ugh. Is this about the party?

915
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:12,450
Because I've had
a really long day,

916
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:14,151
and I don't want to
talk about the party.

917
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:17,611
It's not about the party. I've come
to talk to you about your marriage.

918
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,220
- My marriage?
- Yes, I'm concerned.

919
00:39:20,237 --> 00:39:21,570
I don't like what I'm seeing,

920
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:23,713
and I've come to offer
you some friendly advice.

921
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:25,641
Mom, I really don't
want your advice.

922
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,473
Well, then consider
it unfriendly advice.

923
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:29,271
Okay.

924
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:31,982
Christopher is immature,
often foolish,

925
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:34,222
and a little lacking
in common sense.

926
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:36,432
He doesn't always make
the best choices.

927
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:39,871
Like with me? Are you saying he
chose wrongly in choosing me?

928
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:43,403
I'm saying he's your husband,
Lorelai, for better or for worse.

929
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,011
I like Christopher.

930
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,933
Okay.

931
00:39:46,947 --> 00:39:48,483
I think he's good for you.

932
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:50,013
But it's not going
to be perfect.

933
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:52,671
He's not perfect,
and god knows you're not perfect.

934
00:39:52,688 --> 00:39:55,313
But marriage is not
about always being happy,

935
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:57,840
and often it's about
not being happy at all.

936
00:39:58,008 --> 00:40:01,790
It's about compromise,
which is not your strong suit.

937
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:04,700
Marriage is about swallowing
your pride sometimes,

938
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:06,662
about doing what he wants.

939
00:40:06,678 --> 00:40:08,371
It's not about
winning an argument,

940
00:40:08,388 --> 00:40:10,642
which may make you sad,
because that's what you love.

941
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:14,423
But I don't want to
see you ruin this.

942
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,862
Marriage is serious
business, Lorelai,

943
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:19,012
and if you don't take
this very seriously,

944
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:20,313
then this whole thing
could fall apart

945
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:22,561
faster than you could
possibly imagine.

946
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:25,200
And he'll be gone,
and you'll be alone again.

947
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:27,611
A ring is no guarantee.

948
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:33,261
Sorry for scaring you.

949
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:39,303
