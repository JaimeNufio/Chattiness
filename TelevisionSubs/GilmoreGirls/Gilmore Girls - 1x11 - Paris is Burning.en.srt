1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,672
- "L"
- Laryngitis.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,799
- "M"
- Mumps.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,760
- "N"
- Narcolepsy. "O"

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,639
Do we have to do this every time we
decide who has to clean the refrigerator?

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,351
- You wanna go back to thumb wrestling?
- Osteoporosis. "P"

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,978
- Puppies!
- That's not a disease.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,189
Oh, boy!

8
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,693
Hi!

9
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,995
- Rory, look at the baby.
- Mom.

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,667
'Buttercup was found cold and wet,
hovering under a hydrangea bush...

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,670
'along Highway 26.' It's a sad highway!

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,006
As compared to all the happy highways
she could've been abandoned by?

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,344
'Her lineage includes cocker spaniel,
golden retriever, Bouvier des Flandres... '

14
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,180
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you. 'And rottweiler. '

15
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,141
'Buttercup is a special dog.
She is extremely skittish...

16
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,645
'and tends to react badly toward
blond-haired females, brunette males...

17
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:06,066
'children of either sex, other animals, red
clothing, cabbage, or anyone in uniform. '

18
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,944
- We just found the doggy version of you.
- Can I help you?

19
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,656
Do not let these two anywhere near a dog.
They can barely feed themselves.

20
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,200
Shut up. We would be
excellent pet owners, thank you.

21
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,869
- You cannot be serious.
- We could get him a pretty bowl.

22
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,746
- It's a her.
- And a new name.

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,290
- Mom.
- This Buttercup thing really has to go.

24
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,543
- Do I need to remind you of Skippy?
- Skippy?

25
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,713
- I can't believe you would bring that up.
- Skippy was our hamster.

26
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,548
- He doesn't care.
- What happened to him?

27
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,590
Nothing.

28
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,385
Every time Mom put her hand in his cage,
he'd bite her.

29
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,554
- And laugh.
- Hamsters can't laugh.

30
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,723
This one laughed. Trust me.

31
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,143
- So, finally, she got fed up.
- Of being laughed at by a hamster?

32
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,185
Yeah.

33
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,189
She stopped cleaning its cage. Instead,
every day she'd stuff Kleenex in there.

34
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,275
- You didn't.
- It was the quilted kind.

35
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:52,070
This goes on, and the cage is just
a cage full of Kleenex that moves a little.

36
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,114
- And the smell, really good.
- I can imagine.

37
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,240
No, you can't.

38
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,076
Then she takes the cage
to the place where we bought him...

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,247
waits for the sales guy to go behind the
desk, dumps it on the counter, then bolts.

40
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,582
You abandoned your hamster?

41
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,876
I know it was bad,
but this was a vicious hamster.

42
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,881
This was like a Damien hamster with
little beady eyes, and a big forked tail...

43
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,384
and a cape with a hood and...

44
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,138
- Bye, Buttercup. Bye, Luke.
- You did the right thing.

45
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,807
- I want a pet.
- You have me.

46
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,311
- You won't get my slippers in the morning.
- I might if you had slippers.

47
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,604
- Will you wear a collar?
- No.

48
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,230
- It'll be pink.
- You're sick.

49
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,984
Watch how you talk to me.
Remember what happened to Skippy.

50
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,467
God, this is good.

51
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,388
- Okay, correct me if I'm wrong.
- Salt, please.

52
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,766
Twenty minutes ago, we were
sitting at the dinner table, weren't we?

53
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,850
Yes, we were.

54
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:50,188
There were candles and flowers
and plates and knives and cloth napkins.

55
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,983
I loved the little sombrero napkin holders.
Very ole.

56
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,360
And the whole time
we were at said dinner table...

57
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,655
you ate two, maybe three bites
of this amazing dinner I made for you.

58
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,323
Pass the bread.

59
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,411
Yet, as soon as that dinner is over
and I start cleaning up...

60
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,496
suddenly, that's when you're starving.

61
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,541
What can I say? Watching someone work
makes me hungry.

62
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,752
If I hadn't stopped watching
This Old House, I'd be 500 pounds now.

63
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,504
What are you doing?

64
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,549
- Passing these to you.
- In the dish, please.

65
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,014
Where did you learn to make
osso buco, anyway?

66
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:29,769
From this very old Italian woman
who used to live upstairs.

67
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:35,400
She had lost her husband a couple of years
before, and she looked at me like a son.

68
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,444
- Sweet.
- She was.

69
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,863
- So an old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,324
- So, would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.

71
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,293
- Did you read Rory's paper yet?
- Not yet.

72
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,837
- It's really good.
- I'm sure it is.

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,050
- Look, it's right on top.
- Isn't that a coincidence?

74
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,346
There are some really big words in here.

75
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,057
I hope you have a dictionary with you
when you read it.

76
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,267
I will.

77
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,730
I could just save you the time,
and put an 'A' on it for you.

78
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,527
That wouldn't be fair to the other students
whose mothers aren't here, would it?

79
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,237
Yes, you're right.

80
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,992
Although, life isn't fair, and the sooner
those kids learn that, the better.

81
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,203
I'll take that advice into account.

82
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,123
These are beautiful.

83
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,045
I never read Proust. I always wanted to.

84
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,588
Every now and then...

85
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,258
I'm seized with an overwhelming urge
to say something like:

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,554
'As Marcel Proust would say... '
But I have no idea what he would say.

87
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:50,892
So I don't even go there. I could do,
'As Michael Crichton would say... '

88
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,937
- but it's not exactly the same.
- Take it.

89
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:59,067
- Oh, no! It looks so valuable.
- It's a book. It's meant to be read.

90
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,153
- You sure?
- Take it. Read it.

91
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,113
Okay, I will.

92
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,204
- Not now.
- What?

93
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,375
I'd rather you didn't read it right now.

94
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,585
But what about...

95
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,006
my required reading?

96
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,136
But I won't make the cheerleading squad.

97
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:33,226
Mr. Medina, is this my extra-credit work,
because Missy just had to take a test.

98
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,195
Where do you think you're going?

99
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,114
Hi.

100
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,491
It's 1:00 in the morning.

101
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:53,204
I know, but my watch stopped
during a terrible car wreck...

102
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,834
and I had to save kittens
and small children and four baby chicks.

103
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,878
- Did you have a nice time?
- Not bad.

104
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,048
That's a very big smile for a not bad night.

105
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,968
- Yeah, well. He loaned me a book.
- What book?

106
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,304
- Swann's Way.
- Aren't we ambitious?

107
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,388
Yes, we are.

108
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,765
You know what it means
when a man loans you a book?

109
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,184
- That he's already read it?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,103
- How was your night?
- Homework.

111
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,439
- How many times did Dean call?
- Not that many.

112
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,149
- How many?
- Three.

113
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,820
- Five.
- Not an all-time high, but very respectable.

114
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,907
- I'm going to bed. Are you staying here?
- Yeah, I'm comfortable.

115
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,202
I've got the pillows
in a perfect mushed position.

116
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,915
Night, Mom.

117
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,419
- You just go think about what you've done.
- I will.

118
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,759
- What?
- You look happy.

119
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,636
- I am, kid.
- Just checking.

120
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,852
'There's a certain slant of light

121
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,188
'Winter afternoons

122
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,732
'That oppresses, like the heft

123
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,068
'Of cathedral tunes'

124
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:10,239
That, my friends, is the first verse
of a poem by Emily Dickinson.

125
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,077
Read some of those tonight,
and as you do, consider the fact...

126
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:18,414
that Emily Dickinson writes convincingly
about passion and about the world...

127
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:22,043
in spite of the fact
that she lived as a virtual recluse.

128
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,837
It'll help you appreciate her mind.

129
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,803
I could listen to him
talk about passion all day.

130
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,597
- Do you think he's dating anyone?
- Of course he is.

131
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,516
- A teacher?
- Please.

132
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,810
- Why not?
- Have you seen teachers?

133
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,896
- He's a teacher.
- Male teachers are different.

134
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,525
- They can still be mysterious.
- I bet his girlfriend's pretty.

135
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,485
- I bet she's dumb.
- Why?

136
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,654
Dumb girls crave smart men.

137
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,657
It's the whole
Marilyn Monroe-Arthur Miller syndrome.

138
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,991
I still think she's lucky.

139
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,119
Whoever he's dating is a loser
who doesn't care he's a teacher...

140
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,456
in this ridiculous school
making a ridiculous teacher's salary.

141
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,500
What are you looking at?

142
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,669
Guess someone read the paper today.

143
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,172
I know. Paris'parents' divorce
is getting very ugly.

144
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,509
Her dad should've paid her mom more
and this thing would've been over.

145
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,677
That's what my dad did.

146
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,011
- Hi.
- Hi.

147
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:19,350
Is it true Paris' mom had the entire
back of her body surgically reconstructed?

148
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,144
It doesn't match the front now, does it?

149
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,399
- How's the squab?
- It's good.

150
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,319
It's the best tiny, weird bird
I've ever eaten.

151
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,404
I'm glad.

152
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,739
- Why are you smiling like that?
- What?

153
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,575
- You're smiling.
- I'm happy.

154
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,661
- That's not your'I'm happy' smile.
- What smile is it, Lorelai?

155
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,038
That's your
'I've got something on Lorelai' smile.

156
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,833
- Rory, your mother must be very tired.
- She works a lot.

157
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,168
I grew up with that smile.
I know that smile.

158
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,755
- Tell me about school.
- My French final went pretty well.

159
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,508
You can change the subject.
I know the smile.

160
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,469
- Whatever you say, dear.
- I've used it a few times myself.

161
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,512
Mom.

162
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,181
- Tell me about Parents' Day.
- What?

163
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,934
Parents' Day. Next Wednesday.

164
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,021
When parents are supposed to
go to classes with their children.

165
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,189
The Chilton newsletter came out today.

166
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,399
- Yeah.
- Right.

167
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,318
- You didn't read yours?
- Not yet.

168
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,195
But you knew that. Hence the smile.

169
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,408
You're really being silly.
There is no evil plan afoot here.

170
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,286
I simply brought up a subject
I thought we could talk about.

171
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,747
- Right.
- I'll try another subject.

172
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,208
The color blue is very pleasant, isn't it?

173
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,087
Not everybody can wait outside
the mailbox for the Chilton newsletter...

174
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,548
and instantly memorize the contents
in three seconds.

175
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,592
I'd like to weigh in on the color subject.

176
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,511
You have your priorities.
Far be it for me to question them.

177
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,890
Just because I didn't read it
doesn't mean I don't care about Rory.

178
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,475
- So are you going?
- To what?

179
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,559
To Parents' Day.

180
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,520
Can we talk about it next Friday
when I've read the newsletter?

181
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,605
It'll be more fun.

182
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,608
We could, except that Parents' Day
is next Wednesday.

183
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,942
- Wednesday?
- Yeah.

184
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,570
If you talked about it on Friday,
you would've missed it.

185
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,406
- Wednesday?
- It's okay, you don't have to be there.

186
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,159
- We could talk about how you missed it.
- I won't miss it.

187
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,411
Mom, it's not a big deal. You're busy.

188
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,997
- You know what? I'll go.
- What?

189
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,210
Why not? You have to work.
I, as you have insinuated, have no life.

190
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,754
Therefore, I will go sit with Rory
at Parents' Day.

191
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,217
I'm not busy. I'm going. I will be there.
That's it. End of story, okay?

192
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,052
- Fine.
- Fine.

193
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,099
Did you read on Page 2
about the mother-daughter talent show?

194
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,144
You okay?

195
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,107
Mom, I have to go. It's almost 8:00.

196
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,735
Wait. Have you seen
my orange suede hairclip thingy?

197
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,488
- Top right-hand drawer.
- It's not there.

198
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,449
- Did you check in your purse?
- Yes.

199
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,409
- Under your scarves?
- Yes.

200
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,245
In your sock drawer?

201
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,457
I love you.

202
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,084
- I'm gone.
- Bye.

203
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,420
- Wait!
- What?

204
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,881
- Blue disco sequin bag.
- No.

205
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,049
- Why?
- Bad.

206
00:11:57,132 --> 00:11:58,592
- Really?
- Bye.

207
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,347
- Wait!
- Mr. Medina's gonna be here any minute!

208
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,600
Just tell me one more thing.
Where's the silver dangly bracelet?

209
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,435
- I'm wearing it.
- Why are you wearing it?

210
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,146
- Because it's mine.
- Right.

211
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,691
Can I borrow your silver dangly bracelet?

212
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,734
- I'll leave it on the table.
- Thank you.

213
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:21,490
- What was that?
- The doorbell rang.

214
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,244
- Why did the doorbell ring?
- Because someone's at the door.

215
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,289
It's 8:00.
Who shows up at 8:00 for an 8:00 date?

216
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,999
I don't know. Maybe a Chilton teacher?

217
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,543
Everyone knows that 8:00
means 8:15 tops!

218
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,336
Obviously, he was raised in a barn.

219
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,048
He's cute, but his punctuality knocks
10 points off the dream guy quotient.

220
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,050
What do I do? I'm not supposed to be here.

221
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,552
Okay, so go.

222
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,887
Wait, you have to get the door.

223
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,514
- What?
- Because I'm not ready.

224
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,516
I'm not supposed to get the door.
We agreed.

225
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,060
- I don't get the door when you have a date.
- I know...

226
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,230
I shouldn't be here.
First rule of the Gilmore Dating Handbook.

227
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,442
'Daughter shall be nowhere near house
when said man materializes. '

228
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,027
It's a good rule. It's been working.

229
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,070
He's standing there, it's cold...

230
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,365
and my slip is now completely stuck
in my skirt zipper.

231
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,284
Just this once.

232
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,959
- Hi.
- Rory.

233
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,378
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

234
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,719
Can I get you something?
We don't really have anything...

235
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,805
but if you wanted something
and we had it, I'd get it for you.

236
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,098
I'm fine.

237
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,392
- We have water.
- That's okay.

238
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,896
It's not bad water, actually.
It's not a funny color or anything.

239
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,606
I'm good, really.

240
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,485
- We have bottled water.
- No, thanks.

241
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,488
- One bottle, actually.
- It's quite all right.

242
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:45,366
We really need to go to the store.

243
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,247
- Should we...
- Sit? Right. Yeah, let's sit.

244
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,752
So, what are your plans tonight?

245
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,047
- I'm going over to my friend Lane's house.
- Sounds good.

246
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,300
- And you guys are...
- Dinner, movies, the usual.

247
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,094
Right.

248
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,063
- This is a little uncomfortable.
- Yes, it is.

249
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:20,150
But the thing is, if things go well,
the way I hope they're going...

250
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,860
we might be doing this again.

251
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,821
Sitting uncomfortably?

252
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,824
Seeing each other outside of school.

253
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,200
That's okay.

254
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,911
I am fine with
this whole you and my mom thing.

255
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:32,955
Good. I'm glad.

256
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,874
I better go.

257
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,961
- It was good to talk to you.
- You, too, Mr. Medina.

258
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,506
Why don't you call me Max?
Just when we're out of school.

259
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,175
- I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?

260
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,011
It just sounds wrong. Disrespectful.

261
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,891
I mean, you're my teacher, Mr. Medina,
and if I start thinking of you as a Max...

262
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,228
even as a part-time Max,
it just seems like it'll get too confusing.

263
00:14:56,311 --> 00:15:00,649
How about this, then? We'll come up with
non-Chilton names for each other.

264
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,694
When we're not in school,
I'll call you Rebecca.

265
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,946
- Rebecca.
- And you'll call me?

266
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,906
- Norman?
- Norman?

267
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,285
- I look like a Norman to you?
- I'm sorry.

268
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,746
Psycho was on earlier, and it was just
the first name that came to mind.

269
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,582
I'll think of something else.

270
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,543
- How about Alfred?
- You know what? Norman's fine.

271
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,669
Are you sure?

272
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,672
Positive. I love it.
I might make a legal change.

273
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,632
Okay. I better go.

274
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,802
- I hope you and Lane have a good time.
- Thanks.

275
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:33,557
- Would you give this to my mom for me?
- Absolutely.

276
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,850
Thanks.

277
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,604
Norman? Have her home by 10:00.

278
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:46,570
I can't believe
you won't just sell them to me.

279
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:48,906
And I can't believe
you're being so small-minded.

280
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,409
My stuffed fried squash blossoms
are extremely popular with customers.

281
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:53,493
Yes, I know.

282
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,330
People come from all over
and demand them.

283
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,749
- That is exactly my point.
- 'What'll you have, sir?'

284
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,543
'Anything that comes with
stuffed fried squash blossoms. '

285
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,087
That's what I hear day in day out.

286
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,714
Yes, great. I know.

287
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,259
But all I'm asking you is to try
stuffing something different this time.

288
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,720
- A zucchini tush?
- Just a temporary name.

289
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,974
You want me to serve a genetically
engineered vegetable named after a butt?

290
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,727
This is an all-natural vegetable hybrid...

291
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,271
that is perfectly safe,
completely delicious, and...

292
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,441
Yes, it looks a little odd,
but you can put it on the map!

293
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:26,276
- I want the blossoms.
- Fine.

294
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,279
You wanna think small, think small.
I'm done.

295
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,578
- Jackson invented a new vegetable again?
- Yeah.

296
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,039
It's too bad Bowling League
didn't work out for him.

297
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:40,207
Yeah.

298
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,335
- Look, I found them.
- Where?

299
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:45,420
They were in the drawer
with the roasting pans.

300
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,588
- Cool.
- Skates.

301
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,173
Rory and I have a skating date.

302
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:50,425
- I'm Nancy Kerrigan.
- And I'm Tonya Harding.

303
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,386
I'll do the whole shoelace-coming-untied...

304
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,514
nervous-breakdown-let-me-start-again act
and everything.

305
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,642
When was the last time
you put those things on?

306
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:02,270
- You are constantly trying to ruin my fun.
- Do they even fit anymore?

307
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,106
- Yes, they fit.
- They look rusted.

308
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,733
Can I just have some coffee, please?

309
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,985
- Hand them over.
- Why?

310
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,279
I'm gonna clean them
and tighten the blades.

311
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,489
- Really?
- Yes.

312
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,991
- Can you make them really shiny?
- The skates, please.

313
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,993
- Maybe add a few pompoms?
- Hand them over.

314
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,286
Thank you.

315
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:21,832
- You get really good service here.
- Yeah, I do.

316
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,335
- Gotta go.
- Anything wrong?

317
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,463
- Too much yeast, too little bowl.
- Enough said.

318
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,800
I think I'm gonna go for it
and wear the fur-trimmed skating skirt...

319
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:32,968
pride be damned.

320
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,846
What if we invite Max
to go skating with us?

321
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,432
- Max?
- Yeah, I thought he'd wanna go.

322
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,434
When did you start calling him Max?

323
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:44,271
The other night, he said I should call him
something other than Mr. Medina...

324
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,773
when we're outside school,
which makes sense.

325
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,984
So I'm getting used to saying Max.

326
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,319
You don't see him that much
outside school.

327
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,906
No, but I probably will, since you guys
are obsessed with each other.

328
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,951
- I wouldn't say obsessed.
- No, it's okay.

329
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:01,163
Of all the guys to have hanging around,
he seems like a good choice.

330
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,248
- I like him.
- That's good.

331
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,835
- So what do you think about the skating?
- What?

332
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,171
Mr. Medina. I'm sorry, Max.

333
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,757
- Do you think he'd wanna go?
- I don't think he skates.

334
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,093
Maybe we could do
something else together.

335
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,219
Yeah, good.

336
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,514
Something else is good.
I love something else.

337
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,312
Okay, the tea is ready.

338
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:30,358
- How are the feet?
- I don't know.

339
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,445
- They stopped talking to me.
- What on earth were you thinking?

340
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:36,323
- That I could still skate.
- It's not like riding a bike.

341
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:40,201
- Now you tell me.
- So, what are you up to tonight?

342
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,456
I'm gonna do a little line dancing,
then run 10 km...

343
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,500
and then just jump up and down
really hard for an hour.

344
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,878
No Max? Taking the night off?

345
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:53,131
- I don't see him every night.
- He seems like a great guy.

346
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:55,216
- He is.
- That didn't sound convincing.

347
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,595
No, he is. He is a great guy for someone.

348
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:00,430
- For someone?
- Yes.

349
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:02,265
- Someone else?
- Yes.

350
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,686
Someone who's not you, although you're
the person spending every hour with him?

351
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,896
Right.

352
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,691
- How long have you been dating?
- Why?

353
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,527
- Two months you've been seeing him?
- Point, Sookie.

354
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,740
- You're just right on schedule, that's all.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

355
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,242
About now is when you start
doing your getaway dance.

356
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:23,495
Two months, right on the nose.
You're good.

357
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:26,373
- I do not do a dance.
- You're cha-cha-chaing right now.

358
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,209
I'm not cha-cha-chaing. I'm being practical.

359
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:32,921
Rory is starting to get attached to Max,
and that's not good.

360
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:35,632
- Rory's getting attached to Max?
- Yes.

361
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:39,719
And since I've decided
that Max is probably not the guy for me...

362
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,931
I think it's better that we break it off
before she gets hurt.

363
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:44,641
- Practical.
- Yes.

364
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:47,102
- Can I say something here?
- Of course you can.

365
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,145
- Cha-cha-cha.
- Stop that.

366
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,653
You will not stand there
singing Ricky Martin songs to me.

367
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,363
This is not a pattern, okay?

368
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:01,574
I'm not doing what I always do.
This is not the same.

369
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,992
Actually, you're right.

370
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:07,247
Usually you don't get so upset
and defensive during the cha-cha talk.

371
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,125
You must really like this guy.

372
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,168
When did you become
the relationship expert?

373
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,171
You haven't been in a relationship
in years.

374
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:21,010
- Zero to jackass in 3.2 seconds.
- That's all right. Your feet hurt.

375
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:24,681
No, it isn't. It is never ever okay
for me to talk to you like that.

376
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,933
I'm so sorry. Please, honey.

377
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,769
I understand. Really.

378
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:33,273
- It's not like I don't want a relationship.
- I know.

379
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,066
I didn't mean anything by it.

380
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,526
It's hard with my hours.

381
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,863
I'm always at the Inn,
the market or the hospital.

382
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:41,865
Please, forgive me.

383
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:46,161
Do you wanna sing some more
Ricky Martin to me?

384
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:48,580
- No.
- You can.

385
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:51,541
I deserve it.

386
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,850
I heard Paris' dad has actually got
a second family in Paris.

387
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,814
I enjoyed your paper on Dickinson.

388
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,691
- I had fun writing it.
- It showed.

389
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:18,776
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

390
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:21,404
- Rory?
- Yeah?

391
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,118
No, that's it. That's all I wanted to say.

392
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,370
- My name?
- Yes.

393
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:33,374
- Okay.
- Actually I just wanted to see...

394
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,879
if your mom is coming to Parents' Day.

395
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:42,884
Because I'm just trying to get
an accurate number of parents...

396
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,136
who are coming...

397
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,013
for the cookie count.

398
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,934
Forget it.

399
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,062
- She's coming.
- I hadn't heard from her in a while...

400
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:56,356
- She'll be here.
- Okay, good.

401
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,903
But you should put us down for four.

402
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,238
- Four what?
- Four cookies.

403
00:22:05,114 --> 00:22:06,866
Okay, good. I will.

404
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:09,786
Bye.

405
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,252
Four slices, pepperoni pizza.

406
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,046
- From?
- Tuesday.

407
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:23,216
- Last Tuesday?
- Tuesday in the not-too-distant past.

408
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,509
Toss it.

409
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,097
You remember Paris Geller?

410
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:30,932
Your very best friend in the whole world?

411
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:33,977
- Her parents are getting a major divorce.
- Really?

412
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:36,896
Her dad's this bigwig
at a huge pharmaceutical company...

413
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,066
and they're printing all the sordid details
about it in the paper.

414
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,568
- How sordid?
- It's not the Rick James incident...

415
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,321
but Hugh Grant should be feeling
pretty good about himself.

416
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,282
If she was anybody else,
I might feel bad for her.

417
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:49,951
I kind of do feel bad for her.

418
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:52,995
That's because you're the nicest kid
ever to walk the earth.

419
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:54,956
The whole school's talking about it.

420
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:58,000
The weird thing is that
the whole dynamic has changed for me.

421
00:22:58,084 --> 00:22:59,460
Really? How so?

422
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:02,714
Madeline and Louise, Paris' best friends...

423
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,508
they said hello to me the other day.

424
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:09,137
Really? Like a normal hello,
not like a 'Here's Johnny' kind of hello?

425
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:11,681
Normal, friendly, no acts.

426
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:14,225
- You're the new Heather.
- I guess.

427
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:21,065
This is the pizza from mystery Tuesday.

428
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,234
That one's completely fine.

429
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,194
- Don't.
- It's in the box.

430
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:26,279
- Oscar.
- Felix.

431
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:27,989
- Forget it.
- Fine.

432
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:33,327
- So, how's Swann's Way coming?
- Finished.

433
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,538
You're kidding.
It took me forever to read that.

434
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:36,789
I had to renew it 10 times.

435
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,333
The first sentence.
I finished the first sentence.

436
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,752
It's just... I'm so swamped right now.

437
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:45,590
It's the wrong time to start reading
the longest book known to man.

438
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:47,675
Maybe you could
give it back to Max for me.

439
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:48,885
Bring it with you tomorrow.

440
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,511
- Tomorrow?
- Parents' Day.

441
00:23:50,553 --> 00:23:53,848
I know. I'm not sure
I'm gonna be able to make it.

442
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:56,476
- What do you mean?
- I have that thing at the Inn...

443
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,728
and I thought I could get away,
but now I can't.

444
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,147
- What thing?
- The Inn thing.

445
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,690
- What Inn thing?
- You know.

446
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:04,025
No, I don't.

447
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:08,905
The thing at the Inn with the flags
and the little men and the peanuts.

448
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:09,989
Little men?

449
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:13,117
Forget it. It's not important.
I just don't think I can go.

450
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,577
Okay, fine.

451
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:19,540
So if you could give this book back to Max
tomorrow that would be great.

452
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:21,334
Give it back the next time you see him.

453
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:24,212
I'm not sure when that will be,
and he should have his book.

454
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:28,174
- You see him all the time.
- Could you just give it back to him?

455
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:32,261
- Are you breaking up with him?
- What are you talking about?

456
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,514
He hasn't heard from you,
and you're asking me to return the book.

457
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:36,933
How do you know that?

458
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:39,560
He wanted to know
if you were going to Parents' Day...

459
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,063
and then he mentioned
you guys hadn't talked lately.

460
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:43,814
He shouldn't be asking you about me.

461
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:47,193
- Why are you breaking up with him?
- Because it's not working out.

462
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:50,404
- But you seem so happy.
- It's not right, that's all.

463
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,073
That's why you're not going tomorrow?

464
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:54,617
No, I'm not going
because of the thing at the Inn.

465
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,912
That's crap and you know it.
There is no thing at the Inn.

466
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,790
You're avoiding Mr. Medina,
and you're trying to lie to me...

467
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:02,959
and you promised you would go.

468
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:06,003
Do whatever you want. I don't care.
Just leave me out of it.

469
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,797
And give him the book back yourself.

470
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,590
Fine, I will.

471
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:19,558
- Not so fast.
- The bell's gonna ring.

472
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:22,186
Before you go one more step,
tell me you still like me.

473
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,230
- You bug me.
- I'll take that as a yes.

474
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:26,816
I will deal with my issues
with Max myself.

475
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:27,942
- Fine.
- Really.

476
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,527
I believe you.

477
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,987
So, where are we going?

478
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,280
To my locker to drop off some of this stuff.

479
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:34,699
Great, let's do it.

480
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:37,618
- You can't just leave now.
- Paris, please.

481
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:40,997
- At least come to my Lit. Class.
- This place is giving me a headache.

482
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:42,790
- Is your face breaking out?
- No.

483
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:44,792
You have not been using that cleanser.

484
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,962
Dr. Yanalari prescribed that cleanser
for a reason: To cleanse.

485
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,547
Just Lit. Class.

486
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,466
Paris, with everything
I have going on right now...

487
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:55,970
the last thing I need to do
is face people gossiping about me.

488
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:59,682
See you later at home.
Use that cover stick I got you.

489
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:06,313
I bet I'm looking pretty good to you
right now.

490
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,857
Yes, you are.

491
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:11,110
What's first? Wait, don't tell me.

492
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:13,070
English Lit. With Mr. Max Medina.

493
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,407
- Okay, see, I told you not to tell me.
- Sorry.

494
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:19,952
- Mr. Medina's class?
- The fancy book owner himself.

495
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:22,621
How does First Annual
Mother-Daughter Ditch Day sound?

496
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:24,290
- Not happening.
- Yeah.

497
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:25,583
Let's go.

498
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:28,961
On Monday, we will start
a two-week exercise in creative writing...

499
00:26:29,044 --> 00:26:31,172
but that doesn't mean we stop reading.

500
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:32,798
One of the greatest inspirations...

501
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,718
for working writers
is the writing of others that they admire.

502
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,846
Walt Whitman read Homer,
Dante, Shakespeare...

503
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:41,682
and the novelist Edna O'Brien
has been quoted as saying...

504
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,019
that every writer should read
some Proust every day.

505
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,521
Now, at this point, normally...

506
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:52,693
I would impress the parents by pulling out
a copy of Proust's Swann's Way...

507
00:26:52,735 --> 00:26:56,363
and reading a particularly difficult
passage, but, alas, you're all saved.

508
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:58,324
I've misplaced my copy.

509
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:01,577
That does it.
Parents, thank you for coming.

510
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,704
Students, papers on Whitman
are due tomorrow...

511
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:06,040
and those of you
who are just starting tonight...

512
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:07,917
I'll be able to tell.

513
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:17,927
You go on ahead, okay?
I'm gonna talk to Max for a second.

514
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,970
- Please be nice.
- I will.

515
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,899
- It's nice to see you.
- Yeah.

516
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:36,987
- I've been really busy.
- Sure, I assumed.

517
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:39,865
I wanted to give this back to you.

518
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:42,743
- Keep it.
- I really liked it.

519
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:45,454
I liked the first 20 pages,
and then I got busy...

520
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,249
and I can see you really need it, so...

521
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,084
What's going on, Lorelai?

522
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:52,461
Nothing, I just don't think a book...

523
00:27:52,544 --> 00:27:55,130
whose first sentence is 20 pages long
is for me.

524
00:27:55,214 --> 00:27:58,425
- I left four messages.
- I know. I've been meaning to call.

525
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:01,178
- What's been keeping you?
- I don't know.

526
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,306
Things. Sorry.

527
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,934
- Sorry?
- That I didn't call.

528
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:12,022
Here.

529
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:13,941
Why do you keep trying to
give me the book?

530
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:15,109
Because it's yours.

531
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,195
Is there something going on here
that I don't know about?

532
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,947
Yeah, I hate Proust.

533
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,534
Rory's out there waiting for me so...

534
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:29,039
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.
I cannot believe what an idiot I am.

535
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:31,583
- What?
- You're breaking up with me, aren't you?

536
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:32,793
I don't know.

537
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:35,629
Not only are you breaking up with me,
you're doing it badly.

538
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:37,756
- Am I being graded?
- I'm a little disappointed.

539
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,842
I would've expected
a better dumping from you.

540
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:41,468
Nobody's dumping anybody.

541
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:45,264
- Really? Then what is this?
- I just need space.

542
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:46,557
I don't.

543
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,351
In fact, I want as little space as possible.

544
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:51,437
A hundred clowns
crammed into a Volkswagen.

545
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,231
That's the kind of non-space
I'm talking about.

546
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:55,315
It's not working.

547
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,234
It was working pretty good
the other night.

548
00:28:57,317 --> 00:28:59,695
It is what I've been trying to tell you
all along.

549
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:01,613
This is a family, Rory and I.

550
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:03,615
But you weren't listening...

551
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:07,077
and now she's getting attached,
and I'm afraid she's gonna get hurt.

552
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:09,621
Your solution to all of this
is not to return my calls?

553
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:12,374
It just took me a while
to figure things out...

554
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:16,545
and it all came clear when I realized
how much we could hurt Rory.

555
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,757
Don't you mean
'How much we could hurt Lorelai'?

556
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,800
I can take care of myself.

557
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:24,595
I don't understand this.
I thought we went through this.

558
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:26,847
We decided that Rory could handle it.

559
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,517
Maybe she can and maybe she can't,
but I'm not ready to find out.

560
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,019
I won't let you off that easily.

561
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,645
There's nothing you can do about it.

562
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,063
- There has to be.
- There isn't.

563
00:29:35,147 --> 00:29:36,482
- There is.
- No, there isn't.

564
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:39,109
- Yes, there is.
- What are we, in high school?

565
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:41,361
I know we are in high school.

566
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:43,238
This is so not you.

567
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:47,159
- You don't know everything about me.
- I guess not.

568
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:49,787
Because I would've thought
that blaming this on Rory...

569
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,749
and giving me these lame apologies
was weak, pathetic, and beneath you.

570
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,667
Just take your damn book.

571
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:57,628
- You've missed me.
- Stop it.

572
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:01,256
I know you did.
You're missing me right now, aren't you?

573
00:30:01,423 --> 00:30:03,383
- Answer me.
- Class is over.

574
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:04,468
We're back in session.

575
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:07,513
I didn't raise my hand, so don't call on me!

576
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:12,351
I came here to give you this book back.
Please take it.

577
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:16,438
I swear to God, if you try to
give me that book one more time...

578
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:08,490
What's going on?

579
00:31:08,991 --> 00:31:13,120
Everyone's just talking about the mom
Mr. Medina was seen kissing just now.

580
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:14,246
What?

581
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:17,165
And the weird thing is
she looks a lot like your mom.

582
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,583
What are you talking about?

583
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:22,296
Your mom, Mr. Medina, mouths open.
I saw them.

584
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:25,257
How's the coleslaw? Good?

585
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:33,807
Did you save me some Jell-O? What?

586
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:44,985
Where are you going?

587
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,820
Were you kissing him?

588
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:47,863
What?

589
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:50,782
Mr. Medina, just now.
Were you kissing him?

590
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:52,159
Yes.

591
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:54,911
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I don't know.

592
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:57,205
- You said you were breaking up with him.
- I was.

593
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,334
I told you to be nice, but this was extreme,
don't you think?

594
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,669
It wasn't supposed to happen.

595
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:05,464
Paris saw you. It's all over the school!

596
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:09,676
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, I really am.

597
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:14,056
See, this is exactly why
I didn't wanna date him.

598
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:17,517
So you wouldn't come to my school
and kiss him and humiliate me?

599
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,479
- Yes, that's exactly it.
- Why would you do this?

600
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:23,940
Because I'm human.
Because I screwed up. I'm sorry.

601
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:26,902
If you like him so much,
why are you breaking up with him?

602
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:29,488
I broke the rules
when I brought him into our lives...

603
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:32,282
and I realize now that
that was a very bad idea.

604
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:33,450
But why?

605
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:37,329
Because we are standing in this stairwell
yelling at each other, that's why.

606
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:40,123
Because it's affecting you.
It's seeping into your life.

607
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:44,252
That is the whole reason I made the rules
in the first place. To protect you.

608
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:47,589
Maybe it was good that you
hid your personal life when I was a kid...

609
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:49,007
but I'm not a kid anymore.

610
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:52,052
No, you're right.
You're a 40-year-old divorcee. My mistake.

611
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:55,388
- I can't believe you're blaming this on me!
- I'm not blaming you!

612
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:56,932
You made up these stupid rules...

613
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,434
about the way the Gilmore women
would run their lives.

614
00:32:59,476 --> 00:33:02,103
Now you're following them
even though they're crazy.

615
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:05,732
My crazy, stupid rules are the reason
we are doing so good in our lives!

616
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:07,984
They're the reason you grew up
the way you did...

617
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:09,569
the reason you're in this school...

618
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,613
and the reason
you're going to go to Harvard.

619
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:14,741
- So don't you dismiss my rules!
- Fine. Great.

620
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:17,285
Maybe it's time for the rules to change.

621
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:19,871
That is for me to figure out, not you!

622
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:21,498
Great. Fine.

623
00:33:21,581 --> 00:33:23,458
Could you figure it out
before French class?

624
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:26,211
I'd rather you didn't start making out
with Mrs. Collins.

625
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:29,172
No promises
until I see what she looks like.

626
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:34,553
Let's refrain from fighting
in front of the grandma.

627
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:36,096
Fine with me.

628
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:40,100
The last thing I need tonight
is a confrontation with my mother.

629
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:43,895
Hi, Mom.

630
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:48,316
Boy, the roads were a mess
out there tonight.

631
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,946
- Rory, go upstairs please.
- Is everything okay?

632
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:55,282
I have to talk to your mother.
Please go upstairs.

633
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,075
Now, Rory.

634
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:04,791
Lorelai, come here.

635
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:07,961
Did I do something wrong?

636
00:34:08,336 --> 00:34:10,922
I try to understand you. I truly do.

637
00:34:11,006 --> 00:34:13,717
But sometimes your behavior
baffles me beyond belief.

638
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,636
- Which behavior is this?
- Do you have no shame?

639
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:18,972
Is that a rhetorical question?

640
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:22,475
Rory goes to school in that place.
She has a reputation to protect.

641
00:34:22,517 --> 00:34:24,352
- You're her mother.
- How did you...

642
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:26,938
You're supposed to shield her from shame,
not cause it.

643
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:28,315
How, Mom?

644
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:32,277
Kissing a teacher, in a classroom,
on Parents' Day?

645
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,196
They wanted us to get more involved
with the school.

646
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,364
Are you insane?

647
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:39,367
No, but you are
if you think I am discussing this with you.

648
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:42,495
- When I heard I almost fainted.
- How did you hear?

649
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:45,915
I have friends.
Headmaster Charleston's wife for one.

650
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:47,584
That's great.

651
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:51,463
The entire school is talking about it.
And what do I say? How do I defend this?

652
00:34:51,546 --> 00:34:53,965
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake?

653
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:56,009
Is that what you call it?

654
00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:59,095
I tried to call it Al,
but it would only answer to mistake.

655
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:01,639
A mistake is
when you throw out your credit card bill.

656
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:04,184
A mistake is when you forget to RSVP
to a dinner party.

657
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,436
A mistake is when the gardeners
miss trash day...

658
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:10,148
and the barrels are full for a week.
This, my girl, was not a mistake.

659
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:13,568
- Do you even know this man?
- No, this is the first time I'd seen him...

660
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:16,363
there was just something
about the way he held the chalk...

661
00:35:16,404 --> 00:35:18,031
This is not the time for your jokes.

662
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:20,700
Yes, I knew him. I've been dating him.

663
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:22,744
Why on earth would you date
Rory's teacher?

664
00:35:22,827 --> 00:35:25,288
- That is none of your business.
- It most certainly is.

665
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:26,414
How do you figure that?

666
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:28,792
When it affects my granddaughter
it is my business.

667
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,544
I don't wanna talk about this with you.

668
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:33,671
I just wanna know
what you were thinking.

669
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:37,717
What was the reasoning?
How on earth did you justify it to yourself?

670
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:39,552
Max is a great guy.

671
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:42,680
An amazing guy.

672
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:45,558
He's smart. He's sweet.

673
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:49,062
He cooks.

674
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:51,523
So you decided to kiss him
in your daughter's school.

675
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:54,818
No, I decided to break up with him
in my daughter's school...

676
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:57,153
and the kissing part just happened.

677
00:35:57,237 --> 00:35:59,781
You always let your emotions
get in the way.

678
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:03,243
That's the problem with you, Lorelai.
You don't think.

679
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:04,869
Mom, please.

680
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:07,914
- He's just a man, Lorelai.
- No, he's not.

681
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:12,335
Are you telling me this was all worth it
because he was the love of your life?

682
00:36:12,418 --> 00:36:14,629
That this was the man for you?

683
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,881
I don't know.

684
00:36:17,298 --> 00:36:19,008
He might have been.

685
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:21,261
Excuse me.

686
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:30,520
I told you he wouldn't date a teacher.

687
00:36:30,603 --> 00:36:32,689
I wish my mom would
sleep with my teacher.

688
00:36:32,772 --> 00:36:35,275
It would make midterms a lot easier.

689
00:36:36,442 --> 00:36:38,403
Madeline, Louise, excuse us for a minute.

690
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:40,947
- Catfight.
- Go!

691
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:44,909
You're not going to kiss me, are you?

692
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:47,370
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing, I'm great.

693
00:36:47,453 --> 00:36:48,913
You've spent the past two weeks...

694
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:51,875
with your family's private problems
printed in the newspaper...

695
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,626
for everyone to read and talk about.

696
00:36:53,668 --> 00:36:57,130
I saw how you walked around here.
I saw how much you hated it...

697
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:59,465
and then you pull something like this?

698
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:01,175
Doesn't that seem crazy to you?

699
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,720
Do you have any idea
how many people you've hurt?

700
00:37:03,803 --> 00:37:06,097
Forget me and my mom.
What about Mr. Medina?

701
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,807
He likes you. He encourages you.

702
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:11,728
He holds up your papers
and tells the class how great you are.

703
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:16,065
And then you turn around
and spread stories about him.

704
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:20,236
Whatever. Forget it.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.

705
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,155
I do like Mr. Medina.

706
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:23,990
I'd take some dance classes...

707
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:27,619
because the way you express yourself
needs a little work.

708
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:31,873
I probably shouldn't have told people
what I saw.

709
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:34,500
- No, you shouldn't have.
- I'm sorry.

710
00:37:35,877 --> 00:37:40,173
Things have been not good lately.

711
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:41,341
I know.

712
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:45,219
I just didn't want them
talking about me anymore, that's all.

713
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:48,181
- It worked.
- Yeah.

714
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:53,019
- Lf you ever wanna talk...
- We are not friends.

715
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:54,520
That I know.

716
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:59,650
But if you ever do want to talk about...

717
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:01,819
I will, if I want to.

718
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,239
- Okay.
- But I probably won't.

719
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:08,910
- That's fine.
- But if I do...

720
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:11,204
- I'm around.
- Okay.

721
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,165
I'm going now.

722
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:15,917
- Bye.
- Bye.

723
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:21,964
I doubt I will.

724
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,675
I'm not holding my breath.

725
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:34,769
There. Squash blossoms.

726
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,730
All large enough for you to stuff
and fry up...

727
00:38:37,772 --> 00:38:41,442
and serve to the desensitized masses
who just want what they know.

728
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:43,903
Hurrah! Mediocrity wins again.

729
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:46,948
I'm not even gonna charge you for these.

730
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:49,534
I am not gonna profit off
the death of creativity.

731
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:52,870
I would rather starve myself
than know that my food was paid for...

732
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:55,248
by the lowered expectations
of the American public.

733
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:57,333
- Jackson.
- What?

734
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:01,295
Would you like to go to dinner sometime...

735
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:02,588
with me?

736
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:05,550
Okay.

737
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,980
Thanks.

738
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:27,655
Mister, wanna buy
a really nice copy of Proust?

739
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:30,283
- How you doing?
- Well, you know.

740
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:32,952
- You?
- I'm you-knowing also.

741
00:39:37,498 --> 00:39:39,333
That Parents' Day is fun.

742
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:42,253
It was a big hit this year.

743
00:39:44,547 --> 00:39:48,175
Look, the other day,
we were going skating and Rory said:

744
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:50,469
'Why don't we invite Max
to come along with us?'

745
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:54,098
- That was a little weird for me.
- Me, too. I don't skate.

746
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:58,311
She's never really referred to anyone
I've dated by their first name before.

747
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:00,688
I've always kept her out
of that part of my life...

748
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:02,732
so it was like 'the mustache guy'...

749
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:05,359
'the earring guy,' 'the peg leg guy. '

750
00:40:05,443 --> 00:40:07,820
So you have a thing for pirates.

751
00:40:08,487 --> 00:40:11,657
She never called anyone
by their name before.

752
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:13,868
She likes you.

753
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,786
She likes us.

754
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,373
So my mind instantly went to,
'What if we break up? She'll be crushed. '

755
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:23,419
And then my next thought was,
'Oh, my God. What if we break up?

756
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:27,173
'I'll be crushed. '
Then, as you know, all hell broke loose.

757
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:28,716
I understand.

758
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:31,177
I freaked out. I'm so sorry.

759
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:34,680
I never meant to treat you like that.

760
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:37,224
I'm not very good at this. Ask Skippy.

761
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:40,478
- Skippy?
- I'm so sorry.

762
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:44,690
I was called into
Headmaster Charleston's office today.

763
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:46,942
Let me guess.
He put his arm around you and said:

764
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:49,487
'I don't understand
why you kids can't work this out. '

765
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,490
He said I was jeopardizing my career
and future at Chilton.

766
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:56,243
At first I was incensed, outraged.
'How dare he?'

767
00:40:57,244 --> 00:40:59,747
And then I realized that he was right.

768
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:02,958
What happened the other day
was completely unprofessional.

769
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:07,171
I never in my life would have considered
pulling off something like this.

770
00:41:07,254 --> 00:41:08,381
He should've fired me.

771
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:09,882
- But he didn't.
- Not yet.

772
00:41:09,924 --> 00:41:13,052
The word 'probation'
was tossed around quite a bit, though.

773
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:15,805
- I'm sorry.
- I was the one who started the kiss.

774
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:18,432
I'm the one who knocked it up to NC-17.

775
00:41:18,516 --> 00:41:21,435
I honestly did not think
this was going to be so complicated.

776
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,520
I know.

777
00:41:22,603 --> 00:41:26,232
You told me it would be.
I didn't listen. I didn't want to.

778
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:28,442
It's not your fault.

779
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:31,404
If I hadn't acted like a two-year-old
and tried to run away...

780
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,739
and pretend that you weren't
what you are to me...

781
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:35,991
then we wouldn't have fought, or kissed...

782
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:38,077
and I wouldn't have humiliated
my daughter...

783
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,996
and the whole thing would have been fine.

784
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,252
I do not know what to do here.

785
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:51,674
I've never been
in a relationship like this before.

786
00:41:51,757 --> 00:41:54,802
- I'm not thinking straight.
- I know. Me either.

787
00:41:55,344 --> 00:41:58,013
- That was a great kiss.
- Beyond great.

788
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:04,353
Maybe we need to
take a little time away from each other.

789
00:42:07,314 --> 00:42:08,441
Okay.

790
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:11,277
Just to figure out...

791
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:14,196
how to do this so it's not so hard.

792
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,532
Sure, that makes sense.

793
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,994
I don't have any other answers right now.

794
00:42:20,077 --> 00:42:22,454
No, you're absolutely right.

795
00:42:25,332 --> 00:42:27,626
I really, really like you, Max Medina.

796
00:42:29,003 --> 00:42:31,505
I really, really like you, Lorelai Gilmore.

797
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:35,801
So long as we have that straightened out.

798
00:42:37,344 --> 00:42:38,971
Goodbye, Lorelai.

799
00:42:41,348 --> 00:42:42,433
Bye.

800
00:42:58,657 --> 00:43:00,326
Mom, I'm home!
