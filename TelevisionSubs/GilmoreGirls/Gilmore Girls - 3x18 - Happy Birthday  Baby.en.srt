1
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:08,593
Richard, please, we are starving!

2
00:00:08,817 --> 00:00:10,477
I will be right there, Emily.

3
00:00:10,646 --> 00:00:12,331
- This is ridiculous. 
- Mom, relax.

4
00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:14,599
He woke up this morning and suddenly just had to have

5
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,868
this dish that his grandmother would make him.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,404
Yeah, we all understand the cravings.

7
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:19,790
It’s a family secret.

8
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:22,163
Well, last time I checked, I was family.

9
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:23,688
He’s having fun, Grandma.

10
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,171
I saw an open can of cream of mushroom soup.

11
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,583
Nothing good can come of that.

12
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:30,216
Here we are, a treat for the masses.

13
00:00:30,374 --> 00:00:31,194
Smells good.

14
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:33,431
Oh, this is my favorite thing to eat as a boy.

15
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:36,975
My gran used to make this for me whenever I was feeling a little sad.

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,294
You know, if my cricket team lost

17
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,726
or a girl I fancied turned up her nose at me.

18
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,694
Well, then load me up

19
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:44,680
because there was this really cute chick at the pharmacy today.

20
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,760
I used my best material on her and nothing.

21
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,516
Richard, at least let Pina serve it.

22
00:00:48,602 --> 00:00:50,211
No comment on my lesbian hilarity.

23
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,538
My, how far we’ve come.

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,236
Pina will serve tiny, proper servings.

25
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,811
Johnny Machete needs to be presented in a heap.

26
00:00:56,964 --> 00:00:57,779
Johnny Machete?

27
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:00,160
That’s the name of this vile concoction.

28
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,203
- It’s delicious. 
- It’s not bad.

29
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,867
It’s twelve different colors.

30
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:05,142
Come on, Mom, eat it.

31
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:06,764
It looks like someone already did.

32
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,399
- Emily. 
- I’m sorry.

33
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:10,251
I’m happy you’re happy, and to prove it,

34
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,771
I will take exactly three bites of this before I throw it out.

35
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:14,102
- Thank you. 
- You’re welcome.

36
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,191
So, good food, good company.

37
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,086
Now, let’s move onto good conversation.

38
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:20,205
Rory, what is new in your life?

39
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:23,443
Well, funny you should mention it...

40
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:24,932
- Now? 
- Why not?

41
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:28,700
Okay. Mom, Dad, we have some really big news.

42
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:31,727
I got my college acceptance letters back.

43
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,629
Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.

44
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,087
And after giving it a lot of thought, I have decided.

45
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:39,345
I’m going to Yale.

46
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,785
Did you hear that – Yale!

47
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:49,372
I’m going to Yale!

48
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:50,704
That’s where you went, Dad.

49
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:51,844
You liked it, remember?

50
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:53,140
Pass the Johnny Machete, please.

51
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,502
- Pass the... 
- I don’t understand.

52
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:56,361
I thought you wanted me to go to Yale.

53
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:58,031
- No, we didn’t. 
- Absolutely not.

54
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,325
What gave you that idea?

55
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,337
Mom, Dad, look, I know we’ve had our differences

56
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:04,041
over where Rory should go to school, but that’s behind us now.

57
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:06,740
She’s going to Yale, and that’s good.

58
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:08,164
Really good.

59
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:10,268
Nothing but smiles.

60
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,885
We’re both very happy about it.

61
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:12,709
Both.

62
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,676
- Her and me. 
- She and I.

63
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:16,299
Everybody in this room named Lorelai

64
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,877
is over the moon about the ‘going to Yale.’

65
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:19,893
Which means that everybody else in this room

66
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:23,391
not named Lorelai can be equally over the moon about the ‘going to Yale.’

67
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,732
- I’m getting the champagne. 
- I’m calling the Talbotts.

68
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:31,615
Oh, make sure you gloat over that dimwitted son of theirs

69
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,099
who couldn’t even get into Brown.

70
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:34,661
- She’s going to Yale! 
- She’s going to Yale!

71
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:40,508
When I get back, I’ll teach you the fight song.

72
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,463
- So? 
- It looks burned.

73
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:44,911
Thank you. How long to make it not looked burned?

74
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:46,334
Geez, maybe two...

75
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:47,819
Tom, let me help you out.

76
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,914
The answer I’m looking for is ten days

77
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,806
because that’s when I have to get guests back in here again.

78
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:53,962
Okay, ten days.

79
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:55,551
Are you lying to me?

80
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,015
What’s the answer you’re looking for there?

81
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,454
Never mind, just go fast.

82
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:00,717
Go fast, huh? Never heard that one before.

83
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:02,862
Well, everything’s fine in the kitchen.

84
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:04,598
We just have to get the gas line reconnected.

85
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:05,786
How long’s that gonna take?

86
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,039
I don’t know. The plumber’s in there now looking at everything.

87
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:10,364
We forgot to call the Rappaports and they showed up.

88
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:11,700
Oh my God, what did you do?

89
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:13,205
Well, luckily they are not too bright

90
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:15,940
so I convinced them they got their days mixed up and I sent them home.

91
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:16,845
You sent them home?

92
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:18,567
You didn’t even try to get them a room somewhere else?

93
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:19,627
You’re welcome.

94
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:22,402
Hey Laura, try to track down the Rappaports

95
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,480
and see if you can get them into the Bunnyhop Inn. Thanks.

96
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:27,404
Okay, grab a seat and let’s get the meeting started.

97
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:29,023
I’m here, I brought bagels.

98
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,586
Oh, Tobin, great. I’m starving.

99
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,082
Normally I wouldn’t think of it,

100
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:37,444
because what bagel stands a chance next to Sookie’s magical muffins and scones?

101
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:39,380
Oh, Tobin, stop!

102
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,747
Two full pants sizes, my friend, all because of you.

103
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,739
What is he doing here? He is the night manager – it’s day.

104
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:49,518
Michel, this is an emergency staff meeting, I need him here.

105
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,992
I told you I cannot be in the same room with him.

106
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:54,137
It’s an hour out of your life, deal with it.

107
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,644
Hold it. In case of soot.

108
00:04:58,086 --> 00:04:59,488
You’re very sweet.

109
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:01,629
Wait, wait.

110
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:04,849
Let’s let the dry cleaners drum up their own business, huh?

111
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:07,875
My chair!

112
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:09,370
Oh, I’m sorry.

113
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:16,426
Okay, so, should we get a room or what?

114
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,413
Will you just start your meeting?

115
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:21,293
- All right. Here’s the situation. 
- Excuse me, Lorelai.

116
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:23,606
- Michel, did you get a bagel? 
- I don’t want a bagel.

117
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,244
- Are you sure? They’re Kosher. 
- I don’t eat bagels.

118
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:28,471
Bagels are like glue in your intestines

119
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,220
and ensure that everything that enters your body will remain there until you die.

120
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:33,729
Shut up.

121
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:36,602
Okay, let’s focus. As you know, the fire pretty much wiped out

122
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,706
the dining room and five of the upstairs rooms.

123
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,642
Tobin, are you okay?

124
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:41,718
I’m sorry, I just...

125
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:44,190
I just love this place so much.

126
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:46,228
I’ve been the night manager here for five years

127
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,707
and I’ve spent so much time walking these halls,

128
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,574
listening for friendly ghosts flying around, playing...

129
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:53,453
Make a point, bagel boy.

130
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:55,572
It just hurts me to see it wounded, that’s all.

131
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:57,216
It won’t be wounded forever.

132
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,412
We will rebuild and we’ll be back and better than ever.

133
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,201
We just need to keep it going until then.

134
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:06,090
So I need some ideas on what to do.

135
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,123
You know, I was thinking... I’m sorry, may I?

136
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:09,255
- No. 
- Go ahead.

137
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:10,914
Well, if we could get a celebrity in here,

138
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:12,357
that would generate a lot of publicity.

139
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:14,472
But how could we get a celebrity in here?

140
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,270
I know Tony Randall and Renee Estevez.

141
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:17,637
I’d be happy to put in a call.

142
00:06:17,806 --> 00:06:20,411
Okay. Look, I hate to bring this up, especially since –

143
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:22,557
I mean, how do you top Renee Estevez?

144
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,896
But we have a small number of rooms, yes?

145
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,396
- Yes. 
- And the lobby’s fine,

146
00:06:26,556 --> 00:06:28,159
and Sookie can make certain things at home –

147
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,415
muffins, baked goods, jams, et cetera.

148
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:32,864
- So? 
- So that’s breakfast,

149
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,953
and we have beds, and if we add some free wine

150
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,499
and cheese around five in the afternoon...

151
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,060
No. We’re not becoming a bed and breakfast. Who’s next?

152
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:40,391
You’re being stubborn.

153
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:42,440
Bed and breakfasts are cutesy and annoying.

154
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:43,981
It forces people to mingle.

155
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,194
I do not support the mingling.

156
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,610
Adding a little gimmick will be an incentive for people to keep their reservations.

157
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:50,556
You know what, I hate to say it,

158
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:53,780
not being a B&B man myself, but Michel is making sense.

159
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:55,869
Get off my side immediately.

160
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,205
All right, I’ll consider it.

161
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,524
Sure, if he says it, you will consider it.

162
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:02,536
I gotta show you something.

163
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,595
- Is it bad? 
- No, it’s great.

164
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:05,972
You’re gonna be thrilled, really.

165
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:07,960
Warm up, cartwheels are coming.

166
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,199
Keep talking. Be right back.

167
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:12,596
Excuse me, Lorelai?

168
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:14,471
Listen, I know you’re crazed right now,

169
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:17,180
but I also remembered that your birthday is coming up on Friday,

170
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,879
and well, I got you a little something.

171
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:21,050
Oh, you didn’t have to do that.

172
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:22,643
It’s very small.

173
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,111
Tobin, I love candles.

174
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,697
And it’s scented, cappuccino.

175
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,361
God, that smells great.

176
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:29,546
I’m really glad you like it.

177
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:30,778
I do, thanks.

178
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,826
And listen, I’m the night manager here

179
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,671
and I’m very proud to be the night manager,

180
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:37,563
but with everything so wacky crazy around here right now,

181
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:39,638
if you need some extra help during the day,

182
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:40,912
please call me.

183
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,190
I may take you up on that offer, Tobin. Thanks.

184
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,045
- Stairs squeak. 
- Stairs squeak.

185
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,490
There’s a chip on the banister.

186
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:56,441
Chip on the banister.

187
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:58,460
The paint’s chipped in the archway,

188
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:01,506
and there’s a board loose in the entryway.

189
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:03,129
Ooh, and the chimney needs to be swept.

190
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:03,932
- Mom. 
- What?

191
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,250
Luke cannot sweep our chimney.

192
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:05,889
Why not?

193
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,132
Because you need to be a chimney sweep to sweep a chimney.

194
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:10,181
Please. If Dick van Dyke can do it, so can Luke.

195
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,659
Luke is going to be very sorry he ever made this offer to you.

196
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:15,873
Hey, Luke has given me five free hours of handyman work

197
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,624
for my birthday for the last five years.

198
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,631
And you have grossly exploited that gift every year for the past four years.

199
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,162
I need to make up for that first year

200
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:23,785
where I didn’t milk it like I should’ve.

201
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,730
The spirit of giving is completely lost on you.

202
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:29,310
But the spirit of getting is alive and well and it wants its chimney swept.

203
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:30,958
Ooh, put down laundry, too.

204
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:32,817
Fine, then can he also build me another bookshelf?

205
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:35,894
I’ve never been prouder of you than I am right at this moment.

206
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,566
And tell him to paint little flowers on it.

207
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,857
‘Cause he’s so good with the florals.

208
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:42,136
Hello?

209
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:43,811
I finished the paper on Dickinson,

210
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,397
the Physics test was for a third grader,

211
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:47,518
and I picked the history of the Egyptian political process

212
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:50,211
- as my International History project. 
- You’ve been very busy.

213
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:51,209
I’ve been very bored.

214
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:52,524
When are you coming back to school?

215
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:55,602
My parents return tomorrow. I think my mom’s bringing home a new face.

216
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,345
Really?

217
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,033
There’s a doctor in France who injects some kind of gel into your head

218
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,825
and then molds it to give you better cheekbones.

219
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:02,041
You are kidding me.

220
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:03,807
She has to sleep on her back for a month,

221
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,267
otherwise her face will flatten like a crepe.

222
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:06,777
Oh my God, it’s Brazil.

223
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,947
Anyway, I’ll probably have to go back to school when they get home, so...

224
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,961
It will be fine.

225
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,142
Are people still talking about my meltdown speech?

226
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,123
- No. 
- Great.

227
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,752
Who cares what they’re saying, Paris?

228
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,501
Just give me more homework, it will keep my mind off my life.

229
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:20,617
There is no more homework.

230
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,670
In fact, I think you’ve almost finished your first year of college.

231
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:24,934
I just can’t sit here thinking. I’ll go crazy.

232
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:26,705
Why don’t you go out and do something fun?

233
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:27,719
Like what?

234
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,701
I don’t know, but it’s your last day of freedom.

235
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,340
Go be wild. Go crazy.

236
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,275
- Don’t think, just do. 
- Do what?

237
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:34,361
- You’re thinking. 
- But...

238
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,677
- Still thinking. 
- What if...

239
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,201
- Paris, don’t think. 
- Okay, I won’t think.

240
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:39,307
I’ll see you tomorrow.

241
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,208
Hey, do you think Luke can knock this wall out

242
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:44,836
and build us a bigger kitchen in five hours?

243
00:09:44,945 --> 00:09:46,142
You’ll have to drop the laundry.

244
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,497
Never mind. Oh my God, I’m exhausted.

245
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:51,211
Are you too exhausted to talk about birthday week?

246
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:53,362
I’m never too tired to talk about birthday week.

247
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:57,980
Okay, so, Monday I thought we’d start with facials at Sloopy’s after school.

248
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,414
Mudpack Monday, I love it.

249
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:01,375
Then we’ll have double feature Tuesday,

250
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:04,397
Sephora Wednesday, complimentary makeover Thursday,

251
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,202
and then, big fat fabulous Friday.

252
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:08,661
- D-day! 
- BD-day!

253
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:12,327
Culminating in the fabulous blowout of a party you’re planning.

254
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,770
Oh, I’m sorry, you wanted a party?

255
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:17,316
I told everyone you didn’t wanna make a big deal out of your birthday this year.

256
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,109
You’re not funny.

257
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,065
Miss Patty and Babette wanted to hire these two hot guys

258
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:22,159
to carry you around all day and feed you Bon-Bons,

259
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:25,655
and Kirk wanted to hire the Red Hot Chili Peppers to play a concert in the square,

260
00:10:25,753 --> 00:10:29,342
but I said, “Hey, please respect the lady’s wishes.

261
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,918
She deserves that at her age.”

262
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:32,169
Why are you so cruel to Mama?

263
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,208
- I have to go. 
- Where?

264
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:34,238
None of your business.

265
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:35,656
You are planning something for Friday night, aren’t you?

266
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:36,909
I’ll bring back Chinese for dinner.

267
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,688
And you tell people no matter what they say,

268
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:40,304
I just couldn’t accept a new car.

269
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:43,193
It would be beneath me and I’d be completely humiliated.

270
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:46,444
And a convertible would just make me fling myself off a building.

271
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:48,072
- Bye. 
- Bye.

272
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:51,085
- Hello? 
- Lorelai Gilmore?

273
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,337
- You got her. 
- I’m calling from Richard Gilmore’s office.

274
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,642
- Never heard of him. 
- Richard Gilmore, your father.

275
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:57,408
- Oh, tall, bow tie? 
- Yes.

276
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:59,410
Yes, I’m with you now, go ahead.

277
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:02,657
Okay. Well, he’d like to set up an appointment to meet you for coffee.

278
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,428
Would tomorrow work for you? Two o’clock?

279
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,550
Well...

280
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:08,500
Make it three, Karen. I have that conference call at two.

281
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:10,573
- Is that my father? 
- Excuse me?

282
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:12,273
- Put him on the phone, please. 
- But...

283
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:13,849
- Hand it over, honey. 
- I...

284
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,339
Come on, let’s go, chop chop.

285
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:17,286
- What are you doing? 
- She wants to talk to you.

286
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:18,841
Just tell her I’ll meet her tomorrow.

287
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,220
I tried, it didn’t work.

288
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:22,087
But I pay you to make my appointments.

289
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,163
Dad!

290
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:26,235
Lorelai, hello.

291
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:28,052
Are you telling me that you were sitting

292
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:29,798
right next to this woman while she called me?

293
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:31,351
She is my secretary, Lorelai.

294
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,892
You were sitting right there?

295
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,613
This is the way a proper business is conducted.

296
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,129
Two feet from the phone?

297
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:37,352
I’m not going to argue with you.

298
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:38,806
Are you available tomorrow or not?

299
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:40,035
What is this Dad?

300
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,755
I have something I need to discuss with you.

301
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:44,213
- Well, discuss it now. 
- I don’t have the time now.

302
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:47,008
Put Mrs. Huh-wiggins on the phone. Have her tell me.

303
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,692
Please, Lorelai, can you meet me tomorrow at three o’clock or not?

304
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:50,906
Fine, where?

305
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:53,900
I will have Karen call you tomorrow to confirm it and tell you the place.

306
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,677
Why can’t you just tell me now?

307
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:58,155
Leave me just a semblance of my structure, please.

308
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:01,693
Fine. I’ll talk to the woman sitting right next to you tomorrow.

309
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:08,376
So, that’s a four foot chocolate cake

310
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,443
with individual vanilla cupcakes on top

311
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:14,991
spelling out “Happy 16th Birthday Lorelai”?

312
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:15,882
That’s right.

313
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,482
Would you like butter cream or whipped cream frosting on that?

314
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,492
Can you do both?

315
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:20,925
That’s a lot of frosting.

316
00:12:21,064 --> 00:12:22,943
I know, but it’s my mom’s favorite part.

317
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,381
Once we tried to make a cake entirely out of frosting,

318
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:28,309
which turned out to be better in theory than in actual execution.

319
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,332
Both frostings it is then.

320
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:31,928
What time do you want to pick it up?

321
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,727
Miss Patty will pick it up around five.

322
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:36,078
- All right, you’re all set. 
- Thanks, Fran.

323
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:38,944
- We have a glitch. 
- What?

324
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:42,113
Well, apparently, the world’s largest pizza was 122 feet, 8 inches.

325
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:43,450
- What? 
- It says it right there.

326
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,759
- Well, obviously we can’t do that. 
- Obviously.

327
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:48,274
So, then, we’ll have to make it the largest pizza in Connecticut.

328
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:50,982
Actually, Litchfield made one last year that was 98 feet.

329
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,758
Pete said the biggest they could do was a twelve footer.

330
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,673
Maybe you could make her the world’s biggest something else.

331
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:56,133
- Like what? 
- I don’t know. Taco?

332
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,867
I think the world’s biggest taco would be a little difficult to serve, don’t you?

333
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,766
Well, it would definitely be more of a commitment.

334
00:13:00,844 --> 00:13:03,102
We’ll just have to tell her it’s the world’s biggest pizza.

335
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:04,321
Lie to her on her birthday?

336
00:13:04,514 --> 00:13:05,420
It’s for her own good.

337
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,141
So, how’s the music selection coming?

338
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:10,341
Good. I’ve decided to choose one song from each year in Lorelai’s life.

339
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:12,426
I’m almost done, though I’ve hit a snag in 1974.

340
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:13,009
Bad year?

341
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:15,154
It’s making the year of the Macarena look inspired.

342
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,129
Hey, can you stash this at your house ‘til the party?

343
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:19,179
It’s just favors and stuff.

344
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:21,683
Ironic, isn’t it? You having to hide things at my house for a change.

345
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:22,816
Life has come full circle.

346
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:25,610
- I got the video for tonight. 
- What’d you get?

347
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:26,902
- Almost Famous. 
- No, not again.

348
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,207
I can’t help it, I’m addicted.

349
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:30,136
Fine, but if I’m going to spend two hours sitting there

350
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:33,096
watching Kate Hudson commit suicide again, then we are ordering Indian food.

351
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:33,869
Oh, come on.

352
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:36,768
Hey, last night when we watched Ed Wood we got burgers like you wanted to.

353
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,964
Okay, fine – tonight, Indian food, but tomorrow,

354
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:41,110
Saturday Night Fever and Thai food.

355
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:43,859
That’s so cute. You’re like a really sweet old agoraphobic couple.

356
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:44,797
Thank you very much.

357
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,445
- Okay, I’ve gotta go. Bye. 
- Bye.

358
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,475
So, it’s been a couple days since you made the big decision.

359
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:52,436
- You still going to Yale? 
- Yes, I am.

360
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:55,089
It’s got all the classes I want and some really great teachers,

361
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,858
and plus, you know, as an added bonus, it’s really close to here.

362
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,076
- 22.8 miles. 
- How’d you know that?

363
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,195
- Do you Yahoo? 
- You looked it up?

364
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:02,988
Yeah.

365
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:04,274
You looked it up.

366
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:06,522
I just hit a couple buttons on the computer.

367
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:07,735
You looked it up.

368
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:09,123
I was bored.

369
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:11,617
There was nothing on TV and I was fooling around,

370
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,848
- it was something to do, that’s it. 
- You looked it up.

371
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:17,777
I’d like the wording to be a little harsher.

372
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:21,505
Taylor, it already says that if Aunt Tilly’s Taffy delivers even two hours late,

373
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:23,554
they forfeit all payment for that particular shipment

374
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:26,810
and are liable for any loss of income that may result from that late delivery.

375
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,085
It’s pretty extreme.

376
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,283
Well, it may seem extreme,

377
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:31,644
but these candy people are shifty characters.

378
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:34,455
Why don’t we leave the wording like it is for now and see how things go?

379
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,462
We can always get tougher later if necessary.

380
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:38,690
Yeah, you can send over a couple of Oompa Loompas

381
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:40,385
to kick the crap out of Aunt Tilly.

382
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:42,489
- Are you still dating him? 
- Yes, I am.

383
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:43,543
- Why? 
- Oh, Taylor.

384
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:44,691
I mean, if you’re lonely,

385
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,800
I have a nephew I would love to introduce to you.

386
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:50,036
He just got back from a three-year stint in a biosphere in Arizona.

387
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,377
- Can I give him your number? 
- No.

388
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:54,051
- I’m not talking to you. 
- It’s my lucky day. Is he done?

389
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:55,382
All right, fine.

390
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:58,387
We’ll leave it your way and see how it works out.

391
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:03,242
So, listen, after I dispose of Taylor’s body, are we hitting a movie tonight?

392
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:04,281
- Yeah, we are. 
- Okay.

393
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:06,616
Luke, could you sit for a second, please?

394
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:07,650
I could.

395
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,257
Could you do it soon?

396
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:11,439
Okay, listen, if I sit down, are we gonna have the conversation?

397
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:13,092
- The conversation? 
- Yeah, you know, the conversation.

398
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:14,086
Luke, please.

399
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,985
Here comes the conversation.

400
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:18,813
My parents are coming into town

401
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:22,581
and I am going to have lunch with them and I thought maybe you’d like to join me.

402
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,866
- Join you? 
- What do you say?

403
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:26,099
It’s not that I don’t wanna meet your parents,

404
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:29,995
it’s just that I haven’t met any parents for a long time.

405
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:33,891
Well, you don’t have to. I’m just giving you the option.

406
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:36,078
Jeez, man, just meet her parents already.

407
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,758
Do you mind?

408
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,669
So what if they hate you? You’ve been there before.

409
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:40,696
You know what, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to put you on the spot.

410
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:45,054
I’m not on the spot. Really, I’m completely off the spot.

411
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:46,682
I’m spotless.

412
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:48,899
What time’s the lunch?

413
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:50,200
Two o’clock on Thursday.

414
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,085
Two o’clock on Thursday. Okay, two o’clock on Thursday, I’ll be there.

415
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:54,047
That’s great.

416
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,102
- So I’ll see you tonight? 
- I’ll see you tonight.

417
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,110
- I have to go. 
- Where?

418
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:02,153
- School. 
- Oh, school, okay.

419
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:03,812
Well, have a good day...

420
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,182
- At school. 
- I will.

421
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:49,898
Mills College.

422
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:51,994
Isn’t that the one where all those girls with bad hair cried

423
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,914
- because they were gonna let boys in? 
- Yes.

424
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,156
- And why are you going there? 
- It’s the one that took me.

425
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:58,259
- But why’d you apply? 
- I needed a fallback option.

426
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:01,312
Well, fall back, baby, right into some big mama’s loving arms.

427
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:02,715
Ooh, how depressing.

428
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:04,051
Let’s talk about you, did you decide?

429
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:04,860
Last night.

430
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:06,217
- Brandeis? 
- Tulane.

431
00:17:06,331 --> 00:17:08,009
- The Big Easy. 
- Enough said.

432
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:11,090
Oh, Paris, hi, you’re back.

433
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,258
Oh my God. What happened to your nose?

434
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,599
- You had it done. 
- Finally.

435
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:16,134
- I did not have it done. 
- Did you fall?

436
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:18,618
No, I didn’t fall. I had it pierced.

437
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,088
- You what? 
- Oh my God.

438
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:21,164
Why would you do that?

439
00:17:21,302 --> 00:17:23,212
Because you told me to go out and do something crazy.

440
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,455
Yes, but I meant have some ice cream, go see three movies,

441
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:28,838
buy a new purse. I didn’t mean go poke a third hold in your nose.

442
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:31,009
I didn’t buy a new purse, I pierced my nose.

443
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:32,956
And within an hour of having it done,

444
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:35,131
my nose swelled up to four times its normal size,

445
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:37,794
blocking all nasal passage, making it impossible to breathe.

446
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:40,307
I went to the emergency room, where they pried the thing out of my nose

447
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,726
and shot me up with antibiotics.

448
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:44,108
I spent the night with an ice pack strapped to my face.

449
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:44,994
Oh, Paris.

450
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,042
It seems that I was allergic to the crap metal hoop

451
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,340
that I paid $19.95 to have jammed into my nose.

452
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:50,267
Did you take a picture?

453
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,619
No, Louise, I did not take a picture.

454
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:53,686
I was a little busy trying to get air to my brain cells,

455
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:55,751
a burden you’ve not yet faced.

456
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:57,201
Paris, I’m so sorry. I...

457
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:58,461
I didn’t...

458
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:01,097
Hello?

459
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:02,898
Rorino, good, I caught ya.

460
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,300
Okay, there’s a bit of a design flaw in the pizza here.

461
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,605
What kind of design flaw?

462
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:08,721
I’m a little concerned that the crust is not gonna be able

463
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:10,580
to support all the toppings we talked about.

464
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:12,402
We might need to put in a second crust.

465
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:13,457
A second crust?

466
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:15,828
About three-quarters of the way in, sort of like a retaining wall.

467
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:17,994
What about just making the crust thicker?

468
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:20,370
Okay, we’re brainstorming, I got it.

469
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:23,523
A thicker crust, a thicker crust, that might do it.

470
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:26,037
Let me noodle around with that for awhile and get back to you.

471
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:27,590
Okay. Bye Pete.

472
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:30,789
I will not let you look at my nose for ten dollars, you sick job.

473
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,075
Beat it, now!

474
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:34,718
Come back when you have a twenty.

475
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:37,889
What? Just making lemonade here.

476
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:44,069
I’m coming!

477
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:52,594
Coming.

478
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:56,023
Hiya.

479
00:18:58,283 --> 00:18:59,255
Your slave is here.

480
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,202
And where’s the French maid outfit I requested?

481
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,848
- I’ve got it on under the plaid. 
- So what else is new?

482
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:06,039
So, how does it feel to be a year older?

483
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:08,098
I’m not a year older until Friday, Fifi.

484
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:09,081
What the hell is this?

485
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,725
My birthday Mallomars.

486
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:12,465
She says like I should just know this.

487
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:13,416
Here’s your list.

488
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:16,036
What’s wrong with the garbage disposal?

489
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:17,185
It’s not disposing.

490
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:22,440
- Next. 
- You’re so good!

491
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:25,429
Did you ever consider the possibility of just pulling the spoon out yourself?

492
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:26,863
I did consider it, yes.

493
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:29,096
Do you wanna start upstairs or down?

494
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,025
‘Cause there’s actually more to do upstairs this time for some reason.

495
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:34,181
What’d you just do?

496
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:35,957
- What? 
- You put the cookie down.

497
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:38,210
You ate the cookie, and then you took a cookie out of the box

498
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:40,197
and put it where the cookie you just ate was.

499
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,378
Well, that’s nuts.

500
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,074
Rory made this for me, I don’t wanna ruin it.

501
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:45,066
Then why’d you eat the cookie?

502
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:46,029
‘Cause I wanted a Mallomar.

503
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:47,443
But why didn’t you just eat one out of the box?

504
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,529
‘Cause this one was right here.

505
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:50,853
The box was all the way in the cupboard.

506
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,768
But you had to go to the cupboard to get the box

507
00:19:52,912 --> 00:19:54,683
to replace the cookie you ate off the table.

508
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:55,446
So?

509
00:19:57,536 --> 00:19:58,666
Looking at the list now.

510
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,538
Okay, stairs, gutters,

511
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,067
da-duh-da, electrical outlet. Which one?

512
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:07,075
- In the bathroom. 
- By the sink or by the bathtub?

513
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:08,222
- Bathtub. 
- Okay.

514
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,909
So, I can do most of this list today, but,

515
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:14,217
I can’t put up the towel rack until later. I didn’t bring my drill.

516
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:16,355
Dirty, yes, I know.

517
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,725
That’s okay, I’ll be here tomorrow afternoon

518
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,215
- if you wanna come by then. 
- I can’t tomorrow,

519
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,971
I’m having lunch with Nicole’s parents.

520
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,558
Really?

521
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:25,986
- They’re coming into town. 
- Okay.

522
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,982
So Nicole thought I should meet them.

523
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:29,098
Makes sense.

524
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:32,653
Yeah, well, you know, we’ve been seeing each other fairly regular now, so...

525
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,505
makes sense.

526
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:35,887
Yeah, I think it’s great.

527
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:37,629
Yeah, I do, too.

528
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,522
I should get started upstairs.

529
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:44,930
- By the way... 
- What?

530
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:46,738
- You were right about Jess. 
- What about Jess?

531
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:47,767
He’s not going to school.

532
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:48,893
Are you sure?

533
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:51,294
Yup. I watched him head right toward the school

534
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:52,920
and when he thought no one was watching him,

535
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,568
he got in his car and drove off.

536
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,518
So I got in my truck and followed him.

537
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:57,885
- Where? 
- To Wal-Mart.

538
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,081
He’s been lying to me this whole time.

539
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:01,168
What are you gonna do?

540
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:02,919
I’m gonna tell him that I know what he’s been doing,

541
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,216
remind him that we had an agreement, that he’s supposed to go to school,

542
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:08,167
that he’s supposed to graduate from school, and then...

543
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:11,653
I’m gonna tell him I know what he’s been doing.

544
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,364
- I’m sorry, Luke. 
- Yeah, well.

545
00:21:14,258 --> 00:21:16,840
- I’m gonna be upstairs. 
- Okay. Call if you need anything.

546
00:21:25,678 --> 00:21:26,318
Rory!

547
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:27,992
Hey, Jackson. Listen, could you...

548
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:28,903
What do you think you’re doing?

549
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:31,531
I’m trying to transport all the sodas for the party in one trip,

550
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,748
which seemed a little silly when I first come up with the idea

551
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,159
and it’s rapidly growing in its stupidity.

552
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:38,024
You know, I never took you for being thoughtless,

553
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,185
but I guess I was wrong.

554
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,292
What are you talking about?

555
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:42,098
I got the sugarless Red Bull just like you like.

556
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:44,065
You really hurt Sookie, you know that?

557
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:45,467
Why, what did I do?

558
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:47,198
What did you do, what did you do?

559
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:49,575
Let me see, what did you do?

560
00:21:49,949 --> 00:21:52,339
Jackson, if you could stop moving around, it’d be a lot easier.

561
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:53,475
You know, I just heard you’re making

562
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:56,309
the world’s largest pizza for Lorelai’s birthday party, is that true?

563
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,265
Yes.

564
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:59,616
And it doesn’t occur to you to consult Sookie?

565
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:01,787
Oh. Oh no.

566
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,447
The woman is a gourmet chef and Lorelai’s best friend in the world,

567
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:06,980
and you don’t include her in this?

568
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:10,061
But Sookie’s an artist – pizzas didn’t really seem to be her thing.

569
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:11,510
Everything’s her thing, young lady.

570
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:13,846
Jackson, I swear, I would never purposely hurt Sookie.

571
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,689
Besides, it’s not the world’s largest pizza.

572
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:18,270
It’s not even the tri-county area’s largest pizza.

573
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:20,537
I have a sobbing pregnant woman at home,

574
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:23,573
which is not unusual, except this time I didn’t cause it!

575
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:25,069
I’m so, so sorry.

576
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:26,908
And by the way, there wouldn’t happen

577
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,725
to be vegetables on that pizza, would there?

578
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,005
Well...

579
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:31,854
Because I don’t know if you got the memo or not,

580
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,821
but I happen to be a produce man.

581
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:35,494
And a darn good one at that.

582
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:39,370
Yet, I don’t remember a call asking me to handle the vegetables.

583
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,350
Was there a call? Did I just miss it? Was I out?

584
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:45,648
Well, you see, the veggies were included in the price, so it just...

585
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,443
Jackson, I’m sorry!

586
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:52,170
I hope you and your world’s largest pizza will be very happy together!

587
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,597
It’s not the largest pizza in the world!

588
00:22:54,813 --> 00:22:57,353
We may beat Woodbridge, but that’s it, I swear!

589
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:06,630
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

590
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:08,269
- Everything okay? 
- Oh, yes.

591
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:11,449
I just had a few calls to make that took up a bit more time

592
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,814
than I had anticipated. Have you been here long?

593
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:15,447
Twenty minutes and two pieces of pie.

594
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,560
Amazing.

595
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:19,128
Well, then, let’s get right down to it, shall we?

596
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:20,466
Can I get you something to drink?

597
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,971
Iced tea, please.

598
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,046
Another cup of coffee, Lorelai?

599
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:24,183
Thanks, Sarie.

600
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:25,364
So, Lorelai.

601
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:26,369
So, Dad.

602
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:29,017
I appreciate you taking the time out to meet me like this.

603
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:32,222
And I appreciate you actually showing up and not sending your secretary.

604
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,891
I assume you’re wondering why I asked you here.

605
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:35,800
Not at all.

606
00:23:35,923 --> 00:23:37,665
Well, I have something for you.

607
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:40,502
- Is it a hat? 
- No.

608
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:41,486
- Is it a purse? 
- No.

609
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,679
- Horse? 
- Lorelai.

610
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:44,343
George Foreman Grill?

611
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,132
When you were born, I decided to celebrate,

612
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,986
so as soon as your mother went to sleep, I left the hospital,

613
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,355
I called my business manager and I made a real estate investment.

614
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,049
You do know how to party, don’t you?

615
00:23:55,162 --> 00:23:56,750
I made this investment in your name.

616
00:23:56,881 --> 00:23:59,959
Wow, most people just buy a stuffed bear. This is better.

617
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:01,015
I thought so.

618
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:03,666
Anyhow, a little while ago, I got a letter from a lawyer

619
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,072
who is representing the investment group

620
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,424
informing me that the government is building a road

621
00:24:08,557 --> 00:24:10,273
right through the middle of your investment.

622
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:11,235
Sad.

623
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:13,718
Which means that the complex has been sold

624
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:16,293
and all the investors will be receiving a check.

625
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,097
Happy.

626
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,566
Since you are one of the investors...

627
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,374
- I get a check? 
- You get a check.

628
00:24:20,564 --> 00:24:22,244
Wow! That’s...

629
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,413
Seventy-five thousand dollars?

630
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:29,274
Yes, it is.

631
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:31,834
I get seventy-five thousand dollars for being born?

632
00:24:31,962 --> 00:24:33,539
thought it would be a pleasant surprise.

633
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,525
This is seventy-five thousand dollars.

634
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:37,697
Seventy-five... do you have a pen?

635
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,625
Why, yes, I do.

636
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:43,098
Seventy-five thousand dollars. Seventy-five thousand dollars.

637
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:47,052
Oh my God, that’s like 150 pairs of Jimmy Choos.

638
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:48,973
- What are Jimmy Choos? 
- Shoes.

639
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:50,610
150 pairs, that’s it?

640
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:52,422
Dad, they’re Jimmy Choos.

641
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:53,683
For seventy-five thousand dollars,

642
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:56,682
you should be able to buy at least three or four hundred pairs of shoes.

643
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:57,702
Not Jimmy Choos.

644
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,650
But that’s ridiculous.

645
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:01,496
You are not going to spend seventy-five thousand dollars on Jimmy Choos

646
00:25:01,594 --> 00:25:04,282
when you could buy four hundred pairs of less prestigious

647
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,775
but I’m sure equally stylish shoes.

648
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,383
You will shop around first.

649
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:09,980
- Is that clear? 
- Yes, sir.

650
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:11,384
All right, then. It’s settled.

651
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,196
Listen, Dad, this money isn’t...

652
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:14,470
Isn’t what?

653
00:25:14,656 --> 00:25:16,038
It isn’t some kind of gift, is it?

654
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:16,795
Gift?

655
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:19,747
Like a birthday gift. Because if it is, it’s too much and I can’t...

656
00:25:19,844 --> 00:25:20,714
This isn’t a gift.

657
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,532
I made this investment in your name.

658
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,581
You received a check, that’s the way these things work.

659
00:25:24,853 --> 00:25:27,412
Legally, I’m obligated to give you that.

660
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:30,040
This isn’t charity or generosity, it is the law.

661
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,925
It’s the law that I get to keep seventy-five thousand dollars.

662
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:35,220
Enjoy the shoes.

663
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:42,918
- We could buy a boat. 
- We could, but why?

664
00:25:43,164 --> 00:25:44,966
Because rich people always have a boat.

665
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:46,651
We could park it in the front yard.

666
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,664
Yeah, like white trash rich people.

667
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:51,019
God, this is amazing. No more clipping coupons.

668
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,323
No more picking loose change up from the ground.

669
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:55,637
No more driving around looking for cheap gas.

670
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,552
Which totally defeats the purpose

671
00:25:57,685 --> 00:25:59,912
since you wind up using more gas looking for the cheap gas.

672
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:01,432
Seventy-five thousand dollars.

673
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:02,667
I feel so rich.

674
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,691
And suddenly in complete agreement with everything Bush has to say.

675
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:08,595
- I’ll get it. 
- No!

676
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:10,516
Ah, more secret birthday calls.

677
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,950
Not everything is about you.

678
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,178
- It could be Jess. 
- It’s about me.

679
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:15,739
- It could be Lane. 
- It’s about me.

680
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,479
It could be Paris, it could be Madeline, it could be Louise,

681
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:21,484
it could be a myriad of other people wanting only to talk to me about me.

682
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,962
It’s about me.

683
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:25,893
Hello?

684
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,254
Rory, we got a big problemo.

685
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:29,011
What’s the matter, Pete?

686
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:30,455
We did a trial run of the pizza.

687
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,967
You know, just wanna make sure everything was right there for the big day, you know.

688
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:34,997
I appreciate that.

689
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,153
So we made a trial pizza,

690
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:39,605
and Kirk built a pizza rack on top of his car, you with me?

691
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:40,876
Like a bad habit, Pete.

692
00:26:40,987 --> 00:26:42,596
So as Kirk’s putting the pizza on the rack,

693
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:45,417
the thing collapses, the pizza slips, long story short –

694
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:47,838
Kirk has got some severe cheese burns.

695
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,831
Oh my God, is he all right?

696
00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:52,759
Who knows? The point is...

697
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:55,110
I think the pizza needs to be cheeseless.

698
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:57,071
- What? 
- And possibly sauceless.

699
00:26:57,301 --> 00:26:59,216
- Pete. 
- The thing’s a hazard, babe.

700
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:01,218
Pete, did it ever occur to you that the problem

701
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:03,092
may not be the pizza, it may be Kirk?

702
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:05,150
- Did not occur to me. 
- Well, it should have.

703
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:07,859
The pizza has to have cheese and sauce,

704
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:09,821
otherwise, it’s not a pizza. It’s bread.

705
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,248
Okay, look, if you’re gonna insist on the cheese and the sauce,

706
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,619
you’re gonna have to provide the transportation yourself.

707
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:16,312
Fine, Pete, I will figure something out.

708
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:18,085
Roger wilco, senorita.

709
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:21,428
- Who was it? 
- Astrid from school.

710
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:23,128
She’s leaving for Europe for a week

711
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:25,503
and she wants me to take notes and email her everything.

712
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,911
She’s afraid she’s gonna fall behind.

713
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,102
It was about me.

714
00:27:33,326 --> 00:27:34,842
- You’re home late. 
- Traffic.

715
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,227
Traffic, right, okay. So, you hungry?

716
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,451
I’m meeting Rory.

717
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,799
Want me to make you guys some sandwiches?

718
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,907
So we can brown bag it on our date? I don’t think so.

719
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:42,860
Just offering.

720
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:43,987
How was work?

721
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:45,784
The cleaned-up version of The Eminem Show

722
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:49,056
seems to be selling pretty well, so the world is basically coming to an end.

723
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:52,266
So listen, I wanna talk to you about something.

724
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:53,255
Talk.

725
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:56,511
Could you stop grooming for just a second please?

726
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:57,479
I’m already late.

727
00:27:57,857 --> 00:28:00,674
Look, I was doing some thinking about your situation.

728
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:01,595
My situation?

729
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,644
Yeah, you know, you’re working here, you’re working at Wal-Mart,

730
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:07,524
you’re dating Rory, going to school. It just seems like a lot.

731
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,853
You ever worry that if a bird flies into your head it might never get out again?

732
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,195
I’ve got everything under control.

733
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:13,260
Yeah, I’m sure you do.

734
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:17,120
I just thought maybe I could make things a little easier.

735
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:17,914
How?

736
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,746
Well, I could give you a raise at the diner.

737
00:28:20,926 --> 00:28:21,944
- A raise? 
- Yeah.

738
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:24,669
And maybe help out with some of the, you know,

739
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:26,742
bigger money burdens, like your car insurance.

740
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:27,981
Why would you wanna do that?

741
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,787
So you can quit your job at Wal-Mart.

742
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:30,628
No way.

743
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,978
But you’d still be making money, and this way,

744
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,228
you’d get to spend more time on Rory and school.

745
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:39,671
- I’m fine. 
- Jess, come on.

746
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:41,187
- No. 
- Jess, just take the deal.

747
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,266
I have to change.

748
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:44,355
I know you’re not going to school.

749
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:45,308
What?

750
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:46,640
I saw you get in your car and drive off.

751
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,498
- You spying on me? 
- You lied to me!

752
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:50,639
Once in awhile I take an extra shift, it’s nothing.

753
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:51,796
You have to go to school, Jess.

754
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:53,101
- I go enough. 
- What does that mean?

755
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:55,042
It means I go enough. It’s public school.

756
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:57,423
My history teacher is also the football coach, get the picture?

757
00:28:57,546 --> 00:29:00,151
Jess, we had a deal. You go to school, you graduate.

758
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,831
I know. Relax.

759
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:04,559
I got it all under control. I have to change.

760
00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:07,418
Jess.

761
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:12,261
That’s right, breakfast is included.

762
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:15,020
Then at five, we invite all the guests to the lobby

763
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:17,551
for complimentary wine and cheese and mingling...

764
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:21,117
Yes, it is kind of like a B&B...

765
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,501
Okay, great. We’ll see you and Sweetie then. Bye.

766
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:27,707
Any thoughts?

767
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:30,852
So, as you know, we have to get this place up and running

768
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,985
as quickly as possible for as little money as possible.

769
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:37,502
So last night I pulled out the old Time Life series,

770
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,457
and I have to admit, there’s some pretty terrific ideas in here.

771
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:44,420
For example, we can putty up the cracks in the drywall

772
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:47,491
and then give the lower part of the wall a good coat of paint.

773
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:50,779
Then we can take a strip of wallpaper, put it around the top,

774
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:53,242
thus creating sort of a border, if you will.

775
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:56,534
Also, I gathered up all the broken China from the dining room

776
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:57,988
because I read here in Martha

777
00:29:58,111 --> 00:30:00,640
that chipped teacups make great votive holders,

778
00:30:00,805 --> 00:30:04,339
and we all know, when in doubt, it’s candles, candles, candles, right?

779
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:07,359
So I cleaned them up, filled them with tealights,

780
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:08,998
and I think they look terrific.

781
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:11,153
Oh, the pieces that were too far gone to save,

782
00:30:11,255 --> 00:30:12,315
I just smashed them up

783
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:15,731
and used the pieces to make this nice picture frame.

784
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,859
Ah, that’s a great idea, Tobin, really.

785
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:22,270
Lorelai. I have a little something for you.

786
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,257
- For me? 
- Yes.

787
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:28,050
I wasn’t sure it would get here in time since I ordered it from Madrid,

788
00:30:28,154 --> 00:30:31,910
but thank God it made it. Happy birthday.

789
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:34,363
- You bought me a present? 
- Yes.

790
00:30:34,574 --> 00:30:36,776
- You’ve never bought me a present. 
- I have, too.

791
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,773
Not once in the five years I’ve known you have you ever...

792
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:40,565
Just open up the bag, please.

793
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:45,966
Oh, Michel, it’s beautiful.

794
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,555
Yes, well, I wanted it to be special, you know.

795
00:30:49,663 --> 00:30:52,756
Not just some knick- knack you could pick up at the supermarket

796
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:54,783
or the car wash.

797
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,539
Well, it’s great. I love it.

798
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,476
I must say, I feel very spoiled.

799
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:01,742
A beautiful day book, cappuccino candle.

800
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,605
Oh, that reminds me, I got you something else.

801
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:05,459
What? Tobin, you already gave me a gift.

802
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:06,816
- No, that was a pre-gift. 
- A what?

803
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:07,498
Hold on.

804
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,279
Why don’t you scooch just a little bit for me?

805
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:12,904
Tobin, this is too much.

806
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:16,394
Yes, it is, but I saw it and it just screamed Lorelai.

807
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,783
Okay, well... God, this is exciting. I love my birthday.

808
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:22,504
- I hope it fits. 
- Fits?

809
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:24,464
Tobin, it’s amazing.

810
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:26,692
That is the jacket that Joe Strummer wore

811
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:29,279
during the 1979 Pearl Harbor tour.

812
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:30,640
- No. 
- Yes.

813
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:31,680
Who is Joe Strummer?

814
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,717
- Tell me you’re kidding. 
- Who is Joe Strummer?

815
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,098
- You did not get me this. 
- Is he a Hell’s Angel man?

816
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,131
Joe Strummer is from The Clash.

817
00:31:38,253 --> 00:31:39,068
The Clash is a band.

818
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,003
- And a band is a... 
- I know what a band is.

819
00:31:41,158 --> 00:31:43,875
He just died, and Rory and Lane have been in mourning for months,

820
00:31:43,942 --> 00:31:45,795
and now I have his jacket.

821
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:49,652
And, oh my God, this is by far the coolest thing I have ever gotten.

822
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:53,419
God. Oh, smell it, it smells like Joe.

823
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:57,004
Well, this is wonderful, to smell like a dead guy.

824
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:58,971
You’ll have to beat them off with a stick.

825
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:01,127
And there’s a letter of authenticity in the bag,

826
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,980
and a picture of Joe wearing the jacket,

827
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,295
and also, they threw in a beret just for the heck of it.

828
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:07,588
Tobin, you are getting a hug!

829
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:10,441
Well, I’d fight it, but what’s the point, right?

830
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:13,450
I have to run an errand.

831
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:14,382
Why, where you going?

832
00:32:14,563 --> 00:32:16,344
Just be here when I get back.

833
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,231
Oh, I just love this jacket.

834
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,998
- Nicole, you’re being... 
- I am not being stubborn.

835
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:25,443
You didn’t let me get the stubborn out.

836
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:26,753
Luke, would you like a blini?

837
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:27,686
No, thank you.

838
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,288
When you sign up to become a surrogate mother,

839
00:32:29,426 --> 00:32:30,997
you enter into a business agreement,

840
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:33,046
and the rules of business should apply.

841
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:35,058
You as a lawyer should understand that.

842
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:36,984
As a lawyer, I do understand that.

843
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:40,492
As a human being, I also understand that when a woman’s alone...

844
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:41,300
Here we go.

845
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,887
And in need of money, can do things that she’ll later regret.

846
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,284
I could get you some cheese.

847
00:32:45,428 --> 00:32:47,399
You cannot force a mother to give up her child.

848
00:32:47,557 --> 00:32:48,909
If she signed a paper saying,

849
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:52,243
“On April the 12th I am giving birth and whatever comes out, I’m handing to you...”

850
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,441
What a lovely way to put that.

851
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:55,555
And you pay her money and her medical expenses...

852
00:32:55,678 --> 00:32:56,579
They always do this.

853
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:58,627
They pick a subject and they argue until dinner,

854
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:01,341
then they call a truce and they pick it back up for dessert.

855
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,544
I could get you some nuts.

856
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:04,491
Okay, enough. I don’t wanna argue with you anymore.

857
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:06,338
What can I do with her, Luke? I ask you.

858
00:33:06,574 --> 00:33:09,211
Oh, well, probably not much.

859
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:11,178
So Luke, I feel like we’ve been ignoring you.

860
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,053
Oh, that’s okay.

861
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:13,871
Nicole told us you’ve never been married.

862
00:33:14,044 --> 00:33:16,210
Or we could talk about how he owns his own diner.

863
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:17,522
That’s a good opening topic.

864
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:20,342
Hush, sweetheart. You just sit there and pretend to be ashamed of us.

865
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,570
No, I have never been married.

866
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:24,573
But someday, maybe, right?

867
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,886
Marriage, children?

868
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,897
She means eventually and with the woman of your choice.

869
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:31,306
They will not be involved in the picking.

870
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:33,723
Because there is nothing more wonderful than marriage.

871
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,723
You know, the others escaped out the bathroom window. Just a tip.

872
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:39,663
And then children. Well, there’s nothing more rewarding than children.

873
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:41,716
You just can’t imagine until you’ve been there.

874
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:44,579
That’s true. And this one here made everything in life worth it.

875
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:47,681
The whole experience is like the most fabulous roller coaster ride

876
00:33:47,768 --> 00:33:50,917
you can imagine. From the time they’re born to that first step.

877
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:54,516
The first word. The first time they hug you.

878
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:56,642
The first time they pick out their own outfits.

879
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,295
The first time they tell you they’re going to school

880
00:33:58,388 --> 00:34:00,691
and then you follow them, and they get in their car and drive to Wal-Mart.

881
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:01,398
Wal-Mart?

882
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:02,421
And they think you don’t know.

883
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:03,574
They think you’re just a moron and you’re going,

884
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:05,572
“Hey, they must be telling me the truth, right?”

885
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:07,855
And they don’t think that maybe you know

886
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:10,605
that they’re lying to your face and that you’re really mad

887
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:12,228
because you guys had an agreement.

888
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:13,016
Oh dear.

889
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:15,116
And that agreement was clear, very clear.

890
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:17,297
And they know that breaking that agreement is a violation

891
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,826
of everything you had talked about. Oh yeah, that is cute.

892
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,945
That’s just darling. I can’t wait to experience that again.

893
00:34:28,408 --> 00:34:30,610
I’m sorry, did someone mention cheese?

894
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:41,094
Hey guys.

895
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:44,002
Rory, good, just the lady we’re looking for. We have a plan.

896
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,297
Good, ‘cause I’ve got a check.

897
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:48,282
We’ve solved the problem of transporting the big pizza thing.

898
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,360
I was of little help since I’m currently in excruciating pain.

899
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:54,088
Instead of this whole one huge pizza concept,

900
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:56,690
we’re gonna do a hundred little pizzas all sitting next to each other.

901
00:34:57,043 --> 00:34:57,605
What?

902
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,513
Like a pizza doily.

903
00:34:58,661 --> 00:34:59,787
I don’t want a pizza doily.

904
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,671
Okay, less a doily, more of a collage.

905
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,927
I don’t want a pizza collage either.

906
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,150
Hey guys, I got another idea.

907
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:05,804
How about we put the pizzas together,

908
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,006
and then put pepperonis over the open spots.

909
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,182
So it looks like one big pizza, tricky.

910
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:11,047
Okay, hold on.

911
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:12,403
Or we could put cheese over the holes.

912
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,612
- Please don’t say the C- word. 
- Guys.

913
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,974
- Cheese might fall through the holes. 
- We can use slices.

914
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,571
- That’ll work. 
- That will not work!

915
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,256
- Hey, Rory. 
- No.

916
00:35:19,357 --> 00:35:20,601
Now you three listen to me.

917
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:22,771
We agreed that this was going to be the world’s largest pizza.

918
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:25,988
That was the concept. Now I realize it can’t be the world’s largest pizza

919
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:29,629
because that pizza was insane, but it is still going to be large.

920
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:30,843
Very large. Crazy large.

921
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:32,225
- But we... 
- No buts!

922
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:34,473
That was the concept – get back to the concept!

923
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:37,012
This is not Gangs of New York now with Cameron Diaz.

924
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,466
This is Gangs of New York twenty years ago with Meryl Streep

925
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:41,353
as Scorsese originally imagined it.

926
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,191
Come back, refocus, remember the goal.

927
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:45,445
Am I making myself clear?

928
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,275
- Cameron Diaz is hot. 
- Not the point, Joe.

929
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:50,509
Okay, jeez.

930
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:53,290
Now tonight is my mother’s birthday party

931
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:54,841
and the whole town is going to be there

932
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:57,720
and they are expecting music, favors, and a really large pizza

933
00:35:57,801 --> 00:35:59,184
and they will not be disappointed.

934
00:35:59,384 --> 00:36:01,386
I don’t care how you do it, just do it!

935
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:06,695
Somehow I can’t picture Meryl Streep with Leonardo Dicaprio.

936
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:11,313
I really am sorry, Nicole. Your parents must think I’m a lunatic.

937
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,827
No, I don’t think lunatic was one of the words they used.

938
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,713
But they have a very extensive vocabulary,

939
00:36:15,814 --> 00:36:17,084
so there may just not have been time.

940
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,785
It’s the first time I meet them and I just...

941
00:36:19,195 --> 00:36:21,064
Jess was driving me crazy and...

942
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:22,882
I know this. I told them this.

943
00:36:23,076 --> 00:36:25,914
I swear, when they come back into town, I will do better.

944
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:26,865
I’m going to school.

945
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:28,769
They may not be back in town for several months.

946
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,920
- Whenever. 
- Whenever?

947
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:32,882
So I can make another lunch date with my parents

948
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:34,495
even though it’s several months away?

949
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,050
- Sure, make it. 
- Okay, I’ll make it.

950
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:39,353
Tell ‘em I’ve gotten some medication, I’m much better now.

951
00:36:39,476 --> 00:36:40,250
I’ll do that.

952
00:36:41,453 --> 00:36:42,784
- Get off the phone! 
- What?

953
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:44,197
I need the phone, get off the phone!

954
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,673
- What’s the matter? 
- Someone stole my car.

955
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,080
Nicole, I’m gonna have to call you back.

956
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:48,498
What do you mean somebody stole your car?

957
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:51,018
I parked it right around the corner and now it’s gone.

958
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,185
Why would you park it around the corner?

959
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:53,701
Because that’s where I parked it.

960
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,197
How the hell can the police department have an answering machine?

961
00:36:57,285 --> 00:36:58,278
Look, let’s just calm down.

962
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:00,321
Who would steal that car? It hardly ran.

963
00:37:00,424 --> 00:37:02,457
Well, you know these chop shops, they can make a buck out of anything.

964
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,529
I am gonna kill whoever did this. I’m gonna find them and kill them.

965
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,448
Listen, just go on over to school, I’ll take care of anything.

966
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:08,550
No, I gotta talk to the cops.

967
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:11,335
I’ll do that, go. You know, you don’t wanna be late to your first class, right?

968
00:37:11,423 --> 00:37:12,375
Well, yeah, but...

969
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:13,485
I mean, you were planning on going to school, right?

970
00:37:13,578 --> 00:37:14,080
Right.

971
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:17,239
Okay, well, then just walk on over to school and I’ll take care of the rest.

972
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:18,248
Fine.

973
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,526
All right, have a good day. Study hard, don’t worry.

974
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:22,072
Just leave the car to me.

975
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:31,719
Happy birthday dear Lorelai,

976
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:35,755
happy birthday to you.

977
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:39,759
You can take the cake into the kitchen now, Teresa.

978
00:37:39,912 --> 00:37:41,693
Wait, aren’t I supposed to blow them out?

979
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:42,836
Oh, Teresa can do that.

980
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:46,061
Mom, it’s tradition for the person whose name is on the cake to do the blowing.

981
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,553
Oh, I’m sorry, I thought only children liked to do that.

982
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:50,766
Should we bring it back out and relight it?

983
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:51,551
No.

984
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:54,028
Well, would you like to make a wish and blow out the tapers?

985
00:37:54,131 --> 00:37:55,492
Why am I being mocked on my birthday?

986
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,033
Because that’s the Gilmore way.

987
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:59,686
Let’s move into the living room for our dessert, shall we?

988
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,603
Let’s shall.

989
00:38:04,488 --> 00:38:06,101
- How’re we doing on time? 
- We’ve got time for cake.

990
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,554
Are you sure? ‘Cause I don’t wanna miss the fancy party you’re throwing me.

991
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:09,945
Don’t worry, it’s not that fancy.

992
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:11,555
What are the two of you whispering about?

993
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:13,438
- Nothing. 
- Champagne?

994
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,911
Trying to get me drunk so I forget

995
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:17,723
that you wouldn’t let me blow out my own candles?

996
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:19,860
Oh, dear, is this going to be another one of those stories

997
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,661
that you tell people for the rest of your life like the bunny story?

998
00:38:22,748 --> 00:38:23,951
His name was Murray, Mom.

999
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,454
Oh, Emily, you had to bring that up.

1000
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:29,747
How could you think I wouldn’t notice you gave away my rabbit?

1001
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:31,938
Because you were four and terrified of the thing.

1002
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,185
I was not terrified, I simply respected his space.

1003
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,336
You slept in the maid’s room for a week.

1004
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,724
I wonder where Murray is now.

1005
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,976
In a shoebox somewhere, I assume.

1006
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,183
- Grandpa. 
- Very nice, and on my birthday.

1007
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:46,127
Once again, a toast to Lorelai on her 36th birthday.

1008
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:48,686
- 35th. 
- Really?

1009
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,155
You’re doing the math?

1010
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:52,240
Right, sorry.

1011
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:55,133
To Lorelai on her 35th birthday.

1012
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:58,723
Thank you for the toast, thank you for the dinner,

1013
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:00,401
and, in the spirit of the evening...

1014
00:39:00,786 --> 00:39:03,146
Mom, I have something for you.

1015
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,892
For me? It’s not my birthday.

1016
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:06,029
I know, but here.

1017
00:39:06,757 --> 00:39:08,538
- What is this? 
- It’s from Murray.

1018
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:10,295
It’s taken him this long to write it partially

1019
00:39:10,468 --> 00:39:12,819
‘cause of the hurt and pain and partially ‘cause he has paws.

1020
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:15,476
- What is this? 
- That is what I owe you.

1021
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,863
- What you owe me? 
- For Rory’s school.

1022
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:20,511
I promised you I’d pay you back and now I have, every cent.

1023
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:23,489
Thank you again for helping us out.

1024
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:26,059
There’s no way Rory would be going to Yale

1025
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,451
if it wasn’t for this money, if it wasn’t for you.

1026
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,614
You’re welcome.

1027
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,051
- Okay, so... 
- You must be very relieved.

1028
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:33,009
Excuse me?

1029
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:34,570
Your debt is paid, you owe us nothing.

1030
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:35,579
Well, yeah.

1031
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,757
You don’t need us anymore.

1032
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:38,456
I didn’t say...

1033
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:39,759
You don’t have to deal with us.

1034
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:41,559
You don’t have to come over for Friday night dinners.

1035
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:43,571
It all works out beautifully, doesn’t it?

1036
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:45,230
- This isn’t about that, Mom. 
- Oh no?

1037
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,703
No, I owed you money and I paid you back.

1038
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:48,696
I don’t want it.

1039
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,415
I can’t believe you’re mad that I’m paying you back.

1040
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,833
I’m not mad, I just think it’s extremely unkind of you

1041
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:57,653
to use this occasion to inform me you won’t be coming over anymore.

1042
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:59,538
- I didn’t say that. 
- This says that!

1043
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:01,309
Mom, let me ask you something –

1044
00:40:01,478 --> 00:40:03,932
wouldn’t you rather we came over here because we wanted to,

1045
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:06,175
not because of some threat you’re holding over our heads?

1046
00:40:06,384 --> 00:40:08,171
Oh, and you would come here voluntarily?

1047
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:11,576
I always said I would pay you back. This is not a surprise.

1048
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,780
No, it certainly isn’t.

1049
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:14,941
I was trying to do a good thing here.

1050
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,779
When Dad gave me the money,

1051
00:40:16,912 --> 00:40:19,088
one of the first things that jumped into my head was to...

1052
00:40:19,195 --> 00:40:21,888
When Dad gave you the money? When Dad gave her the money?

1053
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,696
- Now, Emily... 
- You gave her this?

1054
00:40:23,825 --> 00:40:25,996
- It was her money. 
- It was from that investment, Mom.

1055
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:27,557
I’d appreciate it if you’d stay out of this.

1056
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:28,596
Why are you mad at me?

1057
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,767
I told you not to tell your mother about that money.

1058
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:32,417
- When did you tell me that? 
- At lunch.

1059
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:33,655
- You did not. 
- I did, too.

1060
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:36,093
Dad, I swear you didn’t tell me not to tell Mom.

1061
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,953
Why do you think I met you in the day at a restaurant, Lorelai? Think.

1062
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:40,911
I...

1063
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:42,242
You kept this from me, Richard?

1064
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,261
- I knew you would be upset. 
- You lied to me.

1065
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:46,662
I had to give it to her. I was legally obligated.

1066
00:40:46,763 --> 00:40:48,899
You’re also legally obligated to your wife.

1067
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,496
- Mom...
- Don’t you talk to me!

1068
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,143
- Now, you’re overreacting. 
- Don’t you talk to me either!

1069
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:55,284
- Don’t be mad at Dad. 
- Stay out of this!

1070
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:56,338
- I just...
- Well, don’t!

1071
00:40:56,446 --> 00:40:58,458
Mom, please. Just because I gave you this money

1072
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:00,752
doesn’t mean we’re never gonna come over here again.

1073
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:03,854
We will come over. Maybe not every week,

1074
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:07,214
but there will be the occasional Friday night dinners.

1075
00:41:07,307 --> 00:41:08,551
- No, there won’t. 
- Grandma...

1076
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:11,028
I don’t need anybody doing me any favors.

1077
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,405
You are released from your obligation, Lorelai.

1078
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:16,241
Have a nice birthday, have a nice life, I’m going to bed.

1079
00:41:18,218 --> 00:41:19,452
- Dad...
- Not now!

1080
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,845
You’re quiet.

1081
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,924
I know they were upset, hon, but trust me, they’ll calm down.

1082
00:41:39,058 --> 00:41:39,969
Why did you do that?

1083
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:41,165
Excuse me?

1084
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:42,886
Just giving them that check like that.

1085
00:41:43,198 --> 00:41:44,427
Rory, I borrowed that money.

1086
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:47,468
I know you did, but you had to have known that they’d get upset.

1087
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:49,383
You had to know that Grandma would take it personally.

1088
00:41:49,522 --> 00:41:51,166
What would you have me do, not pay them back?

1089
00:41:51,268 --> 00:41:52,155
- Maybe. 
- Maybe?

1090
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:53,235
Well, they didn’t want the money back.

1091
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:54,812
- It’s not the point. 
- Well, it’s kind of the point.

1092
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:56,563
No, Rory, it’s not the point at all.

1093
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:57,940
They were throwing you a party, Mom.

1094
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,302
Sorry, did I miss something?

1095
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:02,395
Did I dance around saying “nyah, nyah, nyah” when I gave her the check?

1096
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:02,978
No.

1097
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:05,625
Did, did I not thank her – genuinely thank her for everything?

1098
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,291
Yes.

1099
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:09,260
Did I not credit your getting into Yale with them giving us that money?

1100
00:42:09,368 --> 00:42:11,006
- Yes, but... 
- No buts.

1101
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:13,552
Listen Rory, I’m not sure if you’re aware of how hard it has been

1102
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:16,613
for me these past three years to be indebted to my parents.

1103
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:20,284
I decided a long time ago that I was gonna live my life without their help,

1104
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,670
but I went to them and I took their money

1105
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:25,251
and I’m not sorry I did, it was the right thing for you,

1106
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:26,972
but I don’t need their help anymore.

1107
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:30,090
Fine, but you don’t have to just throw it in their faces like that.

1108
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:32,655
I paid back a loan. You’re supposed to pay back a loan.

1109
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:35,180
I have Polonius and then entire banking system on my side.

1110
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:36,752
I just think you could’ve done it differently.

1111
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:37,602
How?

1112
00:42:37,873 --> 00:42:39,343
- I don’t know. 
- Take a shot.

1113
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:40,377
I don’t know.

1114
00:42:40,546 --> 00:42:42,651
Rory, my relationship with my parents is very different

1115
00:42:42,742 --> 00:42:44,074
from your relationship with them.

1116
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:45,937
You only know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily,

1117
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:48,082
and I only want you to know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily

1118
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:50,202
because they’re your grandparents and they love you,

1119
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,933
but I have a different history with them

1120
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:55,436
and it was not all warm and it was definitely not all fuzzy.

1121
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:58,534
So do not judge me for repaying a loan

1122
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:00,710
that I always intended to repay,

1123
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:03,194
that I told them from the beginning I would repay,

1124
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:05,267
that I had to repay.

1125
00:43:05,426 --> 00:43:07,468
I will not let them make me feel guilty for doing that

1126
00:43:07,602 --> 00:43:09,921
and I will not let you make me feel guilty for doing that either.

1127
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:11,836
I’m sorry.

1128
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:12,943
It’s okay.

1129
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:24,100
Oh my God. What is that?

1130
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,105
The world’s largest pizza.

1131
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:28,252
Almost.

1132
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:31,903
That is amazing.

1133
00:43:32,732 --> 00:43:33,377
You like it?

1134
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:35,990
I love it.

1135
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:38,317
Thank you honey.

1136
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,235
Hey, what happened to Kirk?

1137
