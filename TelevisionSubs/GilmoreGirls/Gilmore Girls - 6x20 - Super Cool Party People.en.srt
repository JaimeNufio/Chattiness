1
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:06,593
Is there something long and sharp
sticking out of my head?

2
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:07,299
No.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,138
I want there to be. There's an effect.
I need a cause.

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,580
The cause was 10 giant shots
of tequila, sweetie.

5
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,433
It makes me woozy just hearing that.

6
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:17,142
Well, that's the price you pay for
being the hit of Lane's wedding.

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,478
Hit? I was a raving lunatic.

8
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:22,163
And that toast-- Oh, my god!
Loudest sound ever.

9
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:22,842
Sorry.

10
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:25,100
Don't worry about the toast.
And you weren't a lunatic.

11
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:26,966
You were a character.

12
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:30,196
What is Stars Hollow if not a haven
for colorful characters?

13
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,842
You're not up there with Stevie
the pantsless Santa Claus

14
00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:35,690
or Jojo the cow whisperer,
but you made some strides.

15
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:38,015
Is this supposed to be a consolation?

16
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:39,388
That's twice in 20 seconds, Fred.

17
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:40,243
Sorry.

18
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:42,276
I've seen you wasted before
but never like this.

19
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:46,741
We had you guzzling coffee, but coffee
was making you energetically wasted.

20
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:50,313
I should borrow the reception video to
see what a fool I made out of myself.

21
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,502
And check out your audition.

22
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:52,528
My what?

23
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:54,135
You want a piece of me, omelet boy?

24
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:57,786
Why don't you let the vegetables simmer
for a while? I'll look after them.

25
00:00:57,787 --> 00:00:59,334
Sure, Sookie.

26
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:01,708
Sorry, Fred. I'm not myself this morning.

27
00:01:02,732 --> 00:01:05,443
So, now,
what did I do in front of the camera?

28
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:08,483
When you spotted the videographer,
you got suddenly very excited

29
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:11,284
to film your audition tape for
"America's next top model."

30
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:12,564
- Oh, my god!
- Yeah.

31
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:14,536
- I thought that was a dream.
- It wasn't.

32
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:16,861
The posing, the strutting,
the inappropriate gyrating?

33
00:01:16,862 --> 00:01:20,151
All caught on video and several of
Zach's buddies' camera phones.

34
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:21,330
Why didn't you stop me?

35
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,457
I tried. We all tried,
but you were on a mission.

36
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,533
You kept saying,
"I'm not here to make friends.
I want to win."

37
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:29,116
- And then after that--
- There's an "after that"?

38
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:31,564
You tried to start a limbo contest,
a poker game,

39
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:34,934
and a secret club for supercool
party people only.

40
00:01:34,935 --> 00:01:37,854
None of those really took off,
especially the limbo,

41
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:41,595
considering your choice of limbo stick
was Zach's great-uncle's cane.

42
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:43,185
Oh, yeah, is he okay?

43
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,830
He stumbled, but we caught him. He's fine.

44
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,477
So, is that all?
Anything else I need to know about?

45
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,895
Nope, after you crowned yourself
arm-wrestling champion of the world,

46
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:54,441
Christopher and Rory scooped
you up and got you home.

47
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,578
He got you in bed okay?

48
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:57,905
Christopher? Yeah. He and Rory.

49
00:01:57,906 --> 00:02:00,698
He's very "knight in shining
armor," very chivalrous.

50
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:02,009
That's him.

51
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:06,389
So, is there anything else I did that I need
to know about? I want to be fully informed.

52
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,771
- I told you everything.
- Good.

53
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:10,651
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go
and be nauseous out front for a while.

54
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:14,866
Excellent. Supercool party people
bid you supercool adieu!

55
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:18,273
That's how you were saying goodbye
to people at the wedding.

56
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,533
Super.

57
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,416
Excuse me, I'm looking for Logan Huntzberger.

58
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:22,031
Excuse me, can you help me find Logan--

59
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:23,599
Sorry, this isn't my floor.

60
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:27,480
Excuse me, can someone here help
me find Logan Huntzberger?

61
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:30,263
He was just transferred out of the I.C.U.,
room 713.

62
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:31,002
How is he?

63
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,558
- Are you family?
- I'm his girlfriend.

64
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,724
All I can tell you is that he's
not conscious right now

65
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:36,898
and that he's in serious
but stable condition.

66
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,569
What does that mean, "serious but stable"?

67
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,510
Just what it says.

68
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,088
But is it more serious or stable? I mean,
which way is it leaning?

69
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,694
I'm sorry, I can only release more
information to family members.

70
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:47,993
But I'm his girlfriend. I mean,
we've been together a long time.

71
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,934
It's not a casual thing. We live together.

72
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:51,196
Sorry.

73
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:57,550
How is he? Is he okay?

74
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,044
Scuttlebutt is he's not dead.

75
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:00,268
The man is indestructible.

76
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,423
Dives headfirst off the cliffs of Caldera,
instantly spins out of control.

77
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:05,713
Gets totally disoriented,
barely gets his chute open.

78
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,726
Bounces off every rock and crag in the park.

79
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,370
Yet still manages to stick the landing.

80
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,543
We gave him a 9.7.

81
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:12,403
Had to deduct.
3 for all the screaming and bleeding.

82
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:13,922
What about his family? Did you talk to them?

83
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:16,210
Honor is on her honeymoon in Mykonos,
trying to get a flight back,

84
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:19,920
and Logan's mom checked herself into some
sort of spa in Arizona the moment she heard.

85
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:22,557
When the going gets tough,
the tough get hot-rock massages.

86
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:23,465
What about Mitchum?

87
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,810
The Dark lord?
We left word but haven't heard anything back.

88
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,274
But we've come up with a plan to get around

89
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,711
the whole "family only gets
information" thing.

90
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:30,752
We're adopting him.

91
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:31,311
What?

92
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,597
Logan will make a fine son.

93
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:34,067
Of course, first we must be married.

94
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:35,899
Naturally, darling. I'm very old-fashioned.

95
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,173
And even then,
adopting as a gay couple is never easy.

96
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:39,249
We just want to give love.

97
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,078
- Oh, Finn.
- Oh, buttercup.

98
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,835
What the hell is wrong with you two?

99
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:46,954
Your best friend is lying unconscious in
a hospital, and you don't even care.

100
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:47,358
Rory...

101
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,758
Why the hell aren't you two lying
unconscious in there, huh?

102
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,128
Come on.

103
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:53,468
You don't care, because if you did,
you wouldn't be like this. You couldn't.

104
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:55,619
You're supposed to have his back,
you're supposed to watch out

105
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,736
for each other on these
stupid trips of yours.

106
00:04:57,737 --> 00:05:00,572
But no, everything's a big joke.
Everything's hilarious.

107
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:03,512
You're useless. Just go home. Both of you,
go home.

108
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,191
I can't stand to look at you.

109
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,174
- Hi.
- Hello.

110
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:17,783
I'm Rory Gilmore. I'm his girlfriend.

111
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,404
I'm Dr. Schultz.

112
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,881
How is he? Is he gonna be okay?

113
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:25,011
I'm sorry,
but I really can't get into the specifics.

114
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:27,762
Well, he's out of the I.C.U.,
so that's good, right?

115
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:30,428
They wouldn't have moved him up
here unless he was recovering.

116
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,005
Sorry, really.

117
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:34,580
But he's had surgery, right?
Does he need more surgery?

118
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,062
Does he have broken bones?
Because I can donate blood if you want.

119
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,237
Miss.

120
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:41,482
You really...
You can't tell me anything about what he has

121
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:44,113
or what you've done or what's
wrong-- anything?

122
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:47,550
I'm sorry. It's hospital policy.
We're doing everything we can.

123
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:49,671
Okay.

124
00:05:56,227 --> 00:06:00,108
# A million hearts, a million minds #

125
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,875
# Have lived and died in 40 years #

126
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:07,580
# Prayed for yourself and for your memories #

127
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:12,787
# Be thankful we've had 40 years #

128
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,384
# We've had 40 years #

129
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,782
# We've had 40 years #

130
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:28,671
# We've had 40 years #

131
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:30,638
I will get that for you in
two shakes of a lambstick.

132
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,611
Caesar, why am I still finding
bananas in the fridge?

133
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,903
Oh, you wanted me to take all the
bananas out of the fridge?

134
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:38,580
Yes. When I said, "remove the bananas,"
I was referring to all the bananas.

135
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:41,555
Otherwise, I would have said "banana,
or some of the bananas."

136
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:42,889
What?

137
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,805
It's just that while I was running the place,
that was one of my innovations--

138
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,536
cold bananas. People really love them.

139
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:50,057
I highly doubt that.
And get rid of those scones.

140
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:52,680
You know, that's something else I wanted
to talk to you about, Luke.

141
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:54,086
- What?
- Your attitude.

142
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:57,835
See, while I was running the place,
people really responded to my sunny demeanor.

143
00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:59,841
Customers find you cold and distant.

144
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:02,666
Service with a smile-- it's
a cliché for a reason.

145
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,393
Look, Caesar, I don't want to improve things,

146
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:07,047
and I don't want to stop
being cold to customers.

147
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,262
I just want you to keep my damn
bananas out of the damn fridge,

148
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,501
and I want to keep my damn doughnuts
in the damn doughnut case.

149
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,422
- Can you do that for me?
- Of course, Luke.

150
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,312
Thank you.

151
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:17,369
Customers don't care for gratuitous
profanity, either.

152
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:21,249
Thank god, someone sane.

153
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,794
Hello, weary traveler.

154
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:24,318
It's good to be back.

155
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,363
You look older, wiser.

156
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,976
Well, I did spend a lot of time squinting
at historical documents.

157
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:32,307
That's what it is-- constitution face.
Hi, Patty.

158
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,670
I brought you something.

159
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:36,120
Oh, did you steal me the constitution?

160
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,240
'Cause that could be the start
of a really dumb movie.

161
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,506
It's from Amish country.
These little Amish girls handmake them.

162
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:43,441
Oh, it's adorable.

163
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,438
Look, Patty, an Amish voodoo doll.

164
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,751
I love it.

165
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:48,986
Hey, Luke,
I'm still waiting on my cold banana.

166
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:50,267
We don't serve cold bananas.

167
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:51,824
It's not a voodoo doll. It's just a doll.

168
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:55,011
The Amish don't put faces on
their dolls or pins in them.

169
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:57,316
Oh, well, it's my doll now.

170
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,045
What the Amish don't know won't hurt them.

171
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,831
Unless, of course, I want to hurt them.

172
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:02,963
It's yours to do with what you will.

173
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:05,743
So, you seem surprisingly rested
after all you've been through.

174
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:08,850
Yeah, the kids were okay.
They seemed to like me,
unless they were all lying.

175
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:09,854
Kids never lie.

176
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,071
And April and I finally
got into a good rhythm.

177
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:13,872
She was tolerating me pretty good at the end.

178
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:14,405
Good.

179
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:17,166
And guess what? It's her birthday tomorrow,
and I'm throwing her a party.

180
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,485
You're kidding. How did that happen?

181
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:22,018
Well, I was dropping her off this morning,
and her mom mentioned to me

182
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,323
that she was taking her to her
grandmother's to celebrate,

183
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:26,671
and she couldn't swing a party
here with her friends,

184
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,738
so I figured I know her friends now.
I got a great place to hold a party.

185
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:31,624
Yeah, where?

186
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,856
Here.

187
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,149
So, anyhow, there you go.

188
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,180
Look at you, diving into fatherhood.

189
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,188
I'm doing my best.

190
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:39,343
So, tomorrow, huh? You prepared for all that?

191
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,021
Sure. Why?

192
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:44,643
Well, if you need a consultant, I have thrown
some rockin' preteen parties in my time.

193
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:46,266
Of course, I didn't have a deep fryer.

194
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,648
I think I can handle it.
I'll put up some decorations.

195
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,734
I've ordered some balloons.
I got a great cake place. It'll be presents.

196
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:55,890
All good. I'm just saying that Rory's
birthday scavenger hunt of 1998

197
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:58,849
is still talked about in hushed,
reverent tones.

198
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,458
Is that the one where all the kids ended
up at Taylor's at 11:00 at night

199
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,877
stealing stuff out of his fridge?

200
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,613
Shh! Hushed, reverent tones.

201
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:07,688
Yeah, I've got it all under control.

202
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:09,025
Excuse me.

203
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,443
What can I get you, Kirk?

204
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:14,163
How about a steaming cup of chicory coffee?

205
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:15,396
It's not on the menu, Kirk.

206
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:17,021
I know. It's on the sign.

207
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:18,961
That's a mistake.

208
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:23,379
Well, now all I can think about is chicory
coffee. I'm very susceptible to signage.

209
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,474
Well, come back when you're susceptible
to ordering off the menu.

210
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,140
You want anything?

211
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,909
How about a nice plate of chicken fingers?

212
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,161
Why don't I start you off
with some coffee, hmm?

213
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:37,819
Uh, no, thanks. I'm kind of coffee'd out.

214
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:40,716
Oh, right. Battling the hangover.

215
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:43,094
Oh. Did I mention my hangover?

216
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,371
No, Patty filled me in, you know.

217
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,814
The tequila shots, you taking the mike.

218
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:50,298
Taking the mike. Uh, yeah.

219
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,298
I, um-- I really didn't know
what I was saying--

220
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:55,293
just empty,
meaningless words tumbling out of my mouth.

221
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,325
I hear you really belted it out.

222
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,534
Belted it out?

223
00:09:58,535 --> 00:09:59,745
"Endless Love."

224
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,277
The song, honey.

225
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:03,802
Ohh... yeah.

226
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,563
Oh, yes. I really belted it out.

227
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,640
Is there any other way to
sing "Endless Love"?

228
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:12,435
You know,
if you're not gonna really belt it out,
you might as well stay in your seat.

229
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,034
She sang it beautifully.

230
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:16,435
Everybody does embarrassing
stuff at weddings.

231
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:17,491
Yeah, right, true.

232
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,890
Be right back.

233
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:22,628
Okay, I've already gotten to the whole town,

234
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:25,829
and they're all telling the "Endless
Love" story. He'll never know.

235
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,804
Oh, thanks. I owe you, Patty.

236
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:31,189
Honey, please. I've given more drunken
toasts than Colin Farrell.

237
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,173
You owe me nothing.

238
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,491
Thanks, Patty.

239
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:35,099
That Luke.

240
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,255
It may take a mule team,
but you're getting him to the altar someday.

241
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:40,687
Yeah, someday.

242
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:56,822
What?

243
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,640
Paris?

244
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,011
Larry Summers is right, Rory.

245
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:01,096
Our university system is crumbling,
did you know that?

246
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:01,541
Paris...

247
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,231
I just found out my microbiology
final is an open-book exam.

248
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:05,224
Can you believe that?

249
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:06,772
I mean, why have us take the test at all?

250
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:08,774
Why not just have our professors
take it for us?

251
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:10,851
Or better yet,
they can just hand us our diplomas

252
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:12,594
the moment we step on campus freshman year,

253
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:14,697
along with some government cheese, a bong,

254
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:16,929
and a t-shirt that says "hard
work is for suckers."

255
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,493
Paris, I'm at the hospital with Logan.

256
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:20,467
Why? What happened?

257
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:23,397
He and his buddies went on some stupide
Life and Death Brigade trip,

258
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:26,467
and they parachuted off
a cliff in Costa Rica,

259
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:27,919
and he had a really bad fall.

260
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,459
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

261
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,554
He's out of the I.C.U.,
so I guess that's a good thing.

262
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:35,332
They said he's in serious
but stable condition,

263
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:37,541
but they won't tell me anything
else because I'm not family.

264
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:38,624
Is he breathing on his own?

265
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,459
Yeah-- I mean, I think so.

266
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,324
What's his pallor? Is he peaked?
Was there internal bleeding?

267
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:46,707
I have no idea. I quickly scribbled
down some things off his chart.

268
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,351
You're pre-med, can I read it to you?
Maybe you can make some sense of it.

269
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:51,573
Forget it.
I don't know how to read charts yet.

270
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:53,410
I can tell you everything you wanna
know about the difference

271
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,901
between recessive and dominant eye-color
genes in fruit flies,

272
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:59,626
but god forbid I learn how to read a chart
before I'm a fourth-year surgical resident.

273
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:00,257
Great.

274
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:01,436
What hospital is he in?

275
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,287
Columbia-Presbyterian, Manhattan.

276
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:04,064
Who's the attending?

277
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:06,882
Paris, it doesn't matter. They're not gonna
release information to nonfamily.

278
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:07,760
Just give me the name.

279
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:08,963
Dr. Schultz.

280
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:10,079
I'll call you right back.

281
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,292
Paris.

282
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,752
Please!

283
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,311
That language is certainly not necessary!

284
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,198
Hold on.

285
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,515
It's about Logan Huntzberger.

286
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:27,872
This is Dr. Schultz.

287
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,812
No, that's not possible.

288
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,261
Well, you wouldn't do that.

289
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:34,737
Listen, miss-- fine.

290
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,175
Hello?

291
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:51,791
Here is the deal. He was bleeding internally
when they brought him in,

292
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,911
and they were worried about the
oxygen levels in his blood,

293
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:56,274
but he's stabilized now,
and they're back up to normal,

294
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,032
so that's no longer a concern.

295
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:59,404
He was also running a high fever,

296
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:02,726
so they put him on mondo doses
of intravenous antibiotics.

297
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,260
He has a partially collapsed lung...

298
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,310
Oh, my god!

299
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:09,929
...Six broken ribs, a broken ankle,
torn cartilage in both knees,
and a severe concussion.

300
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,841
He had surgery for the lung,
and that went well.

301
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:15,275
They did a thoracoscopy, which is a couple
of small incisions in the chest.

302
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:19,595
Then they put a tube into the lung
to drain the fluid from the poral
space so the lung can re-expand.

303
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:22,800
That's way less invasive than a thoracotomy
which is a similar operation.

304
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,871
But for that one,
they have to butterfly you like a shrimp.
And that's it.

305
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,004
So, what does this mean?

306
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,623
It means he's out of immediate danger.

307
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:31,372
He's young and healthy,
and they expect him to make a full recovery.

308
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:35,868
Really? Like a full recovery,
like he's going to recover fully?

309
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:37,104
That's what the doctor told me.

310
00:13:37,105 --> 00:13:40,407
He'll need some rehab,
he won't be running, dancing,
or jumping off a cliff anytime soon,

311
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:42,327
but, yeah, he should be fine.

312
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:44,776
He's a very lucky guy. He could have died.
Those guys are idiots.

313
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:45,994
- Wow.
- Yeah.

314
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:48,707
Thank you so much for this. Really, Paris,
thank you.

315
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,510
It was fun. Anything else?

316
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:51,772
No, I feel a lot better.

317
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,104
Call me if you need anything else.

318
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:54,363
I will.

319
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:56,634
So, you all shopped out?

320
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,596
I got a couple more stores in me.

321
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:01,361
You would make the best
sherpa and the hottest.

322
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:04,681
You could move to Nepal,
open your own hot-sherpa shop,
and make a fortune.

323
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:08,729
This is fun for me. Besides, I like to think
I have some influence on what you buy.

324
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,588
- You do?
- I don't?

325
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:12,159
- No.
- Yes, I do.

326
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,913
No, you don't.

327
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:14,037
- I do.
- You don't.

328
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:15,606
But you're always asking my opinion.

329
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:18,052
Yeah, but it's the way I ask.
"Isn't this adorable?"

330
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:19,842
Or "this isn't right, right?"

331
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:22,643
You know, I put your answer right
there in the question.

332
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:27,723
I will say, I do always like to buy one
thing that you like that I don't

333
00:14:27,724 --> 00:14:30,220
'cause I know it makes you happy,
like that blouse.

334
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,737
You know, I thought you liked that.

335
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,263
Not really,
but I liked how much you liked it,
so I bought it.

336
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:38,703
And I will wear it because I
know that every time I do,

337
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:41,922
you'll notice and appreciate it,
and that will make me feel so good.

338
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,131
And then because I feel so good,
I'll start wearing it more and more,

339
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:47,082
and I'll eventually really grow to like it,

340
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,197
and I'll forget that I didn't really
like it in the first place.

341
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:52,736
Holy crap,
you've picked out all my favorite clothes.

342
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:54,141
I knew it.

343
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:55,206
Hey, what do you think of that?

344
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,039
- What?
- The toiletry kit.

345
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,470
What? And throw away the 5-year-old dixie cup

346
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,584
you use to hold your toothbrush?
It's historical.

347
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:03,600
I mean as a birthday present for April.

348
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:05,827
- April who?
- Come on, it's cute.

349
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:08,125
Um, yeah. I don't think it's quite right.

350
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:09,687
It's girly. It's got cats on it.

351
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:12,614
- Oh, well, if it's got cats on it--
- April likes cats.

352
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:15,874
Yeah, but it's a toiletry kit.
It's so hygienic.

353
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,604
I saw her use soap on the trip.

354
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:19,782
Yeah, did you see her tie her shoelaces?

355
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,101
'Cause you could get her shoelaces.

356
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:22,294
I think she'll like it.

357
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:26,365
Luke, it's weird. It says,
"happy birthday-- now go clean yourself up."

358
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:28,713
If she doesn't like it,
I'll get her a follow-up gift.

359
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:30,930
Why not just get her the perfect
gift right up front?

360
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,111
Why couldn't that be the perfect gift?
You don't know.

361
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:34,813
I know girls. It's not the right gift.

362
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:38,483
Hey, you know, there's a store a few
blocks down that has great stuff.

363
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:41,559
I could take you there and show you
50 things I know she'd like.

364
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,079
Some of them may even have cats on them.

365
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,068
I think I'm gonna get that.

366
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,127
Come on, Luke, I can really help you here.

367
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:50,178
I'm not saying you can't,
I know you're an expert,
but I need to do this.

368
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:53,173
Then do it. I'm just saying,
let me be part of it.

369
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:54,470
No.

370
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:56,206
Why?

371
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:57,714
Because it's too soon.

372
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:58,927
Why is it too soon?

373
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:03,213
Because the minute you get involved in
her life, it'll be all over for me.

374
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:05,038
What? That's ridiculous.

375
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,492
No, it's not ridiculous.
You're colorful and funny.

376
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:11,803
You're practically a cartoon character.
Kids love you.

377
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,263
I wouldn't hang out with me
either after meeting you.

378
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:14,907
Luke--

379
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,440
She'll like you better. That is just a fact.

380
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:18,623
No, you're her dad.

381
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:22,360
Yes, I am her dad,
and this is the way I want it to be.

382
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:23,073
Okay.

383
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:24,305
I'll be a couple of minutes.

384
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:25,885
I'll be right here.

385
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,207
So you have my cellphone
if there's any problems?

386
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,911
I've got your cell number, your store number,
your store fax number,

387
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:36,540
your home number. You are 100% reachable.

388
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,164
Good.

389
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:39,513
And, hey,
thanks again for letting me do this.

390
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:41,691
Oh, please. She's excited about this.

391
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:43,915
Plus, your chaperoning got rave reviews.

392
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:44,399
Really?

393
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,555
April said you were by far the
least-embarrassing parent on the trip.

394
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,422
Good. That's good, right?

395
00:16:49,423 --> 00:16:50,769
It's a rave.

396
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,315
Her friends call you Hagrid.

397
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:54,352
Really? Hagrid. Wow.

398
00:16:54,353 --> 00:16:56,068
I don't know what that means.

399
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:57,789
He's a character from "Harry Potter"--

400
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,391
very big, very hairy, very lovable.

401
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:01,834
It's a huge compliment.

402
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:03,888
I will take your word for it.

403
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,401
So, I'm gonna go now.

404
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:07,978
Have fun, and I'll talk to you later tonight.

405
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:08,695
Will do.

406
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,888
- I'm going, April.
- Yeah, yeah, bye, mom.

407
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,922
- That was from the heart.
- Totally.

408
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,335
Bye again.

409
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,821
And the diner looks really great.

410
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:18,708
I was here when you opened it, remember?

411
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,041
I remember.

412
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,369
Bye.

413
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:28,049
Okay, can I get everyone's attention
for a moment here?

414
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,284
Just go ahead and pull your chairs
around so everyone can see me.

415
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,269
Is this a game?

416
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,957
No, no games right now. Just gather.

417
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,895
All right, I'm Luke. Some of you know me.
I'm April's dad.

418
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,817
So, um, before we get the party started,

419
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:48,849
I just wanted to lay down some ground rules--

420
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,522
some simple dos and don'ts--

421
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:54,412
so that everybody has a good time
and goes home in one piece.

422
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:55,701
Okay.

423
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:59,983
So, this is the party area.

424
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:03,250
You are to remain in the
party area at all times.

425
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,308
The kitchen is strictly off limits.

426
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,917
Under no circumstances are
you to enter the kitchen.

427
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:10,515
It's incredibly dangerous back there.

428
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:12,723
One turn of the wrong dial,
you could burn your face off.

429
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,664
And I've got so many knives back there,
you so much as trip,

430
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:18,549
you could lose an arm,
you could chop off fingers,
you could poke out an eye.

431
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,832
And do not go upstairs.
That is not part of the party area.

432
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,903
Everyone must remain in the
party area at all times.

433
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:29,473
And finally, do not go outside.

434
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:32,631
I will not give anybody permission
to go outside, okay?

435
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:33,716
Are we clear?

436
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:36,304
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

437
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,233
Well, good, then that's all I've got.

438
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:39,574
So have fun.

439
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,138
Is he serious?

440
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:47,189
Is that our website?

441
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,705
It is.

442
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,354
What happened to it?

443
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:52,466
I made some modifications.

444
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,354
It's just a big picture of you.

445
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:57,722
Well, I figured since I'm the one
who put the website together

446
00:18:57,723 --> 00:19:00,964
and I'm the one continuously
updating the website,

447
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:04,579
then I should be featured prominently
on the website.

448
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,292
Featured? Sure. But where's the Inn?
All I see is your face.

449
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:11,148
Aha! If you want to hear about the Inn,
you click on my mouth.

450
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:15,410
See? And if you want pictures of the Inn,
you click on my eyes.

451
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:19,942
And if you want to post something about
the Inn, you click on my ears.

452
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,769
Clever, no?

453
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,751
You want to argue about this now or later?

454
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:26,613
Later. I'm having too much fun.

455
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:28,565
Hello.

456
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:29,663
It's me.

457
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:31,146
Hey, how is he?

458
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:34,396
Well, I'm told he's going to be fine,
but he looks awful,

459
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:37,337
and he's been unconscious the whole time
I've been here. It's really scary.

460
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:38,398
What happened?

461
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:41,265
He basically jumped off a cliff,
and his parachute barely opened.

462
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,254
Oh my god!

463
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:46,115
Yeah, he has six broken ribs,
a collapsed lung,

464
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:50,111
a broken ankle,
contusions over 1/3 of his body,
and a concussion.

465
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:52,318
Wow. Who else is there? What other family?

466
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,125
Colin and Finn were here for a while,
but none of his family's here.

467
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:58,047
How did you get all that information? I
thought they only allowed family members to--

468
00:19:58,048 --> 00:19:59,434
- Paris.
- God love her.

469
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:02,799
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner.
I got your messages.
I've just been so overwhelmed.

470
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,233
I'm just glad to hear from you.

471
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:06,544
Is there anything I can do,
anything you need?

472
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:08,899
It's been a while since I've
sent out a care package.

473
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,463
You could be up to your eyeballs in mad libs,
silly string, malted milk balls.

474
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:13,857
No, I'm good.

475
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,481
Colin and Finn went back to New
Haven to get some stuff for me.

476
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,335
I'm just gonna hang out here for a while.

477
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:21,052
Logan is awake if you want to see him.

478
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,150
Mom, Logan's awake.

479
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:23,804
Okay. Call me if there's anything you need.

480
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,339
- Thanks, bye.
- Bye.

481
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,764
- Hey.
- Hey.

482
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:33,881
You're awake.

483
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:37,145
Or hallucinating-- pretty good hallucination.

484
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:38,440
Oh, you're awake.

485
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:40,078
I must look like crap.

486
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,878
Now I know why you never let
me see you without makeup.

487
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,979
I guess maybe base jumping with very little
preparation wasn't the hottest idea.

488
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,504
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna make a full recovery.

489
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:52,546
Hey, Robocop made a full recovery.
Look where that led him.

490
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:54,286
This is the best hospital in the city,

491
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:58,067
and the best hospital in New York City is
basically the best hospital in the country,

492
00:20:58,068 --> 00:21:00,854
and that's basically the best
hospital in the world,

493
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:05,292
so all in all,
you're in the best place you could be,
all things considered.

494
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:08,368
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
Lay down.

495
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,930
I'm really sorry about this.

496
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:14,015
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

497
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:16,644
I was showing off.
I knew it wasn't safe from that cliff.

498
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:19,494
I was so drunk,
I was lucky I pulled my chute at all.

499
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:22,560
You're going to be fine, and I will be
here as long as you want me to be.

500
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,997
I've located the gift shop
and the good cafeteria--

501
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:26,622
"good" being a relative term--

502
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:29,549
and the maternity ward, in case I want
to play a little practical joke,

503
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,338
swap the newborns around.

504
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:34,447
What about the paper, school?

505
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:37,054
I have my laptop.
I can stay on top of my schoolwork.

506
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:38,716
And Bill can run the paper for a while.

507
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:43,039
I don't want you to miss too many classes.
You've already got more than enough
to do without having to sit here

508
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,281
Shh. Logan, just relax.

509
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:48,000
Get some rest. I'll be here.

510
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:50,278
I'm glad.

511
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:02,879
So, how we doing? We having fun?

512
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:07,257
Marcia, you have to discard.

513
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:09,933
I know, but you only need one card,
and I don't want to give it to you.

514
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,811
What makes you think I only need one card?

515
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:15,686
Oh, please. You pick up a card and discard
like every half-second. It's so obvious.

516
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:18,729
Well, it's my birthday. Why don't you
just give me the stupid card I want?

517
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,147
Hey, how do you think the temperature is?

518
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:23,541
It's fine, I guess.

519
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,657
Are you cold? Maybe it's too cold in here.

520
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:28,284
How many people are cold, huh?

521
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:30,185
Anyone too warm?

522
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:33,399
Okay, well, good to know.

523
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,917
Luke, can I go to the bathroom?

524
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:39,276
Of course. You don't have to ask permission
to go to the bathroom.

525
00:22:39,277 --> 00:22:42,345
But it's in the restricted area.
I could lose a finger.

526
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:45,341
Well, the bathroom is not part
of the restricted area.

527
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:46,624
I didn't mean to include that.

528
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,829
Does anyone else have to go to the bathroom?

529
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,265
Oh, well, all right.
Well, let's line up, okay?

530
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:55,156
You can use the bathroom one at a time.

531
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:56,450
Laura, you first.

532
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:57,907
Thank you.

533
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:02,762
Uh, I'll be right out. I just have
to check on something in the back.

534
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:08,502
Dragonfly Inn.

535
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:09,485
It's a disaster.

536
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:10,358
What?

537
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,252
The party-- it's a total disaster.

538
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:13,564
A disaster? Why?

539
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:15,697
Nothing happened.
It's like a funeral hall in there.

540
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:18,270
I didn't know 13-year-old girls
could be so unhappy.

541
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,801
Where are you? I don't hear anything.

542
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:22,175
I'm in the storage room.
I come in here and hide a lot.

543
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:23,801
And leaving them unsupervised?

544
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,920
Well, there's a peephole
here I can see out of.

545
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:28,172
You're peeping at the girls
from the storage room?

546
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,931
I do not have time for any weird jokes.

547
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:32,632
Okay, what are they doing?

548
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:37,795
Well, April was playing cards. Some of the
others were reading and playing video games.

549
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:41,455
At the moment,
they're all just standing in line,
waiting to go to the bathroom.

550
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:42,941
You didn't plan any activities?

551
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:45,378
It's a birthday party.
I thought that was the activity.

552
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:47,171
Oh, Luke.

553
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:50,604
Is it normal for kids to fall
asleep at a birthday party?

554
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:51,727
Luke, listen. Are you listening?

555
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:52,364
Yes.

556
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:54,162
Go upstairs and get your clock radio.

557
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:58,508
Why, so we can watch the minutes
of the world's worst birthday
party tick off one by one?

558
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:02,615
No. Go, get it, bring it downstairs and put
on some music-- KC101. I'll be right over.

559
00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:03,574
You're coming here?

560
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:07,509
Just stall for time,
I have some things to finish up,
and then I'll come over, if it's okay?

561
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,252
What?

562
00:24:08,253 --> 00:24:10,003
Is it okay that I come over?

563
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:11,702
Yes, Lorelai, come! Hurry!

564
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:12,710
Okay, I'll hurry.

565
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:14,749
Hurry faster.
They might start leaving or something.

566
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,938
Okay, bye.

567
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,643
Hey.

568
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:23,248
So, it got worse after we hung up.

569
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:23,981
We got the radio?

570
00:24:23,982 --> 00:24:27,425
I forgot the radio part was broken,
and the buzzer alarm went off at one point.

571
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:30,217
But that didn't last long,
I think it's too late.

572
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:30,877
It's not too late.

573
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:33,150
I swear I heard the word "mutiny"
bandied around in there.

574
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:34,266
It's not too late. Let's get in there.

575
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,554
But where's the stuff?

576
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:37,931
- What stuff?
- The party stuff.

577
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:41,231
Oh, my god,
I left the circus elephants in my car,
and I didn't crack a window.

578
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:43,093
But seriously, where's the party stuff?

579
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:44,902
Come on, follow my lead.

580
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:48,283
Hey, everybody. I'm Lorelai Gilmore.

581
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:49,687
Thank you so much for your patience.

582
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,307
I'm really glad you guys waited to
start the party until I got here.

583
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,924
Oh, um, that's okay, Lorelai.
We didn't mind, right, girls?

584
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:01,139
Great. Okay, let's get this party started.
Where's the birthday girl?

585
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,780
Here.

586
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:04,265
April Nardini, front and center.

587
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,749
You know, I met you briefly.

588
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,372
You were filling salt and pepper shakers.

589
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,841
I remember you.
You were dressed in all black,
and you had really blue eyes.

590
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,083
They aren't quite as blue today but I
think that's just the light though.

591
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:14,849
These irises are all natural, baby.

592
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,514
All right, everybody,
line up single file behind us.

593
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,795
We already went to the bathroom.

594
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:20,568
Oh, I know, this is gonna be so much better.

595
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:24,072
Now, take the hand of the person in front
of you and the person in back of you.

596
00:25:24,073 --> 00:25:25,900
Luke, you pull up the rear.
I'll take the lead.

597
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:26,933
Sure. What is this?

598
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,713
Just follow me, everybody.

599
00:25:28,714 --> 00:25:31,694
No matter what, do not let go of either hand.

600
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:33,351
We're not allowed to go outside.

601
00:25:33,352 --> 00:25:34,350
Or in the kitchen.

602
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:35,801
Or anywhere else.

603
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:36,659
What?

604
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,123
You are now, girls. We got new rules.

605
00:25:39,124 --> 00:25:40,149
Should we bring our stuff?

606
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,337
No, leave it. We'll be back.

607
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:45,078
Everybody try to walk at the same pace.

608
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,293
You step on somebody's heels,
you could break an ankle.

609
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:49,946
And watch out for the traffic-- not
just cars, but bikes.

610
00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:52,419
People in this town ride their
bikes like maniacs.

611
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,137
- Luke!
- Sorry.

612
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:56,966
Oh, check for traffic. Always check. And go!

613
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:59,488
- Where are we going?
- No idea!

614
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:01,886
Serpentine, girls, serpentine.

615
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:04,224
Is this wise to serpentine?

616
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,863
No!

617
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:13,945
- Hi, Lorelai.
- Hi.

618
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,035
Hey, girls.

619
00:26:16,112 --> 00:26:18,768
All right,
I'd like you to meet the birthday girl.

620
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:20,633
Hi, April.

621
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:22,624
- Happy birthday.
- Hello.

622
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,287
You are adorable.

623
00:26:24,288 --> 00:26:28,376
All right, girls. I want you each
to take a basket and fill it up.

624
00:26:28,377 --> 00:26:32,221
I want you to pick anything you want because
today we're getting makeovers.

625
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:35,897
These two ladies are here to help
you in any way you need.

626
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:38,292
That's Alison and Leslie.

627
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:42,833
On your mark, get set, and shop!

628
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:45,716
You're a genius.

629
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:48,623
13-year-old girls and makeup-- it's
like betting on secretariat.

630
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:51,412
Never in a million years would I have
thought of something like this.

631
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:54,774
That's why I'm the yin to your yang,
the emack to your bolio.

632
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:57,281
Hey, who wants hot-pink highlights?

633
00:26:58,353 --> 00:27:00,371
I hate that you're cutting
your honeymoon short.

634
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:03,682
That's okay. With mom flaking out,
I don't want to be here anymore.

635
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:07,737
We've got seats on a flight tonight,
but it's got a 5-hour layover in Ankara,

636
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:09,725
so we're trying to find
something more direct.

637
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:11,531
Either way,
we should be there sometime tomorrow night.

638
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:14,750
Okay. So, have you heard anything
more from your dad?

639
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:16,275
Yeah, I just talked to him.

640
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:17,371
So is he coming down here?

641
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:18,225
Nope.

642
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:19,392
He's out of town, too?

643
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:21,802
No, he's home. He's just not coming.

644
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:22,367
What?

645
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:25,297
It's the Life and Death Brigade thing.
He's very against it.

646
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:26,919
But he was in the Life and Death Brigade.

647
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,992
Yes, but he feels that he knew when to
grow up and accept responsibility

648
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,446
and that Logan doesn't.

649
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:35,231
He wanted his precious boy done with
that by now, so he's boycotting.

650
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:37,259
He's boycotting his injured son?

651
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,001
Logan had emergency surgery.

652
00:27:39,002 --> 00:27:42,125
Hypocrisy runs very deep in
the Huntzberger family.

653
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:45,613
Anyhow, forget it.
I'm sure Logan isn't expecting him.

654
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:48,005
Okay, so, I'll call later when I
have more flight information.

655
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:49,656
Okay, bye.

656
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:04,761
Mitchum Huntzberger?

657
00:28:04,762 --> 00:28:06,633
Yes, it's Rory Gilmore.

658
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:10,215
I just thought I'd call and remind you
that Logan is lying in a hospital bed

659
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:11,798
with a partially collapsed lung

660
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,600
and a whole host of other potentially
life-threatening injuries.

661
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,054
And I'm figuring a guy like you,
surrounded by nothing

662
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:20,422
but a bunch of terrified sycophants might
not have have someone in his life

663
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:25,097
with the guts to tell him what an incredibly
selfish, narcissistic ass he's being,

664
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:26,642
so I thought I'd jump on in.

665
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:28,421
Swallow your pride, get in your car,

666
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:31,527
and come down here and see your son-- now!

667
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:34,722
That looks excellent.

668
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:40,469
Marcia, fabulous. You look like Sophia Loren.

669
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,053
I was going for Vanessa Minnillo on MTV.

670
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,613
Ah, I love her music.

671
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:45,750
She's a V.J.

672
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,110
No, well, you didn't let me finish,
I love her music-video introductions.

673
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:50,626
You know, she's so smooth and classy.

674
00:28:50,627 --> 00:28:53,079
- Luke, more chips here.
- Coming.

675
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,217
Lorelai, check this out.

676
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:57,691
Ooh, cool. Your eyes have eyes.

677
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:58,837
- Freaky, right?
- Yes.

678
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,354
You could fall asleep in class,
and no one would know.

679
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,997
Lorelai.

680
00:29:02,998 --> 00:29:05,947
Oh, April, you look beautiful.

681
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:07,772
Leslie says I have excellent bone structure.

682
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:09,083
Yes, well, I agree with her.

683
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:11,349
So it's not weird when someone
compliments your skull?

684
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,744
A woman takes any compliment
that comes her way.

685
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:16,296
Got it. Hey, did you do that
glitter heart on your cheek?

686
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,817
Happens to be my handiwork.
Yeah, you want one?

687
00:29:18,818 --> 00:29:20,667
- Yes.
- All right, sit, sit.

688
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,075
What color would you like-- pink,
blue, purple, florescent green?

689
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:26,810
Purple. I'm obsessed with purple,

690
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:29,471
probably because I'm obsessed with
"Harold and the purple crayon."

691
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,387
I know I'm too old, but it's still
one of my all-time-favorite books.

692
00:29:32,388 --> 00:29:36,120
That's okay. I'm too old for us weekly.
It never stopped me.

693
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:37,570
So, you have a daughter, right?

694
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:38,933
Yes-- Rory.

695
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:41,107
That's good. You'd be wasted on a son.

696
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:42,469
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

697
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,030
It is. You know, you remind me of my mom.

698
00:29:45,031 --> 00:29:46,557
Is she handy with the glitter?

699
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:49,808
She painted a mural on my wall
in nail polish one night.

700
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:51,233
That's cool.

701
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:53,326
I think you'd like her.

702
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,040
All right, you're all done.

703
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,146
Thanks.

704
00:29:57,514 --> 00:30:01,212
Oh my god, that is so cool. I love it.
Thanks, Marcia.

705
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,103
- She's loving her presents.
- I know.

706
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:04,953
Okay, how about this one?

707
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:05,902
It's from your dad.

708
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:11,172
You know, you don't have to open
up all your presents right away.

709
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:13,549
You could maybe save a few
and open them tomorrow,

710
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,216
sort of extend the experience.

711
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:16,649
Bad idea, Hagrid.

712
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,284
I don't want to extend the experience.

713
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,279
Wait, is that my gift?

714
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,558
It says it's from Luke.

715
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,169
The new "way things work."
I was gonna get this.

716
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,590
And a gift certificate to the discovery
store. Thanks, Luke!

717
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,116
I love it!

718
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:32,245
- Thank you so much!
- You're welcome.

719
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:36,298
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

720
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,849
You know what would really push
this party over the top?

721
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,618
If we made it into a sleepover.

722
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:42,730
Yeah, you've got sleeping bags and blankets.

723
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:45,462
Plus, I still got Jess' bed.
We could stick a couple of them on that.

724
00:30:45,463 --> 00:30:47,457
Why don't you ask the birthday
girl if she wants to do that?

725
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,024
April, come here a sec.

726
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,403
What's up?

727
00:30:50,404 --> 00:30:52,536
How would you feel about making
this a slumber party?

728
00:30:52,537 --> 00:30:53,868
- Really?
- Really.

729
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:55,456
Do you guys want to sleep over?

730
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:57,101
That would be really cool.

731
00:30:57,102 --> 00:31:02,103
Great. First off, we got to call all your
parents to see if it's okay with them. Okay?

732
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:03,894
So, with that in mind,

733
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:08,062
why don't we form a single-file
line behind here to the phone?

734
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:13,055
Or you could use your own, I guess.

735
00:31:14,764 --> 00:31:16,812
So, I think I'm gonna take off.

736
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:19,050
What? No, stay. You got to stay.

737
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:20,589
- You're sure?
- It's a slumber party.

738
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,974
You're the slumber-party expert.
What does Hagrid know about slumber parties?

739
00:31:23,975 --> 00:31:25,761
Would it be weird,
the two of us sleeping together?

740
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:28,207
You and the girls can sleep upstairs.
I'll figure something out.

741
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,293
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

742
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:32,144
You have to stay. April would want that.

743
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:33,382
Okay, I'll stay.

744
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:34,745
The movie's all ready to go.

745
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:35,743
Okay, thanks, Kirk.

746
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:38,666
I just need it back for the
Weinstein retirement party.

747
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,941
Mel Weinstein's a nut for John Hughes movies.

748
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:41,895
Okay.

749
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:47,929
All right, girls, um, you're about to
meet someone very special to me.

750
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,690
Her name is Molly Ringwald.

751
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:52,826
Now, I know you don't know who that is,
but suffice it to say,

752
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,896
she is my generation's Audrey Hepburn.

753
00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:57,747
And I know you don't know who that
is, either, but trust me,

754
00:31:57,748 --> 00:31:59,289
you're gonna love her.

755
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,210
And yes,
that is the guy from "Two and a half men."

756
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,717
All right, enjoy.

757
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:21,196
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

758
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:23,398
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

759
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:26,286
Light as a feather, stiff as a board...

760
00:32:28,432 --> 00:32:32,239
I forgot how much fun it could
be just to put makeup on.

761
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,832
It's become so pragmatic, such drudgery.

762
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,216
It's like all we use it for
now is to look better.

763
00:32:37,217 --> 00:32:39,553
And why would the two of us
ever need to look better?

764
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:42,955
Exactly. Whatever happened to the
questionably attractive glories

765
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:46,362
of wet 'n' wild blue eye shadow
or crimping irons?

766
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:49,910
Remember sun-in and aqua net
and bonne bell lip smackers?

767
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:52,071
I used to love bonne bell lip smackers.

768
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:55,175
Who doesn't love a lip gloss
that doubles as a necklace?

769
00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:56,707
And they smelled so great.

770
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,230
Except once,
I had the chocolate-fudge-flavored one,

771
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:02,255
and in study hall,
Trevor Fink ate the whole thing,

772
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:06,306
and then he threw it up all over my
copy of "The red badge of courage."

773
00:33:06,307 --> 00:33:08,827
We all had a Trevor Fink in our lives.

774
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:10,845
So, it sounds like the party was great.

775
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:13,541
It was a great party and
a major breakthrough.

776
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,099
April's awesome. I think she liked me.

777
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,078
I bet she loved you.

778
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,329
We bonded. Hopefully, this means things
will change and I won't have to hide.

779
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,532
- Good.
- Yeah.

780
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,269
Luke just needed that time and space,
you know?

781
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,033
And in hindsight,
I think it was good for him,

782
00:33:27,034 --> 00:33:29,016
and I'm really glad I let him have it.

783
00:33:29,017 --> 00:33:30,377
You were incredibly patient.

784
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:34,980
I was-- incredibly patient,
while at the same time incredibly impatient.

785
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:36,306
You're a complicated woman.

786
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:39,864
I am, yes. I try to deny it, but there it is.

787
00:33:39,865 --> 00:33:42,107
I'm kind of sad I wasn't at the party.

788
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:43,611
I feel like I missed out.

789
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:46,468
I thought you might feel that way,
so I brought you some leftovers.

790
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:47,965
Bonne bell lip smackers, anyone?

791
00:33:47,966 --> 00:33:49,453
- No!
- Yes.

792
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:53,868
I've got original, glitter gloss,
grape crush, and Dr. Pepper.

793
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,350
I feel like I'm 15 again.

794
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:58,592
Jackson's so getting under my bra tonight.

795
00:33:58,593 --> 00:33:59,731
Oh, my god!

796
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,933
Luke, there's some glitter on my pancakes.

797
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,682
Sorry about that. Let me fix that up for you.

798
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:08,987
Wasn't any glitter in the food
when I was running the place.

799
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:11,377
And cut up one of those cold bananas,
will you?

800
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:13,887
Excuse me, is Luke around?

801
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,984
Yeah, he's here. He's always here.

802
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:17,699
Hey, Anna, how are you?

803
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,191
Can we talk in private?

804
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,804
Uh, sure. This way.

805
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:23,427
Caesar, I'm gonna take a couple minutes.

806
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,833
Whatever.

807
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:28,219
So, what's up?

808
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,894
- I can't believe you did this.
- Did what?

809
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:32,315
You said you wanted to throw her a party,
Luke-- you.

810
00:34:32,316 --> 00:34:33,157
I know. I did.

811
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,021
No.
You had your girlfriend throw her a party--

812
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:37,965
a girlfriend I don't even know,
a girlfriend I've never even met.

813
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:39,360
This is not our agreement.

814
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:42,421
Wait a minute. I did throw the party.
Lorelai was just helping out.

815
00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:43,683
- Helping out?
- Yes.

816
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:45,399
April said you spent the night downstairs.

817
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,044
Well, I spent the night in the storage room.
I thought it were a little weird if--

818
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:52,135
So when you were in the storage room,
your girlfriend was upstairs with the girls.

819
00:34:52,136 --> 00:34:53,035
Yeah.

820
00:34:53,036 --> 00:34:56,275
How am I supposed to explain that
to the other girls' parents?

821
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:58,612
How am I supposed to tell them
that I left their kids

822
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:01,955
all alone with a woman I've never even met?
Who does that?

823
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:04,269
I'm sorry.
I didn't think that it was gonna cause--

824
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,257
If I can't trust you, Luke,
this arrangement is not gonna work.

825
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:09,657
April is not a sweater that you're borrowing.

826
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:13,453
She's my kid. I have to know where
she is and who she's with always.

827
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:15,595
I know. I'm sorry. You can trust me, I swear.

828
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:17,039
You know what?

829
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,070
I am too mad. I can't even look at you.

830
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:20,222
Anna.

831
00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:42,889
Hello!

832
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:44,212
Kitchen!

833
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,645
Thank god. I am so nutrition-deprived.

834
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:49,195
All I've eaten in the last two
days is cake, candy, cookies,

835
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:51,783
and about 10 pounds of flavored lip gloss.

836
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:53,420
Well, then, let's eat.

837
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:54,726
Good.

838
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:58,129
Now, do you want to be civilized and eat off
plates or just right out of the containers?

839
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,616
I know you don't approve, but I think
there is some sort of origami thing

840
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,456
happening with these containers that
makes the food taste better in them.

841
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:06,054
It's like feng shui for noodles.

842
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:09,571
I'm not just saying that because I'm
lazy and I don't want any cleanup.

843
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:10,672
That's only part of it.

844
00:36:10,673 --> 00:36:12,208
Out of the containers is fine.

845
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:13,607
Righteous.

846
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:16,975
You okay?

847
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:19,569
Anna came by the diner.

848
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,234
Why? What's up?

849
00:36:21,235 --> 00:36:23,335
She's mad. She's really mad.

850
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:25,223
- What about?
- The party.

851
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,033
Well, the party was a smash.

852
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:29,927
About you being at the party.
She says she feels betrayed

853
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:32,166
because I let you throw
April a birthday party

854
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,696
even though she's never met you.

855
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:35,237
But you were there the whole time.

856
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:36,439
We both threw the party.

857
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,213
I know, I told her that,
but I left you alone with them all night

858
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:42,756
and didn't clear it with her first.
She's really mad about that.

859
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,726
It's not your fault.
I should have seen this coming.

860
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,029
I was stupid. I didn't think it through.

861
00:36:48,816 --> 00:36:49,871
I'm sorry.

862
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:51,513
Yeah, me too.

863
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,008
I brought some beer,
but I left it in the truck.

864
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:56,277
Be right back.

865
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:05,249
Hey.

866
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:07,296
So, my dad just left.

867
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:08,663
I saw.

868
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:10,525
I still can't believe it.
He actually visited.

869
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:12,696
He was only moderately hostile,
slightly condescending,

870
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,542
and no more self-centered than usual.

871
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:16,744
It's good that he came. Good for him.

872
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,636
Are you feeling any better?

873
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:19,538
I am.

874
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:20,709
Of course, It could have something to do

875
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,212
with the 27 medications they
have me jacked up on.

876
00:37:23,213 --> 00:37:26,475
I checked with the doctor.
It's mostly cough syrup and baby aspirin.

877
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,668
What's wrong? I'm feeling better.

878
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:32,650
What?

879
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:34,634
I'm sorry.

880
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:35,486
About what?

881
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:38,078
About letting you go on this trip.
I should have stopped you.

882
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,376
I was just so busy being mad at you.

883
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:43,703
I didn't think I was trying to punish you,
but I was trying to punish you.

884
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:45,141
No, Rory.

885
00:37:45,142 --> 00:37:46,269
I should have stopped you.

886
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,701
Hey, you couldn't have stopped me.

887
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:50,164
A team of psychiatrists with tranquilizer
guns couldn't have stopped me.

888
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:51,821
I was going no matter what. It's my fault.

889
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:53,509
Do not feel guilty about this.

890
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,908
I just sent you out that door.
I didn't even care.

891
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:59,441
I was so cold.
I just-- I could have lost you.

892
00:37:59,442 --> 00:38:01,718
- You didn't lose me.
- But I could have, though.

893
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,574
Look, I'm the one screwing things
up with us here, not you.

894
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,869
I'm sorry you're in the hospital right now.
I'm sorry about all of this.

895
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,085
I don't what's going on with me,
but I'll get better, okay?

896
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:15,556
Things will calm down.
I just need you to bear with me, okay?

897
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,472
Okay?

898
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:19,648
Okay.

899
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,748
You okay there?

900
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:42,579
Sorry.
Spreadsheets-- the bane of my existence.

901
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:46,477
Combines my hatred of math with
my fear of little, tiny boxes.

902
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,270
Well, little, tiny boxes can be scary.

903
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:51,885
Unless, of course,
they contain big diamond earrings.

904
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:52,988
I hear you.

905
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:54,888
- Feel free to look around.
- Thanks.

906
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:56,165
Have you been in here before?

907
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,546
No, first time. It's lovely-- great stuff.

908
00:38:58,547 --> 00:38:59,793
Thank you.

909
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:02,320
All the hanging clothes over
there are 20% off--

910
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:07,062
some of my favorite stuff,
but come march 1st,
I can't sell a sweater to save my life.

911
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:08,280
Okay, I'll check it out.

912
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:10,580
You looking for anything in particular?

913
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,417
Uh, yeah-- you, actually.
I'm Lorelai Gilmore. I'm Luke's fiancé.

914
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:21,192
I wanted to apologize for the party.
It was my fault.

915
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:23,675
It just wasn't exactly what I was expecting.

916
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:27,884
I know, and I'm to blame for that, not Luke.
It wasn't his idea.

917
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:30,158
He was having a little trouble
getting the party going,

918
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,102
and I may have thrown myself
into it a little too much.

919
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:35,569
I just thought that we should
meet so you could see

920
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,614
you really have nothing to worry about.

921
00:39:37,615 --> 00:39:40,608
She's a 13-year-old girl.
I always have something to worry about.

922
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:44,069
Well, yeah, of course,
but I meant in regards to me.

923
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,942
Look, I'm sure you're a great person.

924
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:48,005
I am. I have references.

925
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:49,697
But I'm a single mom here.

926
00:39:49,698 --> 00:39:52,577
I can't play fast and loose with
the people in my kid's life.

927
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:53,947
I completely understand.

928
00:39:53,948 --> 00:39:55,770
I'm a single mom myself.

929
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,940
Okay, then you get it. I mean,
what if April decided she likes you?

930
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,383
What if she becomes attached to you?

931
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:03,321
What if you become her best
friend in the entire world,

932
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:05,505
and then one day, you just disappear?

933
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:06,921
Well, that's not gonna happen.

934
00:40:06,922 --> 00:40:08,383
You don't know that.

935
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:10,991
You can't guarantee that,
and I can't take that chance.

936
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,382
When it comes to my daughter,
I have to have rules--

937
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:14,612
hard and fast rules.

938
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:17,804
I would never dream of violating
any of those rules. Believe me.

939
00:40:17,805 --> 00:40:20,975
April never meets any man I date
unless I've dated him for years.

940
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:22,296
I totally get that.

941
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:25,371
So basically,
until I'm ready to get married again,

942
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,200
she doesn't meet any of the men I date.

943
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:27,931
Right.

944
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:29,697
For all she knows, I'm a nun.

945
00:40:29,698 --> 00:40:32,139
Yeah, I went through a sister
Wendy phase myself once.

946
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,998
I want her to have stability.

947
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:37,596
Right. But Luke and I-- we are engaged.
We are stable.

948
00:40:37,597 --> 00:40:38,863
Engaged isn't married.

949
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:40,485
People get engaged all the time.

950
00:40:40,486 --> 00:40:42,937
Look, this is not something casual,
Luke and me.

951
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:45,787
This is not something we're rushing into,
by any means.

952
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:48,643
This has been a long time
coming-- a long time.

953
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:50,722
This is real.

954
00:40:50,723 --> 00:40:54,273
That's wonderful. I'm really happy for you,
but that doesn't change anything.

955
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:58,099
Luke just came into April's life.
I'm still nervous about that.

956
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,037
He's not a kid guy, never has been,
and she's getting very attached.

957
00:41:02,038 --> 00:41:04,971
I need to know he's sticking around first.

958
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:08,398
And then, when you're married,
we'll deal with that then.

959
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:11,738
I'm not trying to be a hardass here.
April's my world.

960
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:15,025
I don't know if my way is the right way.
I just have to go with my gut.

961
00:41:15,026 --> 00:41:16,888
This is how I want to do it.

962
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,191
You said you're a single mom.

963
00:41:19,192 --> 00:41:21,150
I have a daughter, just like you.

964
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:23,387
You get where I'm coming from at all?

965
00:41:23,724 --> 00:41:25,402
I really do.

966
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:27,653
Anyway, thank you for hearing me out.

967
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:28,585
Sure.

968
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,547
It's no problem.

969
00:41:29,548 --> 00:41:30,821
Okay.

970
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:32,859
Hey.

971
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,993
If it makes you feel better,
she had a really great time at that party.

972
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,115
I'm glad.
