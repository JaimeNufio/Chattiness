1
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:03,772
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

2
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:04,837
I did what you said.

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:07,885
I had it worked out
and asked him if he'd like to go to dinner...

4
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:10,010
- at Chez Fleur on Sunday.
- Very nice.

5
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:12,419
He said he would love to,
but his cousin's in town...

6
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:15,651
- and is staying with him for the week.
- Then just make it next week.

7
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:17,784
- I came up with another option.
- Which is?

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,848
That we double-date.

9
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:20,895
No, I hate blind dates.

10
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:23,156
It figures that
the only Korean boy at this party...

11
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,289
has his Korean-girl radar turned on.

12
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:28,695
- I'm Henry.
- I'm Lane. This is Rory and Paris.

13
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,532
Thank you. You will not regret this.

14
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:34,970
Lorelai, this is my cousin, Rune.
Rune, this is Lorelai.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,597
Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

16
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:38,369
I can't believe you set me up with that.

17
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:40,137
Was the bearded lady busy tonight?

18
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:42,678
He speaks Korean fluently,
he respects his parents.

19
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:46,705
And he's also really cute, very funny,
and surprisingly interesting.

20
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:49,444
I'm sorry, but I'm totally failing
to see the problem.

21
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:51,781
I'm falling for a guy
my parents would approve of!

22
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:53,787
Tomorrow, if you have time...

23
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:57,017
I'm planning on despising everyone
who says, 'Hey, how's it going?'

24
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,421
You're on.

25
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,392
- Hey, how's it going?
- No, that's just too easy.

26
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,424
- Rachel.
- Your Rachel?

27
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:08,029
- You're Rachel?
- Yep, I'm Rachel.

28
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,462
- I have to get home.
- Stay for one more dance.

29
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:11,693
- I don't think...
- Yes.

30
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:12,962
One dance would be fine.

31
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:14,025
Great.

32
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:16,072
Please, don't let me drive you away.

33
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:18,231
You're not. I have to go sit in a closet...

34
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:23,208
- So, where's Rachel?
- She's a founder's party-punch junkie.

35
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:25,643
- Is she staying?
- I don't know.

36
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:29,114
- Do you want her to?
- I don't know.

37
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:33,451
Can I have some baby pictures
of you and Grandpa?

38
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,644
Any particular reason?

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,517
We're doing this visual
family-history project for school.

40
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,954
If it's for school, I could dig something up.

41
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:42,958
- I need some of Mom, too.
- I thought we had this conversation.

42
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,619
- Yeah, but I don't believe you.
- Mother, tell her.

43
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:48,425
- I don't have baby pictures of your mother.
- Thank you.

44
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:50,192
How could you not have baby pictures?

45
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:54,133
Because when she was seven, I found her
burning all of her baby pictures.

46
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:56,897
Why would you do that?
I'm sure you were a cute baby.

47
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:59,530
- She was very cute.
- Four, three, two, one.

48
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:01,506
- In most respects.
- Then we have lift off.

49
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:03,165
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

50
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:06,040
I don't see what the problem is.
You certainly grew into it.

51
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:07,099
Grown into what?

52
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,840
As a child, your mother
had an unusually large head.

53
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:12,347
The best thing about it was
she'd tell me constantly.

54
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,611
My first sentence was,
'Big head want dolly. '

55
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:17,174
- I can't imagine it being that bad.
- It wasn't.

56
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:19,050
It just affected her balance a little...

57
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:22,214
Can we talk about something
besides my formerly huge head?

58
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,654
Are these new chairs, Grandma?

59
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:25,885
- Why, yes, Rory, they are.
- They are?

60
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,086
I got them from a dealer
in Maine last summer.

61
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:30,561
- He just restored them.
- They look like the old ones.

62
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,154
- They're nice.
- Sure they're new?

63
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,858
- Of course. I bought them.
- I don't see any difference.

64
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:38,096
The arch in the back is higher,
and they have a different leg.

65
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,193
No difference.

66
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,966
I could only get 10,
so I'm two chairs short of a set.

67
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,062
You're telling me.

68
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,539
- Do you realize how rare these chairs are?
- No.

69
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:47,336
I've searched for three years for them.

70
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,173
I'd combed every fine antique store
on the East Coast...

71
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:53,077
and this is all I could find.
I blame Peg Mossley.

72
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,316
- Peg Mossley, evil woman.
- What did Peg Mossley do?

73
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,147
She lured two German children
to her gingerbread house...

74
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,210
and then she tried to eat them.
Pass the artichokes, please.

75
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,655
I made the mistake of telling Peg
all my favorite special spots...

76
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:08,556
and that woman moved in
and completely wiped them out.

77
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:11,651
You can't find a decent Biedermeier hutch
in all of Connecticut.

78
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:15,425
- I'm desperate for new sources.
- What about Kim's Antiques?

79
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,831
- What's Kim's Antiques?
- Didn't that burn down?

80
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:22,063
Lane's parents have
this great antique store in Stars Hollow.

81
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:24,502
Is that so?
Why haven't you ever told me about it?

82
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:27,439
I don't know, Mom.
I guess it just got lost in my big head.

83
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,771
Come to Stars Hollow
and I'll take you there.

84
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:31,640
Like Saturday.
You can come see the town.

85
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,338
- Won't you have to study?
- I can put it off for one day.

86
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,473
- I'm working.
- No one is asking you to do anything.

87
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,175
This is between Rory and me.

88
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,446
I accept your offer, Rory.
I would love to spend Saturday with you.

89
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,579
- Great.
- I'm just sorry that I'm gonna miss it.

90
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:47,955
Eat your artichoke, Lorelai.

91
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:50,232
Okay, French toast with crispy bacon.

92
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,432
Pancakes, two eggs over easy.

93
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,870
- What?
- You put the eggs on the pancakes.

94
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,076
It's like two eyes staring at me.
See, I can't eat it like this.

95
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:03,910
- Hence the 'oops. '
- What? You always order the same thing.

96
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:06,974
You put the eggs on the side
so my breakfast is not ogling me.

97
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:10,452
- It's the same food.
- Yeah, I need the eggs put on the side.

98
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:12,181
- You want a brand-new plate?
- Yes.

99
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:15,383
What if I take this in the back,
take the eggs off the pancakes...

100
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,755
I put the eggs on the side,
and bring the plate back?

101
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,987
- What happens then?
- I can eat my breakfast.

102
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:22,359
It's the same food,
just a different configuration.

103
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:25,661
- I won't know that.
- I'm gonna take the plate in the back.

104
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,560
So, what time
does the judgmental express arrive?

105
00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:31,501
Grandma gets here at noon.
Are you sure you won't do lunch?

106
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:34,734
- No, I can't. Lunch is bad.
- Lorelai, you're here.

107
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:37,338
- Good. Don't move.
- I won't.

108
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,636
What are you doing at lunch?

109
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,109
- I have very important things to do.
- Like what?

110
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:44,044
At noon, I have to not have lunch
with my mother.

111
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:45,137
Very nice.

112
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:49,207
I'm developing my pictures from
the Firelight Festival. Some amazing stuff.

113
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:52,776
I'm thinking maybe there's a book
here, Faces of Small Town America.

114
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,185
You can feel safe.
You don't live near these people.

115
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:59,351
Exactly. And the very last shot
on my roll was this.

116
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,961
- When did you take this?
- When you weren't looking.

117
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,189
- What's that?
- It's a picture of us.

118
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,891
- Us?
- Rachel took it.

119
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,696
- For the Firelight Festival.
- Sure. Yeah.

120
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:15,003
- So here's your plate. No eyes.
- Thank you.

121
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,839
- Do you wear contacts?
- Me? No.

122
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,837
God, you've got amazing eyes.
Doesn't she?

123
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,675
Yeah, sure, I guess.
I mean they're, you know, placed good.

124
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:31,417
Symmetrical.
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

125
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:36,119
- Mom, look at this.
- What is that?

126
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,884
It's an old abandoned inn I ran across
when I was exploring the other day.

127
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:43,187
This is Dragonfly.
I totally forgot about this place.

128
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,625
It doesn't look like
it's been operational in years.

129
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:49,095
Look at all the trees. It's pretty.
I'm buzzing.

130
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:52,690
- What've I said about buzzing in public?
- It's Lane. 911, that's trig.

131
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:54,359
- Gotta go.
- Bye.

132
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:56,034
- Take a...
- Yeah.

133
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:57,899
- Bye, Rachel.
- Bye.

134
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:02,769
- That is one really not annoying kid.
- Yes, she really is not.

135
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:04,604
I'll consider doing the mom thing...

136
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:07,076
if I could be guaranteed
I'd get one just like her.

137
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:09,169
You can. You just have to go to Sears.

138
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:12,511
- God! Where is this again?
- It's kind of behind the mill.

139
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,642
Go across a little footbridge
with the mean duck family under it.

140
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,812
Yes, the Armbrewsters.
It's really amazing.

141
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,553
- Do you want to see it?
- What?

142
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:23,146
The inn. I'm gonna head out that way
in a little while.

143
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:26,193
Come on, finish your breakfast.
I'll drive us out there.

144
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,090
Drive her out where?

145
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:30,493
Lorelai and I are going to cruise the docks.

146
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:33,793
To see how many sailors we'd get
to tattoo our names on their butts.

147
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:36,630
- What do you think?
- I have to check in at the inn first.

148
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:40,228
- That's great. Good. I'll pick you up there.
- Okay. Good.

149
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,901
- What was that all about?
- Nothing.

150
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:45,703
We're gonna check out
this old inn Rachel found.

151
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,810
- What?
- I didn't know you guys were friends.

152
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,779
We're not really friends.
I don't know her that well.

153
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,838
- We're just hanging out. She seems great.
- She is. She's great.

154
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,350
She's just a lot different from you.

155
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,149
- 'Cause I'm not really great?
- No, you're great, just in a different way.

156
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:04,745
- In a not really great way?
- That's not what I meant.

157
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:08,384
The two of you are just
completely different people. Both great.

158
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,086
But I'm just a little surprised...

159
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,823
that your different types of greatness
are melding...

160
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:16,297
and you're comfortably great together.

161
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:18,833
- Is this bothering you?
- This conversation, yes.

162
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:21,768
No, the idea of Rachel and I
hanging out together.

163
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:24,600
Is there some reason
that's weird for you or something?

164
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,138
- Why?
- No reason I can think of.

165
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,367
- Then it's not weird.
- I was just checking.

166
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,272
- Then you checked.
- Okay.

167
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,573
So are you gonna be pouring
that coffee anytime or...

168
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,012
I'm glad it's not weird, though.
That would be bad.

169
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,606
I'll get a rag.

170
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:41,646
Welcome, Moshira Motors,
to the Independence Inn.

171
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,482
The dining room is right through there.

172
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:46,147
And breakfast is served 6:00 to 11:30...

173
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:48,986
although our chef
is an amazing overachiever...

174
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:52,151
and she'll be happy to prepare
anything you want any time of day.

175
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:56,560
Now, your itinerary for the conference
will be in each of your rooms.

176
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,030
And if you have any questions at all,
just please feel free to ask...

177
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,532
No.

178
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,959
Somebody else. Not him.

179
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:07,730
Okay, so ask Roger.
Roger will be happy to help you.

180
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:09,295
Thanks so much.

181
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:21,278
- Rune is in the lobby.
- Lorelai! Hello! I made some coffee.

182
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,976
Rune is in the lobby.

183
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:27,713
I also made those orange-glazed muffins
you like, with warm cinnamon butter.

184
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:31,018
Sookie, Rune is in the lobby. Why?

185
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:32,819
- Muffin's getting cold.
- Muffin's fine.

186
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:35,519
My muffin wants to know
why the fruitcake's in the lobby.

187
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:37,118
- He's staying with Jackson.
- Again?

188
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:39,424
- Still.
- I thought he was only here for a weekend.

189
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:40,862
Yes, 'The Lost Weekend. '

190
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:44,161
Explain, Yoko, because he's out there
with the normal people...

191
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:46,134
- and he'll scare them.
- He won't leave.

192
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,395
- Jackson's house?
- Yes.

193
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,630
He won't leave, and it's driving me crazy.

194
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:51,831
- Tell Jackson to kick him out.
- He won't do it.

195
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,965
- Why not?
- Because he says it's family.

196
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:56,339
And somehow he feels
responsible for him.

197
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,503
Okay, but has Jackson met him?
I think that would change his mind.

198
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,637
Apparently, Rune had a rough childhood.

199
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:05,445
His parents, brothers, and sisters
don't talk to him. No one talks to him.

200
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,644
- What's wrong with Jackson?
- I don't know.

201
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,812
He's determined to stand by him
and I have to respect his decision.

202
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:12,822
- That part I can understand.
- Good.

203
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,357
What I can't understand is,
what's Rune doing here?

204
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:19,053
- Well, I don't...
- Lorelai! These are for you.

205
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,526
For me?

206
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,393
Yeah, and I also brought
some of my raspberry-peach jam.

207
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:26,194
- I think you'll like it. Put it on ice cream.
- Okay.

208
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:29,133
Take a graham cracker, spread some on,
add some chocolate...

209
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:32,330
throw it in the boiler,
and you'll sing show tunes all evening.

210
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:33,564
Must be good jam.

211
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,540
It's my way of saying thanks
for helping out Rune.

212
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,002
Thanks for helping out Rune.

213
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:42,973
- Okay, I'm doing the spoon signal.
- I didn't notice.

214
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:45,207
I'm waving around like an idiot here.

215
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:47,306
- You haven't...
- No. Yeah.

216
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:49,282
- So I should...
- Good idea.

217
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:50,544
Right.

218
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,984
Enjoy the jam.

219
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:58,289
Would you mind explaining
the thank-you jam?

220
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,552
I was supposed to ask you
something about Rune.

221
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:04,392
- Like what?
- He just, not too long ago, lost his job.

222
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,260
- Attitude problems?
- Something like that.

223
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:11,131
When he lost his job, he couldn't pay
his rent and so he got evicted.

224
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:14,364
None of this was known to us
when he came to stay with Jackson.

225
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:16,200
But this is the situation.

226
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:18,739
So I was thinking
if he could get another job...

227
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:22,641
and then he could save up some money,
afford his own place, and move out...

228
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:26,703
then I wouldn't end up stabbing him
in the neck with a grapefruit spoon.

229
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:27,974
It's gonna happen.

230
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:30,675
- You want me to give him a job?
- Nothing important.

231
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,808
Good. I was gonna
put him in charge of legal.

232
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:35,786
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I can't think of anything else.

233
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,084
- What can he do?
- Lots of things.

234
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,783
He's always fiddling around, using screws.

235
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,122
- Once I saw him use a hammer.
- A hammer?

236
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:45,956
He could be a handyman.
You've been looking for a handyman.

237
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,359
I couldn't pay him very much.

238
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,921
That's okay. Maybe he could just work
for room and board.

239
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,467
- You want him to live here?
- No.

240
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:56,094
- What about the old potting shed?
- The old potting shed?

241
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,330
Rory and I lived there
when she was a baby.

242
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:01,840
It has memories
and little rosebud wallpaper.

243
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:04,637
I don't want Boo Radley
touching my rosebud wallpaper.

244
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:06,803
A job is enough, you're right.

245
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,540
He can save up money
and eventually move out.

246
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:11,945
I'll just have to deal with it.

247
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:13,842
The potting shed's fine.

248
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,009
- Really?
- Yes.

249
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:16,210
I love you.

250
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:19,777
I swear to God, the minute the guests
start complaining or disappearing...

251
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:22,254
- he's out of there.
- More than fair!

252
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,258
- It's really good jam.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

253
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:34,692
- Grandma.
- Rory! Hello.

254
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,996
- What a lovely day to...
- Are you okay?

255
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:40,669
Guess putting in a walkway
never occurred to Lorelai.

256
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:44,037
It occurs to her every day
on the way to work. Here.

257
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:45,472
Thank you.

258
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,467
- Are your shoes okay?
- They're fine.

259
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,171
A little muddy, that's all.

260
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:57,013
- Here, give them. I'll clean them for you.
- You don't have to do that.

261
00:12:57,251 --> 00:13:01,584
My mom found this great shoe cleaner.
It gets out pretty much anything.

262
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,282
Do you want something to drink?
There should be iced tea.

263
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:06,255
Iced tea would be nice.

264
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:12,484
- Oh, my God! There's nothing in here.
- I know. It's a little sparse.

265
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:15,929
- It's The Grapes of Wrath.
- Don't worry. We eat fine.

266
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,867
No food, no drink.
Do you at least have plates?

267
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:20,424
Yes, we have plates.

268
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:25,102
- There are women in bikinis on them.
- The original Charlie's Angels.

269
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:27,197
It took us years to get a complete set.

270
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,037
You can find the Kate Jacksons
and Shelley Hacks pretty easily.

271
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,337
Even the Cheryl Ladds.

272
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,675
The Farrah Fawcetts and Jaclyn Smiths
are a little harder to find...

273
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,974
but still accessible.

274
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,107
The real trick is to find the Tanya Roberts.
We have three.

275
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:42,812
You have three Tanya Roberts?
And I was worried. Silly me.

276
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,781
How are you doing with those shoes?

277
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,913
- All done.
- That's amazing!

278
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:50,291
- What is that you used?
- I don't know.

279
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,622
We got it off
one of those late-night TV ads.

280
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:56,061
It also gets rust off nails and hinges,
waxes your car perfectly...

281
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,723
- and weatherproofs windows.
- Isn't that nice.

282
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:02,526
Okay, about today. I think I'll just give you
the grand tour of the town.

283
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,693
So we can start by walking
to Kim's Antiques...

284
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,396
which takes us by all the good sites.

285
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:09,201
I don't think I wore the right shoes
for the grand tour.

286
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:12,299
- Why don't we just drive?
- You can borrow my mom's shoes.

287
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:14,639
No, I don't think so.
Rory, hold on a minute.

288
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:17,111
You'll be missing
the true Stars Hollow experience...

289
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,942
if you don't walk. Trust me.

290
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:21,881
But I won't wear anything
with rhinestones or zebra stripes...

291
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,213
or anything that has batteries
or that sings...

292
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:26,185
or makes animal noises
or moves on its own.

293
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:27,810
Grandma, I got it.

294
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:40,161
It must have been something
when it was all fixed up and nice.

295
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:43,297
Can I ask what the fascination
with this place is?

296
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,257
Me and my friend Sookie...

297
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:49,862
we've been kind of toying with the idea
of opening our own place together.

298
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,964
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, someday.

299
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,668
Obviously not now. We're still saving up.

300
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:58,075
- Are you close?
- No, not at all.

301
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:02,904
- This looks like it could be a great place.
- Yeah, it really does.

302
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:06,017
God. A little paint, some pretty curtains...

303
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:09,346
$150,000 of construction,
and we're open for business.

304
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:11,978
Did you always want to own an inn?

305
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:14,421
No, I was still dreaming
of owning a red Camaro...

306
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:17,153
- when Rory appeared on the scene.
- Right.

307
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:20,318
It's a new idea
in the last couple of years, actually.

308
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:22,363
Did you always
want to be a photographer?

309
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:23,488
Not specifically.

310
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:26,499
I remember growing up thinking,
'I wanna be anywhere but here. '

311
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:27,931
That was you in the other room!

312
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:31,562
I made sure to pick something
that would keep me moving. Constantly.

313
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,765
- Sounds exciting.
- It is. Tiring, too.

314
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:38,800
Now that I'm here, back with Luke,
I don't know.

315
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:41,807
Things seem to be going pretty well
for you guys.

316
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,838
I guess. These last couple of weeks
it's become increasingly apparent to me...

317
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:48,542
things just can't continue
the way they've been.

318
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:51,984
- What do you mean?
- I think it's time we get serious.

319
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:56,981
I'm ready to 'settle down,' I guess,
is the creepy, old-fashioned term for it.

320
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,151
Pretty damn scary?

321
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,021
Pretty damn scary.

322
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,859
- I feel ridiculous.
- You look great.

323
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,528
- I look like a Clydesdale.
- You look comfortable.

324
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:15,832
- People are staring.
- Because you look great.

325
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:20,001
What a shame your grandfather isn't here.
He'd fall in love with me all over again.

326
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,578
- I think we came through the storeroom.
- Nope, this is it.

327
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,169
This is the antique store?

328
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:28,476
You have to dig,
but you'll find great stuff here.

329
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:32,075
This is ridiculous. No one can run
a quality business like this.

330
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:35,677
This place is dusty and disorganized.
And you can't possibly...

331
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:37,919
Now that is gorgeous!

332
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:42,281
Look at the woodwork. It's exquisite.
I wonder if it has a mate.

333
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,824
Grandma, look at this.
It's got little flowers all over it.

334
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:48,055
- It's very pretty.
- Is it something special?

335
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,358
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

336
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:51,558
Then it's something special.

337
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:55,392
Lane, this is my grandma.
Grandma, this is my friend, Lane.

338
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,937
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Nice to meet you.

339
00:16:58,005 --> 00:16:59,767
Can I talk to you for a sec?

340
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,831
Go. Talk. I have a lot of looking to do here.

341
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,001
- Problem.
- Hit me.

342
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:07,806
It's been a week since that party
and he has not called.

343
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,846
- He said he'd call.
- Maybe he's been busy.

344
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:11,642
Maybe he has a girlfriend.

345
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:15,318
A tiny, perfect Korean girl that his parents
will love and approve of.

346
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:18,581
You're a tiny, perfect Korean girl
that his parents will approve of.

347
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:20,314
- No, they'd know.
- Know what?

348
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:21,912
Know I listen to the wrong music...

349
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,219
and wish I could go blond
without looking bad.

350
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,486
That I'd take a WHOPPER over kimchi
in a heartbeat.

351
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,790
- Now you're just going crazy.
- He doesn't like me, he won't call.

352
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:32,457
It's not the end of the world.
I'll live. I'll go on.

353
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:35,227
There's always college,
unless my parents get their way...

354
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,496
and then it's,'I take thee, Jesus,
to be my lawful wedded husband. '

355
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,402
Lane, with all due respect to your fiance,
Henry will call.

356
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:42,631
No, he's not.

357
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:46,733
Then why did he talk to you all night
and follow you everywhere you went...

358
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,367
and ask you to dance six times?

359
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,309
- Was it six times?
- It was six times.

360
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:53,176
He didn't ask you to dance
because you're a good dancer.

361
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:56,375
To tell the you the truth,
and as much as I love you, you're not.

362
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,077
- Really?
- You're an embarrassment...

363
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:00,312
- to the art of dancing.
- Thank you.

364
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:03,352
That's mid-19th century.
Four different kinds of wood.

365
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:04,683
- Is it missing an inlay?
- No.

366
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:06,553
- I thought so.
- Perfect condition!

367
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,319
- How much?
- $3,500 for the pair.

368
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:09,757
- You must be joking!
- No joke.

369
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:12,887
- Nice, but not that nice.
- Not a better pair on the East Coast.

370
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:14,486
- $2,000.
- You're from Hartford.

371
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:17,590
Yes. It doesn't matter where I'm from.
I know they're overpriced.

372
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,293
- See the bottom.
- They're not signed.

373
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,859
- Look on the bottom!
- Are they signed?

374
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,733
- They're signed.
- Are they authentic?

375
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:25,772
- You have my word.
- Letter of authentication?

376
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,239
- That, too.
- It's like watching the Williams sisters.

377
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,071
- I wish we had popcorn.
- I won't take it.

378
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,769
- Then someone else will!
- Eventually.

379
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:32,970
- I can wait.
- So can I.

380
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,876
- It's my last offer.
- I'll think about it.

381
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,244
- I'll waive the tax.
- And throw in delivery.

382
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,082
We appreciate your business.

383
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,211
I like that woman.

384
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:44,349
And you know what? I like these shoes.

385
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:47,212
You're becoming one of us, Grandma.

386
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,822
- This way?
- Yeah.

387
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:51,222
Great. I love this street.

388
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:57,558
- May I help you?
- I need to know where my room is.

389
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:01,333
Are you sure you are in the right place?

390
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:04,267
Perhaps you want the YMCA
or the local bus station?

391
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:06,497
- You speak English?
- You have a reservation?

392
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:09,005
- I work here.
- I do not think so.

393
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:10,665
You see, we have standards.

394
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,437
And even if they were much lower,
you would still be poor boy out of luck.

395
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:16,410
I'm the new handyman. Lorelai hired me.

396
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,139
- You know Lorelai.
- I dated her.

397
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:19,909
- You did?
- Don't spread it around.

398
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:23,417
- It's not one of my shining moments.
- You've so many to pick from.

399
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:25,178
- You're rude.
- You've cut me to the quick.

400
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:27,982
- Out of here, teeny tiny man.
- I will only be pushed so far!

401
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,614
- And obviously, it's down.
- Rune, you made it. Great.

402
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:33,887
- Finally. Will you tell this guy who I am?
- This is Rune.

403
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,893
- You know him?
- He's our new handyman.

404
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:37,519
- See? Handyman.
- Be quiet.

405
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:38,857
Go build us another statue.

406
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,556
- You hired this man?
- Yes.

407
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:41,996
Did you date him also?

408
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:44,898
I didn't date him.
I didn't date you. It was one night.

409
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:47,732
- One night. You and him together?
- I'll explain later.

410
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:49,668
- I cannot wait.
- Yes.

411
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:52,832
Come with me.
I'll show you where you're gonna stay.

412
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,898
Could you ask your bellboy
to grab my stuff?

413
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,909
I sprained my shoulder
on the way over here.

414
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:59,070
- Relax. I got it.
- Great.

415
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:04,171
Move it, Rune.

416
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,314
So what do you think?

417
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:13,179
I think it's very nice.

418
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,588
Mom's office is right back there.
You have to see the dining room.

419
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,526
They got the chandeliers
from one of Martha Washington's houses.

420
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,721
- Do you spend a lot of time here?
- Yeah.

421
00:20:21,797 --> 00:20:23,559
I work here a couple afternoons a week.

422
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:27,465
And I help out with special occasions.
They have a lot of weddings here.

423
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:29,660
- I wonder where Mom is.
- Don't bother her.

424
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:32,796
- I'm sure she's busy.
- No, she'd want to say hi.

425
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,996
- Michel, where's Mom?
- Off with her boyfriend.

426
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:39,270
- What boyfriend?
- Small, dark, wanted in four states.

427
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:43,674
Do you know when she's coming back?
My grandma's here, we wanna say hi.

428
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:44,941
Your grandmother.

429
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:47,005
- Emily Gilmore.
- Michel Gerard.

430
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,455
We'd better go find Mom.

431
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:04,326
- It's been a pleasure meeting you.
- The pleasure is all mine.

432
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,321
What a charming man.

433
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,489
Mom, hi.

434
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:14,096
- Mom, hi.
- It's quite a place you've got here.

435
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:18,368
It's not really my place. I just work here.
I thought you were gonna go antiquing.

436
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:21,534
- We did, and then we had lunch.
- Really? Where?

437
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,702
- Teriyaki Joe's.
- You're kidding.

438
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:25,109
- She picked.
- You did?

439
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,373
It looked festive.

440
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,414
I can't picture you at Teriyaki Joe's...

441
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:31,314
or in jogging shoes.
What's up, working girl?

442
00:21:31,384 --> 00:21:33,112
Rory decided we should take...

443
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:34,948
the grand tour of the town, walking.

444
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,078
I hope you don't mind.
I also borrowed your socks.

445
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:39,646
I don't mind.
I wish I had a camera, but I don't mind.

446
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:41,054
I'm gonna show her the grounds.

447
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,854
Good. On the way, show her the gym.
Jump on the treadmill.

448
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,554
- See you later.
- Make sure you stretch first.

449
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,490
I just love your mother.

450
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,827
So the horses are up on that hill,
and the tennis courts are back there.

451
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:00,372
It's certainly impressive.

452
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:03,841
- And this is my favorite place.
- The tool shed?

453
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,275
- No, this is where we used to live.
- What?

454
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:08,676
When Mom and I moved here,
this was our apartment.

455
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:11,806
I know it looks small,
but it's really pretty. Come on.

456
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:15,014
See, we had our bed right there...

457
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,450
and Mom put up this pretty curtain
around the tub...

458
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,578
so that it looked like a real bathroom.

459
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:23,181
And we would just sit outside at night
when the inn would have parties...

460
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,351
and we'd just listen to music,
feed the ducks and...

461
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:27,887
Grandma?

462
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:31,061
- Grandma, wait. What's the matter?
- Nothing.

463
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:33,792
Did something happen?
Are you sick? Is it the teriyaki?

464
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:36,891
I'm fine. It's just getting late. I have to go.

465
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:41,833
- Do you mind?
- What? Sorry.

466
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:57,672
Good, you got my message.

467
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,914
- Hail the glory of the answering machine.
- Come on in.

468
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:04,820
I just developed some shots
of the Dragonfly I think you're gonna love.

469
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,949
- Maybe they can help inspire you more.
- Great.

470
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,384
I've never been
in Luke's apartment before.

471
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:13,554
Really? How long have you two
known each other?

472
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:17,999
Years, but our relationship is strictly,
'Please, can I have coffee?' 'No. '

473
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:20,535
'Come on!' 'No, it makes you short. '

474
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,435
Then let me give you the grand tour.
This is it.

475
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:31,843
It's not how I pictured it. Not that
I have been picturing Luke's apartment.

476
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,775
I haven't been picturing it at all.

477
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,245
- I know what you meant.
- Nice touch.

478
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,805
- Those aren't mine.
- You're kidding.

479
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,317
Nope. Frankly, a little too frilly
for my taste.

480
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:44,217
I'm gonna give him
so much crap about that.

481
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:46,352
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

482
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:51,188
Man, you guys live
in pretty tight quarters here.

483
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,886
This was originally his dad's office.

484
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:55,554
It was never really meant
for anyone to actually live in.

485
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,756
- But tell that to Luke.
- Exactly.

486
00:23:57,832 --> 00:23:59,992
Do you think about
moving to a bigger place?

487
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,862
- I don't think so.
- No?

488
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:05,267
Right, because tight quarters, romantic.
Hello, Lorelai.

489
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:08,305
I don't think romance
has a lot to do with it.

490
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:12,066
I'm not sure I'm gonna be
in Stars Hollow much longer.

491
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:14,110
- But I thought...
- I know.

492
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,441
I can't seem to make Luke believe
I really want to stay this time.

493
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:22,415
- Did you tell him all the stuff you told me?
- Till I was blue in the face.

494
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:25,111
You just have to keep trying
until he hears you.

495
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:28,781
I don't blame him.
I've given him no reason to believe me.

496
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:32,382
I just hoped that magically,
somehow, he'd, I don't know...

497
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:35,120
forget that I'd skipped out on him
a million times before.

498
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:37,252
- Have you told him you might leave?
- No.

499
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,193
- Are you going to?
- I don't know.

500
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:42,255
I feel I've been trying so hard
to make everything good.

501
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,630
But this town,
it's like living under a microscope.

502
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:46,895
Everyone here's waiting for you
to screw up.

503
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,993
No, that's not true.

504
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,628
- Miss Patty?
- Well, yeah.

505
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,639
I don't know how long I can stick around
waiting for Luke...

506
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,800
when I feel
I don't have a friend in the world.

507
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:57,366
If you can French-braid hair,
I'll be your friend.

508
00:24:57,445 --> 00:24:59,935
- Sorry.
- See you.

509
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:04,582
I cannot find your pictures here.
They must be in the bathroom.

510
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,108
So do not want to know why.

511
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:11,484
Listen, I know this is so not cool to ask,
but if the situation comes up...

512
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:13,112
and it's not too weird...

513
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,283
a little word of encouragement from you
might help a lot.

514
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,418
- Yeah, sure, if it comes up.
- Thanks.

515
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,491
What, you don't knock?

516
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,798
- What are you doing here?
- Rachel invited me.

517
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:32,667
- To look at some pictures.
- Good.

518
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,535
And go through your underwear drawer.

519
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:36,039
- Where is she?
- Freezing your bra.

520
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:37,472
- Where?
- In the bathroom.

521
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:38,531
Right.

522
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,045
- It's a nice place you have here.
- Thank you.

523
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:48,140
- I like the curtains.
- Yeah, Rachel picked them out.

524
00:25:48,217 --> 00:25:50,047
She's got good taste.

525
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:55,448
- I just had to put something in the safe.
- We were just...

526
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:59,084
- I told him about the underwear drawer.
- And the baseball-cap fashion show?

527
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,785
I'm gonna go now.

528
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:06,826
I think he's going to buy a matching rug.

529
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:15,735
- I like this song. It makes me gloomy.
- Gloomy's good.

530
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:19,168
- Really gloomy.
- Like, Joy Division gloomy?

531
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:23,006
- Nick Cave or Robert Smith gloomy?
- Johnny Cash gloomy.

532
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:28,276
So like a San Quentin-y, 'It's a long
road home, and my horse just got shot...

533
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:30,872
'but I still got my girl
by my side' gloomy?

534
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:32,383
You read my mind.

535
00:26:32,652 --> 00:26:36,451
- I'm deep in a Charlie Parker gloomy.
- Henry still hasn't called?

536
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:39,615
- No, he called.
- He did? Why didn't you tell me?

537
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:42,054
I didn't talk to him. He left a message.

538
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:44,116
I listened to it eight-and-a-half times...

539
00:26:44,194 --> 00:26:46,218
but then my mom came home.
I had to erase it.

540
00:26:46,296 --> 00:26:48,263
But I was so panicked that I broke it.

541
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:52,391
Which is better, because now all evidence
that a boy called me is in the trash.

542
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,990
Eight-and-a-half times.

543
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:56,035
It was a good message the first few times.

544
00:26:56,103 --> 00:26:58,195
Then I started parsing it for subtext.

545
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:02,037
- What did he say?
- He said, 'Hey, Lane, it's Henry. '

546
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:04,270
- Not a good start.
- How do you figure?

547
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:08,005
It's so gender-neutral. It's how you start
a conversation with a bowling pal.

548
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,137
He asked you bowling?

549
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,272
Then he said, 'It was fun
meeting you the other night. '

550
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:13,607
What?

551
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:16,709
He didn't say which night,
like he didn't remember which night.

552
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:18,913
Like he's mixing me up with another girl.

553
00:27:18,988 --> 00:27:21,717
For all I know, he thought
he was calling the hot blonde...

554
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,917
he met at a hopped-up night
at Balthazar's.

555
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:25,549
He's a 16-year-old Korean boy.

556
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:28,356
- Or so he led me to believe.
- What's the bottom line here?

557
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:30,919
The bottom line is that he wants me
to call him back.

558
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:34,262
But if I do that, then he's probably
gonna ask me out on a date.

559
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:37,166
And if we go on a date,
then it could lead to another date.

560
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:39,668
Then I'll have to introduce him
to my parents.

561
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:42,035
Then they'll like him
because he's Korean...

562
00:27:42,106 --> 00:27:44,801
and he's gonna be a doctor.
Once that happens, that's it.

563
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:47,273
It'll be over. He'll be hideous to me.

564
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:51,045
Now I'm a Lou Reed gloomy.

565
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:56,374
Hello?

566
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:59,442
- Rory, hello. Do you have a minute?
- Sure.

567
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,076
This will probably seem silly...

568
00:28:01,154 --> 00:28:03,917
but I was wondering
what your favorite color is.

569
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:07,687
I don't really have one. Blue, I guess.

570
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,091
- What about flowers? Do you like flowers?
- Sure.

571
00:28:11,162 --> 00:28:13,994
Which would you say you like better.
roses or lilies?

572
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:17,328
- Sunflowers.
- Sunflowers it is.

573
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,726
Now, what about music?

574
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:21,564
'NSYNC or 98 Degrees?

575
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:24,697
'NSYNC or 98 Degrees?

576
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:26,901
What kind of sick joke is this?

577
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:30,807
- I don't think I could choose.
- What about the Backside Boys?

578
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:33,843
- You mean the Backstreet Boys?
- Yes, that's it.

579
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:39,947
- I guess if I had to choose, I'd say'NSYNC.
- Wonderful.

580
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:42,276
- Are you writing this down?
- Maybe.

581
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,047
- What for?
- You'll see.

582
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:47,851
- I'm looking forward to dinner on Friday.
- Okay. Yeah, me, too.

583
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:49,254
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

584
00:28:50,726 --> 00:28:52,215
What was that?

585
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:55,426
Sounded like some sick take
on the Gallup Survey.

586
00:28:55,897 --> 00:28:58,091
- I gotta go.
- Call him.

587
00:28:58,198 --> 00:29:01,633
I already left him a message.
He's probably parsing it right now.

588
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:02,962
I'm sure.

589
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,795
Want some coffee?

590
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,366
Coffee would be great.

591
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:17,138
- Thanks.
- Watch the lid there.

592
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:23,245
It really looks different
from back here, you know?

593
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:26,619
All this is yours, as far as the eye can see.

594
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:28,848
Yes, it's quite an empire
I've built for myself.

595
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:32,687
I'm thinking of conquering the flower shop
next door and expanding the freezer.

596
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:35,090
I didn't mean to kick you out
of your own apartment.

597
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:36,627
- You didn't.
- You left pretty fast.

598
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:38,993
It looked like
you were talking girl-talk, so...

599
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:42,396
- Girl-talk? What's girl-talk?
- You know, pantyhose, nail polish.

600
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:44,524
- Curtains.
- Yes, that stuff.

601
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,564
You didn't like me being up there?

602
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,637
No big deal.

603
00:30:03,483 --> 00:30:05,643
This is the fascinating storage area...

604
00:30:05,718 --> 00:30:07,810
where fascinating acts of storage
take place.

605
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:10,547
- Yep, this is it.
- Some good-looking pickles.

606
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:12,781
- What are you doing?
- I'm admiring your pickles.

607
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:14,551
- You shouldn't be in here.
- Why not?

608
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:16,648
My insurance covers only me.

609
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:20,787
- That's not true. You're kidding, right?
- It's not safe. Something might fall.

610
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:23,126
You don't like me hanging out
with Rachel, do you?

611
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,221
Come on!

612
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,459
- Am I right?
- Hang out with anybody you want.

613
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,899
- Not my question.
- Well, that's my answer.

614
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:30,663
Well, we're eight.

615
00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:34,896
Just a friendly piece of advice:
Don't get too attached to her.

616
00:30:34,974 --> 00:30:38,101
She's got an interesting habit
of getting bored and then leaving.

617
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:40,336
Usually without saying goodbye.

618
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:42,709
- People break habits.
- Not often.

619
00:30:43,748 --> 00:30:46,477
You're just convinced
that's what she's gonna do.

620
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,278
I'll bet you that's exactly what she does.

621
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:52,320
Let's say it is what she does.
Don't you think it's possible...

622
00:30:52,387 --> 00:30:54,354
that if she leaves Stars Hollow this time...

623
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:57,585
it's because she thinks
you don't want her to stay?

624
00:30:57,658 --> 00:31:00,148
- Are you guys talking about me?
- No.

625
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:01,815
Yes.

626
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:05,728
Okay, I don't mind if you hang out
with her, but you will not talk about me.

627
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:08,891
Why? It's fun. We wear plaid,
take turns not shaving.

628
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,457
There will be no Luke-talk, period.

629
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,397
Want to know
what I think about the situation?

630
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:15,903
- No.
- Are you sure?

631
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,497
If you're gonna tell me,
at least help me unload.

632
00:31:18,574 --> 00:31:22,907
- Can I use the fun cutter thingy?
- Not if you call it 'the fun cutter thingy. '

633
00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:25,309
- Please?
- Cut the box, not your hand.

634
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,472
Good tip. You should teach.

635
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:31,245
- Fun!
- Talk.

636
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:34,583
I don't know what's going on in her head
as I'm no Vulcan.

637
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:38,384
But from the way she talks about you
and smiles when your name comes up...

638
00:31:38,457 --> 00:31:41,448
I'm pretty sure she's serious
about staying here this time.

639
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:44,926
Let me guess. Rachel told you
she wanted to put down roots...

640
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:48,760
that she's serious this time,
that she's tired of the road...

641
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:51,924
and realizes what's lacking
in her nomadic existence.

642
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:55,436
She didn't use 'nomadic existence,'
but basically, that's what she said.

643
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:57,629
I've heard the speech. I know it by heart.

644
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:59,137
I think she means it this time.

645
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:03,266
- You don't know her like I do.
- I don't, but she seems sincere.

646
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:07,675
- How do you know?
- Her nose didn't grow.

647
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:09,872
- Why are you taking her side?
- I'm not.

648
00:32:09,948 --> 00:32:13,439
- It sounds like you're taking her side.
- Wash out your ears. I am not.

649
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:17,282
- You're practically pushing her on me.
- I just want you to be happy.

650
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,819
You know what makes me happy?

651
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:22,618
No. I just know you've been carrying
a torch for her for a really long time.

652
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:26,387
- I have not been carrying a torch for her.
- You wanted this to happen.

653
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,519
- How do you know that I wanted it?
- Didn't you?

654
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:31,392
- Yeah, I guess.
- Okay.

655
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:35,860
So here it is, right in front of you.
Just take it.

656
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:41,129
Take the plunge. She could be ready.
Just jump in and believe her.

657
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,673
Unless, you know, there's some
other reason you don't want to.

658
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:47,106
Like what?

659
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:50,376
Like... I don't know.

660
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,309
There's no other reason.

661
00:32:56,384 --> 00:32:59,079
Okay. Fine. Then there's no other reason.

662
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:02,083
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

663
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:07,113
- Thanks for letting me borrow your thingy.
- You're welcome.

664
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,353
I'll see you later, Luke.

665
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:20,566
She actually asked
if you like the Backstreet Boys?

666
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:24,765
- Except she called them 'Backside Boys. '
- That is high comedy.

667
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,807
- What inspired that woman?
- I don't know. It was weird.

668
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:29,934
This sudden interest in pop music.

669
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,500
I sat her down
to listen to a Prince song once...

670
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,103
and she looked like
she was having a stroke.

671
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:38,180
- Wait a minute. I know what she's doing.
- What?

672
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,047
She's trying to be your pal now.
That sneak.

673
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,144
You spend one day together
and she wants to know all about you.

674
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:46,882
She's picturing you guys
chatting about boys...

675
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:49,287
and painting each other's toenails...

676
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,957
Hey, Kirk. Are you getting a cold?

677
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:55,723
You know, you should try
that Dyna-Meda-Chema-Themytol.

678
00:33:55,796 --> 00:34:00,061
Knocks it right out. But don't drive
your forklift. It'll make you drowsy.

679
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:05,804
When's the last time you think
Luke's been to a movie?

680
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:08,564
I think the guy
had to crank the projector by hand.

681
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:11,541
- Do you mind?
- Kirk, the movie hasn't even started yet.

682
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:14,133
I like to have silence
to cleanse my mental palate...

683
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:16,678
and achieve calm
before enjoying a motion picture.

684
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:18,737
You got that out of a book.

685
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:26,715
- Luke looks happy, doesn't he?
- Yeah, he looks happy.

686
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:31,018
- They seem right together, don't they?
- Just right.

687
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:32,887
Good. He deserves it.

688
00:34:34,294 --> 00:34:36,955
So I did the right thing
by butting in the way I did.

689
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:41,226
You butted in for all the right reasons.
You were concerned about a friend.

690
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:46,996
So, if Rachel turns out
to be an evil fembot...

691
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,266
and murders Luke in his sleep,
I'm not responsible, am I?

692
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,966
- Only in an intergalactic court.
- Good.

693
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,108
Rachel seems really great, doesn't...

694
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,511
You are now officially disturbing
not just me, but every person here.

695
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:04,140
You're the only one who's disturbed.

696
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:14,683
Hello?

697
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,359
Hello? Damn it!

698
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:34,539
- Hello!
- Mom, hi. Check the rubbing alcohol.

699
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,335
- How was the drive?
- It was fine.

700
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:38,602
- Good.
- The foyer looks great.

701
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:41,440
- I have a surprise for you.
- The rest of the house ran away?

702
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:43,775
No. Rory, come with me.

703
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:49,081
Okay. I'll follow you, then.

704
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:51,140
Great.

705
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:54,710
Voila!

706
00:35:55,223 --> 00:35:56,416
Oh, my!

707
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:59,657
Grandma, what is this?

708
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:01,421
- This is your room.
- What?

709
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:05,427
Since you spend so much time here,
I thought you should have a special place.

710
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,158
But you didn't have to do this.

711
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,199
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

712
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,427
Do you see the 'NSYNC poster?

713
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,993
- Thank you, Grandma.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

714
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,603
Now, come on, let's go downstairs
and see if dinner's ready.

715
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:22,377
- You coming?
- You bought her Cosmogirl.

716
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:25,378
The young girls enjoy the articles.

717
00:36:25,446 --> 00:36:28,903
You bought boy-band posters
and Hello Kitty notepads.

718
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:31,814
A lovely young girl at the store
helped me pick them out.

719
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:35,581
- You filled the room with sunflowers.
- Rory likes sunflowers.

720
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:40,447
- I know Rory likes sunflowers.
- What is the matter, Lorelai?

721
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:43,322
Nothing. I don't know.
It's just a little weird, that's all.

722
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:45,793
Why is it weird to do something
for my granddaughter?

723
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:48,854
I mean, it's not like you bought her a car.
By the way, don't.

724
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:50,864
It's a room, and...

725
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:53,422
You know, you're right.

726
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,969
It's nice. I'm sorry. I'm just being silly.

727
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:59,164
Maybe you don't like the fact
that she has a place away from you.

728
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,036
Someplace that's just her own.

729
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:02,266
I said I was fine.

730
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:06,300
Or because it's so large and spacious and
has four solid walls around the bathtub.

731
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:09,744
- Excuse me?
- It might not be exciting or bohemian...

732
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:13,510
but at least it doesn't have shovels
propped up against the sofa, does it?

733
00:37:13,584 --> 00:37:16,848
I'm sorry. I missed the checkered flag.
When did the argument start?

734
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,616
Is it because it's not a shack in the woods?
Or is it the proximity to me?

735
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:22,121
What are you talking about?

736
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:23,953
- You hated us that much?
- What?

737
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,788
You had to take that little girl away.
That was bad enough.

738
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:30,352
But to that?
To live there in a shed like a hobo?

739
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:32,159
Who uses the word 'hobo' anymore?

740
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:35,324
I saw that horrible little pit
you so proudly ran to.

741
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:37,368
I saw what you chose
over your own family.

742
00:37:37,436 --> 00:37:40,802
You'd have lived in the gutter,
in the street, in a cardboard box...

743
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:45,137
anywhere as long as you didn't
have to be near us. Isn't that true, Lorelai?

744
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:47,699
Mom, I was very young.

745
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:53,143
I was very unhappy. And I needed
to be someplace that wasn't here.

746
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:54,746
Excuse me.

747
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,318
- You're awfully quiet.
- I am?

748
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,916
- You hardly said anything at dinner.
- I was chewing.

749
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:12,621
- You didn't say anything on the ride home.
- I was concentrating.

750
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:16,962
I feel I've gotten sloppy with this whole
10 and 2 hand position thing.

751
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:20,294
Seriously. The other day,
I caught myself doing a 9 and 4.

752
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:23,201
If left uncorrected,
that can only lead to a 6 and 12.

753
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:24,703
Or, worse yet, an 8 and 11...

754
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:27,002
which is not only dangerous,
but uncomfortable.

755
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,506
Talk, please.

756
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:34,004
I just wish sometimes
that certain things could be different.

757
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,444
Like what?

758
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:39,648
Like, wouldn't it be great if once,
just once...

759
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:43,153
I could make my mother hear me?
I mean, really hear me...

760
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:46,519
- even if it was just for one second.
- Are you talking about the room?

761
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,081
The room, the potting shed,
my entire life after age six.

762
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,592
- It's my fault.
- How is it your fault?

763
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:56,562
I shouldn't have taken her there. I just
thought that if she saw how we lived...

764
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:59,030
and how pretty it was
with the lake and the swans...

765
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:00,793
That she'd do a happy dance?

766
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:03,062
That she'd feel included,
and then, maybe...

767
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:06,593
The whole 'me running away' thing
wouldn't be such a big deal?

768
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,576
Honey, me running away from them
is always gonna be a big deal.

769
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:15,509
There is nothing you can do
to change that.

770
00:39:17,547 --> 00:39:20,674
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes, I would date Steven Tyler.

771
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:23,216
Can I ask a question
whose answer wouldn't horrify me?

772
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:24,273
Go ahead.

773
00:39:24,353 --> 00:39:28,015
Do you think you and Grandma will talk
about the things you've gone through?

774
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:29,112
No.

775
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,920
- You didn't even consider it.
- Sorry. No.

776
00:39:32,993 --> 00:39:35,290
- Why?
- Because it would just end badly.

777
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:36,384
It doesn't have to.

778
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:39,055
It'd be like the first 15 minutes
of Saving Private Ryan.

779
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,619
At least they got to be in France.

780
00:39:40,698 --> 00:39:43,359
- You've never tried.
- No, that's not true. I have tried.

781
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:45,127
I have tried my whole life.

782
00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:48,637
But my mother and I,
we speak a different language.

783
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:51,636
I talk, I think I'm being clear,
and all she hears is:

784
00:39:51,707 --> 00:39:53,196
'Blah, blah, Ginger. '

785
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:57,972
But if you won't talk and she won't listen,
then how is anything ever gonna change?

786
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,168
I don't know.

787
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:05,543
Thanks. Don't tell me you're closed.

788
00:40:05,618 --> 00:40:07,812
- Would it change the outcome if I did?
- No.

789
00:40:07,886 --> 00:40:09,352
- Two coffees.
- Yes, please.

790
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:11,820
- Any pie to go with that?
- Pie!

791
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:13,355
We just had cake at Grandma's.

792
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:15,516
But that was crabby cake.
Let's have happy pie.

793
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:19,083
- Anything as long as there's coffee.
- I'll put on a fresh pot.

794
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:24,022
Hey, listen, I just want to say thanks.

795
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:25,394
For what?

796
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:28,767
For whatever it was
you said to Luke the other day.

797
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:30,358
It was no big deal.

798
00:40:30,437 --> 00:40:33,667
No, it was a very big deal.
I was sitting upstairs...

799
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:37,868
and suddenly he comes in, empties out
his sock drawer, and gives it to me.

800
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:40,968
That's great! You got a drawer!

801
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:43,878
- And a set of keys.
- You can put the keys in the drawer.

802
00:40:43,948 --> 00:40:45,642
He's accepting it.

803
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,218
He's believing it.
And it's all because of you.

804
00:40:49,285 --> 00:40:51,514
Actually, it's because of you.

805
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:55,317
- I'm not gonna screw it up this time.
- I know you won't.

806
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,050
I owe you one.

807
00:40:58,192 --> 00:41:01,183
So you're gonna be in Stars Hollow
for a while, then?

808
00:41:01,261 --> 00:41:04,024
- Yeah, quite a while.
- That's great.

809
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:09,264
- You want any ice cream with that pie?
- I did get you a drawer.

810
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,734
If I threw in hot fudge, you think you could
weasel me half the closet?

811
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,203
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

812
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,102
- Here.
- Thanks.

813
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:26,438
- Does it taste different to you?
- Yeah.

814
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:28,675
It does.

815
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:43,156
- So what do you think?
- It's got a great view.

816
00:41:43,227 --> 00:41:46,753
- And good highway access.
- I love that window back in the...

817
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:50,356
Library? No, lobby. No, bathroom?

818
00:41:50,432 --> 00:41:52,058
I'd get that decided before you open.

819
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,226
There's absolutely no kitchen space here!

820
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:57,964
How do we open a bed and breakfast
when there's no place to cook breakfast?

821
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:01,269
Then it's just a bed.
We'll have to charge half price.

822
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:03,137
We'll build a new kitchen, Sookie.

823
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:08,043
I'll need plenty of ventilation and an area
for an outdoor fireplace for barbeques.

824
00:42:08,113 --> 00:42:11,309
Plus storage.
Where did these people put anything?

825
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:14,445
A pantry and a canning room.

826
00:42:14,518 --> 00:42:17,111
- I'd love to smoke our own meats.
- Absolutely!

827
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:20,677
I don't know if this is gonna work.
I may have to do some floor plans.

828
00:42:20,757 --> 00:42:22,656
Where is that plumbing?

829
00:42:23,392 --> 00:42:25,916
- Your own inn.
- Cool.

830
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:28,586
- It's gonna be a really big job.
- Yeah.

831
00:42:28,663 --> 00:42:31,256
Maybe I'll get Rune
to manage the place for me.

832
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:34,595
- How's he doing?
- He put a tip jar on the reservation desk.

833
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:37,500
Michel tried to beat him senseless
with the reservation book.

834
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:39,559
- How did that go?
- Rune got away.

835
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:42,332
- Really?
- Michel can't run in new shoes.

836
00:42:44,074 --> 00:42:46,507
How long do you think
before you guys own this place?

837
00:42:46,576 --> 00:42:50,272
Sweetie, it's going to be a very long time.

838
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,714
- Do you think it'll still be here?
- Yeah.

839
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,316
I think we got a shot.
