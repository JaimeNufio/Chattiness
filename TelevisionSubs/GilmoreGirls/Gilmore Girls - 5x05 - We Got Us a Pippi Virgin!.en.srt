1
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:06,141
It's getting the word out to the business community that we're here - that's the key.

2
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:08,911
We've got to draw them in with the things that they like - amenities.

3
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:12,705
What does a businessman want when they travel? Booze, and hookers. Anything else?

4
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:15,193
- I think that covers it.
- We got booze. How do we get hookers?

5
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:18,252
How about a banner up front that reads "Hoes up at the Dragonfly"?

6
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:19,720
Or we tell them Bill Maher's here.

7
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,460
They'd come a-flocking.

8
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:25,310
Maybe we're in too silly a mood to be discussing such serious stuff.

9
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:26,150
You think?

10
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:30,390
Oh hey Jackson, what would you do to lure more businessmen to the Dragonfly?

11
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,941
Besides inviting Bill Maher.

12
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:34,014
What do I look like, the Shell Answer Man?

13
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,002
Everybody's gotta have a piece of Jackson. Well, he's got nothing left, I tell you, nothing.

14
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:40,317
His town selectman duties are starting to wear on him.

15
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:44,147
- That's why the fancy duds?
- He's got functions every day and meetings and hearings.

16
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:46,880
I tried to work in a nice suicide, but my schedule wouldn't allow it.

17
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,532
- Ugh, that sound's death to me.
- Don't answer it.

18
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,505
Could be a customer.

19
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:51,806
Hello?

20
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,051
Yes, Mrs. Cassini. I got the note about the playground equipment.

21
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:59,978
- Oh God, is that blood?
- It's tomato. It happens daily. Disrobe.

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,389
So you say your granddaughter fell off the ducky?

23
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:06,441
Oh, she fell off the piggy and she whacked her arm on the ducky.

24
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,517
Uh-huh. I see.

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,056
Well, the first thing I would do is question the horsy, 'cause he's right next to the piggy

26
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:13,930
and is our most reliable witness.

27
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:18,354
No, there's nothing funny about that, Mrs. Cassini. Nothing whatsoever.

28
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:19,685
Arms up, big boy.

29
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:26,495
No, a little girl being thrown from a pink, spring-loaded, bobbling piggy toy

30
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,504
is very serious business. Yes, Mrs. Cassini.

31
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:33,043
- I don't think that's gonna come out.
- Poor guy. He's only got two dress shirts.

32
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:34,921
Well, maybe a big old bloodstain will help him.

33
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:37,717
People will think there was an assassination attempt and be more sympathetic.

34
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:42,945
I do. I hear what you're saying, Mrs. Cassini. Yes, Mrs. Cassini.

35
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:48,092
I'll talk to my parks and recreation chairman and get this solved I promise.

36
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:50,856
- Goodbye, Mrs. Cassini.
- It's a goner.

37
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:54,173
- I know how it feels. I gotta go. I got a Kiwanis luncheon.
- Have fun.

38
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:57,696
- Jackson, before you go, I need your John Hancock on that there.
- Oh yeah?

39
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:00,569
Yeah, just right at the bottom. I was just ordering a ton of extra,

40
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:05,367
you know, vegetables and stuff. It's just to sign and confirm that I'm ordering that stuff.

41
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,462
Hey, this is for those extra parking spaces you need. It's selectman business.

42
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:11,818
- Really?
- Et tu, former friend?

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,818
- I just need your signature. It's your duty.
- So impeach me.

44
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:17,465
- I'll forge that for you.
- Thanks.

45
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:17,012
So Dickie high tails it to his office and e-mails me within seconds.

46
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:20,376
- Dickie's the other you at your office, right?
- Well, there's no other me.

47
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:23,636
- You know what I meant, Grandpa.
- Dickie and I share some duties.

48
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,565
We lunch occasionally, socialize a bit.

49
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:30,226
But he would cut my throat in a heartbeat, as I would his.

50
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:32,644
It's like Rikers Island, except everyone drives a Jag.

51
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:35,726
Well, Dickie made a mistake.

52
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:40,425
He e-mailed me, thinking that I wouldn't read it for days, but I read it the minute he sent it.

53
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:44,393
He figured my weekend starts at lunch on Fridays, as so many others do -

54
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,027
error followed by error.

55
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,110
That man needs to reread his Sun Tzu.

56
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,593
Anyway, that's why I am missing Friday Night dinner.

57
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,327
Dickie and I are going to be in the Chicago office.

58
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,992
- Well, send me a postcard.
- I'm traveling much less, but I don't miss it.

59
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,192
Thirty years ago, any chance I had to travel, I jumped at, but now...

60
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:05,596
I'm talking a lot, aren't I?

61
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,513
No. I mean, yes. But it's good.

62
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,275
- I don't want to be tiresome.
- Grandpa, you could never tire me. This is fun.

63
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:17,699
Good. My valet isn't much of a conversationalist. He's the master of the monosyllable,

64
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,640
although he can shine a shoe with the best of them. So, been reading anything good lately?

65
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:24,811
I'm very into P.G. Wodehouse right now.

66
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:25,987
- Oh, that's great.
- You?

67
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:29,876
- Actually, I've had a personal triumph of late.
- Oh, yeah? What?

68
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:34,124
I've just finished the sixth and final volume of "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. "

69
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:38,060
- That is a triumph.
- I started it in 1968.

70
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:42,844
So it took only - what? - 36 years to finish it. But by God, I finished it.

71
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:45,143
Wow. That's quite a commitment.

72
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,744
Well, I've had a little more time on my hands lately.

73
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:50,375
Not as many evenings out as there once were.

74
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,020
Right. Not as many.

75
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:54,159
You're still getting together with your grandmother tonight, aren't you?

76
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,625
- Has she mentioned her car lately?
- Her car?

77
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:00,350
It's due for its six-month service. I hope she isn't skipping those.

78
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:02,265
I don't know. I'm happy to ask.

79
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:05,551
Oh, no. That's too much trouble. I'll have Robert check with her maid.

80
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:06,387
Okay.

81
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:09,863
He may have to use upwards of six syllables for this one. I wish him luck.

82
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:13,293
Couldn't you just ask her yourself, Grandpa? I mean, you're right there.

83
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:15,526
- No, I don't want to be an annoyance.
- Okay.

84
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:19,346
- But, Grandpa -
- Chicken's getting cold.

85
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:20,195
Right.

86
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:25,284
I saw the most preposterous thing on TV the other night.

87
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:27,845
It's been ages since I've just flipped through the channels,

88
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:30,815
and the horrors to be discovered there.

89
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:35,002
Hey, what brings you here?

90
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,758
Caffeine withdrawal. And I like looking at you.

91
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:37,855
- To go?
- To go.

92
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,437
Don't worry about it.

93
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,282
Luke, this is your business. I've always paid, and I always should pay.

94
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,609
Fine, but don't tip me. Tipping now is weird.

95
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,295
Okay. Besides, I can tip you later.

96
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:49,790
- That was weird, too.
- I'm a very awkward winker.

97
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,418
- You're never supposed to tip me, anyway.
- What?

98
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:54,325
I'm the proprietor. You're not supposed to tip the proprietor, even when they serve you.

99
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:57,333
You mean all those years, that extra 20% was unnecessary?

100
00:06:57,663 --> 00:07:00,506
- You never tipped me 20%.
- Ooh. Now it's getting ugly.

101
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:03,853
You were a solid 15 percenter, sometimes less if the bill got higher.

102
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,477
Way less if you were mad at me about something.

103
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:08,200
Well, it doesn't matter. I wasn't supposed to be tipping you, anyway.

104
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,957
- True.
- In fact, I want a rebate.

105
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,847
- What?
- You've been ripping me off for ten years.

106
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:14,237
- Have your lawyer call my lawyer.
- Thank you

107
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:16,075
- We still on for tomorrow night?
- Absolutely.

108
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:17,426
- Talk to you later.
- Bye.

109
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:22,736
Oh hi, Lorelai.

110
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:25,650
Hi, Dean. Um, good to bump into you.

111
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:28,624
Yeah, same here. Um, you on your way back to work?

112
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:30,478
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah. I'm going to Doose's.

113
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,157
You were just at the inn.

114
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:35,658
Yeah, Tom wanted me to sand some doors down. They were getting a little warped.

115
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:38,746
I saw you in the hallway there, but you looked kind of busy.

116
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:40,278
Yeah, I saw you, too.

117
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:44,451
- So, how's our girl?
- Rory?

118
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:45,255
Yeah.

119
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,533
Uh, she's good. I saw her like three days ago, or a couple days ago. But yeah, she's good.

120
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:53,473
Good. Well, I talked to her this morning, so I win.

121
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,298
- Not that it's a contest.
- Right.

122
00:07:56,857 --> 00:08:00,957
Well, I guess I'll see you around. Next time you're at the inn, find me.

123
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:02,606
We could have some coffee and chew the fat.

124
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:05,034
Sounds like a disgusting combination, but anyway come by.

125
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:07,029
- I will. Sure. Absolutely.
- Okay.

126
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,570
- So have a good day.
- You too.

127
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:14,786
I'll get it, Sara.

128
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,427
- Hi, Mom.
- Come in, come in.

129
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,107
I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic was bad.

130
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:23,553
Some moron coming out of Stars Hollow decided to go the speed limit, which is - ooh!

131
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:26,005
What the hell is that?

132
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:27,408
What does it look like? It's a panic room.

133
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:30,313
- Like Jodie Foster?
- I have no idea.

134
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,586
But it's very small. It's more like an anxiety room.

135
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:33,891
It's for one person.

136
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:35,479
You could maybe squeeze two in.

137
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,206
And when those two are done panicking, the next couple of panickers get a turn?

138
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:40,966
- It's primarily for me.
- Why the foyer?

139
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:43,798
It was supposed to go upstairs, but the boors who delivered it

140
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:46,911
claimed they weren't told about the stairs, so they didn't have the right equipment.

141
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,891
Hey, let's test it out. I'm gonna get you.

142
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:50,925
Oh, my God.

143
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:53,558
You better get in there, 'cause I'm a bad guy. Baah!

144
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,910
- Stop it.
- I'm menacing. Panic, damn it. Come on.

145
00:08:56,982 --> 00:08:58,477
There's nothing funny about this.

146
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:00,950
- Oh! Get in, quick! Quick!
- Stop it.

147
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:05,408
Hi, Grandma.

148
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:07,683
So - hey, what's that?

149
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:11,697
I know how to protect you from shrapnel and Agent Orange. Ask me how.

150
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,883
- It's a panic room.
- Like Jodie Foster?

151
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:15,660
What does Jodie Foster have to do with this?

152
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:16,735
You need one for your dorm.

153
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,843
That's not a stupid thought. It'll stop a 9-millimeter shell.

154
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:22,306
- Handy for when Suge Knight comes for tea.
- Why is it here?

155
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,716
It's a long story. Come, let's have drinks and forget about the panic room.

156
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,380
- What'll you have?
- Gin martini.

157
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:30,820
- A soda with lime.
- This little rinky-dink cart has nothing.

158
00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:31,920
Dad got the big one?

159
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:34,646
He stole it away in the dark of night, so I'm stranded.

160
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:38,474
I had our minister over a couple of days ago, and he had to go without his whiskey sour.

161
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,308
I bet he excommunicated you on the spot.

162
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:43,011
I've got vermouth, but no gin. Perfect. Sara?

163
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:47,456
- Yes, ma'am?
- I need gin. Check everywhere.

164
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,755
- Including the bathtub.
- Start with the pantry.

165
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:50,660
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:55,022
You know, the main reason I got the panic room is because I'm a woman living alone.

167
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:58,203
Well, let the record show I did not bring up the panic room.

168
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:00,215
Do you know I've never lived alone?

169
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,754
I went from my parents' house to college to Richard.

170
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:05,975
But, Grandma, you're not alone alone. Grandpa is only a few feet away.

171
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,085
He might as well be a million miles away.

172
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:12,236
I don't even know if your grandfather would look up from his stamp collection if he heard me scream.

173
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,209
That's not true.

174
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,900
Unless his nose got stuck to the stamp in the book and he physically couldn't look up.

175
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,058
It happens.

176
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:21,386
He's gone so much, he's no protection, anyway. He just left on some business trip,

177
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:24,217
and it's an afterthought that he even bothered to tell me about it at all.

178
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:27,990
But he told you, so that's not an afterthought. That's a thought - a very thoughtful thought.

179
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,264
I'm sure it was in some way for his own convenience.

180
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,466
There's no gin anywhere, Mrs. Gilmore.

181
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,502
- Oh, perfect.
- I'll check the bathtub now.

182
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:35,968
That was a joke, Sara.

183
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:38,507
Lorelai, please don't joke with the maids. It's not what they do.

184
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,103
Sorry.

185
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,062
- Check Mr. Gilmore's study.
- Yes, ma'am.

186
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:44,486
I should just call Richard myself and drag him away from whatever business meal

187
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,829
he is having and make him tell me.

188
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:48,169
It's okay. Mom doesn't need a martini. Right?

189
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:51,865
Yeah. Right. I'll take what you got. What's good enough for the minister is good enough for me.

190
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,513
- Your hands are empty.
- The door to the study is locked.

191
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,037
He locked the study?

192
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,613
Mom, really, I don't need gin. I'll take whatever you have.

193
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,835
I don't have anything. That's the problem. Come on.

194
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:01,846
Come on where?

195
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:05,490
I'm not going to let Richard's business trip keep you from having the drink you want.

196
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,529
Grandma, wait.

197
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,576
Should we really be doing this?

198
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:15,382
Oh, that he can live in this squalor.

199
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,307
It's another Calcutta. Is that open sewage?

200
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:19,236
It certainly smells like a sewer in here.

201
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:20,834
It's his cigars. That's the smell.

202
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:23,227
It's more than cigars. It's debauchery.

203
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,868
Yeah. Dad mentioned he had the Barbi twins up here a couple nights ago.

204
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:28,376
He and his butler have a little "auto focus" thing going on.

205
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,183
Well, the drink cart's over there, Grandma. We can grab the gin and vamoose.

206
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:34,321
No, she's got vamoose, remember? It's the gin we need. - But you know -

207
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:36,743
He must have five packs of breath mints here.

208
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:38,877
Why would a man need five packs of breath mints?

209
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,858
It could be the gorgonzola and onion diet he's on. It has its drawbacks.

210
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,680
Grandma, I feel kind of weird snooping like this.

211
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:50,220
This is my property as much as his, and when we die, it'll be yours. We're all entitled here.

212
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:51,785
He's got some new books.

213
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:55,078
Hey, my Petunia Pig plate and spoon. What's it doing here?

214
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:57,663
Oh, odds and ends wound up out here over the years.

215
00:11:57,772 --> 00:12:00,220
This is not an odd nor an end. It's my Petunia Pig and I'm taking it.

216
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:01,259
It's not yours to take.

217
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,207
- Dad's not using my Petunia Pig spoon.
- I say take it.

218
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:08,410
Hey, Mom, what are we carrying our booty home in? Do you have a canvas bag with a big dollar sign on it?

219
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay. Just to remind you once again, the drink cart is right over here.

220
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:14,094
Oh, and I think I spot gin. It's brown, right?

221
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:16,310
I love that you think that. Looking for skeletons?

222
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:17,386
I'm just looking.

223
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:21,974
Oh, man. I spilled a ton of scotch on my skirt. Who's not closing these bottles?

224
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:24,165
- Oh, my God.
- Did you really find a skeleton?

225
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:28,015
Okay, Gin - it's clear, it's in my hand, and it looks good enough for a minister. Let's go.

226
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:31,129
Oh, my God. Will you look at this?

227
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,301
- Bright.
- And tasteful.

228
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:34,590
- It's a vest.
- Grandpa has lots of vests.

229
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:37,124
- It's got glitter. It's a glitter vest.
- So?

230
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:40,109
So? Where would your father wear a vest like this?

231
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:41,895
Certainly nowhere he ever would've taken me.

232
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,017
Grandma, it's just a vest.

233
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:45,465
Yeah Mom. There's tons of places he would wear that.

234
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:47,134
- Name one.
- Okay, I'm at a loss.

235
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:48,180
This is insane.

236
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:50,888
Mom, this is the place where unwanted things came to repose.

237
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:52,755
Maybe it's a vest of his from the old days.

238
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:57,129
Our days never included Richard dressing up like that gay fellow whose tiger tried to eat him.

239
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,198
I have definitely, positively never seen this vest. This is a party vest.

240
00:13:01,286 --> 00:13:02,867
Okay, just put it back, Mom, and let's go.

241
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:03,677
You put it back.

242
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,688
You know, we've moved a lot of stuff around here tonight. We've got to cover our tracks.

243
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:09,815
- Where did you find it?
- Squished in the middle, as if he was hiding it from me.

244
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,964
- Can you blame him? It's hideous.
- How dare he have a vest like that.

245
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:14,829
Okay, the mints looked something like this, right?

246
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:17,547
- That devious man.
- Come on, Mom, let's go.

247
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:20,600
- Mom, Petunia Pig.
- Grab it.

248
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:36,752
I have never seen Grandma so singularly obsessed about a piece of clothing.

249
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,995
Not since I wore my "Gas, Grass, or Ass -

250
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,632
No one rides for free" t-shirt to the junior league spring tea.

251
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:45,821
Here we go. Boysenberry pie with ice cream. Hot fudge sundae. Half a grapefruit.

252
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:47,412
- I don't want a grapefruit.
- It's good for you.

253
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:50,208
- Kinda my point.
- It's too late for her, but not for you. Eat it.

254
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,358
The service is very rude. No tip for you.

255
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,958
In fact, he actually owes us a lot of money because we weren't supposed to be tipping him all these years.

256
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,695
I know. Customarily, you do not have to tip the proprietor of an establishment.

257
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:01,181
Why have we been tipping him all these years?

258
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:02,476
- We like him?
- Oh, that.

259
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:06,412
Hey, bring us some coffee, and I promise this grapefruit will be eaten.

260
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:07,611
Okay.

261
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,520
- How long is my nose?
- Very.

262
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:10,540
What's with the scarfing?

263
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:15,799
Well, I figured since it's still early I'd stop by Dean's new place real quick and say hi. Is that okay?

264
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,759
Oh, yeah. So he's out of the parents'?

265
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:20,719
Yeah. He's sleeping on his friend Kyle's couch. It's just temporary.

266
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:24,298
Great. You know, we could call him and have him meet us here if you want.

267
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,291
- Really?
- Yeah.

268
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,424
Plenty of pie, ice cream, grapefruit to go around.

269
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,609
If we twist his arm, I bet Luke will throw in some raw spinach.

270
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:33,052
I don't think it's a good idea.

271
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,317
So skip the spinach.

272
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,278
- You know what I mean.
- No. What?

273
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,050
It's been a little weird between you two.

274
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:39,429
- No, it hasn't.
- Mom.

275
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:41,680
I just ran into him today. Didn't he tell you?

276
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:43,452
Yeah. He said it was weird.

277
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:46,353
Well, then it was only weird on his side, 'cause it wasn't on mine.

278
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:51,588
Hey, how about I come along with you to Kyle's? He's back from the Navy, right?

279
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,580
We could all hang out and hear his stories. He could teach us some sea chanteys,

280
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:59,603
and I could tell Dean how not weird the situation is. See? That's how unweird it is for me.

281
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:01,582
- I'd do that.
- No. That'd be weird, too.

282
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,855
- I don't like it this way.
- I know.

283
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,872
We all used to get together all the time for whatever and hang out.

284
00:15:09,271 --> 00:15:12,009
We had a great rhythm. I like Dean. I've always liked Dean.

285
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,735
He has a great heart. I don't want it to be weird.

286
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:16,547
Neither do I. Dean doesn't either.

287
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:21,895
Well, then, what about tomorrow night? Let's all hook up then.

288
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:25,503
- All who?
- All of us. You know - the gang - the fearsome foursome.

289
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,043
- How does that sound?
- How does what sound?

290
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,568
- Doing something with Rory tomorrow night.
- You don't have to.

291
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:32,240
No, no really. That sounds great. We can all do something together.

292
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:36,822
Yeah. It's a great idea. There's a ground swell of support. Let's do it.

293
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,308
- Okay, if you want.
- Yeah, we want, right?

294
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,797
- Yeah. We want.
- Good. Go run it past Dean.

295
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,266
- Dean?
- I'm sure I can persuade him.

296
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:43,802
- Good.
- Yeah, good.

297
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,367
- I'll see you tomorrow night.
- Okay. See you tomorrow night.

298
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:47,026
Bye, Luke.

299
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,824
- Dean? Rory's seeing Dean?
- Yeah, you knew that.

300
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:53,519
No, I didn't.

301
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:56,038
- Wha - Didn't I tell you?
- No. Since when?

302
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:57,861
- Since she got back from Europe.
- I don't believe it.

303
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:00,365
- Haven't you seen them walking around?
- No. Were you hiding it?

304
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:04,261
No. I just - I wasn't sure when they wanted people to know

305
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:07,123
or how I should tell people without getting hammered with a bunch of questions.

306
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:10,937
Was this before he left his wife or after? Did - did he leave her for Rory?

307
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,960
Like those. Questions just like those.

308
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:15,397
Sorry, it's just, you know, Dean and Rory together again.

309
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:18,694
Well, you can back out if you want. I kind of Shanghaied you there.

310
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:22,039
No. We can do it. I just have to wrap my mind around it. Dean.

311
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,949
- Dean.
- Dean.

312
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,395
All right. Well, I'll be right back.

313
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:32,291
"G."

314
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:33,742
"G."

315
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:36,163
For four beats, back to "C" major then jump to "A" minor.

316
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:37,731
"C" minor to "A."

317
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:39,150
- Major.
- "A" major.

318
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:41,059
"A" minor after "C" major, then it's back to "G."

319
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:44,448
Yo, Kid Flash, slow down. I've got chops, but I'm not Les Paul.

320
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:46,518
Follow the chart, Zach. You wrote it all down.

321
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:48,309
I can't look at the chart. It's depressing.

322
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:49,892
How can a chord chart be depressing?

323
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,603
The title, "Brian's Song. "

324
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:52,795
It's a working title.

325
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:56,562
Well, it's bumming me out. It's reminding me of Billy Dee Williams and cancer. Change it.

326
00:16:56,644 --> 00:16:58,277
I have to change a working title? Come on.

327
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:01,027
Well, then leave it if you don't mind bumming every body out.

328
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:04,089
Or change it to "Lepers Are Fun" or "Kiss My Scurvy. "

329
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:07,121
Look. There. "Brian's Tune," okay? Good working title there.

330
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:11,415
- Okay. From the "G," we go to -
- Let's take five. I gotta clear my head.

331
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:12,518
Okay. Five minutes.

332
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,742
I'm gonna go water the lawn. We're getting brown spots again.

333
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,180
Don't over water. That's not good for it, either.

334
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:27,465
So, how you doing, Zach?

335
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:28,737
Comme ci, comme ca.

336
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:30,232
Anything new?

337
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:32,812
Went to the dentist. Said I'm brushing too vigorously.

338
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:35,583
Oh interesting. 'Cause when you're a kid, they tell you to really go at it, ya know?

339
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:37,503
Another lie fed to our generation.

340
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:38,281
Yeah.

341
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:40,846
And now I'm paying with eroding gums. Want to see 'em?

342
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:41,788
I'm good.

343
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,350
So, anything else on your mind?

344
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,602
Not really.

345
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,060
Want a drink or anything?

346
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,614
Nope. I want for nothing.

347
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,490
- Hi, Kyle.
- Oh, hey, Rory. Come on in.

348
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,737
- Thanks.
- Welcome to Casa Kyle.

349
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,304
It's not the Taj Mahal, but it's cozy.

350
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:11,546
- You like Dylan?
- I think I better.

351
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:15,089
Yeah. I listened to a lot of Dylan out at sea. He really spoke to me.

352
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,173
- And you understood him?
- Funny.

353
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,909
So you look good. How you been doing?

354
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,863
Great. Navy's been fantastic.

355
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:26,098
Bitchin' rehab, so I'm up and running. I can drive, type 60 words a minute.

356
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,925
- You know what else?
- No. What?

357
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,544
This thing is a real chick magnet. Yeah. It's the Captain Hook thing.

358
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:32,578
Well, good for you.

359
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,616
- Hey. What are you doing here?
- Bonus visit.

360
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:39,547
Oh. I think I know what that means. I'm gonna make myself scarce.

361
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,652
No, Kyle. It's okay. We don't want to put you out.

362
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:45,201
Don't worry, I gotta make some calls. Check my traps, if you know what I mean.

363
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:49,266
Give a shout out to Cindy or Luene or maybe throw Stacy a little something.

364
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,093
He's been throwing it around a lot lately.

365
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:53,152
Everybody loves the Bionic Man.

366
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,827
That's not me. Mine plays "Superfreak. "

367
00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:57,714
Sorry. It's me.

368
00:18:58,723 --> 00:18:59,998
I'll leave you two to play.

369
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:02,183
Hello?

370
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:05,572
Rory, listen, I like you, and I want to be more than just friends with you.

371
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,929
- What!?
- See? You reacted.

372
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:11,941
That's what a person does after someone says that they like him or her, but in my case, it's him.

373
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,614
- Oh, we're talking Zach here.
- The inscrutable Zach.

374
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:18,516
He's driving me crazy. I gave him ample opportunity to address the issue,

375
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:21,404
- and all he talked about was his eroding gums.
- Oh, sexy.

376
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:24,595
He's really getting on my nerves, that guy. Where are you, school?

377
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,558
No, I'm with Dean. He's staying with Kyle.

378
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,919
- Oh, how's his hook?
- Apparently it's a chick magnet.

379
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,999
Well, say hi to Dean.

380
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:33,200
- Hi from Lane.
- Hi, Lane!

381
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:36,554
- And call me back when you're less distracted.
- I will. Keep me posted.

382
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:38,208
If there's anything to post.

383
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:39,447
- Bye.
- Bye.

384
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:44,536
- So, tomorrow night.
- Yeah. What time?

385
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:48,136
Well, I can get here pretty early, but I just wanted to talk about plans with you.

386
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:49,442
Sure. What do you want to do?

387
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:52,563
How about we go on a double date with my mom and Luke?

388
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,838
- A double date?
- Yeah.

389
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,241
Won't that be awkward, weird, and about 50 other things like that?

390
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:02,441
Mom and I already talked about the weird issue in detail, and it won't be.

391
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:04,141
- It was Mom's idea.
- You're kidding.

392
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:07,684
No. You're forgetting, we used to hang out all the time. We had fun.

393
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,579
That was a long time ago.

394
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:12,901
Yeah, but we had fun.

395
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,159
I remember.

396
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:17,452
Well, so does Mom. Come on.

397
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:20,924
Okay.

398
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,609
Good. I'm off.

399
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,142
I hate these short visits.

400
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:28,440
- They're better than none, though.
- I guess.

401
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:31,072
Don't leave on my account, 'cause I'm outta here.

402
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:34,768
A couple of my girls took the bait. I'm thinking about doing a back-to-backer.

403
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:36,971
Well, I'm not leaving on your account. Tomorrow?

404
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:37,682
Tomorrow.

405
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:41,731
No rest for Kyle.

406
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:45,608
Yeah? Hey, cool.

407
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,717
Yeah, what are you doing around 11:30, baby?

408
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:49,464
All right.

409
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,895
- So is meeting up at 6:30 cool?
- Good with us. What'd you have in mind?

410
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,643
I'll surprise you with it, but it's a classic Stars Hollow slate of activities.

411
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:02,657
- So we're gonna T.P. Taylor's house again?
- Ugh. I wanted it to be a surprise.

412
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:04,967
- Wait, hon. Hold on a sec.
- Okay.

413
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,564
Hello?

414
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:08,357
- Lorelai, are you alone?
- Why?

415
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,278
Because I'm going to give you the code to open the panic room from the outside

416
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:13,790
and I don't want to do it if you're not alone.

417
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,476
Just hanging out here with my close friend Tex Watson.

418
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:19,517
This is not a joking matter. Can I trust you with this information?

419
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:22,140
Maybe not. Maybe you should give it to someone else, someone closer.

420
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:24,925
- Well, I can't trust a neighbor.
- How about Dad?

421
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:27,925
Oh, your father wouldn't come to my rescue if I was on fire.

422
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:31,530
Besides, that vest of his is so loud he wouldn't be able to hear me screaming.

423
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:35,390
Okay, Mom. Give me the code, and I will keep the code safe.

424
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:37,475
Okay. Here goes. Are you ready?

425
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:38,518
Pen is poised.

426
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:43,542
1, 1, 1... 1, 1.

427
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:45,994
Is that the code it came with?

428
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:48,805
Well, I don't know how to change it. The men were supposed to show me,

429
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:51,645
and now it's the code I'm stuck with. Did you write it down?

430
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:53,915
Barring an aneurysm, I think I'll remember it.

431
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:57,084
Well, factor in an aneurysm and write it down. This is important.

432
00:21:57,144 --> 00:22:00,094
Okay. I'm writing it down. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

433
00:22:00,156 --> 00:22:01,375
Don't say it out loud.

434
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,768
Our football team is so great. We won, won, won, won, won.

435
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,811
- Everything's a joke.
- No, Mom, seriously.

436
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:09,997
The mailman overheard. I gotta get off the phone and chase him down and whack him.

437
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:11,368
- Hide that number.
- I will.

438
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:12,551
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

439
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:18,392
I'm back. That was mom giving me the secret panic room code.

440
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:20,014
She should just give it to Grandpa.

441
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:24,052
I suggested that, but she scoffed. Those two should just divorce and get it over with.

442
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:25,921
- Don't say that.
- I was just talking.

443
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:27,076
It's not funny.

444
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:29,268
But this standoff between them isn't good for anybody.

445
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:33,558
Mom's getting more insane and sharing the insanity with me and everybody else.

446
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:37,711
Divorce is not the answer. I can tell you for a fact that Grandpa is miserable.

447
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:41,443
Really? He and Jeeves seem very happy in their new modern relationship.

448
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,189
Grandpa misses Grandma terribly.

449
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:44,722
Why? He say something like that?

450
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,200
- I just know.
- How?

451
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:49,549
Yesterday, when we had lunch on campus, Grandpa told me

452
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,003
that he finished "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. " Hmm? You see?

453
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,550
You want to de-Mensa the reference?

454
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:59,333
No one sits at home alone reading that book unless it's a class assignment.

455
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,836
It just doesn't happen. It's a honking long book. It's clearly a cry for help.

456
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,607
You're very anti-intellectual.

457
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:07,935
He asked me if Grandma had taken her car in for its six-month service.

458
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:10,413
Hon, that's concern for her car, not for her.

459
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,846
No, that's concern about Grandma and her safety.

460
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:15,682
Why didn't you mention this to Mom at dinner? Maybe she would have been less panicked

461
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,658
about what he's doing and the now-infamous glitter vest.

462
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:20,279
I don't want to open a can of worms.

463
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:21,796
How would that open up a can of worms?

464
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:24,340
If I told her what I said, I'd have to tell her I had lunch with him,

465
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:28,691
a lunch I had previously not informed her of and that would have made her jealous and defensive.

466
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:30,279
The less you tell Grandma, the better.

467
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,355
- By George, I think she's got it.
- What?

468
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:37,431
I have been trying to burn that into your brain since you were a baby, but you stubbornly resisted.

469
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:38,809
Now a breakthrough. I'm so proud.

470
00:23:38,907 --> 00:23:41,779
- So 6:30, you said?
- By the gazebo. Dress is cas.

471
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:44,959
I really, really, really hate what's going on with Grandma and Grandpa.

472
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:47,862
I know, hon, but it's up to them to fix it.

473
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:48,787
I guess.

474
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,287
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

475
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:53,197
See you tonight. Bye-bye.

476
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,645
Lorelai? This is a surprise. Did we have an appointment?

477
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,650
Oh, no, I just stopped by to pick something up for Mom and apparently she's not home.

478
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:11,577
She's at a D.A.R. Meeting. She's always there mid-Saturday afternoons. You should know that.

479
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:13,353
Oh, yeah. I guess I forgot.

480
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:18,259
Maybe one day the entire D.A.R. will go collectively wiggy and meet on a late Saturday afternoon.

481
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:20,425
I doubt that. Can I get you something? Water, soda?

482
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:23,400
No, no, thanks. I'm fine. See you have your nose in your Proust.

483
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:26,435
- Yes, have you read him?
- Oh, I tried once. Struck out.

484
00:24:27,106 --> 00:24:28,766
Whoa. That's a lot of Certs.

485
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:31,909
You know how that is - you pick one up, you forget you have it.

486
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:34,157
You pick up another. The cycle continues.

487
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,933
- Kind of like me and men.
- What?

488
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,335
I don't know. Mom wasn't here, so there was a vacuum.

489
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:40,849
Ah. I'm sorry about the mess.

490
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:45,042
My man is with his sick mother, and I'm kind of left in the lurch here.

491
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,264
Ah, your Lurch left you in the lurch.

492
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:50,148
Hey, is that where that's from? You know, Lurch on the "Addams Family"?

493
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:54,264
- 'Cause he would leave people in the lurch?
- I'm not familiar with the etymology of Lurch.

494
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,554
So Lurch is away, you're back from your trip. Anything else new with you?

495
00:24:58,723 --> 00:24:59,718
Not that I can think of.

496
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:03,756
How have you been spending your time lately? Anything new and fancy?

497
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:04,673
Not really.

498
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:06,782
I joined a barbershop quartet.

499
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:10,428
- What do you mean, "aha"?
- And what does the barbershop quartet entail?

500
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,284
It's a musical group. We dress up in outfits.

501
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,971
- Stop saying that.
- What kind of outfits?

502
00:25:17,077 --> 00:25:21,246
- Well, old-timey period things.
- Straw hats, vests?

503
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:24,427
That kind of thing. And don't say "aha" again. It's loud.

504
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,996
Dad, have you talked to Mom lately?

505
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:28,624
Your mother has nothing to say to me.

506
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:32,843
That's not true. I'm sure she'd be interested in what you're doing, like the quartet thing.

507
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:33,524
Why?

508
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,356
Why? You were together 40 years.

509
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,205
She couldn't care less about what I do.

510
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:42,879
Dad, you're still her husband. And if you're filling your nights with something,

511
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,085
I'm sure she'd be curious what you're filling them with, as you would be with her.

512
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:49,489
Just think about it, okay?

513
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:52,186
I'll tell Robert to tell your mother you were here when he gets back.

514
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,354
Bye.

515
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:02,617
When did the bathroom sink stop up?

516
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:04,660
It just happened. I called the landlord. He's on it.

517
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:06,492
'Cause we've got rights you know. This isn't Russia.

518
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,726
- Can I scoot in here?
- Sure.

519
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,911
Don't brush too hard, dude. I'd show you my gums, but you'd puke.

520
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:14,393
- What about flossing?
- You mean the silent killer? It's a rope of destruction.

521
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,988
- Nothing's safe anymore.
- Gentle little strokes.

522
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:20,967
We still lack basic necessities, man. We've gotta get a plunger.

523
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:21,750
Yeah.

524
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:22,877
Wanna go today?

525
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:26,011
To get a plunger? I know a store that sells 'em used.

526
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:27,255
Zach?

527
00:26:27,515 --> 00:26:29,266
- Yeah?
- I've changed my mind.

528
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:32,421
- I've changed my mind. I'm taking it back.
- Taking what back?

529
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:35,399
I have no feelings for you. I was confused before, that's all, but not anymore.

530
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:38,242
We're roommates and bandmates, and that's it, and that's all it'll ever be.

531
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:50,177
- Is that them?
- Yeah, that's Stretch and Skinny.

532
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,511
- Oh, man, he's wearing nice slacks.
- I don't think so.

533
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,086
- They're creased.
- That equals nice?

534
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:58,702
I hate that. It's hard enough getting dressed for a date.

535
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:01,293
When you're gonna double with people, it's like dressing for four.

536
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,756
Well, at least be thankful you're not wearing your penguin outfit.

537
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:06,684
- Then you really would have been out of place.
- This is so not a slacks evening.

538
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,388
- Please stop saying slacks. That word is creepy.
- Sorry.

539
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:11,549
And don't mention the "S" word to them, okay?

540
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:13,801
Dean is going to be uncomfortable enough as it is.

541
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:18,025
We don't want him to think that we're judging him, or that you're inordinately interested in his pants.

542
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:19,940
- Hi, hi.
- Hi.

543
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:23,837
- Dean. Hi. Hi.
- Oh, hi.

544
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,422
- Wow, this is going to be fun.
- Yeah, absolutely.

545
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:28,460
- How you doing, buddy?
- Yeah, good. How you doing?

546
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,787
Too bad you weren't holding a trophy. That would have made a great picture.

547
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,078
So what's on the agenda?

548
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,566
We grab some takeout then hit the "Black, White, and Read" movie theater.

549
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:37,793
- Cool.
- I miss that place. It's been forever.

550
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,959
They're playing a great movie tonight. "Cool Hand Luke. "

551
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,114
- Not too shabby.
- Let's go get the food.

552
00:27:42,324 --> 00:27:45,576
- Well, good timing. No line at Jojo's.
- Let's just get the stuff at my place.

553
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:46,221
Why?

554
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,766
- Same kind of food, but better.
- Yours is way better.

555
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:51,009
- That's why we're going to Jojo's.
- What?

556
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,136
- Allow me.
- Take it.

557
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:54,274
We always do Jojo's on B.W.R. Nights.

558
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:56,799
That's short for "Black, White, and Read" movie theater. That's our little nickname.

559
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,766
I'm following it.

560
00:27:57,849 --> 00:27:59,871
Because your stuff is good and has to be eaten pretty quickly.

561
00:27:59,953 --> 00:28:02,804
- If it sits around, it starts to suck.
- That's true of all food.

562
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:07,377
Ah, but not Jojo's. Jojo's sucks to begin with, so it's no worse when you eat it later.

563
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:10,214
It's a relativity thing. Einstein and whatnot.

564
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:14,152
The secret is Jojo's chili. The chili acts as a seal.

565
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:16,870
Jojo's burgers could travel to China, and they'd still be just as good.

566
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,580
- Because they start off bad.
- Get it?

567
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,931
- Not really.
- Good, then let's go.

568
00:28:20,192 --> 00:28:22,399
- Plus, Jojo's is cheaper.
- 'Cause it sucks.

569
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:25,727
- I'm just saying.
- Jojo is going to be so excited to be making a sale.

570
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:29,169
- Hello?
- Are they open?

571
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:31,242
- The sign said they were.
- Hello?

572
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,261
I have a gun!

573
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:33,857
Chill out, Kirk. We're here for the movie.

574
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:35,896
- You were supposed to pay out front.
- You weren't out front.

575
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:37,729
- Here's $20.
- That's too much.

576
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:40,765
- Keep the change.
- You can get in 16 more people for that.

577
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:41,836
Put it towards the popcorn.

578
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,133
- Let's sit.
- Yes, yes. Ooh, let's take Big Red.

579
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,572
Yes, Big Red.

580
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:49,531
- That's the name for the couch.
- Yes, thanks. I kind of caught onto that.

581
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:51,420
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no, no you go.

582
00:28:51,507 --> 00:28:54,123
- That's okay.
- No, that's fine. It's the same down here.

583
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,553
Cool, we have a short feature to start. "The Katzenjammer kids try to sit on the couch. "

584
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,066
Whoa, I love the emptiness.

585
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:02,526
Ah, means we can talk during the movie.

586
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,327
Would people being here have stopped you?

587
00:29:04,404 --> 00:29:06,104
We would have hesitated ever so slightly.

588
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,743
Food, food!

589
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:13,886
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the "Black, White, and Read Theater".

590
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:17,005
- How are we all doing tonight?
- Good, Kirk. How are you?

591
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:18,566
Good, I'm Kirk.

592
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:24,121
I'm very proud to announce that tonight's feature presentation is the classic "Cool Hand Luke. "

593
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:32,001
But I'm deeply sorry to report that the first reel of the movie inexplicably caught fire earlier this evening.

594
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:32,816
Oh, no!

595
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,146
That's what happens when Richard Pryor is your projectionist.

596
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:39,247
I can still show you the film, but you'd miss the first 25 minutes.

597
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:42,908
I'd be happy to recap what you'd miss, or even act it out for you.

598
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:45,350
- I must say, I do a wicked George Kennedy.
- What do you think?

599
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:48,032
- First 25 minutes are pretty important.
- I agree.

600
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,669
But having Kirk reenact things can be pretty disturbing.

601
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,580
He totally ruined "Last Tango in Paris" for me.

602
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:54,658
What are our options in place of "Cool Hand," Kirk?

603
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:57,295
I can offer you anything from the theater's library of films.

604
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:58,021
What have you got?

605
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:03,050
A series of graphically violent driver's education films or "The Adventures of Pippi Longstocking. "

606
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,065
- Pippi!
- Yay! Pippi! "Annika, it's Pippi!"

607
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:08,170
"Pippi Longstocking" it is. Enjoy your film.

608
00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:10,858
How long has it been since we've seen "Pippi Longstocking?"

609
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:11,845
Too long.

610
00:30:11,938 --> 00:30:14,221
- That's gotta be one of our most watched films ever.
- Oh, it's up there.

611
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:16,157
I've seen it at least three times with you two.

612
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:17,591
Isn't it some kind of kids movie?

613
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:20,408
Wait a minute. Have you never seen this movie?

614
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:21,144
Never.

615
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,443
- We got us a "Pippi" virgin.
- I didn't think there were any left.

616
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:26,171
- And it's not a kids movie.
- It's a classic of surrealism.

617
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:28,404
- And bizarre cinematography.
- And atonal singing.

618
00:30:28,486 --> 00:30:29,331
And forced acting.

619
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:36,432
"Freckles on her nose, diddle diddle dee, a girl came riding,

620
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:40,615
into town one day, diddle diddle dee, was quite a sight.

621
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:44,741
It's Pippi Longstocking he ho ho ah he ha ha,

622
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:49,238
it's Pippi Longstocking there's no one like her.

623
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:53,073
Happy as can be, diddle diddle dippy, tells you stories

624
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,801
- you just wait and see, tra la la la la "
- What happened to her hair?

625
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:59,395
She's between stylists now. It's very awkward.

626
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:00,712
Unbelievable.

627
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:07,695
�A monkey and a horse, a suitcase full of golden coins and you amazed�

628
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:10,562
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.

629
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:14,898
Of course I will. I'll behave just like a fine lady.

630
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:19,568
Not a bad effect.

631
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,538
I don't think George Lucas is shaking in his boots, though.

632
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,055
I've always wanted to lift an immense quadruped over my head.

633
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,431
- What?
- I can't hear anything.

634
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:31,872
- Oh. I'll speak up.
- Not you - the movie.

635
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:33,956
Why do you wear such large shoes?

636
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:36,941
I love wiggling my toes, and I need plenty of room.

637
00:31:38,206 --> 00:31:39,794
Hey, look at her.

638
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:43,715
I still don't understand why every merchant in town takes her gold coins as payment

639
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:45,503
without questioning where she got them..

640
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:48,420
Her father's a cannibal king. Everyone knows they're lousy with gold.

641
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:50,243
This was a book, right? I should get the book.

642
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:53,837
Hey, you want to pass the popcorn there, buddy?

643
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:55,046
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

644
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:59,515
Oh, hey, we're below quarter full with the tub. You guys wanna fetch a refill?

645
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:00,709
Sure. And drinks.

646
00:32:00,806 --> 00:32:01,645
Thanks, Rory.

647
00:32:07,523 --> 00:32:11,056
- Kirk? Kirk?
- Yo.

648
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:13,273
- Hey, Lulu.
- Hi, Rory. Hi, Dean.

649
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:15,214
Hi. We're needing more popcorn.

650
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:16,954
Coming up.

651
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:18,736
Hold that thought

652
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:19,893
I will.

653
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:22,705
Boy, "Pippi"'s a great make-out movie.

654
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:26,017
Much better than "Blood on the Highway" or "That's my Daughter's Head. "

655
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:28,919
- Hey, Cool Hand?
- Hmm?

656
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:31,157
- Try to drop the 'tude.
- What 'tude?

657
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:33,220
You practically barked at Dean to pass the popcorn.

658
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:36,201
I didn't bark at him. Besides, he was hogging it.

659
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:38,634
Mm-hmm. Say "popcorn" more nicely, please.

660
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:40,558
- I'll try.
- Good.

661
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:43,133
Does he have to be all over her like that?

662
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:46,359
Who? Kirk? It's healthy for him. His complexion has never been better.

663
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:47,239
Dean.

664
00:32:47,997 --> 00:32:49,488
All they were doing was holding hands.

665
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,510
Yeah. It was that innocent.

666
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,340
Unless he has a third hand, he wasn't holding anything he wasn't supposed to be holding.

667
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:58,949
And the way he grabbed that drink from her and started slurping on it.

668
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:01,785
She gave it to him to drink. Come on, chill.

669
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,689
For me. And for Rory. It's important.

670
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:06,802
I said I will, and I will.

671
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:09,460
Thanks, guys.

672
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:11,729
- Thank you, Dean.
- No problem.

673
00:33:24,913 --> 00:33:25,676
Hi, Zach.

674
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:28,819
- I got something to say.
- Okay.

675
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:31,359
You've known me for two years. You've seen the good and the bad.

676
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:32,111
Oh, yeah!

677
00:33:33,587 --> 00:33:34,553
I mean, yes.

678
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:37,540
You probably know me better than most people, including my parents.

679
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:40,913
Neither of them have seen me cry during "Dances With Wolves," and you have.

680
00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:41,993
What's this about, Zach?

681
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,920
You, of all people, know that it takes me a while to process things, okay?

682
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:49,595
You saw how long it took me to get that chord change in "Brian's Tune. "

683
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:51,439
It was a tricky chord change. It wasn't your fault.

684
00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:53,425
Whatever. It's just the way it is.

685
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:57,266
Now, I may not be fast, but that's what we're dealing with here.

686
00:33:57,456 --> 00:34:02,180
And this issue with me and you is going to take longer than a chord change, okay?

687
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:02,842
Sure.

688
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:06,948
I hope you weren't expecting an "Officer and a Gentleman" kind of thing when I came in just now.

689
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:08,828
- I was not expecting that.
- Good.

690
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,518
- So we clear?
- Yes.

691
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:11,542
Good.

692
00:34:16,165 --> 00:34:17,640
- You want something to eat?
- Yes.

693
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:19,953
- Name it.
- Give me a minute, okay?

694
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:22,513
Sorry. Sure. Take a minute.

695
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:37,224
Did she own that house she lived in before she rode the horse into town,

696
00:34:37,259 --> 00:34:39,860
- or did she buy it with her gold coins?
- That's a good question.

697
00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:43,266
Oh, yeah, I see a prequel in the works. "The Adventures of Pippi in Escrow. "

698
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:45,446
- I'd go see it.
- So, beverages. Shout 'em out.

699
00:34:45,512 --> 00:34:46,352
- Water.
- Beer.

700
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:47,704
Yeah, beer sounds good.

701
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:50,915
Oh, you're serious. You want a beer?

702
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:54,847
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay. Bring him a beer. He's not driving... or 21.

703
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:58,441
- Fine. I won't have a beer.
- No, buddy, go ahead. Have a beer if you want one.

704
00:34:58,538 --> 00:35:02,102
- You're tall. You've got slacks. You can have one.
- I don't want one anymore.

705
00:35:02,178 --> 00:35:04,862
- Can I substitute something for you?
- Water, I guess.

706
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:07,401
Put some barley and hops in it, buddy. No one's judging here.

707
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:09,675
- Water.
- We have good water here, right Mom?

708
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:12,654
Oh, yeah - and I'll bring out a couple of extra beers, and those of us who want them

709
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:16,152
can grab them as need be. Just keep an eye on Rory, or she'll grab them all for herself.

710
00:35:16,223 --> 00:35:19,650
- I'll try to refrain. Need help?
- No, you stay, entertain. I'll be right back.

711
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,799
Hey, remember when you guys were on a softball team together?

712
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:33,775
It was just a pickup game.

713
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:40,676
But you guys played a neighboring town, right? I forget which one.

714
00:35:40,835 --> 00:35:46,734
Um... but I do remember that you guys did Stars Hollow proud.

715
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:50,342
In fact, I think it's probably the best team Stars Hollow has ever thrown.

716
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:55,326
Or however you would word that phrase I attempted in the proper softball vernacular.

717
00:35:55,429 --> 00:35:57,157
Yeah, well, I haven't played in awhile.

718
00:35:57,992 --> 00:35:58,816
Same here.

719
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:01,828
Dum de dum dum dum.

720
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:03,132
What's that? A song?

721
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,175
No, it's just dum de dum dum.

722
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:08,530
Okay. Well, here are the beverages.

723
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,978
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

724
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:12,079
I'll be right back.

725
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:13,619
Where are you going?

726
00:36:14,546 --> 00:36:18,535
- It's time to bring out the Bop It.
- Bop It! Yes, yes! Good idea.

727
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:21,908
Hey, look what I found. Bop It! Who wants to play?

728
00:36:21,986 --> 00:36:24,494
- I want to play!
- Let's all play. You guys know how to play?

729
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:26,547
- I've played it here before.
- Yeah, he has.

730
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:28,197
Yeah, I remember. Hey, Cool Hand.

731
00:36:28,877 --> 00:36:33,228
- What is it?
- Oh, well... each guy holds one of the handles.

732
00:36:33,387 --> 00:36:38,220
And you start up, and then you do whatever it says. You twist it or pull it or Bop It until one of you's out.

733
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,934
Watch. I'll be yellow. You be green.

734
00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:47,350
Twist it. Pull it. Bop it. Yellow. Flick it. Ow!

735
00:36:49,152 --> 00:36:49,997
Okay, you try it.

736
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:50,816
Come on.

737
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:54,923
It looks like Luke is green, and Dean is yellow.

738
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:57,688
We've got ourselves a contest here.

739
00:36:57,755 --> 00:36:58,383
Yep.

740
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,887
- You wanna do a practice run?
- It's not that complicated.

741
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:02,259
Okay. Here we go.

742
00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:08,526
Twist it. Spin it. Pull it.

743
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:11,980
Pull it. Flick it.

744
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:15,966
- Don't hurt the Bop It, guys. It's got feelings too.
- Pull it. Bop it.

745
00:37:16,472 --> 00:37:19,071
- Looks like it's a draw.
- Good going, guys. Why don't you take a break?

746
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:24,060
Green. Twist it. Twist it. Twist it. Bop it. Ow!

747
00:37:25,427 --> 00:37:28,843
- Green wins!
- Yeah! In your face! In your face!

748
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:30,994
- Fine. You won.
- I hammered you, buddy.

749
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:33,267
- It's just a stupid game.
- Says the loser.

750
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:36,554
- I gotta go.
- Already?

751
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,631
Yeah, it's getting late. Thank you, Lorelai. Thanks for everything.

752
00:37:39,714 --> 00:37:41,004
You're welcome, Dean. Anytime.

753
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,709
I'll call you later.

754
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:44,122
Okay. Yeah, call me.

755
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:48,945
- Thanks a lot.
- What did I do?

756
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:49,579
Rory...

757
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:52,307
We shouldn't have gone out like this if people didn't want to.

758
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,111
No, Rory, I wanted to.

759
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:56,383
- You made no effort.
- I did. I swear.

760
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:59,594
- Look, we can talk about this later.
- He had some sort of chip on his shoulder.

761
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:03,251
Oh, come on, Luke. You're the reason we had to pull out the Bop It.

762
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:03,766
What?

763
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,451
Bop It's what we bring out for social gatherings that need mouth to mouth.

764
00:38:06,547 --> 00:38:09,480
- I'm going back to school.
- Rory, wait. I feel awful here.

765
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:12,288
No, it's okay. Whatever. Bye, Mom.

766
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,037
- Bye, honey. Drive safely.
- Yeah, drive safe.

767
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:20,074
I feel awful.

768
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:22,809
Well, it's - you know, it's my fault. I forced this.

769
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,924
It's not your fault. I shouldn't have said yes to a double date.

770
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:30,243
- Well, I wanted to do this.
- But I can't be around that guy.

771
00:38:30,314 --> 00:38:32,828
- I knew that, and I said yes anyway.
- Why can't you be around him?

772
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,194
- Because he's not good for her.
- Luke...

773
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:39,059
- He's not. He's not right for her.
- You're mad at Dean from years past.

774
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:42,243
What's past is past. They're a couple now. Do you even remember why you're mad at him?

775
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:45,905
He's a punk. That's what I remember. Just look at his history. He broke her heart before.

776
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:48,265
Their problems were mutual. You don't know the whole story.

777
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,743
He got married and bailed out before the honeymoon was even over.

778
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:55,899
- When you're young, you make mistakes.
- He was pining for Rory, and he got married. That's unstable.

779
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,100
- He's 19. Give him a break.
- He doesn't know what he wants.

780
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:01,562
He's proven that. How can Rory trust him now?

781
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:04,649
Matters of the heart are not science. There are no sure things.

782
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:07,077
- He's not good enough for her.
- Well, who is? Jess?

783
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:10,954
No, not Jess. A prince, maybe. One that's in line to be king.

784
00:39:11,029 --> 00:39:14,219
Not one of those waiting-for-a-brother-to-die ones, but a real one.

785
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:19,102
If not a prince, someone who's gonna be good for her. You know, Rory is like Pippi.

786
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,781
- Pippi?
- She can have adventures and be free, she's smart.

787
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:24,094
The whole world's waiting for her.

788
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:26,962
You're comparing Rory to Pippi Longstocking?

789
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:31,090
Pippi is strong and independent. She can lift a horse above her head. Uh-huh.

790
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:36,061
And beat up bullies and build a hot-air balloon. She's unique, like Rory.

791
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:40,162
But I guarantee you, if Pippi had met Dean, there would be no horse, no balloons.

792
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:44,315
He'd drag her down to his level, spend all her gold coins, and poof, like that, all her dreams would be gone.

793
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,083
It's Rory's choice who she chooses to be with. Not yours, not mine.

794
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:52,287
Does it feel right to you? Are you okay with this Rory-and-Dean thing?

795
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:57,381
I just need this to work.

796
00:39:59,674 --> 00:40:00,489
Look at me.

797
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:04,958
Not stopping till he's upset every person that means anything in the world to him in one night.

798
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,385
- You want a beer?
- Yes.

799
00:40:26,352 --> 00:40:27,974
Maybe if I brought out the Twister.

800
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:30,671
Maybe.

801
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:34,906
Who is it?

802
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:37,798
I hope this isn't a bad time.

803
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,415
No, I was just catching up on some correspondence.

804
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:46,097
I just wanted to let you know that our property tax bill is wrong this year. I'm contesting it.

805
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:48,705
In case they call here, I wanted to let you know.

806
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:50,998
- Fine. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

807
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:54,966
Oh, and I've joined a barbershop quartet.

808
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:58,689
Yeah, we do it up right. Dress in period costumes.

809
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:04,188
These silly vests and things. We've performed a couple of times at charity events.

810
00:41:04,618 --> 00:41:07,285
- All right.
- It's part of a barbershop chorus.

811
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:09,790
- That's a group of about 30.
- Very good.

812
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,759
I guess I'll be going.

813
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,367
I bought a panic room.

814
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:18,339
Very good.

815
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:30,080
- Hey.
- Hi.

816
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:34,478
- Well, I guess that was a bust, huh?
- Sorry.

817
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:37,570
- Maybe it was too soon.
- Well, your mom was real nice.

818
00:41:37,632 --> 00:41:40,146
- She was great. Thank her for me, okay?
- I will.

819
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:43,250
It was fun for a while there, though, wasn't it?

820
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:46,596
Yeah. The movie was. It was real fun.

821
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:47,657
Like the old days.

822
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:49,484
Like the old days.

823
00:41:51,913 --> 00:41:55,143
I'd invite you over, but Kyle's entertaining some buddies.

824
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:56,192
I should go anyway.

825
00:41:57,545 --> 00:41:59,628
- Want a ride?
- I'm almost there.

826
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:00,919
Okay. Kiss.

827
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:03,822
- Bye.
- Bye.

828
