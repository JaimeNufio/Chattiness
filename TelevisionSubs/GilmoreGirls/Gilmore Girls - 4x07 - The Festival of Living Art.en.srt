1
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,522
- Morning.
- Morning.

2
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:13,763
Hey, would you be horrified if I started clipping coupons again?

3
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:16,697
- Yes.
- Oh, well, then, I won't.

4
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,329
- Wait, did you say again?
- I meant ever.

5
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,007
- When did you clip coupons before?
- I didn't. I misspoke. Whoops.

6
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,880
Hey, how is it that your dirty laundry has increased exponentially since you started Yale?

7
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:29,713
'Cause I'm a dirty, filthy Yale girl now.

8
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,852
- I told you I'm not gonna clip them!
- Then I don't see the problem.

9
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,689
Just for the Fig Newtons, please!

10
00:00:35,324 --> 00:00:37,588
- Whoa! That is...
- Sucks.

11
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:39,620
That is totally sucks.

12
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:42,052
And they're like on their two hundredth guitarist audition.

13
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:44,673
Well, they must be down to the deaf, dumb, and blind ones.

14
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:48,944
- Ah, he found it.
- Found what?

15
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,428
The lost chord.

16
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,403
So, the washer's broken.

17
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:57,612
You didn't mention that when you saw me walk out with my exponential amounts of laundry.

18
00:00:57,677 --> 00:00:58,457
Sorry.

19
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,790
Or when I called from Yale to say that I had exponential amounts of laundry to do.

20
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,460
You've totally co-opted my word.

21
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:07,535
Okay, plethora - that's my word. I have a plethora of dirty laundry and nowhere to do it.

22
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:11,231
But you don't come home to do your laundry. You come home to see your mama.

23
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,356
No, this time I came home to do my laundry.

24
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:15,768
All right. I'll call the repairman A.S.A.P.

25
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,339
- Hey, you hear that?
- What?

26
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:19,588
- No music.
- And the band stopped playing, too.

27
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:22,177
- Hi, Lane.
- How's it going there?

28
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:38,398
You think she can hear us?

29
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,542
I think out of self-defense her ears have become vestigial organs.

30
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:44,461
- I'm not clipping coupons!
- Then I don't see the problem.

31
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:46,358
- Hey, it's your friendly neighborhood Lorelai.
- I'm in the kitchen!

32
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:48,179
- Good morning.
- Is it?

33
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:51,436
Just spreading that love and sunshine around, huh, buddy?

34
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:55,210
Lorelai, this is Beau, Jackson's brother. Beau, this is our friend Lorelai.

35
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,413
Come on. Let's leave Oscar Wilde here to his reading.

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,327
- What's with the 'tude?
- Jackson asked Beau to be here for the birth.

37
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:04,696
Which was supposed to happen a week ago.

38
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:09,043
So Beau's missing way more work than he thought he would, and he's letting me know it.

39
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:11,379
Yeah, it would be nice if God gave us women a pop-up thing

40
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:14,681
when a baby's done like on a turkey, but he chose not to. Hey, Jackson.

41
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:17,866
Hi. This extra time is great, huh? I'm getting so much done.

42
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:20,497
I know. I'm still storing meals. I've got two weeks worth.

43
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:22,391
- Hey, Jackson?
- {111}{000}Yeah, Beau?

44
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,757
- What day is it today?
- It's Saturday, Beau.

45
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,628
I get time and a half on Saturdays.

46
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:30,211
It gets me my fun things. Otherwise, it's all just bill paying.

47
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:33,297
- Have I apologized to you enough?
- Yes, Daddy, you have.

48
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:35,771
So, I got the plastic sheet on the bed. It fits perfectly.

49
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,234
- Excellent.
- What's that for?

50
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:38,606
- She doesn't know?
- Know about what?

51
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:40,864
You ready? This is big. It's really good,

52
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:43,174
and I want you to slowly drink it in. No big gulps.

53
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:44,291
I'm ready to take a sip.

54
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:46,404
We're skipping the hospital and having the baby here.

55
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:48,458
- Here in your house?
- In our bed.

56
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:50,506
- Hence the sheet.
- Got a honey of a sheet.

57
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:55,046
It's the top of the line. The little thing will come out and carom right down into the catcher's arms.

58
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,911
While we all yell, "hey, batter, batter, batter"?

59
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:59,885
He means the midwife. Got the best one on the eastern seaboard.

60
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02,564
- You look mystified.
- No, it's just...

61
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:04,863
you guys have done a lot of research on this, right?

62
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:07,012
Millions of babies have been born this way.

63
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:08,487
It's a great tradition.

64
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,576
And hospitals are so cold, you know, so full of infections.

65
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,943
- And dead people.
- And sometimes the dead people have infections.

66
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:17,549
- And if they're not dead yet, they die.
- All true.

67
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,182
But the best thing about having little Davey or Colgate here...

68
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:22,587
zero chance of bringing home the wrong baby.

69
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:26,208
What comes out of her here, stays here. Oh, I got something for you.

70
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:29,818
It's a baby pager. It'll go off when Sookie's close.

71
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:34,097
- Oh, cute.
- Scott Joplin seemed appropriately sunny.

72
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:36,526
I want you to be here even if home birth disgusts you.

73
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:38,819
Of course I'll be here. Nothing could keep me away.

74
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,968
Extra buckets - I gotta put it on the list.

75
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:44,605
Extra buckets? What's that... Never mind.

76
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,778
Excuse me. Can my girlfriend and I sit here? This is my girlfriend.

76
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:54,978
- My girlfriend and I appreciate it.
- Yes, thank you.

77
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:56,687
I got a pretty polite girlfriend.

78
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:59,570
- Should we be nervous about this?
- I don't know.

79
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:02,156
Did Taylor tell anyone why he called an emergency meeting?

80
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,219
He said nothing to me or my girlfriend.

81
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:07,680
I can't remember the last town emergency meeting he called.

82
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,086
- Me and my girlfriend can't either.
- Home birth?

83
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:12,309
I was horrified and I hid it horribly.

84
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,064
I wanted to be supportive but throw up at the same time.

85
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:17,311
- A plastic sheet?
- I saw it.

86
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:21,934
It was the same one that boy who couldn't hold it had to use in that after-school special.

87
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:24,305
- What was that called?
- "It's Not Benny's Fault."

88
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,157
Oh, God. It was so insane. It's what hospitals are for.

89
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,674
- Hey, Lane, there's a seat behind my girlfriend.
- That's okay, Kirk.

90
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:38,518
Get this. I just found the most amazing guitarist - a phenom.

91
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:41,078
He was cool on the phone, and we're meeting him tomorrow.

92
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:43,423
- That's great.
- I'm trying not to get my hopes up,

93
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,605
but I've already figured out that our Spin cover

94
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:49,199
should be against a bloodred backdrop with a skull hovering over us.

95
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:53,086
- Oh, well, very Norman Rockwell.
- That woman's staring at me.

96
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,973
Oh, Mrs. Van-uppity? Well, maybe you're just her type.

97
00:05:56,209 --> 00:06:00,222
People, thank you for assembling on such short notice.

98
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,948
What's up, Taylor?

99
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,805
My girlfriend was wondering that, too.

100
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:08,353
As you know, every year, one lucky town in Connecticut

101
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:11,306
gets to host "The Festival of Living Pictures,"

102
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:17,073
a show which presents onstage recreations of famous works of art,

103
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:23,441
statues, paintings, et cetera, with real people posing as the figures in the art.

104
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:27,369
We hosted it seven years ago - successfully, I might add.

105
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:29,320
- Yeah, it was a blast.
- Definitely.

106
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:31,117
My girlfriend's gonna love this.

107
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:34,240
The town of Woodbury was supposed to host it this year,

108
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:38,075
but because of recent flooding, they canceled at the last minute,

109
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:43,748
and I offered Stars Hollow to be the host. How does that sound?

110
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,104
- Cool.
- Yeah, sign us up.

111
00:06:46,236 --> 00:06:48,659
Yeah, Taylor, you finally did something right.

112
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,524
- Your beard is so sexy.
- How much time do we have?

113
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:58,642
One week. And as per tradition, we need to come up with one original recreation

114
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:01,519
to go with all the others that are in the show every year.

115
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:04,480
- Well, that's not a lot of time.
- Yeah, Taylor, is it even possible?

116
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:06,486
Well, it'll have to be.

117
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,433
I've already assured Hank, who is the Taylor Doose of Woodbury,

118
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:16,399
that we'd take it over successfully. It's a challenge, people, but doable.

119
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:20,397
Now, I would like to introduce you to a key player

120
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,106
in our execution of this endeavor,

121
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:27,684
the head of the Connecticut Arts Council, Buff Otis.

122
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:31,477
- Hey, it's your future wife.
- Shut up.

123
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,239
Would you like to say a few words, Mrs. Otis?

124
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,564
Your enthusiasm... shocks me.

125
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:42,573
- Is that good?
- Hard to tell.

126
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:44,420
- It might be.
- Scary broad.

127
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:47,476
I will be managing the event and emceeing.

128
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:50,338
Miss Patty, you will be stage-managing.

129
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:53,438
Lorelai, if you could help organize the costumes?

130
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:56,207
I'm here for you and your sexy beard, Taylor.

131
00:07:57,215 --> 00:08:01,834
Everyone should sign up now if you want to be considered to be cast in one of the recreations.

132
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,322
Mrs. Otis and I will make the final decisions.

133
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:08,224
Hey, you're gonna be the girl in that Renoir painting again, right?

134
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,862
You were such a doll in that.

135
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:11,625
Oh, I'm sure I can be persuaded.

136
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:14,517
This is an enormous challenge, people,

137
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,605
but I say we do it and do it well. Meeting adjourned.

138
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,359
- Wait.
- Why?

139
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:24,787
I want to see if she asks you out.

140
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:29,058
I wonder if I want to be something other than the Renoir girl.

141
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:32,356
I'm sorry, the audience has come to expect you in the role of Renoir girl.

142
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:34,162
You can't disappoint them. It's a plum role.

143
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,237
True, true.

144
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:38,955
Sorry I took so long. I was dealing with more divorce-lawyer stuff.

145
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:41,486
Good Lord, is Nicole's lawyer still harassing you?

146
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:46,287
No, mine was. And please don't point out the irony of my paying a lawyer to work for me.

147
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:49,508
Okay, but then you're gonna owe me something else I can ironically comment on.

148
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:52,005
Fine. Hey, what was that emergency meeting all about?

149
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,065
We're hosting "The Festival of Living Pictures" again.

150
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:57,545
- Oh, joy.
- His lack of enthusiasm shocks me.

151
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,209
You're involving yourself in this thing? It's such a stupid waste of time.

152
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,216
I just thought of the perfect painting for Luke to be in. "Cranky Guy in Baseball Cap."

153
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:05,676
Was that Manet or Monet?

154
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:07,877
That was mustard on my hamburger and a side of fries, please.

155
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:10,258
- She's the queen of segues.
- She's the queen of something.

156
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,718
- You want your usual?
- Yes, please.

157
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:16,464
Maybe I'll just be a backstage person this year. There's less pressure.

158
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:17,949
You don't have to get made up, and...

159
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,399
- What are they doing?
- Well, I bet she's coming to...

160
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:25,343
Hey, and no more inappropriate lesbian references, please.

161
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:26,331
All right.

162
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,488
Oh, you know what? I bet you're in line for the new painting they're cooking up.

163
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:32,203
I feel like a used car.

164
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,189
- Turn to the side.
- What?

165
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,815
Turn to the side. We need to see your profile.

166
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:40,595
- Just what I thought.
- This is a violation of my civil rights.

167
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:43,324
You better do what John Ashcroft says or they may just follow us home.

168
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:44,650
Unbelievable.

169
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:50,160
Other way. Other way.

170
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,290
I'm a Yale student, for God's sake.

171
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,275
Thank you.

172
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,135
- Crazy, doofus town.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:04,767
Let's not loiter around the cast sheets, people. Find your name and then move on.

174
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,825
Oh, cool. I'm gonna be some statue.

175
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:09,323
You're "The Reaper," Andrew...

176
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:13,302
a prize work at Versailles and a prize role, not some statue.

177
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:15,580
So I get to be painted all white, huh?

178
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,089
Yes, that's what that means.

179
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:20,665
Hi, Taylor. When are the costumes getting here?

180
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:23,235
Hank in Woodbury swears they're en route,

181
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:25,887
but you gotta double and triple-check with that guy.

182
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,403
Hank's the you in Woodbury.

183
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:30,997
A real ninny. He's praying we don't pull this off,

184
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,243
- but that only inspires me to work harder.
- I need to see the list.

185
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:38,726
- Watch the elbows, Kirk.
- I just need to see the list.

186
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,499
He's going to be very happy.

187
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:44,206
- What'd you get, Kirk?
- Christ in "The Last Supper."

188
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,504
- The big kahuna.
- I'm gonna do it right, too.

189
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:49,942
- Lots of research. What's a good book to read?
- The bible?

190
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:52,761
Right. Yo, where are my apostles? Where are my homeboys?

191
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:55,542
- James, son of Alpheus, give me five.
- All right.

192
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,917
Simon, the Canaanite, don't leave me hanging.

193
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:01,097
- I say we go celebrate. How 'bout Shakey's?
- All right.

194
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:04,968
- That is one happy Christ.
- Well, it was nice of you guys to give him that.

195
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:08,025
Oh, I wanted to show you this. It's our original picture.

196
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:14,497
We think Rory would be perfect for it. It's called "Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea."

197
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:17,308
- Wow, that's Rory.
- Do you think she'll do it?

198
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:20,395
- Well, you got some sway with me.
- Good, good.

199
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:23,128
- Okay, I'm confused.
- I should go make my calls.

200
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:28,730
- I'm not the... Renoir girl.
- Oh, really? I didn't realize that...

201
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:30,953
Patty, I'm the spitting image of the Renoir girl.

202
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,936
I played her seven years ago and received the proper accolades. This is a mistake.

203
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:35,852
Maybe.

204
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:38,735
- Taylor?
- Yes, Lorelai?

205
00:11:38,877 --> 00:11:42,421
I'm not listed as the Renoir girl. Is that a mistake?

206
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:45,857
- Frankly, no, it's not.
- Okay, I'm not listed as anything else, either.

207
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,372
That's also correct. You'll be helping with costumes.

208
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,824
I don't get it. Why am I not the Renoir girl? I'm the spitting image.

209
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:52,621
You are. Your look is perfect.

210
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:54,193
Then why am I not the Renoir girl?

211
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,236
- I really have to tell you why?
- Yes, you do.

212
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,381
- You flinched.
- I what?

213
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:00,311
Seven years ago, the curtain opened.

214
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:04,244
You were posed in the painting, then you flinched noticeably.

215
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,029
- I did not flinch.
- We thought you were having an attack.

216
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:10,792
- I did not flinch!
- You almost knocked Terrence over.

217
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,516
- I did not!
- The whole town saw it.

218
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:18,298
And with Hank from Woodbury looking over my shoulder, I'm not taking any risks.

219
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,041
- Patty, please, back me up here.
- Honey, I'm sorry, you flinched!

220
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:24,468
- Big-time.
- You almost knocked Terrence over.

221
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:27,012
Yeah, you screwed the pooch, so you're out. I'm sorry.

222
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:30,198
So, you'll ask Rory about the painting?

223
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:37,677
- It's humiliating!
- You and the Renoir girl - it was a lock.

224
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,463
Yeah, until this smear campaign.

225
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,392
- There's a lot of tension in the air here.
- Well, it's midterms.

226
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:48,798
- You seem calm.
- Well, on the outside.

227
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,102
Is this what you're using, Dream Fresh laundry powder?

228
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,186
- It's a new brand.
- It's an off-brand.

229
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,153
It leaves your clothes with that Dream-Fresh scent.

230
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:56,703
You used a coupon, didn't you?

231
00:12:56,812 --> 00:13:00,285
Thirty-five cents off or not, I still would have chosen Dream Fresh.

232
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:03,758
- So, who'd they pick for the Renoir girl?
- Carol Dandridge.

233
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,304
- Carol Dandridge?
- Carol Dandruff from now on!

234
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:09,667
Okay, now, don't take it out on poor Carol. It's not like she lobbied for it.

235
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,384
I bet she did. That would be just like that old porky, doody-dridge.

236
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,536
Oh, wow. You're really bummed about this, aren't you?

237
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:20,195
On the outside, I am a mature adult who's able to put setbacks like this in their proper place,

238
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,494
and on the inside, I just wanna wear that pretty dress again!

239
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,807
- You will.
- Yeah, if a brick lands

240
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,034
on Taylor's head and he suddenly likes me again. Oh, a brick.

241
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:30,301
You don't need a brick. You have me. I'll take care of it.

242
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:33,322
- What are you talking about?
- You are going to be the Renoir girl. End of story.

243
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:35,360
How?
- Well, if they want an Anthea

244
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:39,378
for "Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea," then they're going to have to have you for the Renoir girl.

245
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:43,078
Well, look at you folding your laundry all haughty and powerful.

246
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:45,621
Bada-bing all over his nice ivy-league suit.

247
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,001
Rory, you couldn't do that. Come on.

248
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:50,875
It would be embarrassing, it would be manipulative, and can you do it tonight?

249
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,238
I think I'll wait until the Anthea costume is perfectly fitted to my specifications.

250
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:57,663
- Then we won't have no surprises.
- I am in awe.

251
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,737
- Pass me the Dream Fresh?
- I wouldn't dare not to.

252
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:03,858
I don't know about you, but I'm completely jazzed about this.

253
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,019
This is the first time I've been excited about playing since Dave.

254
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,259
If he's half as good as this tape, I'm gonna plotz.

255
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:13,039
- Can we help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Lane.

256
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,872
- I'm Lane.
- Am I late?

257
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,408
- For?
- The audition.

258
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:18,249
- For?
- I'm Gil!

259
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:25,306
Gil. No, you're right on time. Come on in.

260
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:30,960
Primo space.

261
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,519
- Primo.
- How you guys doin'?

262
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,998
- I'm Brian.
- Zach.

263
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,894
- Where do you guys want me?
- Right there's good.

264
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,830
How's your research coming along, Kirk?

265
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,306
Good, although I got off to a slow start.

266
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:51,541
I didn't realize Jesus wasn't in the Old Testament 'til I hit page 368.

267
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,592
- Hey, Taylor.
- Hello.

268
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:58,270
I took a quick survey of the costumes. Looks like everything's here and accounted for.

269
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,450
- And the Renoir girl dress still fits you?
- Like a glove.

270
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:05,162
So help me, if you make me look bad in front of Hank from Woodbury,

271
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:06,912
there is gonna be hell to pay.

272
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:08,754
Sorry.

273
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,593
Hey, I'm here for a fitting.

274
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:12,376
You've come to the right place. What are you in?

275
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:15,969
- "The Last Supper."
- Oh, you must be one of my missing apostles.

276
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:19,291
- Still haven't met them all. I'm Christ.
- It's gonna be a lot of fun, huh?

277
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,985
- Definitely. Which apostle are you?
- Judas.

278
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:25,308
- Judas.
- So, where do I go for my fitting?

279
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:27,453
Oh, I think you know where you're going, pal.

280
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:29,245
Right through that flap. I'll meet you back there.

281
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:32,641
Thanks. So I heard you and all the apostles are going to Shakey's later.

282
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:34,908
You heard wrong, friend. We're not going to Shakey's.

283
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:37,130
Oh, okay. Maybe some other time.

284
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:38,978
Yeah, some other time.

285
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:26,832
- Man, you guys are fantastic!
- Yeah, you too.

286
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,009
- Really good, Gil.
- I mean it's tight, you know. It feels right.

287
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:33,128
- Definitely.
- It's got a feel that...

288
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,238
- Feels right.
- You want to do another one?

289
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,063
Sure.

290
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,929
Just give me one minute to call work.

291
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,977
I own a sandwich shop in Salisbury and I gotta check in every once in a while or it's chaos.

292
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:47,336
I'll be right back. Awesome, guys! Really!

293
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:48,729
Back at ya!

294
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:56,302
He's... he's...

295
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:59,102
Old. Just say it, dude. Grandpa's old.

296
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,534
- He's not a grandpa.
- Did you know how old he was?

297
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:05,492
- He sounded young on the phone.
- Right here, he's got some lines.

298
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,169
- That blows my mind.
- What is he, late thirties?

299
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:09,681
- Approaching forty.
- Forty?

300
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,995
He was alive before man walked on the moon.

301
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:13,598
Don't do that, man. You're freaking me out.

302
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:17,935
Let's not be over-dramatic, guys. I mean, he is an incredible guitarist.

303
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,529
- He's had a lot of time to practice.
- And the bicentennial - he was alive for that.

304
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,202
This is the best we've sounded since Dave, and he's really...

305
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:25,793
- Elderly.
- Excited.

306
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:29,577
- He was our age when we were born.
- He thinks we're great

307
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,495
- There were no cd's when he was born.
- Stop it, man. I mean it.

308
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:34,369
Maybe there's a way to offset his oldness.

309
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:38,142
Put a hat on him. Dress him up like Angus Young in AC/DC - that schoolboy outfit.

310
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:40,325
He could have seen AC/DC with their original lead singer.

311
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:43,996
And 1980 is when that guy choked on his own vomit. That's old.

312
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:45,971
- You want to stop the audition?
- We shouldn't be rude.

313
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:47,784
- Good.
- Fine, we'll keep going,

314
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,902
but remember, any new member has to be approved by all of us.

315
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:53,278
- So one vote against, and he's back at bingo.
- I know.

316
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:57,901
Cindy knows where the extra prosciutto is, Kevin. Ask her.

317
00:17:57,988 --> 00:18:02,350
Come on, I've told you before, when I'm not there, Cindy is me, okay?

318
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,557
I'll check in later. Bye.

319
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:09,401
Kids, man. In one ear and out the other.

320
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,425
Come on. Let's rock!

321
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:20,163
Ooh, balloons! Sad, little, droopy balloons.

322
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:23,952
- We got 'em too soon.
- Oh. Hey, you feeling okay?

323
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:26,732
Fine. Bruce just suggested a little afternoon rest.

324
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,231
- Bruce? Who's he?
- She.

325
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:29,866
- It's a last name.
- Who's she?

326
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:31,867
Best midwife on the eastern seaboard.

327
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:36,071
So it's gonna be another fifty bucks to change the flight again?

328
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:39,938
That's six and a half hours take-home after taxes, disability, and FICA.

329
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,994
And the Oscar for biggest blubber baby goes to...

330
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:47,120
No, no, go ahead. Put me down for it. I got no choice.

331
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:50,326
She sounded hot.

332
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:54,017
Hey, Beau, why don't you go take a little walk? You know, go do something.

333
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,062
Yeah, good idea.

334
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:59,527
But there's nothing to do in this hick town, not like back in Bogalusa.

335
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:02,153
Hey, Beau, why don't you come help me pick the zucchini in the back?

336
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:07,165
I got a couple of giant Miracle Gro ones out there. Huh? It'll tickle you.

337
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,451
That might be something.

338
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:12,739
- Wow, you can cut the sexual tension with a knife.
- Don't joke.

339
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,280
The bedroom is now prepared for the baby.

340
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:17,718
Your husband tried, but he screwed up, so I fixed it.

341
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,294
Thank you, Bruce.

342
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:23,539
- There's someone new here.
- Bruce, this is my best friend I was telling you about, Lorelai.

343
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:30,006
I heard you were the best midwife on the eastern seaboard. May I call you Bruce?

344
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:31,808
- Everyone does.
- Then I will call you Bruce.

345
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,862
- You're anti-midwife.
- Pardon me?

346
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,358
There's anti-midwife energy in this room and it wasn't here when I left it.

347
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:41,403
- Well, it's not coming from me.
- Yeah, Bruce, Lorelai is pro-you, all the way.

348
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,389
I'll be in the bedroom.

349
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:49,656
Wow, that woman's got strong hands.

350
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,988
She ate a whole jar of crunchy peanut butter in one sitting.

351
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:54,557
I would want a woman just like that yanking the baby out of me.

352
00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:57,750
- Please lay on your side, Sookie.
- Yeah, sorry.

353
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:01,530
This is the position I'm going to be in for the baby. She wants me to get used to it.

354
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:04,540
- Less tearing this way.
- Oh, smack that image right out of my head.

355
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:07,750
- I beg your pardon?
- Hey, you know, Bruce spent two years

356
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:10,454
in China educating poor villagers on female issues.

357
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,374
Oh, I hear they got great Chinese food there.

358
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:15,037
A card.

359
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:17,274
You're the friend who's going to be there, right?

360
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:20,751
- With rings on my fingers and bells on my toes.
- You'll leave the negativity at home?

361
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:23,607
Bruce, I swear, I am Miss Positivity.

362
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:28,513
I swear, I am not anti-midwife. I mean, that would be as dumb as being,

363
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:30,413
I don't know, anti-best friend. Don't you think?

364
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:34,934
- You're the one who asked me out to pick zucchinis.
- Right. Pick them, not kick them.

365
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:38,405
- You used to be fun. Now you're just a big-city phony.
- Beau!

366
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:41,333
- What did I say before?
- I wasn't listening.

367
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:45,394
The baby will come when the baby comes. We're all here to serve the baby. Jackson!

368
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:47,262
- What?
- How are you serving the baby?

369
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,608
- I could go get more balloons?
- Good.

370
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:53,279
- And, Beau, how are you serving the baby?
- I could help Jackson with balloons.

371
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:56,073
- You need two men for that?
- I could get... flowers.

372
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:56,985
Good!

373
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:02,395
Okay, we're going to get balloons and flowers.

374
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,788
She didn't give me any instructions.

375
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:10,374
- Should I move?
- I wouldn't yet.

376
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:17,179
- This is nice.
- It is a beautiful day.

377
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:19,939
- Good suggestion.
- You think Bruce was just trying to get rid of us?

378
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:23,333
You, yes. But Bruce is there for the baby, and I've got the baby.

379
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:25,381
- Have you checked that recently?
- What?

380
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:29,441
Are you sure she hasn't taken the baby and shoved a pillow under there when you weren't looking?

381
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:31,065
- Oh my God!
- What?

382
00:21:31,177 --> 00:21:33,260
- You haven't popped yet.
- Not yet.

383
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:35,211
It's like an elephant's gestation.

384
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,448
Thanks for the very welcome perspective on that, Andrew.

385
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:41,572
Hey, how's the research going, Kirk?

386
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:46,558
Good. I'm using the clothing to get into character and I've been focusing on historical foods.

387
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,871
- Christ ate a lot of lentils.
- No utensils back then?

388
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:55,201
- No, they had utensils.
- This is a disaster, an unmitigated disaster!

389
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:58,794
- What happened?
- We're missing half the table for "The Last Supper."

390
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,699
- Drag.
- This is Hank from Woodbury's doing.

391
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,010
- That little fink only shipped half the table on purpose.
- No, I just talked to him, Taylor,

392
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:10,580
- and he swears he shipped everything they had.
- Let's think here. There's gotta be a way to do this.

393
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:15,301
Just add a card table to the end or some TV trays. It'll be like a funky Last Supper.

394
00:22:15,363 --> 00:22:17,595
"The Last Supper" cannot be funky.

395
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:21,359
Or we could just make do with what we have and crowd all the apostles around it.

396
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:24,594
- Or eliminate some of the apostles.
- This is not going to work.

397
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,434
- I think we're just gonna have to throw in the towel.
- I think you might be right, Taylor.

398
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:31,942
- This just might be a sign to pack it in.
- So no festival?

399
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:34,809
- No festival.
- I have to keep moving.

400
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,089
- Okay, start packing it up, people.
- You would fold?

401
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,472
What was that, Kirk?

402
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:44,235
You would fold due simply to hardship?

403
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:47,938
Not now, Kirk. Keep everything where it is, guys.

404
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:49,468
No reason to unload it just to load it again.

405
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:52,979
Would you follow blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel?

406
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:56,046
Oh, that's your blood sugar talking, sweetie. Eat a candy bar.

407
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:59,120
- This is but a crisis of faith.
- I said not now, Kirk.

408
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:01,946
- Let him talk. What's the harm?
- When the road to your destination

409
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:06,026
is revealed to be long and dusty, is your destination's value so diminished?

410
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:11,049
- Well, I suppose not, but still...
- If a storm mars your camp for the night,

411
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:15,600
is it wise to search for high ground or hold your camp 'til the light of new day?

412
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:18,729
Well, it's something to think about.

413
00:23:18,827 --> 00:23:22,524
A crisis of faith can be delivered, but one must believe to be delivered.

414
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,810
No way am I building that table out for them, no way.

415
00:23:25,897 --> 00:23:28,733
- Anyone ask you to, Jose?
- Nope, but they're going to.

416
00:23:28,816 --> 00:23:32,892
- They'll just get Tom to do it.
- The contractor? No, he's too busy with his own stuff.

417
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,602
- You having twins?
- No.

418
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:38,016
- You sure?
- Let me think about it for another millisecond - no!

419
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:40,954
- It looks like you're having twins.
- You're gonna make me fall in love with you, Luke.

420
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:43,086
- It would take me hours.
- What would?

421
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:46,895
The table. It's gotta be built out in forced perspective. It's complicated.

422
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:49,045
Throw a stick and you can find someone to fix that table.

423
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:51,426
So grab a stick and throw it because I'm not doing it.

424
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:53,900
- No one asked you to.
- Not yet.

425
00:23:56,561 --> 00:24:00,613
- I'm hungry. Let's get something.
- Whoa, check out the group.

426
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:05,516
- There might be loaves and fishes.
- I had fish last night.

427
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:10,851
Do not heed the naysayers. They will not lead you down the proper road.

428
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:14,323
Hey, Rory. Dig the sounds coming from that garage.

429
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,606
- They sound amazing.
- I was over there before.

430
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:20,806
- That new guitarist - yum yum, like a long-haired cake.
- Sounds like a winner.

431
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:23,006
- You gonna check him out?
- Yeah, Lane called and asked me to come down

432
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:27,105
- and drink in the whole picture.
- I got dibs on the new hunk. Rrrr!

433
00:24:58,802 --> 00:25:01,000
Really tight, guys, but it's getting late. I gotta go.

434
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,850
- Go rest.
- Hey, Gil, this is my friend Rory. It's her house.

435
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,801
- Hey, you guys sound great.
- Don't you think?

436
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:11,904
- These guys are gonna be as good as Pink Floyd.
- Nice topical reference.

437
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:14,852
- Lane, you got my number?
- Yeah, Gil, I've got your number.

438
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:17,145
- Great. So, we'll talk later?
- We'll talk later.

439
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:18,307
Take it easy.

440
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,171
Bye.

441
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,555
Okay, Zach, shut up for a minute. I want to hear what Rory has to say.

442
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:29,992
I didn't tell her what she was walking into, so she's our fresh eyes here.

443
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:32,199
- He's great.
- And...

444
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:36,923
Experienced. And... Babette thinks he's really cute,

445
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:41,026
so she's got dibs, and... he moves great. The jump was cool.

446
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:43,924
- I was afraid he was gonna break a hip.
- Well, he's our only prospect.

447
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,914
And maybe that schoolboy outfit's worth a shot.

448
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:48,321
Look, you're all fooling yourselves here.

449
00:25:48,404 --> 00:25:52,515
Bottom line - dude rocks, but dude's too old. I vote "no."

450
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:56,161
- Okay, I guess that's that, then.
- That's that.

451
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:58,644
- And that could be that for the band.
- That could be that, too.

452
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,586
Okay.

453
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:09,227
- Identify yourself!
- It's me!

454
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,931
- Who?
- Me!

455
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:13,282
- Sookie?
- It's not coming out!

456
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,058
My God, it's one in the morning.

457
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:20,352
It's lodged in there! It's stuck, for God's sake! It's not coming out!

458
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:23,235
- You're insane.
- And it's growing all the time,

459
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:26,979
just getting bigger and bigger. I've forgotten what it's like not to be expanding.

460
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:30,531
I'll get so huge, I'll be the fat guy in "Monty Python's Meaning of Life."

461
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:33,911
I'll explode and slime the whole room. People could die.

462
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:37,013
- Honey, sit down, wrap this around you.
- Ooh! That Andrew.

463
00:26:37,116 --> 00:26:39,850
- I hate that he was right, that pasty-faced bastard!
- Right about what?

464
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:43,921
- Oh, no, I can't sit.
- Right about what?

465
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,228
I looked up an elephant's gestation period - 22 months!

466
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,368
- You're not an elephant.
- But Baby doesn't know that.

467
00:26:49,481 --> 00:26:52,537
- Why would Baby think you're an elephant?
- Because he's tiny and stupid

468
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:57,120
and floating around in a sack of fluid. He doesn't know his butt from a hole in the ground.

469
00:26:57,192 --> 00:27:00,796
- What happened?
- You know, an elephant squirted me once at the zoo.

470
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:04,073
Maybe it shot something on me - some kind of elephant-gestation juice.

471
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:06,915
Honey, I mean tonight. What happened? You were fine when I left you.

472
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:10,596
- Where did the freak-out come from?
- Are you listening? It's not coming out!

473
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:14,829
- The ship's too big and the bottle's too small!
- You have to sit down and rest.

474
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:18,446
For two hours, I've been doing everything I can to make it come out.

475
00:27:18,532 --> 00:27:23,106
- I mean, I've jumped, jiggled, shimmied.
- Add a feather boa and I could book you on the burlesque circuit.

476
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,008
- My pain is funny to you.
- No, but you should not be hopscotching

477
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:28,403
all around town trying to get the baby out. That's not how it works.

478
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,160
This is my mother's fault. She fed me too much roughage as a kid. Bran and granola and rapini.

479
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:38,510
And now my insides are all rough and grabby, and Davey can't work his way out of my sandpaper innards.

480
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:45,580
I want booze. I want a Manhattan and a scotch and a beer and a Rob Roy and a sidecar.

481
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:50,451
But I can't, and I'm mad about that. I want to give birth!

482
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:53,271
I would give you a hug if you would sit still for one second.

483
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:55,657
- Yours came out. How'd you get yours out?
- I swallowed a map.

484
00:27:55,729 --> 00:28:00,787
Cut the freaking vagueness. Why is it you mothers don't want to pass down your wisdom to other mothers?

485
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:02,927
- You're selfish.
- Please, stop jiggling.

486
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:06,831
- Not 'til I'm skinny.
- All right, bouncy San Pedro, can I just show you something here?

487
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:09,896
You can show me your sweet tokus as long as I can keep jiggling.

488
00:28:09,976 --> 00:28:13,748
Fine, keep jiggling. I was just going through something,

489
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:16,527
I thought you might be interested. It's from 1984.

490
00:28:16,587 --> 00:28:18,908
- The book?
- No, the year.

491
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:25,215
It's my baby box. It's full of all these little things, mementos and stuff from the night Rory was born.

492
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:29,691
- I haven't taken it out in ages.
- Mine's not getting a box because mine's not coming out.

493
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:34,851
My walkman with the homemade compilation tape still in it. "99 Luft Balloons,"

494
00:28:34,928 --> 00:28:37,181
- some R.E.M., some Thompson Twins.
- I never cared for them.

495
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:40,181
The magazine I was reading that night,

496
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,011
with a special feature on who's hotter - Andrew McCarthy or Emilio Estevez.

497
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:48,997
- They're both dogs.
- My Bubblicious-gum necklace, my Chunky wrapper.

498
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,859
Oh, I do like the Chunky's. I'd like bourbon better, but I do like the Chunky's.

499
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:54,722
- John's digits.
- John who?

500
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:56,847
He was volunteering at the hospital for high school credit.

501
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,964
- He said, "Call me when you get your figure back."
- Sweet-talker.

502
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,572
And for me, it was always Emilio 'cause he was kind of nasty.

503
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:06,826
Same here.

504
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,614
- Rory's first jumper.
- Bananarama?

505
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,816
I made it out of one of my t-shirts. It was the first thing I ever made her - ever made, ever.

506
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:18,690
It was post-Gilmore economy. Look how tiny.

507
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:21,931
- Tiny.
- She was the most beautiful pink all over.

508
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:28,275
She even smelled pink. That sounds weird. I can't describe it - that little, pink, baby smell.

509
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:35,694
The first time her eyes focused on me and her little fingers reached out...

510
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:38,826
I was someone new. She had me.

511
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:41,909
- Emilio.
- Rory.

512
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,647
We're five minutes away from the starting gate, people. Five minutes.

513
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:05,804
Oh, my God, you guys look so cute. You know, it was just seven short years ago

514
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:08,554
- that I was a little Chinese acrobat just like you.
- You smell!

515
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:12,056
And we respected our elders when I was a little Chinese acrobat.

516
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:15,547
- I hate kids.
- Lookin' good, lookin' good.

517
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,497
Hey everybody, big night, huh?

518
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:21,312
- Anyone sitting here?
- Yes. You have to go somewhere else.

519
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:23,708
- But Miss Patty said I...
- You have to go somewhere else!

520
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:29,729
Perhaps there's an empty chair next to one of your friends, say, the high priest Caiaphas?

521
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:33,037
- Maybe he can accommodate you, hm?
- I guess so.

522
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:37,578
Hey, Rory, one of those little acrobat boys told me my breath smells stinky.

523
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,621
- They're running wild.
- Acro-brats, I call them.

524
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:40,882
- Ha, nice!
- Thank you.

525
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,838
- Got your ferret.
- Oh, he looks mean.

526
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:46,503
I don't think there's any such thing as a friendly ferret and definitely not a cute one.

527
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,075
Yeah, they got dealt a rough card, those ferrets.

528
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:51,162
Oh, hey, art nouveau clock girl, hands off the face.

529
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,407
What? Art nouveau clock girl touched her face? This place is bedlam.

530
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,755
Oh, relax, Taylor. We're right on schedule. Have a cigarette.

531
00:30:58,838 --> 00:31:01,520
- I don't smoke.
- Could you start?

532
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:04,772
Taylor, look, your cousin came to visit you backstage to say hello.

533
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:09,611
Oh, hello! What a pretty night it is for a festival! Do you have a mouse? I'm feeling a bit peckish.

534
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:12,457
- Put that down.
- Just trying to lighten the mood.

535
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:18,182
It's too late. That Hank from Woodbury is sitting front-row center just trying to psych me out.

536
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:22,333
- Everybody's ready, Taylor, really.
- I hope everybody is ready.

537
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:24,422
Hey, let's all be friends. Can I nibble your neck?

538
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:28,012
- He's really got his knickers in a twist tonight.
- Hey, talk more like a ferret.

539
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,503
- Sorry, time to attach it.
- So, is Sookie okay?

540
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,672
Oh, she's great. Still big, still waiting, but she's fine.

541
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:35,595
Oh, good.

542
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:38,594
Was she the one shaking me in the middle of the night yelling,

543
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:40,770
"what motivated you to come out of your mother" over and over?

544
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:43,295
She got a little spooked. There.

545
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:46,485
- Wow. You're beautiful, Anthea.
- I feel very painty.

546
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:49,475
- I gotta go change. Freeze good.
- I will.

547
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,542
The time approaches. I am ready.

548
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:55,660
You might want to check that Gumby/Pokey watch, Kirk.

549
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,896
Right. Sorry. And it's a collectible, not a toy.

550
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:01,221
It's an adult... it's very valuable.

551
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:09,785
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Taylor Doose.

552
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:15,808
Welcome to the 43rd annual Connecticut Festival of Living Pictures.

553
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,379
As you may know, the town of Woodbury was supposed to host this year's festival,

554
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:27,746
but due to their recent flooding, Woodbury backed out.

555
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:34,178
They got a little moisture over there and basically said, "Oh, well, whatever, never mind."

556
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:38,297
But the town of Stars Hollow was happy to step in

557
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:42,555
because this vital tradition must continue.

558
00:32:44,403 --> 00:32:48,131
"The Festival of Living Pictures" has a storied history...

559
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:51,377
Cecilia - that's a very pretty name. Very pretty.

560
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:53,158
Keep it in your pants, Andrew.

561
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:57,270
Okay, listen up, people. The fire department is out here

562
00:32:57,356 --> 00:33:02,327
because some dingbat parked in the red zone. Now, I warned you guys about parking there.

563
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:07,454
So, who is it? Come on, speak up or you're gonna be towed. Who is it?

564
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,957
I saw it when I came in, I think that's Kirk's.

565
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:13,371
- You Judas!
- Go move it, Kirk!

566
00:33:13,515 --> 00:33:16,914
- Just trying to help.
- Shouldn't you kiss me on the cheek before you betray me?

567
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:19,075
- You're gonna get towed.
- Just keep away from me, pal!

568
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,477
You know, I'm getting a little tired of this holier-than-thou attitude of yours.

569
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:24,349
- I mean it.
- Rory, go, go, you're on.

570
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:27,764
Hey, art nouveau clock girl, you got your Zippo on you?

571
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:33,064
Our first tableau was created by the talented craftsmen in our little town.

572
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:38,537
It is a painting by the Italian master Girolamo Parmigianino.

573
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:44,992
He was born in Parma and was of the mannerist school, becoming a master portraitist,

574
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:50,093
blending the sensual style with the classical style of Raphael,

575
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:56,622
as you can see in his "Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea."

576
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:14,864
Five minutes to "The Last Supper", people, five minutes.

577
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:21,662
Oh, my God! Christ, Judas, stop fighting!

578
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:25,176
Shame you apostles, why couldn't you get in there and stop 'em?

579
00:34:28,642 --> 00:34:32,339
If I've re-pulled my calf muscle, you are so getting it!

580
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:35,159
So perform a miracle and unpull it, you jerk!

581
00:34:35,268 --> 00:34:38,186
You're a blasphemer! You're a blasphemer and a traitor!

582
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,329
- And let's face it, you're unattractive.
- Okay, we got no time for this.

583
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:46,869
Get your butts on that stage! And, apostles, keep Christ and Judas apart!

584
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:53,654
Da vinci's "Last Supper" has become one of the most revered masterpieces in the world.

585
00:34:53,776 --> 00:35:02,229
This majestic fresco was completed in 1498 and its prestige has never diminished.

586
00:35:02,332 --> 00:35:05,669
You've been a jerk from the start! What about Shakey's?

587
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:07,963
- You all went out without me, and you lied about it.
- You're imagining things.

588
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:12,894
Well, Simon Peter said so. James, the son of Alpheus, Lebbeus - they all said so.

589
00:35:12,966 --> 00:35:16,662
- When did you speak with Lebbeus?
- God help me, if you two don't shut up,

590
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:22,136
I'm gonna stick these papier-mch� rolls down your throats! That's it! That's it! Curtain!

591
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:27,522
And so now may we present "The Last Supper."

592
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:50,992
So I was good? The ferret didn't upstage me?

593
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:52,616
The ferret underplayed it nicely.

594
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:54,709
Hey, isn't that that guitarist?

595
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,624
It is. It's Gil. Rats, I was gonna call him tomorrow with the bad news.

596
00:35:59,753 --> 00:36:01,499
Well, you could just walk away rudely.

597
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:04,084
I'll say a quick hello and tell him I'll call him tomorrow.

598
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:08,801
Hey, Lane. Trippy, huh?

599
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:10,925
Totally. How you doin', Gil?

600
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:13,633
Great. I saw the flyers, I thought I'd come check it out.

601
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,501
Cool, great, yeah.

602
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:19,061
- Hey, don't sweat it, okay?
- What do you mean?

603
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:21,729
It's okay. I know I'm not in the band.

604
00:36:21,923 --> 00:36:27,625
I picked up the vibe. The age difference... it doesn't bother me, but it's a little weird, I know.

605
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:29,832
- Maybe a little.
- It's cool, really.

606
00:36:30,073 --> 00:36:34,241
Good. Well, you're a great guy, Gil, and a great guitarist.

607
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,510
- Someone's gonna scoop you up quick.
- I hope so.

608
00:36:36,642 --> 00:36:39,844
- I'm gonna keep going no matter what, not like last time.
- Last time?

609
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:44,656
Yeah. I had another band, a great band, the hottest band in L.A.

610
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:49,632
We sold out all the clubs - The House of Blues, The Whiskey. A&R guys were hanging out.

611
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:52,765
We had an awesome demo with tunes. Then we got our big break -

612
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:56,380
an opening slot on a national tour with Quiet Riot.

613
00:36:56,933 --> 00:37:01,341
But we blew it. We were fighting all the time over money, over chicks.

614
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,046
- We broke up before the tour even started.
- Oh no.

615
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:09,237
It killed me. I didn't touch my Axe for years. I just got a day gig and lived my life.

616
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:13,414
Then a few months ago, I picked up my guitar, and I realized how much I missed it.

617
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:15,631
So I went out looking again, and that's how you got my tape.

618
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,755
But I'm not stopping this time for anything.

619
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:20,973
I'm gonna keep going until it happens.

620
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:25,842
But thanks for letting me play with you guys. It was a blast. You're fantastic.

621
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:31,637
Well, get used to playing with us, Gil, 'cause you're in the band.

622
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:33,122
- Really?
- Really.

623
00:37:33,296 --> 00:37:34,883
- No way!
- Way.

624
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:38,253
Oh, my God! This is so cool! I can't believe it.

625
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:41,135
- I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

626
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:44,559
Honey, kids, I am in the band!

627
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:50,306
- Our guitarist is married.
- You made his kids happy, too.

628
00:37:56,695 --> 00:37:59,479
You guys watched the first two "Matrix"s on DVD together, too.

629
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:01,906
- I heard all about it.
- Get away from me.

630
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:06,750
"The Last Supper," ladies and gentlemen. Serene, wasn't it?

631
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:11,850
Better order quick. We're closing...

632
00:38:13,744 --> 00:38:16,073
- Soon.
- Surprise.

633
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:17,109
I'll say.

634
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:22,756
- Lots of nuttiness going on out there.
- Yeah, it's the festival of nutty pictures, so...

635
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:27,681
- You successfully avoid the nuttiness?
- Yeah, for the most part, yeah.

636
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:31,507
Christ's table was broken, so I fixed it.

637
00:38:31,788 --> 00:38:34,353
- He's a carpenter, he should have fixed it himself.
- Yeah, well...

638
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:39,098
Speaking of nutty... all this, you and me.

639
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:44,126
- If it were happening to anyone else, I'd laugh.
- About what?

640
00:38:44,275 --> 00:38:48,439
Well, getting married is what broke us up. You gotta love the irony.

641
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,742
Yeah, it is a little ironic.

642
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:55,924
Luke, I'm not gonna say that getting married on that ship like we did wasn't wrong.

643
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,606
We should have thought more about it, but...

644
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:02,195
maybe rushing into divorce would be just as wrong.

645
00:39:02,534 --> 00:39:04,724
- What are you talking about?
- Well, we're still you and me.

646
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,821
- Why can't we have what we had before?
- Which was?

647
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:12,314
- Two people who loved being together.
- We're in the middle of a divorce.

648
00:39:12,446 --> 00:39:14,744
- We can postpone it.
- We can?

649
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,352
I'm a lawyer, I know these things.

650
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:19,778
- Postpone it and do what?
- Date.

651
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:22,471
- Date?
- Remember? That was the fun part.

652
00:39:23,371 --> 00:39:26,567
So what you're saying is we get back together,

653
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,395
- not divorced, but not be married, either?
- I guess.

654
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:37,385
I know it sounds stupid, but it doesn't feel stupid, does it?

655
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:45,593
Picasso's "Guernica," everybody. Wasn't that something?

656
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:53,288
Our next work is found in the gardens of Versailles in the country of our former ally, France.

657
00:39:53,401 --> 00:39:59,603
It is one of more than two thousand sculptures to be found in that famed garden.

658
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:06,381
I'd like to turn your attention now to our town's beloved gazebo for "The Reaper."

659
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:21,675
Okay, our statue's done. Stamp it, ship it.

660
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:25,718
Terrence and Lorelai, our Renoir couple, you're up next. Be ready.

661
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:28,023
Okay, I'm just about done here, Patty. Just give me one second.

662
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:31,950
Okay, I'm just saying, two-minute warning. Terrence, get into place.

663
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:34,055
My aching feet will never forgive me.

664
00:40:34,863 --> 00:40:37,106
- You ready for your close-up, Miss Desmond?
- Just about.

665
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,123
Grand finale. It's a great way to close this thing.

666
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,294
You know, I don't know why everybody's rushing me like this.

667
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,791
- Mom... you okay?
- Yeah.

668
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:47,264
- No.
- No?

669
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,801
My heart is going a million miles a second. I feel hot. Is my makeup running?

670
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,368
No, Mom, you look great. What's wrong?

671
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:55,461
- I flinched.
- What?

672
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:58,635
Seven years ago on this very stage in this very costume, I flinched.

673
00:40:58,743 --> 00:41:00,437
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

674
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:05,834
You weren't watching. I was in denial. I just didn't want Taylor to be right, but he was. I flinched.

675
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:09,249
Well, so what? You flinched a little. I bet most people didn't see it.

676
00:41:09,337 --> 00:41:11,497
Stevie Wonder could have seen it. I almost knocked Terrence down.

677
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,112
- I flinched. I am a big, fat flincher!
- But that was a long time ago.

678
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:17,579
- Once a flincher, always a flincher.
- No, no, Mom.

679
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:22,055
- That was seven years ago. You're different now.
- Yeah, I am. I'm less stable.

680
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:25,455
My muscles are weaker and my bones are more fragile.

681
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:30,072
There are a dozen more ways for me to wobble now. I'm a Weeble, and Weebles wobble.

682
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,294
- I'm gonna blow the whole finale and the town is gonna hate me.
- Mom, listen.

683
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:37,312
You are in amazing physical shape. This is mental. You can beat it.

684
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,786
How?

685
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,456
'Cause you can.

686
00:41:41,408 --> 00:41:43,543
- No specifics?
- Not really.

687
00:41:44,123 --> 00:41:45,585
I need something.

688
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:49,478
- Close your eyes and think of England.
- Okay.

689
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:54,336
And know that I love you no matter what happens up there and go be still.

690
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,098
- England, England.
- England.

691
00:41:58,151 --> 00:42:01,883
She's not gonna flinch, is she? Is she?

692
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:07,367
... made Pierre Auguste Renoir one of the world's most beloved painters.

693
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:17,019
So to close our triumphant evening, we give you his incomparable "Dance at Bougival."

694
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,384
Good girl. Keep it up.

695
00:42:35,784 --> 00:42:40,268
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

696
00:42:40,387 --> 00:42:42,567
- What the hell is that?
- It's Sookie's baby pager.

697
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,805
Oy to the vey!

698
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,050
- I can't look.
- Keep frozen. Keep frozen.

699
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:53,187
What's happening?

700
00:42:59,336 --> 00:43:01,957
That's it. Curtain!

701
00:43:12,534 --> 00:43:18,561
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for making tonight such a success.

702
00:43:18,977 --> 00:43:22,355
On behalf of the town of Stars Hollow,

703
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:27,997
we bid you adieu from "The Festival of Living Pictures."

704
