1
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,259
Don't.

2
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:28,711
- You okay? 
- Well, you hurt my feelings just now.

3
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:30,681
No, I mean you doing okay with everything?

4
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:32,944
You're referring to my meltdown in the park.

5
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:35,166
- It wasn't a meltdown. 
- Oh, it was a meltdown.

6
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:37,481
They're making it into a movie -- "Meltdown in the Park."

7
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,897
Don't worry, it's just a working title. Baz Luhrmann's directing.

8
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:42,867
- And the movie Luke wears tights and sings. 
- But you're okay?

9
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:45,243
- Thanks to my knight in shining armor. 
- Ah, well�

10
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,120
I just hope Alec Baldwin captures your rare essence.

11
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:51,054
And slims down a little for the role. I should deliver these.

12
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:53,814
- Can I work on my laptop? 
- Does it make noise?

13
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,635
- No, but I sometimes do. 
- You always do.

14
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:01,924
- Kirk. 
- Luke.

15
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,338
- What's with the... 
- It's not a purse!

16
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,503
- I wasn't gonna say "purse." 
- Oh� Sorry.

17
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:07,761
- What's with the gay bag? 
- It's a dog carrier.

18
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:12,333
My girlfriend's gone out of town with some friends, and I'm watching Buster for her.

19
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,340
And they're girlfriends, not guys.

20
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:18,062
I called the hotel she booked and verified that it's a girl's name on the register with her.

21
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:20,494
- Not that I don't trust her. 
- Clearly.

22
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,004
- Over there okay? 
- Sure.

23
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:26,402
Carol, Danny, Jamie, Sean, Chris?

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,233
What's that?

25
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:29,879
Just a list of guys' names that could be girls. You want coffee?

26
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,444
- What is this? 
- Phone cord.

27
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,298
- I can't have this here. 
- Don't worry.

28
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:38,972
It's not plugged in to your regular line.

29
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:41,824
It's the fax line you put in a year ago that you never use.

30
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:44,666
You mean the fax line you made me put in to get in fax orders,

31
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:47,917
even though no one has ever wanted to put in a fax order,

32
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:50,498
and I never got the fax machine, like I told you I would never, ever 

33
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:54,215
get the fax machine, making the fax line pointless.

34
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,036
Hold on� Let me get on the "Guinness World Records" website.

35
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,618
Yes, that's the most times anyone has ever used the word "fax" in a sentence.

36
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:04,194
- Just be quick with this. 
- Man, I love e-mail.

37
00:03:04,372 --> 00:03:06,968
Every day Rory and I write each other multiple times. It's great.

38
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,288
You enjoy typing to people more than talking to them?

39
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:12,411
Wrong perspective. E-mail is a return to the romantic days of letter writing.

40
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,674
- It's pure Dickens. 
- Why Dickens?

41
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,319
It's just when I picture letter writing, I picture Charles Dickens.

42
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:20,875
Charles Dickens wrote more letters than other people?

43
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:24,893
No, it's just I can easily picture him in his study with his dog

44
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,981
and his pipe and his fancy feathered pen, writing

45
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:31,986
"Cheerio, old bean. Have a cup of tea. How's Big Ben?

46
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:36,251
How's the Tower of London, Sister Suffragette? Tuppence a bag."

47
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:37,455
Sounds like an idiot.

48
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:40,977
- Hey, Luke, coffee? 
- Oh, this is embarrassing.

49
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:43,869
I could unplug, but then I'd just have to start the whole process all over again.

50
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:46,250
Or you could just eat here and save e-mailing for when you're...

51
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:50,555
Excuse me.

52
00:03:56,073 --> 00:03:58,389
- You have a dog there? 
- No. Why?

53
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:00,172
Just putting two and two together.

54
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:03,336
Well, it's coming out five. Buster is at home, asleep.

55
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,413
Okay. What'll you have?

56
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:11,293
Oatmeal, extra brown sugar on the side, and a pound of raw hamburger.

57
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:14,108
Or just the oatmeal will be fine.

58
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:21,353
- Voila! 
- This does nothing.

59
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:25,235
- It makes it easier to limbo under. 
- This is my place. I shouldn't have to limbo.

60
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:27,093
You still sleepy?

61
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:31,143
- Why is Kirk talking to his man purse? 
- You got sleepy face. You have to tinkle?

62
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:40,154
Where is that? Just looking for my Lucky magazine, and...

63
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,594
Paper cut.

64
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:49,393
- What are you doing? 
- Getting a drink.

65
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,902
- You're sick. 
- Hence the fluids.

66
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,783
When you came out of our room, did you use the doorknob?

67
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:55,798
As opposed to dematerializing, passing vapor-like through the wall,

68
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,024
then rematerializing out here? No, I used the doorknob.

69
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:00,626
For the love of God, I begged you not to touch anything.

70
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,279
I'm not contagious anymore.

71
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,725
- Paris, stop! 
- I'm not getting sick.

72
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,486
That's your deodorant.

73
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:09,391
Then what the hell did I spray under my arms?

74
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,312
That's mine.

75
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,740
- Hello. 
- Guess where I'm standing.

76
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,532
I don't know but you sound a little echoey.

77
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:20,297
I'm standing in the living room of my very own apartment!

78
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,263
- You're kidding. 
- I'm waiting for the gas man.

79
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,686
The gas man! Isn't that great?

80
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:26,564
I've got gas! Ignore the word. Just focus on the enthusiasm.

81
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,554
- How are you affording this? 
- I'm sharing it with Zack and Brian.

82
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:32,048
- You're living with the band? 
- It's totally innocent,

83
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:34,168
I have my own room, and they're gonna sleep in the living room.

84
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:36,861
That is so cool. When do you move your stuff in?

85
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:40,695
Tomorrow. That is if my mom hasn't sold it all by now. Hey, you sound a little stuffed.

86
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:44,536
I've been sick, but it's mostly deodorant stench I'm suffering from at the moment.

87
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:48,648
Oh, my God! My first mail is here! It's a Chinese menu.

88
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:51,468
- Frame it or something. 
- I will. I've gotta go, I'll call you later.

89
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,329
- Oh, that's not dangerous. 
- Fire kills germs.

90
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:58,850
- And I'm sleeping with one of the other girls tonight. 
- How very "The L Word".

91
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,277
You done?

92
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:08,610
Oh yes, your limboing days are over, my friend. Thanks for putting up with me.

93
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,771
- Well, I only fell once. 
- And gracefully. Bye.

94
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:12,367
- Wait a minute. Hold on. 
- Why?

95
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:18,102
- You're making me nervous. 
- Just... here.

96
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,964
- What's this? 
- It's what it is.

97
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,437
- "A monk, a trunk, and a skunk." 
- What are you doing?

98
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:25,947
Carnak, although I don't have a punch line. Never stopped Johnny.

99
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:28,005
- Put that down. Hide it. 
- What is it?

100
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:29,664
Open it later.

101
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,400
A check to me for $30,000.

102
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,272
Luke, this is the money I was gonna ask you for.

103
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,897
- And you did ask, and there it is. 
- But I didn't. Not officially.

104
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:48,884
I blubbered an amount to you, and we didn't get to talk about a repayment schedule.

105
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:50,704
- It's okay. 
- Or interest or collateral.

106
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:54,107
I had charts and projections. I wanted to take you out to a nice dinner.

107
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:55,572
So send me a Honeybaked Ham.

108
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:58,296
But this is wrong. This is not how you do these things.

109
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,066
I don't know how to do these things. Will you just take the money?

110
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,569
I'm sorry, we at least have to go over the basics.

111
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,032
I don't want to read that.

112
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:08,731
Well, I'm not leaving until you read this napkin.

113
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:14,107
Fine. Okay? That's okay. That's too much.

114
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,498
- That's sufficient. 
- Okay, but what about this?

115
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,976
- Nicole?! 
- Hey! I thought we were writing and sliding.

116
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:22,913
What about Nicole?

117
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:25,478
- I need to know her role. 
- There is none.

118
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:28,283
Luke, if it's joint money, then I should acknowledge that

119
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:30,266
- and thank her the next time I see her� 
- You're not gonna see her.

120
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:31,981
Now, can we stop talking about this whole thing?

121
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:36,817
Okay, but I insist on typing up something legal and binding for this loan.

122
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,989
Okay. I really just don't want to talk about this anymore.

123
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:45,549
- We'll dot the Is and cross the Ts another day. 
- Yes, we'll cross and dot.

124
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:48,933
- I just have to write down one more thing. 
- What! What is so important now?

125
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:53,936
You're welcome.

126
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:05,579
Gilmore -- Richard and Emily Gilmore.

127
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,897
Look, we single-handedly put your restaurant on the map

128
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:12,623
by praising your crab puffs at Eunice Pierpont Pennington's granddaughter's christening.

129
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:13,514
Hi, Mom.

130
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:17,139
Oh, really? You're new there? Because your deft handling of this phone call

131
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,761
displays all the signs of a seasoned and experienced hand.

132
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,298
Yes, go get Trey. That's a smashing idea.

133
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:25,420
- Painful hello. 
- What's going on?

134
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:28,420
You couldn't see the smoke from Stars Hollow? Lettie burned the entr�e.

135
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:30,466
Beyond edibility? 'Cause I'm not picky.

136
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,662
No, I could not expose you to such a loin.

137
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,470
- Oh, if I had a nickel. 
- What?

138
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:35,705
So you had a burning loin.

139
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,566
And now I'm fighting to squeeze us into somewhere appropriate.

140
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:40,369
Someone to take pity on the loinless.

141
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,678
- Is that how you're dressed? 
- Is this a trick question?

142
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:46,001
-  It's really not appropriate to go out in. 
- Well, I did not foresee your burning loin.

143
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,479
- Stop saying that word. 
- When will I get this chance again?

144
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:51,346
I've seen that on you a dozen times. You really should update your wardrobe.

145
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,811
My wardrobe is fine, Mom.

146
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:54,977
The summer lines are coming out. You should hit a store.

147
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:56,820
No need for you to hit any more stores, Emily.

148
00:09:56,907 --> 00:10:00,209
You've done enough shopping for a lifetime. For Methuselah's lifetime.

149
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:01,895
- Hello, Lorelai. 
- Hi, Dad.

150
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:06,241
- I didn't say I was going shopping, Richard. 
- It's an instinct that requires no verbalization.

151
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:09,293
I was suggesting that your daughter update her wardrobe.

152
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:12,011
- No need to spread your disease either. 
- Richard!

153
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,917
Really Dad, don't read more into this than what it is: just humiliating me.

154
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:18,623
I should hang up and let you both starve.

155
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,602
What do you mean, starve? What happened to dinner?

156
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:23,132
I told you not five minutes ago that dinner was ruined.

157
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,254
- Did you? 
- Yes.

158
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:27,299
I heard the word "loin," but I didn't think you meant dinner.

159
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:28,851
This is making me very uncomfortable.

160
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:30,710
That's because you half listen to everything I say.

161
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:34,099
Yes, I'm still here. Good, check with him.

162
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:35,932
I think we have a shot at Bastide.

163
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,421
- Isn't that a little drab? 
- We love Bastide.

164
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,131
You love Bastide. Why don't we try that place Jason took me to last week?

165
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:46,372
A lot of hip clientele. He pointed out Moby to me. He's that bald musician.

166
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,998
- Yep, that's pretty hip, Dad. 
- When did you have dinner with Moby?

167
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:52,890
Moby was just there. Jason played me some of his music later. I liked it.

168
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:55,276
We're going to Bastide, but don't fret.

169
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,851
Maybe the Beatles will be there and you can sit in and jam with them.

170
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:01,271
- Two of the Beatles are dead, Emily. 
- Only one is dead.

171
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:04,762
No, a second Beatle died just recently. Lorelai?

172
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:06,821
Could you press the "pause" button on this conversation?

173
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,988
I really want Rory to hear the rest of it.

174
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,357
If we're going to Bastide, you should change your jacket, Richard.

175
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:12,795
All right.

176
00:11:13,262 --> 00:11:15,629
And please shave that moustache, I beg of you.

177
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:18,827
I want to see what it looks like fully grown, Emily. That was the agreement.

178
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:22,477
Well, it looks like a caterpillar now. In two weeks it'll look like a bigger caterpillar.

179
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:24,798
- Very funny. 
- I'm not trying to be funny.

180
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,014
I will shave it when I shave it.

181
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:31,643
Yes. Yes, we'll be there. Thank you. Wait! They said they can take us

182
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,413
if we can be there in five minutes and order as quickly as possible.

183
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:36,703
- Well it'll take longer than that. 
- Not if we move.

184
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,458
- What about my jacket? 
- Doesn't matter.

185
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,460
- They'll be staring at your moustache. 
- Emily.

186
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:42,395
Come on. Scoot, scoot. And be thinking about what you want.

187
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:45,002
Whoa, just one little problem here. Rory?

188
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,516
- What about her? 
- She's not here yet.

189
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,011
- She's not coming. 
- She's not coming?

190
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,874
No, she's been sick all week. I told her to stay in her dorm and rest.

191
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,681
- She's been sick? 
- Didn't you know?

192
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,161
Oh, yeah, I knew.

193
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:55,994
I'm having sea bass. Think, think.

194
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,410
I knew it.

195
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:12,670
- Hello? 
- We have an e-mail relationship.

196
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:16,971
- She speaks. She has the ability. 
- What's wrong?

197
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:18,599
Are you okay? Are you sick?

198
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:20,212
I'm getting over a cold. You knew that.

199
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:23,545
No, I didn't, because our once-wonderful relationship,

200
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,863
envy of all the world, more intimate than that of the naked couple

201
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:30,581
in the "love is..." cartoons, has degenerated into e-mail correspondence.

202
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:33,039
- I'm sure I wrote that I had a cold. 
- No, you didn't.

203
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,918
In all those e-mails, I didn't mention it?

204
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:38,431
All those e-mails? I'm sorry, but you write less than the people

205
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:40,641
offering to enlarge a piece of anatomy I do not possess.

206
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:41,767
I could have sworn I told you.

207
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:44,829
I just reread every e-mail you sent in the past ten days. No sickness mention,

208
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:49,904
but you did share these gems: "Hey, what up? Is it freezing there, too? Ice."

209
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:54,117
And, "Whew. Pooped." Then you added one of those obnoxious hieroglyphics

210
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:56,093
that I can never read that are supposed to indicate you're laughing

211
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,213
or smiling or frowning or vomiting. I don't know what.

212
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:00,296
That's a typo. I don't do cutesy symbols.

213
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:04,954
You're not even using verbs. That's not a relationship. Relationships need verbs.

214
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:07,179
- Well yours aren't much better. 
- I'm not saying they are.

215
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,393
- I can never get you on the phone. 
- I can never get you!

216
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:12,170
- You got me now. 
- Freak of nature.

217
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:13,614
What do you look like. Do you look the same?

218
00:13:13,738 --> 00:13:15,877
- Hold on. My nose ring is itching. 
- Don't kid.

219
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,958
I'm mad and needy, and I ended up going out to dinner alone with my parents,

220
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,014
who bickered the whole time about which Beatle is alive and which is dead.

221
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:25,836
- So, where'd they land? 
- John and Keith are dead.

222
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:29,118
Paul and Bingo are still kicking. Play hooky tomorrow.

223
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:30,951
- From what? 
- I don't know.

224
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:34,351
Whatever you got. I know you're always busy, but let's do something.

225
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:36,793
- What about the inn? 
- They can live without me for a day.

226
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,306
- Tomorrow's actually good. 
- Really?

227
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,407
There's a newspaper thing, but I can skip that.

228
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,459
- Cool! What do we do? 
- I don't know.

229
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,774
Mom said the summer clothing lines are out.

230
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,985
Want to go shopping? We haven't done that in ages.

231
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:50,422
- But we're both totally skint. 
- Huh? We're what?

232
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,184
We're skint -- broke. It's British.

233
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:55,230
Oh man, you've learned to speak British. I didn't even know about it.

234
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:56,264
You know what I mean.

235
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,609
So we won't buy anything. We'll just window-shop.

236
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,236
- That could be fun. 
- It'll be like we're in an old movie, y'know?

237
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,691
Walking around, window-shopping like Roz Russell and Ava Gardner on Fifth Avenue.

238
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:08,071
- I'm with you. 
- Meet me at the inn, 10:00?

239
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,969
But it's been so long. How will we recognize each other?

240
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:14,196
- We'll wear a rose in our lapels. 
- Or dangling from my nose ring.

241
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:16,729
- You're kidding about that, right? 
- I'm leaving you in suspense.

242
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:19,627
- Tomorrow at 10:00, Roz darling? 
- Till tomorrow, Ava dearest.

243
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:29,385
Look out. Coming through.

244
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:31,415
What's with all the dogs, Kirk?

245
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:33,770
Well, people in town saw how good I was with Lulu's dog

246
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:36,519
that they asked me to watch theirs -- for a fee, of course.

247
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,377
- What are you looking for? 
- Shh. Come on.

248
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,755
It's a game I'm playing with the dogs -- tracker.

249
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:46,953
See, I cut one of them loose, and then the rest of us hide until we get tracked down.

250
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,232
- At the moment, we're hiding from Snuggles. 
- We are?

251
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:53,317
It helps them hone their tracking skills, and the kids love it.

252
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,775
- What kids? 
- The babies. The dogs.

253
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:59,426
- You ever the one that gets cut loose? 
- I've gone twice. Shh. Snuggles.

254
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,007
Cute, but not the smartest tool in the shed.

255
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,821
He found us! Celebrate!

256
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:13,762
Come on, Luke. Celebrate!

257
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:16,608
- I'll have a beer tonight. 
- Beer? Oh, no!

258
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:20,787
We don't like beer. Beer is bad. Cookies! Cookies!

259
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,749
- Hi, Rory. 
- Hi, Tom. How's it going?

260
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:33,551
- Not half bad. 
- Then it's half good.

261
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,797
- That makes it sound better than it is. 
- Kinda the point.

262
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:38,799
- What's with the flower? 
- It's so my Mom and I will recognize each other.

263
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:39,951
- Girl thing? 
- Yeah.

264
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,933
- I'm not into girl things. 
- You're a contractor.

265
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:42,891
Yep. Later.

266
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:46,992
Oh, excuse me. Can I have your autograph?

267
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:48,262
What?

268
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:50,524
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were one of the Village People.

269
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:53,631
- I'm kidding. I'm a kidder. 
- What are you doing here?

270
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,685
I'm meeting my mom here. We're playing hooky.

271
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,878
- The flower's a private joke for her? 
- You know me well.

272
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,686
Yeah, I do. So, you okay and all?

273
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:04,097
Yeah. Oh, that. I'm fine now.

274
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,255
A little nervous breakdown can really work wonders for a girl.

275
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:11,353
- I didn't mean to lay all that on you. 
- That's what shoulders are for.

276
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:13,830
You've got a heck of an understanding shoulder.

277
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:16,292
- Hey, you want to hammer something? 
- Always.

278
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:17,804
- Be my guest. 
- Really?

279
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,425
Yeah, Tom went outside. Do it. Go on.

280
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,098
I feel like I should spit or hike up my shorts or something.

281
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:28,730
You're a natural.

282
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:30,803
I think I must have been a carpenter in another life,

283
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:32,678
or just someone who really hated nails.

284
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:34,965
- Hi, Rory. 
- Oh, hi, Lindsay.

285
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:39,728
- Are we early? 
- No, not at all.

286
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:42,190
Mom and I just wanted to get a nice jump on things today.

287
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,084
Did Lindsay tell you we found a new dry cleaner?

288
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:45,457
- No. 
- Tell him, Lindsay!

289
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,648
They use less solvent, so it's cleaner.

290
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:51,177
- I'm really into the environment. 
- Oh, me too.

291
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:54,604
- So, are you working here? 
- No, that was illegal hammering.

292
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:57,479
Completely nonunion. Come the revolution, I shall be shot.

293
00:16:57,612 --> 00:16:59,374
Let's set up lunch before everything gets cold.

294
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:02,430
- Lunch? This early? 
- Our Deano's up at 5:00.

295
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:03,587
Deano?

296
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:07,048
Don't worry. Mom made lunch today, so it's safe to eat.

297
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,700
Lindsay's mom is teaching her how to cook.

298
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:13,981
- It's hard. Do you know how? 
- If you count radiator quesadillas.

299
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,958
I should have started teaching you sooner.

300
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:17,836
Don't make that mistake with your little one.

301
00:17:26,764 --> 00:17:29,700
You're never going to attract a man looking like that.

302
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:31,650
- Over here, biddy bidster. 
- Oh, bye.

303
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:35,209
- Hi. Oh, you wore a rose! 
- That was the agreement.

304
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,763
- Hey, Lindsay. Hey, Theresa. 
- Hi.

305
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:39,197
- You ready? 
- Let's go.

306
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:41,204
Hey, how often does this happen?

307
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:45,981
Oh, well, it's a hot lunch every day. Plus they always bring something for the group.

308
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,126
Yesterday it was peanut brittle Lindsay made.

309
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,710
It broke a crown, three teeth, then a HazMat team came and took it away.

310
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:00,710
They put everything on pretzels nowadays. I love that

311
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,083
- You're our new best friend, Howard. 
- We don't say that to just anybody.

312
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,531
Just anybody holding free food.

313
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,231
- We'll be back. 
- Stock up.

314
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,522
- Okay, here we go. 
- Where should we start?

315
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:11,910
Well, we're window-shopping, so let's find a window.

316
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:13,895
I see rows and rows of windows.

317
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:18,365
Hey, let's walk arm in arm like window-shopping ladies do in movies.

318
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:19,124
You got it.

319
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:20,992
I wish I'd brought a xylophone with me.

320
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:24,252
There's always a bouncy xylophone playing when movie girls window-shop.

321
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,479
- So, left or right? 
- Let's go right.

322
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:32,456
Oh, cool.

323
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,108
- Oh, that would look great on you. 
- I love blue.

324
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,087
You should make a mental note to get that when you're back in the cash.

325
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:38,814
Done.

326
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,806
- Shall we? 
- Let's shall.

327
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:42,424
Oh, sorry.

328
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:45,047
One of the risks of linked-arm walking.

329
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:58,455
- Lane. 
- Hello.

330
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,794
- Come in. 
- Thank you.

331
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:07,026
- Hello, Aunt Jun. 
- Hello.

332
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:09,836
Your Aunt Jun brought your cousin Christine to help with your move.

333
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:10,943
Say hello to Christine.

334
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,790
- Hello, Christine. 
- Hello, Lane.

335
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,168
Jun and I will remain down here while you move. You may use whatever boxes you need,

336
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,915
plus bubble wrap and tape. Just write down what you take for inventory purposes.

337
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,509
- I will. Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

338
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,460
Go with Lane, Christine.

339
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,177
I don't believe it! You're moving! What happened? Tell me everything!

340
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:39,583
Was there a fight? Are you getting married?

341
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:42,223
No female Kim has ever moved out without getting married.

342
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,486
You're not getting married, right?

343
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:47,234
I love the floorboard thing! It's so "Hogan's Heroes!"

344
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:50,291
I wonder if I can pull up the floorboards at my house. Have you heard of the Libertines?

345
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:52,512
What about the White Stripes? Is it over for them?

346
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,626
What about Zeppelin? I'm getting more retro. What's a good Zeppelin?

347
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:58,432
"II," "III"? "III"'s got "Stairway to Heaven," right?

348
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:01,253
Man, it's like a funeral down there. I thought my mom was harsh,

349
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:04,372
but your mom makes the guy from Joy Division look like one of the Teletubbies.

350
00:20:04,443 --> 00:20:07,585
Are you taking all of this? Is she going through the boxes before you leave?

351
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:10,345
Where do you buy the CDs with the swear words? Did you buy them in disguise?

352
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:12,072
Did someone buy them for you? Have you ever...

353
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:15,901
Hey Kid, do I look green and wrinkly to you? No? That's right. I'm not Yoda.

354
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:18,226
So if you're looking for a mentor, call the Dalai Lama.

355
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:22,731
What I'm here to do is get my stuff and split. Now be quiet and start assembling boxes.

356
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:26,007
And "Stairway to Heaven" is from "Led Zeppelin IV."

357
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:28,363
If you're going to get into classic rock, know it, don't blow it!

358
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:36,074
Do you have a car? Are you getting a car? Do you have a license?

359
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:38,260
Are Kims allowed to drive? I'm dying to drive.

360
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:42,322
I left the inventory list in the room.

361
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,890
- Very good. 
- I guess I'll be going.

362
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:49,647
Step away from Lane, Christine.

363
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:05,991
- Oh, that's nice. 
- Which?

364
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,588
- That. 
- The skirt and the blouse?

365
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,651
- Yeah. More the skirt than the blouse. 
- I like them both.

366
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:10,563
Good colors

367
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:13,154
- Oh, they have nice-looking jackets. 
- Where?

368
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:15,314
- In the back there. 
- Oh, cute.

369
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:18,299
- Mental note. 
- Absolutely. Next window?

370
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:19,844
Sure.

371
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:24,516
- Okay, this sucks. 
- Completely.

372
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:28,181
This is the least amount of fun I've ever had, barring the time we went to Mummenschanz.

373
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:31,291
- Oh, this is way less fun. 
- Window-shopping? What was I thinking?

374
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:33,364
But it sounds fun. It should be fun.

375
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:36,542
Not if you think about it. I mean, window-shopping is like going to a museum,

376
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,499
but you're actually interested in what you're looking at,

377
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,408
and everyone can buy something except for you.

378
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,444
I've made so many mental notes in my head of things to get

379
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,328
that I think my head has actually gotten bigger.

380
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:49,296
Look at all these haughty people with their bags,

381
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,994
just rubbing our faces in it. What were Roz Russell and Ava Gardner thinking?

382
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:55,124
What movie did you see them window-shop in?

383
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,933
I don't know that I did. I just picked two old movie-actress names.

384
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,575
I don't know that I've seen anyone window-shop in a movie ever.

385
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:03,806
So, this whole outing was a house of sand built on a foundation of straw.

386
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:07,846
Hey, maybe if we went in the store, it would be better.

387
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:11,169
Well, it would be way better than just pressing our noses up against the windows.

388
00:22:17,776 --> 00:22:18,751
Nope.

389
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:20,866
- Worse! 
- Much worse.

390
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:22,192
Time to pull the plug, hon.

391
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:24,216
But what do we do? It's still morning.

392
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:25,813
We could ride the glass elevator up and down.

393
00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:26,958
Oh, God, we're sad.

394
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:28,716
They've got a merry-go-round.

395
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:31,500
- It costs money. 
- Right, and we're skint.

396
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:35,044
Plus dirty diapers have touched those seats.

397
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,592
Well, let's just go somewhere where things are not for sale.

398
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,844
- Let's be rid of temptation. 
- Sounds good.

399
00:22:43,313 --> 00:22:46,087
- Do you see Howard? 
- I see Howard, and he's got a fresh batch.

400
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,567
I'm looking forward to Howard.

401
00:22:50,123 --> 00:22:51,540
- Oh, no. 
- What?

402
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:53,296
- Emily. 
- Emily who?

403
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:56,575
"Emily the Strange" with the black cat and the boots made for kicking. Who do you think?

404
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,263
- Grandma's here? Are you sure? 
- Very sure.

405
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,010
- Why are we hiding? 
- Reflex.

406
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,839
- We have to say hello to her. 
- Why? We're two ships. We're passing.

407
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:04,950
If she sees us hiding, we're going to have to explain.

408
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:05,774
So hide good.

409
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:07,198
Lorelai, Rory!

410
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:09,512
- Mom, hi. 
- Hi, Grandma.

411
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,806
- Meet me up here. 
- Oh, we're going down.

412
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:13,855
- Meet me up here! 
- Okay.

413
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:17,853
- Go down, then meet me up here! 
- Right. Coming.

414
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:19,372
We stink at hiding.

415
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:31,016
What are you doing here? I thought you were both swamped with work.

416
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,461
Yes, well, Rory got a special...

417
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:37,729
- The chancellor gave me a... 
- I actually was able to take...

418
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:41,210
- half a day. 
- a half a day, too. And so we've...

419
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:43,796
- just to spend some time. 
- We're playing hooky.

420
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:45,638
Well then, just say that. How long have you been here?

421
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:46,944
- Hour and a half. 
- Where are your bags?

422
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:48,993
- We're just window-shopping. 
- Window-shopping?

423
00:23:49,106 --> 00:23:51,348
- Like Roz Russell and Ava Gardner. 
- What's the fun in that?

424
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:54,199
- There's no fun in that. 
- We're thinking of suing Roz and Ava's estates.

425
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:56,253
- Well, come on. 
- Oh. Ah. Where?

426
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:59,047
- Shopping. Come on. Pip-pip. 
- Mom, we were just leaving.

427
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,947
You're not leaving. Now, come on.

428
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,756
- I guess we're following my mother. 
- She's very aggressive today.

429
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,785
I think the passive part of her personality is playing hooky.

430
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:09,074
- Come on! 
- Coming!

431
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,006
Hey, did you guys bring silverware or drinking glasses or anything for the kitchen?

432
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:19,886
I didn't.

433
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:22,473
We've no bowls! We have no cups!

434
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:25,310
- But we do have a him. 
- Him? Him who?

435
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:27,993
- There's a him in one of the cupboards? 
- An ex-him, to be exact.

436
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,951
He's belly-up. He was a big boy, too. A big, fat, belly-up big boy.

437
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:33,507
Hey, watch it. That's my stereo!

438
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,630
We didn't need your stereo, Brian. We've got my stereo.

439
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,394
We've got three stereos and no forks.

440
00:24:39,574 --> 00:24:41,186
We're kind of lacking in shelf space.

441
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:44,724
Well, maybe you should skip displaying your Futurama action figures.

442
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:46,347
That might open space up a bit.

443
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:49,721
There are no curtains on the windows! People can see right in.

444
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:51,734
- What if we're naked? 
- Please, never be naked.

445
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,042
- I try not to be. 
- And how can there be no refrigerator?

446
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,628
- There's no refrigerator? 
- I just assumed there'd be one!

447
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:58,692
Great, so it's back to the Middle Ages for us.

448
00:24:58,856 --> 00:25:02,137
- Let's start storing meat in stocks of salt. 
- Is that someone looking in?

449
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,661
- What's that? 
- It's a night light.

450
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:08,819
Dude, when the Sex Pistols roomed together, no way did they have a night light.

451
00:25:08,998 --> 00:25:11,005
- You don't know that. 
- I read Johnny Rotten's book.

452
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:14,210
- There's no mention of a night light. 
- Towels! I don't have towels.

453
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:16,228
I've got this. This is not gonna work.

454
00:25:16,372 --> 00:25:19,576
Hey, when you said you had a bed for me, you didn't say it would be bunk beds.

455
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,670
But they're cool. The bottom one's like a fort.

456
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,883
- We're not playing fort. 
- We've got to start a list.

457
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,244
Anyone have paper or a pen or money?

458
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:32,377
Dude, look, this is my side of the shelf. Your stuff's encroaching.

459
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:33,380
It's not encroaching.

460
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:36,653
Bender and Leela are on my side. Put them back on your side.

461
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,452
That's not Bender. That's Nibbler. Bender's a robot.

462
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:42,530
Are you remotely aware that you're not twelve?

463
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:45,111
- They're on my side! 
- They're on my side, dude. Move them.

464
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:48,792
Guys, stop! Look down. There's a whole empty shelf for you to use,

465
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:51,162
- so you can stop bickering. 
- But we put that aside for you.

466
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:54,373
- What? 
- For your CDs and stuff. You need a shelf, Lane.

467
00:25:58,444 --> 00:25:59,963
Jeez. You smeared my glasses.

468
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,665
This is gonna work, one step at a time.

469
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:06,374
Listen, we set aside a shelf for you in the john, too.

470
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:07,470
You don't need to hug us for that.

471
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,711
- Mom, where the fire? 
- We have a lot to get through.

472
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:19,287
- Mrs. Gilmore, did I know you were coming? 
- Not unless you're clairvoyant.

473
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:21,484
- What are we looking for today? 
- What are we not looking for?

474
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:23,578
This is my daughter, Lorelai, and my granddaughter, Rory.

475
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,688
- Nice to meet you. 
- Same here.

476
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:26,363
What's new? I want a full report.

477
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:30,095
We have a china set that just arrived still in its crate that screams "Emily Gilmore."

478
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:33,704
- Hand-painted? 
- Designed in 1870 for the Shah of Persia -- the finest.

479
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:36,178
- Would you like to see it? 
- No need. Give me a set of twelve.

480
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:38,375
Plus soup tureens, sauce boats, the works. What else?

481
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:40,473
- Doreen. 
- That's gorgeous.

482
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,274
From Giorgio Baldi's studio in Venice.

483
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:44,155
- They only made eighteen. 
- Wrap them up.

484
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:44,996
Right away.

485
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,624
- Lorelai! 
- Your brake lights were out.

486
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:52,249
You! You've got Richard Gilmore's sizes on file.

487
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,450
Pull the latest Brionis in an assortment of colors and charge them to our account.

488
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,965
- Yes, ma'am. 
- What are Brionis?

489
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:58,712
Six months of my car payments, plus a car.

490
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:02,131
Include accessories and three pairs of loafers -- Italian. They should feel like butter.

491
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:04,379
- Make it four. Hell, make it six. 
- Yes, ma'am.

492
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:05,460
And jewelry.

493
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,906
Add an assortment of jewelry appropriate for a man with a moustache.

494
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:11,557
What would that be? Bracelets, pinkie rings?

495
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:14,541
And a moustache comb -- the most expensive one you've got.

496
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,914
I will look. Excuse me.

497
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,583
- Mom... 
- Keep up.

498
00:27:17,926 --> 00:27:19,370
Does Dad even want any of this stuff?

499
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:22,105
He doesn't know what he wants, Lorelai, so I choose what he wants.

500
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:23,548
- Excuse me. 
- Yes?

501
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:24,394
I want this.

502
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,681
I'm sorry, ma'am, that is just a display. It's not for sale.

503
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:29,494
- Everything's for sale. 
- I will take care of it.

504
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:31,684
Mom, Dad does not need another globe.

505
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,516
Then Rory can have it. She goes to college. She can use a globe.

506
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:36,585
It doesn't even have the right countries on it.

507
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:37,829
- C'mon. 
- Or California.

508
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:39,974
- Start picking! 
- Start picking what?

509
00:27:40,174 --> 00:27:42,535
- Everything, anything! 
- Mom, we don't have any money.

510
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,213
- It's on your father. 
- But, Grandma...

511
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:45,329
Some help, please.

512
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:48,106
- You like hats? 
- Kind of.

513
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,610
That one. Put it on her.

514
00:27:52,452 --> 00:27:56,226
I like it. These scarves all match, and of course you'll need gloves. We'll take them all.

515
00:27:57,071 --> 00:28:00,798
Hey, see those marbles rolling on the floor? They're Mom's. They spilled out of her head.

516
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:04,183
- I do like the chapeau. 
- Do not get sucked in! This is craziness!

517
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,882
-  It's just a hat. 
- It's a symbol.

518
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,859
We don't know what it's symbolizing. Resist.

519
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:08,678
Lorelai!

520
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:12,850
- You need a watch. 
- I don't wear a watch.

521
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:13,971
- Do you have a watch? 
- No.

522
00:28:14,074 --> 00:28:14,986
Then you need a watch.

523
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:17,146
These don't have diamonds. Which ones have diamonds?

524
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:19,317
- Next display. 
- Mom, I'm not buying a diamond watch.

525
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:21,822
- You just have to take it. 
- I'm not taking it.

526
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,285
I'm buying you a damn watch!

527
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,160
That one. Wrap it up.

528
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:28,969
Can I return the damn watch if I don't want it?

529
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:30,105
- Yes, ma'am. 
- Thank you.

530
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:37,304
- Are you keeping track? 
- I lost count.

531
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:39,106
She bought me four cocktail dresses, two evening gowns,

532
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:40,770
and if I'm not mistaken, eight maids a-milking.

533
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:43,622
By the way, she bought you a wedding dress when you weren't looking. Vera Wang.

534
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,747
Why didn't you stop her?

535
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:46,812
Well how do you stop a top from spinning around?

536
00:28:46,877 --> 00:28:47,990
This is too much.

537
00:28:48,332 --> 00:28:50,898
- Girls, come on. Keep up. 
- Mom.

538
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,151
- Stop dawdling and start picking some shoes. 
- Mom...

539
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:54,968
These Manolo Blahniks would look great on you.

540
00:28:56,207 --> 00:28:58,855
- Oh, me wants them, my precious. 
- You told me to resist.

541
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:00,780
Yeah, but that's before I saw these.

542
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:02,382
These are works of art. They should be in the Louvre.

543
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:05,536
Mrs Gilmore, I'm sorry. We only four of the Venetian apples in.

544
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:07,327
If you want the rest, we can have them shipped.

545
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:10,006
Well, give me the four today and ship the rest overnight whatever the cost.

546
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:10,763
Yes, ma'am.

547
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:13,513
- Mom, a quick word. 
- Where are your shoes?

548
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,074
Wait. What is the rush on the funny glass apples?

549
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:18,229
They're not funny, and I want them. That's the rush.

550
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:20,246
Yes, but you've already put quite a dent in your credit card

551
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:22,320
for things you don't seem to need.

552
00:29:22,438 --> 00:29:23,957
- So? 
- So it's crazy.

553
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,310
Crazy? You think this is crazy?

554
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:27,824
- Okay, Mom... 
- This isn't crazy!

555
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:29,857
- I didn't mean to... 
- That stupid moustache is crazy!

556
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:33,072
That's what's crazy! Your father's job is crazy! That's what's crazy!

557
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:36,384
He was supposed to be slowing down, and now he's club-hopping with Jason

558
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:39,677
and hanging out with Moby and having secret lunches with women and lying about it!

559
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:41,499
- Mom, Calm down. 
- Why should I calm down?

560
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:43,342
Are you on his side? Do you like that moustache?

561
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:44,741
I'm not taking sides.

562
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:47,463
I should go to bars! I should hang out with Moby! He'd hate that.

563
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:50,403
Mom, I'm just suggesting that you slow down on the shopping.

564
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:53,188
- This doesn't have to be a whole big thing. 
- Why do I need to slow down?

565
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:56,454
This is what I do, according to Richard. And he's not slowing down.

566
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,158
He's got a whole new life. He's got Pennilyn Lott, he's got Digger, he's got a moustache!

567
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:02,057
He's got all that and what do I have?

568
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:04,069
Maybe I should get a job so I can have my own life.

569
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:07,734
I could sell shoes here just as well Eduardo. I should get an application.

570
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:09,250
Get me an application! Go, go!

571
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:12,614
- Mom... 
- I hate that moustache, and he refuses to shave it!

572
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,918
- Mom, let's take a break. 
- I don't want to take a break!

573
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:16,910
Well, we do, and my feet are killing me.

574
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:18,732
- Well, then get some new shoes! 
- Come on.

575
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:25,885
Where are we going?

576
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,237
Right around the corner here.

577
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:28,798
We really should have taken our bags.

578
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:29,996
They said they'd hold them.

579
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,111
I'm totally turned around. Where are we?

580
00:30:32,218 --> 00:30:33,339
You'll smell in a second.

581
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:36,816
What is this?

582
00:30:37,323 --> 00:30:39,831
- It's the food court. 
- How long has this been here?

583
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:41,414
You've never been to the food court, Mom?

584
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:45,275
- Where do you eat when you shop? 
- I leave and go to a restaurant.

585
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:49,273
With this Valhalla of international cuisine so close?

586
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:52,566
- But it's cafeteria-style. 
- That's the fun.

587
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:54,291
Here. Best table in the house.

588
00:30:55,202 --> 00:30:56,179
It's plastic.

589
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,298
Plastic is a vital part of our bright tomorrow.

590
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:01,715
- Soon we'll all be living in plastic houses. 
- On the moon.

591
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:04,014
- What are you talking about? 
- We're pulling your leg, Grandma.

592
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:05,926
- Well don't do that. 
- So what are you in the mood for?

593
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:08,494
- I don't know. 
- I want Mexican.

594
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:10,474
I kind of feel like Moroccan and Chinese.

595
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:12,159
- So smorgasbord. 
- Yeah. Come on.

596
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:13,465
Wait. Here.

597
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:16,645
Oh, no, Mom. Moe's Moroccan Palace does not take credit cards.

598
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:18,237
- You're kidding. 
- It's on us.

599
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,227
Keep an eye on her. Make sure she doesn't wander off.

600
00:31:28,242 --> 00:31:30,649
The ad cannot run with the color composition the way it is.

601
00:31:30,745 --> 00:31:32,414
The drawing of the inn looks purple.

602
00:31:33,284 --> 00:31:36,312
Yes, I know, but I'm not paying for it looking like that.

603
00:31:36,418 --> 00:31:37,632
I do understand. It looks awful.

604
00:31:38,512 --> 00:31:41,969
Fine. Have him call me. I would love to sort it out. Okay?

605
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:44,293
Thank you. Bye. Sorry.

606
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,411
- What is all this? 
- It's lunch. Thanks, Lou.

607
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:49,747
I got a little something from everywhere.

608
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:51,364
I wouldn't know where to begin.

609
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,401
Well, start at the top and stop when you hit table.

610
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:58,384
I had no idea so many different kinds of foods came on sticks.

611
00:31:58,824 --> 00:32:00,693
Well, some come on sticks,

612
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:03,288
like the hot dogs and the fried cheese dipped in batter,

613
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:05,464
- but others are technically kabobs. 
- What's in the cups?

614
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:09,872
Well, you got your soda, your iced tea, root beer, lemonade.

615
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,125
- I'll try this. 
- Ah, Orange Julius.

616
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:12,919
A classic.

617
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:16,177
Oh, my. That's very good.

618
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:19,985
Your father and I know a man who owns a couple dozen of these stands

619
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,743
as part of his holdings. Now I can sincerely tell him I like his product.

620
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,853
- Excellent. 
- Oh, we forgot napkins.

621
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:27,522
Get some more little pepper thingies, please.

622
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:32,135
So dig in, Mom. You've got sweet-and-sour pork and pizza

623
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:36,099
and some wrapped thingy. I already forgot what it is, but it's probably not healthy.

624
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:40,307
Oh, and there's ice cream, too. We can get some after if you want.

625
00:32:40,563 --> 00:32:41,193
All right.

626
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:46,353
So how loud was I back there?

627
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:50,601
Well, you were heard.

628
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,022
If I had seen somebody act that way in a store, I would have called security.

629
00:32:55,795 --> 00:32:59,841
It's really okay, Mom. It wasn't that loud. It's totally forgotten.

630
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:04,259
Oh! Do not disturb. I'm eating.

631
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:07,310
What was that phone call you got before,

632
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:09,154
when you were coming over with the trays?

633
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:12,588
Oh, it's this ad we're doing for the inn. The drawing of the inn came out purple,

634
00:33:12,703 --> 00:33:15,010
like eggplant, like Prince chose the color. It was bad.

635
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,585
- Sounds awful. 
- It was their screw-up.

636
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:20,351
Just one of the many joyous things I get to deal with on a daily basis.

637
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:23,167
- You were very forceful. 
- Was I?

638
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:25,625
Very in command. I like how you handled it.

639
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:28,952
- Well, I learned from the best. 
- From whom?

640
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:34,666
From the lady eating her hamburger with a knife and fork. That's whom.

641
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:38,774
Oh, please. I order maids and salespeople around. That's different.

642
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:41,286
I've never done anything.

643
00:33:42,818 --> 00:33:45,194
Mom, come on. That's not true.

644
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,129
Richard's right. I buy things. Things I don't even want. It's all I have.

645
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:55,921
No, Mom, you have friends and family who love being with you.

646
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,637
And you have a house you love. You have a whole life.

647
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:03,365
You could have a dog if you want. There's a swell pet store here.

648
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:07,021
You're losing perspective, Mom. You're not seeing clearly.

649
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:09,735
If he would just shave that moustache.

650
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:11,690
And that's all it would take? Shaving his moustache?

651
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:14,281
Mom, you need to talk to him.

652
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:18,937
- He's always so distracted. 
- No. Make him talk. You need it.

653
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:23,158
And make it a real talk without bickering, without snipping, without mentioning Moby.

654
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,659
Really clear the air.

655
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:28,735
I got pepper, I got napkins, I got Lou's phone number. He asked me to give it to you.

656
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,166
- Oh, I'm privileged. 
- What'd I miss?

657
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:33,399
I was just admiring your mother's life.

658
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:34,715
Oh, I do that daily.

659
00:34:45,298 --> 00:34:47,140
Oh, God! Oh, God!

660
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:54,038
- Hey, Joe. 
- Hey, Luke.

661
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,452
- Can I get twenty singles off you? 
- Sure. It's gonna cost you $25.

662
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:01,538
- It's change humor. 
- I know. You do it every time.

663
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:02,706
-  I'll get them for you. 
- Thanks.

664
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:07,237
- Hey, Luke. 
- Hi, Dean.

665
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:08,250
Wait. Hold on.

666
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:12,658
No, you did good.

667
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:16,377
- Short of your record, though, Dean. 
- Yeah, I'll get there.

668
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:18,855
He's the reigning champ of every game in here.

669
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:22,716
I'm not here that much. I just come after dinner sometimes, y'know.

670
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,452
Lindsay and her mom kind of like me out of the way when they're cleaning up.

671
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,817
- They kick you out, huh? 
- I just slip out. They don't really notice.

672
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:33,436
- So how's married life treating you? 
- Good. Real good. Lindsay's great.

673
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,150
- Yeah, she seems great. 
- And her parents are fantastic.

674
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,608
- I mean, they help out so much. 
- Like with the cleaning up.

675
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,959
Her dad's over all the time, fixing things. Lindsay's got this list for him to do.

676
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:45,564
- Great. 
- They're the most unselfish people I know.

677
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:48,631
I've seen them around. The dad works for the county, doesn't he?

678
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:53,817
- He's a surveyor or something? 
- Yeah. Oh. He used to. But I think now he...

679
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:59,958
I think he's... actually, he manages an apartment,

680
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:03,916
so he oversees the guys, and he's not really...

681
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:07,603
- Not surveying much. 
- Yeah, he's not in the field much.

682
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:09,753
Okay, well, I'll let you get back to your game.

683
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:12,559
Yeah. Hey, see you later, man.

684
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:14,070
Thanks.

685
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:24,673
- What are you doing? 
- Taking inventory.

686
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:25,820
We should return it all.

687
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:28,841
Mom's gonna expect to see us with something she bought us.

688
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:31,370
- We have to keep something. 
- Seven hundred dollar yoga bag?

689
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:33,239
- Get out of here. 
- Oh, yes, my friend,

690
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,707
rich people like their sweaty mats to have expensive homes.

691
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,450
- We could each keep a little clutch purse. 
- What's that tubey one for?

692
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,161
- Lifesavers. 
- The candy?

693
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,421
- Yep. 
- Get out of here.

694
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:43,642
- Turquoise leather jacket? 
- Pass.

695
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,792
- Hair clips with diamond Betty Boops? 
- Pass.

696
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:49,951
- Tropical-print embroidered bikini? 
- Not me.

697
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:51,916
- Luke? 
- This is sick.

698
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:53,197
This I'll take.

699
00:36:53,355 --> 00:36:55,260
- Oh, no. I have dibs on that. 
- In your mind.

700
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,278
- I said it in the store. 
- Yeah and I said it, too.

701
00:36:57,364 --> 00:36:59,376
And I clutched it. It still has my clutch marks.

702
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:01,467
You do realize that the one thing we're fighting over is the free tote bag

703
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:03,268
- that came with our purchase. 
- It's a nice totebag

704
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:06,555
-  I'm upset just watching this. 
- This is your window on a whole other world, Luke.

705
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,916
The world of worthless rich-people stuff.

706
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:12,489
People of means see what they want and simply take it, regardless of others.

707
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:14,645
- You pour your own coffee? 
- Oh, yeah.

708
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,923
- You're not supposed to do that. 
- Oh yeah, sorry, I won't do it again.

709
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:29,002
- Does anyone know who this is? 
- No.

710
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,548
Yeah, it's Snuggles.

711
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,277
- You know Snuggles? 
- It's not Snuggles.

712
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:36,748
It's the dog that looks like Snuggles. Snuggles' owner picked him up.

713
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:38,837
No one picked this guy up and he has no tag.

714
00:37:38,935 --> 00:37:41,603
- You have a dog left over. 
- You knew Snuggles by name?

715
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:43,809
I don't have time for chitchat here, people!

716
00:37:43,892 --> 00:37:45,544
I have no idea whose dog it is.

717
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:46,898
- Me either. 
- Sorry.

718
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,146
I don't even know his name.

719
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:51,382
I was using random sounds, trying to see if he'd respond.

720
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:54,080
Paku. Gnocchi.

721
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:57,393
Nini. Bleeblo.

722
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:00,132
- Nothing. 
- Sorry.

723
00:38:00,521 --> 00:38:02,023
I've got to put up more flyers.

724
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,974
Sunna. Lipdoo. Funo...

725
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:11,626
- Thank God. I'm so tired. 
- Me too, and I have to get back to Yale.

726
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,505
- I had a great time today. 
- So did I.

727
00:38:13,644 --> 00:38:16,782
Okay, good. We should make this a regular part of our weekly schedule?

728
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:18,468
- Sounds good. 
- So next Tuesday?

729
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,744
Tuesday's good. Oh, shoot. I can't. Wednesday?

730
00:38:22,197 --> 00:38:24,099
Sure. I'll have to cancel plans with Jason.

731
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:25,871
Don't cancel plans with Jason.

732
00:38:26,153 --> 00:38:28,390
Dumb me, I've got class that night anyway.

733
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:29,624
All right. Skip ahead a week.

734
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,985
I hate that we have to schedule time like this.

735
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,176
- But if we don't, we don't see each other, right? 
- Right.

736
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:36,745
- So what about the weekend? 
- I'll be at Friday night dinner at Grandma's.

737
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:39,121
Great. I won't. Not this one. Darn.

738
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:43,970
- Hey, you want pie? 
- Yeah.

739
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,185
- 'Cause I'm getting my second wind. 
- Me too. Let's have pie.

740
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:50,186
Hey, Luke, we're having pie.

741
00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:52,403
Okay, just wait for me to serve it.

742
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:57,123
Should we be worried about Grandma?

743
00:38:57,624 --> 00:38:59,852
Oh, I think she'll be okay.

744
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,453
Was anything resolved? Are she and Grandpa gonna be all right?

745
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:08,663
Don't worry about it. They're a team. They'll be okay.

746
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:11,193
- Good. I like them. 
- I know.

747
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:22,904
Thanks.

748
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,428
Did you deal with that business with the gardeners?

749
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:36,122
Not yet.

750
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:42,456
We need to resolve that. Those vines are out of control.

751
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:43,987
I'll see to it.

752
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,001
Be nice to have that finished by the time I get back.

753
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:50,366
Get back? From where?

754
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:52,369
Jason and I are meeting some clients in Manhattan.

755
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:55,067
It's some new place downtown -- Tribeca, I think.

756
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:57,175
It's really an up-and-coming area.

757
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,342
I'll probably stay in the city, take the train in the morning.

758
00:40:02,614 --> 00:40:03,531
Is that all right with you?

759
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,123
That's fine.

760
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:10,637
What do you think of these?

761
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:12,920
The apples.

762
00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:17,345
I've always liked those.
