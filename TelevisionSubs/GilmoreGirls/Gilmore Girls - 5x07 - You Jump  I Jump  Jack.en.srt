1
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:07,675
- Oh, I'm late.
- I know.

2
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:09,768
Blame the insane people driving in front of me.

3
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:14,157
They had a "honk if you love to scuba dive" bumper sticker on the back of their car, so I honked.

4
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:16,568
- You don't scuba dive.
- Yes, but I've been testing people

5
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:20,183
who have "honk" bumper stickers lately to see if they really want people to honk.

6
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:24,991
Guess what? They don't. I lay on my horn, and this alleged scuba diver slows

7
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,724
to a crawl in front of me just out of revenge, and I'm screwed.

8
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:30,296
- You need a hobby.
- Yes, actually.

9
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:31,759
Come on, Rory's waiting.

10
00:01:32,184 --> 00:01:33,341
Hey, what happened?

11
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:34,642
She honked.

12
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:36,834
Oh, another bumper sticker test.

13
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,533
I just thought up a great idea for a reality show.

14
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:43,188
You pull people over who have those "honk if you love whatever" bumper stickers,

15
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:47,478
you kidnap them, and you make them do whatever the bumper sticker says they like to do,

16
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:49,422
whether they do it or not. And then you make them eat bugs.

17
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,954
So I hear you have a new boyfriend.

18
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,608
- How did you...?
- Not from me.

19
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:54,294
- Don't jump on Rory.
- How, Mom?

20
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,747
- Kirk told me.
- Kirk?

21
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:57,489
- Kirk who?
- How many Kirks do you know?

22
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,173
My Kirk? Stars Hollow Kirk?

23
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:01,872
Kirk who hasn't started shaving yet, Kirk? How did you find out from him?

24
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:04,340
I called the Inn looking for you, and Michel answered,

25
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:07,202
but he was in the middle of some argument with the horse veterinarian.

26
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:09,961
Then there was a cracking sound and the phone went dead.

27
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:12,146
Then there was another man's voice saying "hello".

28
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,290
- Kirk?
- Bob.

29
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:15,480
- The gardener?
- More twists than Oh Henry.

30
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:20,005
He told me something in a heavy spanish accent, all while Michel was yelling at the vet in French...

31
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,311
- I'll be, the UN erupts.
- Then Kirk came on.

32
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:25,337
He was there delivering something. And when I told him I was looking for you,

33
00:02:25,388 --> 00:02:28,496
he told me you were probably at your boyfriend Luke Danes' house.

34
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:31,159
- Now why were you hiding it from me?
- I wasn't hiding it.

35
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:33,871
You jumped on Rory when you thought she told me. You were hiding it.

36
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:36,790
- She did not jump on me, Grandma.
- Yeah, and I wasn't hiding it.

37
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,896
The only reason I reacted to Kirk the way that I did is that he's not in this world,

38
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:45,485
he's in my other world. It's as if I, out of the blue, told you I was having tea with Mrs. Van Uppity.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,845
- Who?
- Hortence Van Uppity,

40
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:49,320
tight bun, lace collar, tiny poodle... fictional friend?

41
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,744
You keep so much from me with these separate worlds of yours. It's not right.

42
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,631
I will try harder to merge the worlds. I promise.

43
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:57,723
Well, start now. I want to meet this Luke Danes.

44
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:58,699
You've met him.

45
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,891
Not in this capacity. I need to re-meet him.

46
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,642
Well, I'm sure that day will come.

47
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:03,963
- Next week.
- What?

48
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:06,051
You have a gentleman friend of significance.

49
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,207
Rhett is my gentleman friend, yes.

50
00:03:08,278 --> 00:03:11,012
So it's only proper that you introduce him to your mother.

51
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,986
Unless he's insignificant; I don't want to meet a passing ship. That's a waste of my time.

52
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:17,413
Is Luke a passing ship? Is he insignificant?

53
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:19,122
No, he's not.

54
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,432
I'll get my book and we will pick a date next week.

55
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:23,031
- Mom...
- Next week.

56
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:24,903
- But I...
- Next week.

57
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,605
Honk if Emily Gilmore views your mind as her personal playground.

58
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:30,157
Honk, honk.

59
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:28,136
We eat it, we breathe it, it's our heart and lungs.

60
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:31,921
What is it? The three basics: accuracy, accuracy, and accuracy.

61
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,032
It's my head that went up on a platter, okay? So go the extra yard. Protect my head.

62
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:37,971
Headache, Doyle?

63
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,306
Charles Graw used to eat aspirin like candy. He ate candy like candy, too, hence the belly like jell-o.

64
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:47,229
That was mean. The man's dead. So, how's the story coming? On that secret society.

65
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,559
The Life and Death Brigade. Get this. I've got a contact.

66
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:50,986
- Inside?
- Deep inside.

67
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:52,891
- Who?
- Anonymous. Don't ask again.

68
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:55,430
- Your call.
- I'm going to tell this story from the inside.

69
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,137
- You'll be careful?
- Careful enough.

70
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:58,561
- Well, stay on it.
- You bet.

71
00:04:59,804 --> 00:05:02,880
I love this. We just had a very All the President's Men moment.

72
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:06,209
- Very.
- Moving around the newsroom like that, felt good.

73
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:07,838
- Let's do it again sometime.
- Now?

74
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:09,408
- Might look silly.
- Carry on.

75
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:10,509
Right, Chief.

76
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,147
There you are.

77
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:15,624
Club sandwich, burger well done, fries.

78
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:17,406
Let me know if you need anything.

79
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:26,315
Hey. What's up? You're acting all squirrelly.

80
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,481
I'm ready now.

81
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:28,706
- For what?
- To date.

82
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:31,967
- Wow.
- That offer's still good, right?

83
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:34,240
- Yeah, still good.
- Okay.

84
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,128
So, we should pick a time.

85
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,040
Sure.

86
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:38,957
How about now?

87
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,891
- I'm kind of working.
- Right.

88
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:44,123
How about tonight?

89
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:46,079
- I've got band practice.
- Right.

90
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:47,205
And so do you.

91
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,063
'Cause we're in the same band.

92
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:52,816
Okay. So, we'll figure it out.

93
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,836
We'll figure it out.

94
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:54,813
Cool.

95
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,271
See you at home.

96
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,043
- Yeah, see you.
- Okay.

97
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,417
Hey, Lane, how's it going?

98
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:08,842
- Good, very good.
- Oh, well, lucky you.

99
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:11,833
Hey.

100
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:14,997
- How dark is it?
- How dark is what?

101
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,065
The cumulus nimbus hovering over my head.

102
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:20,546
- The black cloud. Was that a drop?
- What are you talking about?

103
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,860
- I have some very bad news.
- What?

104
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:26,336
- My mother is insisting on having dinner with us.
- That's it?

105
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:28,764
Did you hear what I said? Mother, dinner, us?

106
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,963
That's on a par with car, test, crash test dummy.

107
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:35,190
Don't worry, I'm going to do whatever it takes to get us out of this. I promise.

108
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,756
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

109
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:38,324
Let's just do it, get it over with.

110
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:41,888
Meeting the parents comes with the territory. We can't put it off forever.

111
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,205
Oh yeah? My fourth grade teacher wanted a meeting with my parents.

112
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:47,647
She was hit by a bus six years ago. Never got the meeting.

113
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:48,306
Book it.

114
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:49,551
- Luke!
- Book it.

115
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:53,489
Okay. But I'm warning you. If I call and tell her, and then you change your mind

116
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:56,049
and you want to back out, we're going to have to leave the country.

117
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,818
And have extensive facial surgery, and sex changes.

118
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,702
Both of us, so that we can, you know, kiss and not look funny.

119
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:05,423
- I'm not going to change my mind.
- Okay, fine, I'll just call her now...

120
00:07:05,532 --> 00:07:08,930
Oh, whoa, what is happening? Something dark is happening here.

121
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,224
It is heavy like iron.

122
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,255
Oh, did you feel that ice cold wind that just passed through?

123
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:15,075
Make the call.

124
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:17,124
I see dead people.

125
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,142
Make the call.

126
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:29,723
This is a house?

127
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,647
- This is a house.
- What a waste!

128
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,178
See, this is what causes peasants to revolt. This is how heads end up on pikes.

129
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:39,211
Open with that. That's a great icebreaker.

130
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:42,881
Now listen, I want you to be careful about your consumption of booze.

131
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,920
- I'm not going to drink too much.
- No, no, no. You've got it backwards, there, Pablo.

132
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:48,122
Ride the pink elephant, baby, 'cause it's your only defense

133
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,619
against Emily Gilmore unless you're packing a Kolishnikov.

134
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,319
Yeah, yeah. Shouldn't we ring the doorbell or something?

135
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,712
Oh, a little strategy. Here's the front door. We're here.

136
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:59,661
Drink cart's here. It's knock, knock. Open the door. "Hi. " "Hi. "

137
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:03,382
Turn left, veer right, past the couch, we're at the booze. Any questions?

138
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:06,043
Uh, yeah. Shouldn't you get a massage or something?

139
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:07,494
- Take off your coat.
- It's cold.

140
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:08,958
No, it's time consuming.

141
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:12,773
Roll it in a ball and have it ready to hand off to the maid. Yeah.

142
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,700
- Hi, hello.
- Hi, come in please.

143
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,051
Thank you. Sorry.

144
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:21,871
- Can I take your coats?
- Yeah, got mine all ready.

145
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:22,628
Alright.

146
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,555
Here you go. I'm Luke.

147
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:29,542
- I'm a maid.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

148
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:32,419
Oh, that was so sweet and innocent.

149
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,341
Well, well, our honored guest. Welcome.

150
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:36,545
Mom, Luke. Luke, Mom.

151
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:38,527
We've met, Lorelai. Several times.

152
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:41,072
Well, I was just "re-introducing" you, as per your instructions.

153
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,682
- Good to see you again, Mrs. Gilmore.
- Ah, no, it's Emily. I insist.

154
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:46,848
- Nice to see you, Emily.
- Drinks?

155
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,213
- We're in the foyer.
- Let's change that.

156
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:54,139
- Not if Luke wants a tour.
- Oh, okay, well, foyer, staircase, upstairs,

157
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,923
dining room, kitchen, weird piano area that we never really named,

158
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:58,864
and right through here is the living room.

159
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:03,508
Yeah, uh, I don't need a tour. Thanks.

160
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,994
Well, then, let's go in the living room.

161
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:07,809
Your house is beautiful.

162
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:10,324
- They don't make them like this anymore.
- I'll say.

163
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:13,645
They make everything out of cardboard now. White boxes with heating vents.

164
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:16,622
- Yeah. The art of craftsmanship is dead.
- Gin.

165
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:18,515
Do you have Tourette's or something?

166
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:21,008
I'm sorry. I thought I heard you say what would I like to drink.

167
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,205
- I was getting there.
- Gin martini, please.

168
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:25,710
I already made a pitcher of martinis, but they're vodka.

169
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:27,542
Vodka's perfect. Double with a twist.

170
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:31,695
So, two cold martinis with a twist, and Luke, how would you like a beer?

171
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:32,513
Great.

172
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,108
Or maybe Luke would like to choose his own drink. That's a thought.

173
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:39,430
Oh, yes, I'm sorry Luke. You can have whatever you like. I've got it all.

174
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,412
- Beer is perfect.
- Beer it is.

175
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,344
No, no, she's got everything. She's got scotch, she's got rum, she's got, uh, whiskey,

176
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:48,099
she's got red wine, she's not kidding, she's got it all.

177
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,329
Beer is perfect.

178
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:52,036
- Okay, bring him a beer.
- Here we are.

179
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,475
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Emily.

180
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:57,719
The beer is nice and cold. I almost want one myself.

181
00:09:58,016 --> 00:10:00,490
Hey, uh, you can have some of mine if you want.

182
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,909
So, how's that diner of yours?

183
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:09,408
It's doing great. No matter what the economic climate, people gotta eat.

184
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:14,545
That is so true. And I thought your place was very charming. Nice and rustic.

185
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:17,289
- Do you need a cough drop?
- She's fine.

186
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:19,229
- Where'd your martini go?
- To a happy place.

187
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:21,927
- Do you want another?
- Does Pavarotti want another donut?

188
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:23,627
- That's a yes?
- I'll pour it, Emily.

189
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:27,589
Thank you, Luke. I should go check on dinner. Will you excuse me?

190
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:29,184
Absolutely.

191
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,807
- Unbelievable.
- I know, she didn't make nearly enough.

192
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:35,746
- I meant you, you're acting crazy.
- She's insulting you!

193
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:38,049
No, she's not. Your mom's being great.

194
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,531
What? Were you in the room? Did you not hear the awful things she said?

195
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:44,026
- What did she say?
- Rustic diner? Rustic?

196
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:46,420
- So?
- Backhand slang for crap pile.

197
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:49,064
Or she was admiring its vintage feel.

198
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,641
- Oh, what was the other word she used?
- Charming?

199
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:54,542
- Ah, slang for doggie poopy.
- Unbelievable.

200
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:57,219
Wait, wait, what was the beer thing? Oh my God!

201
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:01,955
That was nice. I wanted beer, she was considerate enough to anticipate that that might be the case.

202
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:05,125
The word beer, backhand slang for nitwit juice.

203
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:07,234
You're reading way too much into this.

204
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:09,875
Excuse me, but I would defer to the Gilmore expert here.

205
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,812
I am the oracle. I carry all the knowledge.

206
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:15,258
Well, I would like you to calm down, because you're making me nervous.

207
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:18,119
- I'm trying to protect you.
- I'm a grown man,

208
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:22,374
and this isn't my first foray into the big city. I've dealt with all types of people in my life.

209
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,099
- Rich, poor, snobby, proud. I can handle it.
- But...

210
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:28,453
And by you jumping in after everything your mother says, makes me look weak.

211
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:30,796
- And I don't want to look weak.
- I don't want you to either!

212
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,312
Well, then, give me my space, okay? Please.

213
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:35,252
Okay, I'll give you your space.

214
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,352
Dinner is going to be as good as it smells, I guarantee it.

215
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:40,875
It smells wonderful, Emily.

216
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:42,287
Thank you, Luke.

217
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,614
- It's nice to have a kind gentleman in the house.
- Thank you.

218
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:48,456
So, you're recently divorced?

219
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:52,086
Uh, yeah, I guess.

220
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:55,558
Although, it depends on what you'd call recently.

221
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:58,498
In the last year, you've been divorced in the last year, that would be recent.

222
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:01,584
- Uh, yeah. Yes.
- Terrible, the divorce rate, isn't it.

223
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,648
- Yes, it's terrible.
- I'm sure it was inevitable in your case.

224
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,912
- Turned out that way.
- I hope there weren't children.

225
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:10,534
- No.
- Divorce destroys children.

226
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,483
But, without children, you're only harming yourself.

227
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:17,441
Of course, nowadays people get married for fun. Apparently there's nothing good on TV.

228
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:30,251
Hey. It's Dean. Uh, so, we were supposed to get together day after tomorrow,

229
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:33,046
but I have to cancel - again.

230
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:37,044
One day, I'm going to have one job, not three, which will simplify everything.

231
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:41,435
I hope. Anyway, um, I was hoping we could somehow hook up tomorrow night,

232
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:44,777
I forget if you have something going on, but I've got a three hour window,

233
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,772
and I was thinking dinner or something.

234
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:50,096
Maybe we can meet halfway between Yale and Stars Hollow.

235
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:54,387
That probably puts us on the interstate, meaning the six ninety-nine surf and turf special,

236
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,154
but hell, I'm a cheap date.

237
00:12:56,256 --> 00:13:01,104
Uh, so, not the most romantic get together for us, but something's better than nothing.

238
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:03,393
Let me know. Bye.

239
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:07,991
End of messages.

240
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:15,716
Diners are generally so filthy.

241
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:18,728
I'm sure yours isn't, but the horror stories you hear.

242
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,541
I read that one in Vermont got caught serving roadkill.

243
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:23,899
Do you know what that is?

244
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:26,915
Uh, yeah, it's, uh, dead animals from the street.

245
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:29,177
From the street, from the backyard, fished out of pools.

246
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:31,482
These diners find it and serve it. Again, probably not yours.

247
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:36,321
But the fact that this place got away with it at all is astounding.

248
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:40,637
I guess people who frequent diners don't look too closely at what they're eating out of self defense.

249
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:43,862
- We don't serve roadkill at my place.
- Well good for you.

250
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:47,743
I had a friend who ate at a diner once and the next day she dropped dead.

251
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:51,420
Her family considered suing the place but there's nothing to get from these people.

252
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:53,211
A couple of stools and a toaster.

253
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:57,276
But they were sure it was a matter of hygiene and they eventually drove them out of the state.

254
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:59,718
I don't want to tell you what they found when they moved the stove.

255
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:02,161
Would you like another beer, Luke?

256
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:06,354
...Opiate for the masses. Well, so what? We all have our opiates.

257
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,673
For some it's valet, for Luke it's baseball.

258
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:12,304
Whoever I heard say it just happened to say it about what Luke likes.

259
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:16,247
Oh, no! Some workman has left his filthy truck in our clean driveway!

260
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,840
- Richard must have sent for him.
- Oh, that's mine, actually.

261
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:23,538
Oh. Well, it's nice. Rustic.

262
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:25,306
- I like the color.
- Thank you.

263
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,453
And I like this coat of yours, there's something nice about simple cloth.

264
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,602
Thanks.

265
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:31,699
Well, this was wonderful. Don't be a stranger, all right?

266
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,035
I won't. Thank you, Emily.

267
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:35,381
- Goodbye. Bye, Lorelai.
- Bye, Mom.

268
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:36,138
Thanks, again.

269
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:42,742
You know what's amazing, I mean truly amazing.

270
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:43,199
What?

271
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:48,595
She never said anything directly bad about me or the diner or anything else concerning me.

272
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:50,848
- She's good.
- And all I did was thank her.

273
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:53,733
Over and over. She'd hammer me, and I'd thank her.

274
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:57,089
- It's a talent.
- "Rustic" really did sound like crap pile that time.

275
00:14:57,151 --> 00:15:00,145
Come on, babe. You'll feel better about halfway home.

276
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:02,598
- Good.
- Then the eye-popping nausea will hit you.

277
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:07,149
The rich food mixes with the bitter memories and it all gets worse, and then it gets better.

278
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:10,713
- Good.
- Until you get to Route 44, and then you hit bottom.

279
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:12,761
- Good. Great.
- I'll be ready with a tongue depressor

280
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:16,366
to keep you from swallowing your tongue. I keep them in my purse. Step up.

281
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,475
- Hey, Ace, you ready?
- Well...

282
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,561
- Hit it!
- Ah! Not so loud!

283
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:31,384
- You're very auditorily sensitive today.
- Oh, and your voice helps.

284
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:33,507
- Is the blindfold secure?
- Secure and in place.

285
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,545
Our anonymity's crucial, Logan. Crucial.

286
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:38,612
- What's wrong with Finn?
- Great job with the blindfold, Logan.

287
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:41,510
- I recognized your voices, Colin.
- Could everyone keep it down, please.

288
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,572
- Can we remove the blindfold now?
- We're also hiding our destination.

289
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:47,179
- We had to leave at this ungodly hour.
- It's four in the afternoon.

290
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:49,057
- He's got a thing about the sun.
- It's too bright.

291
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:52,247
- So how come you're not wearing your gorilla masks?
- She can see.

292
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,664
- I can tell because your voices aren't muffled.
- She's sharp.

293
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:57,947
- Who's the girl?
- I've been told we've met. I've no memory of it.

294
00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:00,792
- Oh, Gorilla Girl.
- Oh, well, isn't that a pretty nickname.

295
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,307
- Oh, by the way, this thing's overnight.
- Overnight?

296
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:06,066
- Didn't I mention that before?
- Oh, must have slipped your mind.

297
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,207
- That doesn't screw up anything for you, does it?
- No.

298
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:09,398
- No?
- Nope.

299
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:13,413
- Hmm. Loose schedule. Good.
- We like our schedules loose, like our women.

300
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:14,144
Clever.

301
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,927
My God, it's early.

302
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:23,044
- Luke's.
- Good afternoon, I'm calling for Mr. Luke Danes.

303
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:25,916
- This is Luke Danes.
- Please hold for Mr. Gilmore.

304
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:30,841
- What? For who? Hello?
- Luke? Richard Gilmore here.

305
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,250
Uh, uh, hi, Richard. Mr. Gilmore, sir, how are you?

306
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:39,591
I'm fine, thank you. Listen, I thought we could meet for a round of golf, you and I.

307
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,769
- Golf?
- Tomorrow afternoon's good for me.

308
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:44,118
Is that good for you?

309
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:48,093
- Well, uh...
- Good. I'll have Margie call you back with the details.

310
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:49,606
Okay.

311
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:51,881
Wonderful, I look forward to it. See you at the club.

312
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,322
Yeah, see you at the club.

313
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:08,946
This mountain air has revivified me.

314
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,509
Make sure he doesn't run off a cliff.

315
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:13,865
Stephanie, it's your turn.

316
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,940
Finn! You slow down!

317
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:22,041
You okay?

318
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,430
I smell trees.

319
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,045
Oh, nothing gets past you.

320
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:33,767
So the firing squad is just up ahead?

321
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,076
Yup, and there's a line. Damn.

322
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:40,269
Seriously, Logan, is the blindfold coming off, or am I Patty Hearst-ing it the whole trip?

323
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,258
It's coming off. It's coming off right now.

324
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:50,622
Oh, my.

325
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,873
You cannot go golfing with my father.

326
00:17:57,022 --> 00:18:00,420
- It's a done deal.
- What is that man up to? What is he doing?

327
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:01,917
- Ouch.
- What are you doing?

328
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:04,794
I'm looking for a book my dad had somewhere around here.

329
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:07,794
"Learn Golf the Arnold Palmer Way. " I can't find it.

330
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:11,236
I beseech you. Do not go golfing with my father.

331
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:13,943
- It's too late. I said yes.
- Why? Why did you say yes?

332
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,600
- I had no choice.
- Well, saying no is a choice.

333
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:18,803
Did you learn nothing from the dinner with my mother?

334
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:21,035
- Apparently not.
- Call him and cancel.

335
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:24,343
- Right, and how would he take that?
- Badly, that's why you just hang up real quick.

336
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,780
And this is a good way to start a relationship with your father.

337
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,952
No, this is the way to end it. God, you're slow.

338
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:33,452
Listen, call him and tell him that, um, when he called, you had just dropped some paoti,

339
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:37,947
and you were tripping, and you were seeing vapors, and that's why you agreed,

340
00:18:38,003 --> 00:18:40,697
but then you landed and realized that you can't go.

341
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:43,160
Wait, do you smoke paoti? We should get that straight before you call him.

342
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:46,616
- Backing out will make it worse.
- But do you even know how to play golf?

343
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:50,702
I took a course in summer school but I accidentally hit Kent Calida in the head with a driver

344
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:53,558
and got asked to leave, but I think I remember the basics.

345
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:56,067
Grab the club, whack a ball. I'll fake it.

346
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,278
- Luke...
- Don't worry, I'll be fine.

347
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,803
Okay. Fine then, bye.

348
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,327
- Hello.
- Hi, Dad. I need a favor.

349
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:14,387
- The biggest favor I may ever ask you for, ever.
- I don't like the sound of this.

350
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,480
- Please cancel this golf game with Luke.
- What? No!

351
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:21,063
But why? Why are you doing this? What is the point?

352
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,582
- How is this even your business?
- He's my boyfriend.

353
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:26,126
And this is my right. Your mother already met him.

354
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:30,539
At a secret dinner I only found out about because her blabbermouth maid told my valet.

355
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:31,944
So now, I want to meet him.

356
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,291
- But you've already met him.
- Well I need to re-meet him.

357
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:36,960
Why can't you and mom meet someone once and make it stick?

358
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:38,880
I insist upon this golf game.

359
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:41,251
- He doesn't even golf.
- He said he did.

360
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:45,229
Yeah, well, he whacked Kent Calida in the head with a club, okay?

361
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,190
So you're taking your life in your own hands. You want to reconsider now, huh?

362
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:50,990
- You like your head, huh?
- Lorelai, tee time is set,

363
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:54,451
Luke has said yes to my proposal, and tomorrow Luke and I are golfing.

364
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:58,289
- Have fun.
- This is not about having fun, this is protocol.

365
00:19:58,352 --> 00:19:59,878
Well, have a good protocol, Dad. Bye.

366
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,625
- Is this what you expected?
- No, not at all what I expected.

367
00:20:03,908 --> 00:20:07,830
Let me guess what you were thinking: sleeping bag, flashlights, keg,

368
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:11,920
three boxes of stale Triscuits, half eaten bag of Oreos, some Doritos and a bong.

369
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:13,636
That may be exactly what I pictured.

370
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,643
You can apologize later. This is yours.

371
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:16,646
Mine?

372
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,298
Not much closet space, but the view's decent.

373
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:20,431
It's cozy.

374
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,624
Festivities start in half an hour.

375
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:37,408
Dean, hi. It's me. I got your call.

376
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:43,184
I would love to have dinner with you tonight, but something unbelievably unexpected came up,

377
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:45,753
and it's going to keep me busy for a couple of days.

378
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:50,394
I'd give you more info, but it's all a little Dali-esque and hard to explain.

379
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,390
I'll fill you in when I get home. If I get home.

380
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,314
Just kidding. I hope. Bye.

381
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:17,504
Am I early?

382
00:21:17,663 --> 00:21:18,512
Right on time.

383
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:19,885
You look good.

384
00:21:20,355 --> 00:21:22,598
Thanks, so do you. Have I seen those pants?

385
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,547
I got them from the bottom of my drawer. I forgot I had them.

386
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:26,376
Cool.

387
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:29,726
So what do you feel like doing?

388
00:21:30,575 --> 00:21:34,282
We could drive somewhere. We just have to stop for gas... and add some oil,

389
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,699
and put some air in the tires, and we'd have to stop by an ATM.

390
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:38,322
Or we could hang out here.

391
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,098
- Sure.
- Yeah.

392
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,274
Okay! Cool.

393
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,803
Let's get a pizza, and watch something, and just hang out.

394
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:47,516
Great!

395
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:51,362
What do you want to watch?

396
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:54,425
Want to finish watching what we started last night?

397
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:56,411
Yeah. Great.

398
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:03,985
Hey, guys.

399
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:08,954
Ooh, Stop Making Sense. Great.

400
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:14,614
- This is where we left off last night.
- What are you doing?

401
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:18,535
- Watching TV.
- Uh, Brian, this is a date.

402
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:19,630
What?

403
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:22,236
Lane and I are kind of on a date right now.

404
00:22:22,753 --> 00:22:23,475
You are?

405
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,759
- But this is what we did last night.
- I know.

406
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:28,580
- So, last night was a date, too?
- That was not a date.

407
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:29,978
I was in my underwear.

408
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:32,554
But we did exactly the same thing, you just had no pants.

409
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:36,947
Well, we're kind of starting to date, and this is what we're going to do.

410
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:40,832
- So, where do I go?
- Well, how about my room?

411
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,483
- Really? You never let me in your room.
- Well, now's your chance.

412
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:46,603
- Great!
- Wait, hold on.

413
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:49,885
- Shouldn't we leave your room empty?
- Why?

414
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:51,554
You know, in case the date goes good?

415
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,056
- Brian, go in my room.
- Thanks!

416
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:58,159
Man, it smells good in here.

417
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:19,795
Hey. Rory Gilmore. Um, this is quite a soiree.

418
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:22,351
Are all the Life and Death Brigade gatherings this elaborate?

419
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,325
How about *** social stands?

420
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:28,648
Ridiculous. Total stand-still for all in his vicinity. What do you say?

421
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,567
- I concur totally.
- Crazy construct if you think for a bit.

422
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:33,922
Dubious logic if you ask this thoughtful guy.

423
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:36,134
- Hello, everybody.
- My God.

424
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:39,381
- Shocking.
- Silly girl. Not adjusting to this proud point of ours.

425
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:41,693
- Sad, this diminishing vision.
- Excuse me?

426
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,686
- Full count is six, I say?
- Six, no doubt. Ay, again I concur.

427
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:48,416
Point in fact, daft lady, to catch on would prompt our congratulations.

428
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,475
- It�s a game?
- At which you totally fail.

429
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,210
- You want for instruction?
- Apparently.

430
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:56,143
Said gap �twixt �d� and �f� shall not slip from lips in any word this group allows.

431
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:59,348
Said gap �twixt �d� and �f� � you�re not using the letter �e�?

432
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,195
- Said this thing our group did banish.
- Loud, for all to drink in!

433
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:05,620
- Daft girl.
- So, no one is supposed to say the letter �e�.

434
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:08,933
- My God, this woman hounds us with this thing I banish.
- Dumbfound.

435
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:11,897
Um, I�ll catch up with you guys later. Have fun. If that�s what you�re doing.

436
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,220
- Bloody horror, that woman.
- Ostracism should occur, I think.

437
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:22,921
Hi, Stephanie.

438
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:25,895
Oh, good, you�re using �e�s. No champagne?

439
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:27,375
No, I�ll have a little later.

440
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:32,844
- So, is Logan the head of the group?
- There�s no head of the group, Rory.

441
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,429
We�re an anarchy collective, we don�t recognize leaders per se.

442
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,906
Plus it�s a secret. I shouldn�t be talking to you.

443
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:40,944
Warning sign.

444
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:45,614
Because the way that people act around him, Logan kind of seems�

445
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,410
- Cute?
- No.

446
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,454
- No?
- Well, yes, but...

447
00:24:48,516 --> 00:24:49,484
There�s a line to get to him.

448
00:24:49,617 --> 00:24:51,911
Oh, no, I�m not looking to get in a line. I�m a reporter.

449
00:24:51,972 --> 00:24:55,070
Bet you�re a good reporter. And a very good girl.

450
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,269
Oh dear, I�m talking to you. I shouldn�t be talking to you.

451
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,564
I have to kill myself now � excuse me.

452
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:07,574
Hi.

453
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:09,857
Hi. Um, I was wondering.

454
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:14,219
Is the safari thing something you always do, or do you choose different themes?

455
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:16,242
- May I quote Max Ernst?
- Sure.

456
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:26,426
- How goes it, pariah?
- Logan?

457
00:25:26,537 --> 00:25:28,585
Word was a bear dragged you off.

458
00:25:28,663 --> 00:25:32,110
No bear, I just wanted a quiet place to collect my thoughts.

459
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:33,005
You found it.

460
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,346
Thanks, I�ve eaten.

461
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:36,134
Good. This is for me.

462
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:40,307
Sorry you�re not getting much from the group.

463
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,665
Took a little arm-twisting to get them to agree to let you come in the first place.

464
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:47,639
I don�t need their cooperation. I�ve already filled two notebooks without their cooperation.

465
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,716
Half of one without using the letter �e�, but I could use yours.

466
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:52,231
Way too much salt on this.

467
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,866
I mean, this is pretty incredible, but it�s just a preamble to the big stunt tomorrow, right?

468
00:25:55,915 --> 00:25:57,929
It�s Finn, he�s Australian. They like salt.

469
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:02,163
How do you pay for this? Are there dues, or do you chip in, is there alumni sponsoring it?

470
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:06,720
How is it organized? And what is happening tomorrow? Is it just as big, or bigger?

471
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:11,057
And do people know that you�re here? Park Rangers, or the landowner? Where are we?

472
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,863
Are we still in Connecticut? And your answer cannot include the word salt.

473
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:14,922
Okay.

474
00:26:16,864 --> 00:26:19,715
I think it�s time to fill you in on the conditions of you being here.

475
00:26:19,797 --> 00:26:22,064
- Okay.
- First, no pictures.

476
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:24,594
Aw, you�ll get it back at the end of the trip. Second, no names.

477
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,771
I�m not exactly being introduced to anyone as it is.

478
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:30,565
Third, no physical descriptions of any of us. There are authority figures up and down Connecticut

479
00:26:30,611 --> 00:26:33,339
trying to nab us for things we may have done in the past. Naughty things.

480
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:34,670
Keep you anonymous.

481
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:35,690
What number am I on?

482
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:36,759
Just at third.

483
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:41,070
- Fourth, no identification of our location.
- I don�t know where we are.

484
00:26:41,126 --> 00:26:43,073
- Fifth.
- You�re going to run out of -ifths.

485
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:48,341
Most important condition of all. You must agree not to interfere with the integrity of the event.

486
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,948
What is the event, and how could I interfere?

487
00:26:51,014 --> 00:26:51,897
So you agree?

488
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:53,409
Yes, I agree.

489
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,529
- It�s pretty.
- It�s drunk.

490
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:02,708
Well it sounds pretty. I like it.

491
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,039
I didn�t say I didn�t like it.

492
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:07,663
- Logan?
- Yeah?

493
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:09,661
- You coming?
- I�ll be right there.

494
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,879
I�ll leave the light for you, Ace. I won�t need it.

495
00:27:14,172 --> 00:27:15,447
Hurry up, darling.

496
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:18,016
Here I am.

497
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:28,851
- David Byrne is a freak.
- I love him.

498
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:29,768
He�s totally cool.

499
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:30,963
So.

500
00:27:31,642 --> 00:27:32,296
So.

501
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:33,766
This was nice.

502
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:34,894
Yeah.

503
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:35,952
I like your place.

504
00:27:36,894 --> 00:27:37,867
Hm, right.

505
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:42,331
I have to get up early for work tomorrow.

506
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,171
No problem.

507
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:44,866
So I should probably�

508
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:46,659
Oh, right, right.

509
00:27:58,555 --> 00:27:59,381
Goodnight Zach.

510
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:00,456
Goodnight.

511
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,896
Oh, no.

512
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:09,735
This is bad news. Once he hits his REM state, Motorhead wouldn�t wake him.

513
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:10,722
What do I do?

514
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:21,982
He really is asleep.

515
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,412
He�s gained a couple of pounds, too.

516
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,375
Okay, well, I had a really good time.

517
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:33,548
Me, too.

518
00:28:41,404 --> 00:28:42,981
- Night, Zach.
- Night, Lane.

519
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:02,190
Another day, another sartorial surprise.

520
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:04,653
- Start getting ready yourself.
- I am ready.

521
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:05,962
Dressed like that?

522
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:08,390
Well, I didn�t have the it�s an overnight thing� warning,

523
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:11,262
so unless you want me to fashion something out of pinecones, this is it.

524
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:13,786
That clothing is going to interfere with the integrity of our event

525
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,840
and you agreed not to interfere with the integrity of our event.

526
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:18,901
All I�ve got is a washbowl, a towel and a toothbrush.

527
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,873
Is that all you�ve got? Look again, Ace.

528
00:29:49,382 --> 00:29:50,804
Excuse me, Mr. Gilmore?

529
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,079
- Luke?
- Yeah, hi.

530
00:29:52,831 --> 00:29:55,233
- I don�t remember you being this tall.
- Yeah. Sorry.

531
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,013
Oh, it�s nothing to apologize about. Where are your clubs?

532
00:29:58,771 --> 00:30:01,203
Oh, I just figured I�d, uh, rent some.

533
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:03,369
- Oh, waste of money. Owning�s the thing.
- Right.

534
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,525
- There is no better place than our pro shop.
- Great.

535
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:07,502
- Let�s go get you some clubs.
- Excellent.

536
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:17,142
I got your event integrity right here, mister.

537
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:20,465
Yep. I got an eye for dress sizes. We go this way.

538
00:30:30,224 --> 00:30:33,030
- Come on, hurry.
- You try running in a crinoline.

539
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:35,122
- We�re late.
- For what? The ritual sacrifice?

540
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:38,866
I do declare here gathered, one hundred and eighth assembly

541
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,775
of the honorable Life and Death Brigade.

542
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:42,880
He�s using �e�s.

543
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:47,990
Please raise your glasses. In Omnia Paratus!

544
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:50,064
In Omnia Paratus!

545
00:30:55,202 --> 00:30:57,048
- Now you might want to cover your ears.
- Why?

546
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,935
And to think some groups just go bowling.

547
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,285
Pull!

548
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:52,498
Pull!

549
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:55,390
Good shot! Pure skill!

550
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:56,778
- Is this safe?
- No.

551
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:59,220
Pull! �Damn.

552
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:00,715
Blame the gun. I would.

553
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,323
Pull! Pull!

554
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:09,092
- All right, I�m bored. I want to be a target.
- You�re always a target, Finn.

555
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:11,073
In Omnia Paratus.

556
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:13,525
You want to interview Finn, Ace, you should do it quick. Pull!

557
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:15,529
- Not bad.
- Thank you.

558
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:17,415
- So is this your big stunt?
- Big stunt?

559
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:20,176
According to my research, you guys always do one big thing at your gatherings.

560
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:21,144
Pull!

561
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:23,490
- Is this it?
- Does it look like it?

562
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:26,141
- I�m guessing no.
- You answered your own question. Pull!

563
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,469
- You�ll know it when you see it.
- Good.

564
00:32:30,508 --> 00:32:33,013
- I missed the mat.
- Again?

565
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:36,059
I�ll be fine. Don�t worry about me. In Omnia!

566
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:54,271
- You�re on your game today, Mr. Gilmore.
- Indeed I am.

567
00:32:54,323 --> 00:32:55,899
- Indeed.
- Indeed.

568
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:59,786
I�m going to speak to the board about these grounds.

569
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:02,387
There are dry spots the length and breadth of this fairway.

570
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,688
Oh, I�m up. Okay. Let�s see�

571
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:12,533
I think this one is� not the one I want at all, but this one here�

572
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,935
Oh, good choice. Let�s take the tag off there.

573
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:17,993
Good idea. Okay, ball goes down here.

574
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:30,914
- Aw, damn.
- No problem.

575
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:34,392
- It�s heading toward the wrong hole.
- It�s just a Mulligan, son. Try it again.

576
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:38,856
Golf isn�t my thing, you know. It�s definitely a thing, but not my game.

577
00:33:39,114 --> 00:33:42,384
- Well, what is your main hobby?
- Uh� Give me a hobby, quick.

578
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,542
- Uh, reading.
- Reading. I read like crazy.

579
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:47,468
Wonderful! What have you been reading lately?

580
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:52,440
Uh, books. You know, this, that. Dick!

581
00:33:52,716 --> 00:33:55,092
- Dick?
- That Dick guy, science fiction guy,

582
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:58,092
Dick something, something Dick� I just read one of his.

583
00:33:58,154 --> 00:34:01,267
Well, I�ll bring Dick up on the internet, see what comes up.

584
00:34:01,323 --> 00:34:05,076
- Wish I could remember that name.
- You better hit your ball, son. We�re stacking up.

585
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:06,453
Right, yeah. Okay.

586
00:34:08,902 --> 00:34:11,466
Just a second, guys, he�s, uh, he�s new.

587
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:22,517
Not to worry, the cart�s been dinged a thousand times.

588
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:25,085
- The guy driving it looked mad.
- Not to worry. Let�s go.

589
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:29,037
- So, have you put much thought into franchising?
- Franchising?

590
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:30,349
That diner of yours.

591
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,650
Now is the time to jump. There are opportunities abounding in real estate right now.

592
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:36,739
Eh, well, no, I haven�t.

593
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:41,218
I�d concentrate on the eastern seaboard, first. Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts.

594
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:43,937
- I�d start with, uh, five to seven.
- Diners?

595
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:47,153
Something manageable. You�ll need an investment banker, ah.

596
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:50,455
Just ran into Herb Smith in the clubhouse, best banker in the business, I�ll give him your number.

597
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:51,039
Good.

598
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:54,479
So, once the first seven are a go, shoot for the moon.

599
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,895
National expansion. Set up a public corporation, issue an I.P.O.

600
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:00,102
Yeah, sure. An I.P.O. Gotta set up one of those.

601
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,332
- Have you ever gotten a straight razor shave?
- No.

602
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:06,618
Shaves you close, lasts for days. I�ll give you my barber�s card.

603
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,428
- Hope you�re thinking up superlatives.
- What are they going to do?

604
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,409
- What do you think they�re going to do?
- They�re not going to jump.

605
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:25,308
- Jump!
- That�s like seven stories! They�ll die!

606
00:35:25,368 --> 00:35:28,196
- We�re all going to die one day.
- But those four are today.

607
00:35:28,363 --> 00:35:29,050
Six.

608
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:31,033
- I see four.
- I�m heading up.

609
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:32,931
- Of course you are.
- And Finn was supposed to do it,

610
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:35,665
but few of us figured he�d make it this far, so there�s an extra space.

611
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,401
- No!
- And we�re not going to die.

612
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:43,161
No one in the Life and Death Brigade has ever died. Old ones have.

613
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:45,343
- I am not going to jump!
- We�re all set.

614
00:35:45,582 --> 00:35:48,405
- This is Seth, he�s the genius behind all this.
- It�s very safe.

615
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,752
We did a dozen successful test drops, every potato came through without a scratch.

616
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:52,547
Potato?

617
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,701
You can�t test using people, that�d be dangerous!

618
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:58,039
Look, thanks for the offer, but I�m here as a journalist.

619
00:35:58,097 --> 00:36:00,098
An observer. Journalists do not participate.

620
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:00,999
Since when?

621
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,586
Since forever.

622
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:04,666
- George Plimpton never participated.
- What?

623
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:06,433
His best stuff put him in the think of it.

624
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,703
Fighting Sugar Ray Robinson, quarterbacking for the Lions, skating for the Bruins.

625
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,901
So he participated.

626
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:13,564
Bill Buford lived with soccer hooligans in amongst the thugs.

627
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:16,472
Ernie Pyle was so deep in the action in World War II, he was killed by a Japanese sniper,

628
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:18,644
- not that you gotta go that far.
- Buford, Pyle. I know.

629
00:36:18,704 --> 00:36:21,388
Richard Hottelet was four months in a Nazi prison working for the U.P.

630
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,640
Hunter Thompson lived with the Hell�s Angels.

631
00:36:23,692 --> 00:36:26,297
Got in the muck, didn�t just orbit around it, and it drove his writing.

632
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,770
He put you in those biker�s parties. He put you in those biker�s heads.

633
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:32,969
All right, all right, so, those guys participated. I got it, but I...

634
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:35,478
- Jumpers to their places, please!
- You�re scared.

635
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:37,684
- Well, yeah!
- And that stops the greats?

636
00:36:37,772 --> 00:36:40,827
- It�s stopping this great!
- Come on, you look like you need a little adventure.

637
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,897
- What does that mean?
- You�re just a little sheltered.

638
00:36:42,956 --> 00:36:47,495
Why? Because I haven�t spent time in a Nazi prison, been stomped on by hooligans

639
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,977
and beat up by Hell�s Angels? And Plimpton got banged up pretty good too.

640
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:53,306
It�ll be fun, it�ll be a thrill.

641
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,593
Something stupid, something bad for you. Just something different.

642
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,664
Isn�t this the point of being young?

643
00:37:00,328 --> 00:37:03,801
It�s your choice, Ace. People can live a hundred years without really living for a minute.

644
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,444
You climb up here with me, it�s one less minute you haven�t lived.

645
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:10,867
Let�s go.

646
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:12,562
Let�s go!

647
00:37:14,687 --> 00:37:17,396
- But I am not a fan of ladders.
- They scare the crap out of me, too.

648
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,580
High. We are very high.

649
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:53,815
I�ve been higher.

650
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:56,461
- I meant distance from the ground.
- That, too.

651
00:37:56,748 --> 00:37:59,969
This is totally safe. And it goes with your outfit. Nice.

652
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,059
- Why do they look so worried?
- We�re low on champagne.

653
00:38:06,904 --> 00:38:08,858
You can back out, you know. No one�s forcing you.

654
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:09,810
I know.

655
00:38:12,427 --> 00:38:13,559
You trust me?

656
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:19,614
- You jump, I jump, Jack.
- In Omnia Paratus!

657
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:22,431
I really should have confirmed that those potatoes were okay.

658
00:38:30,503 --> 00:38:31,463
Oh, thank God.

659
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:35,472
You did good, Ace!

660
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,919
Once in a lifetime experience!

661
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:39,404
Only if you want it to be.

662
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:43,966
All right, thanks.

663
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:49,541
- Good afternoon, Dragonfly Inn.
- I franchised my place.

664
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:50,898
- What?
- The diner.

665
00:38:50,948 --> 00:38:55,997
There�s going to be seven of them, and that�s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I�m going national.

666
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,449
What are you talking about?

667
00:38:57,575 --> 00:39:01,271
Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke�s Diners,

668
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,484
- and I think I agreed to it.
- No!

669
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,741
I�ve already got a marketing guy, Herb�s my banker,

670
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:09,295
your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently,

671
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:12,648
everyone is going to be able to buy stock!

672
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:16,192
- Ugh! My parents, my stupid parents!
- And he wants to shave me.

673
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:19,662
- Shave what?
- I don�t know, he just kept talking about shaving me,

674
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:24,157
and I�m tipsy. We hit the club bar, and I didn�t want to sound dumb

675
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:26,401
and just order a beer because it�s nitwit juice,

676
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:29,290
so I had what your dad was having which was whiskey something,

677
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,144
more whiskey than something, let me tell you, �cause I can�t even see straight.

678
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:36,323
- Aw, you poor thing.
- And I�ve got an art dealer now.

679
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,184
No!

680
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:40,753
I�m driving to Manhattan next week to look at some Diebenkorns. What�s a Diebenkorn?

681
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,679
I don�t know.

682
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:44,674
Oh, and I bought some golf clubs, they cost the same as a car.

683
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:45,693
Where are you now?

684
00:39:45,776 --> 00:39:48,913
I�m at the driving range, your dad�s making me practice for next time.

685
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,116
No! Leave! You do not need to practice.

686
00:39:51,202 --> 00:39:54,106
Oh, and I sort of implied that I�m fond of the Greeks,

687
00:39:54,188 --> 00:39:58,350
so I have to read the Iliad and the Odyssey so we can chat about it,

688
00:39:58,406 --> 00:40:01,090
and can we not hang out with your parents for a very long time?

689
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:03,993
- For a very long time.
- I mean, I don�t hate them.

690
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:07,433
- Leave the driving range at once.
- I don�t think I can drive.

691
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:09,403
Honey, have some coffee and then come home.

692
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,078
The Diebenkorn guy is still in there.

693
00:40:12,137 --> 00:40:13,878
You stay away from the Diebenkorn guy.

694
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,056
He�s chatting with my rare coin guy.

695
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,723
Just do not go back in the clubhouse. Go straight to your car.

696
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:20,884
Okay. I like the valet guys.

697
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:23,038
- Good, now go.
- I�m going.

698
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,393
Why would you go golfing with that man? Why on earth?

699
00:40:29,454 --> 00:40:30,206
Who, Luke?

700
00:40:30,283 --> 00:40:32,609
You are encouraging this ridiculous relationship.

701
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:33,786
Emily, please.

702
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,573
He is not good enough for Lorelai, or to be Rory�s stepfather! God forbid!

703
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:40,437
Can we be a little more of a snob, Emily?

704
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:43,831
The fact that you paraded him around the club. Our club!

705
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:48,633
It happened to be a fruitful outing. I am going to assist him in franchising his diner.

706
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:52,893
Richard! That hurts-out-loud is not capable of running a complex business!

707
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:57,292
Well, that�s obvious, Emily! That�s why he will have no significant role, he will be the frontman!

708
00:40:57,383 --> 00:40:59,601
We�ll shave him, stick his picture on the menus.

709
00:40:59,678 --> 00:41:03,247
The whole thing will, hopefully, bestow some credibility on him.

710
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:07,313
At least then, if this insane relationship between him and Lorelai continues,

711
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:09,907
we can legitimately take him to places like the club.

712
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:12,273
At least, on holidays.

713
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,299
This is absurd. You�re absurd, the whole thing�s absurd.

714
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,722
And you�re not thinking ahead.

715
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:18,750
Excuse me.

716
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:31,683
- Hi.
- Are you typing?

717
00:41:32,052 --> 00:41:33,358
- No.
- Yes, you are.

718
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,283
I thought we agreed you wouldn�t type while we talk.

719
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:38,458
Gotta break the rule just this once, I�m in a rush. It�s been a crazy couple of days.

720
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,585
Oh, school?

721
00:41:39,691 --> 00:41:43,115
Paper. Long story, I�ll fill you in in person. Where are you off to?

722
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:46,092
Luke�s! I have to un-stress him after his unhappy Gilmore outing.

723
00:41:46,148 --> 00:41:49,164
Dad tried to take over his whole life. He wants to franchise Luke�s.

724
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,732
- You�re kidding.
- Hey, do men shave anywhere except their faces?

725
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:55,267
- I don�t know, I�ve never lived with a man.
- Same here.

726
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:58,923
Well, if he does franchise the diner get him to put one near Yale. I miss those burgers.

727
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:00,135
He�s not franchising.

728
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:01,999
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

729
00:42:02,214 --> 00:42:04,380
- Do you think I�m too scared?
- What?

730
00:42:04,518 --> 00:42:07,590
Too scared, too timid. Do I take enough chances?

731
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:10,176
- What kind of chances?
- I don�t know, life chances.

732
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:11,947
- I think you do.
- I�m not a mouse?

733
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,073
Where is this coming from?

734
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,762
I don�t know, just something I�ve been thinking about lately.

735
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:19,770
Someone�s at the door. Um, say hi to Luke for me.

736
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:21,450
- If he�s out of comatose. By, honey.
- Bye.
