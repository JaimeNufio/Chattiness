1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,379
- How's the meal?
- Tasty.

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:05,714
Very tasty. New cook?

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,675
Yes, Marisella. She's introduced us
to some wonderful dishes...

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,719
so charmingly specific
to her native country.

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,639
- What country is she from?
- A little one, next to Mexico.

6
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,266
- How charmingly specific.
- Too bad Grandpa's not here.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,394
- He likes weird food.
- Where's he eating his weird food tonight?

8
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,355
- Argentina? Morocco?
- Akron.

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,648
- Ohio?
- Yes.

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,234
- Get out of here.
- I will not 'get out of here. '

11
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,236
No, I didn't mean really get out of here.

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,029
- Why is Grandpa in Akron?
- I don't know.

13
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,322
It was just a saying.

14
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,575
They sent him to deal with a problem
with their local office.

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,953
A saying, like 'save me,'
or 'get me out of here. '

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,829
Would you like a mirror in front of you...

17
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,082
so you can see yourself
during this conversation.

18
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,917
- Sorry. Dad's in Akron.
- Yes.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,838
The amenities are atrociously lacking.
He had to eat at a coffee shop last night.

20
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,090
The whole thing's insulting.
He's miserable.

21
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,217
- I hate that he's miserable.
- So do I.

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,427
- We ought to do something.
- Yes, I agree.

23
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,679
Warning, warning.

24
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,099
I'm glad you said that. I thought of
a wonderful way to cheer him up.

25
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,434
- Cool. What?
- Danger, Will Robinson, danger!

26
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,645
An oil portrait of you for his study.

27
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,189
- An oil portrait?
- I tried. Have fun.

28
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,900
It could hang right over his mantel.
He'd just love it.

29
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,110
I guess that would be okay.

30
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,071
- Mom, please don't make her do this.
- She just said she would.

31
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,366
Fine, but don't make her sit
and pose for it. Paint it from a photo.

32
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,870
- A photo? That's what they do at malls.
- I'll sit. It's fine.

33
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,415
Just because your experience was bad
doesn't mean Rory's has to be.

34
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,126
- What portrait? I haven't seen this.
- They never finished.

35
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,336
Three painters started,
and they all three quit.

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,505
- Why did they quit?
- She wouldn't stop scowling.

37
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,257
I was going for a Billy Idol thing.

38
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,342
The one from Italy
had some sort of breakdown.

39
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,678
It didn't hurt Van Gogh.
The guy should thank me.

40
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,056
A year later, I swear I saw him
rummaging through our recyclables.

41
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,684
Well, I'm happy to sit.
If it's for Grandpa, why not?

42
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,687
Wonderful. I'll set it up
first thing in the morning.

43
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,106
If you want, I can teach you the Billy Idol.

44
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,110
Most people focus on the lip thing,
but the eyes are just as important...

45
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,796
So, first thing you and Sookie would do
is incorporate.

46
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,297
Wow. Sounds so bigtime.

47
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,008
Not really. It just means
you're a single business entity.

48
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,010
You'll both be officers and shareholders...

49
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,304
and you'll get to
make up a name for your company.

50
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,640
I'm terrible at coming up with names.

51
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,476
When we first bought our house,
Rory and I wanted to name it.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,728
Like Jefferson
named his place Monticello...

53
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,856
but we could only come up with
'The Crap Shack. '

54
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,315
- Nice.
- Coffee?

55
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,900
Yeah, thanks.

56
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,112
- How are you, Jess?
- I'm not bleeding or anything.

57
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,989
Then it's gonna be a good day.

58
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,323
- 7:45.
- So?

59
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,827
You want me to go to school, or you want
to openly defy child-labor laws?

60
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,911
Go.

61
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:24,955
Stay out of trouble.

62
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,791
I guess I'll call off
the chickie run at the salt flats.

63
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,794
- Out!
- Wow. So much love.

64
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,838
Do you guys have a site in mind
for the inn?

65
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,047
- Yes.
- Great. Where?

66
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,216
You've seen pictures of it.
The Rachel property.

67
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,301
Right.

68
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,677
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

69
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,181
Rachel took the pictures, and the pictures
kind of got us into the place.

70
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,308
So we started calling it
the Rachel property...

71
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,060
because it made sense,
and then it became a habit.

72
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,147
Now, out of respect for you,
I'm gonna stop using her name...

73
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,859
and think of another name to call it.
Let's see. 'The Crap Shack' is taken.

74
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,485
It's okay. Call it what you want.

75
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,238
Who taught you
about all this business stuff? Your dad?

76
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,575
My dad didn't have a checking account
till I got taller than he was.

77
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,745
He bought this land with cash,
built this place himself.

78
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,039
Didn't have a bookkeeper,
accountant, or anything.

79
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,832
So you had no one showing you the ropes.

80
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,211
I figured I had to dive in on my own,
fail if that's my destiny...

81
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,089
- and forget what the experts say.
- That is exactly my philosophy. Exactly.

82
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,634
Except I'm not on my own,
I'm diving in with Sookie.

83
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,011
And failure is not even a choice
of destinies.

84
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,555
And I'm consulting any expert
who will listen to me.

85
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,349
Otherwise, it's identical.

86
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,477
I should be getting going.
You gonna write this meal off?

87
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,604
- Why?
- We talked business.

88
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,481
You gotta be thinking about these things.

89
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,359
No, I mean, 'Why? I'm not paying for it. '

90
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,736
- Exactly.
- You're gonna do fine.

91
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,906
It shouldn't be too flashy.

92
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,450
How about something historical,
like 'The Paul Revere'?

93
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,035
- That could work.
- What could work?

94
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,703
We're thinking up names for the inn.

95
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,456
If you want simple,
something like 'The Country Rose. '

96
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,541
That's pretty good.

97
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,085
We could line the front path
with multicolored roses.

98
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,878
Or 'The Inn by the Hollow. '

99
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,213
- Kind of long.
- But nice.

100
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,216
How about 'The Money Pit'?
Or 'The Outhouse'? Go international.

101
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,425
Go back in your hole.

102
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,262
Or 'The Inn Heading for Bankruptcy'?
Kind of long, but nice.

103
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,347
You who have no dreams,
rain on those who do.

104
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,600
I say this because I care about you.
It's risky, what you are doing.

105
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,727
Most new businesses
go down within two years.

106
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,437
I say if we go down after two years...

107
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,731
it'll be the most exciting two years
of our lives.

108
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,276
- Same here. Boredom stinks!
- Fine. Proceed blindly.

109
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,652
This came in 10 minutes ago.

110
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,571
It does not involve The Independence Inn.

111
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,699
Therefore, delivering it was
beyond my official obligations...

112
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,577
so I am taking an extra-long lunch break.

113
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,245
He's so genuine.

114
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,913
- Oh, my God.
- What?

115
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,041
It's the title search for
the Rachel property. Guess who owns it?

116
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,960
Tell me it's
not that bastard Donald Trump.

117
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,920
- Fran.
- Fran from Westin Bakery?

118
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,714
Sweet little Fran, the cupcake lady.

119
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,258
Not some cigar-chomping,
dirty-dealing city slicker.

120
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,636
That's good. Hey, 'The Country Slicker. '
Funny name, cutesy idea.

121
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,430
- It's a little much.
- It's way too much.

122
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,015
- I'll call Fran.
- 'Fran's Old Place. '

123
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,725
It'll be like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.

124
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,894
People will be
trying to figure out who Fran is.

125
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:56,398
Or 'The In Inn'
It's an inn that's in with the in-crowd.

126
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,985
- I'm gonna go sit down.
- Do that, sweetie.

127
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,629
Honey, I am so sorry.
Am I late-late, or just late?

128
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,506
Two pieces of carrot cake and a rum ball.

129
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,133
I'm so sorry.
I swear, I meant to be on time.

130
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,845
I was prepping the raspberry glaze
for tonight's dessert, and it struck me:

131
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:31,183
I made a blueberry glaze for the souffl�
I made last Tuesday, and this is Tuesday.

132
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,311
And a lot of locals come every week
on the same night every week.

133
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,022
And I just didn't want to serve them
a similar dessert...

134
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,149
even though
it's a completely different berry.

135
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,109
- I need another rum ball.
- I'm sorry.

136
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,111
No, you're a perfectionist.

137
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,281
And that attention to detail
is why people call you 'the maestro. '

138
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,910
- Really? Who calls me that?
- The people who eat the rum balls.

139
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,745
So, ladies, how are we doing here?

140
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,414
- We're doing great, Fran.
- That's wonderful.

141
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,875
Could Sookie and I talk to you
for a couple minutes?

142
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,545
Of course. Marjorie can handle things.

143
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,632
- Fran, are you okay?
- It's this bum hip.

144
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,218
It needs to be replaced. Again.

145
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,221
And I have this awful angina.

146
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,056
We're so sorry to hear that.

147
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,268
So, I know you didn't come here
to listen to me gripe...

148
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,019
so tell me what's on your mind.

149
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,522
Fran, we understand that you own...

150
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,733
the old Dragonfly bed-and-breakfast,
that whole property out there.

151
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,444
Yes, I do. It was my parents' business.

152
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,988
It's a beautiful place.

153
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,741
It used to be. But it's in such disarray now.

154
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,035
Yes, it is. That's kind of why we're here.

155
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,955
- We'd actually like to buy it.
- Buy the Dragonfly?

156
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,249
We'd like to buy it
and make it beautiful again...

157
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,543
and we're prepared
to make you an offer right now.

158
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,753
My, this is a surprise.

159
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,131
Sookie and I are going
to start our own inn...

160
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,717
and we've been searching
for the perfect place.

161
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,594
- Your own inn?
- Yeah.

162
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,929
How wonderful!

163
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,807
You are going to be so successful.

164
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,100
Thanks, sweetie.

165
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,769
That means so much,
like we have your blessing.

166
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,897
But I can't sell you the property.

167
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,064
- What?
- How come?

168
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,733
I just couldn't.

169
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,111
You know, I have no siblings
and no children...

170
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:10,824
and, in a way, that place
is really the only family I have.

171
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:15,704
I'm the last Westin left,
so I plan to own it forever.

172
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,748
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

173
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,667
- That's a very long time.
- A very long time.

174
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,544
I'm so sorry.

175
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,379
Fran, may I ask...

176
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,759
Go ahead, honey,
ask me anything you want.

177
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:33,055
What happens to the place if you...
If forever isn't quite forever?

178
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:37,851
I don't understand, dear.
All I know is that I can't sell the place.

179
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,811
No, I don't mean selling it.

180
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,190
I mean you would keep it forever,
but what happens...

181
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,985
once you're no longer in the position
of physically controlling the property?

182
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,320
How could that be?

183
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,990
- Well, if you...
- Take a long vacation.

184
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,660
- Yes, take a long vacation. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

185
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,872
And when you're on that vacation,
the property is just left sitting there.

186
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,417
- What happens then?
- I don't enjoy vacations.

187
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,213
I toured the California Gold Country
10 years ago.

188
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,507
It was hot, and the bus smelled.

189
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:13,345
Okay. I mean a longer vacation
than a trip to California.

190
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,931
- To a different place.
- What kind of place?

191
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,350
- A place out there.
- Way out there, Fran.

192
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,685
Europe?

193
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,981
- I mean, the ultimate long vacation.
- Yeah, Fran, see, eventually...

194
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,317
we're all gonna take
the same long vacation.

195
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,111
And with that being the case...

196
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,865
you might want to sell the property now
and enjoy the money.

197
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:37,369
I'm very sorry,
but I can never sell the place.

198
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,707
- Thanks for your time, Fran.
- Yeah, thanks, Fran.

199
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,876
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

200
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:52,759
You both look so sad.
Would you like a cupcake?

201
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,511
- Please.
- Yeah.

202
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,890
So, Janie Fertman's
trying to be my friend again.

203
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,892
Yikes. What kind of vibe
were you giving her?

204
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:03,395
My patented Keith Richards, circa 1969,
don't-mess-with-me vibe...

205
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:07,024
- with a 1000-yard Asian stare thrown in.
- That should do it.

206
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,276
What's happening up there?

207
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,321
Just try to calm down, Taylor.

208
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,574
- Calm down? Why should I calm down?
- Yeah, why should he calm down?

209
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,452
- I want action, not words!
- Yeah, action, not words.

210
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,454
Don't you need
to get back to your newsstand?

211
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,538
No, I'm all yours.

212
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,415
We'll get to the bottom of this, I promise.

213
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,168
A crime was committed
right in front of my store!

214
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,047
- We can't say that for sure yet.
- How come you can't say that for sure?

215
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,799
This is a police tape.
You're the police. You own the tape.

216
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,595
We've contacted everyone in the precinct.
No one knows anything about this.

217
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,932
What do I do? I've got
a dead body right in front of my store!

218
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,268
No, you have a chalk outline
of a dead body in front of your store.

219
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,270
- Meaning that there were two crimes.
- What?

220
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,396
What do you mean, 'What?'

221
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,774
Somebody got murdered,
then somebody stole the body.

222
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,442
It's open-and-shut. Bing, bang, boom!

223
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,945
- Is this your son?
- I should say not!

224
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,573
Look, my partner's doing a head count
to see if anybody in town is missing.

225
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,492
Until then, just hang tight.

226
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,827
What's going on?

227
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,163
I don't know. I got here,
and this is what I found.

228
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,541
I told him it looked fake,
but he didn't believe me.

229
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,459
And you have such an honest face.

230
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,294
He must not love me as much as you do.

231
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:12,089
Okay, you two are officially sickening.

232
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,301
Everyone's accounted for.
Looks like this is just an elaborate prank.

233
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,637
It looks so real.
Where'd they get the police tape?

234
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,763
Kids have their ways.

235
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,891
Who'd be depraved enough
to pull a stupid prank like this?

236
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,351
Hard to say.

237
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,822
You're not writing what you purchased
on the back of these receipts.

238
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,867
- Just put 'cooking spray and sponges. '
- Okay.

239
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,662
When an auditor wants to know why
you need such large amounts of those?

240
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,081
I drop my pencil,
and put the scoop-neck sweater...

241
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:48,584
that I'm making a mental note to wear,
to good use.

242
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,377
At least you've got a solid plan.

243
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,838
I had a dream last night about us and Fran.

244
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,964
What was it?

245
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,175
It was in the future, and we were all old:

246
00:11:56,216 --> 00:12:01,180
You, me, Rory, Jackson, Michel, everyone,
gray hair, walking around with canes...

247
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:04,558
and we're all kind of ailing.
I had those big cataract glasses on.

248
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,727
You were hard of hearing.
You kept going, 'Huh?'

249
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,396
- Attractive.
- It's you kids with your rock 'n' roll.

250
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,482
But what, ho! Here walks up Fran.
And guess what?

251
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,861
- She looks exactly the same, even better.
- That's not fair.

252
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,487
That woman is gonna live forever.

253
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,157
Not necessarily.
Did you look up angina? I forgot to.

254
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,325
Yeah, it's nothing major.

255
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,660
- Guys, stop talking like this.
- Like what?

256
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,579
We love Fran, remember? Fran is great.

257
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,164
No, of course we love Fran.

258
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,667
We just want to know
what God's plan is for her, that's all.

259
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:35,088
I would advise at least pretending
to look busy. The boss is here.

260
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,926
- You're kidding. When?
- I just spotted her walking in.

261
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,260
Let's go.

262
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,721
Mia!

263
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,265
My babies!

264
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,685
- Did we know you were coming?
- I didn't know.

265
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,689
- This isn't a surprise inspection?
- That's exactly what this is. Ready?

266
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,192
- You're too thin, as always.
- But we eat.

267
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,527
And you're both too beautiful.

268
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,780
We often feel guilty monopolizing
the amount of beauty we possess.

269
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,617
I don't see you enough,
which is my fault, so you both pass.

270
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,539
Michel. How nice to see you.

271
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,834
And look at that suit.
You are quite the dandy, aren't you?

272
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,420
I had a feeling that a lovely woman
was going to be visiting today...

273
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,340
so I decided I must look my best for her.

274
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,177
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch a word of that.
- He said he missed you.

275
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:27,099
You've been in the US quite some time.
Your enunciation should be better by now.

276
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,019
The customers
seem to understand me just fine.

277
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,773
I didn't get that, either.
Did you get the tapes I sent you?

278
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,526
You should hit the desk.
People are looking for help.

279
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,320
Right away. Mia, I...

280
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,285
So are you too busy
to sneak out with me for a walk?

281
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,037
- If it's okay with the boss.
- It's a demand at this point.

282
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,165
Let's go. Michel, hold down the fort.

283
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,251
It's a little slow now, so it's no problem.

284
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,171
He says he's never liked you
and that you're a problem.

285
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,047
I said no such thing!

286
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,718
I don't know where this hostility
comes from. Can we work this out?

287
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,469
There is nothing to work out.

288
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,930
- He told you to get out.
- I did not!

289
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,892
I don't know what I did
to make him hate me.

290
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:18,984
- Look at this place. Exactly the same.
- I made him paint it a few months ago.

291
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:23,113
Well, good for you. Nice to see you, Lucas.

292
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,657
You're the only person
that can call me that, Mia.

293
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:26,783
I know this.

294
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,077
I'm saying it for others
who plan to try it later.

295
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,787
Whatever, Lucas.

296
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,582
- Mia, you know anything about toasters?
- Not a damn thing.

297
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,668
Then, sit down
and let me get you some coffee.

298
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,297
So, Mia, how's living in Santa Barbara?

299
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,258
Horrible. Did you know the sun
shines all the time out there?

300
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:44,760
They've written songs about that.

301
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,472
No one told me that's how it was.
Half my wardrobe is obsolete.

302
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,934
- Drag. You know that blue coat?
- You're not getting it.

303
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,480
- You're making that worse.
- Big help. Thanks.

304
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,898
Luke's nephew.

305
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,817
- Luke, that's your nephew?
- It's Liz's kid.

306
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,904
Jess, this is Mia.
She owns the Independence Inn.

307
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,740
That's, 'Hello, nice to meet you,'
in slacker.

308
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,076
You don't need me down here, do you?

309
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,452
I'm sorry, Mia. He's just...

310
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:15,207
Please, forget it. You weren't exactly
talkative yourself when you were his age.

311
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,002
- That's right. You knew Luke as a boy.
- I can't imagine Luke as a boy.

312
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,379
Can we change the subject?

313
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,589
He would help people
carry groceries home.

314
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,342
- How very Boy Scouty of you.
- For a quarter a bag.

315
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,970
How very John Birch Society of you.

316
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,055
He was never without his skateboard
for a time.

317
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,182
- Were you any good?
- I could hold my own.

318
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,435
There was that year you wore
the same shirt everywhere you went.

319
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,771
- I don't remember that.
- Maybe something flannel.

320
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,732
No, it was from that TV show,
that famous one.

321
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,318
- It's not important.
- Star Trek. That's it.

322
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,571
- Oh, my God.
- Stop it.

323
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,990
- You were a Trekkie?
- I was not a Trekkie.

324
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:51,910
I believe denying you were a Trekkie
is a violation of the Prime Directive.

325
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,203
Indubitably, Captain.

326
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,789
It was a gift from my aunt.
I wore it to make her happy.

327
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,875
I've never wanted
to make any aunt that happy.

328
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,461
- Did I say something I shouldn't have?
- I have to cancel everything...

329
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:05,340
scheduled for the next three months,
'cause I'll still be laughing my ass off.

330
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,552
- Luke, I need to talk to you right now.
- What is it, Taylor?

331
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,430
I have conducted a thorough investigation
of all the people...

332
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,391
who may have inadvertently been witness
to the phony murder...

333
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,018
at my store last night.

334
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,728
There was a phony murder?

335
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,771
The town's too dull
to work up a real murder.

336
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,150
You're one 'Beam me up, Scotty'
reference away from being the victim.

337
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,903
- Are you gonna listen?
- What's this got to do with me?

338
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:30,532
Three people have reported seeing Jess in
that area late last night, skulking, lurking.

339
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,451
There were a lot of people out last night.

340
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,662
I fed them. I'll give you their names
to add to your suspect list.

341
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,625
A person witnessed Jess walking out
of an arts-and-crafts store two days ago...

342
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,794
- with what appeared to be chalk.
- You appear to be bugging me.

343
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,963
- What are you gonna do about it?
- About what?

344
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,509
- About the results of my investigation.
- Nothing, but thanks for the info.

345
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,928
You have to do something.
People want action.

346
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,514
- People? Meaning you.
- Not just me.

347
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:56,308
I speak for the Stars Hollow
Business Association...

348
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,436
the Stars Hollow Tourist Board,
Neighborhood Watch Organization...

349
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,481
and the Stars Hollow Citizens
for a Clean Stars Hollow Council.

350
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,317
- All of which are you.
- So are you going to act?

351
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,946
- I'm gonna act like you never came in here.
- Fine, have it your own way.

352
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:12,991
But I warn you, there's gonna be a lot
of unhappy people at the SHBA...

353
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:17,871
the SHTB, the SHMWO, and the SHCCHSC.

354
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,164
F- I-N-E!

355
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,501
You are impossible!

356
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,382
- Hi, Mia.
- Nice to see you, Taylor.

357
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:35,639
I've got to get out of Santa Barbara.
I miss the small-town theater.

358
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,683
And I miss you.

359
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:41,186
Do you realize it was 15 years ago,
almost to the day?

360
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,521
- Yes, it was.
- What was?

361
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:46,316
To the day when this skinny
little teenage girl showed up at the inn.

362
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,652
She had this tiny little thing in her arms.

363
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,489
- A little thing named Rory.
- Okay, no physical re-enactment.

364
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,992
You marched up to me,
looked me in the eye, and said:

365
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,952
'I'm here for a job. Any job. '

366
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,247
Well, IBM had turned me down
for the CEO slot, so I was desperate.

367
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,709
Work experience, none.
Recommendations, none. Skills...

368
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,837
Besides flawlessly applying mascara
in a moving car, none.

369
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,798
Not one thing to recommend hiring her.
Just that...

370
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:13,969
How do I put it and remain a lady?
That 'who cares?' look in her eye.

371
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,139
So I gave her any job.
The other maids hated you.

372
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,850
- Well, they were so slow.
- You were special.

373
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,894
Why don't you move back here?
We miss you.

374
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,521
Or at least visit more.
You never come at all.

375
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,940
I don't have to.
You've made me redundant.

376
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,234
- I have not.
- Don't be humble.

377
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,069
The inn is beyond covered.

378
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,655
It's never run this well
or been this successful.

379
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,574
That inn is like your place now.

380
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,452
Without you, I wouldn't know
what to do. I'd be lost.

381
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,995
Lost, yeah.

382
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,749
- You look sad now. Why?
- Nothing.

383
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,632
In all the excitement,
I hadn't thought about telling Mia.

384
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,009
- What is wrong with me?
- Nothing is wrong with you.

385
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,428
I feel terrible.
I should have told her before.

386
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:59,014
I should have told her
the day the idea occurred to us.

387
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:02,059
She deserved that.
After all she's done for me.

388
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,146
- Hello?
- Lorelai, your daughter's being impossible.

389
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,733
- She won't pose in an appropriate manner.
- I'm trying to, Grandma.

390
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,277
- It's just awkward.
- Let me guess how you're posing her.

391
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,196
She's in a silly gown, on a silly chair...

392
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,406
with both of her hands raised
in some silly way.

393
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,159
Just the one hand is raised,
and none of it's silly.

394
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,619
Pick a simpler pose.

395
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,121
This is the simplest,
and it wasn't my choice.

396
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,623
And your choice is?

397
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,709
I wanted the swan to sit regally
aside Rory's throne.

398
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,419
Swan? Throne?

399
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,630
Now you have a problem
with swans and thrones.

400
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:35,467
Because swans and thrones scream
one thing, Mom: Siegfried and Roy.

401
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,885
- Who?
- Make a change, Mom.

402
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,471
I suppose you'd have her in the chair,
reading a book.

403
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,390
Now, that sounds great.

404
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,517
- Be serious.
- I am!

405
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,769
That's a completely natural pose for Rory.

406
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:49,147
And a painting of her reading
that's gonna be hung in Dad's study...

407
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,899
seems just crazy enough to work.

408
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,111
Maybe it's not such a bad idea.

409
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,446
Give it a try, and let her lower her arm.

410
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,907
- Rory, you can lower your arm.
- Thanks.

411
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,704
I think he's just hungry.
We're going to lose the swan!

412
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,831
Good going, Mom. Bye.

413
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,710
So, how do I do this?

414
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:13,630
- How do I tell Mia that I'm leaving?
- Get her drunk first?

415
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:17,634
I can't believe it. I'm gonna let down
the one person in my life...

416
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,012
who was there for me
when I needed it the most.

417
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,599
I wanted to put it on the front desk,
but I think it might be a tad short.

418
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:27,144
We could get a carpenter to build up
a base and raise it up two inches...

419
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:30,022
- and then it would be perfect.
- Great idea.

420
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,275
- I got that, every word!
- Yes!

421
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,402
I'm so proud.

422
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,364
So, you gonna tell her now or later?

423
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:43,577
Later, because she's so happy
that she can finally understand Michel...

424
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,122
and that the lamp is fixed and...
And that, too.

425
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,500
- We're late.
- We're not late.

426
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,002
Last time, Taylor said
there would be consequences.

427
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,546
No, he said there would be
severe consequences.

428
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:55,797
What time is it? Are we late?

429
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,216
- I hope so.
- Mia?

430
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,636
I'm sorry, but it's been two years
since I've been to a town meeting...

431
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,638
and I want some controversy.

432
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,224
Jeez! Don't sneak up on me like that.

433
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:08,602
Yeah, boy, I was lucky
you had your phasers on stun.

434
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,021
At least we're not late. Luke's never late.

435
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,733
- Actually, we're two minutes early.
- We should get a prize for being on time.

436
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:18,195
Luke, let's go back to the diner
and get some pie as our reward.

437
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,864
- Then you'd be late.
- A funny conundrum, but I want pie.

438
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,242
- You're harassing me now.
- I'm not harassing you.

439
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,535
We're your groupies.

440
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:28,038
- 'Luke, you're so dreamy. Be my guy. '
- 'No, be my guy. '

441
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,666
I'm bringing up the need
for more police protection.

442
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,128
I think we're late.

443
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,047
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

444
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,467
Meeting was supposed to start at 8:00.
It's a minute to 8:00.

445
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:43,762
- You might as well be honest with him.
- Honest about what?

446
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,265
If you must know,
there was a special issue...

447
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,433
the business community
had to deal with first...

448
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:49,977
so we decided to start early.

449
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,689
I'm in the business community,
and I wasn't told about it.

450
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:57,651
- Taylor?
- All right, fine! You weren't invited, Luke.

451
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,362
- And why is that?
- Controversy.

452
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,699
You weren't invited because
we are dealing with the Jess situation.

453
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,117
The Jess situation?

454
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,871
If this was the Wild West, we'd be diving
into the water trough about now.

455
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:09,955
Damn it, Taylor!

456
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,500
- Luke, honey, calm down.
- After all, this is all your doing.

457
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,878
If you hadn't so cavalierly dismissed
the issue...

458
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,296
we wouldn't have had to do this.

459
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,299
I lost business because of
what your hooligan nephew did.

460
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,800
How was business lost, Taylor?

461
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:25,053
If you opened late that day,
your customers just came back later.

462
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:29,308
Not so. When Mrs. Lanahan couldn't buy
her head of lettuce for her lunch...

463
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:33,145
she drove straight to Woodbury
to buy lettuce from a competing market.

464
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,272
Isn't that right, Mrs. Lanahan?

465
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,986
You really shouldn't be driving anymore.

466
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,239
Word has it that she was telling
other Doose's Market shoppers...

467
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:47,951
that Woodbury lettuce is crisper.
That's business flying out the door.

468
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,287
Fine. How much is a head of lettuce? $1?

469
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:51,955
Let's go crazy. Give me five heads.

470
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,000
This goes well beyond a head of lettuce,
young man.

471
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,002
The charges against your nephew
are numerous.

472
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,421
- He stole 'Save the Bridge' money.
- He gave it back.

473
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,257
- Stole a gnome from Babette's garden.
- Pierpont was returned.

474
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:06,553
- He hooted at one of my dance classes.
- He took a garden hose from my yard.

475
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:09,348
My son said he set off the fire alarms
at school last week.

476
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,684
I heard he controls the weather
and wrote the screenplay to Glitter!

477
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,604
- I think it's time for me to pipe in.
- Yeah, that'll be good.

478
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:18,524
I have every right, Luke.
I'm a local entrepreneur.

479
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:22,027
You took over your father's newsstand.
Doesn't make you an entrepreneur.

480
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,029
You took over
your old man's hardware store.

481
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:27,533
- And turned it into a diner.
- Big whoop! Who can't fry an egg?

482
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,117
Let's keep things moving here, boys.

483
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,995
I never liked the look of that kid
from the second I saw him.

484
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,081
- Unbelievable!
- Excuse me, I've got the floor.

485
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,792
- You don't have the floor.
- I'm standing, aren't I?

486
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,211
I was standing first,
which means I have the floor...

487
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,672
- and I'm not giving it to you.
- What is with you two?

488
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,049
This goes way beyond
the Jess matter, Taylor.

489
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:47,344
Luke's been on me since first grade,
when he wrongfully accused me...

490
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:50,222
of sabotaging a clay imprint
that he made of his hand.

491
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,391
Think hard. Was he dressed like Sulu?

492
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,893
No one cares about
the stupid clay hand, Bootsy!

493
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,312
And you stomped on it,
and three kids saw you!

494
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,522
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

495
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:00,691
- No, I didn't.
- Boys, please!

496
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:04,319
The bottom line here is that there is
a consensus among townspeople...

497
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:08,240
who are in agreement that Stars Hollow
was a better place before Jess got here.

498
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:11,368
This half of the room gets the tar,
the other gets the feathers?

499
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,246
There hasn't been any talk
of tar and feathers, although...

500
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:16,665
Look, I've lived in this town
my entire life...

501
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,375
longer than most everybody here.

502
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,419
Beg to differ.
I'm five weeks older than you.

503
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,045
That means I've been here longer.

504
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,339
I've never bothered anyone,
I've kept to myself...

505
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:25,841
and I've done the best I could.

506
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,510
I pay my taxes,
and I help people when I can.

507
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:31,638
I haven't pitched in on the decorative,
pageantry town stuff...

508
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:35,434
because it all seems insane to me,
but I don't get in the way of that, either!

509
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,436
- What's your point, Luke?
- His point is...

510
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,188
- Do you mind?
- Be my guest.

511
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:42,441
- If there's a problem...
- And I'm not saying there's a problem.

512
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,110
Right. But if there is,
give him time to deal with it...

513
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,029
before you storm his diner.

514
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:51,116
Right, what I'm dealing with, being
a problem that I don't necessarily agree...

515
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,784
that I even have!

516
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,078
- Right.
- I didn't get that last part.

517
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,331
Lay off him,
because what you're all doing stinks.

518
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,917
I'm done here. I'm done with all of you.

519
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,587
I was gonna stay open later in case anyone
wanted to eat after the meeting.

520
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,047
Forget that.

521
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,301
His turkey burgers are very dry.

522
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,096
Well, I must say, that was quite exciting.

523
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:16,308
A little disturbing.
I think the whole town needs a field trip.

524
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,310
- You think Luke's okay?
- I think he will be.

525
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:19,895
Just needs to cool off a little.

526
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,313
I'm gonna go check on Dean.

527
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:24,066
He's been scraping the outline
off the cement for two days.

528
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,527
Good idea.
There's nothing like your face on his...

529
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,487
to make the cleaning process go faster.

530
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,948
- She's all yours, Mia.
- I'll take her.

531
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,282
Bye, hon.

532
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,661
I am just having the most wonderful time.

533
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:40,624
And I am so proud of you and Rory.
You both have just come so far.

534
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,292
Yeah, we have.

535
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:48,674
- I need to talk to you about something.
- Of course. What is it, honey?

536
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:53,095
It's really hard, and I should have
brought it up ages ago...

537
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,764
but Sookie and I
are thinking of making a change.

538
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,099
A change?

539
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,768
We're going to open our own inn.

540
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:04,439
We've talked about it for a long time,
and it seems like the time is right.

541
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:07,901
I love the Independence Inn,
and Sookie loves it, too.

542
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,362
- And we both love you so much.
- I know.

543
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:13,490
But it just feels like something
we need to do.

544
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,660
- You hate me.
- No, I don't.

545
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:19,288
I'm letting you down.
I'm walking out. Being ungrateful.

546
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,831
Lorelai, stop.

547
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:24,376
Do you think I was naive enough to think
that you'd work for me forever?

548
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:27,713
You and Sookie have more talent
for this business than I do...

549
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,464
and I'm very good.

550
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,259
You're going to open an incredible place.

551
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:36,847
And if you don't let me help you
in any way I can, then I'll be very mad.

552
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:39,892
Of course we need your help.
We'd be lost without your help.

553
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:44,271
Good. I was just wondering,
what's the time frame for this big move?

554
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,899
We're waiting
for this perfect location to free up.

555
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,359
But you'll have plenty of notice...

556
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,862
and I'll be there to find replacements
and train them.

557
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,031
That's very sweet of you,
but I'm wondering...

558
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,283
if you could make it sooner
rather than later.

559
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,367
What?

560
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:01,455
Your leaving gives me the perfect excuse
to finally sell the place.

561
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,581
Sell the place?

562
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:07,377
I get offers all the time, lucrative ones,
but I never even considered it because...

563
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,964
Of course I love the inn,
but I couldn't do that to you.

564
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:14,927
And now that you have this big change
coming up in your life...

565
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,387
it might be time for one in mine.

566
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,933
Good.

567
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:25,562
- Then it all works out good.
- Actually, it's very good.

568
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:29,942
Okay. Well, good.

569
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:55,133
So, I'm working on the menu
for the Duncan wedding.

570
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,261
- I can't read that.
- I know.

571
00:27:57,302 --> 00:28:00,556
I had it all typed up neat to begin with,
but on the drive to work...

572
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,267
I got an inspiration.
I started writing in the new stuff.

573
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,644
And it ain't easy writing and driving.

574
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:08,856
- I can't read that. What is that?
- I can't read that, either.

575
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:12,442
I'll just get you a new one.
How did your talk with Mia go?

576
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:15,112
Fine. Good. She took it
like you said she would: Classy.

577
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,739
She is classy. Good. That's a relief.

578
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:20,242
It's a relief, right?
You said she took it good?

579
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,286
- Yes, she did.
- But you look upset.

580
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,164
- She's gonna sell the inn.
- You're kidding.

581
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:29,376
She says gets offers, and
this might be fortuitous timing for her.

582
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,587
Well, great. Everybody wins.

583
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,299
That's good. Look happy.
Okay, this does not look happy.

584
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,092
I don't understand how she can do this.

585
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,844
- What's the big deal?
- The big deal is...

586
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,637
she's not gonna sell it to another Mia.

587
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,390
It's gonna be a big chain,
they'll come marching in...

588
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,476
with their business models,
and their architects and designers...

589
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,230
change everything, the place will lose
all its personality and charm.

590
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:53,650
I hope they don't,
but our place is gonna be full of charm.

591
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,110
You don't care what happens here?

592
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:58,822
Of course I do. But it's not up to me.
I can't control that.

593
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:01,909
The only thing we can control
is what our inn's gonna be like.

594
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,577
- I guess.
- You guess what?

595
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,078
- We'll see.
- We'll see what?

596
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:09,041
It's shortsighted to write off this place
when we haven't even bought Fran's yet.

597
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,669
- And we don't know if we will.
- We don't? Why wouldn't we?

598
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,881
Is this about Fran's life expectancy...

599
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:19,593
No, Sookie, it's about the fact
that we haven't looked at other places.

600
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,847
And we don't know if that's the right one.
We have to be very practical about this.

601
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:26,183
But it's the perfect location.
We all said so.

602
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:29,353
You can't get emotionally attached
to our decisions about the inn.

603
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,563
This is business.
You've got to stay detached.

604
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,982
But we're all so not detached.

605
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,985
- Do you have another location in mind?
- Not really.

606
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,862
Wanna look for a new location?

607
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,157
Yeah, like I have all this time
to go looking for other locations.

608
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,368
I don't know.
Should we try to buy this place?

609
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,578
This place is five times
what we can afford.

610
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:49,665
- So what do we do?
- I don't know. It's on hold, I guess.

611
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:52,417
It's been on hold for years.
We were moving forward.

612
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,962
I'm looking at the economy right now...

613
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,256
and I don't know if the timing's good.

614
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:00,300
That's not fair because I don't know
anything about the economy.

615
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,220
Good you hooked up with me,
because it's not looking good.

616
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:05,264
- Okay, what happened?
- What do you mean?

617
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,307
We had a vision, we had a plan.

618
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:09,601
You're the one
that got this ball rolling again...

619
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:12,938
and then I jump on the ball,
we're rolling on the ball together...

620
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,691
then you hopped off the ball,
and I'm still on the ball!

621
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:20,279
I'm confused, because I see our vision.
And you saw it, too, up until today.

622
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:23,115
Well, I know you would like things
to be simple...

623
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,701
but unfortunately,
things are more complicated.

624
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:28,245
That's why we'd be partners.
If something gets heavy...

625
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:30,372
the other one's there to pick up the slack.

626
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:33,292
Yes, well, that's great in theory,
but I've got to tell you...

627
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:36,295
my back is aching
from all the slack I'm taking up.

628
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:39,590
- What did I do that's so wrong?
- Let's not get into this stuff!

629
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,258
No, get into it!

630
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,219
You're not the most reliable person
in the world.

631
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:46,638
- Or the most punctual.
- You've always known that.

632
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,391
But getting into business, it's not so cute.

633
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,935
It could hurt us.
You were late for the Fran meeting.

634
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,314
You're constantly changing menus,
even after you've started making it.

635
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:58,775
I don't believe this. Before, it was kudos
for attention to detail.

636
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:01,945
- I was 'the maestro. '
- That's fine for an established place...

637
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,406
but you do that at our place,
it could wipe us out.

638
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,992
Profit margins in a new business are slim.

639
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:11,330
- Stop! Now you're talking down to me.
- I'm trying to explain.

640
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:15,000
Yes, and I don't know why you are,
but I don't want to start crying...

641
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,628
because it'll give you
one more thing to point at...

642
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:21,006
to say, 'She's too emotional and weak
to go into business with. '

643
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,174
So I'm leaving.

644
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:25,719
And I'll see you tomorrow,
if I can remember to show up.

645
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:32,476
- I've got to drop by the market.
- But it's your day off.

646
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,977
It's to get my paycheck.

647
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,563
If I don't get it by 4:00,
Taylor locks it in a safe.

648
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:37,814
It's on some kind of timer.

649
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:41,318
When I complain, he lectures me
on promptly putting checks in the bank...

650
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:45,197
and my head hurts from all the
nodding I do, even though I don't listen...

651
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,408
- Go.
- I'll just be a minute.

652
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:55,499
Should you be standing here all alone?

653
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:58,377
- I hear this is a dangerous corner.
- I'm fine.

654
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:01,004
- Feeling succinct today?
- Pretty much.

655
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:03,966
- Did I do something to offend?
- Me? No.

656
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,844
- Ask that same question to Luke.
- Meaning?

657
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:09,888
- You've got this whole town down on him.
- How did I do that?

658
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,348
You know how.

659
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,725
I'm familiar with the blue-book laws
in this town...

660
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,727
you could be talking about a lot of things.

661
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,855
Dropping a gum wrapper,
strolling arm in arm...

662
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,941
with a member of the opposite sex
on a Sunday.

663
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,194
What about it?

664
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,280
You did it.
The whole town knows you did it.

665
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:29,908
- They had a meeting about it.
- You actually went to that?

666
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,661
Those things are so To Kill a Mockingbird.

667
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,496
Yes, I went, and Luke went.

668
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,665
When he got there,
they ganged up on him.

669
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,876
- They all want you gone.
- Bummer.

670
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:43,463
And he's defending you and paying Taylor
back for his lettuce losses.

671
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:46,800
- His what?
- Now Luke's a pariah, all because of you.

672
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,345
What a shock.
You don't care about any of this.

673
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,014
I didn't say that.

674
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:55,225
- Go. I'm tired of talking to you.
- Fine.

675
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,439
You care nothing
about Luke and his feelings!

676
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,732
You got a second wind?

677
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:05,235
All he does is stick up for you,
and all you do is make his life harder!

678
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,031
You have to when you're trying
to be Holden Caulfield, but I think it stinks.

679
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:13,535
Luke has done a lot for my mom and me,
and I don't like to see him attacked.

680
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,537
Okay, second wind over.

681
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,874
Didn't know they were hard on him.

682
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,251
I never pegged you as clueless.
My mistake.

683
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,587
Okay, I get it.

684
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,756
I do, I get it.

685
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,969
Don't you at least think it was funny?

686
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:36,308
- That is so not the point.
- Yeah, you thought it was funny.

687
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,851
I got it.

688
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:41,897
Dean, I don't think you two have met.

689
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,566
- This is Jess. This is Dean.
- Boyfriend?

690
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,069
- Of course.
- Sorry. You didn't say.

691
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,946
- How you doing?
- Good.

692
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:54,243
- Okay, see you around.
- Seems to turn out that way, doesn't it?

693
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,126
Is Grandpa still in Akron?

694
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:06,296
For Akron's sake,
I hope he's moved on to Boise.

695
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:12,010
Hi, we're the daughter
and the granddaughter.

696
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,596
- You are majorly crabby.
- I just have a headache.

697
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,725
Good! Come. It's all done, and it's great.

698
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,984
- What do you think?
- It's freaky.

699
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:30,237
- Freaky?
- Just seeing me up on the wall like that.

700
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,823
I like it, though. It's good, I guess.

701
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:35,534
I should take myself out
of the judging process.

702
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:38,954
I think Richard's gonna love it.
It's perfect. Don't you think?

703
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,957
- It turned out better than you thought.
- Yeah.

704
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,835
Come on. Say a little more than that.

705
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,213
It's great, Mom.
It's just a notch below Rembrandt.

706
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,674
You don't have to take that attitude.

707
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:54,344
I'd light some sparklers
and jump up and down, yelling 'yay'...

708
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:57,264
but I'm out of sparklers,
and my feet hurt too much to jump.

709
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:02,269
But next week, when I have more energy,
I'll write a love song for the chandelier!

710
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,104
Mom.

711
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:13,238
How dare you walk away from me
when I'm being a world-class jerk to you?

712
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:17,242
- The painting's great, Mom, really.
- Thank you.

713
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,869
I really like it.

714
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:21,872
It's so natural that she's reading,
which is great.

715
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:26,210
She's not sitting next to a goose,
which is good, and Dad is gonna love it.

716
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,128
It's a good thing you did here.

717
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:32,591
You can be so harsh, and I don't know
where it comes from, or what I've done.

718
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:35,344
- You did nothing.
- I must have done something.

719
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:37,721
It's just been a bad week.

720
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:41,934
Sookie and I were moving forward
with plans to open our inn...

721
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,477
and we had a huge fight.

722
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,146
We've never had a huge fight,
let alone a fight.

723
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,650
Awful things were said. It started
when Mia showed up for a visit...

724
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:51,777
and I told her about our plans.

725
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,198
She's talking about selling the
Independence Inn, and it wigged me out.

726
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:58,283
It's stupid. I don't know.

727
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,912
But it was our home for so long,
mine and Rory's.

728
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,957
It's just weird to think
that it wouldn't be there...

729
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:08,210
and Mia wouldn't be there,
and I wouldn't be there.

730
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:12,548
And I just got very upset.
Anyway, I'm rambling.

731
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,301
The painting is really great.

732
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,681
Will you accept my apology?

733
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:24,434
Yes, I will. I've had bad days, too.

734
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:28,272
- Thank you.
- We should get back to Rory.

735
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:35,612
- Okay, I'm pretty much done.
- Thanks for doing this.

736
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:38,490
I didn't want the rain
to destroy your beautiful chuppah...

737
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:42,161
I looked in the yellow pages, and
didn't see a chuppah waterproofer listing.

738
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:44,538
How about
chuppah-goat-figure repairman?

739
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:45,914
- Gilbert.
- What?

740
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,625
We named the goat Gilbert.
He's headless. Can you fix him?

741
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:51,378
- Yeah, I got some glue here. I can fix him.
- Good.

742
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:52,880
I'll make some tea.

743
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:55,841
So, Sookie stopped at the diner
this morning.

744
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:59,136
I asked her
how your plans were going at the new inn.

745
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:02,431
She awkwardly changed the subject
to women's basketball.

746
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,766
She's never shown much interest
in sports before.

747
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,059
What's going on with that?

748
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,937
Women's basketball
is getting super popular.

749
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:12,316
That's good, I think.
The tall girls need an outlet.

750
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,985
We had a fight. A big, humongous fight.

751
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,738
- She's never gonna speak to me again.
- What happened?

752
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:21,658
I just flat-out panicked about the enormity
of what we were getting into...

753
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,329
and it clobbered me,
and I clobbered Sookie. I'm such a jerk.

754
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,915
- If I cry, will it freak you out?
- Totally.

755
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:29,917
- If I whimper?
- How about you suck it up?

756
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,711
- I'll try.
- You're as ready as you've ever been.

757
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:37,132
Luke, do not underestimate
the total lack of confidence...

758
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:38,383
I have in my abilities.

759
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:41,303
You're the most confident person I know,
obnoxiously so.

760
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,180
- Thank you.
- I mean in a good way.

761
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:47,351
- You're good at what you do.
- I'm good at doing what I have to do.

762
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,269
When I had to get a job, I got it.

763
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,480
When I had to find a house, I got it.

764
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,815
When I had to get Rory into Chilton,
I did it.

765
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:55,984
But I don't have to leave
the Independence Inn.

766
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,028
I don't have to go into business for myself.

767
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,863
I don't have to walk out on that limb...

768
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:03,116
- and risk everything I've worked for.
- Don't do it.

769
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:05,327
- What?
- Just stay where you are.

770
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,579
What is this, reverse psychology?

771
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:10,249
No, just stay at the inn.
You're happy there.

772
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:13,001
- So you think I can't hack it?
- Of course you can hack it.

773
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:17,756
- Great, lip service. That's what I need.
- If I start to cry, will that freak you out?

774
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,551
I couldn't stay where I am if I wanted.

775
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:22,636
Mia is selling the inn...

776
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,931
and that hit me hard, too,
maybe harder than the other thing.

777
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,558
I'm gonna be without a home.

778
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,351
What do you mean? This is your home.

779
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:33,272
No, I mean a home-home,
a memory home.

780
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:36,859
The inn is where Rory took her first step.

781
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:38,944
It's where I took my first step.

782
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:41,697
It's more of a home to me
than my parents' house ever was.

783
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,159
You're scared, like everybody else
when they're taking on something big.

784
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,536
What does everybody do
to get through this feeling?

785
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:52,249
They run in the back, throw up, pass out,
then smack their head on the floor.

786
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,376
I did that on the morning
I opened the diner.

787
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,712
There is no button to push
to get you through this.

788
00:38:56,795 --> 00:39:00,757
You've just got to jump in and be scared
and stick with it until it gets fun.

789
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:04,344
- How long till the diner got fun?
- About a year.

790
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:07,139
- And there's no button? Can I pull a lever?
- No.

791
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:08,390
- Turn a knob?
- No.

792
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,684
- You just jump?
- You just jump.

793
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:14,104
- I want to do it.
- You should do it.

794
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,898
Check it out.

795
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:18,734
- Gilbert, you're not worse for the wear.
- I'll reattach him.

796
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:20,319
How did this happen, anyway?

797
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,529
Something must've smacked into it
with a hedger.

798
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:26,492
Well, now no one will ever know.
Women's basketball is in season.

799
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:28,494
You might want to run
that news past Sookie.

800
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:30,496
Maybe you can go to a game
or something.

801
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:33,707
Yeah, or something. Thanks.

802
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,340
Hi.

803
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:47,137
Meatloaf, mashed potatoes,
stuffing: Comfort food?

804
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:49,181
It would be good
with the weather changing.

805
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:51,850
If you don't think it's right,
I can make something else.

806
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:56,480
Although I'm on-schedule and on-budget,
so a change would throw things off.

807
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,857
No, everything looks great.

808
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,028
- Sookie.
- Yeah?

809
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,823
I'm sorry about what happened.

810
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:08,534
I said stupid things,
and I said them for reasons...

811
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:11,537
that have nothing to do with you,
I hate myself for doing it...

812
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,413
and I know you do, too, and I am sorry.

813
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,374
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

814
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,252
You are a brilliant chef
and to do things differently...

815
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:20,379
from how you do them now is ridiculous.

816
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:23,507
You don't tell a great violinist
to hold his bow differently.

817
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,469
You don't tell a great cymbal player
to crash his cymbals differently.

818
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:30,514
- There are great cymbal players?
- Theoretically.

819
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:34,268
- Okay, well, it's okay.
- I want to go ahead with our plans.

820
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,854
Forget my freakout.
Pretend it didn't happen.

821
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,689
Let's move forward.

822
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,901
- You don't want to move forward?
- I do, but I need your promise...

823
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:45,445
- you're not gonna lose it on me again.
- I promise.

824
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:48,031
'Cause I couldn't take
losing a business partner...

825
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:51,160
and my best friend in one fell swoop.
It'd be too much.

826
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:54,538
I will place my hand
on whatever you want and swear...

827
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,708
that you can trust that
I will not lose confidence in our dream.

828
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,794
That's enough. I know you don't like
to put your hand on things.

829
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:02,629
We're gonna give it our best shot.

830
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:04,339
And if we go down after two years...

831
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:07,551
It'll be the most exciting
two years of our lives.

832
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:08,927
How about antiques?

833
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,221
Absolutely. It's the best place for antiques.

834
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:13,599
Michel will have a map for you
if you need it.

835
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,017
Thank you.

836
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:17,853
- Hello. Can I help you?
- No, thank you. I just...

837
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:18,979
Yes?

838
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:22,983
I just wanted to meet the woman
who helped raise my daughter.

839
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,652
- Emily.
- Yes, I'm Emily Gilmore.

840
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:28,614
I've wanted to meet you, too,
for a very long time.

841
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,908
- That's nice.
- Would you like to sit down?

842
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:34,328
- Have lunch with me, won't you?
- No, thank you.

843
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:37,956
You have a lovely place here.
It's a beautiful hotel.

844
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:42,252
- Not a home, but still a beautiful hotel.
- Sometimes home is where your hat is.

845
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:45,297
- Or where your family is.
- Yes, that, too.

846
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,674
You sure you don't want some tea?

847
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:50,052
Tea usually makes things like this
less awkward.

848
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:51,595
There's things to hold and stir.

849
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,139
- I don't know why I came here.
- You wanted to meet me.

850
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,099
After all these years, it makes no sense.

851
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:59,102
- I expected you to come eventually.
- Did you?

852
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:02,689
And what did you expect to say to me
when I did come?

853
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:05,275
When Lorelai showed up
on my porch that day...

854
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,654
with a tiny baby in her arms,
I thought to myself:

855
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,531
'What if this were my daughter...

856
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:14,076
'and she was cold and scared
and needed a place to live?

857
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:16,078
'What would I want for her?'

858
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,622
And then I thought,
'I'd want her to find somebody...

859
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:22,251
'to take her in and make her safe
and help her find her way. '

860
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,794
That's funny.

861
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,965
I would've wanted her to find someone
who would send her home.

862
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,175
I have to go.

863
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:32,970
I'd appreciate
if you didn't mention this to Lorelai.

864
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,263
I won't.

865
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:43,355
Do you have pictures? From back then?

866
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:46,358
I'll send you a boxful tomorrow.

867
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:49,653
Thank you.

868
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:58,120
Man, it's such a relief
to have that Sookie thing fixed.

869
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:00,956
- I hate fighting with friends.
- That's what enemies are for.

870
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,666
God knows we have our share of those.

871
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:05,043
People who eat crunchy food
with their mouths open.

872
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:06,587
People who dog-ear library books.

873
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,339
- People who spit when they talk.
- You got me in the eye!

874
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,425
- You totally did.
- You're full of it.

875
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:12,634
Luke, where's my toast?

876
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:16,054
It's gonna take a while.
My big toaster's broken, so I got stuck...

877
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:19,433
with just this dinky one.
How did that happen?

878
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:21,685
- You're gonna break that.
- It was broken before.

879
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:22,769
It must've got better.

880
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,980
Inanimate objects don't usually get better.

881
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:26,899
- Did you fix this?
- Please.

882
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:30,235
I have no idea what you're babbling about.
I don't fix things.

883
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,571
- But yesterday...
- I've got school.

884
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:27,918
English
