1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,617
Previously on Gilmore Girls.

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:05,118
- She's not here yet.
- All right.

3
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:07,287
You'll have to entertain me
until she arrives.

4
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:10,206
- Okay, burger boy, dance.
- Will you marry me?

5
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:12,625
- What?
- Looking for something to shut you up.

6
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,626
I actually thought
you'd like to go with me.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,378
- You did not.
- I did, too.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,130
- You did not, because you are not stupid.
- Why, thank you.

9
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:21,048
Slimy and weaselly, yes. But stupid, no.

10
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:23,467
He was totally nice to you
and you were a big jerk.

11
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:25,719
If you like Tristan so much,
you go out with him.

12
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:28,263
- What did you do?
- You wanted something festive.

13
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:31,099
- You made me a Santa burger.
- It's no big deal.

14
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:34,810
No one ever made me something
quite this disgusting before.

15
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:36,645
So you're the big, strong protector?

16
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,355
Little princess needs a protector.

17
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,897
- What's your problem, man?
- Nothing.

18
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:42,274
- Don't like your girlfriend.
- Doesn't look that way.

19
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:44,192
- Were you on a date?
- What?

20
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,528
- You have an escort.
- No, it's Luke.

21
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,822
Which is her way of saying
we weren't on a date.

22
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:50,240
I didn't mean it like that.

23
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:56,662
- You don't want to fight me, Tristan!
- Why not?

24
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:58,079
'Cause l'll kill you, idiot!

25
00:00:58,122 --> 00:01:00,248
What exactly is going on
between the two of you?

26
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:01,499
We're friends, that's it.

27
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,376
You're idiots, the both of you.

28
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:04,793
He has a thing for you.

29
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:07,671
No, he doesn't.
It's just a game to him or something.

30
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:09,464
He has a thing for you.

31
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:12,842
He does nothing but insult me
and make me miserable.

32
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,760
He has a thing for you.

33
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:20,682
Absolutely nothing.

34
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:22,517
- Come on.
- I'm sorry. I'm looking.

35
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:25,561
- But there is nothing in here.
- You're kidding, right?

36
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:27,730
No, everything in here I wear.

37
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:30,481
- What?
- I do. There's nothing to give up.

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,610
The red-and-black halter top.

39
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:35,403
- No.
- Why?

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,362
It's a classic.

41
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:39,405
It's got rhinestones
and zebra stripes on it.

42
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,907
- So?
- Tassels.

43
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:42,492
- Yes.
- It has tassels, Mom.

44
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:44,827
Okay. I've had this since I was 17.

45
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:46,829
I'm sorry. Did I mention the tassels?

46
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,414
You're heartless and unsentimental.

47
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:49,748
You are a hopeless pack rat.

48
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:53,751
I don't understand why I have to uproot
my happy family of clothing, anyway.

49
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:55,544
Because it's a charity rummage sale.

50
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:57,087
- I know.
- That you helped organize.

51
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,797
- Okay.
- And volunteered to run.

52
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:01,591
It was very hot in that room that day.
I was dehydrated.

53
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:03,426
They could have talked me into anything.

54
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,677
- It was your idea.
- Okay.

55
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:08,263
I'm a very sick woman,
and that should be apparent to anyone.

56
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,682
Get out of the way.

57
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:14,477
- What are you doing?
- Step away from the closet, please.

58
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,646
This is so unfair.

59
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,814
No, not that whole chunk.

60
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:22,650
Okay, take that. That's ugly.
Just that one. No.

61
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,902
Now, all of this goes.

62
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:27,696
Come to this dresser, open the drawer,
and take out...

63
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,783
everything you'd be embarrassed
to be wearing in a car accident.

64
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,325
Meet me downstairs.

65
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,161
Move!

66
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:35,629
- Sweater.
- Over here.

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,050
- Jeans.
- In back of you.

68
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:44,762
A big, furry, purple thing
that could either be a hat...

69
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:47,347
a toilet paper cover,
or some kind of dirty hand puppet.

70
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:49,140
Mystery box on the left.

71
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,768
- Hey, Luke.
- Where do you want these?

72
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,438
- What do you have?
- Clothes, rags, some old pots and pans.

73
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,482
Kitchenware can go in the kitchen,
and the clothes right over there.

74
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:04,862
- Here, Grinch.
- Thank you.

75
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:06,822
- Who wants cheese?
- Are there crackers?

76
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:08,907
Somewhere in the state
of Connecticut, yes.

77
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:10,116
And in the Gilmore house?

78
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,410
- Who wants cheese?
- Me, please.

79
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:15,246
Kittens in the toilet poster?

80
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,664
- Another one?
- This one's signed.

81
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,751
There's a man in my kitchen!
Somebody call the constable.

82
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:24,879
- Your mom's a fruitcake.
- Fruitcakes by the door, please.

83
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:27,840
Goodbye, Rory.
I wish you luck with everything.

84
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:29,340
I appreciate that.

85
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:32,385
Okay, so rummage sale's Sunday.
Today's Tuesday.

86
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:35,471
At this rate we're going to be sleeping
in the yard by Thursday.

87
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,890
We've got to get this stuff
out of the living room.

88
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:39,475
- Hello.
- Go away.

89
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:40,892
I have a full set of dishes.

90
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:43,978
- Come on in, Taylor.
- Dishes in the kitchen, please.

91
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:46,355
Okay, but I have
to explain something first.

92
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,691
- Fine, go ahead.
- The butter dish has a small chip in it.

93
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,526
- Safety tip. Got it.
- It's fine.

94
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,863
I filed down the chip. If you place it
strategically on the table, nobody'll know.

95
00:04:55,905 --> 00:05:00,450
Taylor, would you like to write
an instruction manual for the dishes?

96
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,994
- Could I?
- Notepad's in the kitchen.

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,708
That's nice.

98
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:13,169
- Put that back.
- But it has rhinestones on it.

99
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:16,589
The point of this is to get crap out,
not trade it in for new crap.

100
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:19,091
- Are you seeing this?
- Yes, I am.

101
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:21,176
I don't think you are,
because if you were...

102
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,554
you would see that this obviously
has 'Lorelai' written all over it.

103
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:27,890
- Fine. We'll get rid of it at next year's sale.
- Thank you.

104
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:32,060
- You guys are gonna love me.
- We already love you.

105
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:34,938
- No, I mean you're gonna really love me.
- We do.

106
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:37,148
Trust me, you guys are gonna so love me.

107
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:39,108
The love is starting to fade now.

108
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:42,611
I have here in my hand,
as requested by Ms. Lorelai Gilmore...

109
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:47,282
four fabulous tickets to The Bangles
at the Pastorella theater on Saturday.

110
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,075
- What?
- No!

111
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:50,951
- You love me?
- Baby, do I.

112
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:53,286
- These look like good seats.
- Ninth row, aisle.

113
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,289
I can't believe you got me my tickets.
How did you score these?

114
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,374
- Remember the Birnbaum wedding?
- Fiji Fantasy?

115
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,751
Yes. They were so thrilled
with the volcano cake...

116
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,586
they wanted to do something nice for me.

117
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,256
Since Mr. Birnbaum runs a ticket agency,
and I knew you were dying to go...

118
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,175
- so I asked him if he could...
- Make four girls very happy.

119
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,136
- Yeah, and he did.
- Huzzah for the Birnbaums!

120
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:15,639
Sookie, if you got four tickets,
and you and mom go...

121
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,224
then that means...

122
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:19,266
One for you and one for Lane.

123
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:21,019
Chickadee!

124
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:24,980
This is gonna be a very special night.
You know what a special night deserves?

125
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:26,148
What?

126
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,733
- A new outfit.
- Mom.

127
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:29,942
- Yes.
- No.

128
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:31,443
What could the problem be?

129
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:37,073
As I mentioned yesterday,
we will be holding a debate next week.

130
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,535
Your subject:
Did Charles I receive a fair trial?

131
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,079
The pros will represent the Parliament...

132
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:45,623
who deemed they had sovereignty.

133
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,624
The cons will represent the monarch...

134
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,002
and try and prove
that the charge against him was not legal.

135
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,755
What is fascinating, Mr. Dugray?

136
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:57,799
Nothing, Ms. Caldecott.

137
00:06:57,841 --> 00:06:59,383
Nothing, Mr. Dugray?

138
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,429
My notes are fascinating, Ms. Caldecott.

139
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:05,973
Yes, they are fascinating, Mr. Dugray.

140
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:07,474
As I was saying...

141
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,852
the pro and con teams will each
have two minutes and thirty seconds...

142
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:13,813
for introductions, six minutes to debate...

143
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,689
three minutes for conclusions...

144
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:18,316
and five minutes for questions
from the audience.

145
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,194
The winner shall be decided
by a hand count from the rest of the class.

146
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,864
Does that sound like fun, Mr. Dugray?

147
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:28,950
- What?
- The debate. Does it sound like fun?

148
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:32,870
- Yes, it does.
- It does, doesn't it, Mr. Dugray?

149
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,122
It absolutely does, Ms. Caldecott.

150
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:38,042
More fun than staring
at Ms. Gilmore's ear?

151
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,546
- Yes, Ms. Caldecott.
- I think so, too.

152
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,423
Okay. Any questions?
Good. I'll assign your teams.

153
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,051
You, you, you, and you, con.

154
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,471
You, you, you, and you, pro.

155
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:57,308
- Who did she point to?
- Well, I think she...

156
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:58,768
You, you, you...

157
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,061
- Excuse me, Ms. Caldecott.
- Ms. Geller?

158
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,647
I wasn't sure who you pointed to just now.

159
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:07,608
Let's see. You, Ms. Lynn,
Ms. Grant, and Ms. Gilmore.

160
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:11,445
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am, but thank you for asking.

161
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:14,030
Okay, you...

162
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,158
you, you, and you, pro.

163
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:19,368
You and you, con.

164
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:24,122
- So I guess we should make a plan.
- To do what?

165
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:26,291
To work out our debate, Madeline.

166
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,501
- Yeah, right.
- We need a place to work.

167
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,044
- My house is out.
- Why?

168
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:32,254
- Because it is.
- We need a reason.

169
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:34,506
My mother is having
the entire place redone.

170
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,716
She wants all evidence of my father
out of there.

171
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,718
So unless you want to sit on no furniture...

172
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:41,846
and watch Harvey Fierstein
impersonators rip up the carpet...

173
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:44,472
paint everything white
and call it 'Angel's Kiss'...

174
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:47,058
then we're going to have to find
somebody else's house.

175
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:50,644
- My brother has the measles.
- My mom's having an affair.

176
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:55,232
I guess we could go to my house.

177
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:58,568
We're having a town rummage sale,
so it's kind of a mess...

178
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,735
but it's there.

179
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:01,320
Isn't your house kind of far?

180
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:04,990
- It's 30 minutes away by bus.
- Bus? I don't do bus.

181
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:08,576
- Lf you have a better suggestion...
- l'll drive.

182
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:11,078
- Okay. So then, tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

183
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,371
Fine.

184
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:15,665
- Hey, Paris.
- Tristan, hi.

185
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:17,917
I was really hoping
we'd be in the same group.

186
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,543
- You were?
- Yeah.

187
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:23,088
We'd make the long hours of studying
go by a lot faster.

188
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:27,091
Plus, you and me on the same team.
We'd wipe the floor with the others.

189
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:30,094
I guess we'll just have to pair up
on something else then, huh?

190
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,596
- That would be good.
- Yeah, it would.

191
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,016
I'll see you later.
Bye, Madeline. Bye, Louise.

192
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,936
Tristan suddenly has very big eyes
for you, Grandma.

193
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:42,312
- Lucky.
- Stop it. He's just being nice.

194
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:44,523
- He should be so nice to me.
- And me.

195
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:46,566
We need to get to class.

196
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,781
- Tomorrow.
- Wow.

197
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:55,783
- Yep.
- All three of them?

198
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:58,160
'Double, double, toil and trouble.'

199
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,287
It should make
for an interesting afternoon.

200
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,455
'With the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way comes.'

201
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,791
- You're doing well in Shakespeare class?
- Not bad.

202
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,376
- Good.
- Thanks.

203
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,669
So what's the plan?

204
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:11,963
We'll ask if I can go to a play
tomorrow night with you and Lorelai.

205
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:14,090
- A play?
- I think that's the safest word.

206
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:15,883
'Show' or 'concert' would be very bad.

207
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:19,344
- What about saying it's a movie?
- Too far from the truth, almost a lie.

208
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,804
But a play's not a lie?

209
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:23,223
It's far enough from the truth
that it might work...

210
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:24,765
but close enough to the truth...

211
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:27,976
that I think I could negotiate
a purgatory stint, if forced to.

212
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,478
- Play it is.
- Okay. We're going in.

213
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:35,024
- Are you sure it's an original Queen Anne?
- Yes, original.

214
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:36,901
- The joints look wrong.
- Joints are fine.

215
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,611
- They look new.
- Nothing's new. Whole store is old.

216
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,697
Do you have a certificate or a letter
saying that it's old?

217
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,116
- Yes, l'll write a letter.
- Okay.

218
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:48,119
I guess if it's really old, l'll take it.

219
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:50,454
We appreciate your business.

220
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:53,289
She just made a sale. Now's a good time.

221
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:54,707
Hi, Mama.

222
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,958
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

223
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:57,209
- You look flushed.
- I do?

224
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:59,461
You ate candy, doughnut,
or Hostess fruit pie?

225
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:00,670
No, nothing. I'm fine.

226
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:02,088
- Hello, Mrs. Kim.
- Rory.

227
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:04,298
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- I'm busy.

228
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:07,594
I know. Could I could go somewhere
tomorrow with Rory and her mom?

229
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,636
- Tomorrow's church.
- This would be after that.

230
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,013
After church we think about
what we heard in church.

231
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:15,141
I could think about what I heard in church
on the way to the show.

232
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:16,476
- Show?
- Play.

233
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:18,769
Not show, play. It's a play, Mama.

234
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:21,563
Tell me about this play. What's it about?

235
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:25,316
It's about a group of people
who own instruments...

236
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:28,319
and stand in front of other people,
holding them.

237
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:31,155
- What?
- I'm not sure what it's about.

238
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:34,157
- We could find out.
- You find out, then we talk.

239
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:37,326
Excuse me. I'd really like that letter,
if you don't mind.

240
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:38,953
Yes, l'm coming.

241
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:44,166
How's that purgatory negotiation looking?

242
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,459
Not good.

243
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:48,336
- What do we do now?
- I'll ask again later.

244
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:51,672
- Call me if you need anything.
- Thanks. I will.

245
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:23,407
If you want coffee, you'll have to wait.

246
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,993
Someone put a sign for the rummage sale
on your window.

247
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:27,952
You can have decaf now
if you're in a hurry.

248
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:29,578
You should call the cops about this.

249
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:32,457
We know how you feel
about public displays of town affection.

250
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,541
Your mom asked me to put it there, okay?

251
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,085
- And you said yes?
- She's not real good with no.

252
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:38,419
No, she's not.

253
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:42,256
Every second you laugh at me
is one second longer you wait for coffee.

254
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,091
Sorry. No laughing.

255
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:54,016
Margaret Atworthy dropped off
three boxes of City Council potholders...

256
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,728
and begged me to take her grandson.
People are getting crazy, man.

257
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,689
- What?
- What are you wearing?

258
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:03,607
We've already argued
about the sweatshirt.

259
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:05,859
Yes, but we have not argued
about the hat.

260
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:07,944
- What hat?
- The one on your head, Annie Oakley.

261
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:09,070
Great, isn't it?

262
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:11,948
It's nice you're trying
to single-handedly rebuild a bridge...

263
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:14,075
but stop buying other people's junk.

264
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,744
Money goes to charity.
I look cute. Case closed.

265
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,370
Finally, the coffee cavalry arrives.

266
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:20,539
- What do you think you're wearing?
- A hat.

267
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,081
- Take that off.
- What?

268
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:24,792
- That is not yours. Take it off.
- But l'll have hat hair.

269
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:26,961
- I'm talking about the sweatshirt.
- Calm down.

270
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:28,378
That is not yours.

271
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:30,880
No, I found it in the bags of stuff
for the sale.

272
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:33,424
So you just find something
and take it? Is that it?

273
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,634
- No, I paid for it.
- So that makes it all right?

274
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:37,844
It makes it legal.
What is the matter with you?

275
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:39,763
- Nothing's the matter.
- Luke.

276
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,639
Pour your own coffee.

277
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:59,780
Okay. Just a question.
Did anyone in town keep anything?

278
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:02,449
- Doesn't look like it.
- I'll never be civic-minded again.

279
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,284
You're doing a good thing.

280
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:06,285
- Sookie?
- I'm okay.

281
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:09,121
- Wave an arm.
- Here.

282
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,914
I got you.

283
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,751
Hold on. Something down here likes me.

284
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:18,004
I'm good. Hold on. Up, please.

285
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,923
Jeez, this stuff is like Tribbles.

286
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,508
Thank God, just in time.

287
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:24,717
Grab a bag
and move it to this side of the room.

288
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:26,886
Be very careful.
This pile tried to eat Sookie.

289
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,263
Maybe I should sic it on Paris
when she gets here.

290
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:31,473
God, that's right.
You're studying here today.

291
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:34,434
- Any minute, actually.
- This place is such a pit.

292
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:35,769
Don't worry about it.

293
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:38,229
They'll come in, make a face,
say something snotty...

294
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:39,564
we'll study, they'll leave.

295
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,857
I'm looking forward
to this whole day being over.

296
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,317
- Then I can concentrate on the concert.
- Yeah.

297
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,695
Lorelai, sweetheart,
would you come outside, please?

298
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:49,280
I want to know
where you want me to put these.

299
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:50,823
Coming, Patty.

300
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,701
Two very large porcelain squirrels.

301
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:56,244
- Set them free.
- Will do.

302
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:04,793
Wow! These are great.

303
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:08,045
They'll really come in handy
when we organize...

304
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:10,548
that giant marching band
we've been talking about.

305
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,926
I danced on these drums
at the Copacabana...

306
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,803
in 1969.

307
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:18,137
- Wow.
- It was a great act.

308
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:21,932
- I wore bananas.
- Please tell me you have a picture of that.

309
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:26,186
A lot of memories happened
on these drums.

310
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:29,564
But I guess it's time to move on.

311
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:31,024
Yeah, sure.

312
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,400
Now you'll have room
for that enormous tuba...

313
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:35,193
you've had your eyes on.

314
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,030
Leave these here.

315
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,159
Yeah, you, too. Bye.

316
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,248
- That was Lane.
- What's the verdict?

317
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:52,250
She decided to be stupid
and tell her mother the truth...

318
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:55,544
that she wanted to go to a rock concert
with us tonight in New York.

319
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:56,795
Stupid.

320
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:59,465
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm making coffee.

321
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:02,091
This looks really familiar.

322
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:04,385
That's mine. I saw it first...

323
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:06,470
and then I bought it, so it's mine now.

324
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:08,180
Really? Who brought it in?

325
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:11,308
I think Luke did,
and judging by his very hostile reaction...

326
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,975
he wasn't done wearing it yet.

327
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,894
- Oh, my. I wonder if...
- What?

328
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:18,105
I bet this was Rachel's.

329
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:20,524
Oh, my God, Rachel's?

330
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:22,567
Rachel? Who's Rachel?

331
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,069
Rachel was Luke's very serious girlfriend.

332
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:28,363
- It does look like her.
- When did Luke have a girlfriend?

333
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,658
This must have been,
what, five, six years ago?

334
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,619
Did she break that man's heart.
It was terrible.

335
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,120
How did I not know about this?

336
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,790
Honey, you had an 11-year-old kid,
and you were just moving into this house.

337
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,251
Plus Rachel traveled a lot.
She was a photographer.

338
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,918
- Archaeologist.
- Really?

339
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,085
Or flight attendant.

340
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,255
I can't believe I never even heard about it.

341
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:48,589
At least, I think so.

342
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:51,633
Luke never talks about it.
No one else likes to talk about it...

343
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:54,928
'cause he could kill you with that coffeepot
if he wanted to.

344
00:16:56,262 --> 00:17:00,223
I never pictured Luke having a girlfriend
or a broken heart.

345
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:02,976
I would keep this hidden if I were you.

346
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,979
I've got to be going.
Trampoline class at 2:00.

347
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:07,605
- Bye, Patty.
- Bye-bye.

348
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:09,774
Thanks for the drums.

349
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:12,692
These all need to be mended.

350
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:14,444
- My room.
- Okay.

351
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,702
Rory, I think your friends are here.

352
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:30,374
She must be one great baby-sitter,
to earn enough money for that car.

353
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,501
Let's just get this over with.

354
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,420
Take heart, my dear.
Suffer today, party tonight.

355
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:39,381
- Hi.
- Hi.

356
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:41,884
Come on in.

357
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:49,932
- So did you guys find it okay?
- There's no sign on this street.

358
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:53,018
That's why I told you to turn right
at the big rooster statue.

359
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,979
- I thought you were kidding.
- No, we never kid about Monty.

360
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:58,147
- Monty?
- Monty, the rooster.

361
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,400
Monty the Magnificent.

362
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:02,693
- Everybody, this is my mom.
- Lorelai.

363
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,070
This is Louise, Madeline, and Paris.

364
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,906
Very good girl-group names.

365
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:13,452
Sorry about the house of horrors here.

366
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:16,163
Some crazy lady volunteered
to lead this charity thing.

367
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:19,332
We're trying to get her some help.
So make yourselves comfortable.

368
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,251
- Just yell when you guys want pizza.
- Okay.

369
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:27,046
So, do you guys want to work in here
or in the kitchen?

370
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:28,382
Whatever.

371
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:30,717
Okay.

372
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:37,806
Okay. So here's how it should go:

373
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,767
Madeline will do the introductions,
l'll handle the debate...

374
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:44,020
Rory will do the conclusion,
and Louise will take questions.

375
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:46,313
Why do you automatically
get to handle the debate?

376
00:18:46,397 --> 00:18:48,065
Because l'm the most experienced at it.

377
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:50,942
Trust me, you want her to handle it.
She never gives up.

378
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,277
Le pit bull.

379
00:18:53,653 --> 00:18:57,030
- So what is all this stuff?
- It's for a big town rummage sale.

380
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:58,782
- Like a charity thing?
- Yeah.

381
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:02,243
There's an old bridge falling apart,
and the town's trying to save it.

382
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:05,079
- Cool hat.
- Put that down. It's used.

383
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:07,581
- Vintage, dear.
- Filthy, darling.

384
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:11,584
There's a store near my therapist's office
who has the best vintage clothes.

385
00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:14,295
I found an original Pucci top
for practically nothing.

386
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:16,005
Pucci is very big right now.

387
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,382
- Is this a Pucci?
- No, that's a Patty.

388
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,092
- A Patty?
- Miss Patty.

389
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:23,594
She's a dance teacher here.
These are some of her old costumes.

390
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,222
Here, Paris. Tristan might like this.

391
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:28,473
Can we just work, please?

392
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,768
I would love to have a boyfriend
that looked like Tristan.

393
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,769
Your boyfriend's no slouch either.

394
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:36,814
- No, he's not.
- Yes, 6'2' and feisty.

395
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,691
So how's it going?
Are you two still Joanie Loves Chachi?

396
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:42,235
- God, I hope not.
- You are still together, aren't you?

397
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,404
- We're still together.
- How long has it been?

398
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,531
- I don't know.
- You do, too.

399
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:49,241
- About a month.
- Lifers.

400
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:52,536
- Jeez.
- We have a debate to organize here...

401
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:56,121
and this conversation is veering towards
the subject of French kissing...

402
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:58,124
and glitter eye shadow: Trashy or trendy?

403
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,627
I have no intention of being humiliated
in front of the whole class...

404
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,129
because we had to study
in the middle of a carnival...

405
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:06,338
and you two couldn't
keep your eye on the prize.

406
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:08,966
I want to win and I am going to win.

407
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,806
So, how good of a kisser
is Paul Bunyan anyway?

408
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:27,857
Okay. Does anybody in town
have a peg leg?

409
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:31,318
- No.
- Hem these.

410
00:20:32,236 --> 00:20:36,781
- So, tell me more about this Rachel.
- Why are you so curious?

411
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:39,909
Because everybody in town
knows everything about it...

412
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:42,703
- and I don't like to be out of the loop.
- It's old news.

413
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:44,663
Yes, but l'm fascinated. I mean...

414
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:47,082
I go to Luke's once a day.
Sometimes twice.

415
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:51,126
Three times if Michel's talked to a relative
and his accent's gotten thicker.

416
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,754
I feel I should know the whole story.
What happened? Where'd she go?

417
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:59,383
Rachel liked to move around a lot.
She was a very adventurous person.

418
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,427
She loved to climb things,
and fling herself off cliffs...

419
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:05,097
and dive into these really tiny lakes...

420
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,517
and ride big wild horses, and fly planes.

421
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,352
- So she was Wonder Woman.
- She was to Luke.

422
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,354
- I thought they were gonna get married.
- What happened?

423
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:17,273
The rumor is that Stars Hollow
was too small for her.

424
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:19,316
She wanted to live
somewhere more exciting.

425
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:20,485
But Luke didn't.

426
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,737
You know Luke. Lived here all his life.

427
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:26,031
He wouldn't even go away to college.

428
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:29,034
I think we're gonna have to bury him
in that diner.

429
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:31,535
- It's sad.
- Yeah.

430
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,831
Okay. I am done here.
I'm gonna stop by the Inn for a while.

431
00:21:35,873 --> 00:21:38,875
Then l'm gonna go home
and change for the show tonight.

432
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,878
- We leave at 6:00.
- I will be here. Bye.

433
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,729
We'll need the actual quotes,
so learn them by heart.

434
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:04,063
What about using notecards?

435
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:06,565
Notecards look sloppy.
We will know our information.

436
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:09,359
- But the other teams will use notecards.
- And they'll lose.

437
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:12,570
- Bye, girls. Rory, see you tonight!
- Bye, Sookie.

438
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:13,863
What's tonight?

439
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:16,824
We have tickets to see The Bangles
at the Pastorella theater.

440
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:18,242
- In New York?
- Yeah.

441
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:19,952
Sounds potentially not boring.

442
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:22,161
It's gonna be great. The seats are amazing.

443
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:24,163
- Who are you going with?
- My mom and Sookie.

444
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:25,706
- You're kidding.
- What?

445
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,417
- You're going to a concert with your mom?
- Yeah.

446
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:31,503
I cannot imagine doing anything like that
with my mom.

447
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:33,421
We do stuff like this all the time.

448
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:34,964
- Really?
- Yeah.

449
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,134
- How old is your mom, anyway?
- Thirty-two.

450
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,259
Young.

451
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:41,219
That means she had you when she was...

452
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:43,722
She had her when she was 16.
We've done the math.

453
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:46,599
Can we 'ooh' and 'ah' about this quickly
and get to work?

454
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:50,019
- Sixteen. I'm sixteen.
- So am I.

455
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,021
We're all 16, okay.
Everybody in this room is 16.

456
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,106
- Paris is right. We should work.
- Thank you.

457
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,901
- I can't imagine having a baby at 16.
- Then keep your knees shut.

458
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:00,319
Very nice.

459
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:03,113
Do you think your mom is sorry
she got pregnant so young?

460
00:23:03,197 --> 00:23:05,615
- Of course she is.
- Why, thank you.

461
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:09,285
- I didn't mean that. I just meant...
- I don't think she'd recommend it...

462
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:11,787
but I think she's happy
with how things turned out.

463
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,705
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

464
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:17,166
Okay. Just checking.
I'm starving. Is it pizza time yet?

465
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,751
- Are you guys hungry?
- I am.

466
00:23:18,835 --> 00:23:20,419
- I can't eat dairy.
- Okay.

467
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:22,504
One with cheese, one without. Cokes?

468
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:24,464
- Yes, please.
- Me, too.

469
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:26,674
We're never going to finish.

470
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:29,260
I find your mother completely fascinating.

471
00:23:29,552 --> 00:23:30,719
Funny. So does she.

472
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:34,139
- It's almost like having a big sister.
- And you like her, don't you?

473
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:37,642
- She's my best friend.
- Truly, completely fascinating.

474
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,769
- Rory, come in here a sec.
- I'll be right back.

475
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:47,483
How's it going in there?

476
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,320
- Truly, completely fascinating.
- Really?

477
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:52,488
We've basically gotten
no work done at all.

478
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:54,823
Paris is having a meltdown,
which is always fun.

479
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:55,949
Sounds it.

480
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:58,993
And, I don't know, we've just been talking.

481
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:01,495
I think you're actually making
some friends here.

482
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:02,997
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

483
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,416
They've just moved off the plan
to dump the pig's blood on me at prom.

484
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,919
Talking, chatting, no work being done.
There's friend potential going on.

485
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:12,338
Maybe. With Louise and Madeline,
at least.

486
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,757
Two out of three
formerly psychotic enemies. Not bad.

487
00:24:15,841 --> 00:24:19,760
There. Pop-Tart appetizers to tide you over
until the pizza comes.

488
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:21,012
Thanks.

489
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:24,848
Hey, I have kind of a crazy idea.

490
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:27,100
That's never comforting, coming from you.

491
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:28,893
- Consider this, okay?
- Okay.

492
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:31,854
- We have four tickets to the show tonight.
- Yes, we do.

493
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:34,690
- What if I give them to you?
- What are you talking about?

494
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:38,526
Seems like you guys have a bonding thing
going on in there. It might be fun.

495
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:40,946
- What about you?
- You and I have bonded already.

496
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:43,948
If we bond any further,
we'll be permanently fused together.

497
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,617
You've talked about the concert
since you heard about it.

498
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,452
- I can still go.
- How?

499
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,661
Sookie and I can buy cheap seats there.

500
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:53,039
These tickets are ninth row, aisle.
Dream seats.

501
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:54,540
You don't have to do this.

502
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:56,875
But you have three years
of Chilton ahead...

503
00:24:56,918 --> 00:24:59,878
and it'll be nice to have friendly people
to talk to there.

504
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,547
You seem to be getting along.
It might be good.

505
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:06,550
I totally don't mind. I just wanna see
the show. I don't care from what seat.

506
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:08,927
- Are you sure?
- Completely sure.

507
00:25:09,345 --> 00:25:11,304
- Because l...
- Ladies!

508
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:16,851
- What are you guys doing tonight?
- Why?

509
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,270
We have these really great tickets
to see The Bangles...

510
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,397
and Rory thought you might like to come.

511
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:23,982
- Are you serious?
- No way.

512
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,858
Yeah, I mean, if you guys want to.

513
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,943
- I would love to go.
- Count me in.

514
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,612
- Paris, what about you?
- I can't.

515
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,073
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

516
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,241
- Because you're busy doing what?
- I have homework.

517
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,451
She'll be there.

518
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,994
- Good.
- Great.

519
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:01,722
- He made it.
- Oh, he's handy. How great.

520
00:26:01,764 --> 00:26:03,265
You wear it all the time?

521
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:05,684
- Just when she's breathing.
- It's a love thing.

522
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,644
- Thanks for the contribution.
- Okay, here.

523
00:26:09,604 --> 00:26:12,272
With these tickets,
you're about to enter sacred space.

524
00:26:12,356 --> 00:26:16,442
You will be treading on hallowed ground.
You will be walking like an Egyptian.

525
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:17,860
- Mom.
- Take them.

526
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,696
You're gonna have a great time.
The Bangles are the best!

527
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,324
They were my favorite group in
high school. I almost named you Susanna.

528
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:27,118
The day I found out
you had no musical talent at all...

529
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,245
- was the saddest day of my life.
- Sorry.

530
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:32,247
You say that now. Here. Okay.

531
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,625
These are probably located...

532
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,292
Hi.

533
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:38,335
Can you tell me where these seats are?

534
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,255
- Those are right in here.
- Oh, good. Girls.

535
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,883
Here's the deal.
Take your tickets, go to your seats.

536
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,302
Have the night of a lifetime. Bangle it up.

537
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:51,347
The second the concert is over,
meet us in front of the theater. Got it?

538
00:26:51,431 --> 00:26:53,140
- Yes.
- Good. Now go!

539
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,228
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

540
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:03,565
- Okay. Let's go make our noses bleed.
- After you.

541
00:27:07,152 --> 00:27:09,403
- Which aisle is it?
- We're almost there.

542
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:11,823
I have never sat this close
to a stage before.

543
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:14,033
I've never really been to a concert before.

544
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:17,285
So I could be sitting in the back
and say the same thing.

545
00:27:17,328 --> 00:27:19,079
- In here.
- Good.

546
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:27,294
Wow. These are amazing seats.

547
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,712
Yes, they are.

548
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:33,632
- What are they looking at?
- One guess.

549
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,135
Check it out, we've got fans.

550
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:40,471
- Was I right?
- You were right.

551
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:45,685
And before it's dark, they'll have every
picnic basket that's in Jellystone Park.

552
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,190
- Did you ever see Everest?
- No.

553
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:53,733
It's a good movie.

554
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:57,111
We must be getting close.
We're running out of rows.

555
00:27:57,486 --> 00:27:59,154
And 1,000.

556
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:02,656
- Okay. We're here.
- Great.

557
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:11,706
Okay. This is fine.

558
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,042
Yep. Not bad at all.

559
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:16,919
What?

560
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,424
What is so funny?

561
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:25,885
These are the worst seats
in the entire world.

562
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:31,015
- They are, aren't they?
- Oh, my God! It's so funny.

563
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:34,475
- Don't you think this is funny?
- You know, I don't.

564
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,062
I'm sorry.

565
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:48,529
They're starting! Do you have a lighter?

566
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:54,909
You mean a flamethrower. Get it?

567
00:28:54,993 --> 00:28:57,411
A flamethrower, 'cause it's so far.

568
00:28:57,495 --> 00:28:59,913
Ladies and gentlemen, The Bangles!

569
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:57,971
- Was Rachel pretty?
- What?

570
00:30:58,222 --> 00:31:01,516
- I'm just curious. Was she pretty?
- She was pretty.

571
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:06,687
- What kind of pretty?
- What do you mean?

572
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:09,856
Was she a Catherine Zeta-Jones
kind of pretty...

573
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,983
or a Michelle Pfeiffery pretty, or...

574
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:14,485
She was an Elle MacPherson
kind of pretty.

575
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:16,028
- Really?
- Yep.

576
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:20,448
- That's an intense kind of pretty.
- You're not kidding.

577
00:31:20,908 --> 00:31:24,452
I never pictured Luke
with an Elle MacPherson kind of pretty.

578
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:28,539
No? Pictured him more
with a Lorelai Gilmore kind of pretty?

579
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,251
The air up here must be very thin,
because you're delirious.

580
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:35,253
- And you're jealous.
- What?

581
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:38,464
- You're jealous of Rachel.
- You're accusing me of being jealous...

582
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:42,134
of a woman who dumped a man
l'm not even interested in five years ago?

583
00:31:42,217 --> 00:31:44,051
- Yes.
- You don't think that's crazy?

584
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:47,305
- I do think that's crazy.
- Right, l'm not jealous.

585
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:48,847
Yeah, you are.

586
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:04,653
Oh, my God! He is so gorgeous.

587
00:32:05,404 --> 00:32:06,363
I guess.

588
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:09,240
There's a massive party going on
right around the corner.

589
00:32:09,324 --> 00:32:10,741
- So?
- So they invited us.

590
00:32:10,783 --> 00:32:12,075
- Who?
- Jess and Sean.

591
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:14,411
We've been talking to them.
They're extremely cool.

592
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:15,912
- Are we going?
- Going where?

593
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:17,413
To the party.

594
00:32:17,455 --> 00:32:19,832
- There's a concert going on.
- The band won't miss us.

595
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,751
- We can't just leave, Louise.
- It's America, Rory.

596
00:32:22,793 --> 00:32:25,670
- We have to meet my mom after the show.
- Oh, come on.

597
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:27,463
What do you mean, 'Oh, come on'?

598
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:29,840
We have to meet my mother
after the concert.

599
00:32:29,924 --> 00:32:32,009
The band may not miss us,
but Lorelai sure will.

600
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,510
These guys are so cute.

601
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:36,888
- Great, but we're not going anywhere.
- What, are you afraid?

602
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,890
Of going out into a strange city
with guys I don't know? Yeah.

603
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,434
- Please?
- No!

604
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:44,436
- Well, we're going.
- No, you're not.

605
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:47,939
- Paris? Join, please?
- No, thanks.

606
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:50,983
Fine. Come on, Madeline.

607
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:53,902
And just what am I supposed
to tell my mother?

608
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:56,572
That you're a very good little girl.

609
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:04,787
The party's in a building on the corner
of Waverly and First. Try to get away.

610
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:08,081
We'll be back
by the time the concert's over.

611
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:15,170
You know, I really like this band.

612
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,555
- Well?
- I couldn't find Mom or Sookie anywhere.

613
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,432
So what do we do now?

614
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:32,268
I guess we just wait here
for them to find us.

615
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:33,686
Okay.

616
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:37,481
I can't believe Louise and Madeline
would just leave like that.

617
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:39,650
- They've done it before.
- Nice.

618
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,109
Yeah, well.

619
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:47,156
- Can I ask you a question?
- Maybe.

620
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,785
- What could you possibly see in Tristan?
- You wouldn't understand.

621
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:54,203
- Is it just that he's cute?
- Partly.

622
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:56,705
'Cause there are a lot of cute guys
in the world.

623
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:58,415
Not like Tristan.

624
00:33:58,582 --> 00:34:01,667
- He's just such a jerk.
- He's not always a jerk.

625
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:03,253
- No?
- No.

626
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:04,753
Okay.

627
00:34:05,672 --> 00:34:07,298
When is he not a jerk?

628
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,675
I've known Tristan a really long time.

629
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,176
We've been in the same class
since kindergarten.

630
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,720
- Really?
- Yes.

631
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,682
And, well,
he has things in his life that are hard.

632
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,018
His parents, not so great.

633
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,895
- We have that in common.
- Okay.

634
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,481
- He kissed me once.
- He did?

635
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,318
- Sixth grade. On a dare.
- How romantic.

636
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,445
You just don't know him like I do.

637
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:37,864
Okay, I believe you.
I just think maybe you could do better.

638
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:41,868
I know he's flirting with me to get to you...

639
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:44,162
but at least he's flirting with me.

640
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:46,122
- Hey.
- There you are.

641
00:34:46,206 --> 00:34:48,457
Think fast. T-shirts for all the girls...

642
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:51,710
because l'm the Good Witch...
Aren't you missing a couple of kids?

643
00:34:51,794 --> 00:34:53,503
- They left.
- Excuse me?

644
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:56,297
- Madeline and Louise met these guys...
- What guys?

645
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:59,466
They were sitting behind us,
and they were having a party.

646
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,343
- Unbelievable!
- What's going on?

647
00:35:01,385 --> 00:35:02,844
- They left.
- What?

648
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:04,888
Let's go. Come on. Move!

649
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:15,396
If I leave the house with four girls,
l'm coming home with four girls.

650
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:19,233
Hi. I'm looking
for a couple of college boys...

651
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:21,360
who might live here or have friends here.

652
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:24,237
I don't talk to anybody. People annoy me.

653
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:30,201
- What?
- She found him with the blonde again.

654
00:35:32,328 --> 00:35:34,830
She's gonna knock on every door
in the entire building?

655
00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:36,248
- Yep.
- Wow.

656
00:35:37,249 --> 00:35:40,710
Hello! Is anyone home?

657
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:44,546
Hello!

658
00:35:46,757 --> 00:35:48,925
Let's go follow your mother.

659
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:52,803
I wonder, if I was missing,
if my mom would come looking for me.

660
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:56,556
- Paris, you know she would.
- Yeah, or at least she'd send somebody.

661
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,938
- Music.
- Let's go.

662
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:13,362
That's one of the guys.

663
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:15,572
- Yeah?
- Hi. Could you move, please?

664
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:17,449
- What?
- Thanks.

665
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:20,660
Did you miss me?

666
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:22,036
- Lorelai.
- Ms. Gilmore.

667
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,455
- Put the cups down. Let's move.
- Is there a problem?

668
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:28,500
Yeah. See those two idiots over there?
They're 16, underage. I bet you're not.

669
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:31,628
I also bet those big fancy party cups
aren't holding lemonade.

670
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:36,173
You really want to end any conversation
with me now. So just step aside, Skippy.

671
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:39,426
Move your asses. Outside, now!

672
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:50,978
I won't even begin to tell you
how completely insane it is...

673
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:54,980
to take off with strangers or drink things
that you don't know what's in them...

674
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:56,941
or act like you have a clue when you don't.

675
00:36:56,983 --> 00:37:01,194
But if you ever pull a stunt like this again,
it will not be around my kid!

676
00:37:01,278 --> 00:37:03,196
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

677
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,282
Good. Now let's go.
I can't wait to meet your parents.

678
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:10,619
We have some catching up to do.
I think we'll just talk all night long.

679
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:17,374
You know what?
I think this is the best night l've ever had.

680
00:37:26,841 --> 00:37:28,467
I cannot believe I missed it.

681
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:31,011
- The concert was amazing.
- Forget about the concert.

682
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:34,097
I wanted to see Lorelai pull those idiots
out of that apartment.

683
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:35,974
It definitely was a Kodak moment.

684
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:39,101
- You didn't wake me up.
- I set the clock.

685
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:42,062
But the clock stops ringing
once I throw it against the wall...

686
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:44,022
giving me ample time to fall back to sleep.

687
00:37:44,106 --> 00:37:47,233
You, however, never stop yapping
no matter how hard I throw you...

688
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:49,402
thus ensuring the whole wake-up process.

689
00:37:49,485 --> 00:37:51,987
- I'm gonna get a soda. Want anything?
- Gum.

690
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:54,155
The night of my fourteenth birthday back...

691
00:37:54,198 --> 00:37:58,034
so I could right the
green hot pant-roller disco outfit wrong.

692
00:37:58,118 --> 00:37:59,994
- Coming right up.
- Bye.

693
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,372
So, talk to anybody today?

694
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:06,749
- You mean Madeline or Louise or Paris?
- Yes.

695
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:07,958
- No.
- Right.

696
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:10,169
But I bet school tomorrow
will be interesting.

697
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:14,089
Oh, yes. Stories of Rory's crazy,
Bangles-obsessed mother...

698
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:17,550
ripping open apartment doors,
scaring the pointy-haired boys.

699
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:19,176
Totally uncool, man.

700
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,179
I had to do it, Rory.
They could have gotten hurt.

701
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:23,430
I know.

702
00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:27,726
I thought inviting those girls out
would make it easier for you at school.

703
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:30,812
I've always thought 'easy'
is completely overrated.

704
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:32,229
That's my twisted girl.

705
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:35,190
Plus Paris decided
to let me split the debate time with her.

706
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:38,026
Wow! Wait, why am I wowing?

707
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:40,820
Because splitting debate time with her
is like doing...

708
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:44,031
that spitting-in-your-palm
and-shaking-hands friendship oath thing.

709
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:46,867
But way less gross. Good, l'm glad then.

710
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,161
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

711
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,167
Find anything good?

712
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,587
Yeah. I got some refrigerator magnets
shaped like sushi for a nickel.

713
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,839
- So basically I scored.
- Good.

714
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:06,299
- About what happened the other day...
- Forget it.

715
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:08,885
- I was a jerk. I didn't mean it.
- I know. Really.

716
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:10,845
Yeah, well, I am sorry.

717
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,557
- I wanted to give this back to you.
- No. You bought it.

718
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,060
- I know, but it's yours, and I didn't know.
- Didn't know?

719
00:39:18,143 --> 00:39:19,852
About the former owner.

720
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:22,396
If I had, I wouldn't have flaunted it
in front of you.

721
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:24,816
It's no big deal.
I was having a bad day, that's it.

722
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:27,276
Now I got magnetic sushi.
AIl's right with the world.

723
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,652
Okay, good. So here.

724
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:33,698
It obviously means something to you.

725
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:36,158
But you have to let things go
eventually, right?

726
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:39,327
But sometimes you need
a little something to remind you.

727
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:42,038
You wouldn't want to forget everything,
would you?

728
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:45,541
No, there was some stuff
I definitely would not want to forget.

729
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,793
So here, so you don't forget.

730
00:39:48,544 --> 00:39:50,795
Thanks. Can I pay you for it?

731
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,465
- In coffee, absolutely.
- All right.

732
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:00,596
- I'm not pining.
- I know.

733
00:40:00,637 --> 00:40:02,263
- Just remembering.
- Got it.

734
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:04,724
- Remembering is not pining.
- Absolutely right.

735
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:08,978
- It's a memento, like restaurant matches.
- I can see the resemblance.

736
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:10,896
Okay. Good.

737
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,606
- Bye, Luke.
- Bye.
