1
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,266
Mmkay, still walking, all�s good.

2
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:17,197
Mmkay.

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,259
- How are you? 
- I should probably keep moving.

4
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:22,982
God, my feet have never been in this much pain before.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,738
- Oh yeah, what about that time? 
- What time?

6
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:27,016
The time when I did the thing and your feet were...

7
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:29,316
- gotta stop. 
- Gotta sit.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,993
- What were you saying? 
- About what?

9
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:37,913
- About my feet. 
- What about your feet?

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,156
I don�t know. You were talking about the thing you did to my feet.

11
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:40,914
What thing?

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,178
The thing that you...

13
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:44,933
you and... huh?

14
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,576
- What? 
- I don�t know.

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,927
Just an observation � you and I do not function

16
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,180
well on a funky sleeping pattern.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,201
I feel jet-lagged.

18
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:52,537
You�ve been up twenty-four hours straight.

19
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,899
Yes, why did I do that?

20
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:55,205
Because I asked you to.

21
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:56,680
- And that worked? 
- At the time.

22
00:00:56,828 --> 00:00:59,147
- I don�t expect it to again. 
- A realist, I like that.

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,539
How far is Luke�s?

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,331
It�s right over there.

25
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:06,024
- It looks far. 
- Very far.

26
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:07,592
Maybe if we concentrate really hard,

27
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:09,490
our combined psychic powers will move it closer.

28
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,800
I don�t think it�s working.

29
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,695
It�s my fault, I�m not focusing.

30
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:20,454
Yes, that must be why we can�t move a half a city block closer to us.

31
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,433
All right then, let�s go.

32
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:23,893
On the count of three.

33
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:26,803
Oh my God.

34
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:28,262
Thank you.

35
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:30,945
I never realized Luke�s was a hundred miles away.

36
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:32,460
We�re lucky it wasn�t snowing.

37
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:35,148
It would�ve been The Donner Party all over again, but with slightly better hair.

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,050
Why are you sitting over there?

39
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:39,771
Where?

40
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:40,915
At that table.

41
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:42,855
How did I get here?

42
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:44,145
You sat there.

43
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,963
Well, this chair�s very close to that chair,

44
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,775
so you understand how I could�ve made the mistake.

45
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,014
Move over here with me.

46
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:50,371
Why don�t you move over here with me?

47
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:52,198
Because I�m not the one who sat in the wrong chair.

48
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:56,101
I think it�s a little presumptuous to assume that my chair is the wrong chair

49
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:58,015
when my chair could just as easily be the right chair.

50
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:59,392
- No. 
- Why?

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,120
Because I�m the leader of the clan, the provider of the household,

52
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:05,584
the alpha male, and the one whose feet just fell asleep

53
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,119
so there�s absolutely no chance of movement.

54
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:08,604
Fine.

55
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:10,791
Thank you.

56
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,367
See, it�s nice sitting at the grown-up table, isn�t it?

57
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:16,945
Oh, excuse me, did my trophy bump you?

58
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,225
No, Kirk, it didn�t.

59
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,171
Good, because the size of it is so large

60
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,497
that sometimes I can�t judge where the exact end of it is.

61
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:23,664
We�re fine, Kirk.

62
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:27,518
I�m glad, because these shiny golden edges are actually very sharp.

63
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,899
They could take an eye out or cause a deep gash completely unintentionally.

64
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:33,300
It�s almost more a weapon than a trophy.

65
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,435
Really? Can I hold it, then?

66
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,465
Get out of the way, Kirk. You�re blocking the door.

67
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,825
Luke, I�ll be needing one of your larger tables this morning,

68
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,621
since your smaller tables simply cannot accommodate the sheer size

69
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,021
- of my massive trophy. 
- Put it on the floor.

70
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:45,262
It needs its own chair.

71
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,551
It�s gonna need some glue if you don�t sit down pretty soon.

72
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:48,998
Everybody hates a winner.

73
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:52,184
How �bout one person gets pancakes

74
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:53,848
and one person gets eggs and then we can share?

75
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:54,963
I can�t, I have to go.

76
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:56,465
What are you talking about? It�s...

77
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:58,768
It took us thirty minutes to get here?

78
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:00,760
- Lots of limping. 
- Wow, shoot.

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,412
At least grab a donut before you go.

80
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,854
Hey, Luke, we need a couple of donuts,

81
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:10,253
and... some of those extra legs Heather Mills is sending over to Croatia.

82
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:11,221
Coming right up.

83
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:21,421
- I have to get to school. 
- Yeah, me too.

84
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:31,948
What the hell was that?

85
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,436
That was episode one of Rory and Jess: The Early Years.

86
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:35,194
What?

87
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:36,634
Rory and Jess are together.

88
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:38,230
Are you serious? What about Dean?

89
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:39,951
Dean and Rory broke up at the dance.

90
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:42,315
They did? I was at the dance, how come I didn�t know about this?

91
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,623
Because you�re you.

92
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:44,611
But why, what happened?

93
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:47,135
- Jess happened. 
- Wow, wow.

94
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:49,321
- So... 
- Yup.

95
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:50,504
Wow. Well, this is great.

96
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:51,724
I�ll tell Dean you said that.

97
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:54,130
You know what I mean, Rory and Jess, Jess and Rory.

98
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:57,202
I think this is great. Don�t you think this is great?

99
00:04:57,386 --> 00:05:00,186
I think Rory�s seventeen and it�s probably about time for a Jess.

100
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:03,023
Look, I know Jess is a little tough sometimes,

101
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:05,097
but he likes Rory and Rory�s a good kid,

102
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,705
hopefully she�ll rub off on him.

103
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:08,927
You know what, I�ve spent a lot of time and energy

104
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:11,896
fighting the whole Jess thing. Rory�s made her choice,

105
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:14,821
I want her to be happy. I�m just hoping for the best at this point.

106
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:15,845
Very romantic.

107
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:18,226
Says the man who yelled "Finally!" at the end of Love Story.

108
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:19,316
I�ll get you coffee.

109
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:20,330
Thank you very much.

110
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:23,105
Do it again, please!

111
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:27,018
I�m not quite sure what other way there is to say �no walnuts in the salad�

112
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,127
except to say �no walnuts in the salad.�

113
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,729
Mom, she just made a mistake.

114
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,490
She doesn�t listen, she doesn�t care, she has no work ethic.

115
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,168
She has some work ethic. You made her remake the salad four times.

116
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:37,786
I like things done correctly.

117
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:40,396
- Preferably the first time. 
- Thank you, Richard.

118
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:44,610
You know, Mom, in Europe, they eat the salad last and the main course first.

119
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,193
- We�re not in Europe. 
- We could pretend.

120
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,875
Really, Lorelai, you can�t wait ten minutes for another salad?

121
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:50,228
The situation�s that dire?

122
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,326
Four salads ago, no, not dire.

123
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:55,098
Right now it�s �your money for nothing and your chicks for free.�

124
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,745
- Rory? 
- She didn�t have lunch.

125
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:58,729
Fine.

126
00:05:59,051 --> 00:05:59,869
Where are you going?

127
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,050
Apparently, we�re going to be European tonight.

128
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,485
Oh, wonderful. I was getting so tired of being American day after day after day.

129
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,113
God, I�m starved.

130
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,900
- Think about something else. 
- Like what?

131
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,640
Something disgusting that will take your appetite away.

132
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:13,848
Ari Fleischer?

133
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,347
Ari Fleischer is our nation�s mouthpiece, young lady.

134
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,066
Officially not hungry now.

135
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,188
Liliana will be right out with the sand dabs.

136
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:22,019
I�m afraid we�re going to have to let her go, Richard.

137
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:24,002
Oh, if that�s how you feel, Emily.

138
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,443
You�re firing someone over putting walnuts in a salad?

139
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:28,687
I�m going to fire someone over putting walnuts in the salad

140
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:31,026
after she was told not to put walnuts in the salad.

141
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:32,891
Mom, you know, if you�re not a little nicer to your help,

142
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:35,333
you might find yourself in a Frank Lloyd Wright situation.

143
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:36,398
Frank Lloyd Wright?

144
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:39,121
What on earth does Frank Lloyd Wright have to do with my salad?

145
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:40,247
And your walnuts.

146
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:42,921
Mrs. Wright apparently had this major problem with her help.

147
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,076
She was very rough on them and they totally hated her.

148
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,538
So this guy who had worked for her forever, he had finally had enough.

149
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:51,431
I believe the incident was over walnuts, wasn�t it, honey?

150
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,135
The exact cause has not been proven.

151
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:55,661
Anyhow, Mrs. Wright invites this whole posse of people

152
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:58,031
over for dinner and they�re all sitting around eating,

153
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:03,131
and Mr. Disgruntled Servant Guy goes outside and locks all the doors and windows

154
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:06,991
and douses the whole house in gasoline and sets the place on fire.

155
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,261
My goodness.

156
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,831
So the house is on fire, and people are freaking out,

157
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,231
so they run to the doors but the doors are locked,

158
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:14,600
so a few of them try to get out through the windows,

159
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:19,727
but Mr. Angry-Puss is standing outside with an ax hacking them to death

160
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:21,088
and so they all died.

161
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:22,967
Why on earth would you tell me that story?

162
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:27,073
All I�m saying is sometimes eating a walnut is preferable

163
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:30,351
to getting hacked to death or set on fire during dinner.

164
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:32,651
One of these days I�m going to make you eat in your room.

165
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,267
I�m going to go get myself another soda. Would anyone else like something?

166
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:38,144
I�d like a big bag of walnuts, and make sure you tell her they�re for me.

167
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,895
I believe I need a little more ice.

168
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:42,701
Emily, are you fine?

169
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,293
Yes, Richard, I�m fine, thank you.

170
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:48,830
Oh, stop that!

171
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:52,911
- Did you find it? 
- Yes, I did.

172
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:53,977
Good, good.

173
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:57,038
Ah, here we are, ice.

174
00:07:58,405 --> 00:07:59,277
And...

175
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:03,069
- chocolates. 
- Bless you.

176
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:07,365
So, tell me, how�s it going at school?

177
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:08,836
It�s good. It�s crazy.

178
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,591
- Senior year. 
- Yup.

179
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,850
Preparing for college can be a daunting task.

180
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,076
I remember when I was preparing for Yale.

181
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,411
- Bad? 
- I don�t believe I slept the entire year.

182
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:20,499
- I didn�t even cut my hair for two months. 
- Grandpa!

183
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:24,410
Oh, yes, it was quite a scandal. But in the end, it was all worth it.

184
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:28,655
My years at Yale were absolutely the most gratifying ones of my life.

185
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:33,018
Just the sheer freedom of knowing that anything I wanted to learn,

186
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:34,524
I could learn right there.

187
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:37,443
Plus, the history of the place, the heritage...

188
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:38,926
- my father went to Yale. 
- I know.

189
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:42,245
I also made wonderful friends there. Friends I still have today.

190
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:43,350
That must be nice.

191
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:46,649
I�m going to be going back there next week.

192
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,229
There�s going to be a little reunion of the Whiffenpoofs.

193
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,365
I�m sorry, the what?

194
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:53,013
It�s an a cappella singing group I belonged to at Yale.

195
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:56,296
- A singing group? 
- A very famous singing group, actually.

196
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,881
Like the Beatles, but with better table manners.

197
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:00,186
I�ve never heard you sing.

198
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:02,080
Well, I�m no Perry Como,

199
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:04,529
but my shower hasn�t kicked me out yet.

200
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:09,085
Anyway, a group of us are going to get together at the old alma mater

201
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:11,882
and have a little dinner, swap some war stories.

202
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:12,822
Sounds fun.

203
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:14,989
Excuse me.

204
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:17,667
Did you see what I just saw?

205
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:19,039
- Walnuts. 
- Poor Grandma.

206
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:20,662
Poor us.

207
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:27,857
You know, you might wanna come with me next week.

208
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:28,947
Come with you where?

209
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:29,998
To Yale.

210
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:30,699
What?

211
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,773
I don�t mean to the dinner, that would be boring for you,

212
00:09:32,896 --> 00:09:34,800
but you might enjoy seeing the school.

213
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:37,996
Your mother could come to. It would be a fun little adventure.

214
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:40,970
We could drive down, have a little roadside snack,

215
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,447
get there about noon. Have a little tour,

216
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,968
and then the two of you girls could go off and have fun,

217
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,027
and the old folks can have a somber little dinner.

218
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,816
I think you�d love to see it. I certainly would love to show it to you.

219
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,719
Well... sure, Grandpa.

220
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,516
- That would be nice. 
- Wonderful.

221
00:09:57,182 --> 00:10:00,535
Oh, I�m thrilled. Do you wanna tell your mother or shall I?

222
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:03,034
Oh, you know what, I can tell her.

223
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:04,166
All right, you tell her.

224
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:09,184
Looks like we�re gonna need a few more of these.

225
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:17,274
Okay, I officially vote that we send my mother

226
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:20,201
an anonymous note requesting that she never make us the sand dabs again.

227
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:22,180
I�m not sure how anonymous it would be considering

228
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,575
she said we were the first people she ever made them for.

229
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:30,540
I have to tell you something.

230
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:31,570
Okay.

231
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,193
Grandpa talked to me tonight.

232
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,194
Why�d you turn the car off?

233
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:38,549
I�m just getting the sense that I shouldn�t be driving

234
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,602
- a large vehicle when you tell me this. 
- It�s no big deal.

235
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,261
- It�s not. 
- Then tell me.

236
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,793
Okay. Well, Grandpa was mentioning that he and Grandma

237
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,618
are going on a trip next week, a driving trip somewhere,

238
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,483
and he invited me to go. And you.

239
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:54,043
He invited you and me to go on a trip with him and Grandma.

240
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:55,307
- Where? 
- What?

241
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:57,315
- Where�s the driving trip to? 
- Yale.

242
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,715
Mom?

243
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:02,891
Mom, wait.

244
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:04,545
No, it�s okay, I got it.

245
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,505
He�s going for some nostalgia thing.

246
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:09,692
For a reunion of, I don�t know, the Whiffenhoofs.

247
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:10,981
- Poofs. 
- What?

248
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,063
- Whiffenpoofs. 
- Not much better.

249
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,193
I totally agree.

250
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:16,404
Well, he got all sentimental and he really just wants to show me the campus.

251
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:17,900
- It�s no big deal. 
- It�s a huge deal.

252
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:18,447
Mom.

253
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,943
There�s a reason he wants to drag you out there, Rory.

254
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,702
He�s manipulating you. Trust me, I know, he�s a master at it.

255
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:26,931
Okay, fine, maybe he is, but he really wants me to go, I can tell.

256
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,691
And you don�t have to go. I mean, he invited you

257
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:33,854
and I would really love it if you could come, but really, you can stay home.

258
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:36,778
Just please don�t make a big thing out of this. This doesn�t have to be a fight.

259
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,564
- Rory. 
- We go. We look.

260
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:41,028
Hi Yale. Bye Yale. It�s over. No harm, no foul.

261
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:43,266
How many more two-word sentences can you come up with?

262
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:46,132
You know, it doesn�t have to be a total loss.

263
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:48,093
Look, as she�s leading me back to the car.

264
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:51,023
I�m sure you and I can figure out a fun thing to do

265
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,710
while they�re off at dinner, some cool road trip thing.

266
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,493
- In New Haven? 
- Well, yeah.

267
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:56,941
Sweetie, have you ever been to New Haven?

268
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,709
No.

269
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,987
Take a look at the coffee pot tomorrow before I clean it, that�s New Haven.

270
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:02,425
We can make it fun.

271
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:04,664
It would mean a lot to the grandparents, everybody wins.

272
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:05,799
Rory, listen to me.

273
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,581
I know, I am being manipulated.

274
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,618
This is part of Grandpa�s evil plan to take over my life,

275
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,987
abolish my free will, pull me in into the Gilmore world,

276
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:16,194
dress me in pearls, and ruin my life. Did I leave anything out?

277
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:17,822
Let me see...

278
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:20,817
manipulate, evil plan, no free will, pearls...

279
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:24,161
no, I think you about covered it. Oh, wait � did you call my father the Puppet Master?

280
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:25,068
No, I did not.

281
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,501
Always call him the Puppet Master.

282
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:27,934
I will never make that mistake again.

283
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:34,134
Luke, where�s your lost and found?

284
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,468
Out back in the dumpster.

285
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,509
I need your help. I don�t know what to do.

286
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:39,793
- I�m shaking like a spastic colon. 
- What�s the matter, Kirk?

287
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,191
- My trophy�s gone. 
- What?

288
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:42,548
- Someone took her. 
- Kirk.

289
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:45,508
The last time I remember seeing her, she was next to me at the movies.

290
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:46,552
Stop calling it she.

291
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,652
I retraced my steps all day and nothing.

292
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,895
- I suspect foul play. 
- Foul play?

293
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:52,113
Kidnapping, possibly.

294
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:53,516
Then, I think you should go to the police,

295
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:57,039
and if they mention something about staying somewhere for observation, it�s just routine.

296
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:00,137
- Hey Kirk. 
- Rory.

297
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:01,996
What are you doing?

298
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,008
Where were you this morning at about ten?

299
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:04,940
At school.

300
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,409
- Do you have any witnesses? 
- Yes.

301
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,104
- Can you get them to make a short statement? 
- No.

302
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,697
Well, okay.

303
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:13,674
Someone took his statue again.

304
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:15,093
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Every year.

305
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:16,997
Well, there�s some things in life that never let you down.

306
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,092
- So... 
- So...

307
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:20,546
It�s nice to see you, Rory.

308
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:22,061
It�s nice to see you, too, Luke.

309
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:24,252
So, table for one?

310
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:27,063
- I�ll just sit at the counter. 
- Okay. What can I get you?

311
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:28,826
I guess I�ll have a cheeseburger.

312
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:36,603
Hey Jess, look who�s here � Rory.

313
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,499
Okay, time to add another word. Jess, you want something to eat?

314
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,542
- I�m not hungry. 
- Oh, yeah, I�m not hungry either.

315
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,538
- What about the burger? 
- Oh, well...

316
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:48,712
could you wrap it up? I�m gonna eat it later.

317
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:51,790
I actually prefer burgers after they�ve been sitting around for awhile.

318
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:53,398
- Let�s them age. 
- Okay.

319
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,056
You know, I�ve got that book upstairs.

320
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,964
Oh, the book we talked about?

321
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:03,168
- Yup. 
- Great.

322
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:04,704
We could go upstairs and look at it.

323
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,937
Look at the book, sure.

324
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:08,874
Let�s go upstairs and look at the book.

325
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:29,957
- So, here we are. 
- Yup, here we are.

326
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:34,867
Wow, I haven�t seen it since you guys redid it.

327
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:35,866
Oh yeah.

328
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:36,967
It�s bigger.

329
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,915
Ripping a wall down can have that effect on a room

330
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,617
- That part, over there. 
- That�s mine.

331
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:48,590
- You want a soda? 
- No, I�m fine.

332
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:55,200
You sure you don�t want a soda?

333
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:56,415
Yeah, I�m sure.

334
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:00,514
Please let me get you a soda.

335
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:02,932
I gotta do something other than stand here like a moron.

336
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:05,231
Take comfort in the fact that you are not doing it alone.

337
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:08,155
Okay, let�s just regroup here.

338
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:09,691
Yeah, regroup.

339
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:13,004
First of all, we should try to get within, say, a foot of each other.

340
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:19,716
I think that�s about a foot.

341
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,697
That school of yours is really paying off.

342
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,653
So, now what?

343
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:25,748
Now we should...

344
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:30,673
Well, I think we either need to get a little closer or need to warm up.

345
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:46,670
I got the burger.

346
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:48,677
- Thank you. 
- I also threw in some fries.

347
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,966
Fries, great. I love fries.

348
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:52,855
Okay, Jess, thank you for...

349
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,149
your... I gotta go.

350
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,605
- What was going on up here? 
- Nothing.

351
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:04,703
Nothing? I walk in here and the two of you are like shrapnel.

352
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:06,301
Your timing is perfect, by the way.

353
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:07,879
Next time I�ll hang a sock on the door.

354
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:11,052
Hey, there will be no hanging of socks on the door in my house, do you hear me?

355
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,260
Relax, I was kidding.

356
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,037
Oh, really? Hanging socks on doors � that�s your idea of funny.

357
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,167
Depending on the sock design, could be hilarious.

358
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:18,580
- Okay, that�s it, sit down. 
- Why?

359
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:20,658
It�s time to lay down a few ground rules, sit.

360
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:28,626
All right, first off, when she is up here, that door stays open.

361
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:29,597
Excuse me?

362
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:32,475
You are not allowed on either end of this apartment.

363
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:35,404
You are, instead, to remain here in the middle portion of the room.

364
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,386
You may sit on the couch or on the chair,

365
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:39,768
as long as you two are sitting on separate seats,

366
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,025
i.e. when you�re on the couch, then she�s on the chair.

367
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:44,171
When she�s on the couch, then you�re on the chair.

368
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:45,445
I get it, thank you.

369
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:48,672
On weekdays, you will have her home by nine.

370
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,473
On weekends, you will have her home by eleven.

371
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:53,311
Any evidence of alcohol, cigarette smoke, or anything else

372
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:55,681
that Nancy Reagan would find unacceptable

373
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:58,804
and you will not be allowed near her without an adult present.

374
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,385
- Are these rules clear? 
- Yes.

375
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,626
- Good. 
- May I speak?

376
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:02,630
If you must.

377
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:06,336
Do you want me to have you committed or would you prefer to check yourself in?

378
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:07,744
I�m not joking here, mister.

379
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,078
You know you�re my guardian, not hers, right?

380
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,624
You don�t need a guardian.

381
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,109
- She tried to kiss me. 
- Jess.

382
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:16,337
She did that thing where you stretch

383
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,389
and then you put your arm around the other person�s shoulder

384
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:21,472
and then you sneeze and then your hand falls and you try to grab �

385
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,619
Jess, stop it.

386
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:24,878
What do you think is gonna happen?

387
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:26,649
You know what I think is gonna happen.

388
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,016
No, I don�t. Tell me.

389
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:29,752
Tell me what I�m gonna do to her.

390
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,128
You�re not gonna do anything to her because when you�re at her place,

391
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:33,659
there�s Lorelai, and when you�re here, there�s me,

392
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:35,497
and when you�re out there, there�s Taylor.

393
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,679
Romeo and Juliet had warring families

394
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:40,341
and they still managed to do a little damage, you know?

395
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:42,799
As soon as I catch you in a pair of tights, I�ll get worried.

396
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:44,172
Until then, do your homework.

397
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,034
Rory, let�s move! They�ll be here any minute.

398
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:55,385
I�ll be right there.

399
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:56,818
And make sure to bring an extra coat.

400
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:57,699
Why?

401
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:00,413
Do not ask why. It�s Gilmore road rules, trust me.

402
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:01,842
But that doesn�t make any sense.

403
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,106
We�re only gonna be gone for one day.

404
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,471
Yeah, do me a favor, say those exact words to my mother

405
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,079
- when she shows up. 
- Taking the coat.

406
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,684
Now, I have been doing some research on our trip.

407
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:11,484
- Oh yeah? 
- Yeah.

408
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,977
I went to the bookstore and I found this.

409
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,499
- "The Best of New Haven." 
- Yeah.

410
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:16,311
- It�s light. 
- It�s New Haven.

411
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:20,746
Anyhow, I looked through it and it just so happens that one of the best taco places

412
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:22,721
on the East Coast is ten minutes from campus.

413
00:18:22,814 --> 00:18:23,930
- We like tacos. 
- Yes, we do.

414
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:28,539
"You haven�t had a taco until you�ve spent some time at Hector�s, crisp and meaty � "

415
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:29,578
- Dirty. 
- Thank you.

416
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:31,238
 "Not greasy. With homemade tortillas,

417
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:34,545
it elevates this fast finger food to the level of haute cuisine."

418
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:35,595
- Sounds good. 
- Yeah,

419
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:38,631
so I thought maybe when Dad was busy poofing it up, we could go say hello to Hector.

420
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:39,638
I like your thinking.

421
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,284
Good. Where�s your stuff?

422
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:42,953
I put the extra coat by the door.

423
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:44,518
Yeah, I know, but where�s your stuff?

424
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:45,507
What stuff?

425
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:48,083
Rory, I left a list on your dresser last night.

426
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,204
I thought you were kidding.

427
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,889
- You didn�t pack? 
- Well...

428
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:55,236
Rory, let me explain something to you.

429
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:57,672
The way you survive a road trip with my mother

430
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:01,288
is to make sure you have all your bases covered, leave nothing to chance.

431
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:04,848
Never give her the opportunity to give you a thirty-minute lecture on how,

432
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:07,167
if you�d brought the second bathing suit like she told you to,

433
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:10,797
it wouldn�t have mattered that the first one�s strap broke in a freak poolslide incident

434
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:12,763
that no one, including the Amazing Kreskin,

435
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:14,697
could�ve predicted, you would�ve been covered.

436
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:17,335
I have to bring a bathing suit? It�s thirty degrees outside.

437
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,567
This was an example based on a true story.

438
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:20,827
Now, get a skirt to go with this.

439
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:22,957
But I�m still confused. When are we changing?

440
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:23,863
Not the point.

441
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,474
We�re driving, we�re walking, we�re eating tacos, and we�re driving again.

442
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:27,372
Check the list.

443
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,564
Why do I need rain boots?

444
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,115
Why are you still questioning me?

445
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,896
Should I bring both a rain hat and an umbrella, or will one or the other do?

446
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:35,072
Forget it, stupid question.

447
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:37,611
Oh wow.

448
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:41,047
I guess this means there really isn�t a Dean anymore, huh?

449
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:43,275
Yeah, that and it broke in the shower this morning.

450
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,384
Though I probably would�ve taken it off anyway.

451
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,309
Or Jess would�ve done it for you.

452
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:48,656
What did that mean?

453
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:52,102
It just meant Jess wouldn�t want you wearing another guy�s bracelet.

454
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,231
Or that Jess is a thief and he would�ve stolen it.

455
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,814
It does work on both levels, doesn�t it?

456
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,437
So this is how it�s gonna be from now on?

457
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:58,282
What does that mean?

458
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:00,227
- You like Dean and you hate Jess. 
- Rory.

459
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:02,517
Jess will always be the evil guy who mouthed off to you

460
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:04,605
and wrecked my car and Dean will always be the perfect guy

461
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,238
who would come over and change the water bottle.

462
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,938
I forgot about the water bottle.

463
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,668
- Mom. 
- Rory, I said nothing.

464
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:12,538
I didn�t mean what you thought I meant about Jess.

465
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:14,550
- I�m trying to be supportive about this. 
- How supportive?

466
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:16,279
Supportive. You know, go team.

467
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,266
I�m serious, I wanna know how it�s gonna be.

468
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:19,654
Like, can I invite him over?

469
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:20,770
Of course you can invite him over.

470
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:22,040
Well, can he actually come into the house?

471
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:23,263
Yes, he can come into the house.

472
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:24,995
- Are you going to talk to him? 
- Oh my God.

473
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:26,050
Are you going to talk to him?

474
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:27,642
I�ll at least match him grunt for grunt.

475
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:30,709
Okay. Now, let�s say he�s in the house and there�s a fire,

476
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,963
and you can either save him or your shoes � which is it?

477
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:34,657
That depends � did he start the fire?

478
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,352
Mom.

479
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:37,724
Rory, I promised you before and I�m promising you again,

480
00:20:37,884 --> 00:20:39,676
I will cut this kid all kinds of slack.

481
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:41,314
Did I like Dean? Yes.

482
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,613
Did I worry about you less when you were with Dean? Yes.

483
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:45,625
But I never expected you to be with Dean forever,

484
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:47,674
just like I don�t expect you to be with Jess forever.

485
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,244
Oh, so now you�re just waiting for the day I�m not with Jess anymore, is that it?

486
00:20:50,397 --> 00:20:53,336
You know what, I�m actually looking forward to my mother getting here.

487
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:54,463
I�m kidding and thank you.

488
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:55,892
You�re annoying, and you�re welcome.

489
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,451
Let the games begin.

490
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,924
- Your drivers have arrived. 
- Hi Grandma, hi Grandpa.

491
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:04,699
Hello Rory, hello Lorelai. What a perfect day for a drive.

492
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:05,508
Sure is.

493
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,243
- You brought an umbrella? 
- And a rain cap.

494
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:09,071
- Excellent! 
- Here, let me help you with those.

495
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,241
- Where are you going with that? 
- To the car.

496
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:17,257
- You can�t have that in the car. 
- I know.

497
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:19,057
Then, what are you doing with it?

498
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:21,432
- Walking it. 
- Lorelai.

499
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:24,428
Mom, I know I can�t have it in the car. It will not be in the car.

500
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,353
- Is that everything? 
- Yes, I think so.

501
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,871
All right, then. Let�s get this show on the road.

502
00:21:33,674 --> 00:21:34,770
Now let�s see you drink it.

503
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:40,264
Good to the last drop.

504
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,861
You stay that way until it�s gone.

505
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,148
Aye, aye, captain.

506
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:44,550
Let�s go Richard.

507
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:46,517
All right-y.

508
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:57,105
Wow, does that guy look smart.

509
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:59,144
I mean it, he�s got the smart look down.

510
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:01,166
The glasses, the furrowed brow, the ticky walk.

511
00:22:01,282 --> 00:22:02,946
- The Kierkergaard. 
- I really think it�s the walk.

512
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,985
Well, we are at Yale, you know. There are smart people here.

513
00:22:05,134 --> 00:22:07,545
I know there are smart people here. I just didn�t realize how many.

514
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,684
I bet if I pulled my checkbook out now, twelve guys could help me balance it.

515
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:12,512
Thirteen if you were near the right building.

516
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:14,965
Grandpa, that art gallery was amazing. Thank you.

517
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:18,555
Yale has one of the finest collections of British art in the world.

518
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:19,767
Louvre, schmouvre.

519
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:22,056
Oh, I spent a lot of time in that gallery as a young man.

520
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,115
I�ll say you did.

521
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:25,066
What was that �I�ll say you did�?

522
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,349
I just remember that that gallery was one

523
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:29,645
of your father�s favorite places to bring the ladies.

524
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:30,879
- What? 
- Emily.

525
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,019
It�s where you took me on our first date.

526
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:34,842
So, Dad liked to impress �em with the paintings.

527
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:36,214
Why did you bring this up?

528
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:39,245
He was a master of the frown, step back, wrinkle and sigh.

529
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:40,699
- The what? 
- Frown.

530
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:42,676
Step back.

531
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:44,739
Wrinkle.

532
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:47,305
- And sigh. 
- I did no such thing.

533
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:49,966
And then he�d talk about the paintings he had seen in Paris

534
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,107
and the colors of Titian, and by the end of the date,

535
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,233
you thought he was the most brilliant man in the entire world.

536
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,506
Using Titian to score. Even Titian didn�t do that.

537
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:57,878
You shouldn�t tell them this.

538
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,531
They�ll think I was some kind of lothario.

539
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:00,540
Well, you were.

540
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:03,510
I was just a young single man

541
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:05,343
who wanted to experience life.

542
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:08,596
- Don�t ever fall for that line. 
- I promise.

543
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,993
You know, Emily, you weren�t such an innocent little doe

544
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,338
- lost in the woods yourself. 
- I beg your pardon?

545
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:16,905
They�re turning on each other, I love it.

546
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:20,709
I�ll have you know, I was happily involved in a very serious relationship

547
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:23,234
when your mother decided she simply had to have me.

548
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,742
Oh, the size of your ego, I swear.

549
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,463
- Linny Lott. 
- That mouse?

550
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:28,926
Oh, that mouse and I were engaged.

551
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:30,069
Oh, you were not.

552
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:32,609
I�d given her my pin, I�d introduced her to my parents.

553
00:23:32,773 --> 00:23:33,433
So?

554
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:35,328
The date was set, invitations mailed out.

555
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:36,183
Mom.

556
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:37,713
Well, you couldn�t marry Linny Lott.

557
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:39,798
That woman needed directions to get to a point.

558
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:43,566
Richard Gilmore, you are going to give these girls the wrong impression.

559
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,363
What impression is that, Grandma?

560
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:47,817
That you were the Helena Bonham Carter of the society set?

561
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:51,067
I did not steal your grandfather, I simply gave him a choice.

562
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,338
When you showed up at my fraternity party in that blue dress, I had no choice.

563
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:58,144
You stole my father with fashion.

564
00:23:58,322 --> 00:23:59,875
I can�t believe you remember the dress.

565
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:02,021
I can�t believe you were the other woman.

566
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,736
Oh, this is ridiculous.

567
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,173
Another woman should be saying this is ridiculous.

568
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:07,181
Will you stop?

569
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:09,465
- Well... 
- Well what?

570
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:11,933
You mean you don�t remember?

571
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:16,300
Oh my God! There was a bench here.

572
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:17,703
They moved it last year.

573
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:18,856
I can�t believe this.

574
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:20,566
Me either. What if we wanted to sit down?

575
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:22,542
This is where your father proposed?

576
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:23,859
- Really? 
- That�s right.

577
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,666
- By the trash can. 
- That�s right.

578
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:27,356
Well, that�s very romantic...

579
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,199
especially if you need to spit your gum out.

580
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:31,854
We were going to meet my girlfriends who were going to drive me back to school.

581
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:33,189
And you were angry with me.

582
00:24:33,316 --> 00:24:35,312
Because you wouldn�t commit to plans for the holidays.

583
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:37,106
Because I was going to invite you to the house

584
00:24:37,202 --> 00:24:38,758
to meet my parents after I proposed.

585
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:41,666
Which I didn�t know because you gave me no indication whatsoever.

586
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,990
Anyway, you had just finished calling me a spineless jellyfish.

587
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,079
And you got very annoyed, reached in your pocket,

588
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:48,544
pulled out a box and said, "Here."

589
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,485
And you opened the box, showed no emotion,

590
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,019
slammed it close and said, "Fine."

591
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,411
Yes, I did.

592
00:24:57,114 --> 00:25:00,751
- That�s so sweet. 
- Oh no, my button broke.

593
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:02,190
Oh yeah? Let me see.

594
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:04,007
It just broke in two and fell.

595
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,302
Well, let me look, Mom.

596
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:07,105
It�s a broken button, what is there to look at?

597
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:08,944
All right, then, I think there�s a bathroom over there.

598
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:10,402
What can we do in a bathroom?

599
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:12,010
- Meet George Michael. 
- What?

600
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:13,034
Let�s go.

601
00:25:14,187 --> 00:25:16,722
I don�t believe it. This is a brand new skirt.

602
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:18,359
Mom, let me see.

603
00:25:18,523 --> 00:25:20,708
I have this dinner to go tonight. What am I going to do?

604
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,476
Drink a lot. It�s easier to explain

605
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:24,242
not wearing a skirt if you�re falling down drunk.

606
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:25,491
Thank you for the advice.

607
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,206
You know, I can rig this �til you get home.

608
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:29,363
- You can? 
- Yeah, just give me five seconds here.

609
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:33,074
- What is that? 
- It�s a paper clip.

610
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,042
And what do you intend to do with that paper clip?

611
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,201
I intend to carve something really dirty into the bathroom door.

612
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,178
- Lorelai. 
- What rhymes with Nantucket?

613
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,190
I�m standing here holding my skirt.

614
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:44,217
I�m gonna put this paper clip through the buttonhole

615
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:45,897
and then through the thread that used to hold the button,

616
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:47,704
and then you�re gonna put your jacket back on and there you go.

617
00:25:48,217 --> 00:25:49,839
- That�s ingenious. 
- I know.

618
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:52,005
If I had a thumbtack, I could make a scud missile.

619
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:55,523
You know, your father�s having a wonderful time.

620
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:57,130
Well, good.

621
00:25:57,295 --> 00:25:59,040
It means a lot to him to share this with Rory.

622
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:00,469
I know.

623
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:06,060
Actually, it means a lot to him to share this with you and Rory. It�s very nice that you�re here.

624
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,405
Nice for you. I just found out you�re not supposed to be my real mother,

625
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:10,633
so I�m a little scarred.

626
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:14,928
See that? That is my favorite building in the whole school.

627
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,429
- It is? 
- Yes, it is.

628
00:26:16,537 --> 00:26:17,254
Why?

629
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:19,814
Because that�s where the Timothy Dwight Dining Hall is.

630
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:22,016
I thought campus food was supposed to be disgusting.

631
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:23,419
Not Yale food.

632
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:25,554
They have the most delicious pot roast you�ve ever tasted.

633
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:28,113
- I love pot roast. 
- Who doesn�t love pot roast?

634
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:30,474
Are you having a good time?

635
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:31,709
I�m having a very good time.

636
00:26:31,872 --> 00:26:32,656
I�m glad.

637
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:36,410
It�s nice being able to show this place to another Gilmore generation.

638
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:42,927
You know, one day, when your mother was ten years old,

639
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,073
she ran into my office and she said,

640
00:26:45,201 --> 00:26:47,526
"I�m going to go to Yale, just like you."

641
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,428
She actually took my diploma out of my office and put it in her room.

642
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:54,576
She wouldn�t give it back to me for about six months.

643
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,902
This place makes you remember things.

644
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:02,318
Hopefully, things you�re being graded on.

645
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:05,155
All right, we�re all in one piece again.

646
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:06,568
Oh, glad to hear it.

647
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:08,221
Shall we continue?

648
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,664
Okay, but you�re not gonna show me the vending machine

649
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:12,835
where I was conceived, are you? �Cause I don�t think I can take it.

650
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,212
- Lions and tigers and bears... 
- Oh my.

651
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:22,087
It�s impressive, isn�t it?

652
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:23,843
Yeah, I�d like to open a checking account, please.

653
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,082
What is this place?

654
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:27,326
This is the main administration building.

655
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,000
Professors� offices, the dean�s office.

656
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:32,501
Some of the best scotch in the country can be found behind those doors.

657
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:33,915
Not sure how to take that, Dad.

658
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:36,050
Come on. Ah, follow me, please.

659
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,433
What�s he so excited about?

660
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:39,411
Oh, who knows?

661
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,888
Dickens must have dropped a pencil here at some point.

662
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:45,811
Rory, this is the office of a very dear friend of mine.

663
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,177
His name is Harris Fellows,

664
00:27:47,388 --> 00:27:49,717
and he just happens to be the Dean of Admissions.

665
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:51,294
- Really? 
- That�s right.

666
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,664
And I called him just before we came down and I asked him

667
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:56,081
if he had a little time to squeeze you in and he said yes.

668
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:58,489
- Squeeze me in? 
- For an interview.

669
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,723
An interview for what, Dad?

670
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,448
- An interview for Yale. 
- Grandpa.

671
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,558
Oh, I told him all about you and your grades

672
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:05,196
and how well you were doing at Chilton.

673
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:07,229
Of course, he insisted on seeing you.

674
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:08,443
He wouldn�t let me off the hook.

675
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:09,804
But I haven�t applied to Yale.

676
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:12,523
Oh, I told him that you weren�t finished deciding,

677
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:13,860
that you were being very picky.

678
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:15,882
I think that made him want you even more.

679
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:18,463
They can be very competitive, these Ivy League schools.

680
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:21,864
He�s expecting you at three. Oh, look, it�s three now.

681
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:24,731
Well, we timed this perfectly now, didn�t we?

682
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:26,721
Come on, I�ll walk you in. We�ll be right back.

683
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:29,109
Rory, honey, you don�t have to go in there.

684
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,724
What? Well, of course she�s going to go in there.

685
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:33,809
Rory, honey, the only person I�m talking to,

686
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:35,432
you don�t have to go in there if you don�t want to.

687
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:36,768
Lorelai, the man is waiting.

688
00:28:36,912 --> 00:28:38,525
You wanna leave? �Cause we could just leave.

689
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,568
No, it�s okay. I�ll go in.

690
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:42,723
Harris is a very nice man, Rory.

691
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:44,700
I think you two are really going to hit it off.

692
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:46,180
Come on, I�ll walk you in.

693
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,192
My skirt seems to be holding up very well.

694
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:05,626
- Lorelai... 
- No.

695
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:10,072
She shook his hand.

696
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:11,869
She just reached out and shook his hand.

697
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:14,299
It completely threw him off. I swear, that girl.

698
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,504
You know what, I almost feel like a standing ovation is in order.

699
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:20,546
If you�re going to get dramatic, let�s go outside.

700
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:21,894
It echoes in here.

701
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:23,036
What did you think you were doing?

702
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:25,110
I thought I was helping my granddaughter

703
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:28,422
get into what is, in my opinion, the best Ivy League school in America.

704
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,123
Even though she doesn�t wanna go here?

705
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:32,150
She doesn�t know she doesn�t want to go here.

706
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:33,282
You�re unbelievable, Dad.

707
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,565
You corner her alone the other night, without me there.

708
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:37,076
Of course I did. You wouldn�t let her go.

709
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:38,111
Oh, I wouldn�t?

710
00:29:38,264 --> 00:29:40,481
I knew that the last thing in the world that you could want

711
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,842
would be for Rory to go to Yale.

712
00:29:41,992 --> 00:29:43,252
And the reason for that would be?

713
00:29:43,394 --> 00:29:45,086
I went to Yale, therefore Rory can�t.

714
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:47,721
Oh, that�s right, the crazy reason.

715
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,552
That�s all right. It�s your prerogative to feel that way.

716
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:53,768
It�s mine to make sure that Rory at least knows all her options.

717
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:56,205
Aren�t you supposed to slap my face with a glove before you do this?

718
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:57,855
I�m not going to discuss this with you.

719
00:29:58,044 --> 00:29:59,836
You lied to everybody, Dad.

720
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,915
You lied to me, you lied to Rory, I�m looking at Mom

721
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:03,313
and I�m thinking you lied to her, too.

722
00:30:03,446 --> 00:30:05,232
Lorelai, please, let�s try and calm down.

723
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:06,641
This is for Rory�s own good.

724
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:08,582
- Rory�s going to Harvard. 
- We�ll see.

725
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:10,491
No, Rory�s going to Harvard.

726
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:13,988
It�s already been decided without you, get it?

727
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:15,360
You don�t control it.

728
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:18,832
And that little stunt of yours doesn�t change that fact one bit.

729
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:20,987
I�m sorry about the way it had to be done,

730
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:23,051
but I didn�t want to argue with you about it.

731
00:30:23,165 --> 00:30:25,504
My whole life, you have tried to control everything,

732
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:27,614
and if you didn�t get to control something,

733
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:29,150
then you just didn�t deal with it.

734
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:30,091
That�s ridiculous.

735
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,726
When you couldn�t control me, you didn�t deal with me.

736
00:30:31,848 --> 00:30:33,579
- This has nothing to do with you. 
- No?

737
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:35,867
This is about Rory and Rory�s education.

738
00:30:36,088 --> 00:30:38,786
Which, frankly Lorelai, is something you know nothing about.

739
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,978
Excuse me?

740
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,637
You never went to college, let alone an Ivy League college.

741
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,890
You don�t know the first thing about the system, the way it works.

742
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,452
I do, I went through it.

743
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:48,509
You want Rory to go to Harvard that badly?

744
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:50,506
So do thousands of other mothers.

745
00:30:50,655 --> 00:30:55,586
Yale is an excellent school, the equal of Harvard in every way except one �

746
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,567
I went here. I�m an alumnus.

747
00:30:57,742 --> 00:30:59,907
That makes it easier for Rory to get in.

748
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,655
And if you had any idea about the way the system works, you�d know this.

749
00:31:03,783 --> 00:31:06,088
Oh, so, here it is. I knew we would eventually get to the big

750
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:09,267
"my daughter�s a loser, poor me, the future squandered,

751
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,773
the Gilmore name�s sullied" speech.

752
00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:13,798
I am not going to leave Rory�s education to chance

753
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:16,211
simply because I might risk offending you.

754
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:18,567
Her future is more important than your pride.

755
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:20,226
If you don�t like that, I�m sorry.

756
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:22,728
If it makes you angry, well, what else is new?

757
00:31:22,872 --> 00:31:24,429
But that, my dear girl, is the way it is.

758
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:26,114
I�m calling a cab. We�re leaving.

759
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:33,590
Lorelai, come back inside.

760
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:36,339
Lorelai, put the phone away and come back inside.

761
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,621
Yes, hi, in New Haven, I need a number of a cab company.

762
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:41,710
Anyone, pick one. Thanks.

763
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:44,301
You are not going to take a cab all the way back to Stars Hollow.

764
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,272
He lied to you, too, Mom. Don�t you care about that?

765
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:47,823
That is between me and your father.

766
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:49,083
Great, whatever.

767
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,891
Damn, I just forgot the number.

768
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:53,508
If you would just calm down and look at it from his point of view.

769
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:56,457
Hi... in New Haven,

770
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:57,793
I need a cab company, any cab company.

771
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:00,675
Your father is a very strong-willed man, Lorelai.

772
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:02,298
You know this, you take after him.

773
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:03,025
Thank you.

774
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:05,606
He wants the best for Rory. He thinks this is the best.

775
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:06,703
It doesn�t really matter what he thinks.

776
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,410
It matters what I think and what Rory thinks and the list ends there.

777
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:10,982
So Rory takes a meeting at Yale.

778
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,647
That doesn�t mean she still won�t go to Harvard.

779
00:32:12,754 --> 00:32:14,347
I know it doesn�t, because she is still going to Harvard.

780
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,890
- If she applies to Yale... 
- She�s not applying to Yale!

781
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:19,672
And gets into Yale, that might even make her more appealing to Harvard.

782
00:32:19,778 --> 00:32:20,598
Have you thought about that?

783
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:23,369
No, I haven�t, because I�m not trying to reason away a crazy man�s actions.

784
00:32:23,497 --> 00:32:25,443
Oh, don�t do this. Don�t turn this into yet another one

785
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:27,875
of your crusades against your childhood. Just let it go.

786
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,385
Realize that despite the matter in which your father did this, his intentions were honorable.

787
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:34,393
You know what, Mom? Sometimes I literally sit around

788
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:36,958
and try to figure out why Dad and I have such an awful relationship.

789
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:38,607
I try to figure out why we can�t communicate

790
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:41,936
and why we can�t seem to break through whatever crap it is that stands between us,

791
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:44,071
and then something like this happens and suddenly it�s like,

792
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:46,564
- �Oh yeah. That�s why.� 
- Fine, Lorelai,

793
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:49,820
your father�s a demon. He�s cruel and out to destroy your happiness.

794
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:51,203
But think about this...

795
00:32:51,392 --> 00:32:54,654
you�re fighting so hard to send Rory off to Harvard no matter what

796
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:57,552
that you haven�t even stopped for one second to consider that if she went to Yale,

797
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,634
she could live at home. Consider that on your cab ride.

798
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:07,337
Hi, yes, in New Haven, I need a cab company.

799
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:10,562
It was a pleasure to meet you.

800
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:12,294
I�ll read that book you recommended.

801
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:15,345
And don�t be fooled by the Oprah seal on the cover, it�s actually very good.

802
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:18,244
Well, how did it go? I see that everyone is smiling.

803
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:21,091
Richard, your granddaughter is everything you said and more.

804
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:22,504
You should be very proud.

805
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:23,748
I am, very proud.

806
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,898
- It was very nice meeting you. 
- Same here.

807
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:27,936
- I�ll see you at dinner later, Richard. 
- Thanks, Harris.

808
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:31,658
Well, that sounded like it went very well.

809
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:33,512
What did you tell him to read?

810
00:33:33,697 --> 00:33:35,084
- Why did you do that? 
- Do what?

811
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:37,168
Why did you make this appointment without telling me about it?

812
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:39,672
Rory, I know this appointment upset your mother,

813
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,383
but this was an important opportunity.

814
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,076
I know it was an important opportunity.

815
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:45,299
That�s why I can�t believe you didn�t prepare me for it.

816
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,864
I didn�t have my transcripts, my letters of recommendation.

817
00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:50,685
I couldn�t even remember what I wanted to major in when he asked.

818
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:52,673
I�m sure he knew you were nervous.

819
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,295
But I didn�t have to be that nervous.

820
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,600
I could�ve been calm. I could�ve brushed my hair.

821
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:58,980
- I never would�ve worn this. 
- Oh, Rory, none of this matters.

822
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:01,398
It matters to me. I like to be prepared.

823
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:04,644
This has nothing to do with Mom. If you had really wanted me to take this meeting,

824
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:06,610
I would�ve done it just because you asked me to.

825
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:07,952
And I would�ve done it right.

826
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:10,886
Rory, a cab is meeting us at the main gate. Let�s go.

827
00:34:10,972 --> 00:34:11,853
I�m coming.

828
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:14,178
- Bye Grandma. 
- Goodbye Rory.

829
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:18,756
Don�t you even look at me.

830
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:23,270
Thanks.

831
00:34:28,217 --> 00:34:29,406
Well, here�s the good news.

832
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:31,557
You no longer have to worry about which college to go to

833
00:34:31,756 --> 00:34:33,548
�cause that cab ride was your college tuition.

834
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:36,159
Can we not say the word college for at least forty-eight hours?

835
00:34:36,328 --> 00:34:37,643
- Fine. 
- Thank you.

836
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,662
How �bout collage, can we say collage?

837
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:41,607
�Cause it sounds the same but it�s actually very different.

838
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,646
Collage is fine.

839
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:44,800
Okay, good, �cause I don�t even know how

840
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:46,860
to get through a conversation without the word collage.

841
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:49,891
I should�ve listened to you about today.

842
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:50,988
Oh, no.

843
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,655
There�s no way even I could�ve seen this one coming.

844
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:58,037
I can�t believe I had a meeting at Yale today.

845
00:34:58,284 --> 00:34:59,298
I know.

846
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:01,259
And I can�t believe the only name that popped into my head

847
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:03,440
when he asked for my role model was Gloria Estefan.

848
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,807
Well, you don�t work great under pressure.

849
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:07,998
- Sucky day. 
- But excellent tacos.

850
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,411
Yeah, Hector really came through.

851
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:10,454
What are you doing?

852
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:12,211
We�re coming from a day with my parents. Want a taco?

853
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:14,572
No thanks. See, I already have food here.

854
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:18,382
We sell it to the other customers who don�t come quite as prepared as the two of you.

855
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:20,235
Be nice and get us some salsa.

856
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:23,025
- At least order a cup of coffee. 
- Coffee and tacos?

857
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:24,450
Sounds just gross enough to work.

858
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:29,452
Please, I�ll finish it � hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. I�m getting the coffee.

859
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:31,965
I gotta run out for a second and get a part for my car.

860
00:35:32,104 --> 00:35:33,134
Get a receipt this time.

861
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:35,535
I�ll be back.

862
00:35:36,497 --> 00:35:39,017
Hey Luke, what�s the record for most tacos eaten in a diner

863
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,449
that doesn�t actually sell tacos?

864
00:35:40,558 --> 00:35:41,535
I have no idea.

865
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:44,470
Find out, will you, �cause if it�s less than five, we�re famous.

866
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:45,765
Where�d you get those things anyhow?

867
00:35:45,904 --> 00:35:47,736
- New Haven. 
- Really? That dump was close?

868
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:49,767
We paid a little visit to Yale today.

869
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:51,944
Yes, one that I would prefer not to relive,

870
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:52,978
thank you very much.

871
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:54,495
I�m gonna go study.

872
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:55,652
Okay hon, see you back home.

873
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:56,855
- Bye Luke. 
- Bye.

874
00:35:59,445 --> 00:36:01,157
Listen, I just want you to know

875
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:02,650
that I had a little talk with Jess earlier.

876
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:04,659
- You did? 
- Yes, I did,

877
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:06,973
and I really laid down the rules concerning him and Rory.

878
00:36:07,116 --> 00:36:09,937
Trust me, he now knows that I am going to be watching them

879
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:12,549
- every second they are together. 
- Oh good.

880
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,448
- You know, they�re together now. 
- What?

881
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,146
Oh yeah. �I have to get a part for my car�,

882
00:36:17,228 --> 00:36:18,954
�I�m going to go study� � that�s kid code for

883
00:36:19,037 --> 00:36:21,991
�Meet me at the previously agreed upon location far away from my clueless uncle.�

884
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:24,173
You�re kidding me, right? You don�t really think that...

885
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:27,326
Damn, they are! They�re together.

886
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:29,113
They used the kid code and now they�re together!

887
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:30,772
- It�s okay, Luke. 
- It�s okay, Luke?

888
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:33,932
They are out there right now doing God knows what, completely unsupervised.

889
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,769
- How did you let this happen? 
- Me?

890
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,705
Yes, you. I thought you were against this.

891
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,772
I thought you were all, �This is so great and Rory�s gonna change Jess.�

892
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,086
What is she, a miracle worker? Come on, Lorelai, wake up...

893
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:46,690
the guy�s trouble. I have to find �em. Caesar, I�ll be back in a little while.

894
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,158
You�re seriously gonna run all over town looking for Jess and Rory?

895
00:36:50,312 --> 00:36:51,646
If I have to, yes.

896
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:54,459
And if you were really a concerned mother, you�d go out there with me.

897
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:55,816
No, I can�t do that.

898
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,558
But if you like, I�ll let you sniff Rory�s sweater.

899
00:36:57,726 --> 00:36:59,657
Maybe her scent will help you track them down.

900
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:03,071
The things you find amusing astound me sometimes.

901
00:37:05,437 --> 00:37:06,656
You�re not really gonna sniff it.

902
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,190
No, it�s cold out. She might need it.

903
00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:29,293
You going to smoke that or mind meld with it?

904
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:30,455
It depends.

905
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:33,947
So where�s the part for your car?

906
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,011
I don�t know.

907
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:39,109
Gypsy said she was gonna leave it for me somewhere.

908
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:43,194
- Guess she forgot. 
- She�s bad that way.

909
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:44,900
I�m just gonna have to take my business elsewhere.

910
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:45,913
Looks that way.

911
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:49,215
- So. 
- So.

912
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:52,007
- Here we are. 
- Yeah, here we are.

913
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:59,391
So, tell me, what�s your decision about smoking that depending on?

914
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:00,743
On what�s gonna happen.

915
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:02,662
- When? 
- Now.

916
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,092
I�m glad you didn�t smoke it.

917
00:38:23,272 --> 00:38:24,306
- Oh yeah? 
- Yeah.

918
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:43,564
Well, whatever else happens between us,

919
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:45,044
at least we know that part works.

920
00:38:48,218 --> 00:38:49,094
What?

921
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:50,297
I have to go.

922
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,270
What?

923
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:53,343
Did I do something or...

924
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:55,836
No, no. This was...

925
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,398
you were � are...

926
00:38:58,827 --> 00:38:59,778
it was wonderful,

927
00:39:00,108 --> 00:39:03,159
and I look forward to many similar occurrences in the future,

928
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:06,077
but right now, I have to go. Understand?

929
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:07,373
Not at all.

930
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:09,166
It�s more fun that way, isn�t it?

931
00:39:11,378 --> 00:39:12,150
Come here.

932
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:22,160
Beat it.

933
00:39:23,205 --> 00:39:24,250
I�ll see you tomorrow.

934
00:40:01,494 --> 00:40:03,246
- What are you doing? 
- I climbed a tree.

935
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:04,301
Why?

936
00:40:05,023 --> 00:40:07,952
Well, I was afraid to ring the doorbell

937
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:10,144
�cause your mom would answer and I assume she knows,

938
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:11,551
so I assume she hates me and...

939
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:13,543
 I just wanted to talk to you, so...

940
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:15,207
- She doesn�t know. 
- She doesn�t.

941
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:17,153
I haven�t really been in the mood to talk about it.

942
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,323
But you�re going to have to tell her eventually,

943
00:40:19,805 --> 00:40:22,539
so if she did answer the door and was nice to me,

944
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:25,485
then I would�ve known that she was going to be hating me soon,

945
00:40:25,637 --> 00:40:29,006
and that just would�ve been really hard because I like your mom.

946
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,702
I guess you�re probably gonna tell your sister also,

947
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:35,253
so she�s probably gonna hate me, too.

948
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,549
Well, too bad, Rory.

949
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:38,351
Somebody doesn�t like you for once.

950
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,000
- I didn�t mean... 
- What do you want?

951
00:40:40,419 --> 00:40:43,565
Do you remember that girl Butterfly who lived in a tree for a year?

952
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:46,835
I can officially attest that she was nuts.

953
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:48,649
I have to go.

954
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:51,004
I wanna say that I�m sorry.

955
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:52,027
For what?

956
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:53,501
For treating you the way I did.

957
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,356
For doing all the things you said I did.

958
00:40:55,566 --> 00:40:58,627
I am so, so sorry. It�s all my fault.

959
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,298
I don�t know what�s wrong with me.

960
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,706
You were the most amazing boyfriend in the world.

961
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:05,202
You made me so happy.

962
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:08,111
You made me laugh, you made my mother like you,

963
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,820
you were nice to my friends, you protected me,

964
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:13,932
you even came with me to that stupid debutante ball.

965
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:15,294
I don�t need the list.

966
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:17,978
I really did love you.

967
00:41:19,135 --> 00:41:20,267
Please believe that.

968
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:23,962
You with him now?

969
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:25,463
I don�t wanna talk about him.

970
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:29,144
I just came to tell you that I�m truly sorry that I hurt you,

971
00:41:29,902 --> 00:41:32,708
and that I�m going to miss you so much,

972
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:36,672
and I just hope that someday you won�t hate me anymore.

973
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:41,607
I hope so, too.

974
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:55,754
Coffee and Ovaltine.

975
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:56,775
Thanks.

976
00:41:57,788 --> 00:41:59,027
It�s getting late, you almost done?

977
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,820
Almost.

978
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:02,325
Don�t study so much that you get brilliant, go mad,

979
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:04,813
grow a big bald egghead and try to take over the world, okay,

980
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,344
�cause I wanna go shoe shopping this weekend.

981
00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:08,689
Promise, I will not go mad until we get you some boots.

982
00:42:08,802 --> 00:42:09,565
Thank you.

983
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,248
- Hey. 
- Yeah?

984
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,805
How was the rest of the evening?

985
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,048
It was eventful.

986
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:22,227
Eventful... well, okay.

987
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:23,769
Goodnight hon.

988
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:25,269
Mom?

989
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:27,254
- Yeah? 
- Details tomorrow.

990
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,694
Ah, thank God.

991
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:30,481
�Cause you know what not knowing these things does to me.

992
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:31,925
- I know. 
- I can�t sleep.

993
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,428
I wonder what I did wrong. Should I not have left you that first day

994
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:38,304
in kindergarten when you begged me not to? Are you holding it against me?

995
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:41,530
I was fine staying at kindergarten. You were the one that had trouble leaving.

996
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,395
See, see how irrational I get when you hold out on me?

997
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:45,479
I invent crazy reasons why you hold out on me.

998
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:46,625
- Night Mom. 
- Night babe.
